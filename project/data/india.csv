CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin Tuesday described the National Education Policy (NEP) a “destructive plan of Nagpur” (referring to the RSS headquarters) and said DMK will never accept it.“Instead of bringing students into education, the NEP’s action plan is to push students out of it. I have already said that even if you give Rs 10,000 crore, we will not accept the destructive plan of Nagpur. I am saying this again with conviction,” Stalin said in Chengalpattu at a meeting to distribute welfare measures.On the sparring between DMK MPs and Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday, Stalin said, “Dharmendra Pradhan is speaking arrogantly asking us to accept Hindi and Sanskrit under the three-language policy .In the name of three-language policy, their aim is to destroy the educational progress of Tamil Nadu.” The CM claimed NEP encourages privatisation of education , ensures that only the rich get access to higher education, imposes communalism, makes public examination compulsory for even smaller classes, and results in the accumulation of power for the centre.","Tamil nadu cm mk stalin described the national education policy (nep) as a ‘destructive plan of nagpur’ (referring to the rss headquarters) stalin claimed nep encourages privatisation of education, ensures that only the rich get access to higher education and imposes communalism.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118909294,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-78196,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

"'Eyesore, public nuisance': Delhi court orders FIR against Arvind Kejriwal over alleged misuse of funds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-court-orders-fir-against-arvind-kejriwal-over-alleged-public-property-defacement/articleshow/118890069.cms,"Court cites public nuisance and safety concerns

Investigation ordered amid allegations of cover-up

Legal proceedings revived after initial dismissal

A Delhi court on Tuesday directed the police to file an FIR against former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and others in a case of public property defacement . Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Neha Mittal passed the order based on a complaint by Shiv Kumar Saxena, who provided visual evidence of banners featuring Kejriwal and other AAP leaders placed illegally across the city.The court noted that the large-sized banners installed by Kejriwal, former MLA Gulab Singh, and former Dwarka Councillor Nitika Sharma not only defaced public property but also posed traffic hazards. ""Deaths caused by the collapse of illegal hoardings are not new in India,"" the court observed, emphasizing the seriousness of the offence.It ruled that ""hanging a banner board or affixing hoardings"" amounted to defacement under Section 3 of the Delhi Prevention of Defacement of Property Act, 2007. The court instructed the concerned Station House Officer (SHO) to register an FIR immediately under this provision.The court criticized the police's previous handling of the complaint, noting that an action taken report (ATR) submitted by the SHO failed to confirm whether the hoardings existed on the alleged date. ""The ATR stating that no hoardings were found appears to be an attempt to hoodwink the court,"" the order said.The court directed the police to thoroughly investigate the origins of the banners, including details of their printing and installation. It dismissed arguments from the public prosecutor regarding the omission of certain names from the complaint, stating that the investigating agency has the authority to include individuals not originally named.Saxena had first filed his complaint in 2019, alleging that Kejriwal and his associates misused public funds to install large hoardings in Dwarka. A magisterial court initially dismissed the plea in 2022, but a sessions court later ordered a fresh review.""The matter is remanded back to the trial court to decide the application under Section 156(3) CrPC afresh,"" the sessions court had ruled in January.With the latest directive, the Delhi Police now faces a deadline to register the FIR and submit a compliance report, setting the stage for a renewed legal battle for Kejriwal and the AAP leadership.","Court orders police to file an fir against former chief minister arvind kejriwal.

""When will Rahul Gandhi expel BJP supporters from Congress?"" posted the former CM of Madhya Pradesh on X.Rahul Gandhi, while addressing party workers in Ahmedabad on Saturday, suggested that some were ""cut off"" from the people and half of them were ""in cahoots"" with the BJP. ""The leadership of Gujarat, the workers of Gujarat, the district presidents (Congress) of Gujarat, the block presidents, there are two types of people in them, there are divisions.

He was told Hindus would get angry if he said anything against the RSS. ""The Sangh does not represent the Hindus. It only misleads and exploits the Hindus in the name of religion,"" Digvijaya said adding that the Hindus have Shankaracharyas as their leaders.

NEW DELHI: Sharing that an investment of Rs 2.5 lakh crore will be coming to the NorthEast, home minister Amit Shah Tuesday said no youth from the region would have to migrate to another part of the country for work in next 10 years as they will find employment there itself.Recalling the slew of initiatives made in 10 years of Modi govt to restore peace, lay the foundation of development and increase connectivity in the NorthEast, Shah, in his address at NorthEast Students and Youth Parliament organised by Student Experience in Inter-State Living (SEIL), said budget for NorthEast had been raised by 153% in 2024-25 as compared to 2014-15.Shah elaborated Rs 90,000 crore was spent specifically on roads in the NorthEast, 64 new air routes started and Rs 18,000 crore allocated for railway connectivity in the region. “By 2027, the capitals of all states in the NorthEast will be connected by train, air, and road,” he added.While praising the NorthEast for having youth with highest IQ in India, along with diversity — 220 tribal groups, 160 tribes and rich culture and traditions — the home minister lamented how the region had fallen behind in development under past govts on account of sustained insurgency, violence and blockades. He said the NorthEast had to face a 40-year delay in development, with terrorism and separatism being the primary obstacles.Shah credited BJP govt for always prioritising the NorthEast through initiatives like creating a dedicated ministry for the region under Vajpayee govt, talking and working with insurgent groups to bring them into mainstream and end conflict, and pushing development initiatives in the region. Shah said violent incidents in the NorthEast had declined by 70% between 2014 and 2024 and civilian deaths by 89%. As many as 10,500 insurgents had surrendered with their weapons in the past decade, he added.","Home minister amit shah said no youth from the region would have to migrate to another part of the country for work in next 10 years.

India, US will negotiate ‘mutually beneficial’ trade agreement

NEW DELHI: The debate on the Manipur budget and the Centre’s supplementary demand for grants turned into an extension of the language controversy in Tamil Nadu with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday accusing DMK of hypocrisy.“I do not want to name him, but the moment I read the passages, anyone with a small, faint familiarity with Tamil will know who I'm speaking about. So, when this person speaks about Tamil, much horribly, there’s no objection. On the contrary, they would keep his photo. They will also say he is our Dravidian icon,” she said while quoting the “elderly person” from various Tamil magazines in what was seen as a reference to Periyar, the leader of the Dravidian movement.Coming to the defence of her colleague, education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, Sitharaman said he was made to withdraw his remarks just for saying that the protest by DMK members was uncivil. “But a man who repeatedly says Tamil is a barbaric language, they keep his photograph in every room, they garland him and worship him and say he is the icon of Dravidian movement. Look at their hypocrisy,” she said.She also listed out a series of projects where the Centre was assisting Tamil Nadu.Earlier, replying to the debate on Manipur budget, Sitharaman said all financial support would be provided to the state for economic development as she stressed the overall law and order situation had improved, except for some sporadic incidents.Lok Sabha passed supplementary demands for grants, which entails Rs 51,463 crore additional spending in the current fiscal and the Manipur budget for the 2025-26 fiscal. The lower House also passed, by voice vote, the Rs 1,291 crore demands for excess grants for 2021-22 fiscal and the Rs 1,861 crore supplementary demands for grants for Manipur in 2024-25.“With the collective effort of both the Centre and state govts, there has been an improvement in overall law and order situation in the state, to a large extent, except for some sporadic (incidents),” Sitharaman said.She also assured that all financial support will be provided to Manipur for faster economic development.The FM also took a swipe at TMC’s Kriti Azad, who had been critical of the Modi govt that it had lied in the past 11 years and didn’t fulfil promises it made while he accused the Centre of not releasing funds allocated to states including West Bengal.“I will appreciate Kriti Azad if he speaks about corruption in West Bengal one day. The CAG report has cited corruption of over Rs 2 lakh crore in West Bengal. Even the state CM had acknowledged corruption in the state as she had asked her party colleagues to return the ‘cut money’,” she said amid protests by the TMC MPs.While asserting that India’s tariffs were way below the commitment at WTO, govt on Tuesday told Parliament that New Delhi and Washington intend to negotiate a “mutually beneficial” trade agreement that will seek to lower import duty, address non-tariff barriers, and look at ways to enhance supply chain integration.Commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal , who returned from the US, is due to meet exporters on Thursday as they seek clarity on where the negotiations are headed so that they can prepare to navigate through the latest turbulence in global trade amid repeated attacks by US President Donald Trump on India’s “high tariffs‘. On Tuesday, Goyal’s deputy Jitin Prasada also made it clear that currently, the US has not imposed any reciprocal tariff on India.“The US has issued a memorandum on reciprocal trade and tariffs on Feb 13, 2025, wherein the secretary of commerce and US trade representative are to take necessary actions to investigate harm to US and provide a report with detailed proposed remedies , based on which, US action against relevant trading partner could, thereafter be undertaken under any of the relevant US legislations,” he said.","Finance minister nirmala sitharaman accuses dmk of hypocrisy.

NEW DELHI: A heated exchange erupted in Rajya Sabha on Tuesday over Congress president and leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge ’s “aapko theek se thokenge” remark, with BJP strongly protesting against the “expression” and demanded its expungement as well as an apology from him.The confrontation was set off while the opposition was agitating for an apology from education minister Dharmendra Pradhan for his remark accusing DMK MPs of fudging facts over the language row and dubbing them “uncivilized” and “undemocratic”. Congress senior MP Digvijaya Singh was speaking when Kharge rose, leading deputy chairperson Harivansh to say that he had already been allowed to speak and that it was now his colleague’s turn.Kharge was not amused. “This is a dictatorship. I request you (deputy chairman) with folded hands to allow me (to speak). Hum poori tayyari se aaye hain aur aapko kya kya thokna hai thik se thokenge, sarkar ko bhi thokenge (the opposition is prepared to corner the govt),” he said while looking at Harivansh. While the deputy chairperson reminded that he was not party to the partisan squabble, Leader of House, health minister J P Nadda came down heavily on the LOP condemning the choice of his language which he termed as derogatory to the Chair.“The language used by the LOP, the aspersions on the chair, is condemnable. This is to be condemned by one and all. The words and language used for the chair is unpardonable, still he should apologise, and the word should be expunged,” he said.Deputy chairman Harivansh too disapproved of Kharge’s remarks, emphasising the need for respectful discourse in the House. In response, Kharge apologised, clarifying that his comments were aimed at govt policies, not the Chair. “I apologise, I never spoke against you. I criticised govt’s policy, and I say sorry if my words seemed harsh to you,” he said.","Congress president and leader of opposition mallikarjun kharge ’s ‘aapko theek se thokenge’ remark.

Delimitation will punish states that controlled population: Congress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delimitation-will-punish-states-that-controlled-population-congress/articleshow/118908686.cms,"Jaisram Ramesh

NEW DELHI: In first remarks on delimitation since a fresh row on the fraught issue broke out last month, Congress Tuesday said states which achieved early success in family planning will lose seats because of the redrawing of constituencies as per the population criteria. The party said delimitation will “penalise” the states that worked in line with the national objective, listing key northern states as major gainers and southern and eastern states as losers.Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said, “The distribution of seats across states in the Lok Sabha is presently based on the 1971 Census. Article 82 that was amended with effect from Feb 2002 provides for a fresh distribution based on the population data from the first Census after 2026.”He quoted a study done by Milan Vaishnav and Jamie Hintson in 2019, which distributed seats across the states based on the estimated population in 2026. As per its findings, Ramesh said, “The states that lose seats are Tamil Nadu (8), Kerala (8), Andhra Pradesh and Telangana (8), Odisha (3), West Bengal (4), Karnataka (2), Himachal Pradesh (1), Punjab (1) and Uttarakhand (1).” He added that Assam, J&K and Maharashtra will not gain or lose any seats. “The states that gain are Uttar Pradesh (11), Bihar (10), Rajasthan (6), Madhya Pradesh (4), Jharkhand (1), Haryana (1), Gujarat (1), Delhi (1), and Chhattisgarh (1).”Ramesh said the states that controlled population “will be penalised for it”.While Congress has in the past said that delimitation should not hurt the states which performed well in population control , this is its first remark after a controversy broke out following the red flag raised by Tamil Nadu last month. There has been a view that as a national party, Congress may prefer to play safe as opposing delimitation on population criteria may result in a backlash in the heartland states whose share would go up in such an exercise.DMK head and TN chief minister MK Stalin Friday wrote to his counterparts of southern states and Odisha, West Bengal and Punjab to be part of a Joint Action Committee launched for an “uncompromising fight against this unfair exercise”. He has also invited CPI(M), CPI, Congress, AIMIM, JD(S), Akali Dal, YSRCP, TDP, BRS, Jana Sena, TMC, AAP and BJP units of Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Punjab, Odisha and West Bengal for a meeting on March 22.",Congress said states that achieved early success in family planning will lose seats.

Amid doubts raised by some opposition parties on voter lists and electors photo identity cards ( EPIC ), the Election Commission has invited suggestions from all national and state parties by April 30 on any unresolved issues at the level of electoral registration officer (ERO), district election officer (DEO) or chief electoral officer (CEO).The initiative to engage with political parties — including through a suggested interaction with their presidents and senior leaders at a mutually convenient time — to allay their concerns and strengthen electoral processes came even as the EC separately heard delegations of parties like BJP TMC and BJD on Tuesday on issues ranging from bogus voters, duplicate EPIC numbers to voter turnout data.The BJP delegation claimed that over 13 lakh duplicate voters were added to the electoral roll in West Bengal during TMC’s rule, with “systematic infiltration” of illegal Bangladeshi and Rohingya immigrants into the rolls and 8,415 voters issued the same EPIC numbers. TMC raised concerns regarding duplicate EPIC numbers, and duplicate, shifted and dead voters.The BJD delegation requested the record of votes polled during simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly polls in the state last year, which, the EC said, was already shared with candidates’ polling agents in Form 17C.",The election commission has invited suggestions from all national and state parties by april 30 on any unresolved issues.

NEW DELHI: Opposition parties on Tuesday kept up their protests inside and outside Parliament over issues such as duplicate EPIC numbers, the three-language formula and delimitation but did not stall House proceedings.On the alleged “voter card fraud” that Trinamool Congress first flagged with a list of duplicate EPIC numbers, the party was supported by Congress, BJD and others which walked out of Rajya Sabha in the morning. Later, a TMC delegation of 10 MPs marched to the Election Commission for a meeting with the poll panel. BJD also met the full bench of the EC to flag the issue.DMK MPs staged a protest in the Parliament complex against the three-language formula under the new National Education Policy and demanded that education minister Dharmendra Pradhan apologise for his remarks against the Tamil Nadu govt. Congress MPs from Tamil Nadu wore black in solidarity and joined the protest. DMK MPs raised slogans outside the House and carried posters saying ‘Tamil Nadu educates, BJP manipulates’. MDMK MP Vaiko alleged the three-language policy was aimed at destroying states.TMC leaders met the EC and alleged that Aadhaar cards were being cloned which could lead to the possibility of these being used for fake voter registrations. The party demanded that the EC issue a separate list of voter deletions, new additions and modifications with every new revised poll roll.Party MP Sagarika Ghose expressed scepticism over the poll panel’s recent statement assuring that the concerns would be addressed in three months. “This is an extremely serious issue. Ever since West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee flagged the issue, all parties have realised it's a serious issue that poses a threat to electoral democracy,” she said, adding, “The EC says it will resolve the issue in three months... We are asking if you don't even know the number, how are you giving the deadline?”On the delimitation issue, Rajya Sabha proceedings were disrupted for about 40 minutes as opposition MPs stormed the well, protesting the impact of constituency redrawing based solely on population, which they argued would disadvantage southern states.","Opposition parties kept up their protests inside and outside parliament over issues such as duplicate epic numbers, the three-language formula and delimitation.

'Hate Speech'

TMC slams Suvendu for ‘dangerous and provocative’ remarks



KOLKATA: Bengal’s leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari sparked outrage on Tuesday by declaring BJP would “physically throw Muslim MLAs out of the assembly” after the party “forms the next govt” in the Trinamool-governed state that goes to polls in 2026.CM Mamata Banerjee ’s party protested the remark, terming it “hate speech” and questioning Adhikari’s “mental stability” after the defection of BJP’s Haldia MLA Tapasi Mondal to its ranks the previous day.Adhikari, who was suspended from the assembly on Feb 17 till the end of the budget session, labelled the Mamata govt “a communal administration that is behaving like the second version of Muslim League”. “The people of Bengal will uproot them this time,” he told reporters outside the assembly.The state BJP brass declined comment on Suvendu Adhikari’s remarks.Trinamool spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said it didn’t behove an elected representative to use such incendiary language against fellow legislators. “In Parliament or state assemblies, there can be debate and arguments. But to rake up religion and target MLAs belonging to a specific community is contrary to the principles of the Constitution. It’s dangerous, provocative and depraved. It’s also a criminal offence.”This isn’t the first instance of Adhikari’s statements causing unease even in his party. After BJP’s below-par performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls in Bengal, Adhikari had called for an end to the party’s ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ slogan.“I will say ‘Jo hamare saath, hum unke saath’. We don’t need minority morcha,” he said, causing party colleagues to publicly disown the remark.","Suvendu adhikari sparked outrage on tuesday by declaring bjp would “physically throw muslim mlas out of the assembly” after the party “forms the next govt” in the trinamool-governed state that goes to polls in 2026.

Survivor asked to appear before medical board today



JAIPUR: A single-judge bench of Rajasthan high court has permitted a 13-year-old rape survivor to undergo medical termination of her pregnancy of 27 weeks and six days. The court said if the fetus survives, the hospital should make arrangements for incubation, and the child should be brought up at the expense of the state govt. In case of the fetus’s death, the court mandated preservation of the DNA test report.An FIR of rape was registered on March 3 after the girl’s pregnancy was discovered in hospital. The girl and her family said the accused threatened her to keep quiet.The rape survivor has been asked to appear before the medical board with parents on Wednesday.Justice Sudesh Bansal instructed the medical superintendent of Mahila Chikitsalya at Sanganeri Gate, Jaipur, to make arrangements for the procedure. The petitioner’s counsel Sonia Shandilya said, “The petitioner is a minor girl whose parents, too, have given consent for termination of the pregnancy. The parents are agreeable to high risk of surgical intervention. We maintained that it would be gravely injurious to her mental health if her pregnancy is not allowed to be terminated.”The petitioner added, “We told the court that there are many cases where the high courts and SC have allowed abortion even for a 28-week (7-month) pregnant woman.”Under the MTP Act , any married woman, rape survivor, disabled woman and minor girl is allowed to abort pregnancy up to 24 weeks.","A single-judge bench of rajasthan high court has permitted a 13-year-old rape survivor to undergo medical termination of her pregnancy.
