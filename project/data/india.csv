NEW DELHI: In a first, India will get a twin-tube underwater tunnel that will have provision for movement of both vehicle and trains, boosting faster movement of forces and ammunition in case of any exigency, reports Dipak Dash.An inter-ministerial panel, headed by the expenditure secretary has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across Brahmaputra river in Assam connecting Gohpur and Numaligarh. One of the tubes will have provision for a single rail track.As per design, there will be no vehicular movement when trains run through this tube. It will have ballistic track and the trains will run on electricity. The total project of 33.7km, including the tunnel, approach roads and railway track will cost around Rs 18,600 crore. Once the project is complete, travel time between Gohpur and Numaligarh will reduce from current six-and-half hours to just 30 minutes, shortening the distance from 240km to 34km. This will enhance connectivity to Arunachal, Manipur, and other northeastern states.The project cost will be borne by road transport, railways and defence ministry.Designed as two unidirectional tunnels with two lanes each, these will be built 32m below Brahmaputra's deepest bed level. The project is expected to be completed in five years after the award of work.Officials said the projects will be placed before Union cabinet for approval and this may happen before Assam assembly polls. Last year, finance ministry had green signalled a road tunnel costing around Rs 14,900 crore with provision of 80:20 funding by road transport ministry and defence ministry. But following a decision to build road-cum-railway tunnels where it's feasible, govt had identified three such tunnels for North-East chicken neck corridor, across Brahmaputra in Assam and on Maranahally-Addahole (Shiradi Ghat) stretch in Karnataka, which TOI first reported on Oct 6, 2025.Officials said because of provision of railway track in one tunnel the cost has gone up.","An inter-ministerial panel has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across brahmaputra river in assam.

'No change in policy'

Removing hurdles

NEW DELHI: While land acquisition, and forest and wildlife clearances are the main hurdles for delay in infrastructure projects that have been addressed by Pragati, the platform for large projects led by PM Modi, Cabinet secretary TV Somanathan made it clear Friday that development won't be at the cost of democracy.Asked about amendments to the current policy, Somanathan said: ""In a democracy we need to strike a balance... We want to implement projects with the consent of people and after public consultation.""The comment comes amid demands from a section of the business community to review the land acquisition policy to speed up the implementation of projects, with the corporate sector often citing the Chinese model of infrastructure creation.While BJP govt did seek to amend land acquisition law in its first term, it left it to the states to offer a simpler regime. Responding to a question, cabinet secretary TV Somanathan said govt has no plans to change its land acquisition policy.The data shared by Somananthan at a press conference showed 35% of 7,735 issues raised under multi-layer Pragati were related to land acquisition, followed by 20% dealing with wildlife and forest clearances.Manoj Govil, secretary coordination in the cabinet secretariat, said the average time taken for forest and wildlife clearance has come down from over 600 days to around 75 days as learnings from Pragati have been part of the administrative process.Of 382 projects reviewed by the PM in 50 meetings, almost two-thirds related to land and forest. Among the sectors, roads was on top (114 projects), followed by railways (109) and power (54). For railways and roads, at least half the issues are related to land acquisition.In a rare press conference, Somananthan said so far projects of Rs 85 lakh crore have been cleared by the PM-led panel as states and Centre have worked together to resolve the issues. Citing the example of Jammu-Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla rail link, the country's highest-ranking civil servant said the project was approved in 1994 and by the time it reached Pragati in 2015, only 40% of the work had been done. It was finally commissioned last June after being monitored at the highest level. He said had the project not been taken up under Pragati, it would have been completed only by Jan 2038.He said by removing bottlenecks, Pragati had created a platform for higher capital expenditure by govt. ""All states, irrespective of political dispensations, want to complete their projects and all chief secretaries have been very responsive in resolving issues,"" he said.On impact of review of projects by PM under this initiative, Somanathan said on average, one issue was resolved every working day after review under Pragati.Besides projects, the platform is used to review 61 govt schemes such as One Nation, One Ration Card, PM Jan Aarogya Yojna, PM Awas Yojna, PM Swanidhi Yojna, Swachh Bharat Mission, Rera, and grievances across 36 sectors were taken up for review.","Cabinet secretary tv somanathan says development won't be at cost of democracy.

JAIPUR/UDAIPUR: Defence minister Rajnath Singh flagged on Friday the alarming trend of what he described as ""white-collar terrorism"", involving highly educated people engaging in antisocial and anti-national activities.Rajnath said the ""white-collar terror network"" behind the Nov 10 car blast in Delhi that killed 15 people illustrated the extent of the threat.

""But we are witnessing a worrying pattern of educated people being drawn into anti-national activities. This happens when education is divorced from dharma (righteousness) and character.""

Tribunal ruling mum on surplus flood waters, Andhra's projects cut into our share: Telangana

NEW DELHI: Disputes over sharing of river water among states is common, but India's newest state Telangana, while objecting to Andhra Pradesh's Polavaram-Banakacherla Link Project (PBLP), has raised an interesting question before the Supreme Court - can a state unilaterally attempt to utilise flood water on an inter-state river? Telangana said the project violates the binding award of Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal and would deprive the residents of Telangana their due share of Godavari water, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.Telangana said the tribunal award has not dealt with surplus flood waters and AP's projects, constituted in the guise of using flood water, would reduce the Godavari water share of Telangana.No mechanism exists in the country to determine whether a project utilises flood water or the assured share of water allocated to states by the award of a water disputes tribunal award, the A Revanth Reddy-led Congress govt said.Telangana said AP govt's decision to utilise more water through projects in the guise of harnessing excess flood water would have a chain reaction across the country. It said Karnataka intends to use more water of Krishna in the same manner which would accentuate water shortage for Telangana.""Maharashtra has also said that in case AP is allowed to plan projects based on flood waters, it would also like to plan projects on so-called flood waters.This would completely destabilise the utilisation pattern in the co-basin states violating the binding award of GWDT,"" it said.A bench led by CJI Surya Kant on Monday will hear a writ petition filed by Telangana govt which challenged the decision of the Central Water Commission (CWC) to grant consent to AP govt to prepare detailed project report for PBLP even though there had been no in-principle consent for project feasibility report (PFR), which must be obtained prior to preparation of DPR.The Polavaram project was to be executed on the Godavari river as per the Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal which was to carry 80 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) of water to the Krishna river through its canal system for use in the Krishna delta system.""Now, instead of approved diversion of 80 TMC of water to the Krishna river, AP govt is expanding infrastructure of the Polavaram project without any approvals to carry additional 200 TMC (intended to increase to 300 TMC later) of water to the Krishna river and beyond through Polavaram-Banakacherla Link Project/Polavaram- Nallamalasagar Link Project in the guise of carrying flood waters of the Godavari,"" it said.Accusing AP govt of undertaking expansion work for PBLP and PNLP prior to submission of pre-feasibility report to the CWC, Telangana govt said AP has floated tenders for undertaking work despite CWC specifically informing it to wait for approval of PFR.

Karnataka HC: Third parties can challenge lok adalat awards if fraud is alleged,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-hc-third-parties-can-challenge-lok-adalat-awards-if-fraud-is-alleged/articleshow/126315652.cms,"Karnataka HC

BENGALURU: Karnataka HC has held that even a third party can, depending on the facts of the case, challenge a lok adalat award through a writ petition if the award is alleged to have been secured fraudulently by excluding a proper and necessary party.The observation was made by Justice M Nagaprasanna while quashing a decree passed by a civil court in Hosapete, Vijayanagara district, arising from a compromise recorded before a lok adalat.The case is related to a land partition dispute in Kamalapur village. A compromise petition had been entered into before the lok adalat between Nagamma Nagalapura and the children of Karadantappa, both belonging to different branches of the family of Khemmani Hanumanthappa, the original owner of the properties. Guramma and her children, who also claimed to be part of the same family, were not arrayed as parties to the suit.Challenging the decree dated July 8, 2023, Guramma and her children contended that they were necessary parties and the compromise was entered into in collusion, with the intent of denying them their legitimate share in property. They had initially filed an appeal but withdrew it after being advised that an appeal was not maintainable against a decree drawn from a lok adalat compromise.They subsequently approached HC. Opposing the plea, the respondents argued that the writ petition was not maintainable as Guramma and her children were not parties to the original partition suit.After examining the records, provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, and earlier judgments, Justice Nagaprasanna held that in certain circumstances, a third party is entitled to invoke writ jurisdiction to challenge a lok adalat award if fraud is alleged on the grounds that the party was deliberately not impleaded despite being necessary to the proceedings.Allowing the petition, the court ordered restoration of the civil suit before Hosapete court. It also directed that any financial transactions carried out pursuant to the compromise should be deposited before the trial court, remaining subject to the final outcome of partition proceedings.","Karnataka hc quashes a decree passed by a civil court in hosapete, vijayanagara district.

A missed holiday can easily turn a routine bank visit into a wasted trip, especially in the first few days of the year when people are settling back into work and finances.Banks in India observe a mix of national and regional holidays, which means closure dates can differ from one state to another.Banks will remained closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Nagaland and Meghalaya on the occasion of New Year's Day and Gaan-Ngai.Banks will remain closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu in observance of New Year Celebrations and Mannam Jayanthi.Banks will remain closed in Uttar Pradesh for birthday of Hazrat Ali.Banks in West Bengal will remain closed in observance of birth day of Swami Vivekananda.Banks in Gujarat, Odisha, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh will be shut in on the occasion of Makar Sankranti and Magh Bihu.The states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh will remain closed for Uttarayana Punyakala, Pongal, Maghe Sankranti and Makara Sankranti.Banks in Tamil Nadu will be shut in observance of Thiruvalluvar Day.Banks in Tamil Nadu will remain closed due to Uzhavar Thirunal.Banks in Tripura, Odisha, West Bengal, will remain shut in observance of the birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed nationwide on the occasion of Republic day.Apart from these, banks also remain closed on every second and fourth Saturday of the month.Knowing bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute delays. However, bank closure does not means that customers can not process their financial transactions during holidays. Even when branches are shut, online banking services, ATMs, mobile banking apps and UPI for fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions are available for customers.However, services that require a physical visit, such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances and issuing demand drafts, will not be available. To avoid inconvenience, account holders are advised to plan these activities in advance and make the most of digital banking options during closures.","Banks will remained closed in mizoram, tamil nadu, sikkim, manipur, arunachal pradesh, west bengal, nagaland and meghalaya on the occasion of new year's day and gaan-ngai. Online banking services, atms, mobile banking apps and upi for fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions are available for customers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126282096,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1427185,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Rahul was visible, a little too much? A lookback at 2025

Mahatma Gandhi once envisioned a future where the Congress would quietly dissolve itself into a Lok Sevak Sangh after Independence, having fulfilled its role and returned power to the people. History, as it often does, chose drama instead. The party stayed on, grew older, heavier with legacy -- and now, at 140, finds itself older than independent India and still very much in the business of electoral survival.Founded in 1885, the Indian National Congress didn’t just witness the making of modern India; it scripted large parts of it. But fast-forward to the present, and the party that once defined the political centre is struggling to locate it. The slogans are loud, the marches long, the symbolism familiar—but dominance has been replaced by damage control, and nostalgia no longer guarantees votes.Now, stepping into its 141st year, the Congress has little time to blow out birthday candles and even less room to get things wrong. A series of assembly elections across five states is lining up as its next reality check, testing whether fresh campaign calls, revived alliances, and lessons from a bruising 2025 can finally add up.From rebranding protest politics to fighting key battles in the south and the northeast, the grand old party is once again at the crossroads -- older, wiser, and under pressure to prove it still knows the way forward.Save the Constitution, vote chori, caste survey -- these are some of the battle cries Congress tried to campaign on. Rahul Gandhi walked miles for it. While the leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha may have charmed those he walked with, the votes did not enter its account.2026, however, would see a break from these campaign calls as the Grand Old Party announced nationwide protests against the BJP-led central government for replacing the rural employment scheme - MGNREGA - with VB G-RAM-G law.""We also pledge to democratically oppose every conspiracy to remove Gandhiji's name from MNREGA,"" Mallikarjun Kharge said at the CWC meet as he announced the campaign from January 5.But the question is, would the people who need the scheme relate to ""conspiracy to remove Gandhiji's name from MNREGA""?While the CWC release does highlight what it describes as the systematic dilution of MNREGA, including unilateral changes to the scheme’s structure without consultation or parliamentary debate, the beneficiaries in whose name the Congress is mobilising are unlikely to engage with or prioritise such detailed party statements.Out of the five states that are set to see ballot contests this year, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry remain the crucial ones for Congress. The party will directly face the BJP or the Left in these assembly elections.The party is riding on high confidence with a sweeping comeback in the Kerala local body polls. However, the BJP-led NDA's Trivandrum win cannot be ignored.The local body election results offer the Congress-led UDF a clear strategic edge heading into the upcoming assembly polls. A pronounced anti-incumbency wave has cut through the LDF’s welfare and governance narrative, pushing the Left to its weakest grassroots position in years and denting its push for a third consecutive term.While the BJP’s expanding footprint has complicated Kerala’s traditional bipolar contest, the erosion of LDF dominance gives the UDF momentum, credibility, and a renewed claim as the principal alternative as the assembly battle approaches.After its 2016 defeat in Assam—driven by deep anti-incumbency, alliance consolidation by the BJP, and voter frustration over corruption, jobs, and governance—the Congress is recalibrating its approach. This time, the party is foregrounding a grassroots-first strategy through its “Raijor Podulit Raijor Congress” campaign, aimed at rebuilding credibility from the bottom up. By crowdsourcing inputs for its manifesto via thousands of “aspirational boxes” and sustained community outreach across regions, the Congress is seeking to address precisely the issues that cost it power earlier: employment, fair wages for tea workers, flood management, public health, and governance delivery.At the organisational level, the Congress is also positioning itself as the anchor of a broad opposition alliance to take on the BJP, while trying to avoid the fragmentation that helped its rivals in the past.However, the decision to contest 100 of 126 seats has exposed fault lines within the alliance, making seat-sharing and coordination a key test of leadership. Balancing assertiveness with accommodation, translating consultation into votes, and countering the BJP’s entrenched narrative on identity and development remain the party’s central challenges as it looks to convert renewed mobilisation into an electoral comeback in Assam.Congress finds itself walking a tightrope within the DMK-led alliance. While it wants to improve its bargaining position by pressing for a higher number of seats, the party has to contend with its relatively weak independent base in the state and the DMK’s clear upper hand.The party’s challenge lies in projecting relevance and cohesion without appearing disruptive, ensuring smooth coordination at the grassroots for vote transfer, and managing internal ambitions—all while avoiding strain in a long-standing alliance that remains crucial for its electoral survival in Tamil Nadu.Conflicting actions by individual leaders, including high-profile meetings outside the alliance framework, have added to doubts about unity and discipline, even if these are intended mainly to strengthen Congress’s hand in talks.Congress heads into the West Bengal polls facing an existential challenge shaped by years of steady decline and shrinking political space. From being a significant player with strongholds in Malda and Murshidabad a decade ago, the party has slipped into near irrelevance, drawing a blank in the 2021 assembly election and losing even its traditional bases.This collapse has coincided with the BJP’s rapid rise as the principal opposition to the Trinamool Congress, leaving Congress squeezed out of the bipolar contest. Compounding the problem is Mamata Banerjee’s clear insistence on going it alone, shutting the door on any meaningful alliance and reducing Congress’s bargaining power to zero.With no dominant leader, weak organisation, and little clarity on whether it is fighting for seats, vote share or mere visibility, Congress enters the 2026 battle not just struggling to regain relevance, but fighting to remain a credible political force in Bengal at all.The recent remarks from within and around the Congress have given fresh momentum to the question of whether the party is informally sounding out Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as a larger leadership option amid its ongoing churn.The letter by former Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim, questioning Mallikarjun Kharge’s effectiveness and explicitly citing age and youth disconnect, reflects a deeper anxiety within sections of the party about stagnation and electoral drift.Endorsements of Priyanka—ranging from Imran Masood’s projection of her as a prime ministerial face to Robert Vadra’s acknowledgement of growing demands—suggest an undercurrent that sees her as a potential unifying figure who could reconnect the party with voters.Rather than a clear leadership challenge, the episode points to a Congress struggling to balance generational renewal, organisational reform and its continued reliance on the Gandhi family, with Priyanka emerging less as a declared alternative and more as a symbol of unresolved succession questions.2025 was a year of motion without payoff for the Congress. Rahul Gandhi’s 1,300-kilometre march through Bihar—spanning 25 districts and 110 seats—came loaded with slogans, symbolism, and carefully curated local flavour. From gamchas and Bhojpuri soundbites to makhana and motorbike rides, the outreach was exhaustive. The results were not. Voters showed up, but they did not line up behind the Congress, leaving the party staring at one of its weakest performances in the state and once again exposing the gap between optics and organisation.That disconnect played out across the electoral map. The promise of 2024’s Lok Sabha showing evaporated in the 2025 Assembly elections in Haryana, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Delhi. Haryana slipped away amid factional squabbles and the absence of a decisive state leader.Maharashtra saw alliance fatigue within the MVA blunt Congress’s impact. In Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the BJP’s machine, backed by Narendra Modi’s enduring pull, steamrolled Congress campaigns. Delhi remained a write-off. Jharkhand stood apart, where the Congress survived by riding on the back of a strong JMM alliance and a welfare-driven pitch—less a revival than a reminder of where the party still works.Rahul Gandhi ensured the Congress never vanished from the headlines, sharpening his attacks with claims of “vote chori” and warnings of systemic voter fraud. The rhetoric kept the narrative alive, but elections are won on the ground, not in press conferences. By the end of 2025, the verdict was hard to miss: the Congress can still set the conversation, but without organisational discipline and credible state leadership, it continues to lose the contest.","The indian national congress has little time to blow out birthday candles and even less room to get things wrong.

NEW DELHI: Getting into the Yuletide spirit could prove expensive for an Air India pilot who was to operate a Vancouver-Delhi (via Vienna) flight on Dec 23, 2025. A staffer at Vancouver duty free either saw him inadvertently sipping wine being offered at this festive time or found him smelling of liquor while he was buying a bottle. She reported this Boeing 777 pilot to the Canadian authorities who conducted a breath analyser test on him which he flunked and then he was detained.Luckily for passengers, Air India managed to quickly find a replacement. The ultra long haul, to be operated by four pilots or two sets (one captain and a co-pilot in each set) in turns, supposed to leave at 3 pm local time did so with just a two-hour delay. The aircraft then landed in Vienna from where another set of crew operated it to Delhi.“AI has taken a very stern view of this matter. The pilot was flown to Delhi a couple of days later and is being probed. The issue has been reported to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), which is also examining the same,” said people in the know.While some sources say the pilot had inadvertently sipped an alcoholic drink at the airport and a staffer at duty free saw him doing so, others said he smelled of alcohol when buying a bottle.It is not yet known which of the two really happened, staffer reported the matter to Canadian authorities who then used CCTV footage to find out the pilot in question was to operate with flight. They managed to trace him to the AI aircraft.In a statement, AI said: “AI 186 from Vancouver to Delhi on Dec 23, 2025, experienced a last-minute delay after one of the cockpit crew members was offloaded prior to departure. Canadian authorities raised concerns regarding the pilot’s fitness for duty, following which the crew member was taken for further inquiry. In accordance with safety protocols, an alternate pilot was rostered to operate the flight, resulting in the delay. ”""Air India regrets the inconvenience caused to its passengers and is fully cooperating with the local authorities. The pilot has been taken off flying duties during the process of enquiry. Air India maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any violation of applicable rules and regulations. Pending the outcome of the investigation, any confirmed violation will attract strict disciplinary action in line with company policy. Safety remains Air India’s highest priority at all times,” the airline statement added.Pilots operating international sectors usually do not have pre-flight breath analyser (BA) tests and the same is conducted on arrival as liquor is available on board these flights. This is to ensure they have not taken a sip or two during the flight. On domestic flights, pre-flights BA tests are conducted as alcohol is not served/sold on flights within India.While rules don’t mandate this, AI on its own has enforced a policy of conducting random pre-flight BA at international stations. The airline frequently keeps sending its doctors on international flights who then conduct these checks on pilots who are to operate the return flight to India.Pilots are surprised at this case. ""Forget drinking, we don’t even use after shaves, perfumes, mouth wash or homeopathic medicines some hours before operating a flight. There have been multiple instances of teetotallers failing BA tests because of the alcohol in their breath because of using toiletries with alcoholic content. We look for these items without any alcohol, except homeopathic medicines where possibly there’s no option,” said a captain. The reason: Failing BA test thrice means losing flying license.","A staffer at vancouver duty free either saw him inadvertently sipping wine being offered at this festive time or found him smelling of liquor while he was buying a bottle.

BARUIPUR: ""I will make three ghosts walk,"" said Trinamool Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee as he ushered in three people on stage - two men from Metiabruz in Kolkata and a woman from Kakdwip in South 24 Parganas - who he said had been marked dead during the SIR of Bengal's voter rolls.Flagging off Trinamool's campaign for the 2026 assembly election with a rally in Baruipur on Friday, Abhishek made it clear that SIR would be the front-and-centre of the party's poll pitch.Abhishek said, ""The day before yesterday, we visited the EC's office in Delhi.

SRINAGAR: J&K Police have initiated action against more than 100 people, including teenagers, for violating prohibitory orders on the use of Virtual Private Network (VPN) services.Cops Friday conducted a district-wide verification drive in south Kashmir’s Shopian, during which 15 people were identified using VPN services. According to police, detailed technical scrutiny and background verification did not reveal any terror-related links or adverse antecedents, so no FIR was registered in the matter.“However, as a preventive measure, security proceedings were initiated against 10 individuals, primarily belonging to the younger age group, for violation of the said orders,” a cop said. Under these security measures, they were warned to refrain from using VPN services in the future. “Out of the 15 individuals identified, five were minors who were counselled and advised in the presence of their guardians, with emphasis on awareness, lawful digital conduct, and the consequences of violating lawful orders,” he added.In south Kashmir’s Kulgam and Pulwama districts, cops have identified 101 people who used VPN services in violation of prohibitory orders.In Kulgam, police said security proceedings have been initiated against six persons. In Pulwama, 95 people were identified using VPN, but technical scrutiny of their devices and background verification found no terror-related links or adverse antecedents, so no FIR was registered. However, as a preventive measure, security proceedings have been initiated against 43 individuals, primarily in the 18–40 age group, for violating prohibitory orders.Earlier this week, police imposed a phased ban on VPN services across several districts in Kashmir Valley, issuing district-wise orders. VPN use was prohibited in Srinagar, Ganderbal, Kupwara, Shopian, Budgam, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag, citing threats to national security and the possibility of their misuse to incite unrest.Following the imposition of restrictions, police have begun acting against violators. “How can I watch my favourite Irish and UK shows now? Is it only banned for illegal activity? I'm sure that The Graham Norton Show is not dodgy!” wrote a Facebook user in Srinagar in response.","Cops friday conducted a district-wide verification drive in south kashmir’s shopian, during which 15 people were identified using vpn services.

"‘Abhishek following path shown by Rahul’: Congress, Trinamool spar over credit for exposing ‘vote chori’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/abhishek-following-path-shown-by-rahul-congress-trinamool-spar-over-credit-for-exposing-vote-chori/articleshow/126309930.cms,"BJP Claims Rahul Gandhi Ties To ‘Anti-India’ Panel Over US Lawmakers' Umar Khalid Letter

NEW DELHI: The high-decibel “vote chori” campaign led by Rahul Gandhi , which had united the opposition cutting across party lines last year, now seems to have created a divide between them. This, after Trinamool Congress leader Abhishek Banerjee claimed that the Congress and some other regional parties had failed to understand how the game of “vote chori” was happening through the process of Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls under the watch of the Election Commission .The Trinamool leader also questioned the approach of these parties as he asserted that the “fight against vote chori was on the ground at the booth level and not on social media and TV channels.”The Congress reacted sharply to his remarks. And the charge was led by West Bengal leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who has been one of the strongest critics of Mamata’s Trinamool Congress. Adhir accused Abhishek, who is the nephew of Mamata Banerjee, of following Rahul Gandhi by walking on the path shown by the former Congress president to take credit.“Everyone in India and even across the world knows that it is Rahul Gandhi who had exposed ""vote chori” in elections and attacked the Election Commission and it was his sustained campaign that even forced the Supreme Court to intervene at least five times in the process of SIR. This nephew of Bengal is now trying to copy the agenda of Rahul Gandhi and take credit,” Adhir said, attacking Mamata’s nephew.Chowdhury, who is a former West Bengal Congress president, also alleged that Mamata’s nephew always attacked and abused the Congress while not saying anything against the BJP.""When he was called for questioning by the ED, he came out and attacked the Congress, not the ED or the BJP. Now, he went to the ECI office, and then, as he stepped out, he again abused the Congress. Let people see for themselves who he is working for. He doesn't say a single word against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),"" Adhir said.Congress’s reaction came after Abhishek Banerjee claimed that “vote chori” was happening through the electoral rolls and not the EVMs.“Vote chori is happening in voter lists through the electoral rolls and not in the EVMs.If the Congress and other parties could have caught this game, the BJP would have lost all the states it won last year. Such high strike rates of BJP in so many states were not a coincidence. Congress, AAP, RJD could not understand the game,” claimed Abhishek Banerjee.He claimed that opposition parties are failing to understand what ""algorithms and software are being run to disenfranchise and remove 50 lakh to 1 crore voters"" and said if this is not happening, the ""poll panel should release a list of 1.36 crore logical discrepancies.""Abhishek also went on to question the approach of these parties in highlighting the “vote chori” allegations. “Those who think that elections can be won by making a few strong remarks on TV channels have got it wrong. The fight is on the ground and you have to fight at the booth level to prevent it,” he said.Clearly, this was a strong message to the Congress, especially Rahul Gandhi, who was the first to make “vote chori” allegations and tried very hard to make it an election issue in Bihar, but failed.Led by Abhishek, the Trinamool Congress has unleashed an all-out offensive against the Election Commission. The Trinamool leader has locked horns with CEC Gyanesh Kumar over the process of SIR and has asserted that his party will not accept the electoral roll if the discrepancies are not removed.“Our position is unambiguous and non-negotiable: The entire list of voters branded under the vague and arbitrary label of 'Logical Discrepancy' must be published immediately, with clear Assembly-constituency-wise and category-wise break-ups. The criteria, methodology, and legal authority used to create this category must be placed in the public domain without delay,” the Trinamool has said after a heated meeting with the Election Commission on Wednesday.","Abhishek banerjee claimed that the congress and some other regional parties had failed to understand how the game of ""vote chori"" was happening.

Cleanest City Hit By Water Contamination As Lab Links Indore Diarrhoea Outbreak To Pipeline Leak

NEW DELHI: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Mohan Yadav on Friday announced strict action against senior civic officials over the contaminated drinking water incident in Indore’s Bhagirathpura area, saying negligence would not be tolerated.In a post on X late Friday, the chief minister said Rohit Sisonia, additional commissioner of the Indore Municipal Corporation, and Sanjeev Srivastava, executive engineer in charge of the public health engineering (PHE) department, had been suspended.He also said instructions had been issued to remove Dilip Kumar Yadav, the commissioner of the Indore Municipal Corporation.“The state government will not tolerate negligence in the incident caused by contaminated drinking water in Bhagirathpura, Indore. Strict decisions are being taken in this regard,” Yadav said in his post.The chief minister had earlier ordered disciplinary action following an outbreak of diarrhoea and vomiting linked to contaminated water in the area.The outbreak has affected more than 1,400 people over the past nine days. While local residents have claimed that 15 people, including a six-month-old baby, died, the health department has confirmed four deaths so far, news agency PTI reported.Yadav reviewed the situation with the chief secretary and senior officials and directed that show-cause notices be issued to the municipal commissioner and additional commissioner.He also ordered the immediate transfer of the additional commissioner from Indore and the withdrawal of water distribution responsibilities from the in-charge superintending engineer.Laboratory tests have confirmed that the outbreak was caused by contaminated drinking water, PTI reported, citing officials.A leakage was found in a main water supply pipeline near a police outpost in Bhagirathpura, at a spot over which a toilet had been constructed, leading to contamination.Officials said clean water supply has since been restored after repairs, though residents have been advised to boil water as a precaution.The state government has also directed officials to prepare a time-bound plan to prevent similar incidents elsewhere in Madhya Pradesh.","Madhya pradesh chief minister mohan yadav announces strict action against senior civic officials.

A tiger appeared without warning, gliding like a shadow along the forest edge as a boat drifted through the Periyar waters. For a 13-year-old boy visiting Kerala in 1957, the moment was electrifying. Wildlife then was not something confined to sanctuaries; it was visible, immediate, woven into everyday landscapes. That fleeting encounter stayed with Romulus Whitaker long before he became one of India's most influential conservationists, shaping a life devoted to understanding-and defending-creatures most people feared.Whitaker's first journey to Kerala was part of a family trip. His sister was graduating from high school, and the itinerary included Kochi, where they stayed at the Malabar Hotel, then considered the city's finest. Boat rides through rivers like the Periyar were already popular, and wildlife sightings were common. ""Gaurs and deer were easily spotted, and tigers still roamed freely at a time when hunting was legal. I never saw a king cobra on that trip, but the habit of looking closely had already taken root,"" Whitaker recalls.That fascination had formed much earlier, far from India. Growing up in northern New York State, Whitaker once watched neighbourhood boys kill a snake out of fear.""I knew more about snakes than the other kids, and that made a difference,"" he says. His mother encouraged his curiosity, buying him a book on snakes that helped replace fear with knowledge. When he later brought a live snake home, she admired it rather than panicking, calling it beautiful. An old aquarium with cracked glass became a makeshift enclosure. Without realizing it, Whitaker had taken his first step into a lifelong engagement with reptiles-a fascination that deepened after his family moved to India in the 1950s.Janaki Lenin, Whitaker's partner and co-author of his autobiography ""Snakes, Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll: My Early Years"", says writing the book gave her a deeper understanding of the extraordinary life he has lived. His schooling, she notes, was anything but conventional-camping in forests, fishing in lakes, and once even discovering a python under his bed. Boredom was never an option. If a classroom failed to hold his attention, he simply walked away to explore something more compelling outdoors. Comparing his life to her own, Lenin describes Whitaker as someone who has ""lived six or seven lifetimes in one.""Formal education never quite suited him. After finishing school, Whitaker enrolled in college but soon realized classrooms could not compete with hands-on learning. His real education began at the Miami Serpentarium under Bill Haast, the legendary snake handler who pioneered venom extraction in the United States. Working alongside Haast, Whitaker learned to handle venomous snakes, maintain them in captivity, and extract venom for medical use. ""Bill Haast was my guru,"" he says. ""He taught me respect for snakes, not just technique.""When Whitaker returned to India, he had a clear idea: The country needed a place where people could learn about snakes scientifically rather than fear them blindly. That idea took shape in 1969 with the opening of the Madras Snake Park. Visitors arrived sceptical-some expecting spectacle, others danger. Whitaker himself was often viewed as an eccentric outsider. But the park was never meant to entertain. It was an educational experiment. For the first time, ordinary people could see snakes up close, learn to identify species, and understand that most snakes were not out to harm them.Over the decades, the impact has been profound. India today has thousands of snake rescuers, a reality Whitaker views with cautious optimism. While rescue work has reduced routine killings, it has also become performative in some cases. Kerala, he notes, stands out for institutionalizing rescue work. By registering rescuers, issuing identity cards, and maintaining an online database, the state has created a system rooted in accountability and data. The model has since been adopted by Karnataka and is being replicated in Tamil Nadu Snakebite, however, remains one of India's most under-recognized public health crises. For decades, official statistics claimed around 1,400 deaths annually. A nationwide ""Million Deaths Study"" based on verbal autopsies revealed a far grimmer reality: Over 50,000 deaths every year, with nearly one million snakebite incidents. Many victims never reach hospitals, either dying en route or seeking traditional remedies instead of medical treatment.""The key word is prevention,"" Whitaker says. Simple measures-using a torch at night, wearing footwear, being cautious near pump houses-could prevent a significant proportion of bites. Improved reporting, he adds, has made it seem as though cases are increasing, when in fact awareness and documentation have improved. Treating snakebite as a medical emergency rather than a cultural or mystical phenomenon remains the biggest challenge.Few initiatives illustrate Whitaker's belief in practical, science-based solutions better than his long association with the Irula tribal community of Tamil Nadu. For generations, the Irulas survived by catching snakes for their skins. When the skin trade was banned, their livelihood vanished overnight. Working with the community, Whitaker helped develop a new model: Irula snake catchers would capture snakes, extract venom under controlled conditions, and release them back into the wild. The venom would then be supplied to pharmaceutical companies to manufacture antivenom.""They are saving lakhs of human lives,"" Whitaker says. Today, around 350 Irula families supply venom that meets India's entire antivenom requirement. For him, it remains the country's only true example of sustainable wildlife use-one that benefits both people and animals without depleting wild populations.Human-animal conflict remains one of conservation's most complex challenges. India's tiger, leopard, and crocodile populations have all increased-a remarkable achievement by global standards. But many of these animals now live outside protected forests. Leopards, in particular, thrive in agricultural landscapes, raising cubs in sugarcane fields and feeding on small animals and stray dogs. ""Leopards don't need forests the way we think they do,"" Whitaker explains. ""They've adapted to living alongside people.""Problems arise when human panic leads to capture and relocation-an intervention that often worsens conflict. Whitaker's own experience reinforced this lesson. Living on a small farm near Chennai, he once lost a dog to a leopard. His first instinct was to call the forest department. Then came the realisation: ""We moved into his territory. He didn't move into ours."" Simple precautions, like keeping dogs indoors at night, resolved the issue without endangering the cat.Lenin agrees that human-wildlife conflict is not new, but says its nature has changed. Earlier, communities managed interactions locally. ""The law took away that freedom, but the state did not fulfil its responsibility of sorting out the issue,"" she says. Many conflicts today, she argues, are effectively state-created-especially in the case of elephants, which require vast landscapes and abundant food. Habitat disruption leaves marginalized communities bearing the burden of coexistence, even though they are the least equipped to do so.Whitaker is critical of how crop-raiding wildlife is managed, particularly in Kerala, one of the few states where wild boars that devastate farmlands are legally permitted to be killed but must then be buried. Recalling ecologist Madhav Gadgil's public criticism of the policy, Whitaker questions the logic of wasting what is a valuable protein source. ""These animals can destroy paddy or peanut fields as much as an elephant does, but after killing them, you are told to bury the meat. People are always in need of protein, especially in rural areas. He recounts seeing electric fences in parts of north India where nilgai, jackals, and peacocks were killed indiscriminately and left to rot. For him, science-based preventive infrastructure works far better than reactionary measures.He regards Indira Gandhi as India's most conservation-minded Prime Minister, instrumental in legislations such as the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. ""She had come to the Snake Park in Madras in 1972, and then we told her about the problems that were happening. When Rajiv became the prime minister, we spoke to him about the Andamans and the deforestation there, and they stopped it. These were the times when you could actually speak to a prime minister and the next day you might see some action; I would love to see that happening today. ""When Whitaker received the Padma Shri, he briefly met Prime Minister Narendra Modi but did not get the chance to speak at length. He later sent a draft message to the PM's office, hoping for a mention of snakebite prevention during Mann Ki Baat. ""If the PM spoke for even one minute about snakebite as a medical emergency, and about the importance of govt hospitals being equipped to handle it, thousands of lives could be saved,"" he says.When he first documented India's snakes, around 275 species were known. Today, more than 360 have been recorded. For young people entering herpetology, he sees unprecedented opportunities through universities and research institutions.""Go there, volunteer, and learn,"" he advises. ""Observe, respect, and don't try to be a hero. Conservation is about patience and understanding, not spectacle.""Now in his eighties, Whitaker continues to focus on snakebite mitigation through films and awareness campaigns. From a child defending a snake to a man who has spent a lifetime persuading a nation to rethink its fears, his story is ultimately about understanding nature and choosing scientific knowledge over fear.(Romulus Whitaker was in Kochi with his partner, writer Janaki Lenin, for the Blue & Green Climate LitFest 2025 organized by Climate Action Today & Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies)",Romulus whitaker is one of india's most influential conservationists.

"Indore water contamination row: 10 dead, over 1,000 affected; reports flag 'presence of bacteria' - key findings",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indore-water-contamination-row-10-dead-over-1000-affected-reports-flag-presence-of-bacteria-key-findings/articleshow/126302719.cms,"Cleanest City Hit By Water Contamination As Lab Links Indore Diarrhoea Outbreak To Pipeline Leak

What we know so far

Residents of the Bhagirathpura began reporting to hospitals across the city from Monday onwards, complaining of vomiting, high fever and diarrhoea.

Officials said the contamination occurred after sewage water from a toilet constructed at a local police check post seeped into the drinking water line.

After the outbreak, laboratory tests confirmed that the diarrhoea outbreak was caused by contaminated drinking water.

According to Indore's chief medical and health officer Dr Madhav Prasad Hasani, the report was prepared by city-based medical college.

It claimed that the water collected from Bhagirathpura were contaminated due to a leak in a main supply pipeline.

However, officials were yet to identify the specific bacteria responsible.

Madhya Pradesh CM Mohan Yadav issued a statement saying, ""Following the stern action taken against the responsible officials in connection with the tragic incident caused by the supply of contaminated drinking water in Indore, we are also taking corrective measures for other places in the state. For this purpose, instructions have been given to the concerned officials to prepare time-bound programs. In this regard, a virtual meeting of the mayors, chairpersons, and commissioners of all 16 municipal corporations, along with district collectors, officials from the health department, urban development department, public health engineering department, and other relevant headquarters-level officials, has been convened this evening. In this meeting, a review of the entire state will be conducted, and necessary instructions will be issued.""



The CM had also issued directions to get the Additional Commissioner from Indore, and to relieve the In-Charge Superintending Engineer. ""This morning, I reviewed the actions being taken by the state government in the Indore contaminated drinking water case with the Chief Secretary and other officials, and issued necessary directions. I also discussed the report presented by the Additional Chief Secretary (Urban Administration and Development).I issued directions to the Indore Municipal Corporation Commissioner and Additional Commissioner to issue a charge sheet notice in this regard, to immediately remove the Additional Commissioner from Indore, and to relieve the In-Charge Superintending Engineer of the duties of the Water Distribution Works Department. I also issued directions to fill the necessary posts in the Indore Municipal Corporation with immediate effect,"" said the CM.

Bhagirathpura, meanwhile, remains largely deserted. With more than 200 residents admitted to 27 hospitals across Indore, most families have been away attending to sick relatives.

After repairs and inspection, clean water was restored through the pipeline on Thursday. However, residents have been advised to boil water before consumption as a precaution.

Meanwhile, residents of Indore's Bhagirathpura area remain afraid of consuming even the tanker-supplied water following a contaminated drinking water incident that left several people ill and claimed lives.

Despite assurances from the municipal corporation and the deployment of water tankers, locals said that they didn't have trust in the water supply system.

""We had been complaining about dirty water for several days, but no one was listening and several people were falling ill. My daughter, Kanak Lashkari (15), is currently admitted to the Arvindo hospital. My mother, aged 93, fell ill on December 24, but after treatment she has now recovered. We are now buying water for drinking, and for other uses, we rely on government boring water. The municipal corporation is supplying drinking water via tankers, but we are afraid to consume it. We no longer have trust in this supply. This is destruction being carried out in the name of development,"" a local resident said.

Earlier, Madhya Pradesh Urban Development and Housing Minister Kailash Vijayvargiya stressed that micro-checking in the entire colony is in progress and will be completed in 8-10 days. ""There were possibilities of contamination of water with sewage; therefore, treatment had already begun earlier, and the same treatment continues now. Micro-checking is underway across the entire colony and will take 8 to 10 days..."", he said.

NEW DELHI: At least 10 people have died while more the 1,400 are affected due to a diarrhoea outbreak caused by contaminated water in Bhagirathpura area of Madhya Pradesh's Indore.“According to health department data, four people have died due to the diarrhea outbreak in Bhagirathpura. However, I have received information about 10 deaths due to this outbreak,” Indore Mayor Pushyamitra Bhargava told PTI.Madhya Pradesh CM also issued a statement assuring action and ordering removal of Additional Commissioner from Indore, and In-Charge Superintending Engineer from duties.This comes after – according to officials – a leakage was found in the main drinking water supply pipeline near a police outpost in Bhagirathpura, at a spot over which a toilet has been constructed. They claimed the leakage led to contamination of the water supply.According to locals, one of the victims, who was just six-month-old, died after he fell sick due to alleged consumption of contaminated water.According to the family, the child fell ill with diarrhoea on December 26 and was taken to a local doctor, who prescribed medication. The family brought the child back home after check-up, but on December 29, the infant suffered a high fever and died at home.",Lab tests confirm that diarrhoea outbreak was caused by contaminated drinking water.
