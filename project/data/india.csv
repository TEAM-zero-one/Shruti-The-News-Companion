NEW DELHI: CBI will challenge the suspension of life sentence and bail to former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in the Unnao rape case in the Supreme Court, officials said.It was decided to file an SLP before the SC at the earliest against the orders of the Delhi HC, which granted bail to Sengar after suspending his life sentence, a CBI spokesperson said. Sengar, however, will remain in jail as he is also serving a 10-year term for the custodial death of the rape survivor's father. TNN & AgenciesSengar was convicted for kidnapping and raping the girl in 2017, when she was a minor. He had filed an appeal against his life sentence, which was vehemently opposed by the CBI and the family of the victim before the high court.""The CBI filed timely replies and written arguments in this matter. The CBI will immediately challenge this order,"" the statement said. The Delhi high court on Tuesday suspended the jail term of expelled BJP leader Sengar, who was serving life imprisonment in the 2017 Unnao rape case, saying he has already served seven years and five months in prison.Sengar's sentence has been suspended by the HC till the pendency of his appeal challenging his conviction and sentence in the rape case.He has challenged a December 2019 trial court verdict in the case.Imposing several conditions for bail, the bench of Justices Subramonium Prasad and Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar directed Sengar to furnish a personal bond of Rs 15 lakh with three sureties of the like amount.It also directed him not to come within a 5-km radius of the victim's residence in Delhi, and not issue threats to her or her mother.","Cbi will challenge the suspension of life sentence and bail to former bjp mla kuldeep singh sengar in the unnao rape case in the supreme court.

Trial court erred: Allahabad high court; man freed after 24 years in jail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trial-court-erred-allahabad-high-court-man-freed-after-24-years-in-jail/articleshow/126168987.cms,"Representative image

PRAYAGRAJ: Noting that the trial court failed to notice that the appellant was confessing to a crime out of fear for his life, the Allahabad high court has overturned the conviction of a man who spent almost 24 years in prison after being sentenced to life imprisonment in a dacoity case.The trial court had in 2002 delivered its verdict based solely on his admission in his statements recorded under CrPC Section 313. A division bench of Justice JJ Munir and Justice Sanjiv Kumar found fault with the trial judge for failing to notice that the appellant was confessing out of fear for his life.The high court concluded that the trial court erred in convicting the appellant as the prosecution had failed to connect him with the offence. Consequently, the court allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction and sentence, and acquitted Azad Khan of all charges. He is to be released forthwith from Mainpuri jail, the high court directed.The division bench ruled in its Dec 19 order that a conviction cannot be premised solely on an admission made in a statement under CrPC Sec 313, especially when the prosecution fails to adduce any corroborative or incriminating evidence.The court termed the incarceration of Azad Khan for almost 24 years as the sad part of the matter, noting that his so-called admission of guilt was likely driven by fear for his life rather than being a genuine confession.The Allahabad high court also noted that the appellant had no assistance of an advocate to defend himself and was not offered or provided any legal aid, which violated the right to a fair trial guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution (right to life and personal liberty) and also constituted a violation of CrPC Sec 304, which mandates legal aid, at the state's expense, for the accused.In Feb 2002, the appellant was convicted under ICP Secs 395 (dacoity) and 397 (robbery or dacoity, with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt) by the special judge (DAA)/additional sessions judge, Mainpuri.","Azad khan spent almost 24 years in prison after being sentenced to life imprisonment in a dacoity case.

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court has acquitted a father sentenced to death by a Surat trial court for the rape and murder of his pregnant teenage daughter, citing procedural lapses for refusing to accept the DNA report that led to his conviction as “credible evidence”.The case involves a 14-year-old migrant girl from Odisha whose body was found on Surat’s Dumas beach on June 29, 2017. An autopsy revealed she was pregnant and had been strangled to death. After her father’s arrest based on circumstantial evidence, the prosecution relied on DNA matching of the foetus and the accused to build what became the “cornerstone” of his Jan 2020 conviction under IPC and the Pocso Act.The case was turned on its head when the state govt sought the high court’s confirmation of the death sentence. “The prosecution failed to prove all necessary circumstances by reliable and clinching evidence, which would constitute a complete chain without a snap, as would permit a conclusion other than the one of the guilt of the accused,” the division bench of Justices Ilesh Vora and R T Vachhani said.The judges ruled that DNA samples of the victim’s unborn baby and the accused may have been “compromised” due to multiple lapses, including a 13-day delay in submitting these to the designated forensic laboratory and failure to preserve highly sensitive biological material in an ice box.","The case involves a 14-year-old migrant girl from odisha whose body was found on surat’s dumas beach on june 29, 2017.

MADURAI: A Pocso court in Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, on Wednesday convicted and sentenced a man to death for sexually assaulting and impregnating his minor daughter.The 49-year-old labourer, an alcoholic, repeatedly sexually assaulted his 14-year-old daughter since Aug 2024. He also threatened the survivor with dire consequences if she revealed the crime to her mother. When she fell ill, her mother took her to primary health centre where doctors found she was pregnant. Upon discovering that her husband had sexually assaulted their daughter, the woman lodged a complaint with an all-women police station in Feb 2025. Police registered a case for offences under the Pocso Act and arrested the accused.Special court judge K Suresh Kumar observed that the harm caused, deliberate misuse of authority, threats, and long-term impact on the survivor demonstrated the extreme seriousness of the offence. Acts committed by those in positions of trust, especially within families, require a strong response to maintain public confidence and protect other children, the judge said.","A pocso court in tirunelveli, tamil nadu, on wednesday convicted and sentenced a man to death for sexually assaulting and impregnating his minor daughter.

Consensual relation with student is not sex harassment: Allahabad high court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/consensual-relation-with-student-is-not-sex-harassment-allahabad-high-court/articleshow/126168950.cms,"Representative image

PRAYAGRAJ: A teacher being in a consensual relationship with his student amounts to misconduct but not sexual harassment, Allahabad high court has ruled, setting aside a 19-year-old dismissal order of a lecturer of Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT), Prayagraj.Allowing a writ petition filed by the sacked lecturer, Justice Saurabh Shyam Shamshery, in his Dec 16 order, observed that while the petitioner may not have adhered to the high moral standards expected of a teacher, the extreme penalty of dismissal imposed on him in 2006 was shockingly disproportionate.The petitioner was appointed lecturer with the department of computer science and engineering in 1999. The institute took disciplinary action against him following a complaint lodged in 2003 by a former student, who had completed her master’s course in 2000. In her complaint, the student alleged emotional and physical harassment, and claimed that the lecturer had forced a physical relationship upon her during her student years. The complaint was filed three years after she left the institute and after the teacher’s engagement to another woman.A five-member committee constituted by MNNIT expressed reservations about adjudicating allegations of rape. Subsequently, a one-man inquiry commission headed by a retired judge was appointed.The petitioner admitted to having a relationship with the complainant, but maintained it was consensual and continued after she left the institute. On the basis of the report, the institute terminated his services on Feb 28, 2006.Challenging the termination, the lecturer contended that the disciplinary proceedings were vitiated by violation of principles of natural justice, particularly denial of the right to cross-examine witnesses. MNNIT authorities argued that a teacher occupies a position of trust and authority, and any intimate relationship with a student amounts to serious misconduct.The HC observed that the relationship appeared to be consensual and was not followed by any criminal action. It noted that the complaint appeared to have been triggered by the failure of a proposed marriage between the parties due to religious differences and parental opposition.","Allahabad high court sets aside a 19-year-old dismissal order of a lecturer of motilal nehru national institute of technology (mnnit), prayagraj.

Vande Bharat Sleeper Train: Ready for New Year Launch from Bengaluru,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/made-in-bengaluru-vande-bharat-sleeper-set-for-new-year-rollout/articleshow/126126743.cms,"Made in Bengaluru: Vande Bharat Sleeper set for New Year rollout?

Is Vande Bharat sleeper better than Rajdhani Express?

BENGALURU: India's first semi-high-speed sleeper train, Vande Bharat Sleeper, is getting closer to its rollout. Manufactured in Bengaluru by Bharat Earth Movers Ltd (BEML), the train's second rake was recently dispatched to Indian Railways Contrary to speculations, the rake is still in Bengaluru and arrived at SMVT railway station Monday morning. A senior official from Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Chennai stated, ""The second rake of Vande Bharat Sleeper has come out of BEML and is still at SMVT station. It will likely remain there for another two or three days.""Vande Bharat Sleeper is designed for long-distance journeys exceeding 800–1,000km. Like the existing chair-car versions, this variant is engineered for a potential speed of 160 km/h, with quick acceleration and deceleration. However, the actual running speed will depend on the track infrastructure available on the route, as only a small portion of India's rail network can support speeds above 150 km/h.The rake spotted in Bengaluru consists of 16 coaches divided into three categories: third A/C, second A/C, and first A/C, similar to other air-conditioned rakes. Although the route for the initial commercial service has yet to be confirmed, it will be operated by Northern Railway zone which covers key cities such as Delhi, Ambala, Moradabad, Kanpur, Jaipur, and Jodhpur, across Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Jammu & Kashmir.As this rake is the first of its kind, there are some minor issues to resolve before clearance is granted. While the possibility of another trial run has not been ruled out, a decision has not yet been made. Eight more are planned, with a deadline set for March 2026. This initial batch of 10 rakes will be adequate to operate five sleeper services.Officials have acknowledged that minor technical modifications will be made in future rakes. ""We are identifying some minor rectification work, but we will implement that in the next rake. There are no issues with the aesthetics or design; the first two rakes are ready to operate without problems.""Once all formalities are complete, the rake will be transferred to Northern Railway. While Railway Board has yet to announce the details of the first commercial service, officials believe it might serve as a ‘New Year gift', with serious planning already under way.","India's first semi-high-speed sleeper train, vande bharat sleeper, is getting closer to its rollout.

The significantly higher bid has intensified concerns over the project's financial viability and long-term burden on citizens.Responding to these concerns, deputy chief minister and Bengaluru development minister DK Shivakumar said the govt's financial commitment will be capped at 40% of the project cost as estimated by the state. ""Beyond that, investment has to be made by private players. That is why the project is being taken up on build-operate-transfer basis,"" he said.He said he had reviewed Metro projects undertaken by BMRCL and tunnel projects in Mumbai, where costs are around Rs 1,200 crore per km. ""What has been quoted for this project will have to be examined,"" the DCM said.The project was tendered in two packages. Sources in Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA) said Adani Group's bid overshoots the govt estimate by 24% for package 1 and 28% for package 2, gaps that are likely to require cabinet-level scrutiny before any award decision is made.The Hyderabad-based Vishwa Samudra Engineering Ltd was the only other firm to qualify for the financial bidding stage. Of the four firms that initially submitted bids, Dilip Buildcon was disqualified under a tender clause barring companies with a history of bridge, flyover or tunnel collapses, while Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd withdrew after its joint venture partner failed to meet technical eligibility criteria.The opposition BJP has demanded that the govt drop the tunnel project. BJP MP from Bengaluru Central PC Mohan cautioned that major tunnelling firms had stayed away from the tender, highlighting a poor risk–reward balance under the BOT model, where private concessionaires fund 60% of the cost and recover their investment through tolls. Mohan also pointed to limited soil testing and traffic data as factors that could drive further cost escalation once construction begins.Mobility experts who have been critical of the project said the Rs 22,267-crore cost quoted could eventually increase sharply, with construction stretching over a decade. Under BOT framework, toll recovery by private concessionaires could force commuters to bear both tolls and taxes for decades.","Adani group has emerged as the lowest bidder for the proposed 17km tunnel road project.

NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation will approach the Supreme Court at the earliest to challenge the Delhi High Court order that suspended the life sentence of former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and granted him bail in the 2017 Unnao rape case, officials said on Wednesday.The decision was taken after the agency examined the order passed by a division bench of the Delhi High Court.According to news agency PTI, a CBI spokesperson said it has been decided to file a special leave petition before the Supreme Court against the ruling that put Sengar’s life sentence on hold during the pendency of his appeal.Despite the bail order, Sengar will continue to remain behind bars as he is separately serving a 10-year jail term in another case linked to the custodial death of the rape survivor’s father, officials clarified.Sengar had approached the Delhi High Court challenging the life sentence awarded to him by a trial court in December 2019.The appeal was strongly opposed by both the CBI and the victim’s family, who raised concerns over safety and alleged threats.The agency said it had filed timely replies and written submissions, while the survivor’s family also opposed the plea on security grounds, reported PTI.On Tuesday, the Delhi High Court suspended Sengar’s sentence, noting that he had already spent around seven years and five months in prison.The suspension will remain in force until his appeal against conviction and sentence is decided.Granting bail, the court imposed strict conditions, including a personal bond of Rs 15 lakh with three sureties of the same amount.The court also directed Sengar not to enter a five-kilometre radius of the survivor’s residence in Delhi and restrained him from issuing any threats to her or her mother. Sengar was convicted for kidnapping and raping the girl in 2017, when she was a minor.The rape case and related matters were shifted from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi in August 2019 on the directions of the Supreme Court.The high court order has triggered strong reactions from the survivor, who described the suspension of Sengar’s sentence as “kaal” or death for her family, reported PTI.She said she would also approach the Supreme Court to seek justice, arguing that such decisions deepen fear among survivors of sexual violence.The survivor and her mother staged a protest in the national capital and later met Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi, seeking support in their legal battle.She alleged that security for her family and legal team had already been withdrawn and claimed that the court’s decision had further heightened concerns for their safety, according to PTI.As the legal battle moves to the Supreme Court, the CBI has said it will press for the high court order to be set aside, reiterating its stand that the conviction and sentence awarded in the Unnao rape case must remain in force.",Cbi to move supreme court against delhi high court order in unnao rape case.

Aravalli Hills Row: Why Definition Battle Could Decide Mining Water Security And AQI In North India

NEW DELHI: Congress on Wednesday slammed the Centre’s directions to states to impose a ban on granting new mining leases in the Aravalli range, calling it a “bogus attempt at damage control that will not fool anybody”Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh alleged that despite the fresh directive, “the Aravallis are not being saved, but are being sold out,” he said in a post on X.On Wednesday, the Union environment ministry directed states to impose a complete ban on new mining leases in the Aravallis and expand protected zones, describing it as a major step toward the “conservation and protection.” The directive aims to safeguard the Aravallis as a continuous geological ridge extending from Gujarat to the NCR and to end unregulated mining across the region.The Centre’s order came after a public row over its new definition of the Aravallis, which classifies an “Aravalli Hill” as a landform with an elevation of at least 100 metres above its surrounding terrain, and an “Aravalli Range” as a cluster of two or more such hills within 500 metres of each other.However, the former Union environment minister dismissed the move as insufficient, arguing that the core issue remains unaddressed. “These are pious proclamations but the dangerous 100m+ redefinition of the Aravallis -- rejected by the Forest Survey of India, the Supreme Court-mandated Central Empowered Committee, and the Supreme Court's amicus curiae -- remains unchanged,” said Ramesh.He has repeatedly said that the redefinition being adopted by the Centre has been opposed by the Forest Survey of India, the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) of the Supreme Court, and the apex court’s amicus curiae.The Bharatiya Janata Party-led Centre rejected the charge that the new definition weakens environmental safeguards, maintaining that more than 90 per cent of the Aravalli region remains protected and that the revised definition does not relax mining controls, reported PTI.In an earlier post, Ramesh had accused the government of misleading the public on the issue. “It is by now abundantly clear that the Union Minister of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change is being economical with the truth on the Aravallis issue and is misleading the public,” he said.He also questioned why the PM Modi-led government is pushing through what he described as a “fatally flawed” redefinition of the Aravallis despite widespread expert opposition.","Congress general secretary jairam ramesh alleged that despite the fresh directive, “the aravallis are not being saved, but are being sold out” on wednesday, the union environment ministry directed states to impose a complete ban on new mining leases.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126163749,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-762827,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

‘Can’t Stay Two Days In Delhi’: Gadkari On Severe Pollution, Transport Sector Role

NEW DELHI: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the NCR and adjoining areas on Wednesday lifted GRAP-IV with immediate effect, even though air quality across large parts of the city remained in the ‘very poor’ category.According to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), areas such as ITO and India Gate recorded AQI levels crossing 350, underscoring the persistence of hazardous air conditions in the national capital.The CAQM said the decision was taken to revoke its order dated December 13, 2025, which had invoked actions under Stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).Stage IV is enforced when air quality reaches the ‘severe+’ category with an AQI above 450. The commission, however, clarified that measures under Stage I, Stage II and Stage III of the extant GRAP will continue and will be implemented as per the modified GRAP dated November 21, 2025.The easing of curbs came hours after the Delhi High Court directed the GST Council to meet at the earliest to consider lowering GST on air purifiers in view of the worsening air quality.During the hearing, the court questioned the Centre over the 18% GST imposed on air purifiers.At the outset, the bench expressed displeasure over the lack of action in the matter, observing that every citizen is entitled to clean air.Earlier, GRAP Stage-IV measures had been enforced across Delhi-NCR to curb rising pollution levels. Under Stage IV, private vehicle movement was not completely banned, with restrictions largely dependent on emission norms and fuel type. While vehicles meeting prescribed standards were allowed to operate, older vehicles face stricter curbs. BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles are not permitted to ply in Delhi-NCR during this phase, except those providing essential services.","The commission for air quality management (caqm) in the ncr and adjoining areas lifted grap-iv with immediate effect.

Aravalli Hills Row: Why Definition Battle Could Decide Mining Water Security And AQI In North India

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Wednesday ordered states to impose a complete ban on new mining leases in the Aravallis and expand protected zones, a major move amid public outcry over the ""new definition"" of the mountain range.The Union environment ministry said the decision was aimed at the ""conservation and protection"" of one of the world’s oldest mountain systems, covering the stretch from Delhi to Gujarat. The directive seeks to safeguard the Aravallis as a continuous geological ridge extending from Gujarat to the National Capital Region and to put an end to unregulated mining across the region.As part of the announcement, the ministry instructed the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) to identify further zones across the Aravallis where mining must be prohibited, beyond those areas already notified by the Centre-based on ecological, geological and landscape-level assessments.The Centre also said it intends to expand the list of areas protected and restricted from mining across the range. For mines that are currently operational, state governments have been asked to ensure ""strict compliance"" with environmental safeguards and adherence to Supreme Court orders.On Monday, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said at a press conference that ""no new mining leases will be permitted, especially in core, protected and ecologically sensitive areas, including the NCR"".Responding to the Supreme Court's acceptance of the ""new definition"" of the Aravallis, he said: ""The ruling recognises and endorses the Government of India’s sustained efforts to protect the Aravalli range through scientific assessment, strict safeguards and initiatives such as the Aravalli Green Wall Project.""He further underlined the government’s efforts such as the expansion of Ramsar sites, afforestation drives and global recognition of India’s forest cover, adding that the BJP-led NDA government remains ""firmly committed to balancing ecology and economy, while countering misinformation with facts and science"".The Supreme Court's acceptance, classifying any landform in Aravalli districts with an elevation of 100 metres or more from the local relief as Aravali Hills-sparked concern among several stakeholders, who fear the new definition could leave more than 90% of the range open to mining, as most landforms fall below the 100-metre threshold.","The directive seeks to safeguard the aravallis as a continuous geological ridge extending from gujarat to the national capital region.

Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi were crying after hearing me. . Rahul Gandhi has given us a lot of strength and assured us that we will get justice...

From Work-From-Home To Vehicle Ban- Delhi Rolls Out Fresh Pollution Curbs

(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Wednesday directed the GST Council to meet at the earliest to consider lowering of GST on air purifiers in view of worsening air quality.During the hearing the court questioned the Centre over the imposition of 18% GST on air purifiers.At the outset of the hearing, the bench voiced its displeasure over the lack of action in the matter, observing that every citizen is entitled to clean air, PTI reported.“Let the purifiers be provided. That’s the minimum you can do. When will you come back?…. Even if it is for temporary, give exemption for next one week or one month… Consider this an emergency situation, only for temporarily. Take instructions and come back,” the bench said.“We will place it before the vacation bench only for compliance. As we speak, we all breathe. You know how many times we breathe in a day, at least 21,000 times a day. Just calculate the harm you are doing to your lungs just by breathing 21,000 times a day, and that’s involuntary,” the bench added.""We will place it before the vacation bench only for compliance.

You know how many times we breathe in a day, at least 21,000 times a day.Just calculate the harm you are doing to your lungs just by breathing 21,000 times a day, and that's involuntary,"" it further added.In the post-lunch session, the counsel council for the government submitted that the issue fell within the policy domain of the GST Council, a body comprising representatives of all states and the Union, and that any meeting must be convened by the Union finance minister, who chairs the council.""This is a policy decision to be taken by GST council. It comprises of members of all States and Union. The meeting has to be called by the union finance minister who heads the council,"" the counsel submitted.Acknowledging that the GST Council is a pan-India body and that convening a meeting may take time, the bench citing the severe air quality in Delhi and adjoining regions, directed that the council meet at the earliest and issued notice to the Centre on the petition.""However, taking into consideration the air quality situation in the state of Delhi and nearby areas, we find it appropriate to require the council to meet at the earliest,"" the bench added and issued notice to the Centre on the petition, as reported by PTI.The plea said that levying GST at the highest slab on air purifiers, now essential for ensuring minimally safe indoor air, makes them unaffordable for large sections of the population.“Imposition of GST at the highest slab upon air-purifiers, a device that has become indispensable for securing minimally safe indoor air, renders such equipment financially inaccessible to large segments of the population and thereby inflicts an arbitrary, unreasonable, and constitutionally impermissible burden,” the plea said.The hearing comes as Delhi continues to choke under toxic smog. Parts of the city, including ITO and India Gate, recorded ‘very poor’ air quality, with AQI levels crossing 350, according to CPCB data. GRAP Stage-IV measures have been enforced across Delhi-NCR.","The delhi high court on wednesday directed the gst council to meet at the earliest to consider lowering of gst on air purifiers.

NEW DELHI: The Unnao rape case survivor on Wednesday said that Kuldeep Singh Sengar’s bail and the Delhi high court decision is like “kaal (death)” for her family and said she will challenge the order in the Supreme Court.“HC decision like ‘kaal (death)’ for us, will challenge order in SC,” the survivor told PTI after the Delhi high court on Tuesday granted bail to expelled BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar and suspended his life sentence in the 2017 Unnao rape case.The Delhi high court granted bail to Sengar while suspending his life sentence, holding that he cannot be kept in jail only on the basis of the threat perception of the victim in the Unnao rape case.While allowing Sengar’s application under Section 389 of the CrPC, the court said, “Kuldeep Singh Sengar can’t be kept in jail only because of the threat perception of the victim in Unnao Rape case,” and added that courts cannot deny bail merely out of apprehension that security agencies may fail in their duty.“At the same time, however, the argument of keeping the appellant (Sengar) in custody because of threat perception to the victim/ survivor, in the opinion of this court, is not a tenable argument to deny the benefit of section 389 CrPC to the appellant,” the bench said in its 53-page verdict.The bench of Justices Subramonium Prasad and Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar observed that such an approach would undermine the work of security forces. “Such an observation or such a thought process would undermine the laudable work of our police/paramilitary forces,” the court said.Suspending Sengar’s sentence till the pendency of his appeal against the December 2019 trial court verdict, the high court noted that he has already spent about seven years and five months in prison and that continued incarceration would violate Article 21 of the Constitution. The appeal has been listed before the roster bench on January 16, 2026, subject to orders of the chief justice.The court imposed several conditions while granting bail, directing Sengar to furnish a personal bond of Rs 15 lakh with three sureties of the same amount. It ordered that all three sureties must be residents of Delhi and directed Sengar to stay in the national capital during the pendency of his appeal. He was also asked to deposit his passport with the trial court and to report to the local police station every Monday at 10 am.Sengar has been barred from entering within a five-kilometre radius of the survivor’s residence and from threatening or contacting her or her mother. “Violation of any of the conditions would lead to cancellation of bail,” the high court said. The court also said he should remain available to complete the remaining part of the sentence if found guilty.On the safety of the survivor, the court said it expects that she will continue to get CRPF cover and directed the deputy commissioner of police of the area where she is residing to personally ensure and supervise her protection during the pendency of the appeal.“The state is also providing for the accommodation of the victim. The Delhi Commission for Women is responsible for ensuring that the victim is provided sufficient accommodation and such arrangement is directed to be continued till further orders,” the bench said, adding that the survivor is free to approach the court if required.The high court noted that the Supreme Court had earlier transferred the trial from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi keeping in mind the survivor’s vulnerability and the custodial death of her father, for which Sengar has been convicted.Despite the suspension of sentence in the rape case, Sengar will continue to remain in jail as he is also serving a 10-year sentence in the custodial death case of the survivor’s father and has not been granted bail in that matter. His appeal in the custodial death case, in which he has sought suspension of sentence, is also pending.Reacting to the order, the survivor told PTI that she was not satisfied with the verdict.“I have small children. There is an elderly, differently-abled mother-in-law and my husband at home. The safety of my children is the biggest concern,” she said.She alleged lapses during the trial and withdrawal of security cover. “Usually, a verdict is pronounced within two or three days after the conclusion of arguments. But in this case, the decision came after three months. Even before the verdict, security for the family and witnesses was withdrawn,” she alleged.The survivor further said, “In the serious crime where my father was murdered and I was subjected to rape, the accused is granted bail after serving a few years in prison. This raises the question of what kind of justice this is.”Sengar was convicted for kidnapping and raping a minor in 2017. The rape case and other connected matters were transferred from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi on the directions of the Supreme Court on August 1, 2019.",Delhi hc grants bail to kuldeep sengar; victim’s sister says ‘put us in jail to keep us safe’ the delhi high court on tuesday granted bail to expelled bjp leaderkuldeep singh senger.

Security forces attacked, senior officers injured

Land rights and Sixth Schedule at the core

Hunger strike, misinformation triggered violence

Internet suspended to prevent escalation

NEW DELHI: Violent protests over alleged illegal non tribal settlement in Assam’s constitutionally protected Karbi Anglong hill region entered the third day on Wednesday, leaving two people dead, dozens injured, and prompting the state government to impose curfew-like restrictions and suspend mobile internet services in two districts.The violence erupted in West Karbi Anglong and adjoining Karbi Anglong district after long simmering tensions over land rights escalated into clashes between tribal protesters and security forces. One tribal protester died in police action, while a non tribal man was killed in a fire that gutted several shops in Kheroni, a small trading town that has emerged as the epicentre of the unrest, police said.Assam DGP Harmeet Singh said 48 police personnel, including senior officers, were injured after protesters armed with bows, arrows, crude bombs and stones attacked security forces. The DGP and IGP Law and Order Akhilesh Kumar Singh were among those injured during the clashes.Police said protesters attempted to take control of a bridge in the area and turned violent when stopped.“Today, they tried to take over the bridge, and when we tried to stop them, they attacked us. Crude bombs and stones were thrown. I was attacked with bows and arrows,” Singh said, adding that the police have video footage and will take legal action against those responsible.The protests are rooted in opposition by the Karbi community to what they allege is illegal encroachment by non tribal settlers on professional grazing reserve and village grazing reserve lands.The districts fall under the Karbi Anglong autonomous council, governed by the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, which grants tribal regions autonomy over land, forests and local governance to protect indigenous communities.Residents have for over a year demanded eviction of alleged encroachers, saying unchecked settlement threatens tribal land rights.Tensions intensified after members of the Karbi community launched a hunger strike on December 6. The situation spiralled on Tuesday after police shifted some fasting protesters to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital due to deteriorating health.According to police, misinformation spread that a protest leader had been arrested, triggering anger and violence.“A huge crowd has gathered here since yesterday. I met the protestors and spoke with them. Last night, their leader was taken to Guwahati for a medical check-up as the doctors thought that his health was deteriorating because of the hunger strike. Still, someone spread misinformation that he is being arrested. Violence does not get anything for anybody,” DGP Harmeet Singh told reporters.State cabinet minister Ranoj Pegu, who met protesters at Kheroni earlier, said the group agreed to call off the hunger strike and participate in tripartite talks on December 26 involving the state government and the Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council.“We assured the Karbi community that the government is serious about land rights and other tribal issues,” Pegu said, adding that discussions would address “broader issues related to existence of Karbi community.”Despite the assurance of talks, violence continued through the day, with shops and markets in Kheroni set ablaze. Police said a special investigation team has been formed and video footage is being examined to identify those involved in arson and attacks.In response to the deteriorating law and order situation, the Assam government on Tuesday ordered suspension of internet and mobile data services in Karbi Anglong and West Karbi Anglong districts with immediate effect.“It is, however, clarified that the voice calls and the broadband connectivity based on fixed telephone lines shall remain functional during this period. Any violation of the promulgation will be punishable under Section 223 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 and also under the relevant provision of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885,” said Biswajit Pegu, Commissioner and Secretary to the Government of Assam, Home and Political Department.The government said district magistrates warned that social media could be used to spread inflammatory messages and rumours, further aggravating tensions.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said he was closely monitoring the situation and announced deployment of additional forces in Kheroni, about 250 km east of Guwahati.“It is deeply painful that two persons lost their lives during today’s unrest,” Sarma said in a post on X, offering condolences to the families of the deceased and assuring all possible support.Authorities said efforts are under way to restore calm, urging community leaders to restrain youths and prevent further violence ahead of the scheduled talks later this week.","Violent protests over alleged illegal non tribal settlement in assam’s constitutionally protected karbi anglong hill region entered the third day on wednesday.

Assam’s Karbi Anglong Gripped By Violence, Internet Suspended As Anger Over ‘Encroachers’ Explodes

NEW DELHI: Assam DGP Harmeet Singh on Wednesday confirmed that the Army has been deployed to restore law and order in violence-hit West Karbi Anglong, news agency PTI reported.The region has now entered its third day of violent protests over alleged illegal settlement by non-tribals in the constitutionally protected Karbi Anglong hill area. The clashes have left two people dead and dozens injured. In response, the Himanta Biswa Sarma-led government has imposed curfew-like restrictions and suspended mobile internet services in two districts to control the situation.Assam CM Himanta said the Karbi people's demand to evict alleged Hindi-speaking encroachers from grazing lands cannot be acted upon immediately, as the matter is currently under a stay order issued by the Gauhati high court.The violence in West Karbi Anglong and the neighbouring Karbi Anglong district began after long-standing tensions over land rights escalated into clashes between tribal protesters and security forces. Police said one tribal protester died during police action, while a non-tribal man was killed in a fire that destroyed several shops in Kheroni, a small trading town that has now become the centre of the unrest.Assam DGP Harmeet Singh said that 48 police personnel, including senior officers, were injured when protesters armed with bows, arrows, crude bombs and stones attacked security forces.Both the DGP and IGP (Law and Order) Akhilesh Kumar Singh were among those hurt.

Crude bombs and stones were thrown. I was hit with bows and arrows,” the DGP said. He added that police have video evidence and will take legal action against the attackers.The protests stem from claims by the Karbi community that non-tribal settlers have illegally encroached on professional grazing reserve and village grazing reserve lands.
