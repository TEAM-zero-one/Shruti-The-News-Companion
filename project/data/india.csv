Maha panel to frame law on 'love jihad'

MUMBAI: Maharashtra govt on Friday set up a special seven-member committee headed by the DGP to frame a law against 'love jihad.'A government resolution (GR) said that apart from the DGP, the panel would have six other members from various departments: one member each from the women and child development, minority development department, law and judiciary, social justice and special assistance department, and two home department representatives. The GR contained the term 'love jihad.'CM Devendra Fadnavis had said in the past that Maharashtra was planning to introduce a law against forced religious conversions , particularly in cases of inter-faith marriages through conversion ('love jihad'), following similar legislations enacted in Uttar Pradesh and other states.Samajwadi Party MLA Rais Shaikh has opposed this move. He said the state govt lacks statistical evidence for such cases and is politicising the issue of forced conversion by labelling it as 'jihad.'The GR specified the committee's responsibilities: evaluating the current situation, handling complaints about 'love jihad' and forced religious conversions, examining other states' laws, establishing legal frameworks, and reviewing legal implications. The document mentioned requests from public representatives, organisations and citizens to prevent 'love jihad' and forced religious conversions.The committee will analyse current circumstances and recommend measures regarding 'love jihad' complaints and forced conversions, whilst studying existing legal structures in other states to develop suitable legislation.Shaikh said, ""Earlier the govt came up with a proposal after stating that there were over one lakh cases of 'love jihad' in the state, but they were unable to find a single instance where they could file a police case. There is no data available to support any such claim, and I had raised this issue in the assembly. The govt is playing politics over the issue.""When Fadnavis was deputy chief minister in the Mahayuti government in 2023, he had said, ""Many cases have come up of girls getting married and converting. There is demand from all corners to make a law against this. Earlier, I had made an announcement in the House also. Accordingly, study of laws in various states is on and then the decision about it in Maharashtra will be taken.""",Devendra fadnavis had said in the past that maharashtra was planning to introduce a law against forced religious conversions. Samajwadi party mla rais shaikh has opposed this move. He said the state govt lacks statistical evidence for such cases.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118262338,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-20962,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

'Govt likely to move court to withdraw all such cases'

NEW DELHI: Days after BJP defeated AAP in the assembly polls, the law department of Delhi government has sought details of all court cases filed by the outgoing dispensation against the Centre and lieutenant governor in the last few years.Sources claimed more than Rs 300 crore was spent on ""inter-department"" litigation and court battles between the AAP govt and the Centre or the LG in the last few years. It also resulted in the loss of precious man-hours, which now needed to be cut down. They added that a comprehensive report on the ongoing litigation would be placed before the new dispensation to take a view.The AAP govt, the LG, and the Centre were involved in frequent tussles over various issues related to governance, resulting in a number of court cases. There was an increase in the number of court cases after V K Saxena was sworn in as LG of Delhi in May 2022. Some of the prominent cases being heard in Supreme Court and high court include the outgoing AAP dispensation challenging the law bringing 'services' under LG's domain and the formation of a high-level committee, with Saxena as its chairman, to prevent pollution in the Yamuna.A senior Delhi govt official said it was the BJP-led central govt that decided that the services-related matters in Delhi govt should come under the direct control of the LG and brought an ordinance after the Supreme Court decided otherwise, subsequently backing it up with a law on the issue.""With BJP now in office in Delhi, there will be no need to continue such cases. The new dispensation may like to move the court to withdraw such cases,"" said an official. ""The withdrawal of these cases will also do away with unnecessary friction between the Centre/LG and the elected dispensation, and the two will be able to develop a cordial relationship and work towards the development of the city,"" he added.In an internal communication to all additional chief secretaries, principal secretaries and secretaries, the law, justice and legislative affairs department of Delhi sought the detailed list of all cases, mentioning the issue involved in the case, the last directions issued by the respective court, and the replies filed by the department concerned.The law department also sought to know the names of the counsel engaged by the Chief Minister or ministers in the outgoing dispensation, the details of the defence counsel of the administrative department, and the next date of hearing in each case.In a separate office memorandum, the law department advised the standing counsel, additional standing counsel, and empanelled counsel to ensure that written and verbal statements made by them before any court are strictly in consonance with the written instructions given to them with the approval of the administrative secretary of the department concerned.","Sources claimed more than rs 300 crore was spent on ""inter-department"" litigation and court battles between the aap govt and the centre or the lg in the last few years.

Students sought cancellation of book fair due to exams: University

DEHRADUN: A book fair scheduled for Feb 15-16 at Uttarakhand's HNB Garhwal University , the state's only central university situated in Srinagar (Pauri Garwhal), has been cancelled, with organisers alleging pressure from right-wing groups for the cancellation. The event, titled 'Kitab Kauthik', a popular platform for book lovers which is annually organised by the group Creative Uttarakhand, was initially scheduled for Jan at Govt Girls' Inter College.""We had received permission from the school, but the management later cancelled it without assigning a reason. Since elections were approaching, we postponed the event to Feb,"" said Hem Pant, the fair's coordinator.The organisers then approached the central university for permission to hold the event at its premises and initially claimed to have received a go-ahead, which they said was later revoked. ""Representatives of the students' union and ABVP told us that 'books on Gandhi and Nehru were not fit to be sold'. They convinced the university to revoke the permission,"" Pant alleged.University spokesperson Ashutosh Bahuguna denied that permission was revoked due to pressure from any group. ""Our students' body suggested that holding a book fair may interfere with the ongoing exams and distract students, which is why the organisers were asked to find an alternate location,"" he said.Ashish Pant, a student union representative from RSS-backed ABVP, claimed there were no ideological reasons for the event's cancellation. ""Initially, approval was given to them for a small setup near the university library, but we later learned they had planned multiple cultural programmes. All of this was happening in the middle of exams. It was students themselves who raised concerns, which led to the university revoking the permission based on our recommendation."" He also rejected claims that ABVP had objected to the nature of the books that were to be sold.Meanwhile, the organisers tried to shift the fair to Ramlila Ground in Srinagar but met with a roadblock there too. ""The Ramlila Ground committee okayed holding the event but later we were told that RSS had already booked the venue for the same dates. We subsequently found that their application was dated Feb 10, while we had applied on Feb 9,"" said Hem Pant. He also alleged that the right-wing group covered book fair banners with their own posters.""When we sought clarification from the administration, we did not get a satisfactory response. This is a simple book fair designed for students and youngsters.. We bring over 50,000 books to small towns and the last edition was held in Tehri. Even CM Pushkar Singh Dhami encouraged us to organise more of them. Against this backdrop, such politically motivated discouragement is disheartening,"" he added.SDM Srinagar, Nupur Verma, when contacted, said, ""No application came to me from the book fair organisers, and the RSS event was already scheduled much earlier.""",Book fair scheduled for feb 15-16 at uttarakhand's hnb garhwal university has been cancelled.

NEW DELHI: Influencer Ranveer Allahbadia , in the eye of a storm for his recent alleged offensive comments on social media, on Friday moved Supreme Court objecting to Assam Police registering an FIR against him for his unsavoury remarks despite Mumbai Police already inquiring into it.For Allahbadia, whose petition was e-filed before SC at 2.37 am, advocate Abhinav Chandrachud requested a bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar for an early hearing. When the CJI told him that he would decide listing of the petition as soon as possible, Chandrachud apprehended that Assam Police may resort to coercive action despite Mumbai Police already conducting an inquiry.The bench reiterated the standard operating procedure - send a request for urgent listing through email to be dealt with appropriately by the registry.Allahbadia cited the judgment in the case of Arnab Goswami, which was authored by a bench headed by former CJI D Y Chandrachud, where multiple FIRs on the same incidents (lynching of sadhus in Gadchinchle village of Maharashtra's Palghar district in Apr 2020) were ordered to be consolidated at Mumbai. Multiple FIRs were registered against Goswami in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Jharkhand and even in J&K.SC website does not indicate any date of hearing in Allahbadia's writ petition. Mumbai Police had said it was inquiring into the matter without registering an FIR. However, Assam Police has registered FIR against five people, including Allahbadia and comedian Samay Raina, for the alleged offensive remarks made on a YouTube show .

NEW DELHI: Nearly 36,000 children are missing without a trace across India since 2020 even though the state and central police have recovered majority of the nearly 3 lakh children who went missing in the last four years, Centre informed SC on Friday.Appearing for petitioner, senior advocate Aparna Bhat told a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Satish Chandra Sharma that there are several cases where state police is impeded in prosecuting persons involved in the inter-state child-trafficking racket and requested the court for a probe by a national agency like CBI.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati informed the court that apart from 'khoya-paya' portal, Centre has advised states to transfer missing children cases to anti-human trafficking unit , if they remain untraced for four months of lodging of complaints by parents or relatives. She said Centre has provided financial assistance to the tune of Rs 100 crore to states and UTs for upgrading and setting up of anti-human trafficking units covering every district to address 'prevention, protection and prosecution' aspects of the child kidnapping cases.But the data provided by states and collated by Centre narrated a heart-rending story of thousands of parents waiting for years for the return of their missing children. In Bihar, over 24,000 children have been found missing since 2020. The police are yet to trace over 12,600 of them, the status report said.The highest number of missing children at 58,665 were from MP , but the police could trace 45,585 within four months. However, 3,955 are yet to be traced. Like Bihar, as many as 24,291 children in Odisha went missing since 2020, and the police are yet to locate 4,852 of them. Centre informed court that despite several reminders, Delhi, Punjab, Nagaland, Jharkhand, TN , WB , J&K and AP did not provide data relating to missing children and the number of traced ones.","Nearly 36,000 children are missing without a trace across india since 2020.

"Delhi-Mumbai Expressway: Delhi Mumbai Expressway completion delayed by 2 years, Gujarat sections hold up progress",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-mumbai-expressway-completion-delayed-by-2yrs-gujarat-sections-hold-up-progress/articleshow/118223485.cms,"Delhi-Mumbai expressway

NEW DELHI: The completion of the entire Delhi-Mumbai Expressway would take around two more years as there has been delay in construction of around half a dozen stretches of the project, particularly three sections with a total length of 87 km in Gujarat . In one of these sections (35 km), there is no physical progress and in the remaining two, it’s barely 7% and 35%.The 1,382-km expressway project was divided into smaller packages for carrying out construction simultaneously. Separate packages were bid out for construction at different points of time with the deadline set for March 2024. Subsequently, the deadline was extended and Oct 2025 was set as the revised deadline for the entire project. Just before the Delhi polls, Harsh Malhotra, MoS for road transport and highways, had said the entire expressway would be ready in 2026. He had cited logistical and technical challenges, particularly issues with land acquisition for the delay.Going by the trend of highway construction , it takes at least two years for a section of NH or expressway to be complete from the start of work. So, one can expect that the much delayed 35-km section in Gujarat may be complete for traffic by Feb 2027, sources said. These three packages have been awarded to one highway builder.Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari reviewed the progress of the ambitious Rs 1 lakh crore project on Tuesday evening with top officials from NHAI and his ministry. The minister directed officials to expedite the work. The project passes through Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Once completed, the expressway will reduce the travel time from Delhi to Mumbai to barely 12 hours.Sources said while work in the Haryana section is complete, all packages falling under Rajasthan would be ready for traffic by March-April 2026. “With this, one can travel from Delhi to Vadodara nonstop using the expressway by March next year. All agencies concerned are putting their best effort to expedite delayed works in Gujarat,” said an official.TOI has learnt that all packages of the expressway project in Maharashtra are likely to be completed by this year-end, except the 21-km link to Jawaharlal Nehru Port. Sources said while as per the original plan the construction of this section was to be taken up by Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), the highway ministry gave in-principle approval for NHAI to build this stretch.Sources said detailed cost of this stretch would be worked out soon for getting necessary approval.","The 1,382-km expressway project was divided into smaller packages.

Haryana bitterness

AAP's gains threat to Congress?

Way forward

NEW DELHI: Alliance first or party first? For the Congress, one of the biggest dilemmas has been how to recalibrate its relationship with the regional parties which have dislodged it from power in states but are allies at the national level under the banner of the INDIA bloc. The Congress has been engaged in a constant power struggle with the regional parties in several states - as they try to gain an upper hand over each other.However, after a decade of dithering, has the Congress finally decided its future course of action vis-à-vis the regional parties? The just-concluded Delhi election was a glaring example of an aggressive Congress strategy. The grand-old-party did not win any seat in Delhi assembly, for the third time in a row, but managed to play a crucial role in dislodging Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party from power. The division of votes between the two parties helped the BJP in as many as 14 seats.The Congress faced a lot of flak after the Delhi dangal, both from outside and within, but the message for other regional parties was loud and clear. West Bengal Congress president Subhankar Sarkar's remark sums up the thinking within the party. ""Actually, after the Delhi poll results, many regional parties have realised that it was a mistake to ignore the Congress in that election. The problem with parties such as AAP and those who think like them is that they are nothing more than the B-team of the BJP,"" the Bengal Congress chief said targeting West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, who has ruled out an alliance with Congress for the 2026 assembly elections in the state.The 2025 Delhi assembly elections saw Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal - two key leaders of the opposition's INDIA bloc - turn into bitter rivals. The two senior leaders left no stone unturned to attack and discredit each other right through the campaign, making a mockery of the INDIA bloc - which was formed to keep the opposition united against the BJP - and much to the delight of the BJP. The intensity of Rahul's aggression against Kejriwal was a message to other regional allies that the Congress could go to any extent if it was not given its due share.After the results were out, the Congress asserted that Delhi election results were a referendum on Arvind Kejriwal and even claimed credit for dislodging the AAP government. ""Congress took lead in highlighting various scams under Kejriwal, voters pronounced judgement on 12 years of misrule,"" Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said after the results.Delhi is not the first election where INDIA bloc partners have fought against each other. We have seen Congress fight Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal, Left front in Kerala. However, the bitterness and aggression in Delhi was perhaps unmatched given the fact that Congress with zero seats in last two elections was nowhere close to regaining power in Delhi.So, why did Rahul decide to go all-out against Kejriwal? Does AAP's Delhi defeat help Congress in any way?The AAP and the Congress have shared a love-hate relationship for long as the two parties have been at loggerheads several times on various issues. When Centre was planning to bring an ordinance in Parliament to curtail powers of the elected Delhi government after a SC ruling, AAP had urged all INDIA partners, including the Congress, to oppose the move. As the Congress initially dithered to openly back Kejriwal on the ordinance, AAP threatened to boycott INDIA bloc meeting convened by the grand-old-party. On one occasion when a Delhi Congress spokesperson said that the party was preparing to contest all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi, AAP responded with a threat to walk out of the INDIA bloc. Clearly, there was a lot of pent up animosity between the two parties which was on display during the campaign as the two top leaders openly attacked each other.The bitterness between Congress and AAP increased manifold during the Haryana assembly elections held last year when the two parties failed to stitch an alliance despite Rahul Gandhi openly advocating a joint fight against the BJP. In the run up to Delhi elections , Arvind Kejriwal outrightly ruled out any alliance with the Congress even before there could be any talks on seat sharing.Other than Congress, Arvind Kejriwal's AAP was the only party in opposition's INDIA alliance that was ruling two states - Delhi and Punjab. In both these states, AAP gains were at the expense of the Congress. While AAP formed its first government in Delhi in 2013, it captured power in Punjab in 2022 decimating the grand-old-party in the state. In the last 10 years, AAP had made significant gains registering its presence in several states and turning itself into a national party. No other regional party in the INDIA bloc had two states under its belt. Clearly AAP's victory in Delhi would have given more strength to Kejriwal within the opposition alliance and would have further sidelined the Congress.Assembly elections are due in Bihar later this year. The Congress and Lalu Prasad's RJD are allies in the state and are expected to contest the elections together. We have already seen some muscle flexing by Bihar Congress leaders over being treated as junior partner in the alliance. There was an immediate pushback to this Congress effort from RJD's Lalu Prasad who openly backed Mamata Banerjee as the leader of INDIA bloc and dismissed any objections that the Congress may have. Then Tejashwi Yadav added to this RJD posturing with his statement that the INDIA bloc was only formed for the Lok Sabha elections. However, Rahul's meeting with Lalu during his Bihar visit last month may help ease tensions between the two parties.And while INDIA bloc may not reach the tipping point in Bihar, in West Bengal where elections are due in 2026 - we may see a repeat of the Delhi dangal. Mamata who has written off the Congress in the state just as Kejriwal did in Delhi, would hope that the grand-old-party does not end up dividing the anti-BJP votes and in the process put spanner in her march to a record fourth term in the state.When Prime Minister Modi, in his Rajya Sabha speech, accused the Congress of following the policy of impeding others (Dusre ki lakeer chhoti karo) instead of increasing its own potential, it was a political attack intended to deepen the divide between the Congress and its regional allies in the INDIA bloc. However, it seems the Congress, which has lost much of its support base to other parties, is ready to follow this strategy for now to reclaim its lost political ground. Whether or not it succeeds only time can tell?","After a decade of dithering, has the congress finally decided its future course of action vis-à-vis the regional parties? The just-concluded delhi election was a glaring example of an aggressive congress strategy. The intensity of rahul's aggression against kejriwal was a message to other regional allies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118254299,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-59034,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

The Assam police team met with Maharashtra Cyber Department officials on Thursday.Mumbai police, who have not yet registered an FIR, have so far recorded seven statements, including those of Makhija, Chanchlani, and Allahbadia’s manager, based on a complaint from a BJP functionary.Additionally, Mumbai police have summoned Pratham Sagar, the video editor of 'India’s Got Latent,' for questioning on Friday afternoon.The Maharashtra Cyber Department has also summoned at least 50 individuals connected to the show. Among them is actor and television personality Raghu Ram, who was on the show’s judging panel and recorded his statement on Thursday.With mounting legal scrutiny and police expanding their probe across multiple states, Allahbadia and others involved in the show may face further questioning in the coming days.

THIRVANANTHAPURAM: The Centre has approved an interest-free capital investment loan of Rs 529.5 crore for rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts in landslide-hit Wayanad under a special scheme for providing financial assistance to states. The loan, with a repayment period of 50 years, is earmarked for 16 projects, including township development, road infrastructure and construction of public buildings. It was was formally communicated to state govt on February 11.The Centre has sought detailed expenditure estimates by March as the loan is sanctioned for the 2024-25 financial year. It also specified that the allocated funds should be fully utilised before March 31.State finance minister K N Balagopal said the tight deadline would be a problem. ""This is a loan, not a grant, and must be used before March 31. It's an impractical solution as the funds are meant for infrastructure projects like roads,"" he said, adding that the issue would be raised with the Centre.The Centre has warned that any diversion of funds could result in the reduction or withdrawal of the sanctioned amount. The disbursal and utilisation of the loan will be closely monitored to ensure compliance with the outlined guidelines, it said.The landslides that occurred in Punchirimattam, Mundakkai and Chooralmala villages in Meppadi panchayat of Wayanad on July 30 last year had claimed 298 lives (including 44 people reported missing), besides causing widespread destruction. State govt had sought a special package of Rs 2,000 crore for rehabilitation, but the request remains under judicial review.","The centre has approved an interest-free capital investment loan of rs 529.5 crore for rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts in landslide-hit wayanad.

AMRITSAR: Two more planeloads of Indians deported from the US are scheduled to land in Amritsar over the weekend, with the first of these flights expected around 10am Saturday with 119 illegal immigrants.The impending sorties, just over 10 days after a US military C-17 Globemaster aircraft brought back 104 deportees, led CM Bhagwant Mann to slam Centre for allegedly trying to ""defame Punjab and Punjabis"" by turning holy city of Amritsar into what he termed ""a deportation centre"".Sources said 67 of 119 passengers on the second deportation flight were from Punjab, while Haryana accounted for second-largest group with 33.

MHA seeks President’s approval to prosecute former Delhi minister Satyendar Jain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mha-seeks-presidents-approval-to-prosecute-former-delhi-minister-satyendar-jain/articleshow/118240478.cms,"NEW DELHI: The ministry of home affairs ( MHA ) on Friday sought the President of India ’s approval to prosecute former Delhi minister and AAP leader Satyendar Jain under Section 218 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Suraksha Sanhita (BNS), 2023, officials said.According to PTI sources, the request is based on evidence provided by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which has found sufficient grounds for prosecution in the case.Officials said, “On the basis of the material received from the Enforcement Directorate, sufficient evidence has been found to grant the sanction.”The MHA’s move comes after reviewing findings from the ED’s investigation into alleged financial irregularities linked to Jain. The final decision now rests with the President.The ED’s case against Jain stems from a 2017 FIR filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) under Section 13(2) (criminal misconduct by a public servant) read with Section 13(e) (disproportionate assets) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.The agency alleged that Jain, with the help of his family members and associates, amassed disproportionate assets between February 14, 2015, and May 31, 2017, while serving as a minister in the Delhi government. The ED further claimed that several companies owned and controlled by Jain received accommodation entries amounting to ₹4.8 crore from shell companies in exchange for cash routed through Kolkata-based hawala operators.Two other accused, Vaibhav Jain and Ankush Jain, were said to be major shareholders and directors in three of these companies. The Delhi high court had recently dismissed their default bail pleas on October 1.The court highlighted the importance of individual liberty, particularly in cases governed by stringent laws such as the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). It relied on the Supreme Court’s judgment in the Manish Sisodia case, which underscored the fundamental right to a speedy trial.Jain’s counsel, senior advocate N Hariharan and advocate Vivek Jain, argued that he had spent 18 months in custody, while former Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia, arrested in the alleged excise policy scam, had spent 17 months before being granted bail. They pointed out that the case involves 108 witnesses and over 5,000 pages of documents, making the trial a lengthy process.Opposing the bail plea, the ED contended that Jain could influence witnesses if released. However, the court imposed strict conditions, barring him from travelling outside India without permission, contacting witnesses, or influencing the trial in any way.Jain’s legal team also cited previous judgments in interim PMLA cases where bail had been granted despite stringent conditions. They noted that almost all accused in the Delhi excise policy case, which allegedly involves hundreds of crores, have been granted bail.","The request is based on evidence provided by the enforcement directorate (ed) the final decision now rests with the president.

AHMEDABAD: An insurance company is liable to pay compensation in an accident case involving a truck driver without a proper licence if it fails to establish negligence on part of the vehicle owner in verifying the driver's licence, Gujarat high court has ruled.The observation came while dismissing a petition by ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co Ltd, which challenged a motor accident claims tribunal 's order awarding compensation to an accident victim.One Jayesh Dharavia of Jamnagar died in a road accident involving a truck in 2010. The truck driver, Ramsingh Yadav, had a licence to drive a two-wheeler and a light motor vehicle, but not a truck, which falls in the category of a heavy motor vehicle. In 2014, a motor accident claims tribunal ordered truck owner Sureshchandra Aum Prakash and his insurer, ICICI Lombard, to pay Rs 19 lakh, along with 7.5% interest, as compensation to the deceased's family.The insurance company moved HC, contending that the driver was not authorised to drive the truck. Citing breach of policy terms and the vehicle owner's failure in employing a qualified driver with a valid licence, the company argued that it could not be held liable to pay the compensation.The HC said the insurer had failed to establish that it had requested the vehicle owner to verify the driver's licence, or that it had drawn the owner's attention to be vigilant in this regard. The insurer also could not prove that the owner knew that the driver's licence was not valid, or that he employed the driver despite knowing.","Icici lombard general insurance co ltd challenged a motor accident claims tribunal's order awarding compensation to an accident victim.

PANAJI: A special court Friday discharged former Goa chief minister and BJP's Margao MLA Digambar Kamat in the Kadnekar Mines cases for the alleged condonation of delay in the renewal of its mining lease, which resulted in a loss of Rs 135 crore to the state exchequer. Fifteeen others were also discharged in the case.An SIT had filed a 700-page chargesheet in Feb 2018 against Kamat, govt officials and others, and recorded statements from 25 witnesses. Kamat - then Congress CM holding the mines portfolio - allowed the condonation of delay by overruling the observations of two IAS officers, the SIT said.The chargesheet said state govt had no powers to allow condonation of delay.Justice M B Shah Commission, which investigated the scam, had observed that several mining companies were allowed to fraudulently use the clause of condonation of delay for renewal of their leases.The commission pegged the loss through the alleged mining scam at Rs 35,000 crore.Then-SP (crime branch) Karthik Kashyap said taking advantage of the condonation, the Margao-based Kadnekar family, which has stakes in mining in Goa, entered into an agreement with Magnum Minerals Pvt Ltd, thereby transferring the rights of lease without the Centre and state govt's approval and allowing them to mine iron ore.Kashyap said as per the figures provided by Kadnekar Mines, there was a loss to the tune of Rs 135 crore to the state exchequer.","Digambar kamat discharged in the kadnekar mines cases.

Facing flak, Kerala restores full funding for

minority scholarships

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The LDF government in Kerala decided on Friday to restore full funding of nine minority scholarships that had been slashed by 50% last month, triggering allegations about students from marginalised communities being forced to bear a disproportionate share of cuts purportedly meant to reduce the exchequer's burden.The policy reversal order states that the original allocation of Rs 13.6 crore for these nine scholarships had been restored. The Pinarayi Vijayan govt also announced an additional allocation of Rs 11 crore for the Margadeepam scholarship , raising the total plan size to Rs 20 crore. Although this scholarship was not among the nine affected by the cuts reported by TOI on Jan 31, the increase in its allocation reflects a renewed effort to support students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, sources said.The rollback came amid criticism from opposition parties, academicians and community leaders, who flagged the cuts as being a potential trigger for higher dropouts.The Prof Joseph Mundassery Scholarship, which supports economically disadvantaged high achievers from the minority community, had taken the biggest cut. The scholarship pays Rs 10,000 each to SSLC students securing A+ in all subjects and Rs 15,000 to those excelling in higher secondary exam and vocational courses.The Mother Teresa Scholarship, which supports students from Christian, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain and Parsi communities pursuing diploma courses in nursing and paramedical institutions, was among those hit by now-revoked cuts. Funding for civil services exam coaching for minority candidates, UGC coaching reimbursement and scholarships for students studying abroad have also been fully restored.","The policy reversal order states that the original allocation of rs 13.6 crore for these nine scholarships had been restored.

AMRAVATI: Even beggars don't accept one rupee in alms, but govt is giving crop insurance for this sum and this too is being misused, Maharashtra agriculture minister Manikrao Kokate said Friday, triggering sharp reactions from farm outfits and opposition parties.The minister, an NCP MLA from Nashik, was answering a query on the Re 1 crop insurance scheme after a meeting in Amravati.Kokate, however, clarified there was no plan to discontinue the scheme, but changes would be made to plug loopholes. ""Govt rejected 4 lakh insurance claim applications. These may have been turned down because of erroneous entries. The scheme has been beneficial, but it was turned into a scam by certain elements.""Former Congress president Nana Patole said, ""The Mahayuti govt must apologise to farmers. What was promised for Re 1 is now being hiked 100 times. And the agriculture minister is insulting farmers by comparing them with beggars."" Later, Kokate said his statement was ""misinterpreted and distorted"", and he was ""only talking about irregularities by outside companies"".Maharashtra govt introduced a crop insurance scheme for a rupee in 2023.Earlier, farmers had to shell out around Rs 750 to Rs 1,100 a hectare towards premium, which is now borne by the state. A spokesperson of Swabhimani Shetkari Paksha said Vidarbha is already dogged by farm suicides and such statements can aggravate the situation. Activist Vijay Jawandhia said, ""Charging one rupee is also a mere formality. Govt should make it free, and applications should go directly from the talati's office. Now, farmers depend on community service centres to fill up their forms. Direct applications will do away with fraud.""
