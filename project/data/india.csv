M R K Panneerselvam sparks row with ‘North Indians clean tables’ in Tamil Nadu remark; BJP hits back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/panneerselvam-sparks-row-with-north-indians-clean-tables-in-tamil-nadu-remark-bjp-hits-back/articleshow/127922094.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday hit out at a Tamil Nadu minister over remarks about North Indian migrant workers, accusing the ruling DMK of repeatedly targeting migrants and fuelling social divisions in the state.The BJP was reacting to comments made by DMK agriculture minister M R K Panneer Selvam at a party event in Chengalpattu, where he referred to North Indians working in low-paying jobs.""People from the North are coming here to clean tables, engage in construction works, sell pani puri. Because he learnt only Hindi and had no job opportunity there, he has come here,"" the minister said.In a post on X, the BJP said the remarks were derogatory and reflected a broader pattern within the DMK.""At a party event in Chengalpattu, Tamil Nadu, DMK agriculture minister Shri MRK Panneer mocked North Indian migrants as “table cleaners and pani puri sellers.” In today’s India, people from every state work everywhere - North, South, and across the world. No job is small. No citizen is inferior,"" the party said.The BJP alleged that such comments were particularly dangerous at a time when incidents of violence against migrant workers were being reported in Tamil Nadu.""This isn’t an isolated slip; it’s a pattern. DMK leaders have repeatedly derided migrant workers, especially for being North Indian or for speaking Hindi. At a time when violence against innocent migrant workers in Tamil Nadu is rising, such statements are reckless and dangerous, branding an entire community as “low standard” and fuelling hate on the streets,"" the post said.The party also questioned the silence of leaders from the opposition INDI alliance over the controversy.""Now a direct question to the INDI alliance: if you claim to stand for unity, human dignity, and social justice, why this deafening silence? Is alliance compulsion more important than national unity? Do Shri RahulGandhi, Priyanka Gandhi , Akhilesh Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav endorse this hatred by staying quiet? Is this your idea of justice which is dividing Indians for votes? Complete shame!"" the BJP said.There was no immediate response from the DMK or the leaders named by the BJP on the issue.Meanwhile, Tamilnadu BJP president in a post on X said, ""Leaders of Arivalayam who incite hatred against North Indians!Even as attacks on North Indians are already rampant under the DMK regime, I strongly condemn the Minister of DMK, Mr. MRK Panneer,for mocking them at a meeting held in Maduranthakam in Chengalpattu district by saying, “North Indians come to Tamil Nadu only to sell pani puri, work in construction, or wipe tables.” The DMK Minister must immediately seek a public apology from the people for his arrogant speech.In our Tamil land, which has upheld equality and brotherhood through the life philosophy of “Yadhum Oore, Yaavarum Keleer,” it is not only deplorable but also dangerous that DMK leaders continue to sow seeds of hatred against North Indians. Do the Congress and Communist parties, as alliance partners of DMK, endorse this divisive politics of the DMK, which strives to divide people ethnically into North and South?In our Bharat, which shares a unified cultural heritage “from the Himalayas to Kanyakumari,” the people will uproot and cast away this venomous creeper called DMK—which toils to seize power and authority by using North Indian people as scapegoats—in the upcoming Assembly elections!""","The bjp was reacting to comments made by dmk agriculture minister m r k panneer selvam at a party event in chengalpattu.

"Breast, cervical cancers rising steadily; deaths also climbing, govt data shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/breast-cervical-cancers-rising-steadily-deaths-also-climbing-govt-data-shows/articleshow/127922880.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Breast, cervical and ovarian cancer cases have risen steadily in India over the past five years, with deaths also increasing, according to new government data tabled in Parliament — underscoring the growing burden of cancers that largely affect women and the urgency of early detection.Figures from the National Cancer Registry Programme show breast cancer cases rose from about 2.13 lakh in 2021 to nearly 2.4 lakh in 2025. Cervical cancer cases increased from around 77,000 to over 79,000, while ovarian cancer cases climbed from about 45,000 to nearly 49,500 over the same period.Deaths have followed a similar upward trend. Breast cancer deaths increased from about 91,700 in 2021 to over 1.03 lakh in 2025. Cervical cancer deaths rose from roughly 41,500 to nearly 42,800, and ovarian cancer deaths from about 27,600 to more than 30,000 in five years.Large states such as Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka reported the highest absolute numbers of breast and cervical cancer cases, while northeastern states including Assam, Mizoram and Manipur continued to show disproportionately high cervical cancer rates relative to population size.The data was shared by the Union health ministry in response to a Rajya Sabha question. Officials said the rise reflects both an increasing disease burden and improved detection through expanded screening.Oncologists said the figures point to gaps that still need urgent attention. Dr Pragya Shukla, head of clinical oncology at Delhi State Cancer Institute, said the data reinforces the need to accelerate screening, HPV vaccination, timely referral and affordable treatment, warning that gaps in awareness and early care continue to drive avoidable deaths.To address the trend, the Centre said it is strengthening cancer care under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases. At present, 770 district NCD clinics, 364 district day-care cancer centres and over 6,400 NCD clinics at community health centres are operational nationwide, with 297 more district day-care cancer centres approved for 2025–26.Population-based screening for people aged 30 years and above is being scaled up for early detection of breast and cervical cancer. The ministry said 19 State Cancer Institutes, 20 Tertiary Cancer Care Centres and cancer facilities across 22 new AIIMS are also part of the expansion.","Figures from the national cancer registry programme show breast cancer cases rose from about 2.13 lakh in 2021 to nearly 2.4 lakh in 2025.

NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India will hold a conference of all state election commissioners (SECs) here on Feb 24, to discuss issues which include the sharing of ECI electronic voting machines (EVMs), electoral rolls and technological innovations like ECINet for smoother conduct of panchayat and municipal polls by state election commissions.While ECI conducts Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha and assembly elections, besides presidential and vice-presidential polls, the SECs, created by state laws based on the 73rd and 74th Constitutional amendments, are tasked with holding elections to panchayats and municipal bodies in states.The SEC conference — being held after a gap of 25 years — has been convened by CEC Gyanesh Kumar after several state poll commissions approached him in the last one year, seeking national-level deliberations to iron out issues and coordinate efforts of EC and SECs on matters like eligibility of electors as per the electoral law, the borrowing of ECI EVMs for holding local polls.","Election commission of india will hold a conference of all state election commissioners (secs) here on feb 24.

PUNE: As suspense over the merger of the two NCPs continues, family patriarch Sharad Pawar on Wednesday met late nephew Ajit Pawar ’s wife Sunetra Pawar at her residence in Baramati for the first time after she took oath as Maharashtra’s deputy CM.Amid reports of a division in the family, Pawar, Sunetra, her sons Parth and Jay, and other relatives held a closed-door meeting in their hometown late Wednesday, reigniting the reunification buzz. Pawar Senior and his wife Pratibha offered condolences to Ajit Pawar’s family, and together, they all met locals who visited them.The NCP (SP) chief had, a few days ago, made his disappointment clear as he said Sunetra did not consult him about taking up the deputy CM’s post last week. However, he told reporters in Baramati on Wednesday morning he supported her decision. “I am happy that she was given the opportunity.” Despite ill health, he spent the entire day in a series of meetings in Baramati.

NEW DELHI: In a suspected case of road rage, a 36-year-old businessman has died after allegedly being beaten with a helmet by two food-delivery riders during a brawl in Connaught Place last month. Police have arrested the two men.The deceased, Shivam Gupta, lived with his parents in Laxmi Nagar and ran a construction business with his brother-in-law. The incident occurred in the early hours of Jan 3 when Gupta, returning from a party with a friend, was walking near the Rajiv Chowk metro station in the E-block parking area.Police said he brushed against the handle of an approaching bike, leading to an argument, after which the accused allegedly assaulted him with their helmets and fled, leaving him bleeding on the pavement.Gupta, critically injured, underwent multiple medical procedures across hospitals and briefly showed signs of recovery before he died on Jan 19.His father, Anil Kant Gupta, who runs garment shops, said CCTV footage shown to him by police featured three men — a detail also recorded in the FIR. However, officers told him only two men were directly involved in the assault and have been arrested, while the third allegedly handed over the helmet used in the attack.Distraught, the father said, ""All I want is that no innocent man is punished and no guilty man walks free."" Fighting back tears, he added, ""My son was known to make peace between people. He never instigated anyone. He was on a call and simply tried to block a bike coming towards him… and they attacked him.""He added that his daughter had moved out after her marriage, and Shivam's death has now left the elderly couple alone with no one to look after them.","Shivam gupta, 36, died after allegedly being beaten with a helmet by two food-delivery riders during a brawl in connaught place last month.

PUNE: Political analyst Tehseen Poonawalla on Tuesday alleged that his mother, a senior citizen, was deliberately hit by a car in an hit-and-run incident in Pune, leaving her seriously injured and requiring surgery.Sharing CCTV footage of the incident on social media platform X, Tehseen said his mother had stepped out for a drive with his driver and executive assistant and was standing by the roadside while the car was being refuelled when a vehicle allegedly struck her and fled the spot.“My mom, a senior citizen, went for a drive with my driver and executive assistant and was waiting on the side while they were tanking up gas in our car. Someone just hit her (seems deliberate) and ran away,” he wrote.In a later update, Tehseen said he had spoken to senior police officials, including the Joint Commissioner of Police and the Deputy Commissioner of Police, adding that his mother would have to undergo hip surgery and would require a rod for life.“Mom will have to undergo hip surgery and a rod for life. Very infuriating and heartbreaking,” he said, calling the incident “disgusting” and alleging that the accused either acted deliberately or chose to flee after hitting a senior citizen.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla also confirmed the incident, stating that his mother was “seriously injured” and would undergo surgery.

'Sorry Papa': Suicide Note From Three Sisters In Ghaziabad Triggers Debate On Gaming Addiction

GHAZIABAD: At 16, 14 and 12, most children are consumed by screens — scrolling endlessly or immersed in online games. But few parents can imagine that this fixation could spiral into something so final, as it allegedly did for three sisters in Ghaziabad.Nishika, Prachi and Pakhi, all minors, were reportedly addicted to a Korean task-based online gaming application. Their parents had repeatedly reprimanded them over excessive gaming and had recently barred them from playing the app, sources said.What followed, investigators believe, was a silent and devastating decision.Early on Wednesday, the three sisters quietly stepped out of their bedroom. They moved to temple room's window in the flat, and opened the window. Using a chair placed near the window, the sisters allegedly climbed up and jumped one after another into the darkness below.The tragedy unfolded at around 2.15am at Bharat City Society under the Tila Mod police station limits in the Loni area.Parents found a handwritten note left behind by the sisters. The note, pasted on a glass panel, was titled “True Life Story” and bore a sad emoji. Written in Hindi-English mix, it read:“Is diari me jo kuch bhi likha hai wo sab padh lo kyunki ye sab sach hai.Read now!!! I’m really sorry. Sorry papa.”The sisters were so deeply immersed in the Korean game that they even began addressing one another by Korean names.Assistant commissioner of police Atul Kumar Singh said the Police Response Vehicle received information around 2.15am that three girls had jumped from a ninth-floor apartment. “On reaching the spot, it was confirmed that Nishika (16), Prachi (14) and Pakhi (12), daughters of Chetan Kumar, had died due to the fall. They were taken by ambulance to a 50-bed hospital in Loni, where doctors declared them dead,” he said.Investigators also uncovered a troubling background. All three sisters had reportedly not attended school since the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite being 16, the eldest was enrolled only in Class 4, pointing to prolonged educational disruption and isolation.Police have sent the bodies for post-mortem examination and are analysing the handwritten note, the diary referred to in it, and digital evidence linked to the gaming app. Officials said all aspects — including online activity, family circumstances and mental health — are being examined as part of the ongoing probe.","Three young sisters, aged 16, 14, and 12, tragically ended their lives by jumping from their ninth-floor ghaziabad apartment.

'Justice Is Crying...': Mamata Banerjee Takes EC Head On In Supreme Court Over SIR Row In Bengal

Why do in 3 months what takes 2 years, says Didi on SIR

NEW DELHI: In a dramatic twist to her agitation against the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday argued in Supreme Court against the exercise, which she has slammed as a tool of harassment. Election Commission has maintained that SIR is necessary for cleansing the voters’ list.Banerjee, a law graduate and perhaps the first CM to argue in-person before the apex court, watched for 20 minutes, as SC heard West Bengal counsel Shyam Divan on irregularities in SIR in the state. She was heard telling TMC’s Kalyan Banerjee “bolbo toh aaji (I will speak today)”.After a couple of abortive attempts to interject during the interaction between the bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Justice Vipul M Pancholi, and the EC counsel D S Naidu, she could wait no longer and said, “Sir...allow me sir. Please allow me to finish my point...The SIR process is only for deletion (of voters) and not for inclusion.”Arguing against the SIR process in West Bengal, CM Mamata Banerjee said, “(Name) mismatch not only in title... (they are deleting names of) daughter (who) after marrying goes to in-laws’ house (address shifting), why she is changing title (categorised as change in name) and using husband’s title is a mismatch.”CJI Surya Kant said these can never be grounds to delete names. Banerjee replied, “Some daughters who shifted to in-laws’ house, their names (were) deleted. It is all unilateral. People who are transferred or shifted address... they are kept in logical discrepancy (list). They (EC) violated... Can they violate SC order? Bengal people were so happy when SC ordered that Aadhaar card would be one of the documents. But they are not implementing it. They do not allow genuine documents. Only Bengal is targeted.”Banerjee — accused by BJP of opposing the SIR process to protect Bangladeshi infiltrators who have registered as voters in poll-bound Bengal — argued for the postponement of the revision exercise. “SIR is being conducted after 24 years... What is the hurry? What takes two years, why is it being done in three months. Festival season, harvesting season... when people are not in a mood to stay in the city and (want to) go to their homes, at that time they are issuing notices,” she said.She also alleged that over 100 people, including BLOs “died due to SIR”. “More than 100 people died, sir. BLOs died and they have written letter saying CEO (state chief electoral officer) is responsible for my suicide. More than 100 people died and so many were hospitalised. West Bengal is (being) harassed. Why not Assam,” she asked.EC counsel Naidu interrupted Mamata, saying there is no cooperation from the state govt. CJI stopped him and said, “Ma’am has come all the way to say something.”“Ma’am Mamata, let me clarify a few things to you. About the Aadhaar card, SIR validity issue was argued for more than two months and judgment is reserved. Therefore, we cannot comment about credibility, credential and admissibility to what extent of Aadhaar card. You will also appreciate that the Aadhaar card has its own limitation when you read the statute in that regard. At the same time, issue about its insertion in the Representation of the People Act, what will be its value, we are yet to determine that,” the CJI said.“Second, you have pointed out the discrepancy part, one solution can be, you depute responsible officers to EC, who can be tasked to verify documents — whether it is a spelling mistake because of translation from Bengali. It must be rectified,” he said.Mamata alleged that electoral registration officers have no power and they (EC) have superseded the powers of all poll officers.",Mamata banerjee is perhaps the first cm to argue in-person before the supreme court.

PRAYAGRAJ: After decades of waiting, Dhani Ram finally won his freedom in his 100th year. Allahabad high court last month acquitted the Hamirpur native, convicted in 1984 for a 1982 murder tied to a property feud.Though sentenced to life, he was released on bail that same year, spending 42 years waiting for finality while his appeal crawled through the docket.A division bench of Justices Chandra Dhari Singh and Sanjiv Kumar, in a 23-page ruling dated Jan 21, tore into contradictions they found in the prosecution’s case — from unreliable testimony of two eyewitnesses to omissions in FIR and what the court called “inherent improbabilities.”With main accused Maiku absconding since 1982 and allegedly the one who fired the fatal shot, the judges said the prosecution had failed to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.When a person stands before the court at the twilight of existence, the insistence on penal consequences, after decades of procedural delay, risks transforming justice into a ritual divorced from the purpose it intends,” the bench wrote, adding that prolonged anxiety, uncertainty and social fallout “cannot be ignored” when deciding what justice now requires.Dhani Ram and co-accused Satti Din had been convicted under IPC sections 302 read with 34 for accompanying Maiku during the killing.Satti Din died during his own pending appeal, leaving Dhani Ram the lone surviving appellant.His counsel said he was only accused of exhortation, not firing any shot. State counsel opposed the acquittal.The Allahabad high court ruled that the benefit of doubt must go to the centenarian. With acquittal granted, his bail bond stands discharged.","Allahabad high court last month acquitted the hamirpur native, convicted in 1984 for a 1982 murder tied to a property feud.

There’s LOC against Anil Ambani, court told

NEW DELHI: Industrialist Anil Ambani on Wednesday gave an undertaking to the Supreme Court through his lawyer that he would not flee India pending court-monitored CBI and ED probes into alleged siphoning of Rs 40,000 crore from loans availed of from banks.With petitioner EAS Sarma’s counsel Prashant Bhushan apprehending that given the spread and size of the fraud, the principal accused may leave the country, a bench of CJI Surya Kant, Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi said, “We don’t want any such thing to happen.”When the bench told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who was representing both CBI and ED, to take preventive steps to ensure that investigation into the alleged fraud was not impeded, Mehta said that there was a look out circular (LOC) against Ambani, indicating that any attempt to flee the country would be foiled at the airport.Ambani’s counsel Mukul Rohatgi said, “There are many LOCs against him. But in the last three years, two ADAG companies have paid back Rs 20,000 crore to the banks. If he was to flee the country, why would he repay such huge amounts?”When Rohatgi assured the SC that Ambani would not leave the country without prior permission of the court, Mehta cautioned Rohatgi and reminded him that despite similar undertaking given by him on behalf of another client, that person had fled the country.The bench recorded the SG’s assurance that “all preventive/remedial measures would be taken to ensure that the ongoing investigations are not impeded”.The bench took exception to CBI registering only one FIR on SBI’s complaint against ADAG and adding similar loan amount siphoning complaints from other banks and financial institutions to the SBI FIR.“Each loan taken is a separate agreement. The modus operandi may be similar but violation of each agreement is a separate offence. Why would CBI not register separate FIRs?” the bench asked. Mehta said CBI would examine this issue and register separate FIRs if needed.The bench also found it strange that CBI was awaiting sanctions to investigate bank officials who were in collusion with ADAG officials in the alleged defrauding of banks through siphoning of loan amounts. It directed CBI to investigate all such bank officials involved in the crime, ignoring any legal impediment on that score. The SC said it would continue to monitor the CBI and ED probes and asked the two agencies to file a fresh status report in four weeks.The petition, filed through advocate Pranav Sachdeva, alleged that ADAG companies — Reliance Communications , Reliance Infratel and Reliance Telecom — cumulatively received loans of Rs 31,850 crore from a consortium of public sector banks led by State Bank of India between 2013-17.SBI’s deputy GM Jyoti Kumar registered an FIR on Aug 21 alleging “conspiracy, cheating, criminal breach of trust and criminal misconduct by Reliance Communications, Anil Ambani and other individuals resulting in a loss of Rs 2,929 crore”, the petitioner said, adding that the FIR was based on the report of a forensic audit of financial transactions of the three ADAG companies for the period 2013-17, which was commissioned by SBI in 2019.The ED, in its affidavit, informed the SC that it has so far registered three PMLA FIRs (ECIRs) against ADAG companies, searched 46 premises, issued 305 summonses, attached 204 properties worth Rs 12,000 crore and arrested four persons. Under Fema, it has attached properties worth Rs 78 crore, it said.","Anil ambani gave an undertaking to the supreme court through his lawyer that he would not flee india pending court-monitored cbi and ed probes. Solicitor general tushar mehta said that there was a look out circular (loc) against ambani, indicating that any attempt to flee the country would be foiled.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127918676,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-26906,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

'Justice Is Crying...': Mamata Banerjee Takes EC Head On In Supreme Court Over SIR Row In Bengal

NEW DELHI: Election Commission on Wednesday sought Supreme Court’s urgent intervention to curb and prevent, what it called, a systematic pattern of violence and threats against its officials conducting the special intensive revision of electoral rolls in West Bengal and alleged that while the CM’s speeches encouraged such situations, police are reluctant to register FIRs against the perpetrators.Comparing smooth conduct of SIR in other states to that in Bengal where those involved in the roll revision have been “targeted”, EC, in its affidavit, said, “It unequivocally illustrates that the challenges encountered in West Bengal are not intrinsic to the SIR process itself, but are a direct result of the inadequacies of the state machinery and the prevailing climate of political interference therein.”“This singular and alarming breakdown demands immediate intervention of SC to safeguard the integrity of the electoral process,” it said, adding “the CM has persistently delivered a series of public addresses that are inherently provocative, thereby engendering an atmosphere of intimidation among election officials”.EC claimed that on Jan 14 the CM, during a press conference, “engaged in fear mongering, disseminated misleading and erroneous information regarding the SIR process, overtly threatened and targeted poll officials, and sought to incite alarm among the electorate”.“The CM explicitly identified and targeted a micro-observer Hari Das, thereby publicly isolating an election official performing statutory duties and subjecting him to unwarranted pressure and intimidation...gravely compromising the independence, neutrality and safety of election officials,” the poll panel said on a day when CM Mamata Banerjee argued against the roll revision in SC.As a result, nine micro-observers in Murshidabad constituency collectively wrote to the West Bengal chief electoral officer (CEO), formally withdrawing from the SIR process due to violent assaults perpetrated by miscreants and inadequate security provisions, it said, adding on Jan 15, a mob of 700 attacked the place where SIR work was being carried out in Uttar Dinajpur district.Complaining that police authorities are reluctant to register FIRs on complaints lodged by booth level officers (BLOs), EC said, “In certain instances, FIRs were documented only subsequent to intervention by the district election officer, with arrests occurring belatedly thereafter.” It said other state police have promptly registered FIRs on complaints by EC officials.Given the ground situation, the Centre has provided ‘Y+ security’ cover to the WB CEO, the only officer among his peers in all states to get such security cover, EC said.","Election commission sought supreme court’s urgent intervention to curb and prevent violence and threats against its officials in west bengal.

SC asks govt to produce original files on Wangchuk’s detention

NEW DELHI: Observing that the medical condition of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk , who has been in detention for more than four months, is not very good, Supreme Court asked the Centre Wednesday to rethink/relook its decision to continue to keep him in custody, reports Amit Anand Choudhary.SC had earlier directed authorities to conduct Wangchuk’s medical examination by a specialised doctor and file a report before it. The activist is currently lodged in Jodhpur jail. The medical report was placed before the apex court during the last hearing.Wangchuk was detained on Sept 26 last year under the National Security Act following protests in Leh over demands of statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh. SC is hearing the plea moved by Wangchuk’s wife Gitanjali Angmo against his preventive detention.Apart from submissions, counter submissions and law points, just give a thought to it, as an officer of the court. The detention order was passed on Sept 26, 2025, nearly five months have passed. Considering the health condition of the detainee… which is certainly not very good.There are certain age-related, may be otherwise. Is there a possibility for the govt to rethink, have a relook?” the bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and P B Varale asked.Additional solicitor general K M Natraj told the bench he will take instruction and will brief the court on the next date of hearing.The bench also directed the govt to place before it original files related to Wangchuk’s detention and the process adopted by the govt. Nataraj submitted that the govt had nothing to hide, and will place the documents.The additional solicitor general submitted that the speech given by Sonam Wangchuk on Sept 24 last year was so provocative that it eventually led to the violent protest, which claimed the lives of four people.“Four people died in the incident, and 161 were injured. I will place the materials. Ultimately, it was his provocative speech, his instigation, which led to violence. The person needs not to be actively participating in it. It is the propensity of the person to influence the group of people or to commit somebody else to do a violent act which is relevant. That is more than sufficient for prevention detention,” he submitted.“It (NSA) is only a preventive law. It is only to prevent somebody from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order or security of the state. Preventive detention is not punitive detention. It has to be necessarily left to the discretion of the executing authority. It is purely discretionary,” he said.Earlier, the govt had told the court that the activist was trying to create political and social turmoil and unrest in Ladakh, and was making an attempt to emulate what happened in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal.",Supreme court asks centre to review sonam wangchuk’s detention.

Banerjee vs EC over SIR row

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee 's long-running standoff with the Election Commission over the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls escalated after the serving CM personally attended the Supreme Court hearing on Wednesday, urging it to intervene to ""save democracy. ""Mamata challenged the ongoing SIR exercise in the state, alleging that West Bengal was being ""targeted"" and its people were being ""bulldozed"" through the revision process.The TMC supremo reached the Supreme Court from the residence of her party colleague and nephew, Abhishek Banerjee.As the Supreme Court began hearing her plea, Mamata questioned why the same standards were not being applied in other states such as Assam.""West Bengal is being targeted,"" she told the bench, adding that when justice is ""crying behind closed doors"", it creates a feeling that justice is not being delivered anywhere.""They are targeting West Bengal to bulldoze its people,"" Mamata said, after being allowed by the bench to supplement the submissions of her counsel, senior advocate Shyam Divan.""We are not getting justice anywhere. I have written six letters to the Election Commission,"" she said, seeking relief from the court.At the end of the hearing, she thanked the bench for the opportunity to argue and again appealed to it to ""save democracy"".In her petition, Mamata has challenged the SIR exercise in West Bengal and sought directions to scrap the EC’s revision drive, rely on existing electoral rolls, stop deletions, ease verification of names and accept Aadhaar as a valid document.Appearing for Banerjee, senior advocate Shyam Divan told the court that only four days remained for completion of the exercise, which is scheduled to conclude on February 14.He said around 32 lakh voters remained unmapped, while about 1.36 crore names were listed under ""logical discrepancies"". Hearings were still pending in nearly 63 lakh cases, he added.Divan explained that logical discrepancies included issues such as mismatches in parents’ names and cases where the age gap between a voter and a parent was less than 15 years or more than 50 years. He also alleged that approved documents such as domicile certificates, Aadhaar cards and OBC certificates were being rejected, forcing voters to stand in queues for four to five hours.Mamata herself alleged that Aadhaar was not being accepted and claimed that many living persons had been wrongly declared dead during the revision process.Taking note of the plea and the unusual arguments advanced by a sitting chief minister, the Supreme Court observed that ""genuine persons must remain on the electoral roll"".Chief Justice Surya Kant, heading the bench along with Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi, said electoral roll revision can involve issues of migration but stressed that no innocent voter should be excluded.""Every problem has a solution and we must ensure that no innocent person is left out,"" the CJI said.The court issued formal notices to the Election Commission and the chief electoral officer of West Bengal, seeking their replies by February 9, and listed the matter for hearing on that date.Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for the Election Commission, countered Mamata’s allegations and claimed that the West Bengal government had provided only 80 grade-two officers such as SDMs to oversee the SIR process.He said only low-ranked government employees like Anganwadi workers have been provided by the West Bengal government for the process.Mamata rejected the charge, saying the state government had provided whatever assistance the poll panel had sought.Earlier on January 19, the Supreme Court had issued a series of directions, stressing that the SIR process should be transparent and not cause inconvenience.It had directed the EC to display lists of voters with ""logical discrepancies"" at gram panchayat bhavans and block offices and allow submission of documents and objections there.Mamata has repeatedly attacked the EC over the exercise, warning that it could lead to ""mass disenfranchisement"" and ""strike at the foundations of democracy"".In a January 3 letter to Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, she described the process as ""arbitrary and flawed"" and accused the EC of presiding over an ""unplanned, ill-prepared and ad hoc"" exercise marked by ""serious irregularities, procedural violations and administrative lapses"".Earlier this week, Mamata travelled to Delhi and met the CEC to press her objections. According to sources quoted by ANI, the meeting ended abruptly after she ""raised false allegations, misbehaved, thumped the table and left"".Mamata, however, said she was ""humiliated"" during the meeting.As part of her campaign against the SIR, Mamata has also called for the impeachment of the chief election commissioner and sought support from other opposition parties.Congress leader K C Venugopal backed the TMC supremo's call for impeachment, saying the opposition was ""positively"" considering moving a motion against Chief Election Commissioner.Speaking to mediapersons in the Parliament House complex, Venugopal said that, ""I think the entire opposition will take a call on the matter. We are positively looking at it,"" he said.Leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, however, declined to comment on the issue.","'justice is crying...': mamata banerjee takes ec head on in supreme court over sir row in bengal.

JAMMU: A Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) commander was among three terrorists killed in separate gunfights with security forces in snow-covered forests of Udhampur and Kishtwar districts in J&K’s Jammu division Wednesday, officials said.Sources identified the slain JeM man as Rubani, alias Abu Mavia, though there was no official confirmation of his identity by authorities. Security forces launched a seek-and-shoot operation Tuesday in Jopher forest near Basantgarh — a mountainous area of Udhampur district about 65km northeast of Jammu city — acting on specific intelligence inputs.“Heavy exchange of fire rocked the forest around 4pm Tuesday when the terrorists attempted to break out of the cordon,” an official said. Reinforcements, including paratroopers and dog squads, were rushed in to seal escape routes across the rugged terrain.For several hours overnight, troops maintained a tight vigil using drones and ground surveillance before launching a final assault at daybreak. Both terrorists were killed in the morning operation, officials said.In Dichhar area of Kishtwar district, a suspected Pakistani terrorist was killed Wednesday evening in a running hunt across snowbound mountains.The Army’s White Knight Corps said on X the action followed renewed contact with terrorists on the run. Forces have pursued the group since Jan 18, when a clash broke out at Sonnar village near Mandral–Singhpora — hill hamlets south of Kishtwar town — killing a paratrooper and wounding seven soldiers. Terrorists slipped away through dense vegetation and broken ridgelines.Search teams had been combing Sanjinala–Dichhar axis inside Chingam forest, part of the Chatroo belt — a rugged stretch of terrain roughly 190km northeast of Jammu. The area has remained under deep snow for weeks.They were intercepted again several km away on Jan 22. Contact broke. Two more gunfights followed on Jan 26 and Jan 31 as snowfall crossed two feet across upper reaches, slowing movement but not search grids.","Sources identified the slain jem man as rubani, alias abu mavia.

JAMMU: The crucial talks between the Ladakh leadership and the high-powered home ministry committee ended without any conclusion in New Delhi on Wednesday, with the Ladakhi representatives hoping for another meeting soon.“The Apex Body Leh and the Kargil Democratic Alliance today held a meeting with the committee headed by MoS Home Nityanand Rai.

Since the talks are continuing, we do not want to delve into it further,” he said.Asgar Ali Karbali, co-chairman of the Kargil Democratic Alliance, said detailed deliberations were held on statehood and the sixth schedule. “Before holding talks on these issues, we raised the issue of four youths who were ‘martyred’ in September last year and those who have been detained,"" he said.“We sought the release of Sonam Wangchuk and others and said allegations against them are baseless. We also sought dignified compensation for the families of those killed in the violence,” he said, adding that the discussions continued for about two-and-a-half hours. “We hope the next meeting will be held in 15 days. We are neither satisfied nor hopeless.”The first round of talks between the committee and Ladakhi representatives was held on Oct 22, 2025, in New Delhi. Ladakh was represented by the LAB and the KDA, which are amalgam of political and religious groups from the Leh and Kargil regions, respectively.The first round of the talks took place after the Centre ordered an inquiry into the Sept 24 police firing on protesters in Leh who were demanding statehood and sixth schedule status for the union territory. Four protesters were killed in the firing. After the commission was set up, the LAB and the KDA agreed to begin talks with the Centre, leading to the Oct 22 meeting.Later, on Nov 14, the LAB and the KDA submitted a 29-page joint draft proposal to the home ministry seeking statehood and sixth schedule.
