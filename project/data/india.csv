"25-year wait in high court, SC for finality in corruption case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/25-year-wait-in-high-court-sc-for-finality-in-corruption-case/articleshow/128369165.cms,"NEW DELHI: For decades, the SC has lamented the erosion of public faith in judiciary because of the slow pace of justice delivery, especially for common citizens. This week, it closed a corruption case that had dragged on for nearly 32 years - six years in trial court, 14 years in HC and 11 years in SC, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.The case related to the alleged siphoning of 400 cement bags meant for the public works division at Aurangabad on March 24, 1994. The trial court convicted the accused six years later on Apr 3, 2000. To concur with the trial court's decision, the Bombay HC took more than 14 years.On appeal, the case remained pending for a decade in the SC before getting listed for final hearing before a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan, which reserved the verdict on Aug 21 last year. On Friday, after nearly six months, Justice Mahadevan pronounced the judgment acquitting the accused.Justice Mahadevan said, “Both the trial court and the high court held that the appellants (accused) failed to furnish any satisfactory explanation or documentary justification for such possession (of cement bags). These findings are essentially factual and are supported by the evidence on record.”Despite the evidence against the accused, the bench of Justices Nagarathna and Mahadevan acquitted the accused saying the prosecution charged them under provisions of Essential Commodities Act when on the date of siphoning off cement, it was not a commodity covered under that law.“That said, this was a case where the investigating agency ought to have invoked appropriate provisions of the Indian Penal Code, having regard to the nature of the allegations and the evidence collected,” it said and acquitted the accused saying, “The lapse, therefore, lies squarely at the door of the investigating agency.”","The case related to the alleged siphoning of 400 cement bags meant for the public works division at aurangabad.

Absconders can't get anticipatory bail: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/absconders-cant-get-anticipatory-bail-sc/articleshow/128369080.cms,"NEW DELHI: The SC has directed all high courts not to grant anticipatory bail to accused persons who abscond and later, after their co-accused are acquitted on completion of trial, approach constitutional courts seeking protection from arrest.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and Vijay Bishnoi set aside the Madhya Pradesh HC order that granted anticipatory bail to the absconding accused, directed him to surrender and apply for regular bail. It frowned upon the HC's direction to the trial court to grant bail on the day the accused moves the bail plea.Justice Bishnoi, who wrote the judgment, said, “An absconder is not entitled to the relief of anticipatory bail as a general rule, however, in certain exceptional cases, where on a perusal of the FIR, case diary and other relevant materials on record, the court is of the prima facie opinion that no case is made out against the absconding accused, then the power of granting anticipatory bail may be exercised.”The court noted that the accused was part of a mob who had not only fled but also threatened to kill an injured person for opposing his bail plea. The bench said the acquittal of the co-accused thus could not be grounds to grant him anticipatory bail as he had failed to cooperate with probe and delayed the trial.“Granting the relief of anticipatory bail... sets a bad precedent and sends a message that the law-abiding co-accused persons who stood trial were wrong to diligently attend the process of trial and further, incentivises people to evade the process of law with impunity,” the SC said.The bench directed the accused to surrender before the trial court within four weeks and seek regular bail.",The sc has directed all high courts not to grant anticipatory bail to accused persons who abscond.

Cabinet OKs India’s 1st underwater road-cum-rail tunnel in Assam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cabinet-oks-indias-1st-underwater-road-cum-rail-tunnel-in-assam/articleshow/128368829.cms,"PM Modi Opens Kumar Bhaskar Varma Setu, Rs 3000 Crore Bridge Cuts Guwahati Travel Time To 7 Minutes

NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet has approved infrastructure projects worth over Rs 31,000 crore, including construction of the country’s first road-cum-rail tunnel under the Brahmaputra in Assam. The twin-tube common tunnel with approach roads for movement of vehicles and trains, only the second in the world, would cost Rs 18,662 crore.It will connect Gohpur and Numaligarh in Assam and will cut travel time from about 6 hours to just 20 minutes. The project, to be fully funded by govt, will not just reduce the travel distance from 240 km to roughly 34 km improving connectivity but also has strategic significance, I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said while announcing the Cabinet decision. This four-lane tunnel will ensure high-speed connectivity to Arunachal and provide “strategic resilience” for defence purposes. The minister said the twin tubes would be interconnected at intervals of 500 metres.Officials said the tunnel would be built around 32 metres beneath the Brahmaputra’s lowest bed level. One of the tubes will have provision for a single rail track and no vehicular movement will be allowed when trains run through this tube.PM Modi called the Brahmaputra tunnel project as a “landmark boost to connectivity in the northeast”.In a post on X, he said, “...This transformative project will enhance connectivity, reduce logistics costs and accelerate growth across Assam and the entire Northeast.”TOI has learnt that originally govt had included the connectivity between Gohpur and Numaligarh as a part of the Special Accelerated Road Development Programme for North East in 2008 by constructing a bridge. But later a proposal was mooted to build a road tunnel beneath the Brahmaputra. Later, it was modified to have a common tunnel for both vehicles and trains.A similar 22-km road-cumrail tunnel passing through Chicken Neck corridor in the northeast is also in planning stage. Besides the tunnel, Cabinet approved three NH projects with a combined cost of over Rs 11,000 crore — a 107.7-km fourlane highway in Gujarat, a 154.6-km highway stretch in Maharashtra and an 80-km corridor of NH-167 in Telangana.In rail sector, three multitracking projects covering 12 districts across Delhi, Haryana, Maharashtra and Karnataka were approved at an estimated cost of Rs 18,509 crore. The approved projects will add 389 km to the existing network of railways. Multitracking works are scheduled for completion by March 2031. These include the laying of third and fourth line between Kasara and Manmad in Maharashtra, which will have the second longest tunnel on the rail network.","The twin-tube common tunnel with approach roads for movement of vehicles and trains, only the second in the world, would cost rs 18,662 crore.

PM Modi lands on North-East's 1st highway airstrip in Assam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-lands-on-north-easts-1st-highway-airstrip-in-assam/articleshow/128368671.cms,"PM Modi Makes Historic Landing At Dibrugarh ELF, Rafale And Sukhoi Jets Mark India's Strategic Push

DIBRUGARH/GUWAHATI: PM Narendra Modi landed on the North-East’s first emergency landing facility, a highway airstrip at Moran in Assam’s Dibrugarh district, and rolled out a package of infrastructure projects worth more than Rs 5,500 crore across the pollbound state, spanning defence preparedness, connectivity, education and digital capacity.Modi flew in from Chabua airfield on Saturday aboard an IAF C-130J, touching down on the 4.2km-long specially reinforced stretch of the Moran bypass built at a cost of Rs 100 crore. Designed for dual civil-military use, the emergency landing facility doubles as a national highway and can serve as a backup to Dibrugarh airport during natural disasters or conflict.Officials said the strip can handle fighter aircraft up to 40 tonnes and transport planes up to 74 tonnes maximum take-off weight, strengthening rapid de-ployment and relief operations in a sensitive region close to the Chinese border.The Prime Minister’s landing was followed by a 40-minute IAF aerial display underscoring the strip’s operational readiness. Sukhoi Su-30MKI and Rafale fighters conducted takeoffs and landings, An-32 transports showcased short-field operations, and advanced light helicopters simulated humanitarian assistance and disaster relief missions. Garud Commandos rappelled onto the strip in a demonstration.Later in Guwahati, Modi inaugurated the Kumar Bhaskar Varma Setu, a six-lane, 7.75km concrete bridge over the Brahmaputra built at a cost of Rs 3,030 crore.The bridge, the first of its kind in the North-east, cuts travel time between Guwahati and North Guwahati to about seven minutes from roughly 30 minutes via the Saraighat bridge. Designed for high seismicity, it uses friction pendulum bearings and a real-time bridge health monitoring system. Modi had laid the foundation stone in Feb 2019.At Lachit Ghat, the PM unveiled the temporary campus of IIM Guwahati, the region’s second IIM and India’s 22nd. The Rs 555-crore permanent campus will be built at Palasbari near Guwahati, with classes beginning from a transit campus at Tech City, Bongora, under mentorship of IIM Ahmedabad.He also inaugurated NE’s National Data Centre at Amingaon in Kamrup, a Rs 348-crore facility with an 8.5-MW sanctioned load and advanced rack capacity to host mission-critical govt applications and serve as a disaster recovery hub under Digital India. A fleet of electric buses and other connectivity projects were also launched.","Pm modi makes historic landing at dibrugarh elf, rafale and sukhoi jets mark india's strategic push.modi flew in from chabua airfield on saturday aboard an iaf c-130j, touching down on the 4.2km-long specially reinforced stretch of the moran bypass.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128368745,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-80758,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
Consumer forums can’t be sinecures for retired judges: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/consumer-forums-cant-be-sinecures-for-retd-judges-sc/articleshow/128363327.cms,"‘Justice Delayed Is Justice Destroyed’: CJI Kant Calls High Courts Key Guardians Of Citizens’ Rights

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has taken exception to district and state consumer forums fast becoming sinecures for retired district and HC judges and admitted that the apex court had passed sweeping orders in the past for activating these forums without realising the pendency of cases in these institutions.A district consumer forum is headed by a retired district judge, and a state consumer disputes redressal commission (SCDRC) is headed by a retired HC judge. Most northeastern states and Union territories have complained that there is little work for the commissions and setting them up in full strength will be a drain on the exchequer.Arunachal Pradesh informed a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi on Feb 11 that it has a total of 59 consumer cases pending in district and state consumer forums. It said that it has advertised for post of president of the state consumer forum, but no retired judge is interested in taking up the assignment.A similar story emerged from other northeastern states and UTs. Sikkim has a total pendency of 64 consumer cases — 52 in district forums and 12 in state forum; Mizoram has 82 cases in district forums and 12 in state forum; Manipur has 123 cases in district forums and 43 in state forum; Lakshadweep has a total of 10 cases; Andaman and Nicobar islands has 37 cases in district forum and four in state forum; and Goa has a total pendency of 39 consumer cases.The bench agreed that creating separate district and state forums in states where pendency of consumer cases is low casts an unnecessary burden on the exchequer and the assignment becomes a sinecure for retired judicial officers and retired HC judges.Reflecting on past orders on the issue by SC, the CJI-led bench said, “We are also fond of issuing sweeping directions without realising the ground realities. The presidents of district consumer forums are on a par with district judges but look at the workload of the two. The district judges are overburdened whereas the consumer forums in these states have no work. Why should the president of a district forum be equated with a district judge?”Seeking data from all states on pendency of cases before district forums, the bench decided to deal with the state commissions in seven states/UTs where pendency is low and transferred the pending cases to the HCs concerned.It said the HC chief justice would assign consumer forum work to one of the judges, who would act as president of the forum and hear the cases along with members of the state forum. Those aggrieved by their orders could file an appeal before National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), the bench said. “States and UTs where pendency of consumer cases are less than 1,000 can submit an alternative proposal for the purpose of providing a mechanism to redress grievances of consumer complaints,” the bench said as some states wanted to appoint part-time members to district consumer forums.",District and state consumer forums fast becoming sinecures for retired district and hc judges.

"Divided by conflict, Meiteis and Kukis unite on a football field",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/divided-by-conflict-meiteis-and-kukis-unite-on-a-football-field/articleshow/128361924.cms,"IMPHAL: In villages across the foothills near western Imphal, young men have spent nearly three years taking turns through the night, standing at the edge of their settlements with sticks and torches after elders decided vigilance was no longer optional. In Kuki villages, night patrols began almost immediately after clashes erupted on May 3, 2023. In Naga-majority ones, they intensified after tensions flared in Litan this week.Some of these youngsters were brought to Assam Rifles' New Keithelmanbi Garrison earlier this week after finishing guard duty that morning, reports Vishant Agarwala. They are footballers. From Monday to Thursday, 13 teams - eight Naga, three Meitei and two Kuki - from nearby villages gathered at the garrison's uneven, dusty football ground for Assam Rifles' Foothills Football Tournament, organised under Operation Sadbhavana.Keithelmanbi lies along the seam where the Imphal Valley rises into the surrounding hills, a geography that has hardened into buffer zones and guarded perimeters. The teams were named after nearby villages. But even a distance of 4km can carry more meaning than it suggests.The Kuki teams - including Haibung FC which reached Thursday's final - crossed the buffer zone for the first time since May 2023 in Assam Rifles buses with guards.Football has often mirrored deeper fractures within societies already under strain. The 1990 clash between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade came to symbolise Yugoslavia unravelling. The so-called ""Football War"" between El Salvador and Honduras in 1969 entered history as an example of how a match can ignite terrain already primed for conflict. In those instances, football did not invent grievance, it amplified it.In Keithelmanbi, football was asked to restrain.The organisers approached the tournament with caution. Senior Assam Rifles officers addressed the teams before kickoff and made the terms clear: play in the spirit of the sport; any attempt to injure an opponent would result in an immediate red card; an extremely severe offence would lead to disqualification of the entire team.""Refereeing is always contentious, so we used soldiers from outside the northeast,"" an officer told TOI. Security personnel lined the perimeter. From the commentary area, a Hindi voice narrated play and returned to one appeal whenever tackles grew heavy: ""Khel ki sadbhavana banaye rakhein. Referee ke nirnay ka paalan karein."" Maintain the game's spirit. Referee's decision is final.The first semifinal at 8am on Wednesday featured two 100% Meitei teams - New Keithelmanbi Team B and KTYWA Keinou. The second carried a heavier backdrop. Khonglong Naga Youth Club faced Haibung FC.Days earlier, violence had flared between Kukis and Nagas about 100km away in Litan in Ukhrul district. Though Khonglong's village had not suffered direct damage, anxiety spread quickly. Naga youngsters too began night patrols. Families hesitated before allowing the team travel. ""People were worried,"" one Khonglong player said. ""But if we stop meeting completely, that is not good for the future.""On the pitch, there was no spillover. Haibung dominated in a largely one-sided contest. When the match ended, the handshake was steady and unforced. It set up a final few had predicted - the first Kuki-Meitei football match since May 3, 2023.Haibung's story explains why reaching the final carried weight beyond sport. The squad's average age is 19. Instead of focusing on training, many found themselves playing night sentries. ""For our own safety,"" one said. ""That doesn't mean we want to fight another community.""""We don't sleep properly on those days,"" another player said quietly. ""But it is our responsibility."" They were excused from duty for the duration of the tournament.Haibung coach Ngamgoulen (30) had returned from Delhi, where he had been preparing for the Manipur civil services exams, on April 28, 2023. Within weeks, his village was attacked five times. His cousin Nilson Kuki's house burned down. Movement became restricted. Reaching the nearest airport required crossing a buffer zone. With routes to Imphal airport blocked, residents travelled via Aizawl or Dimapur.Gogo, as he is known, did not leave his village. ""As the younger brother of the village chief, it was my duty to be there for my people."" His belongings remain in Delhi.Haibung defender Seiminthang Haokip (20) now lives in a relief camp after his village was burned down twice and is still waiting for the next stage of his Territorial Army application. Fullback Thangkhopao Singsit (21) had been preparing for CDS examinations when his village was attacked in July 2023, leaving three villagers dead and one still missing.Goalkeeper Chongouman Kipgen (21) ran a private school with his father that employed teachers from Meitei, Kuki, Naga and smaller tribes, and they were in the process of starting another school before the conflict made coexistence impossible. Midfielder Thangminsei Kipgen (19) teaches at the only functioning community-run school in the area, managed by Kuki Students' Organisation, after most qualified teachers left the state.By the time the final began, the stands were full. Villagers had been brought in Army vehicles under armed escort, joining elders and locals. Senior Assam Rifles officers were present.The first half was intense. New Keithelmanbi was in control. By halftime, the Meitei side had built a 3-0 lead. Haibung regrouped during the break and scored two goals soon after the match resumed. Midway through the second half, a tackle triggered protests and brief shoves before Assam Rifles personnel intervened. The commentator's reminder - ""khel ki sadbhavana banaye rakhein"" - returned. The game concluded 5-2 in favour of New Keithelmanbi. There were five yellow cards in the match.When the final whistle blew, players formed a line and shook hands without hesitation. The exchange was brief and routine. ""We just played,"" one said afterwards.Security personnel remained until the teams dispersed. The Meitei side returned toward the valley. Haibung FC boarded Assam Rifles buses and travelled across the buffer zone under armed escort - to villages where night patrols would resume.","Assam rifles' foothills football tournament held at new keithelmanbi garrison. 13 teams - eight naga, three meitei and two kuki - from nearby villages took part. It was the first kuki-meitei football match since may 3, 2023.

And what kind of policy is this? Is this really any kind of choice, or is it a trap designed to push us into a ‘well in front, ditch behind’ situation?” he asked.“If we import American cotton, our own farmers will be ruined. If we don’t import it, our textile industry will lag behind and get destroyed,” Gandhi claimed.Highlighting the importance of textile industry and cotton farming, he said that “attacking these sectors means pushing millions of families into the pit of unemployment and economic crisis.”He further said, “A visionary govt that thinks in the national interest would have negotiated a deal that protects and ensures the prosperity of both cotton farmers and textile exporters.

JAMMU: J&K Police and BSF troopers seized on Saturday over 6kg of heroin, worth Rs 40 crore and suspected to have been dropped by a Pakistani drone, near the international border in Jammu’s RS Pura.“Following information about a drone dropping material from across the border, a joint operation by troopers of 165th battalion of BSF and J&K Police was launched.

94.5% kids survive after cancer treatment: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/94-5-kids-survive-after-cancer-treatment-study/articleshow/128361861.cms,"NEW DELHI: For thousands of families across India, the words ""cancer-free"" mark relief and new beginnings. But what happens after treatment ends has, until now, remained largely undocumented in the country.On the eve of International Childhood Cancer Day, researchers released findings from India's first large, national childhood cancer survivorship programme, tracking more than 5,400 children who completed treatment across 20 centres, including in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Bengaluru.Launched in 2016 by Indian Paediatric Haematology Oncology Group, the Indian Childhood Cancer Survivorship study is published in 'The Lancet Regional Health - Southeast Asia'. Lead author Dr Rachna Seth, chief of the oncology division in the department of paediatrics at AIIMS, New Delhi, said the idea was conceptualised in 2014 and became operational by 2016. The analysis includes data from 2016 to 2024.""For years, the focus was only on acute care - that children should survive,"" she said. ""But now we know many do survive, and they have decades of life ahead of them. What matters next is how they live after treatment.""The early findings are encouraging. The five-year overall survival rate stands at 94.5%, while event-free survival is at 89.9%. Two years after treatment, the survival rate rises to 98.2%. As of Dec 2024, follow-up data was available for 5,140 children, with 92% alive and in remission.Leukaemia accounted for 41% of cases, making it the most common diagnosis in the cohort. Hodgkin lymphoma, bone tumours and retinoblastoma were also among the leading cancers treated. Nearly all children received chemotherapy, about one in four underwent radiotherapy, nearly one-third required surgery and more than half needed blood transfusions.Seth said survivors may face long-term medical and psychosocial challenges, including fertility concerns, cardiac dysfunction, cognitive issues, relapse and second cancers. ""These late effects need to be systematically captured. Until now, we were largely extrapolating from Western data. India had none,"" she said.While the published analysis covers 20 centres, nearly 35 to 36 centres are now contributing data. ""This gives us our own baseline,"" Seth said.The median follow-up period so far is 3.9 years from diagnosis. About 5.7% experienced relapse and 4.9% died during follow-up.","Researchers release findings from india's first large, national childhood cancer survivorship programme.

BLO supervisors, for whom EC has fixed an honorarium of Rs 20,000, have not been paid at all. Chakravarty has now been directed to immediately release the pending amount.The poll panel also asked Chakravarty to comply with its directives dated 05.08.2025 for registration of FIRs against two electoral registration officers, two assistant EROs and one data entry operator over their alleged failure to perform their statutory duty and for violating data security policies.A reminder in this case was last sent to West Bengal on Jan 2, 2026.The commission also pressed its directive dated Jan 25 for suspension of Basirhat assistant electoral registration officer Sumitra Pratim Pradhan, who had “unauthorisedly deployed 11 additional AEROs to conduct hearing by issuing suo-motu order, in contravention of statutory provisions”.EC further directed the chief secretary to cancel transfer orders issued by state govt in respect of three electoral roll observers without consulting it.","Ec has directed west bengal chief secretary nandini chakravarty to comply with its directives regarding payment of honorarium to blos, appointment of suitable sir/poll-related officers.

Debutant PDP MLA who won Omar's seat says J&K Assembly still powerful,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/debutant-pdp-mla-who-won-omars-seat-says-jk-assembly-still-powerful/articleshow/128360811.cms,"JAMMU: PDP's Aga Syed Muntazir, who won the Budgam assembly seat vacated by Omar Abdullah in the Nov 2025 bypoll despite an intensive campaign by the CM and his Cabinet, has said his first experience in the J&K Assembly has been positive and that the House remains a powerful institution even though its powers were curtailed after abrogation of Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019, and the downgrading of Jammu and Kashmir state into a union territory.“I am hopeful that the eroded political space in J&K can be reclaimed through this institution and that people’s rights can be restored to some extent. The legitimacy people have given to the Assembly demands that it works in that spirit,” Muntazir told the TOI outside the Assembly on Friday.“We should not say the J&K Assembly is disempowered. No party or legislator should say this. We should not use discouraging words or claim that nothing can be done through this Assembly. Even in the present setup, the Assembly is a powerful institution,” he said.“After Aug 5, 2019, people gave legitimacy to this Assembly by participating in the polls in large, unprecedented numbers not seen in the past 36 years. Now you cannot tell the same people that it is a disempowered Assembly. We must strive for political rights of J&K, but at the same time the legitimacy of this Assembly shouldn’t be negated,” he added.Muntazir, 38, entered the Assembly for the first time after winning the Budgam seat, defeating National Conference candidate Aga Syed Mahmood by 4,478 votes.The bypoll defeat was a major setback for the CM who had vacated the Budgam seat in 2024 after winning from it.Muntazir is the son of Aga Syed Hasan, a senior Shia cleric and former leader of separatist conglomerate All Parties Hurriyat Conference. Muntazir earlier worked as a grassroots activist before entering electoral politics.Muntazir, who holds an LLM degree, said Budgam has suffered nearly two decades of neglect despite its proximity to Srinagar. Since joining the Assembly, he regularly raises concerns about roads, education, drinking water and healthcare in his constituency, where literacy levels remain low. “In the past 20 years, the same party (NC) represented Budgam. People were given only rhetoric, but political rhetoric has a shelf life,” he said. “The people voted for change because their dignity and basic needs were ignored for a long time.”He said the CM had earlier assured the establishment of a National Law University in Budgam and the promise was made in the House. “It must be honoured. The empowerment of the J&K Assembly lies in delivering what is promised in the House,” he said.","Pdp's aga syed muntazir won the budgam assembly seat vacated by omar abdullah in the nov 2025 bypoll despite an intensive campaign by the cm and his cabinet. “i am hopeful that the eroded political space in j&k can be reclaimed through this institution,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128368760,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1595736,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday told music composer A R Rahman to show respect to and acknowledge Junior Dagar Bandhu’s contributions to the Dhrupad tradition of Indian classical music.

He said he still held copyright over the composition by his father and his uncle.The plaintiff had said credit should be given to the Dagar Brothers when the ‘Veera Raja Veera’ version was played across all modes and mediums, including digital, internet, OTT platforms, satellite, cable television, etc.Delhi HC’s Justice Pratibha Singh had asked the existing credit line ‘Composition based on a Dagarvani Tradition Dhrupad’ be replaced with ‘Composition based on Shiva Stuti by Late Ustad Faiyazuddin Dagar, Late Ustad Zahiruddin Dagar’.The four defendants, including Rahman, were asked to deposit Rs 2 crore each, subject to outcome of the suit. A division bench of the HC had set aside the interim directions — change of credit and Rs 2 crore deposit — saying Dagar had failed to establish prima facie proof of authorship or originality of ‘Shiva Stuti’.An SC bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi told Rahman’s counsel, A M Singhvi, that the plaintiff has made out a case with regard to the originality of the composition but the issue of authorship would be examined.Both the CJI and Justice Bagchi were unequivocal about the immense contributions made by Dagar Bandhu to Indian classical music and said, “Without their and other exponents’ contributions, do you think modern singers would have survived?” SC told Singhvi “instead of going into legal niceties, you could give some respect to them.

It released status report of 21 Reras as of Feb 13.The availability of updated annual reports is crucial as these contain details of data on performance of Reras, including project completion status categorised by timely completion, completion with extensions, and incomplete projects. The ministry's format for publishing these reports also specifies providing details such as actual execution status of refund, possession and compensation orders as well as recovery warrant execution details with values and list of defaulting builders.FPCE said annual report data is not only vital for homebuyers to assess system credibility, but is equally necessary for both state and central govts to frame effective policies, design incentivisation schemes, and develop tax policy frameworks.""Unless we have credible data proving that after Rera the real estate sector has improved in terms of delivery, fairness, and keeping its promises, we are merely firing in the air,"" said FPCE president Abhay Upadhyay, who is also a member of the govt's Central Advisory Council on Rera.As per details shared by the entity, seven states - Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Goa - have never published a single annual report since Rera's implementation, and nine states, including Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Telangana, which initially published reports, have discontinued the practice.Upadhyay said when regulators themselves don't follow the law, they lose the legal right to demand compliance from other stakeholders.

Amit Shah Confident BJP Will Form Government In Kerala In 2026, Vote Share Climbing

(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday accused Congress leader V Narayanasamy of turning Puducherry into an “ATM for the Gandhi family” during his tenure as chief minister of the poll-bound Union territory.The senior BJP leader also alleged that the Narayanasamy administration “sold” PG and diploma seats, including those for reserved category candidates, to “wealthy individuals.”Narayanasamy served as chief minister from June 2016 to February 2021.“Narayanasamy’s government had turned Puducherry into an ATM for the Gandhi family. They openly auctioned PG and diploma seats and even sold the reserved seats for SC and ST to wealthy individuals for the sake of money. Transport mafias were given free rein to trouble the public,” Shah said at a public meeting in Puducherry’s Karaikal.The former BJP president added that Congress leader’s tenure as chief minister was marked by “corruption and chaos,” which the BJP — part of the All India NR Congress-led incumbent government — has worked to eliminate.He further asserted that the saffron party’s focus is now on transforming Puducherry into a developed Union territory over the next five years.“For five years, the Congress government created an environment of corruption and chaos here. In five years, we eliminated corruption and transformed chaos into order, and now it is time to transform Puducherry into a developed Puducherry in the next five years. Earlier, the decisions regarding Puducherry were taken by the Gandhi family in Delhi; now the decisions regarding Puducherry are being taken by Puducherry itself,” Shah told the gathering.Noting that the BJP-All India NR Congress alliance secured 44% of the vote in the 2021 Puducherry assembly elections, he set a target of 60% for the upcoming polls, expected in April.“PM Narendra Modi has worked to make India prosperous as well as secure. The people of Puducherry have expressed their trust in the NDA, BJP, and our leader N Rangaswamy and PM Modi. In the 2021 assembly elections, the people of Puducherry gave us 44% of the votes. This time, the alliance of BJP, AINRC and AIADMK is aiming to secure 60% of the votes,” he added.","Amit shah accused congress leader v narayanasamy of turning puducherry into an “atm for the gandhi family” during his tenure as chief minister of the poll-bound union territory.
