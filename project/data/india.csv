Parliamentary panel seeks price cap on cancer drugs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parliamentary-panel-seeks-price-cap-on-cancer-drugs/articleshow/123623411.cms,"NEW DELHI: A parliamentary committee has recommended that the price caps enforced by the govt, for example, the existing 30% trade margin cap on 42 essential anti-cancer drugs - should be extended to cover cancer vaccines, immunotherapy, and oral chemotherapy. It has also suggested that quality of generic drugs available in the market should be monitored citing hesitancy among medical professionals in prescribing them.According to the committee, headed by Narain Dass Gupta, though the govt has taken significant steps in recent years towards strengthening the regulatory framework for governing the pricing of cancer drugs and promoting affordability, a substantial segment of such drugs remains beyond the ambit of current price control mechanisms.""The number of anti-cancer medicines under price control has increased from 40 (in 2011) to 63 (in 2022), still, a significant number of oncology medications are not included under the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013, and thus are not subject to any statutory price ceiling,"" the committee has pointed out and said that this regulatory non-inclusion has led to excessive and often unaffordable pricing.""In view of this, the committee strongly recommends that the govt undertake urgent measures to expand the scope of the DPCO to include the widest possible range of cancer drugs,"" the committee on petitions has recommended.","A parliamentary committee has recommended that the price caps enforced by the govt should be extended to cover cancer vaccines, immunotherapy, and oral chemotherapy.

Sept too likely to be wetter than normal in India: IMD,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sept-too-likely-to-be-wetter-than-normal-in-india-imd/articleshow/123623336.cms,"Heaviest August rain since 1996, says IMD

NEW DELHI: Monthly average rainfall over the country as a whole in Sept is most likely to be 'above normal', at more than 109% of the long-period average, the IMD said on Sunday. It also warned of possible heavy rainfall events during the month in Uttarakhand, north Rajasthan, south Haryana, Delhi and parts of north Chhattisgarh, saying the extreme events may trigger landslides, mudslides, flash floods and urban flooding.Geographically, most parts of the country are likely to receive 'normal' to 'above normal' rainfall in Sept, while some parts of the northeast and east India, many areas of extreme south peninsular India and some parts of northernmost India are likely to receive 'below normal' rainfall, the IMD said.Underlining a trend of increasing rainfall in Sept since the 1980s, IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said it was advisable for the authorities to remain alert and take all precautionary measures to avoid potential risks.He attributed increasing rainfall in the month to shifting of the monsoon withdrawal date from Sept 1 to Sept 17 over the years, saying the interaction of western disturbances with the monsoon system during the transition month leads to higher-than-normal rainfall.The IMD's data for Aug shows that though the average rainfall during the month was merely 5% above the normal, northwest India and the South Peninsula reported 34% and 31% above the normal rainfall, respectively.This led to cloudbursts, landslides and flash floods in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and J&K; the flooding of farms in Punjab that damaged agricultural crops; and many episodes of urban flooding in cities, including in Delhi.IMD's data shows that rainfall over northwest India in Aug was the highest for the month since 1996 and the 13th highest since 1901, whereas it was the third highest for south peninsular India since 2001 and the eighth highest since 1901.Mohapatra said though there was no increasing trend of cloudbursts in the country, the data at least showed an increasing trend of 'mini-cloudbursts' that led to landslides and other disasters, specifically in the hilly region of the country. A cloudburst is a short-lived extreme weather event in which heavy rainfall occurs over very small areas (20-30 sq km) at a very fast rate (100mm per hour). In a mini-cloudburst, rainfall occurs at the rate of 50mm per hour. In India, cloudbursts occur during the monsoon season, normally over orographically dominant regions like the Himalayan region, northeastern states and Western Ghats.Citing the example of heavy rains in Chennai on Saturday, Mohapatra said cloudbursts or mini-cloudbursts are not limited to hilly regions.","Heaviest august rain since 1996, says imd.

Farmer In Village, Sewadar In Delhi: Singh Handled 2 Jobs To Help Family





NEW DELHI: A 35-year-old sewadar was on Friday brutally beaten to death with sticks by a group of men inside the premises of southeast Delhi's Kalkaji Temple following a dispute over the distribution of chunni prasad.Police have arrested five people so far, including the father of one of the men for harbouring him.The victim, Yogendra Singh , hailed from Fattepur in Uttar Pradesh's Hardoi district, where he used to work as a farmer. He visited Delhi every few months, serving at the temple for the past 15 years.Also read: 'They came with iron rods, sticks': How a request to wait for prasad ended in fatal assault at Delhi Kalkaji temple Investigation revealed the group had an argument with temple staff, including Singh, over the same issue just days earlier. On Friday, police received a PCR call around 9.30pm about a quarrel at the temple.To support his family and fund the treatment of his six-year-old differently-abled daughter, Yogendra Singh balanced two jobs, working as a farmer in his native village in Uttar Pradesh's Hardoi district and as a sewadar at Kalkaji Temple in Delhi.Every few months, he would travel to the city to serve at the temple and earn some money before returning home to tend to his wheat and bajra crops.On Saturday morning, Singh's elder brother, Kaushal Singh, stood tearfully outside the AIIMS Trauma Centre, waiting to collect the body. He recalled how Yogendra worked relentlessly and without complaining driven by the single goal of securing a better future for his children. His daughter, who has problems performing basic tasks with her arm and leg, has been undergoing treatment for over a year, costing the family over Rs 1.5 lakh.Yogendra, the youngest of three brothers, last met his wife, mother and two children when he left home two months ago. ""I don't know how to tell his wife that he is no more; she still thinks he is undergoing treatment,"" said Kaushal, who also works as a sewadar. The brothers last met last week. ""I was going to Puri in Odisha for work and he asked me to travel safely and take care of myself. He was such a simple man, who never hurt anyone and only ever cared for others,"" he said.Eyewitnesses to the horrible attack on Yogendra at the temple described the scene as ""complete chaos"", with the attackers using sticks to brutally assault the victim while cursing at him. Brijesh Kumar Singh, 87, said, ""It was around the usual aarti timing and it was raining a little. I remember running away in fear when I saw a large group barge in and beat up a man that I have been seeing around for years.""Speaking to the media, Raju, another sewadar at the temple, said, ""Yogendra was pulled out from the temple dharmshala around 9pm. The mob had iron rods and sticks in their hands and beat him to death."" Another 21-year-old sewadar, who was a close friend of Yogendra for over a decade, was filled with fear and anxiety: ""We get into minor arguments with devotees all the time but such issues can be resolved with conversation.

NEW DELHI: A man killed his wife and mother-in-law with a pair of scissors in northwest Delhi's KN Katju Marg area following a heated argument over a birthday gift for their son.The accused, Yogesh Sehgal, was later arrested in Rohini, where he was detected roaming around with his two sons.On Saturday, around 3.50 pm, police received a PCR call reporting the murder of the caller's mother, Kusum Sinha, 63, and sister, Priya Sehgal, 34, both residents of Rohini.Read also: ‘No gifts from your family’: How a birthday remark sparked Delhi double murder with scissors A police team rushed to the third floor house in Rohini Sector 17, where they found two female bodies lying in a pool of blood. The crime team and forensic experts were summoned to the scene.According to Sinha's son, Megh Sinha, his mother visited Priya's house on Aug 28 to celebrate the birthday of Priya's son, Chirag. Megh alleged that Yogesh killed his mother and sister and fled with the children. Sehgal was arrested and the cops seized his blood-stained clothes and a pair of scissors, the alleged weapon of offence.The murder is attributed to domestic disputes and frequent quarrels.""A dispute erupted between Priya and her unemployed husband, Yogesh, over gifts exchanged between the two families and Kusum stayed at Priya's residence to help resolve the issue,"" said Rajeev Ranjan, DCP (Rohini).When Megh couldn't reach his mother by phone on Saturday, he visited Priya's house and found the flat locked and spied bloodstains near the door. When they broke the lock, they discovered the bodies of Kusum and Priya inside.Megh told the media that when the house was in complete disarray, with belongings scattered all over. When he lifted his mother, he noticed deep injuries on her throat and abdomen, with blood flowing from the wounds. "" I called the police control room. I came to know that Yogesh had gone to the police station and accused Priya and his mother-in-law of beating him,"" Megh claimed.The accused was caught in Rohini with his two children. During interrogation, he revealed that the family was celebrating their youngest son's 15th birthday. He told the cops that his wife made an uncharitable comment about his family not bringing gifts, which triggered his anger. Around 11.30pm, he allegedly stabbed Priya in the neck with a pair of scissors and then attacked his mother-in-law.After committing the crime, Yogesh attempted to clean up the blood. He then locked the door and waited for his sons to return from school. When they arrived, he informed them about the murder and said he would take them somewhere before the police caught up with him. However, he was apprehended before he could execute his plan. According to the investigators, the couple's frequent arguments, coupled with the comment about gifts, seemed to have triggered the violence.","A man killed his wife and mother-in-law with a pair of scissors in northwest delhi.

"More flash floods, landslides? IMD warns India set for wetter September; what's causing record rainfall",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/more-flash-floods-landslides-imd-warns-india-set-for-wetter-september-whats-causing-record-rainfall/articleshow/123615589.cms,"Gadget tips for monsoon: What to do and what to avoid this rainy season

NEW DELHI: India is likely to get more than normal rainfall in September, adding to a monsoon season already marked by extreme weather and heavy damage from rains.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Sunday said that rainfall in September is expected to be more than 109% of the long-period average of 167.9 mm. The forecast indicates that most parts of the country will receive normal to above-normal rainfall, although the northeast, east, several areas in the extreme south peninsula and pockets of northwest India could record below-normal rain.IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra cautioned that intense rainfall could lead to fresh disruptions. He said Uttarakhand may face landslides and flash floods, while south Haryana, Delhi and north Rajasthan could also see major impacts.""Many rivers originate in Uttarakhand. So, heavy rainfall means many rivers will be flooded and it will impact cities and towns downstream. So, we should keep this in mind,"" he said.He further warned that heavy showers are also likely in the upper catchment areas of the Mahanadi River in Chhattisgarh.Mohapatra noted that September rainfall has shown a slight rising trend since 1980, except for lean years such as 1986, 1991, 2001, 2004, 2010, 2015 and 2019.Alongside the rain forecast, the IMD said September temperatures will vary across regions. Maximum temperatures are expected to stay normal to below normal in many parts of west-central, northwest and south India, while they could be above normal in east-central, east, northeast India, parts of northwest India and the western coast.Between June 1 and August 31, India received 743.1 mm of rainfall, around 6% higher than the long-period average of 700.7 mm. June saw 180 mm of rain, nearly 9% above normal, followed by July with 294.1 mm, 5% above average. August recorded 268.1 mm, about 5.2% above normal.Northwest India had an unusually wet August, with 265 mm of rainfall, the highest for the month since 2001 and the 13th highest since 1901. Cumulatively, the region logged 614.2 mm of rain from June to August, 27% higher than the normal 484.9 mm.South Peninsular India also saw heavy rainfall in August, receiving 250.6 mm, 31% above normal, making it the third highest August total since 2001 and the eighth highest since 1901. Overall, the region registered 607.7 mm between June and August, a surplus of 9.3%.The unusually heavy rains have fuelled extreme weather events across several states. Punjab saw its worst floods in decades, with overflowing rivers and breached canals inundating vast stretches of farmland and displacing lakhs of people. In Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir, cloudbursts and flash floods triggered landslides and caused extensive loss of life and property.The IMD said the surplus rainfall was the result of active monsoon conditions, boosted by frequent western disturbances. Mohapatra explained that disturbances between July 28 and August 14 brought heavy to very heavy rainfall to the western Himalayas and nearby plains, including a flash flood and landslide in Uttarkashi on August 5 and riverine floods in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.He added that a rapid revival of the monsoon after August 14, sustained by four low-pressure systems over 15 days, prolonged active rainfall across large areas.According to Mohapatra, northwest India and adjoining Himalayan states faced ""extremely and exceptionally heavy rainfall events"" between August 21 and 27. He said this included very heavy rain over east Rajasthan from August 22 to 24, over Punjab and Haryana between August 23 and 26, and severe flooding and landslides in Jammu and Kashmir from August 23 to 27.Other intense spells were recorded in Konkan and the ghats of Madhya Maharashtra on August 20, east Rajasthan on August 23, Jammu on August 27 and Telangana on August 28.Mohapatra said these events were driven by ""the slow movement of two successive very active western disturbances, interaction with remnants of monsoonal low-pressure systems, strong southerly winds with moisture incursion from the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea and formation of two low-pressure systems over north Bay of Bengal and their movement across central India"".",India is likely to get more than normal rainfall in september.

NEW DELHI: Punjab is battling one of the worst flood disasters in decades, with chief minister Bhagwant Mann urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to release Rs 60,000 crore of the state’s funds which, he said, were “stuck” with the Centre.In a letter sent on Sunday, Mann said that about 1,000 villages and lakhs of people have been hit by the devastation caused by the swollen Sutlej, Beas and Ravi rivers, along with seasonal rivulets fed by heavy rain in Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.“Heavy monsoon rains, coupled with the release of waters from dams, have caused extensive flooding in seven districts, namely Gurdaspur, Kapurthala, Amritsar, Pathankot, Ferozepur, Fazilka and Hoshiarpur,” wrote Mann.He further added, ""With the situation still evolving, there is a grave concern that conditions may further deteriorate in the coming days.""The CM said that around three lakh acres of farmland, largely paddy fields, remain submerged, with crops destroyed just weeks before harvest. “In addition, there has been a widespread loss of livestock, which is severely impacting rural households whose livelihoods are heavily dependent on dairy and animal husbandry,” he wrote.As floodwaters continue to disrupt life across the state, the Punjab government has extended the closure of all schools until 3 September.“In accordance with the directives of chief minister of Punjab, Bhagwant Singh Mann, keeping in view the flood situation in Punjab, holidays have been declared in all government/aided/recognised and private schools in the state until September 3, 2025,” state education minister Harjot Singh Bains announced. He added, “Parents and students are requested to prioritise safety and comply with the instructions issued by the administration. ”The schools had previously been shut from August 27 to August 30.Mann claimed that Rs 60,000 crore of Punjab’s funds are pending with the Centre. Breaking down the figure, he said the state suffered a permanent revenue loss of Rs 49,727 crore due to the implementation of GST and transition from the VAT regime, for which “no compensation has been provided by the government of India”.He also pointed out that cuts in the rural development fund (RDF) and mandi development fund (MDF) had cost the state over Rs 8,000 crore, while the scrapping of Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) projects worth Rs 828 crore “can adversely impact the state’s rural connectivity in the long run”.“Punjab is facing a tough time due to the worst flood conditions. You are requested to release all funds of Punjab stuck with the Government of India, which is to the tune of Rs 60,000 crore,” he urged.The CM also asked the Centre to revise norms under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), calling them “totally unrealistic”. At present, compensation norms fix input subsidy for crop loss above 33% at Rs 17,000 per hectare, equivalent to Rs 6,800 per acre. He said that paying such a petty amount would be a cruel joke with the farmers, further noting that the state government had been topping it up to Rs 15,000 per acre by contributing an extra Rs 8,200.“Since the crops were almost at the harvesting stage, I feel that at least Rs 50,000 per acre should be paid to the farmers. So I request you to revise the norms of compensation of SDRF. Needless to say the state government shall continue to contribute 25 per cent as per the scheme of SDRF,” Mann said.The flood-hit districts include Gurdaspur, Pathankot, Fazilka, Kapurthala, Tarn Taran, Ferozepur, Hoshiarpur and Amritsar, with relief efforts continuing as water levels remain high.","Punjab is battling one of the worst flood disasters in decades.

Tribals to be kept out of UCC ambit: Rijiju,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tribals-to-be-kept-out-of-ucc-ambit-rijiju/articleshow/123621976.cms,"NEW DELHI: Union minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday said tribals in the northeast and other parts of the country will be kept out of the ambit of the proposed Uniform Civil Code (UCC), so that they can ""freely"" live their lives as per their social systems.Speaking at the inauguration of Bhagwan Birsa Munda Bhavan - a tribal research and training centre built by RSS-affiliate Akhil Bharatiya Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram -- in Delhi, Rijiju said: ""Some people create a bizarre atmosphere on social media these days and build a narrative against the Centre. Being a Union minister, I want to share the stand of our govt. Our govt and party (BJP) think about (bringing) a Uniform Civil Code in the country as per the Constitution. When criminal law is equal for all, why should civil law also not be (equal for everyone)?""He added that while some states have already started work on UCC, tribals will remain outside its scope. ""We have clearly said that tribals will be exempted from it. Let Adivasis be given the freedom to live in their own way. This (UCC) will not be implemented in Schedule 6, Schedule 5, the northeast and other tribal areas in the country,"" Rijiju said. The issue of a UCC is being examined by the Law Commission. Uttarakhand has already brought it into force. At the event, Rijiju joined Union urban development and energy minister Manohar Lal Khattar and RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale in unveiling a statue of tribal freedom fighter Birsa Munda.Hosabale underlined the importance of tribal culture in shaping India's national identity. He said tribals should not be seen as relics of the past but as a ""living culture"" that enriches the country. ""India's national identity cannot be imagined without the tribal heritage. Development in tribal areas should empower them, not displace them. Tribals must be partners in growth, not bystanders,"" he said, praising the Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram for its decades-long work to protect tribal identity and traditions.Rijiju also reflected on the role of cultural organisations. ""Except for the Sangh family and a few other organisations, no organisation has genuinely tried to connect tribals in this country. It is said that the tribals should come into the mainstream. I don't understand what the mainstream is because Sanatan includes diverse cultures and is united with them all,"" he said.The organisers of the event said the new centre would serve as a hub for research, youth leadership training, and awareness programmes aimed at preserving tribal traditions, coinciding with the 150th birth anniversary of Birsa Munda.",Union minority affairs minister kiren rijiju says tribals will be kept out of the ambit of the proposed uniform civil code.

This is a property of the state government, right?

Do you want commission?

Social media reacts



A video from the Jharkhand high court surfaced online showing a judge sternly reprimanding an IAS officer during a hearing. In the clip, which is now going viral on social media, the judge can be seen calling out the officer over alleged discrepancies and irregularities.The IAS officer’s name and posting remain unverified, but the judge is heard warning that an FIR will be filed to initiate an investigation.The incident reportedly took place when the judge was hearing a case related to land acquisition and compensation, but the IAS officer had objected to the compensation being offered to the petitioner.“Who are you to object? Ye state ka property hai na? () the judge can be heard saying in the video.""If the state has recognised any person as a ryot, who are you to say that person is not a ryot. You are an alien to the dispute,"" the judge further added.The judge also accused the officer of taking commissions while questioning his authority to object, saying he was preventing rightful awards from being given.“Commission chahiye aapko? () You want commission in each and every case? Under what authority you have objected? The award has been prepared.You are depriving the person of getting the award” the judge said.“You have to take contempt or I will lodge an FIR against you” he said.“Don’t raise a dispute if you are an outsider. In a property dispute, will you come in like a monkey to claim a share?” the judge can be heard saying.The video has drawn appreciation from the public for how the judge handled the situation.“Wow!! Simply awesome. So satisfying to watch this episode. The bureaucrat thought he was above law for a moment. Hats off to you, the judiciary, and judge,” a user commented.“If all Judges take the right approach and ask all IAS officers, EC, and ED to apply law as per the Constitution, 50 percent cases will go away from court,” commented another.“Judicial accountability in action! The judge's sharp questioning demonstrates that courts are taking corruption seriously.

Supreme Court Allows Stray Dogs Back On Streets, But Bans Feeding Them In Public Spaces

Poll Should there be stricter laws regarding the treatment and management of stray dogs? Yes, absolutely. No, current laws are sufficient.

NEW DELHI: Justice Vikram Nath, who headed the Supreme Court bench that recently overturned an earlier ruling on stray dogs in Delhi-NCR, made a humorous remark about the unexpected fame the case brought him.""So long I have been known in the legal fraternity for the little work I do, but I am thankful to the stray dogs for making me known to the entire civil society, not only in this country but world over,"" he said on Saturday at an event in Thiruvananthapuram, as reported by LiveLaw.Justice Nath, who is set to become the Chief Justice of India (CJI) in February 2027, also expressed ""gratitude"" to current CJI BR Gavai for assigning the case to him.“And I am thankful to my CJI for allotting me that matter. I felt very elated… well, people outside India also know me. So I am thankful to them for giving me this recognition,” he quipped. “And I have also been receiving messages saying that apart from dog lovers, dogs are also giving me blessings and good wishes. In addition to human blessings and good wishes, I have their good wishes also.”On August 22, the bench led by Justice Nath stayed the August 11 ruling by a smaller two-judge bench, which had directed that stray dogs picked up from Delhi-NCR must not be released from shelters.The earlier ruling had sparked widespread protests by animal welfare activists and dog lovers.Modifying the order, the three-judge bench ruled that the dogs should be returned to the same location from where they were picked up — but only after being vaccinated and sterilised, aligning the directive with the existing animal welfare guidelines.The CJI shifted the case to Justice Nath's bench after it was brought to his (Gavai's) notice that the August 11 order was in conflict with earlier coordinate bench orders on the same matter.","Justice vikram nath headed the supreme court bench that overturned an earlier ruling on stray dogs in delhi-ncr.

NEW DELHI: Dirty toilets. Delays in baggage retrieval. Long queues at check-in, security and immigration. Airports may soon pay for these lapses with reduced user development fees under a proposal from Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA).The regulator has issued a consultation paper to create uniform performance standards for all major airports - those handling more than 35 lakh passengers annually - and link compliance to tariff structures. Rewards will be offered for exceeding standards, penalties imposed for failing them. Third-party audits will verify compliance.Airport services are characterised by natural monopoly or limited competition, wherein users have limited options on service providers. In such an environment, the role of the regulator extends beyond tariff determination to ensuring that services are delivered efficiently, transparently, and to a standard that meets both operational and user expectations,"" the paper states.The proposed standards cover maximum wait times at every touchpoint - terminal entry, check-in, security, immigration and baggage retrieval. Cleanliness, availability of basic facilities, and use of tech such as Digi Yatra and immigration e-gates will also be assessed.""These standards are instrumental in safeguarding passenger interests, enhancing accountability, and promoting continuous improvement across airport operations,"" Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) said.The authority plans to categorise airports handling over 60 lakh passengers separately, citing differences in infrastructure and operational complexity.While airlines, CISF, Bureau of Immigration and ground-handling agencies handle specific functions, airport operators must ensure adequate counters and infrastructure, an industry insider said.""The aviation ecosystem is inter-linked. Ensuring checked-in baggage is on conveyor belt within allowed time is the airline's responsibility. A ground handling agency does this job for the airline and the agency has an agreement with the airport operator. Check-in is airline's responsibility, security check is CISF's... everything is connected,"" the insider said.A stakeholders' meeting is slated for next week. Comments on the proposal are open until Sept 24.","Proposed standards cover maximum wait times at every touchpoint.

2L file objections seeking their names struck off Bihar poll rolls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2l-file-objections-seeking-their-names-struck-off-bihar-poll-rolls/articleshow/123622158.cms,"NEW DELHI: The over 2-lakh objections seeking the exclusion of 'ineligible' electors from Bihar's draft electoral roll, received till 3 pm Sunday, are essentially on behalf of those who had filled and submitted their enumeration forms as part of 'SIR' while already registered as a voter in a different polling booth, constituency or state, EC sources have said.After EC started serving notices to the likes of Muzaffarpur mayor and her relatives as well as to CPI(ML) Liberation MP Sudama Prasad's wife for maintaining two voter IDs, people who were listed on the draft roll based on enumeration forms signed by them but were simultaneously enrolled at their place of usual residence elsewhere, found it prudent to get their names struck off the roll, a commission official told TOI.Every enumeration form under SIR requires an elector to make a signed declaration that their name is not included in the roll of any other assembly or parliamentary constituency and the elector is aware that a false declaration is punishable under section 31 of Representation of the People Act, 1951, with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year. ""The objections seeking exclusion from Bihar draft roll may have been prompted by fear of penal action under sect 31 for falsely claiming no prior enrolment as an elector,"" said an official.Significantly, the claims received from electors for inclusion in electoral roll number just 33,326, which is barely 16% of the objections seeking exclusion from the roll.Even at the level of political parties, the objections filed by their booth level agents (BLAs) seeking exclusion of ineligible electors (103) are more than four times the claims for 'inclusion' of eligible electors left out from the draft roll.Over 15.3 lakh enrolment applications had been received from newly eligible electors until 3 pm on Aug 31. With a nine-month gap between the last revision and SIR and the usual 2% addition of new voters every year, a figure of 12 lakh new additions on account of citizens attaining 18 years of age is normal. ""The remaining 3.3 lakh additions may be of electors who were never enrolled, despite being of eligible age,"" said an official. Around 3 lakh electors have been served notices over discrepancies in their documents - which put into doubt their eligibility under Article 326 of the Constitution that requires an elector to be at least 18 years of age and a citizen of India.","Over 2-lakh objections seeking the exclusion of 'ineligible' electors from bihar's draft electoral roll, received till 3 pm sunday.
