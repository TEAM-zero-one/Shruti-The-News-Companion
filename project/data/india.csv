"Watch: Vehicles torched, security stepped up as Waqf Act protest turns violent in Bengal's Murshidabad",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/watch-vehicles-torched-security-stepped-up-as-waqf-act-protest-turns-violent-in-bengals-murshidabad/articleshow/120222195.cms,"NEW DELHI: Tension flared up once more in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district on Saturday morning as fresh protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act turned violent in Jangipur, with demonstrators torching multiple vehicles. Visuals from the area showed flames and smoke billowing from burning vehicles as security forces were deployed to restore order.The Bengal Police said the situation in the Suti and Samserganj areas of Jangipur was now “under control”. Security has been heightened, and large contingents of police have been stationed in sensitive pockets of the district.The latest unrest follows violent protests on Tuesday at Umarpur in the same district, where nine people, including four policemen, were injured during clashes. Protesters, who had blocked NH-12 in Jangipur demanding withdrawal of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, pelted stones at the police and set two police vehicles ablaze. “Strict action will be taken against those who resorted to violence. Legal action will be initiated against rumour mongers trying to spread misinformation,” the police had said in a statement.Prohibitory orders remain in force around the Raghunathganj and Suti police station areas, with internet services suspended in Jangipur subdivision to curb the spread of rumours. “The situation is calm, peaceful and under control. There has not been a single untoward incident. Prohibitory orders will remain in place till 6 pm on April 10 (Thursday), and the internet suspension will continue till 6 pm on April 11 (Friday),” said a senior officer.Governor C V Ananda Bose condemned the violence and demanded accountability from the state government. “Attempts to disturb the law and order situation should be put down with an iron hand. The peaceful passage of Ram Navami festivities shows the camaraderie among the people of Bengal and the competence of the administration. Any attempt to frustrate that needs to be curbed,” he said.However, the state government faced criticism from multiple quarters. Mass education minister Siddiqullah Chowdhury said, “Even during the Left rule, police never baton-charged minorities. If someone has resorted to violence, action must be taken. But resorting to lathi charge on a rally is unacceptable.”The BJP accused Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of failing to maintain law and order. “West Bengal, once safeguarded by Syama Prasad Mookerjee, is now bleeding under Mamata Banerjee,” said state BJP chief Sukanta Majumdar, labelling her “India’s most failed CM”.The Waqf (Amendment) Act, which triggered the protests, was passed by the parliament last week.","The bengal police said the situation in the suti and samserganj areas of jangipur was now “under control” security has been heightened, and large contingents of police have been stationed in sensitive pockets of the district.

The National Medical Commission (NMC) has decided that posting postgraduate medical students for medical duties during the Char Dham Yatra will be subsumed under the district residency programme (DRP).DRP is a mandatory three-month rotational posting for all medical residents in district level health facilities so they can understand the problems at the community level. Referring to the posting for the Char Dham Yatra, the NMC said in a circular on Friday that it considers the posting, which will be voluntary in nature, as a potential benefit to postgraduate training.The Char Dham — Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri — are located above 10,000 feet in the Garhwal Himalayas and the yatra begins on April 30. Unlike other places, the NMC circular said, the health needs here will be under different circumstances. “People will be exposed to high altitude-related medical complications. This will provide new opportunities for training of postgraduates. Govt of Uttarakhand has also appealed for healthcare services to be supported by other resources. Several post-graduate doctors are also volunteering to serve,” the NMC said.",The national medical commission (nmc) has decided that posting postgraduate medical students for medical duties during the char dham yatra will be subsumed under the district residency programme.

Kerala HC ordered Friday a CBI investigation against CM Pinarayi Vijayan ’s chief principal secretary K M Abraham for allegedly amassing wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income.Justice K Babu’s order came on a petition by activist Jomon Puthenpurackal, challenging the dismissal of his complaint against Abraham by the inquiry commissioner and special judge of Thiruvananthapuram.The court directed the SP of CBI’s Kochi unit to register an FIR against Abraham and the Vigilance and AntiCorruption Bureau (VACB) to hand over the case files to the central agency.Puthenpurackal’s petition alleged that between 2000 and 2015, Abraham acquired three properties –– an apartment in Mumbai valued at Rs 3 crore, another at Thycaud in Thiruvananthapuram worth Rs 1 crore, and a three-storey shopping complex at Kadappakkada in Kollam, estimated atRs 8 crore.Abraham, who is also CEO of the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board, was previously the state’s chiefsecretary.VACB’s preliminary report said it didn’t find sub stantive evidence to support the allegations. The special court accepted the bureau’s contention and dismissed the complaint against Abraham.HC found “prima facie evidence” suggesting Abraham had acquired assets disproportionate to his known sources of income. It noted that during the preliminary inquiry, the investigation officer deliberately excluded from consideration “a substantial immovable asset” acquired by Abraham by curtailing the check period.Given the fact that Abraham currently holds a cabinet-rank post as chief principal secretary to CM, to whom the directorate of vigilance reports, the court said a VACB investigation would not inspire confidence.To ensure a fair, independent and credible investigation — the court held the pribe must be conducted by CBI.",Kerala hc ordered friday a cbi investigation against cm pinarayi vijayan ’s chief principal secretary k m abraham.

NEW DELHI: The NIA team, led by the agency’s deputy inspector general Jaya Roy who is also the chief investigating officer in the Tahawwur Rana case , aims to extract information about his contacts and activities during his India visits, particularly between Nov 8 and Nov 21, 2008, and is likely to follow through any lead closely with various state Anti-Terrorism Squads (ATS) to take action based on Rana’s testimony.“Rana will remain in NIA custody for 18 days, during which time the agency will question him in detail in order to unravel the complete conspiracy behind the deadly 2008 attacks, in which 166 peo ple were killed and over 238 injured,” said a statement issued by the probe agency soon after the court’s order.Rana’s security during his remand as well as future judicial custody is the biggest challenge for the agency. He has been kept on “suicide watch” which requires him to be under 24/7 human and CCTV surveillance.Only a handful of officers, authorised by NIA chief Sadanand Date, are permitted inside his cell. Date, a Maharashtracadre IPS officer, was posted as additional commissioner of police in Mumbai during the 2008 attack and had received serious injuries fighting the terrorists.Special guards are keeping a watch on Rana on rotation basis and no conversation between them is permissible, a source said. Special precautions will be taken when he is taken to another city amid indications that the agencies don’t rule out attempts to eliminate him to prevent him from“ratting” on his collaborators in the ISI and Lashkar’s sleeper cells within India.NIA and MHA will lead the 26/11 probe, and Mumbai police will assist in the investigation into the role of Rana, Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis said Friday. While Ajmal Kasab was hanged, there was “still a burden on our hearts about those who conspired to attack Mumbai,” he said, adding that the Centre has now succeeded in getting the conspirators to face the Indian justice system.TNN & AGENCIES","Tahawwur rana will remain in nia custody for 18 days, during which time the agency will question him in detail.

"Will trial be over in a year, asked Rana. Lawyers’ reply changed his demeanour",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-trial-be-over-in-a-year-asked-rana-lawyers-reply-changed-his-demeanour/articleshow/120222143.cms,"NEW DELHI: Worry seemed to flit across Tahawwur Rana’s face when he asked his legal counsels on Thursday night whether his trial would be over in a year or so and received “No” as a reply, sources said. They told him that just filing a chargesheet could consume a year, and that the entire trial, even a fast one, could take between five to 10 years.As he got a quick primer on the pace of the Indian legal system, Rana asked if he could plead the “Fifth”, to which his counsels said Indian laws also provide protection from “self-incrimination”, sources said. “Pleading the Fifth”, or invoking the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution, means refusing to answer questions or providing information that could incriminate oneself.Walking slowly in a brown jumpsuit with Crocs as footwear, wearing specta cles and a four-to-six-inch white beard, a fringe of white hair framing a balding scalp, Rana was produced before the special NIA court of special judge Chander Jit Singh in Patiala House Court at around 10.30pm on Thursday amid heavy security. His legal aid counsels (LACs) — advocates Piyush Sachdeva and Lakshya Dheer — were provided to him by Delhi State Legal Services Authority.Looking frail, tired, and jet-lagged, Rana displayed no other signs of anxiety during the court proceedings. However, the effects of age-related ailments were visible on the former Pakistan Army officer accused of a key role in the 26/ 11 Mumbai terror attacks. Rana suffers from various ailments, including abdominal, intestinal, and sinus cysts.According to sources, he came across as a “smart individual” who can strike up “casual conversations”. Rana was offered fruits by NIA personnel while waiting for court proceedings to begin, which he refused, but interacted “comfortably” with agency members. Sources said that Rana is being “taken good care of”. Govt and the agency want to make this case a “model one” so no one is going to take any chances, said sources.Rana’s major concern, apart from his claim that he is innocent and that extradition was not needed as he had already spent over a decade in jail and had been “acquitted” in the matter, was his medical care. On this, NIA assured the special judge that he would be provided all the medical care he needs. The question of “manhandling” also came up in the hearing, which was addressed by the court directing that Rana be medically examined every 48 hours.A US district court trial by jury had acquitted him on June 9, 2011 of conspiracy to provide material support to the Nov 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. The LACs appearing for Rana urged the court to provide him with a “writing instrument” so that he can prepare his defence.The hearing for his re mand was over within 10-15 minutes at around 11pm on Thursday. However, the order was pronounced at around 2am Friday.The prosecution, led by senior advocate Dayan Krishnan and advocate Narender Mann, submitted before the court that Rana is the first accused to be arrested and has links with named terrorists and other accused persons in this case. The counsels appearing for NIA told the court that a detailed investigation is required, Rana has to be confronted with a lot of evidence, and his statements would lead to additional discoveries.The court granted NIA 18 days’ custody of Rana. The agency requested 20 days, expressing concern that Rana might orchestrate terror plots like 26/11 targeting additional Indian cities. The court stipulated several conditions, including permission to consult with his legal representative on alternate days. The court also specified that Rana could only use a soft-tip pen and must conduct meetings with his lawyer under NIA supervision and within hearing range.",Tahawwur rana was produced before the special nia court of special judge chander jit singh in patiala house court at around 10.30pm on thursday amid heavy security.

Delhi weather today: IMD forecast more relief as city cools down after powerful thunderstorm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-weather-today-imd-forecast-more-relief-as-city-cools-down-after-powerful-thunderstorm/articleshow/120222002.cms,"Credit: Rajesh Mehta/TNN

NEW DELHI: IMD expects the relief from heat to continue on Saturday as well, after a powerful thunderstorm with winds touching 84 kmph hit Delhi on Friday evening, disrupting flights, traffic, and power supply while offering a sharp drop in temperature.The storm caused widespread disruption—grounding flights, toppling trees, cutting power lines, and jamming traffic across several parts of the capital. At the airport, 35 incoming flights were diverted and more than 100 others delayed as air traffic control halted operations for nearly 30 minutes.Roads were no better. Uprooted trees choked busy stretches like Mathura Road, Lodhi Road, Janakpuri, Okhla, Najafgarh and Dwarka, with vehicles damaged in some areas, including one incident in Janakpuri where a van was crushed by a fallen tree. NDMC and MCD received numerous complaints about trees being brought down across areas such as Jor Bagh, Hanuman Road, Mohan Singh Place, and Shahdara.Wind speeds varied across the city—touching 84 kmph in southwest Delhi, 74 kmph near IGI Airport, and 70 kmph at Pragati Maidan. Weather stations recorded light showers: 5mm in Narela and 2.5mm in Pitampura.The storm brought down the maximum temperature at Safdarjung from 39.6°C on Thursday to 35.8°C on Friday, while Lodhi Road saw a sharp dip from 31°C to 24°C in just 30 minutes post 6.15pm.According to IMD scientists, the thunderstorm was triggered by a western disturbance that caused dry mid-level winds to collide with moist lower-level winds from the Arabian Sea—a perfect recipe for thunderstorm formation.Power supply was hit in several areas after tree branches damaged power lines. BSES and Tata Power-DDL said their teams were deployed promptly to restore electricity, with some delays in areas like Narela, Bawana, Badli, and Mangolpuri due to safety concerns.In Gurgaon, a gantry on the Dwarka Expressway collapsed during the storm, landing on a moving car. Fortunately, there were no serious injuries or damage. The structure was quickly removed, and traffic has since resumed.","Thunderstorm with winds touching 84 kmph hit delhi on friday evening.

NEW DELHI: Is BJP planning Nitish Kumar 's 'honourable exit' from Bihar politics ? Is BJP looking to reposition him in a different role? As the NDA in Bihar gears up for year end elections speculations are rife that the BJP may stake claim to the top post in the state post elections and find another important role for Nitish Kumar. In such a scenario, Nitish Kumar's son, who has dropped hints for a political debut, may be accommodated at the sate level.It is in this light that senior BJP leader and former Union minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey floated a possible ""plan"" in place for a smooth transition of power.""It is my personal wish that he be made the deputy Prime Minister . If the wish is granted, Bihar will see the second son of its soil, after Babu Jagjivan Ram, rising to the office,"" Choubey, who was also once a minister in Nitish's cabinet, said.""Nitish Kumar's contribution to the NDA is tremendous. He has been strengthening the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi by playing the role of an anchor in the coalition,"" he added.Political analyst Kumar Vijay while speaking to TOI.com said that BJP is likely to remove Nitish from the chief ministerial post in Bihar and relocate him in the central cabinet or any other constitutional post.""Now, BJP wants to dominate the politics of Bihar and become a senior partner in the alliance. It is very likely that BJP will give Nitish Kumar an 'honourable exit' from Bihar by placing him in the central cabinet,"" Vijay said.He further said that the ""BJP would attempt to maintain its alliance with the JD(U) by offering Nitish Kumar's son, Nishant, the position of deputy chief minister.""Ashwini Choubey's proposition was, however, quickly snubbed by the JD(U) which cited Union minister Amit Shah 's earlier remark and reiterated that ""all NDA partners acknowledge the chief minister as the coalition's leader for the upcoming assembly polls"".""We have nothing to do with who says what. Union minister Amit Shah has already announced that the NDA will fight the next assembly polls under the leadership of Nitish,"" JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar told reporters.(People are hopeful of Nitish's rule),"" he added.Earlier in February, Bihar government expanded its cabinet ensuring that the two main NDA partners in the state - the BJP and the JD(U) - have representation in the ministry proportional to their numbers in the assembly. The BJP, which won 74 seats in the 2020 assembly elections now has 21 ministers while JD(U), which won 43 seats, has 13 including the chief minister.In 2020 assembly elections, dynamics between JD(U) and BJP underwent a change after the saffron party, the junior partner in NDA, overtook the JD(U) in the numbers game. BJP then, however, did not stake claim to the chief minister's post and kept its pre-poll promise of forming the NDA government under Nitish Kumar.","Speculations rife that the bjp may stake claim to the top post in the state post elections.

Annamalai's comment on Jayalalithaa and BJP-AIADMK breakup

NEW DELHI: One has a past with AIADMK, and the other made a contentious remark on Jayalalithaa. For Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to take on its biggest critique - Tamil Nadu's ruling government DMK - it needed a working regional alliance with AIADMK. And thus, Nainar Nagendran seems to be a fair choice.BJP on Friday announced its reunion with AIADMK for the upcoming 2026 assembly elections and Union home minister Amit Shah said that the NDA would contest under the leadership of Edappadi Palaniswami. This comes after EPS had declared that the DMK was his party’s ""sole enemy"" and expressed willingness to form alliances with any like-minded parties.The event was followed by Nainar Nagendran, who was formerly with AIADMK, submitting his nomination for Tamil Nadu BJP state president, a post previously held by K Annamalai.Annamalai made it clear that he was not in the race for the party's top post.""The nomination for the post of Tamil Nadu BJP State President has been received only from Mr @NainarBJP. As the Tamil Nadu BJP President, Mr @annamalai_k has made commendable achievements. Whether it is taking the policies of Prime Minister Mr @narendramodi to the people, or taking the party's projects village by village, Mr. Annamalai's contribution is immense. The BJP will utilize Mr Annamalai's organizational skills in the party's national structure,"" Amit Shah informed.Nainar Nagendran is a BJP legislator who represents Tirunelveli constituency in Tamil Nadu. He had already given a hint of the alliance earlier this year when he had said that ""there was no need to intimidate the AIADMK to get the party agree to an alliance with the BJP and a dialogue with EPS was enough for stitching an alliance with the AIADMK.''Annamalai, who was then the BJP president, had distanced himself from the statement and said that Nagendran's remarks were misinterpreted. He had later clarified his stance on the possibility of an alliance saying that he was ready to serve as a ""BJP cadre."" ""I have already said that I am even ready to work as a BJP cadre. I have not entered politics for power. I wanted to work for a better TN,'' he said.He served as a cabinet minister under AIADMK from 2001 to 2006, hence, he is well suited to be a bridge between the newly formed alliance.The freshly formed alliance, which would remain ""permanent and wouldn't change"" as assured by Amit Shah, has had its share of tumultuous past after the saffron party's outgoing chief Annamalai made a remark on late Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa, that did not go down well with AIADMK.""It took time because this alliance is now permanent,"" Shah said on the question of delay in forming an alliance.The BJP and AIADMK were allies in the 2021 state elections, where the BJP secured four seats. However, tensions between the two parties arose after Annamalai made a contentious remark about the late AIADMK leader and former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s conviction in a corruption case.Senior AIADMK leaders had criticized Annamalai for undermining the alliance’s spirit and not acknowledging the AIADMK’s leadership role within the state coalition.Amit Shah, however, this time, categorically said that the BJP wouldn't interfere in the internal matters of AIADMK. ""AIADMK has no conditions and demands... We will have no interference in the internal matters of the AIADMK. This alliance is going to be beneficial to both NDA and AIADMK,"" he said.In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, both parties contested independently with separate alliances, which ultimately weakened their position, as the DMK-led coalition won all the seats in Tamil Nadu.","Bjp on friday announced its reunion with aiadmk for the upcoming 2026 assembly elections.

"La Nina over, India unlikely to see drought or extreme rain",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/la-nina-over-india-unlikely-to-see-drought-or-extreme-rain/articleshow/120221899.cms,"NEW DELHI: La Nina conditions in the Pacific Ocean that generally favour good monsoon rains in India have ended, the US govt agencies declared late Thursday, with the world’s largest ocean likely to stay in ‘neutral’ phase till winter. This could be good news for India’s monsoon, as it reduces the probability of drought or excess rainfall in the season, but it’s also likely to make monsoon forecasts trickier, experts said.Adding to the difficulty of forecasters, conditions in the Indian Ocean too are likely to be ‘neutral’ till at least Aug, as per the latest Australian weather bureau update. Along with the Pacific, surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean play a major role in India’s monsoon, with the ocean’s ‘positive’ phase — when waters in western Indian Ocean are warmer than those in the east — generally boosting rains.For the Pacific, the US’s Climate Prediction Center said in a release that there was more than a 50% chance that neutral conditions will stay till Sept. Its probability of persisting till the year-end was also higher than those of La Nina or El Nino, it said.If this forecast holds true, this would be the first time in 12 years that the monsoon peri od, or the months immediately preceding or following it, won’t have presence of either El Nino or La Nina. These two opposite Pacific Ocean conditions are seen as most important among large scale weather features that determine how much rain India gets during the June-Sept period.“When Pacific Ocean conditions are neutral, all scenarios are open for the Indian monsoon. However, the chances of a drought or a flood year are small. Generally, under neutral Pacific conditions, we don’t expect unwanted monsoon outcomes,” said M Rajee van, veteran meteorologist and former secretary of the Union earth sciences ministry.During neutral conditions in the Pacific, also known as ENSO neutral phase , surface water temperatures in the ocean’s eastern and central equatorial regions are neither abnormally warm (El Nino conditions, which weaken Indian monsoon) nor too cool (La Nina). While this is said to be the ocean’s natural state, neutral years aren’t that common.“Monsoon is more difficult to predict under such conditions. Forecasters have to be more careful and look closely into factors such as the state of the Atlantic Ocean. Internal dynamics can also play a role,” said Rajeevan, who is also IMD’s former monsoon forecaster.As per the first monsoon forecast this year, made by private agency Skymet, total monsoon rainfall in India is likely to be 103% of the long period average, at the higher end of the normal range.","La nina conditions in the pacific ocean that generally favour good monsoon rains in india have ended.
