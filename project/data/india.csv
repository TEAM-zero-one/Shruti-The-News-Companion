Yes, definitely No, current penalties are sufficient

NEW DELHI: Actress Ranya Rao and Tarun Raju on Tuesday were granted default bail by a Bengaluru court in connection with a gold smuggling case , but with strict conditions attached. The bail was granted after the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) failed to file a chargesheet within the legally prescribed period.However, Ranya will remain in custody despite the bail, as she is also facing proceedings under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 (COFEPOSA).COFEPOSA is a stringent preventive detention law aimed at curbing smuggling and safeguarding foreign exchange reserves.It permits authorities to detain individuals without trial for up to one year based solely on suspicion of their involvement in such offences.The bail was granted on the condition of two sureties each and a bond of Rs 2 lakh.The court also barred both from leaving the country and ordered them not to engage in similar offences.The case surfaced on March 3, when Ranya, also known as Harshavardhani Ranya, was arrested at Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru with 14.8 kilograms of gold allegedly smuggled from Dubai.Earlier, on April 26 the Bengaluru hight court had rejected Rao's bail plea.On March 14 and 27, Ranya Rao’s bail pleas were also rejected by the Special Court for Economic Offences and the Sessions Court, respectively. Tarun Raju, a US citizen and a co-accused in the case, was also denied bail on April 7.Ranya’s counsel, meanwhile had accused the DRI of document manipulation and argued the offences are compoundable. Meanwhile, on April 22, the Central Government issued a detention order against Ranya under the COFEPOSA Act.Authorities valued the seized gold at Rs 12.56 crore. Investigations that followed uncovered that Ranya had travelled alone to Dubai 34 times between 2023 and 2025, raising suspicions of her involvement in a larger gold smuggling network.A subsequent raid on her residence led to the seizure of gold jewellery worth Rs 2.06 crore and Rs 2.67 crore in cash. She has been charged under multiple provisions of Sections 135 and 104 of the Customs Act. The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence has also initiated proceedings under Section 108 to probe potential financial violations.","Ranya rao and tarun raju granted default bail by a bengaluru court.

Yes, if they have family in India No, India cannot be a shelter for all

NEW DELHI: Days after rebuffing Rohingya Muslims’ plea against deportation , the Supreme Court on Monday rejected a Sri Lankan national’s plea to settle in India after completing his seven-year imprisonment sentence under UAPA and said the country struggling with 140 crore population cannot be a ‘dharamshala’ (free shelter) for foreign nationals.The Sri Lankan national was arrested in 2015 for his links with Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist organisation decimated by the Sri Lankan Army. A Tamil Nadu trial court had convicted him under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in 2018 and sentenced him to 10 years imprisonment.However, the Madras HC in 2022 had reduced the sentence to seven years and ordered that he must stay in a Tamil refugee camp after completion of prison term and be deported as soon as possible.On Monday his lawyer pleaded that his wife and children have settled in India and that he too wished to settle in India as he has already served seven years in prison. He also said that the Sri Lankan had a right to life and right to move freely.A bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and K Vinod Chandran disagreed and said the Lankan had the right to life but not the right to residence or settle in India. “Is India a dharamshala to host refugees from all over the world? We are struggling with a 140 crore population.India is not a dharamshala to entertain foreign nationals from all over.”When petitioner’s counsel said that his life would be endangered if he is deported to Sri Lanka as he was part of LTTE. The bench suggested that he could move to some other country. “What is your right to settle here,” Justice Datta asked.On May 8, a three-judge bench of Justices Surya Kant, Datta and N Kotiswar Singh had raised similar queries when senior advocates Colin Gonsalves and Prashant Bhushan had pleaded for a stay on deportation of Rohingya Muslims to Myanmar by India. The bench had questioned their right to settle in India. “Right to residence is only for Indian citizens. It is not available to foreigners,” the bench said.",The sri lankan national was arrested in 2015 for his links with liberation tigers of tamil eelam.

NEW DELHI: Anti-corruption bureau on Tuesday arrested senior Jharkhand IAS Vinay Kumar Choubey for his alleged role in the Jharkhand liquor scam after hours of interrogation.This comes after the agency began an enquiry into the allegation of irregularities in excise policy during his tenure as secretary of the excise department.Earlier in September 2024, the agency's economic offence wing had filed an FIR against then excise secretary Choubey alleging to have caused significant financial loss to Jharkhand's exchequer by altering the state's liquor policy.The FIR also names former IAS officer Anil Tuteja, businessman Anwar Dheber, ex-managing director of Chhattisgarh State Marketing Corporation Arunpati Tripathi, IAS officer and former excise commissioner of Chhattisgarh Niranjan Das, and Arvind Singh—all from Chhattisgarh.The FIR claims they formed a syndicate to conspire with Jharkhand officials to amend the state's excise policy, awarding liquor supply tenders to syndicate members and causing financial losses between 2022 and 2023.The FIR alleges the syndicate sold unaccounted domestic liquor with fake holograms and unlawfully provided foreign alcohol to preferred companies, earning illegal commissions worth crores of rupees.The complaint also notes that Choubey and then-Joint Excise Commissioner Singh, with the support of their seniors, manipulated tender norms to favor the syndicate, including a mandatory turnover condition that Jharkhand firms could not meet due to the previous contracting system.As part of their plan, Dhebar and Tripathi met Jharkhand officials in January 2022 to propose replacing the existing contract system with Chhattisgarh's distribution model. This plan, approved during a meeting held in Raipur, was aimed at generating illegal profits from the liquor business.","Vinay kumar choubey arrested for his alleged role in the jharkhand liquor scam.

ANCHI: Jharkhand Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) Tuesday arrested senior IAS officer Vinay Kumar Choubey and joint commissioner of excise department Gajendra Kumar Singh for their involvement in the alleged liquor scam in the state.Choubey, a 1999 batch IAS officer who was secretary to Hemant Soren in his previous term as CM, is at present principal secretary of panchayati raj department. He had served as the state excise department secretary and managing director of the Jharkhand State Beverages Corporation Limited during the Soren govt, which brought in the state's new excise policy.ACB has accused Choubey and Singh of deceiving the Jharkhand govt, leading to a loss of Rs 38 crore to the state exchequer. The officers misused their posts to select placement agencies under the liquor policy without following rules, ACB said.The two officers were questioned for around five hours at the ACB office before their arrest. They were then produced before the special ACB court, which remanded them in judicial custody till June 3. The case against Choubey, Singh and others were lodged under relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act.In Oct 2024, ED had carried out raids on the premises of Choubey and Singh in connection with the liquor scam in Chhattisgarh.Jharkhand BJP president Babulal Marandi said, ""I had written to the chief minister in April 2022 and warned him about the liquor scams taking place in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.

Though there was no official statement by the Indian Railways, the two incidents are being probed, and efforts are on to identify and arrest the culprits. There is no clarity yet on any terror angle to these sabotage bids.""Unknown men had tied wooden blocks to the railway track between Dalelnagar and Umartali stations using earthing wire on Monday evening,"" said GRP SHO, Hardoi, Jaiprakash Singh.Police said the first attempt was made around 5.45pm, when the New Delhi-Dibrugarh Rajdhani Express was heading towards Lucknow. A likely disaster was averted as the loco pilot applied the emergency brake after spotting the obstruction. He removed the wooden logs and informed the railway officials.Another attempt was made soon after, around 6.30pm, to derail the Kathgodam-Lucknow Express on the same route. This time, too, the loco pilot stopped the train in time, and removed the obstruction before proceeding towards Lucknow.After the two incidents, GRP and RPF teams, along with maintenance staff, inspected the track.

New law designed to rob Muslims of religious rights over waqf: Kapil Sibal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-law-designed-to-rob-muslims-of-religious-rights-over-waqf-kapil-sibal/articleshow/121301110.cms,"NEW DELHI: Urging Supreme Court to stay the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025, the Muslim side claimed that the Union govt intended to expropriate waqf properties by de-recognising unregistered properties, including 'waqf by user', and by taking out ancient monuments such as Taj Mahal and Jama Masjid in Sambhal from the ambit of waqf.Leading a battery of senior advocates for the Muslim side, Kapil Sibal told a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice Augustine G Masih that the 2025 law was ""framed and designed for wholesale capture of waqf properties through a legislative fiat, in a process that is non-judicial and purely executive"".When the CJI said courts prima facie presume a law enacted by Parliament to be valid, Sibal said Waqf Amendment Act was discriminatory as it had singled out the Muslim community by mandating that a waqif has to be a practising Muslim for five years to be entitled to donate his properties for waqf. ""Has any other religious denomination been mandated by law to ask the same question to anyone making an endowment for charitable purposes?"" he asked.Sibal said while laws governing waqfs mandated that only Muslims could be members of Central Waqf Council and state Auqaf Boards, the new law allowed govt to nominate persons who could be non-Muslims and even form the majority in the council and boards, thus taking away the right of Muslims to manage their religious bodies.""No religious endowment of Hindus, Sikhs or Christians allows a non-believer in that religious faith to be a member of their endowment administrative body,"" Sibal said, adding that these provisions in Waqf Amendment Act completely violated Muslims' right to religious activities guaranteed under Articles 25 and 26 of Constitution.He said singling out Muslim community was violative of Article 15, which mandates that no citizen is to be discriminated against on the ground of religion. Since the law was ex facie unconstitutional, its operation needed to be stayed till the SC tested its constitutional validity, he added.Sibal said both the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act of 1904 and its updated version of 1958 provided that any govt takeover of an ancient monument, which is a waqf property, for its preservation would not change its character or hamper Islamic religious rituals there. But the present law completely barred ancient monuments from being counted as waqf property, he added.Sibal said if there was a dispute over waqf land, or it was claimed to be govt land, then a govt-appointed officer would decide the dispute and on the basis of his recommendation, the state would carry out necessary corrections in revenue records. ""The govt's own officer deciding disputes over govt land without any prescribed procedure, without any judicial adjudication, is akin to becoming judge in its own cause,"" he said.Sibal and senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan referred to the Ayodhya judgment of 2019 as 'Babri Masjid case' and said in that judgment, the SC had protected the character of ancient monuments as mandated by the Places of Worship Act, 1991. The Waqf Amendment Act could not override the 1991 Act or the SC's five-judge bench judgment, they said.Senior advocate A M Singhvi said the govt's prejudicial argument that there had been a huge increment in waqf properties since the 2013 amendment was fallacious as waqf properties were always there and their registration on the govt portal had increased over the years. Responding to the CJI's remarks on prima facie presumption of constitutionality of the Waqf Amendment Act, Singhvi said the SC had stayed the three farm laws enacted by Parliament in 2019.","Muslim side claims union govt intended to expropriate waqf properties. They say it would de-recognise unregistered properties, including 'waqf by user' sibal said waqf amendment act was discriminatory as it singled out the muslim community.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121301119,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-56688,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
