‘Bihar’s New MY Formula Is Mahila & Youth’: PM Modi Targets RJD-Congress After NDA’s Landslide Win

NEW DELHI: The smooth and peaceful conduct of Bihar polls with the highest turnout ever, particularly after the first special intensive revision (SIR) of its electoral roll in over two decades, is set to boost the confidence of Election Commission as it goes about Phase 2 of SIR across a dozen states and Union territories, including those due for assembly polls next.The overwhelming participation of electors first in SIR and then in Bihar polls is seen as a clear indication that the ‘vote chori’ campaign of the Opposition, led by the Congress and amplified by Rahul Gandhi through his ‘vote adhikar’ yatra in the state, press conferences and even personal attacks against the chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, did not find resonance with the public. The assessment is reinforced by the Congress's modest six-seat tally.Even the Supreme Court had refused to entertain the opposition parties’ and activists’ pleas to stay and quash SIR in Bihar, based on their fear that it would disenfranchise electors from weaker sections and minorities. Of course, the high participation of these very sections in the Bihar poll, has demolished their argument. Prime Minister Narendra Modi , in his victory speech on Friday, said the high voting in Bihar, particularly by the weaker sections, is a big achievement of the EC, as is the elimination of repolls that were synonymous with elections during the ‘jungle raj’ era.He recalled how voting in Naxalism-hit polling stations was earlier wound up at 3 PM over security concerns. This time, he said, electors voted overwhelmingly and fearlessly, erasing old memories of ballot boxes being looted.“I congratulate the EC, poll-related officers, security forces and electors for this,” said Modi. Importantly, he underlined that the electors of Bihar, particularly the youth, had shown that they take SIR with utmost seriousness. “For purity of democracy, every vote matters,” he said while exhorting the party apparatus at the polling station level to contribute 100% to SIR in other places.Speaking to TOI, chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar said: “The zero appeals against the final electoral roll of Bihar, not a single request for repoll from the 2,616 candidates or 12 recognised parties and the highest polling since Bihar’s first election in 1951, show the precision and commitment with which EC and its ground machinery have worked to deliver a free, fair and peaceful election. This, for EC, is the biggest validation”.Kumar was personally targeted in comments by Rahul Gandhi and AI-generated campaigns on Congress’s social media handles, both over SIR and alleged roll irregularities in long-gone elections in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Haryana. Yet, displaying tenacity, EC countered each attack with facts and cited the relevant provisions of law validating its actions and directions. Transparency at each stage of SIR -- enumeration, claims and objections and their disposal -- with daily bulletins and fact-checks ensured a direct line with the electors who willingly participated in SIR and ensured that all deadlines were met.","The smooth and peaceful conduct of bihar polls with the highest turnout ever, particularly after the first special intensive revision (sir) of its electoral roll in over two decades, is set to boost the confidence of election commission.

Bihar election 2025: How BJP's numbers gain cushions it against another Nitish deal with MGB,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-election-2025-how-bjps-numbers-gain-cushions-it-against-another-nitish-deal-with-mgb/articleshow/125340443.cms,"NEW DELHI: NDA's massive win in Bihar has placed BJP in a sweet spot as seat shares of different parties, across the political spectrum, have virtually cushioned it against political exigencies which have bedevilled it in the past.Though BJP and JDU have bonded well since CM Nitish Kumar returned to NDA in Jan 2024 and has vowed to never join hands with RJD again, the decimation of Lalu Prasad's party has ensured any such future prospect is hardly a guarantee for a new govt.RJD's tally of 25, six of Congress and JDU's 85 MLAs together falls short of the majority mark of 122 - a feat that was achievable after the 2020 elections when Nitish decided to dump BJP.A consolidation of the entire Mahagathbandhan with JDU will reach the 120 mark and will require the support of AIMIM's five MLAs to cross the magic number, an uncertain scenario as it includes parties with one or two MLAs and six of Congress, which has a history of legislators breaking ranks in the state.With BJP emerging as the single-largest party for the first time in Bihar after an assembly poll - it had achieved the distinction in the outgoing assembly after bypolls and joining by MLAs of Vikassheel Insaan Party - with 89 seats, the party can hope to spurn any bid to oust him from power, a fate it has suffered twice as Nitish switched between alliances.While the Chirag Paswan-led LJP(RV), which has won 19 seats, has been firmly by BJP's side, two other NDA partners, Jitan Ram Manjhi's HAM and Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Morcham, have increasingly hewed closer to BJP even though both were once in JDU.HAM and RLM have won five and four seats, respectively. BJP with its three other allies outside JDU will have the support 117 MLAs and depend upon support from six more lawmakers to get a majority, if such an eventuality arises.The numbers have also ensured that no non-JDU ally is in a position to push BJP, or is left with much leverage to get its demand met.Paswan in the past has at times flexed muscle in seat-sharing talks or tried to take a line different from BJP on key political issues, a tactic often resented by the BJP brass.Manjhi like Paswan has always been vocal in endorsing PM Narendra Modi but is seen a mercurial ally. Both are also cabinet ministers at the Centre. With Lok Sabha elections due in 2029 and assembly polls over, it is unlikely that any of these allies will venture to disturb the governing coalition.There is a view that BJP may also induct Kushwaha as a minister in the central govt or make his wife, who has won as an MLA, a minister in the state govt to ensure that all its allies are suitable rewarded.BJD had hit a similar enviable zone following the Maharashtra assembly polls where NDA received a sweeping mandate as it has now in Bihar. In the 288-member House, BJP won 132 seats, reducing its dependability on allies significantly. It ensured its decision to replace Sena politician Eknath Shinde with its neta Devendra Fadnavis as CM was executed without any major hiccup.In Bihar, BJP has asserted NDA was fighting the election under Nitish's leadership and that there was no vacancy for the top post, while stopping short of declaring himself as its chief ministerial face. However, his continuation is seen as most likely.","Nda's massive win in bihar has placed bjp in a sweet spot. Seat shares of different parties have virtually cushioned it against political exigencies. No non-jdu ally is in a position to push bjp, or is left with much leverage.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125340483,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-83900,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Leading BJP's celebrations over the party's impressive performance in Bihar, PM Narendra Modi on Friday said the state's people have given a befitting reply to the ""divisive M-Y (Muslim-Yadav)"" with another 'M-Y' (Mahila-Youth), a constructive and positive combine, to thwart the return of ""Jungle-Raj"".""This victory has given a new positive meaning to the 'M-Y', that is 'Mahila and Youth'. Bihar has the highest youth population belonging to all castes and religions. Their wishes, aspirations and dreams have destroyed the communal 'M-Y' formula of 'Jungle Raj',"" Modi said in his address to BJP workers in victory celebrations at the party headquarters here.Waving a ""gamcha"" to greet BJP workers, Modi chanted 'Chhathi Maiya ki Jai' and also used the Bhojpuri lingo 'garda uda diya', meaning the people of Bihar, with this massive victory and their unshakable confidence, have taken the state by storm.Doubling down the attack on Congress, the PM coined a new term, 'MMC' for the opposition party, saying it has become ""Muslim League Maoist Congress"", a remark reflecting concerns within Congress too as Sonia Gandhi, after the 2014 Lok Sabha poll loss, had attributed her party's defeat for being identified as ""pro-Muslim"". ""Today's Congress has become a Muslim League Maoist Congress (MMC), its entire agenda is run only on this,"" Modi said.The PM said Congress is headed for another split as a large section of the party is unhappy with the ""agenda"" of ""Namdaar"" (Rahul Gandhi), and they are set to part ways. He said even Congress's allies are beginning to understand that Congress is drowning everyone in its negative politics. ""That is why, during the Bihar elections, I said that the 'naamdar' of Congress is practising to drown himself and others in the Bihar elections by taking a dip in the pond,"" he said.Modi hailed the leadership of CM Nitish Kumar and the contribution of all NDA leaders, including Chirag Paswan, Jitan Ram Manjhi and Upendra Kushwaha.","'bihar’s new my formula is mahila & youth’: pm modi targets rjd-congress after nda's landslide win.

Bihar election results: Muslim voters look beyond MGB to favour 'their own',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-election-results-muslim-voters-look-beyond-mgb-to-favour-their-own/articleshow/125340294.cms,"‘Bihar’s New MY Formula Is Mahila & Youth’: PM Modi Targets RJD-Congress After NDA’s Landslide Win

NEW DELHI: The five seats won by Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM in Seemanchal region of east Bihar, where Muslim voters have a substantial presence, reflect the community's willingness to diversify its options in areas where it feels secure that experimentation may not benefit BJP.Results show that AIMIM won five of nine constituencies with more than 40% Muslim population, with its Muslim candidates securing decisive victories. They defeated four Muslim candidates fielded either by Mahagathbandhan or JDU, and in one seat, the party defeated a Hindu candidate from BJP. In three of the five victories, AIMIM defeated NDA candidates, including two from JDU. The five seats won by AIMIM are Baisi, Jokihat, Bahadurganj, Kochadhaman and Amour.The party also fielded seven candidates in constituencies where Muslim population ranges between 25% and 40%, but it failed to win any of these seats, which went to NDA. Except for Congress, which won Kishanganj seat, neither RJD nor CPIML-Liberation registered a victory in the belt - marking a shift from the decades-long pattern of Muslims backing an RJD-led alliance. The outcome points to something larger - a desire to look beyond Hindu-led parties and prefer an outfit seen as their ""own,"" even at the risk of aiding BJP and its allies.This pattern first surfaced in the 2020 elections when Muslims in Seemanchal voted for Owaisi despite accusations from RJD and Congress that he was BJP's ""B-team."" AIMIM had then won five seats, though four later defected to RJD. Yet the party's base does not appear eroded. Owaisi has tapped into the community's ""sense of hurt"" over what political scientists term ""invisibilisation,"" pointing out how secular parties seek Muslim votes but hesitate to offer ""fair"" representation. The results indicate that many in the community are listening - something that may, in the future, force secular parties to confront tough choices over greater Muslim representation.","Asaduddin owaisi-led aimim won five seats in seemanchal region of east bihar.

NEW DELHI: In Lakhisarai, BJP’s Vijay Kumar Sinha has secured victory with 1,22,408 votes, defeating INC’s Amaresh Kumar, who finished with 97,468 votes, while Jan Suraaj’s Suraj Kumar trailed behind with 8,722 votes.Lakhisarai Assembly constituency, situated in Lakhisarai district, is among Bihar’s 243 seats and falls under the Munger Lok Sabha constituency. Classified as a General seat, it has long been a battleground between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and rival opposition groups.

Nitish Does It Again: Alliance Back With Landmark 202 Seats

PATNA: National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won a stunning landslide in Bihar, with the governing coalition headed by chief minister Nitish Kumar bagging 202 of 243 assembly seats in a hugely one-sided outcome that underscores the JDU boss's political resilience despite two decades in office, and PM Narendra Modi's sway over voters, while deflating the Grand Alliance's Rahul Gandhi-led campaign against ""vote theft"".The overwhelming victory puts BJP on a firm footing ahead of approaching encounters, especially in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu.The outcome, which surpassed NDA's own expectations, is seen as a pro-incumbency vote conveying gratitude to Nitish Kumar, who put the state back on track after a widely perceived 15 years of anarchy, and marks a ""coming of age"" moment for women voters who turned out in huge numbers to reciprocate Nitish-led NDA govt's measures to empower them using a whole spectrum of means. It also speaks to the success of a strategy to overpower the numerically robust Muslim-Yadav combination with a broader tent covering ""most backward classes"", ""non-Yadav backwards"", extremely backward classes, and significant sections of Dalits.It was the first time that women - including possibly those from the Yadav community - in a supposedly ""socially backward"" state made themselves felt as an independent electoral category.The landslide should potentially put Nitish Kumar on the way to becoming one of India's longest-serving CMs.Bihar voters disregarded concerns about CM Nitish Kumar's health and past political flip-flops to vote overwhelmingly for him. JDU's score of 85, which would have looked improbable after the underwhelming 43 it managed five years ago, was facilitated also by perfect coordination with BJP.BJP, fuelled by Modi's popularity in the state, has for the first time emerged as the single largest party in the state, an achievement that may encourage many in the party to stake claim to the chief ministership. BJP was also the glue for the coalition.Other members of the NDA alliance - Chirag Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party, Union minister Jitanram Manjhi's HAM and Upendra Kushwaha's RLM - contributed to the thumping win with spectacular strike rates.In contrast, the rival RJD-led Mahagathbandhan fared poorly. The Tejashwi-led RJD barely escaped the political ignominy of slumping below its poorest score of 22, which it had crashed to in 2010. Congress, in keeping with what has become a pattern, again fared disastrously, plumbing to an embarrassing single-digit score of 6. CPI-ML's streak of successes since 2020 also came to a halt, with the leftist formation winning 2.Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM has secured 5 seats, but the significance of its success stretches beyond the numbers in that it reflects a yearning among Muslims to diversity options beyond ""secular"" options led by non-Muslims.The coronation of Tejashwi, a CM-in-waiting for five years now, has been further delayed. He now must contend with the risk of BJP making overtures to Yadavs, with RJD having been out of govt for almost 20 years now. Nitish has never dropped his attempt to claim the Muslim vote and may redouble his efforts.In terms of national politics, the Gandhi-led Congress is the bigger loser, with his ""vote theft"" claim not getting any traction with Bihar voters. Congress responded to the shock by sticking to its guns. But it may come under pressure from within to revisit the drawing board.The biggest letdown, however, was Prashant Kishor, whose Jan Suraaj Party drew a blank, proving yet again that a successful career in political consultancy does not automatically translate into one's own political success.","National democratic alliance (nda) won a stunning landslide in bihar. The governing coalition headed by chief minister nitish kumar bagged 202 of 243 assembly seats.

NEW DELHI: Seven people were killed and several others were injured in a powerful accidental explosion at the Nowgam police station on the outskirts of Srinagar According to officials, the blast occurred while a police and forensic team was examining explosive material seized from Faridabad, part of the 2,900 kg chemical cache recovered from an arrested doctor in the case.The explosion caused successive smaller blasts and damaged the police station.The explosion happened late Friday night during sampling of explosives stored at the Nowgam police station, the primary station handling the Faridabad terror module case. The police officials have said whether the blast was pre-planned or accidental will be determined in further investigation.Over two dozen injured, mostly police personnelAt least 27 people — including 24 police personnel and three civilians — were injured, many of whom are undergoing treatment in Srinagar hospitals for burn injuries and blast trauma. Officials said the explosion is linked to the same chain of events that led to the unravelling of a major terror module.The explosive material being examined had been transported from Faridabad, Haryana. It was part of the cache seized during the investigation into the white-collar terror module. The seized explosives, had exposed a “white-collar terror module” linked to Jaish-e-Mohammed and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind operating across Kashmir, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh.Investigators had earlier seized 360 kg of chemicals — ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, sulphur and other materials — from a rented residence linked to arrested doctor Muzammil Ganaie. Approximately 3,000 kilograms of explosives and bomb-making equipment stored by this module was also seized.The midnight blast shattered windows, damaged the station structure and disrupted the quiet of the neighbourhood as ambulances and police vehicles rushed to the site.The terror module came under the police radar when posters threatening security forces appeared on walls in Bunpora, Nowgam, in mid-October. This prompted Srinagar Police to register a case on October 19.Frame-by-frame scrutiny of CCTV footage helped identify three suspects — Arif Nisar Dar alias Sahil, Yasir-ul-Ashraf and Maqsood Ahmad Dar alias Shahid. All three had past stone-pelting cases and were seen pasting the posters.Interrogation of the trio led to the arrest of Maulvi Irfan Ahmad, a former paramedic-turned-Imam from Shopian. According to PTI, he allegedly supplied the posters and radicalised young doctors by leveraging his access to the medical community.The trail then led investigators to Al Falah University in Faridabad, where doctors Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie and Shaheen Sayeed were arrested. The massive explosive haul was seized there.Police believe the core of the module consisted of three doctors: Dr Muzammil Ganaie,Dr Umar Nabi, Dr Muzzaffar Rather. A fourth doctor, Dr Adeel Rather, was arrested separately after an AK-56 rifle was recovered from him. His role is under investigation.The blast comes four days after a deadly car explosion in Delhi, which killed at least 13 people. According to CCTV footage, the car in which the Red Fort explosion occurred was being driven by Umar, a member of this module. According to agency sources, Umar fled as he panicked by the successful crackdown of security forces and his anxiety and desperation likely led to the explosion near Red Fort.(With agency inputs)",Blast occurred inside j&k's nowgam police station on the outskirts of srinagar. Blast occurred while a police and forensic team was examining explosive material seized from faridabad.

NEW DELHI: Nine people were killed and several others sustained injuries after an explosion at the Nowgam police station in the outskirts of Srinagar.According to PTI, the blast took place when the police and forensic team officials were extracting samples from a massive cache of explosives recently seized in connection with the 'white-collar' terror module case.The material had been brought from Faridabad, Haryana, and was part of the 360 kg of explosive chemicals recovered from the rented residence of arrested doctor Muzammil Ganaie, officials said, PTI reported.The bodies have been shifted to the Police Control Room in Srinagar.

Ambulances and police vehicles rushed to the scene, with sirens piercing the air as the injured were taken to nearby hospitals.Small successive explosions after the initial blast briefly delayed rescue operations by the bomb disposal squad. While some of the seized explosives are stored at the police forensic lab, officials said the bulk of the 360 kg cache was being kept at the Nowgam police station, where the primary case linked to the terror module is registered.The terror module was uncovered after threatening posters targeting police and security forces appeared on walls in Bunpora, Nowgam, in mid-October. Srinagar Police registered a case on October 19 and formed a special team to investigate.A detailed CCTV analysis led to the arrest of Arif Nisar Dar alias Sahil, Yasir-ul-Ashraf, and Maqsood Ahmad Dar alias Shahid, all previously booked in stone-pelting cases—who were seen pasting the posters.Their interrogation pointed to Maulvi Irfan Ahmad, a former paramedic-turned-Imam from Shopian, accused of supplying the posters and radicalising the doctors.The probe eventually led police to Al Falah University in Faridabad, where doctors Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie and Shaheen Sayeed were arrested, and where investigators seized the 360 kg of suspected ammonium nitrate, along with 2,900 kg of IED-making material, including chemicals, detonators, wires, and other bomb-making components, were seized.Earlier this week, a powerful blast ripped through a Hyundai i20 near Delhi’s Red Fort, leaving at least 13 dead and several others injured.","At least 24 police personnel and three civilians have been admitted to various hospitals across the city.

NDA's three-fourth majority in the third most populous state, its best performance since 2010, comes as a major endorsement of the 'double-engine plank' of the alliance and has validated the coalition's belief that an opposition campaign centred on targeting PM Narendra Modi carries a stiff cost.The coalition contested the polls as a united family, blurring the 'symbols divide', with smaller allies making significant contributions. Buoyed by the emphatic win despite the Mahagathbandhan's bitter campaign accusing PM Modi of 'vote chori', BJP strategists said the attack backfired - much like the 'chowkidar chor hai' slogan of 2019.A senior party functionary added that the fourth successive win in state elections points to the desire of the electorate to help Modi make up for the surprising sub-par performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. NDA's landslide victory, with BJP's second-best performance and strike rate ever, confirm that the charisma of Modi, the alliance mascot who has completed 11 years in office, remains intact.NDA's previous best tally was 206 of the 243 seats in 2010, with JDU winning 115 and BJ. This time, BJP has emerged as the single largest party. However, party leaders have shown commitment to abide by 'coalition dharma' and reconcile with the continuation of Nitish Kumar as CM - another testament to the fact that stitching alliances is not enough; parties must equally focus on running them smoothly.Unity among allies was so evident that even their poll offices were set up as those of the alliance, not individual parties.Besides, most rallies were held in the name of the alliance, with PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah addressing workers of all parties rather than confining themselves to BJP or its bastions.Although Nitish Kumar had walked away from the alliance in the past, top BJP netas, including PM Modi and Shah, set the narrative for his entire 20 years in office, floating the slogan of 'Mangal Raj' as contrast to Lalu-Rabri's 'Jungle-Raj'. Central and state welfare schemes - particularly those benefitting women - formed the campaign's core, while reminders of the 'dark years' of misgovernance helped consolidate voter sentiment. BJP netas also accepted Nitish as the alliance leader, ignoring apprehensions about the chief minister's health.The PM addressed 13 rallies and held a roadshow in Patna. Throughout the campaign, he conveyed a message of unity to NDA constituents by interacting with them as the campaign kicked off and ironing out differences among them after the announcement of the alliance's candidates.","Nda's three-fourth majority in the third most populous state, its best performance since 2010, comes as a major endorsement of the 'double-engine plank' of the alliance.

This Kishor can’t sing: Bihar tunes out PKNEW DELHI: Prashant Kishor has often been credited for being the scriptwriter of the electoral successes of several political parties and satraps. His most anticipated script has, however, turned out to be a spectacular dud.When he started his public outreach in Bihar with a padyatra from Champaran three years ago, he dominated headlines because of his communication skills that mixed cocky predictions with unconventionally sharp attacks on regional satraps. He promised to deliver the state from the woes of unemployment and unceasing 'palayan' (migration).What added to his appeal was that he had worked with leading politicians, including PM Narendra Modi, and a host of regional heavyweights, such as CMs like Nitish Kumar and Mamata Banerjee, during some of their successful electoral battles. A trailblazer as poll strategist, his successes made waves while failures like the one in UP assembly polls in 2017 did not diminish his image.Unlike most election strategists who prefer the backroom and keep a low profile, he never shied away from offering punditry and denouncing politicians who he believed were not charitable to him, Rahul Gandhi being a famous example after talks of his joining Congress fell through.Some of his predictions, like BJP failing to cross 100 seats in West Bengal in 2021, proved correct and some others missed the mark. But his profile grew, leading to a sense of anticipation before his Jan Suraaj Party's debut in Bihar. His meetings and roadshows drew crowds and his interviews were much sought after.As the dust kicked up by NDA's tsunami settles in Bihar, Kishor and his ambition lie buried. He had claimed that Nitish, whose party he had joined in 2018 with much fanfare before being expelled in 2020 for publicly scorning him for supporting the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, will not be the next CM and his party, JDU, will not win more than 25 seats. As of 10.30pm, JDU had won 85 seats and Nitish is expected to be sworn in again.Kishor's assertion that he will quit politics if this were to happen may come back to haunt him. As a political strategist, he has lost his sheen.However, the annihilation of RJD-led Mahagathbandhan has also opened a narrow path for his unconventional politics that has so far shunned caste calculations and prioritised issues of universal public good like education and employment.","Prashant kishor has often been credited for being the scriptwriter of the electoral successes of several political parties and satraps.

NEW DELHI/PATNA: Before these polls, Chirag Paswan had described himself as ""sabji mein namak"" (salt in vegetables), which is essential to any political broth.Winning 19 of the 29 seats his party contested, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief proved his mettle again in Bihar as his performance propelled NDA past the 200-seat mark. What makes the showing more significant is that LJP (RV) has wrested 17 seats from Mahagathbandhan despite talk of discontent around candidate selection.Chirag's rise in Bihar became evident during seat-sharing talks, when his party got a fair share despite only one of its 143 candidates winning during the 2020 assembly polls. His bargaining power came from the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, when LJP(RV) won all five seats it fought.At a time when the fortunes of other Dalit netas like Mayawati and Jitan Ram Manjhi have been on the decline, the son of former Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan has emer-ged a prominent face. The victory has also virtually put an end to the claim his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras laid to Paswan senior's legacy. Though Paras has been claiming that his Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party is part of NDA, the coalition gave a clear signal when it did not give him a single seat.Before his political plunge, Chirag made his Bollywood debut in 2011 with 'Miley Naa Miley Hum', starring with Kangana Ranaut. In 2014, he convinced his father to ally with BJP. Chirag's political journey began in 2014, when he won Jamui Lok Sabha seat.

Six Ways Nitish Kumar Proved 'Tiger Abhi Zinda Hai' As NDA Registers Big Win in Bihar Assembly Polls

NEW DELHI/PATNA: When Nitish appeared vulnerable, Didis rallied around.That women voters in Bihar are partial to Nitish Kumar-led NDA govt for its pro-women policies since 2005 is well known. What acted as a turbo-boost this time was the cash transfer of Rs 10,000 to over 1.5 crore women in poll season. As if Rakhi after Diwali, the 'das-hazariya' beneficiaries and Jeevika Didis turned out to be the catalyst in NDA's massive win.Women whose lives have changed on the back of govt policies are in substantial numbers - and they cut across caste lines.Some 71.6% women, nearly 9 percentage points more than men (62.8%), turned up to vote this time - up from 59.7% in 2020. It was seen as an endorsement of NDA govt and a 'no' to MGB's return bid. An entire generation of women has benefitted from welfare programmes of the JDU-BJP govt, starting with the free cycle scheme for schoolgoing girls in its first term (2005-10). The sight of smiling girls cycling to school was the defining picture of Nitish's win in 2010, when the RJD-led opposition's decimation was as total as it is now.Even prohibition, with its flaws, draws strong support from women, especially the poor.Journalists travelling through Bihar often came cross the contrasting picture of men trashing the govt for its ""ineffective"" ban on liquor and their wives praising its benefits despite issues with implementation.Then there have been pioneering policies like 35% reservation for women in govt jobs and 50% in local bodies.Jeevika Didis, women members registered with more than 11 lakh self-help groups, also emerged as loyal supporters of Nitish govt.When TOI sought to gauge the mood of Jeevika Didis and other women across the state, a majority of them had expressed support for Nitish and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Also, the relative safety under NDA govt has its share of admirers among women. Hooliganism was part of citizens' everyday experience under RJD govt ftom 1990 and 2005, and kept women in an almost permanent state of apprehension.The Nitish administration earned credit for making Bihar a safer place.Crime does occur, but not many citizens believe that the govt is deliberately soft on criminals - a charge that has stuck with the RJD so strongly that it cannot shake it off despite two decades out of office.Add to these the welfare schemes of Modi govt, especially free ration that ensures women running the kitchen of poor households don't have to worry about their families getting two meals a day. Despite his recent goof-ups in public, Nitish continues to be seen as an avuncular figure who cares for women. And women repay in faith.","Some 71.6% women, nearly 9 percentage points more than men (62.8%), turned up to vote this time. It was seen as an endorsement of nda govt and a 'no' to mgb's return bid.

NEW DELHI: It may be the first time in three decades that RJD doesn't have a single member in Rajya Sabha when the next Bihar assembly elections come around in 2030.The party now has five members in the upper house, but it will gradually lose these seats even if a non-NDA party - like AIMIM with five MLAs in the new Bihar assembly - supports it in Rajya Sabha elections in 2026 and 2028.In 2030, RJD may retain one of its seats if it gets AIMIM support. But it appears a distant possibility as smaller parties invariably go by the politics of the day and their own interests.Out of five RJD members in Rajya Sabha, two - Prem Chand Gupta, the party's leader in the House, and A D Singh - will retire in April 2026. The third one, Faiyaz Ahmad, will retire in July 2028; and the remaining two, Manoj Kumar Jha and Sanjay Yadav, will complete their term in April 2030.In 2026, elections will be held for five vacancies, including two from JDU and another from Rashtriya Lok Morcha (both NDA allies). The strength of the new assembly will help NDA gain all five seats from Bihar next year.Similarly, five members - three from BJP, and one each from JDU and RJD - will retire in 2028.

Mass detentions, coercive interrogations and illegal demolitions will not bring peace; they will drag Kashmir back by decades,"" he warned.PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti said the govt must act strictly against the perpetrators of terror attacks instead of their families.

Flawless seat-sharing formula

Resurrecting 'Jungle Raj' scare

Broadened caste coalition

Massive women voter mobilisation & welfare outreach

Nitish factor & JD(U) resurgence

The National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) seems set to secure a historic win in Bihar with trends showing it is well on its way to secure a whopping 203 seats in the 243-seat assembly, with the BJP posting its best performance since 2010.The 2025 polls unfolded against the backdrop of a meticulously crafted campaign focused on stability, development, and inclusivity, where the NDA's narrative of 'double-engine government' under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar resonated powerfully with the voters.This election saw historic voter participation, with women and young voters emerging as vital pillars of support for the NDA, reflecting a sustained engagement with grassroots welfare schemes and effective mobilisation efforts.At the heart of this electoral juggernaut was not just robust governance but also impeccable political engineering — from flawless seat sharing among alliance partners to resurrecting deep-rooted fears about past lawlessness encapsulated in the widely known 'Jungle Raj' scare. The alliance's success was further amplified by broadening caste coalitions beyond traditional alignments, disrupting longstanding vote banks, and capitalising on the enduring Nitish Kumar factor, which brought JD(U) back to a dominant position within the coalition.The NDA's decisive victory in Bihar in 2025 was strongly supported by a meticulously crafted seat-sharing formula, finalised well before the polls.The alliance comprised BJP, JD(U), LJP (Ram Vilas), HAM(S) and RLM.The BJP and JD(U) evenly contested 101 seats each, a historic power parity indicating maturity within the NDA.Smaller allies like the LJP (Ram Vilas) contested 29 seats, while HAM(S) settled for six seats despite initial demands for 15.This seat sharing was achieved in a ""cordial atmosphere"" with all partners conceding to key demands to avoid intra-alliance friction, a frequent issue in multi-party coalitions.What differentiated the 2025 elections was the emphasis on quality seats rather than sheer numbers, ensuring that each party contested constituencies where they had strong grassroots presence and electoral appeal.This precision in allotment minimised vote-splitting and maximised coalition coherence. Leaders like Jitan Ram Manjhi openly declared unwavering support for PM Modi and the alliance, projecting unity. The arrangement allowed the NDA to mobilise resources and campaign effectively across the caste and regional spectrum.This flawless seat-sharing was a critical structural factor, removing the pitfalls of previous elections where seat disputes diluted NDA's strength. In a hyper-competitive environment like Bihar, the seat sharing formula was a linchpin in translating vote shares into seat tallies, ensuring the NDA's electoral machinery was uninterrupted and optimally functioning to deliver a record majority.Also read: Women, welfare and the ‘phoenix’ CM: How Nitish-led NDA crushed MGB in Bihar elections - 10 key takeaways In its campaign, the BJP-led NDA capitalised heavily on resurrecting the fear of 'Jungle Raj', a term associated with lawlessness during the Lalu-Rabri era (1990-2005).This narrative was revived through incidents like the attack on deputy CM Vijay Kumar Sinha's convoy, which was framed as politically motivated intimidation by ""goons"" aligned with the opposition RJD.This law-and-order scare reminded voters of the chaotic and violent past under RJD's regime, contrasting it with the NDA’s promise of stability and governance.Despite Bihar witnessing its most peaceful elections ever with zero repolls or violent incidents — a dramatic turnaround from previous decades — the Jungle Raj rhetoric struck a chord with many voters wary of instability.The NDA portrayed itself as the only viable safeguard against a return to 'goon raj', appealing to citizens’ desire for security and development.This fear narrative was strategically blended with reminders of the NDA's development agenda, juxtaposing past lawlessness with the promise of infrastructural progress and industrial investment under PM Modi and Nitish Kumar. Consequently, this scare tactic mobilised a wide voter base, particularly those who had lived through or remembered the earlier turbulence, reinforcing voter preference for the NDA coalition.One of the pivotal reasons for the NDA's landslide was its expanded caste coalition that transcended previous rigid caste alignments. Historically, Bihar politics hinged on the Muslim-Yadav (MY) alliance, which benefited the RJD.However, in 2025, a new arithmetic emerged emphasising mahila (women) and EBC (Economically Backward Classes) groups, creating a ‘ME’ factor that substantially boosted NDA’s vote share.NDA consolidated the upper castes through BJP, while Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) secured a strong base among Kurmis and EBCs, which constitute about 36% of Bihar’s population. Additionally, the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Rashtriya Lok Morcha, and Hindustani Awam Morcha augmented the NDA’s Dalit and backward caste appeal, creating a broad and diverse coalition that cut across traditional lines.This strategy diluted the RJD’s reliance on a narrow caste bloc by integrating multiple caste groups and regenerating old alliances with renewed welfare outreach targeting EBCs and Dalits. The coalition’s inclusivity paved the way for securing nearly 49% of the vote against the Mahagathbandhan's 38%.Women played a decisive role in the NDA’s electoral sweep, with historic voter turnout gaps revealing women voted 10-20 percentage points higher than men in many districts such as Supaul, Kishanganj, and Madhubani.The Election Commission’s deployment of over 1.8 lakh Jeevika Didis — women volunteers guiding other women voters regarding booth locations and voting processes — significantly improved electoral participation among women and first-time young voters.NDA’s extensive welfare programs targeting women, including schemes for self-help groups, livelihood support, and social security, energised this vital demographic. The Nitish government's efforts to empower women, coupled with BJP’s national outreach, resonated deeply with female voters who perceived the NDA as a champion of their aspirations and safety.This mobilisation was complemented by adding more than 14 lakh new young voters, many women, expanding NDA’s voter base. The enhanced women voter turnout created a crucial margin that decisively contributed to the NDA’s overwhelming victory.Nitish Kumar’s enduring appeal and the resurgence of JD(U) significantly influenced the NDA’s 2025 triumph.Despite concerns over his age and governance challenges, Nitish remains Bihar’s most trusted political figure, often perceived as synonymous with good governance and development.The slogan ""Bihar Ka Matlab Nitish Kumar"" and ""Tiger abhi zinda hai"" resonated widely, cementing his centrality in voter perception.JD(U)'s comeback was marked by its strategic equal seat-sharing with the BJP, signaling strengthened confidence and relevance in Bihar politics despite BJP’s growing national role within the NDA. Nitish’s governance record on infrastructure and welfare, combined with his image as a stable leader capable of balancing Bihar's complex caste equations, reinforced voter trust.The synergy between Nitish’s JD(U) and BJP under the NDA created a unified front that could appeal to diverse electoral groups, blending Nitish's Kurmi and EBC support with BJP’s upper caste and youth outreach.","The national democratic alliance ( nda ) seems set to secure a historic win in bihar with trends showing it is well on its way to secure 203 seats.

LJP (RV)'s previous performances

Chirag vs Tejashwi in 2030?

NEW DELHI: The two senior Bihar NDA constituents — the BJP and chief minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) — may have swept the assembly elections between themselves. But it was Union minister Chirag Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), which brought in the extra seats and powered the coalition’s march beyond the 200-seat mark.Though the counting of votes is still underway and results are still being declared, the LJP (RV) has won or is leading in 19 constituencies. If it wins all those seats, it would end with a strike rate of 68 per cent and would have a won a whopping 1800 per cent more seats than in 2020.The NDA’s decision to allocate 29 constituencies to the LJP (Ram Vilas) had drawn attention — and some unease — within the alliance. The two smaller partners, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and the Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLP), were each given six seats to contest.The LJP (RV) was allotted the following assembly constituencies: Govindganj, Simri Bakhtiarpur, Darauli, Garkha, Sahebpur Kamal, Bakhri, Parbatta, Nathnagar, Paliganj, Brahmapur, Dehri, Balrampur, Makhdumpur, Obra, Sugauli, Belsand, Marhaura, Sherghati, Bodhgaya, Rajauli, Govindpur, Bochha, Bakhtiarpur, Fatuha, Bahadurganj, Mahua, Chenari, Maner and Kasba.However, the party ultimately contested 28 seats, as the nomination of its Marhaura candidate, Seema Singh, was rejected.The LJP (RV) chose not to field a replacement, and the NDA instead extended support to independent candidate Ankit Kumar.The party was established in 2021 following a power tussle between Chirag Paswan and his uncle, Pashupati Kumar Paras, which resulted in the split of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) into two factions. The faction led by Paswan was named the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) in memory of his late father, Ram Vilas Paswan, who passed away in 2020, while the group headed by Paras came to be known as the Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party.Also read: 'Gamcha' in the air: PM Modi leads celebrations after NDA secures sweeping victory in Bihar elections- Watch Formed in 2000 by Ram Vilas Paswan, the original LJP made a strong debut in the February 2005 Bihar assembly elections, winning 29 seats (178 contested) in a contest that produced a fractured verdict. However, its tally dropped to 10 (202 contested) in the re-election held in October the same year. The party’s strength further declined to three seats in 2010 and just two in 2015. In the 2020 assembly polls, despite being an NDA ally, the LJP contested 134 seats independently, winning only one — but inflicting considerable damage on the Janata Dal (United).The success of the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) has vindicated what was once seen as a risky move, firmly consolidating Chirag Paswan’s standing within the NDA. The outcome is likely to further endear the Hajipur MP to the BJP leadership — particularly Prime Minister Narendra Modi — whom Paswan has described himself as being “Hanuman” to. The young actor-turned-politician’s rising influence could also set the stage for a future political face-off with Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav for Bihar’s chief ministerial post in the 2030 assembly elections.","Chirag paswan’s lok janshakti party (ram vilas) has won or is leading in 19 constituencies.
