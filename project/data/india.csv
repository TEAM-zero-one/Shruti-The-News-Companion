CHANDIGARH: “The very essence of a welfare state is compromised when the instrumentalities of the state become a source of protracted litigation,” Punjab and Haryana HC observed recently, while reprimanding Punjab govt for its apathy in not absorbing a former worker of Anandpur Sahib Hydel Project for over three decades.Justice Harpreet Singh Brar ordered the state govt to pay within three months Rs 5 lakh compensation to the petitioner, nearly 80 now, noting that: “The state shoulders the profound responsibility of fostering justice and equity; it should be a catalyst for the resolution of disputes, not the cause of their proliferation.”Pulling up the state for ignoring binding directions issued in 1989 in an SC judgment in the ‘Mehanga Ram and others versus State of Punjab’ case and reaffirmed through Punjab advocate general’s 1995 undertaking before apex court, HC said forcing similarly situated employees to repeatedly litigate for identical relief was “the very definition of arbitrariness” barred under Constitution. “The principle that the state must act as a ‘model employer’ is not a mere platitude but a constitutional mandate that informs its dealings with its employees,” HC observed.","Punjab and haryana hc reprimanded punjab govt for its apathy in not absorbing a former worker of anandpur sahib hydel project.

NAGPUR: A 35-year-old woman and her 17-year-old son, while trying to fight off an alleged rape bid on the mother, ended up killing a contractor at the construction site where they were working in June. While the mother of four languished in prison, the children’s father, who had supposedly tormented the family for years, allegedly raped the couple’s minor daughters over three months.The horrific abuse came to light in Oct after the couple’s younger son (14) caught the father and sought help from a neighbour, who alerted a group of transgender people living nearby. Members of the transgender community allegedly stormed the accused’s residence, rescued the children, thrashed the father and handed him over to Wathoda Police. Cops arrested the father and booked him under Pocso Act. The survivors — aged between 9 and 12 — were sent to a govt shelter for rehabilitation and counselling.Married off at 14, the woman had fled from Delhi to Nagpur in Dec 2024 with her kids to escape years of domestic violence. Hoping for a fresh start, she and her elder son began working at a construction site in Kuhi area in June, police said.On the eighth day, the labour contractor allegedly dragged the woman to an isolated spot and tried to rape her. As she fought back, her son rushed to her aid. In the scuffle, the contractor was seriously injured and died later.The panic-stricken duo fled the scene but were caught. The woman was sent to Nagpur Central Jail while her son was shifted to an observation home for juvenile offenders.","A 35-year-old woman and her 17- year-old son, while trying to fight off an alleged rape bid on the mother, ended up killing a contractor at the construction site where they were working in june.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday came up with a unique solution to allow an advocate to pay for the maintenance of his son from his first marriage after the man expressed his inability to do so, citing his second marriage and limited income.The apex court directed that the advocate be assigned two or three cases a month by Supreme Court Legal Services Committee, which provides free legal assistance to poor litigants — an assignment that would help him earn an extra Rs 10,000 every month.The Muslim advocate had divorced his first wife with whom he had a son and married another woman with whom he had another child. The first wife moved Supreme Court challenging the mode of execution of triple talaq and claimed maintenance for her child.Appearing for the divorced woman, senior advocate Rizwan Ahmed told a bench led by Chief Justice Surya Kant she was not contesting his second marriage, though annulment of the first marriage was illegal under Sharia. “She is an educated woman. For the past 36 months, he has not paid a penny towards the maintenance of his son,” Ahmed said.When the bench asked the man to pay a monthly maintenance of Rs 10,000 in the interim, the man, through senior advocate M R Shamshad, said he was working as a junior in a lawyer’s chamber and got just Rs 21,000 as monthly remuneration.“He has a wife and a child from the second marriage. Paying Rs 10,000... would ruin his household,” Shamshad said.CJI Kant then asked Shamshad to send the advocate to Supreme Court Legal Services Committee and said he would be assigned two or three cases a month that would earn him Rs 10,000, enabling him to pay maintenance.Ahmed requested SC to consider directing the man to pay a lump-sum amount for the last 36 months. The bench asked the advocate to consider the same and posted the matter for further hearing on Jan 21, when it would also consider petitions by Muslim women challenging the triple talaq custom in Muslim Personal Law and the absence of maintenance provision for women.The women petitioners, many through advocate Ashwini Upadhyay, have challenged Talaq-e-Hasan and all other forms of unilateral and extra-judicial Talaq and sought “framing of guidelines for gender neutral, religion neutral uniform grounds of divorce and uniform procedure of divorce for all citizens”.The SC allowed a plea by advocate Ejaz Maqbool to make Hyderabad-based Sharia Committee for Women a party in the pending petitions. The committee had opposed uniform gender and religion neutral divorce procedure saying it would deprive Muslim women of their right to dissolution of marriage under Muslim Personal Law. It had said every individual shall be held accountable for their actions on the “Day of Judgement” and that concept of divine accountability underscores the balance between rights and responsibilities.","Muslim advocate had divorced his first wife with whom he had a son and married another woman.

Allegation of fraud in entire selection process not sustainable: HC

KOLKATA: Calcutta high court Wednesday decided against scrapping the recruitment of 32,000 teachers for state-run primary schools, setting aside the order of Justice Abhijit Ganguly, who has since become a BJP MP, report Subrata Chattoraj & Poulami Roy.In 2023, Justice Ganguly, while cancelling the appointments based on 2014 Teacher Eligibility Test, said the jobs were “actually sold”. A larger bench had stayed the order.HC said it was setting aside the order because the “conclusion by the investigating authority (CBI) would not reveal that the appointed candidates were involved in any corrupt practices”.The allegation of fraud and corruption pertaining to the entire recruitment process is not sustainable and the appointment of the 32,000 teachers cannot be interfered with,” a bench of Justices Tapabrata Chakraborty and Reetobroto Mitra, hearing an appeal by the state govt against Justice Ganguly’s order, ruled.Cautioning courts against “innovating at pleasure”, the bench said, “There must have been a possibility of systemic malice, assessment of data doesn’t point to the same.”The division bench noted that CBI only found irregularities in the recruitment of 360 candidates. Of them, 264 candidates were given grace marks and identified. Additionally, 96 candidates did not secure qualifying marks but were still appointed.Their services were terminated but they are still teaching following a Supreme Court order.After the verdict, Ganguly said, “They (the HC bench) did what they thought was right. What can I say? Unless I read the judgment and its reasoning, I cannot speak.”CM Mamata Banerjee gave a cautious response. “We respect the judicial process. I’m happy our brothers and sisters have got their jobs back,” she said. Her education minister Bratya Basu showed less restraint. “They (teachers) thought him to be their God, but he turned out to be Satan,” he said.BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari defended Ganguly. “I can’t comment on the judiciary’s order but apparently, there were irregularities in the recruitment process in both TET & SLST. It is also true that thousands of deserving candidates suffered in both cases due to the presence of tainted candidates in the panel. TMC is responsible for pushing them to such a situation.”",Calcutta high court sets aside order of justice abhijit ganguly. Ganguly had cancelled appointments based on 2014 teacher eligibility test.

Sunali

NEW DELHI: More than five months after her deportation to Bangladesh, the Union govt on Wednesday told Supreme Court that it would “purely on humanitarian grounds” bring back Sunali Khatun, who is pregnant, and her eight-year-old son, even as it stuck to its stand that she is an illegal immigrant from Bangladesh.“Law has to bend before humanity,” said a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi as it asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to seek instructions from govt about the return of the other four who were detained in Delhi by police before being deported to Bangladesh in June.On Oct 3, a Bangladeshi court had declared Sunali and her family to be Indian citizens. Mehta said the Union govt had taken a humanitarian view only because of the woman’s advanced pregnancy and that she and her minor son would be brought back to Delhi and adequate healthcare provided to her.Appearing for Sunali’s father Bhodu Sekh, senior advocate Sanjay Hegde told the bench that she would be better off with her father at her native village in Birbhum district of West Bengal.The Mamata Banerjee govt, through senior advocate Kapil Sibal, supported the plea and requested SC to seek a response from the Centre on the return of the other four, including Sunali’s husband Danish.The bench agreed and said Sunali would be better attended to during her pregnancy if she stayed with her father and asked Centre to send her to Bengal after getting her repatriated to India along with her son. It also directed Birbhum medical officer to provide her with pregnancy-related healthcare free of cost.SC also raised an important issue before the Centre: as govt has not proceeded against Bhodu Sekh on the ground that he is a Bangladeshi national, which would lead to an inference that he is an Indian citizen, Sunali’s proving that she is the biological daughter of Bhodu Sekh would automatically lead to her being considered an Indian citizen, along with her son. However, it was quick to clarify that it would be altogether different if she is not biologically related to Bhodu Shekh.The bench said govt can have a summary inquiry about her citizenship while followings principles of natural justice, i.e. giving her an opportunity to present her case and respond to queries of the authorities concerned. Mehta said Sunali and five others were detained by police in Delhi, not in Birbhum, and a preliminary enquiry found they had no documentary proof about Indian citizenship. The bench posted the matter for hearing on Dec 12.","Sunali khatun and son were deported on suspicions of being bangladeshis.

Smriti Mandhana & Palash Muchhal Add Evil Eye Emoji To Bios Amid Cheating Rumours!

NEW DELHI: Indian cricket star Smriti Mandhana and music composer Palash Muchhal continue to dominate headlines, not for their professional achievements but for the emotional rollercoaster surrounding their postponed wedding. The high-profile ceremony, originally scheduled for November 23 in Sangli, was abruptly halted after Smriti’s father, Srinivas Mandhana, suffered a sudden medical emergency and was rushed to hospital. Hours later, Palash too was admitted due to stress-induced health concerns. Both have since recovered, but the families have not announced a new date.On Tuesday, social media went into overdrive after rumours claimed that the couple would now marry on December 7, prompting widespread speculation. However, Smriti’s brother Shravan Mandhana has now firmly shut down the reports.Speaking to Hindustan Times, Shravan addressed the swirling chatter head-on. “I have no idea about these rumours. As of now, it (the wedding) is still postponed,” he said, dismissing the December 7 claims and making it clear that no fresh date has been finalised.The rumour mill intensified after fans noticed that Smriti had deleted all wedding-related posts from her Instagram account following the postponement — though casual photos with Palash remain.With no official communication from either family, the speculative frenzy only grew.Meanwhile, Palash’s mother Amita Muchhal had earlier shared that both families are still recovering from the emotional shock of the disrupted ceremony. She revealed that Palash had dreamt of bringing his bride home and that she had even planned a special welcome. Despite the heartbreak, she expressed optimism: “Everything will be fine, shaadi bohot jaldi hogi.”The situation has also drawn heartfelt support from the cricketing community. Veteran actor Suniel Shetty lauded Jemimah Rodrigues for withdrawing from the WBBL to stand by Smriti, calling it “the purest form of friendship.”","Smriti mandhana and palash muchhal's wedding was postponed on november 23.

""Derogatory"" BJP Hits Out at Revanth Reddy Over Remarks On Hindu Deities

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Rajkumar Chahar on Wednesday said that the city's iconic Taj Mahal had become a ""curse"". The BJP MP told parliament that development in Agra was slowing due to strict regulations under the Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) and NGT norms.Speaking in the Lok Sabha during the winter session, he said the Taj Mahal is a global landmark but tight regulations in the area around the monument have become a “curse” for the city. According to him, these rules make it hard for industries to grow and for new jobs to come up.“The beauty of the Taj Mahal has become a curse for the people of Agra. To protect its beauty, rules under the Taj Trapezium Zone, TTZ, and the NGT do not allow industries to be set up in Agra, and because of this, the youth of Agra are left unemployed,” he said.Chahar pointed out Agra’s strong connectivity through major expressways and said the city has the potential to expand if given the right support. He pushed for an IT hub in Agra, saying the city needs development that protects the Taj’s beauty while creating work opportunities for people.Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) is a defined area around the Taj Mahal to protect the monument from pollution.

"Karnataka CM tussle: Two breakfasts later, Sidda–DKS standoff persists — why it’s a Catch-22 situation for Congress high command",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-cm-tussle-two-breakfasts-later-siddadks-standoff-persists-why-its-a-catch-22-situation-for-congress-high-command/articleshow/125746309.cms,"'We Are United...Will Go To Delhi If High Command Calls': Siddaramaiah, Shivakumar After Meeting

Sidda vs DKS: A long rivalry

Kurubas and Vokkaligas are considered rival castes in the state. While Siddaramaiah hails from the Kuruba caste, DKS is from the Vokkaliga community.

Siddaramaiah is quintessentially a politician and is not known for his business ventures. Meanwhile, DKS is one of the richest politicians and has many big business interests.

Shivakumar is known for having friends across different parties in Karnataka. However, Siddaramaiah has soured relationships with BJP and JDS.

Fine-tuned caste arithmetic

Future of Congress

Status quo, Siddaramaiah stays full-term

Mid-term power rotation naming Shivakumar the chief minister

Hybrid compromise — phased transition, date announced publicly

Dark horse

Kharge factor

NEW DELHI: A lot can happen over a cup of coffee. But even after two breakfasts between Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar , the question over the chief ministerial post in Karnataka still remains unanswered.As the Congress government reached the halfway mark in the state, reports quoting Congress sources suggested that MLAs and MLCs from Shivakumar’s faction had camped in Delhi to push the party high command to make him the next chief minister.Now, both Siddaramaiah and DKS are looking towards the party high command in Delhi for answers.However, the cleanup task for the party high command is not going to be easy, as this is beyond personalities. The Karnataka tussle contains loyalty, fine-tuned caste arithmetic and the future of Congress in the state.Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar together scripted the victory for Congress in the assembly elections in 2023. While Siddaramaiah's AHINDA (Minorities, backward classes and Dalits) countered Bharatiya Janata Party's Lingayat-Brahmin voter base, Shivakumar was credited for managing the organisational machinery in the party.However, even during the run-up to the elections, the rift between both the leaders was clearly visible. During the campaign, Sidda and DKS were rarely seen together sharing a stage. It was only at the eleventh hour that Karnataka party president Shivakumar met Siddaramaiah to put up a united front and bring supporters of both the leaders together.Despite being the pillars of the party in the state, the leaders are polar opposites.After Congress won in Karnataka, the high command was in a fix over the CM face. After days of deliberation, the party went ahead with Siddaramaiah's name given his seniority and popularity. However, an agreement was reportedly reached that DK Shivakumar would take over the reins in the second half of the government.Recently, DKS confirmed the ""secret deal"" after he claimed that there had indeed been “a confidential understanding on leadership transition among five-six leaders” soon after Congress won a landslide in the 2023 elections.“This is confidential. I don’t want to speak publicly on this,” he added.Now after the two and a half years are completed, several seers from the Vokkaliga community are supporting Shivakumar's claim to the chief ministership, emphasising that the community had not held the post since the early 2000s.This has created additional pressure on the party as Vokkaligas have around 13–14 percent share in Karnataka's population, making it the second-most dominant landowning caste after Lingayats.Meanwhile, Siddaramaiah, 79 years old, is the tallest Kuruba leader Karnataka has seen. The Kurubas, a significant OBC community forming around 6–7% of the population, have historically lacked an undisputed mass leader until Siddaramaiah built his political philosophy around them.Additionally, Sidda has also built a support base among the AHINDA community, countering the dominance of Lingayats and Vokkaligas.This has added to the dilemma of the high command as picking Sidda would mean sidelining Vokkaligas and going with DKS would mean looking over the AHINDA and Kurubas.Amid the ongoing tussle over the chief ministerial post, the danger of losing majority in the Vidhan Soudha is looming over Congress government's head.There are 23 Vokkaliga MLAs in the grand old party who are supporting DKS. In a scenario where the Congress high command decides to continue with Siddaramaiah as the chief minister, these MLAs who are openly backing DKS can pull out support from the government.Meanwhile, 9 Kuruba MLAs and 34 Lingayat MLAs are supporting Siddaramaiah, making the CM tussle a Catch-22 situation for the high command.With the decision window narrowing, Congress leadership now has three realistic options:This route maintains continuity, protects AHINDA influence, and sends a signal of stability. A cabinet reshuffle may be sanctioned later as compensation to placate those backing Shivakumar.Backers of DKS see this as honouring commitment and preventing factional drift. But replacing a sitting CM at the midpoint could cause internal rupture if not managed delicately.A future-dated swap could satisfy both camps temporarily, provided the timeline is seen as credible and binding. It is the most politically pragmatic formula but only works if both factions stand down simultaneously.Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party floated another theory that Congress may ignore both Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar and choose a “dark horse” for the chief ministerial post in the state.Talking to reporters, former Karnataka CM and BJP MP Basavaraj Bommai said that chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DKS are “being inflexible due to their ego,” leading the high command to consider alternative options.“CM and Deputy CM both have a very egoistic attitude. They are not ready to budge an inch. Therefore, the high command is compelled to think of the other alternative. So in this context, a dark horse might emerge in the state,” Bommai said.Amid the ongoing developments in the state, all eyes are now on Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge who may be the only one with a solution for this deadlock.Kharge, who also hails from Karnataka, is one of the most seasoned functionaries in the state. First elected to the state assembly in 1972, Kharge won nine consecutive elections until 2008, earning the nickname ‘Solillada Sardara’ (the undefeated chieftain).Acknowledging the power tussle between the CM and his deputy, Kharge played down the “internal conflict” within the party and said that the “high command” will sit together and deliberate on the issue.“Only the people there can say what the government is doing. But I would like to say that we will resolve such issues,” Kharge said.“People in high command — Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and I — will sit together and deliberate on this… We will give the medicine when required,” he added.","'we are united...will go to delhi if high command calls': siddaramaiah, shivakumar after meeting.

Bangladesh Seeks Hasina’s Extradition After Death Verdict As India Weighs Options | Watch

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday permitted the entry of a pregnant woman and her eight-year-old child into India on “humanitarian grounds,” months after the pair had been pushed into Bangladesh.The top court was hearing the Centre’s challenge to the Calcutta High Court’s September 26 order, which struck down the government’s move to deport Sunali Khatun, Sweety Bibi and their families to Bangladesh after labelling them “illegal immigrants.”A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi directed the West Bengal government to look after the minor and instructed the Birbhum district chief medical officer to ensure full medical support for Khatun, including a free delivery.The bench noted solicitor general Tushar Mehta’s statement that the competent authority had agreed to allow the woman and her child into India purely on humanitarian grounds, without affecting any rights or claims, and that they would be kept under “surveillance.”This followed the Supreme Court’s December 1 direction asking the Centre to consider permitting their entry, also on the condition that they remain under “surveillance.”The Supreme Court had earlier asked Mehta to seek instructions on permitting Khatun, who is in an advanced stage of pregnancy, to enter India through the India–Bangladesh border at Malda in West Bengal.The woman’s father said the family had lived as daily-wage workers in Delhi’s Rohini Sector 26 for more than two decades when police detained them on June 18 on suspicion of being Bangladeshi nationals.Sunali, her husband, Danish Sekh and their son were later taken into custody and, on June 27, were deported to Bangladesh.Also read: ‘Night at thana’: Was very scared, couldn’t sleep one bit, says Sunali During the hearing, the bench noted that the woman and her eight-year-old child, allowed to re-enter India, would ultimately be brought back to Delhi, from where they were picked up and pushed across the border in June, as cited by PTI.However, senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Sanjay Hegde, appearing for Khatun’s father, urged the court to direct that she be taken instead to her home district of Birbhum in West Bengal, where her family resides. They also informed the bench that others, including Khatun’s husband, remained in Bangladesh and sought directions for their return as well, subject to instructions from the Centre.Mehta maintained that he would challenge their claim of Indian citizenship, insisting the family were Bangladeshi nationals and that the government’s decision to admit the woman and her child was purely on humanitarian grounds.Justice Joymalya Bagchi observed that if Khatun could establish that she is the daughter of Bhodu Sheikh, it would be sufficient to prove her Indian citizenship.The court has listed the matter for further hearing on December 10.As per a May 2, 2025, memo issued by the union home ministry, Bangladesh and Myanmar nationals found residing illegally in any state or Union territory will first be subject to an inquiry by the respective state or UT government, after which the deportation process will be initiated.","The supreme court on wednesday permitted the entry of a pregnant woman and her eight-year-old child into india on ""humanitarian grounds"" the top court was hearing the centre's challenge to the calcutta high court's september 26 order, which struck down the government's move to deport sunali khatun, sweety bibi and their families.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125738725,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1379982,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

‘Is There Any Law?’ Renuka Chaudhary Sparks Row After Bringing Stray Dog to Parliament

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday weighed in on the controversy over colleague Renuka Chowdhury bringing a stray dog to Parliament House, saying pets are not allowed outside the complex but “inside”.“Dog is the main topic of today, I believe. What has the poor dog done. The dog had come here. Why is it not allowed?” Gandhi told reporters, as quoted by PTI.Pointing towards the Parliament House building, he said, “Pets are not allowed here but they are allowed inside.”“I guess these are the things that India is discussing these days,” he added.Gandhi’s comments drew criticism from BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari, who said on X, “Rahul Gandhi is comparing his own Congressmen, and Opposition leaders to Dog! This is how Parivarvadi treat temple of democracy.”Congress MP Renuka Chowdhury on Monday brought a stray dog onto the Parliament grounds on the first day of the Winter Session, despite objections from fellow MPs. Defending her action, she reportedly said that the ""real dogs are sitting in Parliament"" who regularly bite people.Chowdhury later explained that she had found the puppy on her way to Parliament. She said she stopped after witnessing a collision between a scooter and a car, and noticed the puppy by the roadside before deciding to take it with her.","Leader of opposition in lok sabha rahul gandhi says pets are not allowed outside the complex but ""inside"" gandhi's comments drew criticism from bjp spokesperson pradeep bhandari.

BJP bags 83% of Rs 915cr routed via Tata Group-controlled trust,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-bags-83-of-rs-915cr-routed-via-tata-group-controlled-trust/articleshow/125728589.cms,"NEW DELHI: Almost 83% of the total Rs 915 crore political donations routed through the Tata group-controlled Progressive Electoral Trust (PET) in 2024-25 went to BJP, while Congress’ share was a mere 8.4%.A perusal of the contribution reports of various electoral trusts (ET) for 2024-25, now available on the Election Commission website, indicates that the scrapping of electoral bonds by the Supreme Court in Feb 2024 may not have totally dried up the coffers of BJP. The party in office received Rs 757.6 crore from PET, Rs 150 crore from New Democratic ET, over Rs 30.1 crore from Harmony ET, Rs 21 crore from Triumph ET, Rs 9.5 lakh from Jan Kalyan ET and Rs 7.75 lakh from Einzigartig ET. This adds up to nearly Rs 959 crore.PET, which receives political donations from various Tata group companies and disburses them in Lok Sabha election year, had passed on a total Rs 454 crore to three parties in 2018-19, of which 75% or Rs 356 crore went to BJP, Rs 55.6 crore to the Congress and Rs 43 crore to Trinamool Congress.Since the 2024-25 contribution report of Prudent Electoral Trust, through which the lion’s share of political donations is routed with BJP being the biggest beneficiary, is not uploaded on EC website, its disbursals to the governing party cannot be assessed.BJP received Rs 856.4 crore via trusts, of which Rs 724 crore came from Prudent, and Rs 1,685 cr from bonds in 23-24.Congress received Rs 77.3 crore from PET in 2024-25, Rs 5 crore from New Democratic ET and Rs 9.5 lakh from Jan Kalyan ET. Prudent contributed Rs 216.33 crore to Congress and A B General ET, Rs 15 crore, as per contribution report filed by Congress for 2024-25. Thus, the grand old party received over Rs 313 crore of its total 517 crore contributions in 2024-25 through the trust route.PET also disbursed donations worth Rs 10 crore each to Trinamool, YSR Congress Party, Shiv Sena, Biju Janata Dal, Bharat Rashtra Samithi, JDU, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and LJP-Ram Vilas.Interestingly, Congress contributions in 2024-25 fall way short of the Rs 828 crore it had received via bonds in 2023-24, but are higher than its Rs 171-crore bond income in 2022-23, a non-general election year. Similarly, TMC’s Rs 184.5 crore receipts in 2024-25, of which Rs 153.5 crore were through trusts, are no match for its Rs 612 crore receipts via bonds in 2023-24. BJD, which received Rs 245.5 crore in bonds in 2023-24, received Rs 60 crore in donations, including Rs 35 crore via trusts, in 2024-25. BRS not only saw its Rs 495 crore contributions in bonds (2023-24) eroded, but its receipts from trusts also dipped to Rs 15 crore from Rs 85 crore in 2023-24.The Tata Group companies that donated to PET include Tata Sons Pvt Ltd (Rs 308 crore); TCS (Rs 217.6 crore); Tata Steel (Rs 173 crore); Tata Motors (Rs 49.4 crore); Tata Power (Rs 39.5 crore); Tata Communications (Rs 14.8 crore); and Tata Consumer Products, Tata Elxsi Ltd and Tata Autocomp Systems (Rs 19.7 crore each).Among other trusts, the Mahindra Group-backed New Democratic ET gave Rs 150 crore of its total Rs 160 crore kitty to the BJP, with Congress and Shiv Sena-UBT receiving Rs 5 crore each.Triumph, to which CG Power contributed Rs 20 crore, disbursed Rs 21 crore to BJP and Rs 4 crore to Telugu Desam Party. Harmony ET contributed Rs 30.1 crore to BJP, Rs 3 crore to Shiv Sena-UBT and Rs 2 crore to NCP-Sharad Pawar. Jan Pragati ET disbursed Rs 1 crore to Shiv Sena.","Almost 83% of the total rs 915 crore political donations routed through the tata group-controlled progressive electoral trust (pet) in 2024-25 went to bjp, while congress’ share was a mere 8.4%.

A rally held in Bhopal on Wednesday to mark 41 years of the Bhopal gas tragedy turned tense after BJP supporters alleged that protesters were preparing to burn an “RSS effigy” along with one representing Dow Chemical, the current owner of Union Carbide.The rally was organised by four survivor groups and began at Bharat Talkies, but it was stopped midway following the dispute. The march was meant to pass the city bus stand and end at the gas memorial near the closed Union Carbide factory in JP Nagar, where protesters planned to burn the effigies.Assistant police commissioner Rakesh Singh Baghel told PTI that a complaint was received during the rally about an effigy that looked like it depicted workers of a particular organisation. After verifying the complaint, police removed the effigy, saying some people found it offensive. Baghel warned that any attempt to target an organisation or ideology would lead to action.""If any attempt was made to create a controversy at the rally, strict action will be taken,"" the police officer maintained.RSS worker and BJP mandal president Ashish Singh Thakur claimed the effigy showed an RSS “sevak” and accused protesters of planning to burn it. He called it “anti-national” work and demanded a case against those involved. Survivor groups rejected the charge and said their effigies represented people responsible for the 1984 disaster, not any group.The gas leak on the night of December 2–3, 1984, killed at least 5,479 people and left thousands injured. As every year, an interfaith prayer was held on Wednesday at Barkatullah Bhawan.",The rally was organised by four survivor groups and began at bharat talkies.
