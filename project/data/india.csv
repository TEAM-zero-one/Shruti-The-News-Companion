SC takes exception to seeking info on suspension through RTI applications

New Delhi: In a surprise public acknowledgement of corruption in judiciary, a Supreme Court bench led by CJI Surya Kant on Wednesday said there is a growing trend of judges passing a series of orders for extraneous considerations on the eve of their retirements.While hearing a petition filed by a Madhya Pradesh principal district judge challenging his suspension 10 days prior to retirement, allegedly because of two judicial orders passed by him, the bench of CJI Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said, ""Petitioner just before retirement started hitting sixes. It is an unfortunate trend. I do not want to elaborate on it.""Senior advocate Vipin Sanghi, appearing for the judicial officer, said he had an impressive career with very good rating in annual confidential reports. He was to superannuate on Nov 30 but was suspended on Nov 19, ostensibly because of two judicial orders. ""How can an officer be suspended for judicial orders which can be appealed against and rectified by higher judiciary?"" asked Sanghi.The bench said, ""Disciplinary proceedings cannot be initiated against a judicial officer for passing orders which are erroneous. He cannot be suspended for this. But if the orders are palpably dishonest?""The judicial officer was to retire on Nov 30. SC on Nov 20 directed the MP govt to postpone the retirement by one year as it had increased the retirement age of state employees to 62 years.The judicial officer would now retire on Nov 30, 2026. ""The judicial officer did not know, when he passed those two orders, that his retirement age had been increased by one year. There is a growing trend of judges passing so many orders just before retirement,"" the CJI said.The bench asked Sanghi as to why the judicial officer did not approach HC to challenge the suspension. Sanghi said that since it was a full court decision, the judicial officer thought it would be better to move SC for a fair hearing.The bench said, ""There are so many instances when full court decisions have been set aside by HCs on the judicial side."" The bench also took exception to the judicial officer seeking grounds for his suspension through RTI applications. ""He could have submitted a representation in this regard. It is not expected of a senior judicial officer to resort to the RTI route to get information. We see no ground to entertain the petition. The petitioner can make a representation to the HC for recall of the suspension order. The HC would decide his representation in four weeks,"" the bench said.","'what if orders are palpably dishonest?' Sc takes exception to seeking info on suspension through rti applications.

"7 years on, OBC list still to get Parliament's stamp",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/7-years-on-obc-list-still-to-get-parliaments-stamp/articleshow/126047962.cms,".

New Delhi: The Centre has not notified the central list of OBCs for the last seven years since it granted constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes, which mandated that the list of backwards will in the future be approved by Parliament as against the present practice of publishing it through an executive order.The indecision on the crucial list, well-placed govt sources said, is a result of the govt's apparent reluctance to touch the Rohini commission report on sub-categorisation of backward classes - halting the transition to the new path laid down by the 102nd constitutional amendment of 2018. As a consequence, the central list of OBCs has remained frozen since 2018, without any fresh inclusion or exclusion of communities.Sources said the central list has to be notified by Parliament in view of the 102nd constitutional amendment which put NCBC at par with the national commissions for SCs and STs, while laying down that the OBC list too would follow the notification process of parliamentary approval like the lists of SCs and STs. ""...A process that was initiated in 2019 was put in deep freeze,"" a source said.The seeming hurdle created by the Rohini commission is puzzling.Sources said the govt cannot simply replicate the existing OBC list through Parliament because it was found to have many discrepancies, like spellings, and had asked the Rohini panel to compile corrections. But the panel's main mandate was sub-division of the central list of OBCs, which emerged as the key political agenda of BJP a few years ago. But since then, the governing party gave up its push to divide the backward list because of apparently altered political sensitivity, and has kept the report confidential since July 31, 2023, when the commission finally submitted its report after 14 extensions over six years.""Moving to correct the OBC list would require opening the Rohini report,"" an official said. Amid the limbo, the list has remained frozen for seven years as the old system of inclusion/exclusion, NCBC Act of 1993, was repealed along with the promulgation of the 102nd constitutional amendment. The 1993 Act had the exclusive mandate of inclusion/exclusion. Sources said there are around 450 proposals for inclusion/exclusion at different stages of processing with the social justice ministry.",The centre has not notified the central list of obcs for the last seven years. The indecision on the crucial list is a result of the govt's apparent reluctance to touch the rohini commission report on sub-categorisation of backward classes.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126047971,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-null,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

New Delhi: Announcing that protests against the move to end MGNREGA will start this week, civil society groups said Modi govt cannot use mere parliamentary majority to end a rural livelihood programme that resulted from extensive consultations across the board and forging of a national consensus that included BJP.Founding members of MGNREGA, intellectuals and advocacy groups associated with the scheme came together to slam the “VB-G RAM G” bill, arguing that provisions in the proposed legislation will mark the end of job guarantee and hurt the socially vulnerable groups that depend on it for sustenance.NREGA Sangharsh Morcha, comprising economists Jean Dreze, who was part of the Sonia Gandhi-headed NAC that played a key role in drafting the job scheme, Prabhat Patnaik and Jayati Ghosh, Annie Raja, Yogendra Yadav, B Venkat of All India Agricultural Workers Union, Mukesh Nirvasit, several NGOs and activists, addressed a press conference to express their concerns, while warning they will this week start nationwide protests against the abolition of MGNREGA. They said the shifting of financial burden to states has made the new programme uncertain as the states are cash-strapped.Patnaik said mere parliamentary majority cannot undo the national consensus that resulted in the enactment of MGNREGA, and the Modi govt needs to bring an “alternative consensus” to repeal MGNREGA. The new Bill takes away the “right-based approach” and makes the scheme a “gift” from the govt, Ghosh said.“We have seen the pattern ...Right to food is a right, but now we have ration bags coming with the PM's photo on it,” she said.Venkat said govt is trying to create a conflict between farmers and agricultural workers. “This provision to pause the scheme during peak agricultural seasons has been brought in just to please those who control the land.”Dreze said, “The Union govt would now have full power to decide when and where to implement the scheme, while the obligation is on the states. It is like saying I give a work guarantee, but don’t guarantee that the guarantee will be in place.”","Civil society groups said modi govt cannot use mere parliamentary majority to end a rural livelihood programme.

It will hold another meeting and is expected to call these stakeholders again. The DGCA-ordered committee was constituted on Dec 5 and was asked to submit its report in 15 days.Captain Sam Thomas, president of Bengaluru-based Airline Pilots Association of India, created flutter at the meeting by alleging corruption in DGCA and was asked by members to refrain from making sweeping allegations without producing evidence. He alleged that one can commit any wrong, but stay safe if he touched right feet.A committee member said IndiGo, which has offered apology for the ordeal, was far from apologetic in its response before the panel.It told the panel that several factors combined to derail its operation, including a glitch in system, which needed rebooting, and adverse weather that had their pilots stuck in different zones.IndiGo was represented by its COO Isidre Porqueras, while officials of Air India, Akasa Air, Spice Jet and Air India Express appeared before the panel as well. Civil aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha and top functionaries of other stakeholders were part of the deliberations.Replying to a query, IndiGo said all luggage, except 52 which remained unclaimed, have already been delivered.The panel's meeting came against the backdrop of the suspicion, subject of investigation, that IndiGo remained resistant to the implementation of guidelines (Flight Duty Time Limitation) that allowed more rest for pilots in line with global norms aimed at ensuring flyers' safety.It has been accused of engineering the disruption, leveraging its market dominance, to force the ministry to roll back the regulation as implementing it would have required the airline to hire more pilots.

Mumbai: Supreme Court this week stayed a Bombay high court order that enhanced a Mumbai family court's monthly interim maintenance to a wife by seven times. HC had raised the amount from Rs 50,000 to Rs 3.5 lakh for a woman in Pune and observed the estranged husband approached court with ""unclean hands and lack of credibility"" in a matrimonial dispute, reports Swati Deshpande.A bench of Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah and Justice K Vinod Chandran Monday directed the husband to pay, in four weeks, up-to-date arrears as per the family court's interim order dated Feb 24, 2023, in a divorce petition filed in 2015.The husband challenged HC's Nov 10 order before apex court, contending the HC erred in enhancing the maintenance.SC heard senior counsel Madhavi Divan for the husband and Kamini Jaiswal for the wife and posted the matter for Jan 20. It said the wife may file her reply by then, and until the next date, HC's direction to pay the enhanced maintenance shall remain stayed, subject to payment of arrears and continuous payment of the monthly maintenance awarded by the family court.","Bombay high court had enhanced a mumbai family court's monthly interim maintenance to a wife by seven times.

AQI Severe-Plus, Delhi’s Worst In More Than 1 Yr

Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

NEW DELHI: A dense blanket of fog enveloped Delhi-NCR on Monday morning, severely reducing visibility across roads and disrupting normal movement, while the region continued to grapple with toxic air quality in the ‘severe-plus’ category. The deteriorating weather and pollution conditions also impacted air travel, prompting IndiGo Airlines to issue a travel advisory warning passengers of possible delays and urging them to plan their journeys with extra caution.Amid changing weather conditions, IndiGo Airlines on Monday issued a travel advisory for passengers as Delhi witnessed the first signs of winter fog this season, impacting visibility at the airport.In its advisory, the airline said visibility levels around the airport were currently reduced, and as a result, flight operations were being adjusted, with some departures likely to take longer than usual. IndiGo assured passengers that its teams remain available to provide support, acknowledging that travel plans, schedules, and connections are important.The airline also cautioned that road traffic could be slower due to foggy conditions and advised passengers to plan their journeys accordingly and allow additional time to reach the airport.IndiGo said it is closely monitoring the situation and will keep passengers informed, adding that departures will continue as conditions improve, with safety remaining the top priority.Similarly Air India issued a travel advisory for passengers; it said, ""Poor visibility due to dense fog is impacting flight operations in Delhi and parts of Northern India. Please check your flight status at: http://airindia.com/in/en/manage/flight-status.html before heading to the airport.""Earlier on Sunday, Delhiites could literally see poison in the air. A thick layer of toxic smog enveloped the capital, turning the city into a gas chamber with air quality plunging to 'severe-plus' category for the first time this year.The city's 24-hour average air quality index stood at 461, the second-worst recorded in Dec and the worst in nearly 13 months. Since the scale began in April 2015, only once has a higher AQI been recorded in Dec - 469 on Dec 21, 2017. For any month, the last time Delhiites a suffered worst AQI was on Nov 18 last year (494).High moisture, low temperatures and calm winds effectively trapped pollution close to the surface even as a grey smog screened out the sun for most of the day. Winds are predicted to pick up slightly post-noon on Monday, which could disperse some pollutants.On Sunday, atmospheric ‘inversion’ made the situation worse. This occurs when cooler air near the ground gets trapped under warmer air above, stopping pollutants from dispersing. Though meteorological conditions remained unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants, local emissions continued to remain high.“This is a true depiction of Delhi’s local emissions because wind speeds are almost zero, meaning there is hardly any inflow or outflow of air. Vertical ventilation is confined to a column of just 600 metres, which means whatever remains in the box — Delhi — is largely its own emissions. Under these conditions, the contribution of dust is negligible. When dust is released from construction activity, it usually spreads to other areas due to wind, but with winds nearly calm, it cannot pollute places beyond the immediate site of release,” said Gufran Beig, founder of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) and Chair Professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS).Of the total 39 active air quality monitoring stations, 38 saw ‘severe’ AQI while only Shadipur was placed in the ‘very poor’ category at 375. Of these, three stations — Wazirpur, Rohini and Ashok Vihar — maxed out at 500, while several others reported AQI above 490.This is the second spell of severe air days in Delhi this season. The city had recorded three consecutive severe days from Nov 11 to 13. In this winter season, the city has recorded five such days, when AQI surpassed 400.After air quality started rapidly deteriorating on Saturday, the Graded Response Action Plan’s stage III was imposed in the morning. Stage IV was invoked on Saturday evening as AQI showed no sign of improvement. Currently, all stages of GRAP are in force.Delhi’s highest-ever AQI of 497 was recorded on Nov 6, 2016. The second-worst air quality day followed on Nov 18 last year with AQI reaching 494.Experts said since winds are likely to rise only marginally post-noon, no significant respite from toxic air quality is expected on Monday. However, the Centre’s Air Quality Early Warning System (EWS) stated that the AQI may dip to ‘very poor’ on Monday. “Delhi’s air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ category from Dec 15 till 17. The outlook for the subsequent six days from Dec 18 is that AQI is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ category,” said the EWS.The CPCB classifies AQI 050 as 'good', 51-100 as 'satisfactory', 101-200 as 'moderate', 201300 as 'poor', 301-400 as 'very poor', 401-450 as 'severe', and 451 and above as ‘severe plus.’ Meanwhile, the lowest visibility on Sunday morning was recorded at 200 metres at Safdarjung. It was 350 metres at Palam. “Safdarjung reported 300 metres at 5.30am but calm winds further reduced the visibility to 200 metres at 8am,” said a Met official.India Meteorological Department measures fog in terms of visibility. Visibility between 500-1,000 metres is considered ‘shallow’ fog. Fog is 'moderate' when visibility is between 200-500 metres, and ‘dense’ below 200 metres.The maximum temperature was recorded at 24 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. The minimum stood at 8.2 degrees C. IMD has predicted shallow to moderate fog in the early hours of Monday.","A dense blanket of fog enveloped delhi-ncr on monday morning, severely reducing visibility across roads and disrupting normal movement.

Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

NEW DELHI: Advocate Vishnu Joshi, representing a victim’s family in the Goa nightclub fire case, on Wednesday said that one of the Luthra brothers requested a Dunlop mattress during police remand.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before granting custody. Speaking to reporters, he said, “Today, when the Goa Police presented them in court, one accused, during their arguments, claimed he had spinal issues and other health problems. He requested that they be provided with a Dunlop mattress during their police remand. The state strongly opposed this... Their pre-medical examination showed them to be perfectly fit. ”He added that the duo had attempted to evade legal proceedings since fleeing India.“Since these people (Luthra brothers) absconded and fled the country, they have been employing tactics to somehow escape. First, they filed an anticipatory bail application on vague grounds in the Rohini Court, even though that court had no jurisdiction... But that bail application was rejected. Since then, they have been trying wherever they get a chance to obtain some kind of relaxation,” Joshi said.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before ordering custody.“The brothers claimed to be suffering from back pain. The court considered all submissions and directed the police to first conduct a pre-medical examination and re-examination. No medical necessity was found, following which the court, exercising its full authority, granted five days of police remand,” he said.The Luthra brothers, owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, were remanded to five-day police custody by the Mapusa Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) court.They were brought back to Goa from Thailand following their deportation and produced before the court after undergoing multiple medical examinations.After landing at Manohar International Airport, Mopa, under police escort around 10.45 am, the duo was taken to a primary health centre in Siolim and then to the District Hospital in Mapusa. The court directed fresh medical examinations before ordering the five-day custody to allow investigators to question them regarding alleged safety lapses at the club.The blaze broke out on December 6 around 11.45 pm during a crowded event at the nightclub, when electric firecrackers allegedly struck the wooden ceiling. The incident claimed the lives of 25 people, including tourists and staff, while several others were injured.Police said the brothers fled India hours after the incident on December 7, leaving for Thailand while rescue operations were under way. Goa Police launched a nationwide and international manhunt, issued a lookout circular and sought an Interpol Blue Notice.Following their detention by Thai authorities for illegal stay and the suspension of their passports, the brothers were deported to India on emergency travel documents.They landed at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport on Tuesday and were arrested by Goa Police, who obtained a 48-hour transit remand from a Delhi court to facilitate their return to Goa.They have been booked under several provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder and negligence. Investigators have also arrested several others linked to the nightclub’s operations and are probing allegations that the venue was operating with expired licences and without mandatory safety clearances.","Advocate vishnu joshi, representing victim's family, says one of the luthra brothers requested a dunlop mattress during police remand.

Opposition remains unsparing

NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh minister Sanjay Nishad on Wednesday defended his controversial remark on Bihar CM Nitish Kumar pulling down a woman’s hijab, saying his comment was ""misunderstood"" due to translation issues and carried no ill intent, even as opposition parties intensified their demand for an unconditional apology.As outrage mounted across political lines, the Nishad Party chief sought to play down the remark, describing it as a casual, light-hearted comment made in Hindi that lost its meaning when translated.The comment, widely criticised as misogynistic and crude, was made during an interview with a private television channel and later circulated on social media.""My remark was tweaked and twisted, misinterpreted, its spirit lost in cacophony and translation,"" the Uttar Pradesh fisheries minister told news agency PTI, responding to criticism from the Congress, Samajwadi Party (SP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).""If someone has taken offence, I am willing to take back the words from my side,"" he said.Nishad argued that linguistic and cultural differences played a role in the backlash, pointing to his roots in the Bhojpuri-speaking belt of eastern Uttar Pradesh.""I belong to Gorakhpur and the Bhojpuri-speaking belt and expressions and conversational styles differ from region to region,"" he said, adding, ""In Bhojpuri, this is a common way of urging people not to make too much of any issue and to counsel restraint.I chose to use the same style in Hindi and didn't know it will become such an issue.""Drawing comparisons with other regions, he said, ""Just as language and expressions vary in Haryana, Delhi, Maharashtra or Tamil Nadu, dialects in north India and eastern Uttar Pradesh also differ. That does not mean there was any intention to insult.""The controversy stems from a video showing Nitish Kumar pulling down a woman’s veil during a government programme in Patna on Monday. Nishad defended the Bihar chief minister’s action, claiming Kumar had ""merely removed"" the veil to confirm whether the actual beneficiary of a government scheme was present.He further said the lapse lay with officials responsible for organising the event. ""The responsibility lay with officials who should have ensured proper arrangements before the programme,"" he said.Nishad insisted his comments were not directed against any woman, community or religion. ""There was neither malice nor any intention of disrespect,"" he said, while alleging that the issue was being deliberately amplified for political gains.The controversy snowballed after Nishad made the remark during the televised interview: ""(He is also a man; one should not go after someone so much. What happened if the veil was removed? What would have happened if he had touched somewhere else?""Congress’ Uttar Pradesh chief Ajay Rai described Nishad’s statement as ""outrageously anti-women"" and said it reflected the mindset of the BJP and its allies. ""We seek unconditional apology failing which we will seek minister's dismissal,"" Rai told PTI.Samajwadi Party spokesperson Abbas Haider termed the remarks ""condemnable and undignified"", adding, ""I would also like to ask if this is the idea of the BJP led government in UP which the minister has reflected in his statements."" He too demanded ""an immediate and unconditional apology.""The AAP’s Uttar Pradesh unit accused the minister of making ""shameful"" and ""anti-women"" comments, saying the statement exposed a ""crude and misogynistic mindset"".Social media platforms were flooded with posts criticising Nishad for what many described as an unacceptable and sexist viewpoint.The video clip has since been widely shared, further fuelling the political storm around the minister’s comments.","Uttar pradesh minister sanjay nishad defends his controversial remark on bihar cm nitish kumar pulling down a woman’s hijab.

Delhi Pollution: China Shares Playbook On How To Fix Air Quality Amid Politics Over Accountability

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday continued hearing matters related to Delhi’s air pollution crisis, with air quality remaining in the “severe” category in several areas of the national capital region.The court has orally observed that the measures taken by authorities so far have been a “total failure” in effectively curbing the rising levels of air pollution in the Delhi–NCR region. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Surya Kant remarked that any meaningful reduction in pollution would require broader and long-term planning rather than ad-hoc responses.During the hearing, the court said, “Let us think of pragmatic and practical solution of the menace,” stressing the need for workable measures to address the pollution crisis.During the proceedings, the bench was also informed about another issue related to the MCD toll at Gurgaon, which allegedly causes traffic congestion for hours, leading to long queues of vehicles and adding to air pollution. The court directed the DMC to cooperate on the issue and consider suspension of nine toll plazas for a temporary period. It said a decision should be taken within one week and placed on record.CJI Surya Kant remarked, “we do not want income you generate, but you definately generate a lot of litigation from these tolls ...wewant to come out on a concrete plan for absolute no toll plaza till next year 31st January.""The court further asked the Delhi government to verify construction workers rendered idle by pollution curbs and ensure direct transfer of funds to their bank accounts, cautioning that the money should not “disappear, travel to another account”. It also asked the government to consider providing alternative work to affected workers.Responding to the court, the Delhi government said that around 7,000 construction workers have so far been verified out of nearly 2.5 lakh workers affected, and that money would be transferred into their bank accounts.With respect to various petitions highlighting the inadequacy of recent measures aimed at protecting children, such as the Delhi government’s directives to shut schools or allow them to function in a hybrid mode, the Court noted that these were merely temporary policy decisions taken to mitigate health risks.The bench refused to interfere with the Delhi government’s decision regarding school closures or hybrid operations. “The short-term measures are only to provide temporary protection to children and elderly persons. These are purely interim policy decisions. At best, they can be viewed as an extension of vacations, as schools are anyway scheduled to remain closed for 10 to 15 days during the winter,” the Court observed.The observations came as the top court reviewed the continuing impact of air pollution despite repeated directions issued over the years. A bench headed by Chief Justice of India Surya Kant, along with Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi, has been monitoring the situation as air quality continues to pose serious health risks.The bench has also flagged lifestyle choices of the affluent as a major reason behind poor implementation of pollution-control measures. The Chief Justice observed that the well-off continue to use large diesel vehicles, generators and other polluting equipment in violation of restrictions, even as vehicular emissions choke the region. The court noted that it is the poor and working classes who are the most exposed to hazardous air and suffer the worst health consequences.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) told the court last week that the transport sector contributes about 41 per cent of Delhi-NCR’s ambient air pollution load. Dust and construction activities account for 21 per cent, industry 19 per cent, power plants 5 per cent, residential activities 3 per cent and other sources 11 per cent. CAQM said stubble burning is a periodic factor limited to a short window each year, while other sources remain constant.",The court has orally observed that the measures taken by authorities so far have been a “total failure” in effectively curbing the rising levels of air pollution in the delhi–ncr region.

National Herald Case: Court Declines To Act On ED Chargesheet, Congress Claims Truth Has Prevailed

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday issued a statement, a day after the Congress demanded an apology citing a government reply in Parliament that said no papers were “missing” from the Prime Ministers Museum and Library (PMML).In a series of posts on X, the Ministry of Culture rejected the opposition’s claims and defended its stand. On JN papers: Vide letter dated 29.04.2008 Shri M V Rajan, representative of Smt. Sonia Gandhi , requested that Smt. Gandhi wishes to take back all of the private family letters and notes of former PM Jawahar Lal Nehru. Accordingly, 51 cartons of Nehru Papers were sent to Smt. Sonia Gandhi in 2008. PMML has been in continuous correspondence with the office of Smt Sonia Gandhi since then for return of these papers including the letters from PMML to Smt Sonia Gandhi dated 28-01-2025 and 03-07-2025,"" it said asserting that ""Nehru Papers are not “missing” from PMML as their whereabouts are known. ""Further clarifying it added, ""These documents, relating to the first Prime Minister of India, form part of the nation’s documentary heritage and not a private property. Their custody with PMML and access to citizens and scholars for research is vital.""This comes after the Congress sought an apology from the central government and the BJP after the Centre informed Parliament that no papers related to Jawaharlal Nehru were missing from the Prime Ministers Museum and Library (PMML).The government’s reply in the Lok Sabha came against the backdrop of a controversy in which PMML had alleged that the Congress was in possession of certain papers linked to India’s first prime minister. Raising the issue, BJP MP Sambit Patra asked whether the PMML’s 2025 annual audit had found any Nehru-related papers missing. In response, Culture Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said the annual inspection had not found any missing papers relating to Jawaharlal Nehru.","Ministry of culture rejects opposition’s claims and defends its stand.

Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

NEW DELHI: A Goa court on Wednesday sent Saurav Luthra and Gaurav Luthra to 5-day police custody in connection with the devastating fire at an Arpora club venue. The Luthra brothers are the owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, which was engulfed in fire that claimed 25 lives.The brothers were produced before the Mapusa Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) court after being brought back to Goa from Thailand. The court remanded them to police custody to allow investigators to question them about the circumstances leading to the blaze and alleged safety lapses at the club.Before being produced in court, the duo underwent multiple medical examinations. After landing at Manohar International Airport, Mopa, around 10.45 am under police escort, they were first taken to a primary health centre in Siolim and later to the District Hospital in Mapusa for health check-ups.On court directions, they were again sent for a fresh medical examination before being presented before JMFC Puja Sardesai, who ordered five days of police custody.The fire broke out on December 6 around 11.45 pm during a crowded event at the nightclub, when electric firecrackers allegedly struck the wooden ceiling, triggering a massive blaze. 25 people, including tourists and staff, lost their lives, while several others were injured.Advocate Vishnu Joshi, appearing in the Goa nightclub fire case, said the court ordered multiple medical examinations of the Luthra brothers after they complained of back pain before deciding on police custody.“Today, the brothers claimed to be suffering from back pain. The court considered all submissions and directed the police to first conduct a pre-medical examination and re-examination. No medical necessity was found, following which the court, exercising its full authority, granted five days of police remand,” Joshi said.According to the police, the brothers fled India within hours of the incident. They left for Thailand on December 7, even as rescue operations were under way and a criminal case was registered against them at the Anjuna police station.Goa Police subsequently launched a nationwide and international manhunt, issuing a lookout circular and seeking an Interpol Blue Notice.After their passports were suspended by the ministry of external affairs, Thai authorities detained the brothers in Phuket for illegal stay.They were later deported to India on emergency travel documents issued by the Indian embassy. The duo landed at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport on Tuesday, where they were arrested by Goa Police and produced before a Delhi court, which granted a 48-hour transit remand.Police have booked them under various provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder and negligence.Investigators have also arrested several others linked to the nightclub’s operations and are probing allegations that the venue was operating with expired licences and without mandatory safety clearances.","Luthra brothers are the owners of the birch by romeo lane nightclub, which was engulfed in fire that claimed 25 lives.

Pune/Nashik: Conviction over securing a flat under a 10% EWS quota in 1995 by showing lower income has put a question mark over Manikrao Kokate's continuation as an MLA and as a Maharashtra cabinet minister.A Nashik sessions court upheld Tuesday a Feb 20 trial court judgment convicting and sentencing the sports minister and NCP functionary, along with his brother Vijay Kokate, to two years of rigorous imprisonment in the housing quota cheating case. The siblings had secured two flats. The court, however, set aside the trial court's direction to Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority and deputy collector to cancel the allotment of flats to the Kokate brothers and restore possession as earlier.Kokate represents Sinnar in rural Nashik. The ruling triggers the risk of ""immediate disqualification"" under the Representation of the People Act for sentences of two years or more, unless a higher court stays the conviction.Public prosecutor Sudhir Kotwal said the matter must now go to the high court. ""Under the law, Kokate's disqualification is certain unless he gets a suspension of his sentence and a stay on his conviction from the high court.Even with urgent circulation, this may take eight to 10 days. There is no bar on disqualification in the intervening period,"" Kotwal said.Assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar said he had not yet received the order. Supreme Court ruling from 2013 states disqualification is immediate, despite a three-month window to appeal. Relief comes only if conviction itself is stayed.Kokate's lawyer Avinash Bhide disagreed. ""We have a month's time to secure a stay and suspension from the high court. Even after that, the matter goes before the speaker,"" Bhide said.After the trial court ruling, Kokate had secured bail and on March 5, a sessions court stay on conviction and sentence during pendency of appeal. That protection has lapsed. ""Once a sessions court confirms conviction in appeal, it has no power to grant bail. The matter goes to the high court,"" Kotwal said.The prosecution said the brothers applied for flats under the EWS quota, declaring annual income of Rs 25,000 each, below the Rs 30,000 eligibility ceiling. ""Allotment relied on affidavits. When falsity emerged, onus lay on the deponents to prove otherwise,"" Kotwal said. Prosecutors said Kokate failed to disclose improved finances even by 1995, citing documents showing supplies of 70 tonnes, 80 tonnes and 120 tonnes of sugarcane in 1993, 1994 and 1995 to the Kopargaon cooperative sugar mill, yielding substantial earnings. ""This line weighed with the sessions court while affirming conviction and sentence,"" Kotwal said.Opposition parties accused BJP-headed govt of double standards, citing the swift disqualification of Congress MP Rahul Gandhi after his 2023 defamation conviction and contrasting it with the continued tenure of Kokate. ""Govt should immediately dismiss Kokate,"" Maharashtra Congress chief Harshvardhan Sapkal said. NCP state president Sunil Tatkare said the party would decide its next course of action after discussing the ruling with party chief and deputy CM Ajit Pawar.","Kokate represents sinnar in rural nashik.

NEW DELHI: As Delhi-NCR continues to grapple with rising air pollution, the Supreme Court orally observed that the measures implemented by authorities so far have been a “total failure” in effectively curbing the escalating levels of air pollution across Delhi and its neighbouring regions.In a separate development, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) shared a video from inside the Lok Sabha, alleging that Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Kirti Azad was seen vaping in the Lower House during the ongoing parliamentary session.Meanwhile, India summoned Bangladesh High Commissioner Riaz Hamidullah to convey its “strong concerns” over the deteriorating security situation in Bangladesh, including threats directed at the Indian High Commission in Dhaka.The SC criticized authorities for failing to control Delhi–NCR air pollution, calling ad-hoc measures a “total failure.” It urged the government to implement practical solutions, including compensating construction workers rendered idle by pollution curbs and exploring alternative work.The bench also highlighted the contribution of affluent citizens’ lifestyle choices to poor air quality. Temporary school closures were upheld for child safety and the court directed suspension of nine MCD toll plazas to reduce traffic-induced pollution, emphasising the need for long-term, effective pollution control strategies.The BJP shared a video claiming that Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Kirti Azad was seen vaping inside the Lok Sabha during the ongoing Parliament session, triggering political controversy.BJP leaders, including its IT cell chief Amit Malviya, urged West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee to clarify the matter, calling the conduct unacceptable and against parliamentary norms.The issue stems from an earlier complaint by BJP MP Anurag Thakur to the Lok Sabha Speaker about e‑cigarette use in the House.

'Delhi NOT Most Polluted': Doctor's Shocking Reveal On Toxic Monster; And How To Fight Back

NEW DELHI: Delhiites woke up to winter's first dense fog on Monday, with visibility dropping to zero in the city. There was havoc at Delhi airport as departures remained suspended for nearly five hours from 4am to 9am when visibility was below 100m.As many as 228 flights - 131 departures, 97 arrivals - were cancelled, over 800 delayed and five diverted to other airports, officials said. The ripple effect of delays continued long after the fog cleared around noon. At least 100 trains were running late.Safdarjung records zero visibility at 12.30am, things look up after 9amThe civil aviation ministry said dense fog conditions impacted flight operations at several airports in north India.According to India Meteorological Department, visibility began to dip sharply from Sunday night. “It dropped to 150 metres at 11.30pm. By 12.30am Monday, there was zero visibility at Safdarjung, the city’s base station. This continued till 2am and improved marginally to 100m by 2.30am. At Palam, the lowest visibility recorded was 50m at 4am,” an official said.Visibility started improving after 9am, touching 300m at Safdarjung by 9.30am and 700m by 10.30am, with the sun making an appearance.At Palam, visibility improved from 100m at 9am to 300m by 10.30am, and to 500m by noon.Flight operations were severely impacted at IGI Airport from 4am, when visibility dropped to 50m and low-visibility procedures were initiated. According to live flight tracking website Flightradar24, 260 arrivals and 400 departures were delayed till Monday evening. “Some flights arrived late at IGI due to weather conditions at the origin airport. Since they came late, these flights departed late,” said an airport official.Airport officials said pilots who are trained in CAT III procedures can make an aircraft land with a minimum visibility of 50m, while an aircraft can take off at a minimum visibility of 125m. “However, pilots who are not trained in CAT-III procedures wait at the taxiway after all formalities such as boarding are completed and take off when they get clearance as they need visibility of around 500m. This causes major flight delays,” an airport official said earlier.Apart from Delhi, flight operations were hit in many parts of north India. The civil aviation ministry posted on X, “In view of the prevailing situation, certain flights may be delayed, diverted or cancelled. Passengers are advised to stay in touch with their airlines for real-time flight updates, regularly check airport and airline websites/apps, and plan for additional travel time.”IndiGo, in a statement, said low visibility (below minima), due to dense fog, severely impacted operations at Delhi and other airports in northern India, “which is unfortunately beyond our control”. “While operations adjust to the prevailing weather, some flights may experience delays while a few others may be proactively cancelled through the day to prioritise safety and help minimise extended waiting at the airport,” said IndiGo.Air India said poor visibility due to dense fog hit operations of all airlines. “In the interest of safety and to avoid prolonged uncertainty, some flights have been cancelled,” it said on X.The civil aviation ministry said, “The Director General Civil Aviation has reviewed preparedness for fog conditions. Officers should monitor passenger inconvenience and ensure that airlines are facilitating operations and discharging responsibilities as per their respective SOPs and any directions issued.”","As many as 228 flights - 131 departures, 97 arrivals - were cancelled, over 800 delayed and five diverted to other airports.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday asked both the Centre and the Tamil Nadu government “not to make it into a language issue” while hearing the state’s plea challenging a Madras high court order directing it to establish Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) schools.The observation was made by a bench of Justices BV Nagarathna and R Mahadevan after senior counsel P Wilson, appearing for the DMK-led Tamil Nadu government, argued that the Centre should adopt a two-language formula in line with the state’s policy instead of the three-language formula under the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.As the Centre’s counsel began to respond, the bench urged both parties to refrain from turning the matter into a language issue.“Don’t make it into a language issue. We are a federal society. You are part of the Republic. If you come one step forward, they will also come one step forward. We are concerned with rural students getting an education. The directions were passed only in the interest of students who are entitled to be admitted to such schools,” Justice Nagarathna said.She was referring to a direction issued by the Supreme Court earlier during the hearing asking the state to ascertain the extent of land required for establishing JNVs.The bench further suggested that the Tamil Nadu government could place its two-language policy before the Centre, which could then consider it, instead of both sides sparring over the issue.“You can’t have this ‘my state, my state’ approach. This attitude must go. You come one step forward, they will also come one step forward,” the court remarked.The bench also observed that the state government should view the move as an “opportunity rather than an imposition.”“Don’t take it as an imposition; it is an opportunity for your students. You can say this is our language policy, and they cannot discredit your policy,” Justice Nagarathna noted.",The supreme court on monday asked both the centre and the tamil nadu government “not to make it into a language issue’ the bench was hearing the state’s plea challenging a madras high court order directing it to establish jawahar navodaya vidyalaya schools.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125985407,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-279710,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
"After 9-year gap, government launches national mental health survey",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-9-year-gap-government-launches-national-mental-health-survey/articleshow/126045703.cms,"NEW DELHI: After a nine-year gap, the central govt has launched a fresh National Mental Health Survey to assess the scale of mental illness across India, expanding its coverage to all states and UTs for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic.National Mental Health Survey-2 (NMHS-2), being conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (Nimhans), Bengaluru, will cover adolescents aged 13-17 years and all adults above 18. The previous survey, carried out in 2015-16, had covered only 12 states.Data from the earlier NMHS underlined the scale of the challenge. NMHS 2015-16 found that 10.6% of adults in India suffered from mental disorders, with lifetime prevalence estimated at 13.7%. National studies have since indicated that nearly 15% of India's adult population experiences mental health conditions requiring clinical intervention. The burden was higher in urban areas at 13.5%, compared to 6.9% in rural regions.According to the health ministry, NMHS-2 will generate state-wise and national estimates of priority mental health conditions, assess disability and the social and economic burden on individuals and families, and track pathways to care and service utilisation.The survey will also include a comprehensive mapping of mental health services and resources across states and UTs.The scope of NMHS-2 has been widened to study vulnerable groups such as children, women, the elderly, migrants and tribal populations, and to examine the mental health impact of climate change, disasters and displacement.Health officials said the findings are expected to strengthen the National Mental Health Programme, guide allocation of resources and inform future policy decisions, particularly in underserved and high-risk regions.","National mental health survey-2 will cover adolescents aged 13-17 years and all adults above 18.

Nashik/Mumbai: NCP minister Manikrao Kokate was divested of all his ministerial portfolios on Wednesday, hours after a court in Nashik issued warrants for his and his brother Vijay's arrest in a 1995 EWS housing quota cheating case. A day earlier, a sessions court in Nashik upheld the trial court's Feb 20 judgment, convicting and sentencing the Kokate brothers to two years of rigorous imprisonment.Sources said CM Devendra Fadnavis wrote to governor Acharya Devvrat, recommending Kokate be divested of his portfolios (sports and youth welfare and minority development and aukaf) and that the portfolios be handed over to NCP chief and deputy CM Ajit Pawar. Devvrat issued a letter approving the CM's recommendation, sources said.Kokate, who is the MLA from Sinnar, is the second NCP politician after Dhananjay Munde to have faced action since the Mahayuti alliance formed govt in Nov 2024. Munde had to step down in March after the CM called for his resignation over allegations linking his associate Valmik Karad to the murder of Massajog sarpanch Santosh Deshmukh.While Nashik commissioner of police Sandeep Karnik said they had received a non-bailable warrant against Kokate and his brother, Bombay high court has posted the hearing of the minister's application for relief on Friday.Kokate got admitted to Mumbai's Leelavati Hospital on Wednesday.All these developments came on a day when a section of NCP functionaries said Kokate should resign. Though there has so far been no statement from NCP on Kokate's fate, the opposition said merely divesting him of portfolios was not enough and he should be disqualified with immediate effect.Earlier in the day, the court of additional chief judicial magistrate Rupali C Narwadiya in Nashik rejected Kokate's application citing medical grounds to seek four days to surrender and issued the arrest warrants.","Ncp minister manikrao kokate was divested of all his ministerial portfolios on wednesday.
