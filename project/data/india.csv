‘Guru Dakshina means flag’: Priyank Kharge levels ‘money laundering racket’ charge against RSS,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/guru-dakshina-means-flag-priyank-kharge-levels-money-laundering-racket-charge-against-rss/articleshow/128405383.cms,"NEW DELHI: Karnataka Minister Priyank Kharge on Sunday accused the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh of indulging in “money laundering”, questioned its sources of income and asked why it was not paying taxes.Addressing a gathering at an event here, Kharge alleged financial irregularities and sought greater accountability from the organisation.""It (RSS) has a network of more than 2,500 organisations, they are from America, England. They take money from them. I am telling -- that these people are into money laundering,"" he said.Questioning the source of its funds, he added, ""they want us to be good citizens, pay income tax, but they want to remain free. How is it possible. We will have to question this.""Kharge said the same law and Constitution applicable to everyone in the country should apply to the RSS as well. Later, speaking to reporters, he pointed out that the RSS is an unregistered organisation and asked whether ""they are above law or Constitution.""""It is good that all organisations should come under the ambit of law and constitution, whether it is RSS or any other organisations. Are they above law and constitution. Mohan Bhagwat (RSS chief) says it (RSS) is a body of individuals. So is Bangalore Club, have they not registered? Are they not paying taxes?"" he further asked.Stating that his question is why the RSS was unregistered, he said, ""Where is their Guru Dakshina (donation) coming from.""Kharge said, ""If we ask about the source of RSS money, they tell us that we will get Guru Dakshina. However, when I did some research, according to them, Guru Dakshina means 'flag'. So, tomorrow morning, if I also hoist the blue flag and collect money, I will ask the government and them (RSS) whether they will agree. Thus, no one can escape baseless words. From now on, I will not give up until this RSS organisation is registered under the Constitution and the law. """"Who is paying it? Why is it (RSS) not paying tax? When every rupee of others is being accounted for, why is there no accountability for their (RSS) money,"" he asked.Kharge also took a swipe at the organisation over patriotism, saying, ""RSS did not hoist the national flag in their office for 52 years. They teach us about patriotism.""""Ramayana, written by Valmiki, is different; what is happening now is different. Politicians and religious leaders are talking about religion as they wish. No religion incites violence. RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, who says that one should have three children, is not getting married. However, he talks about raising other people's children. Thus, the BJP is constantly saying things outside and inside, and is sending the children of the poor to the streets,"" Kharge said.Meanwhile, Kharge launched a sharp attack on the demand to confer the Bharat Ratna to Veer Savarkar, asking why a person who, according to him, ""worked against Bharat"" should receive the country's highest civilian honour.In a post shared on X, Kharge posted a long list of questions targeting Savarkar's role during the freedom struggle. His attack came in response to comments made by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on February 8, at a two-day lecture series titled '100 Years of Sangh Journey - New Horizons'. Addressing questions over the delay in honouring Savarkar, Bhagwat said the award would elevate the prestige of the Bharat Ratna itself. Bhagwat further said that he was not on the decision-making committee but would raise the issue if given the chance.",Karnataka minister priyank kharge accused the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh of indulging in “money laundering” he also questioned its sources of income and asked why it was not paying taxes.

"Gujarat, Maharashtra, UP lead rooftop solar figures",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarat-maharashtra-up-lead-rooftop-solar-figures/articleshow/128403876.cms,"NEW DELHI: Gujarat, Maharashtra and UP have emerged as frontrunners in rooftop solar installations, even as over 23 lakh rooftop solar systems (RTS) were installed across the country in the last two years under the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana.Launched on Feb 13, 2024, with a financial outlay of Rs 75,021 crore, the scheme aims to install RTS in one crore households by March 2027. The Centre provides a one-time financial assistance of up to Rs 78,000 per household, while several states offer additional subsidies.According to the national portal, 23,68,383 systems with an aggregate capacity of about 8,691 MW have been installed till Feb 13 this year. Govt has released Rs 16,932.4 crore in subsidies.Under the scheme, a 3-kW solar plant can generate about 300 units of electricity per month — enough to reduce the bill to zero if consumption stays within that limit. More than 12.5 lakh consumers have received zero electricity bills in at least one month since the launch.The number of installations is estimated to be close to three million when statelevel subsidy programmes are included.Gujarat leads with nearly 5.6 lakh installations, followed by Maharashtra (4.5 lakh), UP (3.7 lakh) and Kerala (1.9 lakh).Adoption remains low in the Northeast: Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and Tripura together account for only 4,174 installations. Delhi, Goa, West Bengal and Chandigarh also have recorded modest numbers, with 6,209, 1,721, 1,265 and 1,050 installations, respectively.Govt acknowledged that nearly three-fourths of installations are concentrated in 1011 states. Many states are yet to notify virtual net-metering guidelines that allow consumers to feed surplus power into the grid and receive payment. “This is a model with a customer-first approach. It has become immensely popular,” said JVN Subramanyam, joint secretary, ministry of new and renewable energy.","Gujarat leads with nearly 5.6 lakh installations, followed by maharashtra (4.5 lakh), up (3.7 lakh) and kerala (1.9 lakh).

UN Flags Jaish-e-Mohammed Role In Delhi Red Fort Attack Raises Alarm Over Masood Azhar's Women Wing

NEW DELHI: The “white-collar” terror module recently uncovered by J&K Police, in which several doctors were arrested, revealed that after being radicalised in 2016 they formed a new terror outfit called “Ansar Interim” to carry out subversive activities in the Union Territory and beyond, officials said on Sunday.The case is now being investigated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).The inter-state terror network first came to light after JeM posters appeared on walls in Bunpora, Nowgam, on the outskirts of Srinagar, on October 19. Srinagar police registered a case and analysed CCTV footage, leading to the arrest of three locals — Arif Nisar Dar alias Sahil, Yasir-ul-Ashraf, and Maqsood Ahmad Dar alias Shahid — all of whom had prior stone-pelting cases, reported PTI.Their interrogation led to the arrest of Maulvi Irfan Ahmad, a former paramedic turned Imam from Shopian, who allegedly supplied the posters and used his access to radicalise the doctors.Investigators later found that the accused doctors — Muzamil Gannie, Umer-un-Nabi (now dead), and Adeel Rather — along with his brother Muzzafar Rather (absconding), Maulvi Irfan, Qari Aamir, and Tufail Gazi had met at Eidgah in downtown Srinagar in April 2022.During this meeting, they decided to form the terror organisation “Ansar Interim,” naming Adeel as the ‘Ameer’ (chief), Maulvi Irfan as ‘Deputy Ameer,’ and Gannie as treasurer.Officials noted that among militant groups, “Ansar” is commonly associated with the globally banned terror outfit Al-Qaeda.The arrested doctors and preachers told interrogators that they formed a new group after losing contact with active terrorists. Roles and operational codes were assigned, with Umer taking charge as coordinator and, along with Gannie, handling finances and procurement.In 2023, the group began acquiring materials, including fertiliser from Sohna and Nuh in Haryana. On Umer’s instructions, NPK — commonly known as Potassium Nitrate in this context — was also purchased from a chemical shop in Faridabad.During interrogation, the arrested doctors said Umer watched online videos to learn rudimentary Improvised Explosive Device (IED) construction and managed to prepare Triacetone Triperoxide (TATP), a peroxide explosive used in several terrorist attacks as the filling for IEDs, as reported by PTI.Officials said Adeel began recruiting members and brought in an individual named Danish, alias Jasir, from South Kashmir. Adeel took him to a rented accommodation within Al-Falah University in Faridabad, where both saw Umer and Gannie preparing TATP explosive materials.Umer later tried to persuade Danish to carry out a ‘fidayeen’ (suicide) attack, but he backed out at the last minute, citing his poor economic condition and the belief that suicide was forbidden in Islam.Umer, a 28-year-old doctor from Pulwama, is believed to have been the most radicalised member and key operative in a network spanning Kashmir, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. Officials suspect he had been planning a powerful Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED) blast, intending to place it in a crowded location in the national capital or at a site of religious importance and then flee.However, the plot collapsed after Srinagar police arrested Gannie and seized explosives, prompting Umer to panic and leading to the premature blast outside the Red Fort on November 10, which killed over a dozen people. Investigators also found that Umer had earlier tried unsuccessfully to join terror groups in 2016 and 2018.","The inter-state terror network first came to light after jem posters appeared on walls in bunpora, nowgam, on the outskirts of srinagar, on october 19.

All About Northeast' First Emergency Landing Facility In Assam Which IAF Will Use During Wars

Assam is going to witness a historic moment on Saturday as Prime Minister Narendra Modi will land at the Emergency Landing Facility (ELF) on Moran Bypass in Dibrugarh, where he will witness the aerial display of fighters, transports and helicopters.The ELF is the first of its kind in Northeast India. It has been specially designed and constructed in coordination with the Indian Air Force to support the landing and take-off of military and civil aircraft during emergencies. It will serve as a critical asset for emergency response, enabling quick deployment of rescue and relief operations during natural disasters or strategic requirements in the Northeast.Envisioned as dual-use infrastructure, the ELF is capable of handling fighter aircraft up to 40 tonnes and transport aircraft up to 74 tonnes maximum take-off weight.PM Modi will also inaugurate and flag off development projects worth over Rs 5,450 crore, aimed at strengthening connectivity, digital infrastructure, higher education and urban mobility in the North-Eastern Region.According to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), around 10:30 AM, the PM will land at the Emergency Landing Facility (ELF) on Moran Bypass in Dibrugarh.At around 1 PM, the Prime Minister will inspect the newly built Kumar Bhaskar Varma Setu across the River Brahmaputra.Later, at approximately 1:30 PM, he will inaugurate and flag off development projects valued at over Rs 5,450 crore at Lachit Ghat in Guwahati.Further, PM Modi will inaugurate Kumar Bhaskar Varma Setu across the River Brahmaputra, built at a cost of around Rs 3,030 crore. The 6-lane extradosed Prestressed Concrete (PSC) bridge connects Guwahati with North Guwahati and is the first of its kind in Northeast India. It will cut travel time between Guwahati and North Guwahati to seven minutes.Given the region's high seismicity, the bridge incorporates base isolation using friction pendulum bearings. High-performance stay cables have been used to ensure durability and long-term structural performance.A Bridge Health Monitoring System (BHMS) has also been incorporated to enable real-time condition monitoring, early damage detection, and improved safety and service life of the extradosed bridge.According to the PMO, PM Modi will inaugurate the National Data Centre for the Northeastern region at Amingaon in Kamrup district of Assam. The state-of-the-art Data Centre, with a total sanctioned load of 8.5 MW and an average rack capacity of 10 kW, will host mission-critical applications for various government departments and serve as a Disaster Recovery centre for other National Data Centres.This will enable governments in the Northeast to digitally deliver essential citizen-centric services. Aligned with the vision of Digital India, the National Data Centre for the northeastern region has been envisioned as a strategic initiative to strengthen the region's ICT backbone and ensure robust, secure, and always-available digital infrastructure, according to the PMO's statement.The inauguration of the Indian Institute of Management is another highlight for the state, as the IIM Guwahati is set to provide a major boost to higher and management education in the North-Eastern Region.Over 225 electric buses under the PM-eBus Sewa Scheme in Guwahati (100), Nagpur (50), Bhavnagar (50), and Chandigarh (25) will also be flagged off. With the launch of e-bus operations under the PM-eBus Sewa Scheme in these four cities, more than 50 lakh citizens are expected to benefit from access to clean, affordable, and reliable public transport services, thereby improving urban mobility and enhancing quality of life.",Pm narendra modi will land at the emergency landing facility (elf) on moran bypass in dibrugarh.

NEW DELHI: At least nine people were injured on Sunday after a confrontation broke out between BJP and Congress workers in Pune during a protest over remarks made by Congress leader Harshwardhan Sapkal that allegedly equated Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj with Tipu Sultan.The clash took place outside the Congress Bhavan, where BJP workers had gathered to protest against Sapkal’s comments. The situation escalated into sloganeering and stone pelting from both sides, leading to minor injuries.Joint Commissioner of Police Ranjan Kumar Sharma said that three Congress workers, two BJP workers, two police personnel and two journalists were injured in the incident.""A protest was held near the Congress Bhavan, which saw sloganeering from workers of BJP and Congress. Workers of both parties climbed onto walls and there was stone pelting from both sides. Cases are being registered against workers of both sides,"" Sharma informed.Police deployed heavy security in the area to prevent further escalation.The controversy stems from Maharashtra Congress chief Harshwardhan Sapkal’s recent remarks, in which he referred to the valour of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and cited Tipu Sultan’s resistance against the British as being on similar lines.The comments triggered political backlash in the state.Speaking to reporters, Sapkal said: ""The kind of bravery that Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj possessed and the concept of 'Swarajya' (self-rule) that he introduced... much later, following in that very tradition and taking inspiration from his ideals, Tipu Sultan waged war against the British.""""In that sense, Tipu Sultan was a great warrior who displayed immense bravery and was a true son of India. He never allowed any poisonous or communal ideas to sway him. As a symbol of bravery, we should view Tipu Sultan as equivalent to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj,"" he added.A day earlier, a separate row had erupted over a portrait of Tipu Sultan displayed in the office of the deputy mayor of the Malegaon Municipal Corporation, which was opposed by Shiv Sena corporators and Hindu outfits.Pune city Congress chief Arvind Shinde said that the party has submitted a written complaint against BJP functionaries and demanded action.He said a case should be registered against Mayor Manjusha Nagpure, BJP city president Dheeraj Ghate, Dushyant Mohol and other workers.Speaking to PTI, Maharashtra Congress vice-president Mohan Joshi alleged that BJP workers initiated the violence.""During the protest, stones were pelted at Congress workers and two sustained injuries. We are currently holding a sit-in protest outside the police station in Shivajinagar seeking action,"" he said.Krishikesh Rawale, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone 1), said that police intervened promptly to prevent the situation from worsening.Meanwhile, BJP Pune city unit president Dheeraj Ghate lodged a complaint against Sapkal at Parvati police station for allegedly hurting Hindu sentiments. A FIR has been registered.The political exchange intensified as Maharashtra Congress leader Sachin Sawant accused the BJP of “double standards” and pursuing a polarisation agenda.In a statement, Sawant cited past instances where BJP leaders had supported references to 18th-century Mysuru ruler Tipu Sultan in public spaces and official forums. He referred to resolutions passed in civic bodies in Akola and Mumbai and alleged that BJP leaders had earlier praised or associated with the historical figure.""What should this hypocrisy be called? Tipu Sultan used to wear a ring bearing the name of Lord Ram,"" he claimed.Sawant alleged that the BJP was now portraying Tipu Sultan negatively to create religious divisions and engage in “distorted religious politics”.He further cited examples, including a 2012 resolution in the Akola Municipal Corporation to name a hall after Tipu Sultan, a 2013 proposal supported by BJP corporators to name a road in Mumbai, and a 2001 road naming in Andheri (West).He also claimed that former Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa had visited Tipu Sultan’s tomb and written words of praise and that then President Ram Nath Kovind had praised Tipu Sultan in the Karnataka Assembly in 2017.","Clash took place outside the congress bhavan, where bjp workers had gathered.

He asked what the fate will be of soya farmers in MP, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and other states of the country if India imports GM soya oil from the US, and if farmers will survive “another price shock”.He asked the PM to clarify what comprises “additional products” mentioned in the statement for reduction or elimination of tariffs. “Does it signal pressure to open up pulses and other sensitive crops to US imports over time?” the Congress MP asked. Referring to the proposed import of DDG, Rahul asked if feeding Indian cattle the distillers grain made of GM American corn will not “effectively integrate our dairy chain with the US agricultural system”.Rahul also urged the PM to clarify if removing “non tariff barriers” implies that India will be pushed to dilute its stand against GM crops, weaken procurement, or undermine MSP and bonuses in the future.","Rahul asked if provisions in the interim trade deal suggests that india will be importing pulses and grains.

Lok Sabha may take up opposition's notice against Speaker Om Birla on March 9,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lok-sabha-may-take-up-oppositions-notice-against-speaker-om-birla-on-march-9/articleshow/128400786.cms,"NEW DELHI: The opposition's notice for a resolution for Speaker Om Birla’s removal is likely to be taken up in Lok Sabha on the first day of the Budget session ’s second part on March 9, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said on Sunday, as govt looks to get on with its legislative agenda in the sitting after disposing of the move against the chair.As the BJP-led NDA has 293 members in the 542-member House and is likely to draw support of several fence-sitters, the opposition’s bid for Birla’s ouster for his alleged partiality looks set to fall through.“On March 9 in Lok Sabha, we will have the debate on the no-confidence motion moved against the Speaker. There will be a vote following the debate,” Rijiju told TOI .Official sources said the governing NDA is keen to deal with the issue urgently so that Birla, who has decided to not attend the House till the notice is dealt with, could return to preside over proceedings in the crucial session.Govt’s decision to send Birla for the swearing-in ceremony of BNP leader Tarique Rahman as Bangladesh PM on Feb 17 is being seen as signalling govt’s combative support for the Speaker who attracted Congress’s wrath for saying that the party had planned to deploy its women contingent in LS to do something unprecedentedly indecorous against PM Narendra Modi during his speech on the motion of thanks to the President’s address.The lead up to the vote will see Congress making an effort to get TMC and AAP to support the anti-Birla move. Congress is learnt to have dangled the carrot of a motion to remove chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar as a quid pro quo. TMC has been on the warpath against against the CEC over the Special Intense Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in poll-bound West Bengal.Talking to PTI in Arunachal Pradesh, Rijiju expressed hope that Congress and other opposition parties would allow Parliament to function, but made it clear that the govt will carry on with its legislative agenda, noting that the Finance Bill will have to be passed. The Appropriation Bill will also be passed during the session.Amid deepening acrimony between the treasury and opposition benches, govt has at times got its key bills passed amid uproar, insisting that governance cannot be allowed to be obstructed by disruptions.BJP MP Nishikant Dubey’s notice for taking up a motion for expulsion of the leader of opposition in LS, Rahul Gandhi , is also likely to figure on the session’s agenda. If the issue is mentioned in the House, it is bound to face massive protests from opposition parties.Rijiju termed the next part of the session interesting, noting that it coincides with the upcoming assembly elections in four states and a Union Territory — West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry.“We will bring some important bills, including one critical bill. We will not disclose now as to what the bill is, but we will bring up one very important business in the second part. We will pass all these bills,” he said.","The opposition's notice for a resolution for speaker om birla’s removal is likely to be taken up in lok sabha on the first day of the budget session ’s second part on march 9.

This exposes the harsh truth: J&K’s representation has been reduced to symbolism, while its people are denied their rightful share,” governing National Conference spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq said.Khatana, who joined the BJP in 2008 and was nominated to the Rajya Sabha in 2022 from Jammu region, is a native of Jammu.Under the MPLAD scheme, nominated Rajya Sabha members are permitted to recommend development works in any state or district across the country. Using the scheme, Khatana recommended 139 development projects in Shahjahanpur, three in Pilibhit, one in Chandauli and one in Badaun in UP.In Jammu and Kashmir, he recommended 17 projects for Jammu district, six for Samba, one for Kathua, six for Poonch and two for Rajouri.PDP spokesperson Aditya Gupta said, “He entered Parliament from J&K, but his development funds went to UP. This is the BJP model.

NEW DELHI: The Mumbai Port Authority (MPA) and the New Mangalore Port Authority (NMPA) are still awaiting the delivery of three patrol boats, more than eight months beyond the maximum stipulated timeline under their contracts. In the case of two other major ports — Paradip and VO Chidambarnar, two such boats were delivered late.The four major port authorities awarded these contracts to Mumbai-based Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works Ltd. Patrol boats for ports are specialized, fast, and agile vessels designed for security, surveillance, and law enforcement in harbours and coastal areas.The four major port authorities awarded these works to Mumbai-based Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works LtdThe MPA awarded a tender to the firm in September 2024 to hire two fully operational patrol boats for deployment over seven years. The boats were scheduled to be delivered by March 23, 2025, but the company failed to meet the deadline.Last month, the port authority issued a termination notice to the company, citing its failure to provide substitute patrol boats with similar technical specifications during the period of non-availability or delay. The letter, dated January 8, 2026, also stated that the delay had caused a loss of Rs 35 lakh to the port authority.The company was asked to confirm compliance by January 20, failing which the contract could be terminated.The MPA did not respond to repeated queries regarding the status of the contract.Similarly, the NMPA awarded a contract to the same firm in August 2024 for hiring one patrol boat, with delivery scheduled for May 2025. The company was permitted a delayed delivery until July 2025, subject to the maximum applicable liquidated damages. However, the boat has still not been delivered.A senior NMPA official said the contracted cost of the patrol boat was Rs 9.7 crore, and it remains undelivered. The port authority has also not terminated the contract despite the delay.Sources in the ports and shipping ministry said that since port authorities are empowered to take decisions regarding contracts and operations, they are responsible for initiating appropriate action.","The mumbai port authority and the new mangalore port authority are still awaiting the delivery of three patrol boats.

Amit Shah’s 'Tamil Apology' In Focus As Stalin Speaks Tamil Without Apology In Bihar

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Karti Chidambaram on Sunday dismissed allegations that Tamil Nadu is “hostile” to Sanatan Dharma, contending instead that people in the state are “more Hindu than North Indians.”The BJP has frequently accused the Congress, its ally the ruling DMK in Tamil Nadu, and their other INDIA bloc partners of being “anti-Sanatan Dharma.” The political attack stems from controversial past remarks by Udhayanidhi Stalin , son of Tamil Nadu chief minister and DMK supremo MK Stalin. Udhyanidhi now serves as the state's deputy chief minister.“What is Sanatan? That is not a term anyone in Tamil Nadu uses… We are more Hindu than North Indians. Per square kilometre, we have more temples. We break more coconuts every day. I personally visit more temples than many people in the BJP combined,” Chidambaram told ANI.“There isn’t a single day that I step out of my house without applying vibhuti or kundalama. ‘Sanatan Dharma’ is not a phrase we use,” he added.Addressing the controversy sparked in 2023 by remarks from Udhayanidhi Stalin, the Sivaganga MP attributed the uproar to “differing interpretations” of the term.“This issue became controversial because Udhayanidhi Stalin made a comment about the term. In Tamil Nadu, it is understood to refer to caste hierarchy—that’s how it is commonly interpreted here. He was speaking about caste hierarchy, not about the practice of the Hindu faith,” Chidambaram stated.In 2023, Udhayanidhi had likened “Sanatana” to diseases such as malaria and dengue, saying it should be “eradicated” rather than merely opposed, triggering a nationwide political debate.He had remarked, “Sanatana is like malaria and dengue, and therefore it must be eradicated, not just opposed. I thank the organisers for naming this event the ‘Sanatana Abolition Conference’ instead of the ‘Anti-Sanatana Conference.’ Some things cannot simply be opposed; they must be abolished. We don’t oppose dengue, mosquitoes, malaria, or corona—we eradicate them. In the same way, Sanatana should be eradicated rather than opposed. ”Tamil Nadu is set to hold assembly elections in April. Although the Congress is an ally of the DMK, it is not part of the state government, in line with the prevailing political practice in the southern state.","Congress mp karti chidambaram dismisses allegations that tamil nadu is “hostile’ to sanatan dharma.

'White Collar Terrorism...': Ex-DGMO AK Bhatt On Biggest Challenge For The Army In Jammu & Kashmir

Security agencies in Jammu and Kashmir have identified and frozen over 8,000 “mule accounts” in the past three years.According to the officials, these accounts form the financial backbone of global scam networks and could fund separatist and anti-national activities.Officials described these accounts as the “weakest yet most crucial link” in the cybercrime chain, noting that without them, stolen money could not be converted into untraceable cryptocurrency , news agency PTI reported.Central security agencies have asked the Jammu and Kashmir Police and other law-enforcement bodies to consult with banks to curb the rise of mule accounts and identify middlemen commonly called “mulers” who facilitate these frauds.After the National Investigation Agency ’s 2017 crackdown on illicit money flows into the region, officials said anti-national elements may have shifted to a “digital hawala” model, where commissions earned by mule account holders could be used for activities against the country.A muler typically does not contact victims or send fraudulent links. Instead, officials said, their role is arranging and maintaining a steady supply of mule accounts for scammers while concealing their identities.Such accounts often belong to ordinary individuals lured with promises of “easy commission” and minimal risk. They are persuaded to give full control of their bank accounts, including their net banking credentials.Investigators found that a single scammer may be supplied with 10 to 30 mule accounts at a time. In several cases, accounts are opened in the names of fictitious companies, enabling large transactions of up to Rs 40 lakh in a single day without immediately raising alarms.Officials said the money trail is deliberately complex, with funds quickly shifted across multiple accounts and broken into smaller transactions to avoid detection.Law-enforcement agencies stressed that even if mule account holders do not design scams or interact with victims, they remain active facilitators of money laundering. “The entire scam ecosystem depends on these accounts. Without a destination for the money, the scam fails at the first step. Those renting out their accounts are not just victims of circumstance; they are the engines of the crime,” a senior official said.A study by central security agencies also found individuals in countries such as China, Malaysia, Myanmar and Cambodia directing people in the Union Territory to create private crypto wallets. These wallets are often set up using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to avoid detection and requiring no Know Your Customer (KYC) verification. The J&K police have already suspended the use of VPNs in the Valley, noting that terrorists and separatists often exploit the technology to evade tracking, PTI reported.","Security agencies in jammu and kashmir have identified and frozen over 8,000 “mule accounts” in the past three years.

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday said that central projects worth around Rs 55,000 crore have been sanctioned for the state over the past year, marking significant progress on infrastructure commitments made earlier.Addressing a press conference, Sarma outlined a series of projects that have either received approval or are in advanced stages of clearance. He linked the developments to the commitments made during the second Advantage Assam investment summit.""The Centre had assured infrastructure projects worth Rs 80,000 crore during the second Advantage Assam investment summit last year, and the state has already received approval for different projects worth Rs 55,000 crore,"" he said.The ‘Advantage Assam 2.0 Investment and Infrastructure Summit’ was organised by the state government in February 2025 to attract investments and push major infrastructure expansion across the state.Among the key projects, Sarma said that the government has floated the tender for the Kamakhya Ropeway Project, which will connect Kamakhya railway station to the Kamakhya temple in Guwahati.""When the PM visits Assam next, he will lay the foundation for it,"" he said.He added that the Centre is likely to approve a Rs 1,500 crore project within the next few days to build an elevated corridor from Guwahati airport to Jalukbari, the main entry point to the state capital. The project is aimed at easing traffic congestion and improving connectivity.Sarma also said that a major highway expansion project is nearing final approval.""The Rs 14,000-crore project for four-laning of the national highway from Baihata Chariali to Tezpur is at last stages of approval. We hope for it very soon,"" he added.On the stalled Kamakhya corridor project, the Chief Minister said work is expected to resume soon after expert bodies found no ecological risks.""After some people opposed the corridor, the Gauhati High Court asked IIT Guwahati and the National Institute of Hydrology to study if the project would have any ecological impact. They said there would be no impact,"" he claimed.In the healthcare sector, Sarma said expansion works worth Rs 2,200 crore are underway at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital, while projects worth Rs 600 crore are ongoing at Assam Medical College and Hospital.He further said that another strategic highway project is under consideration. The proposed route will connect the semiconductor plant at Jagiroad in Morigaon district to the Bhutan border via Udalguri and will include construction of a new bridge over the Brahmaputra river.""This project is under active consideration of the Centre. These strategic assets will also be used by civilians,"" Sarma said.Separately, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister, on Friday approved the construction of India’s first 34-km-long twin-tube road-cum-rail tunnel under the Brahmaputra river between Gohpur and Numaligarh at a cost of Rs 18,662 crore.","Assam chief minister himanta biswa sarma said that central projects worth around rs 55,000 crore have been sanctioned for the state over the past year.

‘I Challenge Rahul Gandhi’: Amit Shah Slams Cong For ‘Misleading Farmers’ On India-US Trade Deal

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Sunday continued his attacks on the Centre over the India–US trade deal, reiterating his charge that the PM Modi-led government has “betrayed farmers” in the name of the agreement. He also posed some “straightforward questions” directly to the prime minister.However, Union home minister Amit Shah hit back at Rahul, accusing the Congress leader of “spreading lies” about India’s recent trade deals with the United States and the European Union In a lengthy post on X, the former Congress president raised five questions addressed to PM Modi . He wrote:1. “What does importing DDG actually mean? Does it mean that Indian livestock will be fed distillers’ grain made from GM American maize? Won’t this effectively make our dairy products dependent on the American agricultural industry?”2. “If we allow imports of GM soya oil, what will happen to our soya farmers in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and across the country? How will they cope with yet another price shock?”3. “When you say ‘additional products’, what exactly does that include? Is this a sign of future pressure to open up pulses and other crops to American imports over time?”4. “What does removing ‘non-trade barriers’ mean? Will there be pressure on India in future to loosen its stance on GM crops, weaken procurement, or reduce MSP and bonuses?”5. “Once this door is open, how will we stop it from opening wider every year? Will there be safeguards, or will more and more crops be gradually put on the table in every deal?”He added that farmers deserve clarity on these issues.Rahul ended his post by raising a broader concern about India’s sovereign decision-making in trade matters, saying: “This isn’t just about today. It’s about the future too – are we allowing another country to gain long-term control over India’s agricultural industry?”Meanwhile, Amit Shah, speaking at the launch event of Gujarat’s Central Bank Digital Currency, said: “He (Rahul Gandhi) is misleading people about the FTA with the European Union and the UK, and claiming that the trade agreement with the United States has harmed farmers’ interests.I want to challenge Rahul Gandhi: set up any platform, and the president of the BJP’s youth wing will come and debate with you on who has actually caused harm. ”Dismissing the Congress leader’s criticism of the India–US trade pact as “laughable lies” aimed at misleading rural voters, Shah asserted that the agreements have been carefully structured to protect core agricultural interests while expanding India’s global trade footprint.He added: “Today, I have come to this platform to tell the farmers of the country that Rahul Gandhi is lying; he is misleading them. In the FTAs with the UK and the European Union, and the trade deal with the US, farmers have been fully protected by PM Modi. No one needs to worry.”","Lok sabha leader of opposition rahul gandhi continued his attacks on the centre over the india–us trade deal.

""While talking to reporters, Tagore reiterated that Congress is in alliance with DMK and a committee, for seat sharing talks, will be formed on the 22nd February.""We are not like other parties that switch directions after merely putting on an indicator and turning right. We are a national party with principles. We are in an alliance with the DMK as part of the INDIA bloc,"" Tagore said.""It has been 70 days since we were told that a committee would be formed for talks, and we are still waiting. They have now said that the committee will be formed on the 22nd February. We believe that we will receive the respect that is due to us,"" he added.Earlier on Saturday, Tagore pushed his party's demand for a larger share of seats in its alliance with the DMK.He said the Congress was seeking constituencies that the DMK had lost in the 2021 polls and emphasised that ""power-sharing was essential"" in state's governance. However, days earlier, Stalin ruled out the possibility of sharing power with allies.Tagore’s remarks came in response to comments made by DMK leader and state minister RS Raja Kannappan in Madurai on February 13, where he asserted that the DMK would contest 170 constituencies and win 160 seats in the upcoming election.Reacting to the statement, Tagore, the MP from Virudhunagar, said in a post on X: “In 2021, you contested in 173 seats and secured 133. What we are asking (now) are the seats which you failed to win.”He further underlined the Congress’s position on governance, saying, “Power sharing is necessary. The share in power is our right. The people will decide,” while sharing a video clip of Raja Kannappan’s speech.In the video, Raja Kannappan ruled out the possibility of a coalition government, expressing confidence that the DMK would independently secure 160 seats.Days earlier, CM Stalin strongly ruled out sharing power with allies, while maintaining that the alliance with the Congress remained “intact” and free of confusion.“We also know that it will not work in Tamil Nadu; they (Congress) know it too. It is a problem created by some people. They are deliberately conspiring to see if there will be a rift in the alliance. We are not worried about it. Rahul Gandhi is not worried either,” Stalin said.The Tamil Nadu assembly has 234 seats, and the DMK-Congress alliance had won 151 seats in the 2021 elections.","Congress mp manickam tagore refuted speculations about a rift between dmk and the grand-old party.
