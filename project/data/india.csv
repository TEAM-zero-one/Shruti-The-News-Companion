Thiruvalluvar envisioned a world where justice was a balance beam, not a weapon — where the ruler, the ruled, and even the voiceless stood on equal ground. But what happens when power begins to decide what is right?The following quote, often misattributed as a dialogue by Marlon Brando in the movie, has always stayed with me:“When you hold a gun and I hold a gun, we can talk about law. If you hold a knife and I hold a knife, we can talk about rules. If we both are empty handed, we can talk about reason. But if you have a gun and I only have a knife, then the truth lies in your hands. The concepts of law and rules hold meaning only when they rest on equality.”It is a chilling reflection — that law has meaning only when force stands equal. Fiction or not, it mirrors reality uncomfortably well.In a case that drew significant public attention, the wealthy accused in a fatal BMW car crash in Delhi was reportedly taken to a distant hospital where her father was a director, instead of a nearby one.Power dislikes being questioned. In a society divided between the powerful and the powerless, rules stop being rules — they become tools for the strong and chains for the weak.I was reminded of this fragile balance a few years ago during a visit to London. Our team was invited for lunch by a wealthy business magnate who later offered to drop us at Heathrow airport. When we stepped outside, a gleaming black Rolls Royce stood waiting — my first ride in one.At Heathrow, where vehicles are allowed to halt barely for a minute, our chauffeur parked calmly, helped us unload, and even offered to walk us inside. I asked, “Won’t the police fine you for waiting here?” He smiled politely and said nothing.I realised how deeply power infiltrates even the most rule-bound societies. When money speaks, rules go silent.And then my mind turned to a story from— one that shows what justice once meant in our land.In the 12th-century classic, among the 63 Nayanmaars stands, a Chola king whose very name became a byword for righteousness. One day, the king’s son was driving his chariot when a calf darted across and was crushed under its wheels. The grieving mother cow went to the palace and rang the— the bell of inquiry the king had installed to hear the cries of those wronged. It was the first time that bell had ever been rung.The minister examined the case and cleverly shifted the blame, declaring that the calf was at fault for straying into the chariot’s path. But the king, the guardian of justice, refused such a convenient solution. “If a mother is grieving in my land, justice demands that I share her pain,” he said and ordered that his own son be given the same fate as the calf. The prince was executed — and legend says divine grace restored both the calf and the prince to life.An ideal society indeed — where the voiceless and the mighty were treated as equals.Today, such stories read like distant echoes. We have laws and law enforcement agencies— yet the truth still bends before status, wealth, or influence. Thiruvalluvar’s call for impartiality remains not merely a virtue, but a test of civilization itself.","Thirukkural is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality.

Enforcement Directorate names senior advocate accused in Religare laundering case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/enforcement-directorate-names-senior-advocate-accused-in-religare-laundering-case/articleshow/124467800.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: On June 20, after protests from lawyers representing several bar associations, ED was forced to withdraw summons issued to senior advocate Pratap Venugopal in connection with a money laundering probe against Religare's former chairperson Rashmi Saluja.Four months later, the agency has named Venugopal as one of the accused, along with Saluja, in its chargesheet filed in the Religare Enterprises case before a special court in Mumbai for his role in the alleged conspiracy in illegal allotment of employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) of CHIL (Care Health Insurance Ltd), a subsidiary of Religare, in which Venugopal was an independent director and Saluja was non-executive chairperson.When contacted by TOI, Venugopal said he has ""no comments to offer"".Saluja, according to the chargesheet, has been described as the ""principal architect of the conspiracy"", who, in connivance with other former executives of the company Nitin Aggarwal, Nishant Singhal, Pratap Venugopal and Vaibhav Gawli, illegally acquired equity interest in CHIL through ESOPs. ED has termed the ESOPs thus acquired as ""proceeds of crime"" and has claimed that this was done to gain control of the company by subverting regulatory mechanisms.About the role of Venugopal, ED says he was then a retainer in Religare and had sought legal opinion on how to overturn rejection of allotment of ESOPs by regulator Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI). ED says, in return for his services, the lawyer was offered an independent director's post in CHIL and a remuneration of Rs 60 lakh.IRDAI had later directed CHIL to revoke or cancel any ESOPs allotted and also imposed a penalty of Rs 1 crore on CHIL for non-compliance with regulatory directions.The agency said 2.2 crore ESOPs were allotted to Saluja at an undervalued price of Rs 45.3 when the shares were at Rs 110 each. Later, the accused made office assistant Vaibhav Gawli to file an FIR against Burmans of Dabur, who had acquired 51% stake in the company, to prevent them from taking control of Religare.The summons to Venugopal and another senior advocate had generated sharp reactions from various bar associations, including joint pleas filed by SC Bar Association and SC Advocates-on-Record, senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Vijay Hansaria before the CJI-led bench of B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran while it was hearing a suo motu case regarding the summons.The bench had said it would frame guidelines for agencies and bar them from summoning advocates for legal opinion or advice rendered to clients facing prosecution.","Ed was forced to withdraw summons issued to senior advocate pratap venugopal in connection with a money laundering probe against religare's former chairperson rashmi saluja.

NMC data shows India added just 21 docs in a year when 80k graduated,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nmc-data-shows-india-added-just-21-docs-in-a-year-when-80k-graduated/articleshow/124467765.cms,"The health ministry recently told Parliament that the National Medical Commision (NMC) data shows there are 13,86,157 registered doctors in India, a number that is almost identical to the 13,86,136 it cited in the Lok Sabha in Aug last year. So, how could India have added just 21 doctors over the past year despite about 80,000 graduating in that period? Cross-checking the state-wise NMC data given last year with the state councils' rolls shows a glaring mismatch.Delhi had less than 31,500 doctors in NMC data, whereas state council data for 2020 showed more than 72,600. How did more than 40,000 doctors go missing in NMC's data for the city?Last year, NMC submitted that Kerala Medical Council has over 73,000 doctors registered with it. However, a Kerala council member told TOI the number is over 1 lakh, a difference of 36,000.Similarly, while NMC reported under 1.5 lakh in Tamil Nadu, the state council's figures are over 2 lakh.""This is not a clerical slip or a marginal miscalculation. It is a glaring 41,000-doctor gap between what the Delhi Medical Council (DMC) officially recorded and what union health ministry or NMC told Parliament. Placing incorrect, misleading or incomplete information before the Lok Sabha is a breach of Parliamentary privilege.It obstructs Members of Parliament from performing their duties, and as per Parliamentary procedure, such misrepresentation amounts to contempt of the House,"" said Dr Arun Kumar, national general secretary of United Doctors Front (UDF).UDF had filed an RTI asking for data on registered medical practitioners in Delhi. DMC responded that in 2014, the total number of registered voters for the council election was 57,749, and it was 72,636 for the 2020 elections. ""Only those who have renewed their registration can vote for the council election. So, 72,636 is authentic data as of 2020,"" said Dr Kumar. With a few hundred new registrations every year, this number ought to be even higher now.Huge variations between the actual registrations in state councils and what is submitted by NMC skew the calculation of the doctor-to-population ratio. In Delhi's case, NMC's data is over 66% less than DMC's count. In the case of Kerala, it is off by 33%.""For Delhi, a city with one of the highest patient inflows in the country, undercounting by 40,000 doctors distorts the entire healthcare planning process. They are planning to bring in compulsory bond in Delhi medical colleges, claiming doctor shortage. If they cannot get the Delhi data right, one can only wonder about other states,"" said Dr Kumar.In Sept 2020 NMC replaced erstwhile Medical Council of India, which was labelled corrupt and non-transparent in its functioning. However, five years later NMC has failed in its basic function of maintaining an updated medical registry crucial for decision-making.""NMC is totally defunct. Appointments are not made on time. Most posts have been lying vacant for more than a year. They don't even respond to communication from state councils. There has been no process to update their database or to bring in a system by which additions to the state councils will lead to automatic updation of NMC's registry,"" said a Kerala Council member.","The health ministry recently told parliament that the national medical commision (nmc) data shows there are 13,86,157 registered doctors in india.

KOLKATA: Pregnant Bengal resident Sunali Khatun, disowned as an ""illegal immigrant"" in India and incarcerated in Bangladesh for unlawful entry after being identified as an Indian by her Aadhaar card, could be returning soon to where she and her unborn child belong.A judicial magistrate's court in Bangladesh has asked the Indian high commission in Dhaka to initiate diplomatic and legal procedures to ""safely repatriate"" Sunali and five others languishing in a Chapai Nawabganj jail since Aug 22, capping an almost four-month ordeal that began with the group from Birbhum being targeted by Delhi Police and pushed across the international border in Assam on June 26.The Sept 30 magisterial directive specifies that all six jail inmates - Sunali, her husband Danish Sk, their 8-year-old son Sabir, Sweeti Bibi and her two sons - are ""Indian citizens"" with Aadhaar cards in their names.The order came within four days of Calcutta high court slammed Delhi Police for their haste in branding them illegal immigrants and pushing them into Bangladesh. The court gave the Centre four weeks to bring the group back to India.Sunali, who is due any day, her husband and Sweeti were eking out a living as ragpickers in the national capital when they were picked up by a police team engaged in a drive against illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.Sunali's father Bhodu Sk, who filed a habeas corpus in Calcutta high court in July, accused police of refusing to acknowledge the citizenship documents of his daughter and the rest of the group.Rajya Sabha MP Samirul Islam of Trinamool Congress , who heads the West Bengal Migrant Workers' Welfare Board, said on Friday that he would request the Union govt to fast-track steps to repatriate the group.An Indian official suggested repatriation might be a lengthier process than expected. ""An Aadhaar card is not proof of Indian citizenship. The identities of all six need to be established first,"" he told TOI.A flag meeting between BSF and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGP) will follow since the latter would need to hand them over to officials on this side,"" the Indian official added.Mofijul Sk, a social worker from Birbhum who has been camping at Chapai Nawabganj to coordinate legal assistance for the jailed six, said he would meet officials at the Indian deputy high commission in Rajshahi, if required, to speed up the process.Mofijul spoke to Sunali over the phone on Friday. ""She was crying and pleaded with me to arrange for the group to return home. She kept asking, 'How long will we have to stay here? What is our fault? Please tell them I have a daughter waiting for me at home',"" Mofijul said.He said Sunali suffered an injury in a fall in jail a week ago but was still to get a precautionary ultrasound to check her baby's health.Lawyer Saikat Thakurata, who represented Sunali's family at Calcutta HC, said he had ""heard"" about a Bangladeshi court directing India to safely repatriate her and the rest of the jailed group. ""Diplomatic issues are involved here. I am not sure when she will return home,"" he said.MP Islam posted on X, ""A Bangladeshi court has not only declared them Indian citizens but even cited their Aadhaar card numbers and residential addresses as proof. The court's order has been officially sent to the Indian high commission in Dhaka, directing that all of them be safely sent back to India.

SC questions TN on nod to Vijay’s party to hold Karur rally

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday questioned the manner in which a single judge of the Madras High Court - principal bench in Chennai - passed an order for a probe by an SIT into Karur stampede, when the petition it was responding to was for framing a standard operating protocol for political rallies.There is also fallacy in the order as the division bench of the high court at Madurai was examining the issue, it said.A bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and N V Anjaria asked why the principal bench entertained the petition related to the incident in Karur which falls within the jurisdiction of the Madurai bench. The court highlighted the procedural fault before going ahead with the hearing on a batch of petitions, including one filed by Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), on the stampede during TVK leader Vijay 's rally that killed 41 people.SC also questioned Tamil Nadu for allowing TVK to hold the rally in Karur when AIADMK was denied permission to hold one there. It also asked how the postmortem of victims of the Karur stampede was conducted at midnight and completed within four hours. The state govt has been directed to respond to the court's queries.Senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, appearing for TVK, submitted that the petition filed before the HC was for a limited purpose - to frame SOP for political rallies - but SIT was constituted by the court on the first day of hearing itself.He also said many adverse observations were passed against Vijay which were factually wrong.Subramanium said while the actor was forced by state police to leave the spot, the HC had wrongly said he absconded and abandoned his fans.Expressing apprehension that the SIT, composing of state officials, would not conduct a fair probe in the case, TVK submitted that the investigation must be conducted under the supervision of a retired SC judge. Its plea was, however, strongly objected by senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi, AM Singhvi and P Wilson who submitted that it was not the state but the HC which had suggested the composition of the SIT. They said that the state govt has no axe to grind against anyone and it was not proper to question the impartiality of the SIT probe. The state also opposed a CBI probe in the case and told the bench that bringing the central agency to investigate the matter would undermine the federal structure.Responding to the court's observation about the speedy conduct of postmortems, Wilson said this was an incident of tragedy and there was a lot of hue and cry because families started demanding the dead bodies and 606 doctors and nurses were mobilised on that fateful day.","Supreme court questions manner in which a single judge of the madras high court - principal bench in chennai - passed an order for a probe by an sit into karur stampede.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party and Janata Dal (United)-led National Democratic Alliance have a 40 per cent chance of retaining power in the upcoming Bihar election, an opinion poll by C Voter predicted on Friday.According to the poll, Rashtriya Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan came a close second with 38.3 per cent chance of forming the government. Meanwhile, the new entrant in Bihar politics, Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj, came third in the preference list with 13.3 per cent.The scenario, however, changes when it comes to the preferred choice for chief minister. RJD scion Tejashwi Yadav emerged as the most popular face, securing 36.5% support in the opinion polls.He was followed by Prashant Kishor with 23.2%, incumbent chief minister Nitish Kumar with 15.9%, and Chirag Paswan with 8.8%.When asked who can solve Bihar’s problems, 36.5% of respondents chose the Mahagathbandhan, 12.8% opted for Jan Suraaj, 34.3% preferred the NDA, while 9.4% felt that no one could.Earlier, Tejashwi promised a government job for every household in Bihar and pledged to introduce the legislation within just 20 days of taking office.""NDA government could not provide jobs to the youth in 20 years, but we will bring the Act within 20 days of coming to power and also ensure its implementation within 20 months,"" Tejashwi told reporters at his residence.This comes as parties have geared up for what the Election Commission has called the ""mother of elections.""Seat-sharing talks are in the final stages on all sides. However, constituents of the NDA and the INDIA bloc are grappling with differences over seat-sharing, with smaller allies in both camps jostling for more seats.Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj party declared a list of 51 candidates on Thursday.Amid growing unease in the ruling NDA over the seat sharing, senior BJP leader and Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan reached Patna on Friday and will hold meetings with senior party leaders.According to news agency PTI, sources in the BJP said that the seat-sharing arrangements within the NDA will be finalized in a day or two, and the party will release its first list of candidates soon after that.The JD(U), another alliance partner of the NDA, is also expected to announce its list of candidates very soon, party sources said.According to sources in the NDA, the allies — JD(U) and BJP — are likely to contest 102 and 101 seats, respectively.Union minister Chirag Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), which had earlier settled for around 20–22 seats, is now asking for 45 segments, they said.In the opposition bloc, sources said the RJD is likely to contest 135–140 seats.The party has offered the Congress 50–52 seats, lower than the party’s demand for 70 assembly segments.Sources in the RJD said a meeting of senior party leaders will take place in Patna later in the day to finalize the list of its candidates.In the 2020 assembly polls, the Congress had fought 70 seats but won only 19.The other big constituent of the INDIA bloc, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation, also appeared unhappy with the reportedly 20–25 seats being offered to it.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar Assembly elections. The 243 Assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the counting of votes scheduled to take place on November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, while there were 7.89 crore electors as of June 24 this year. An Election Commission press release stated that 65 lakh voters were removed from the draft list, and the number of electors in the draft list as of August 1, 2025, stood at 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly election, BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share with a strike rate of 43.2%. The Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with a 15.7% vote share and a 33.5% strike rate.

Centre in Supreme Court: In talks with J&K government on statehood restoration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-in-supreme-court-in-talks-with-jk-government-on-statehood-restoration/articleshow/124465249.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Centre on Friday informed Supreme Court that it is in consultation with the elected government of J&K - which was divided into UTs of J&K and Ladakh alongside scrapping of the contentious Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019 - on the issue of restoration of statehood without disturbing the UT status of Ladakh.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Chief Justice of India B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran that elections were held peacefully in the UT and an elected government is in place. However, restoration of statehood is under consideration of the Union government, which is consulting the UT government. ""The Centre will respond to the pleas for restoration of statehood to J&K in four weeks,"" he said.SC adjourned hearing on a bunch of pleas, including those filed by lecturer Zahoor Ahmed Bhat, sitting MLA Irfan Hafiz Lone, Prem Shankar Jha and Radha Kumar, who was one of the three interlocutors for J&K appointed by the UPA government's Cabinet Committee on Security in 2010.Senior advocates Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for Bhat, said SC while upholding the scrapping of Article 370 had not adjudicated the constitutional validity of stripping J&K of its statehood on the promise of ""their government that it would be restored soon after elections were held to the J&K assembly."" Elections were held more than a year ago and still there is no sign of restoring statehood, which is in breach of the undertaking given by Mehta to the court.He said if the bench finds it appropriate, the issue can be referred to a five-judge bench.Mehta protested loudly at the use of ""their govt"" jibe by Sankaranarayanan and said it is ""our govt"", as much mine as theirs and every Indian's. The use of ""their govt"" shows the petitioner's mindset, he said, adding that there are several considerations, including cross-border terrorism and incidents like the Pahalgam terrorist attack, which must be considered before deciding on restoration of statehood.Senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy told SC that stripping a state of its statehood has serious consequences for federalism and informed the court that the J&K cabinet passed a resolution on Oct 18 last year advising the Lt Governor to take steps for restoration of statehood.

NEW DELHI: India's all traditionally high-emission industries, including aluminum, cement and pulp & paper, will have to reduce the intensity of their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to meet specific targets by 2026-27 compared to a 2023-24 baseline as the govt has notified rules for the country's first legally binding emission reduction target for carbon-heavy industries.The rules, notified by the environment ministry on Oct 8, make it mandatory for 282 industrial units to reduce GHG emissions per unit of product (emission intensity) beginning 2025-26.These industrial units, spread across the country, will be liable to pay a penalty for non-compliance. The rules are notified under the compliance mechanism of the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), 2023.The highest number of industrial units (186) which will have to reduce GHG emission intensity (GEI) within a specified time-period belong to the cement sector, followed by pulp & paper (53), plants that use chlor-alkali process to extract certain chemicals (30), and aluminium plants (13).GEI targets (in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) for the year 2025-26 have been calculated based on the pro-rata basis for the remaining months of the current financial year. The overall reduction till 2026-27 ranges from about 3.4% in the cement sector to about 5.8% in aluminium, 7.5% in chlor-alkali and 7.1% in pulp and paper, compared to the 2023-24 levels.In case an industrial unit fails to comply with the GEI target or fails to submit the carbon credit certificates equivalent to the shortfall for compliance, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) will impose 'environmental compensation' (penalty) for the shortfall.The penalty will be equal to twice of the average price at which the carbon credit certificate is traded during the trading cycle of that compliance year. It'll be paid within the 90 days from the day of the imposition order.According to the notification, the fund collected under the 'environmental compensation' will be maintained in a separate account and utilised for the purposes of the CCTS on the recommendation of the national steering committee for the Indian carbon market.The GEI targets are in sync with India's 'net zero' emission goal of 2070 and will contribute to meet its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDCs) - climate action targets - through the reduction or removal or avoidance of GHG emissions.","India's traditionally high-emission industries, including aluminum, cement and pulp & paper, will have to reduce intensity of their greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions to meet specific targets by 2026-27.
