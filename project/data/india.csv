BENGALURU: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge 's revelation that he was ""denied"" the Karnataka chief minister's post in 1999 has reignited debate over Dalit representation in the state's politics and triggered a sharp political crossfire.Kharge said Sunday at a public event in Dharwad that he was passed over for the top post despite leading Congress Legislature Party during the 1999 assembly elections.

Kharge's comment drew immediate backlash from BJP and cautious responses from his own party.""Kharge has now demanded to be made chief minister to clear a debt owed to him,"" said BJP's R Ashoka. ""He's timed it perfectly - like hitting a ripe mango with a stone.""

New Delhi :

Neither of the three Congress MPs who were part of the multi-party delegations on the govt’s global outreach against Pakistans ponsored terrorism may speak in the Lok Sabha debate on the Pahalgam attack Operation Sindoor issue.Shashi Tharoor and Manish Tewari are not in the shortlist of speakers, while there is no clarity yet on Amar Singh. The party apparently reached out to Tharoor over the weekend but he is said to have turned down the offer to participate in the discussion. He had not expressed adesire on his own till then.Tharoor’s absence provided BJP an opening to needle Congress.BJP MP Baijayant Panda asked Congress to give a “free hand” to its MPs and claimed that Congress leadership was not allowing Tharoor to speak. But, Panda said, he was happy nobody could stop Tharoor from speaking in the country’s interest.Sources said Tharoor has expressed a wish to speak on Indian Ports Bill, with local interest being the Vizhinjam port in his constituency Thiruvananthapuram, recently inaugurated in a high-profile ceremony attended by the PM and netas across party lines.Tewari will speak on the twin legislations related to sports that are to come up soon for discussion in LS.Apparently, the Chandigarh MP had expressed desire to speak initially on the Pahalgam-Sindoor issue, but later plumped for the sports legislations.Sources said as per the inhouse system that includes “performance assessment”, an MP is named to speak on only one big issue to give chance to maximum members.The absence of Tharoor and Tewari has been noticed given they were eager participants in global outreach delegations. Tharoor’s repeated remarks in favour of govt’s claims about Operation Sindoor against Pakistan, and his contradiction of US President Trump’s “ceasefire” claims embarrassed Congress, and led to public arguments with the Congress managers.",Shashi tharoor and manish tewari are not in the shortlist of speakers.

Modi Tamil Nadu visit boosts BJP-AIADMK alliance morale,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-tamil-nadu-visit-boosts-bjp-aiadmk-alliance-morale/articleshow/122963761.cms,"Modi meeting AIADMK netas, including EPS, at Tiruchirappalli airport is seen as reaffirmation of BJP-AIADMK alliance amid recent public spats

CHENNAI/TRICHY :

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s two-day visit to Tamil Nadu has come as a morale booster not just for BJP workers but also for AIADMK rank and file.His meeting with AIADMK netas, including Edappadi K Palaniswami , at the airport is being seen as a reaffirmation of the BJPAIADMK alliance amid recent public disagreements over power-sharing. Modi’s decision to not engage with O Panneerselvam has further reassured AIADMK cadres that BJP values its partnership ahead of the 2026 polls.For BJP workers, Modi’s participation in Aadi Thiruvathirai festival, highlighting Chola glory, served as a cultural counterpoint to DMK’s Keeladi narrative, which accuses BJP of trying to whitewash Tamil Nadu’s rich past.AIADMK is upbeat, especially since not only EPS but also second-rung netas like K P Munusamy, S P Velumani, and Thalavai Sundaram were permitted to receive Modi at the airport. “By rejecting OPS’s request, Modi has sent a signal — only those parties we are comfortable with will be part of alliance,” said senior AIADMK neta S Semmalai.BJP functionaries, too, say the visit has helped build agrassroots-level bond. Some AIADMK cadres who earlier felt EPS was being arm-twisted now see the partnership as voluntary and valued.“AIADMK mobilised cadres for PM’s Trichy roadshow, showing their commitment.We’ll reciprocate in all ways possible,” said Sriram Shankar, BJP’s Trichy district chief. Netas say they are more cautious about their remarks, aware that their actions impact alliance chemistry.Likewise, AIADMK workers in Trichy say their hesitations about working with BJP have eased after the visit. Many now want more such visits to smoothen ties. “We’ll join BJP roadshows in future too,” said one functionary.To cement this rapport further, BJP state chief Nainar Nagenthran will host a feast in Tirunelveli for EPS and AIADMK netas during EPS’s statewide tour. Initially scheduled for Aug 3, the feast was postponed due to Modi’s visit but will soon take place.","Modi meeting aiadmk netas, including eps, at tiruchirappalli airport is seen as reaffirmation of bjp-aiadmk alliance amid recent public spats over power-sharing.

‘Those who are impure can't visit mosque': Muslim body writes to Delhi CM Rekha Gupta after SP Parliament meet; seeks imam's Nadvi removal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/those-who-are-impure-cant-visit-mosque-muslim-body-writes-to-delhi-cm-rekha-gupta-after-sp-parliament-meet-seeks-imams-nadvi-removal/articleshow/122945509.cms,"



NEW DELHI: The president of the All India Muslim Jamaat, Maulana Shahabuddin Razvi Barelvi, has written to Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta demanding the removal of Maulana Mohibbullah Nadvi from his position as imam of a mosque in the national capital.His demand comes days after a Samajwadi Party (SP) meeting was allegedly held inside the mosque, where Nadvi serves as imam and is also the SP Member of Parliament from Rampur, Uttar Pradesh.In his letter, Barelvi said: ""By holding a meeting of Samajwadi Party inside the mosque, the sanctity of the mosque has been violated, and the religious faith of the Muslims has been hurt.""""No other work can be done inside the mosque except offering prayers to the God,"" he added.According to Barelvi, the SP meeting was attended by party chief Akhilesh Yadav , his wife and MP Dimple Yadav, MPs Dharmendra Yadav, Ziaur Rahman Barq, and other leaders.""Impure people cannot come inside the mosque. Only those people can come to the mosque who are pure,"" he wrote.He also pointed out that two women participated in the meeting, despite entry being ""prohibited inside the mosque.""A religious place like a mosque was used for politics.Through this meeting a political message was given that the Samajwadi Party is sympathetic to Muslims,"" Barelvi added.""Therefore, I demand from you that the Imam of the mosque, Maulana Mohibbullah Nadvi, should be removed from the 'Imamat', and a person with Sufi ideology should be made the Imam who is not political,"" he concluded.Meanwhile, the BJP's minority morcha has also taken issue with Nadvi's dual role as imam and MP. Its president, Jamal Siddiqui, has written to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, seeking Nadvi’s disqualification from Parliament on the grounds that he allegedly holds an ""office of profit"" by drawing a salary from the Waqf Board.Under Article 102(1)(a) of the Constitution, Siddiqui claimed, Nadvi’s position could be considered an office of profit ""because it is financed by a statutory body under the Delhi government.""Siddiqui also wrote to Delhi CM Gupta demanding Nadvi’s immediate removal, accusing him of ""using the mosque as his personal property.""""On July 22, 2025, Mohibbullah Nadvi, along with Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, his wife, Dharmendra Yadav and other MPs, party workers, held a party meeting at the mosque where Namaz is offered and also had tea and snacks, which is against the Islamic model code of conduct,"" Siddiqui stated.He further alleged: ""Nadvi also took SP MP Dimple Yadav to the mosque, even though the entry of women is prohibited there.""""There is a place on the first floor of (the mosque) for women to sit. It is worth noting that Dimple Yadav's dress was also against the rules of the mosque,"" he claimed.""Mohibbullah Nadvi is using this mosque as his personal property and is promoting Samajwadi Party there, which cannot be done as an Imam,"" Siddiqui said.",Maulana shahabuddin razvi barelvi has written to delhi chief minister rekha gupta.

Massive Rescue Operation: Over 300 Trekkers Saved in Maharashtra's Malshej Ghat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/over-300-trekkers-rescued-in-maharashtras-malshej-ghat-kalu-river-surge-traps-group-locals-forest-teams-lead-7-hour-operation/articleshow/122935040.cms,"



PUNE: Over 300 trekkers, including 100 women, were rescued by the Thane and Junnar forest divisions with help from local villagers during a seven-hour operation on Saturday at Wagachiwadi village in the Malshej Ghat region. This area lies on the border between Pune and Thane districts, about 150 km from Pune, near the Kalyan-Ahmednagar highway.The trekkers came from Hyderabad, Pune, and Mumbai but became stranded in the forest after the Kalu River’s water level rose due to heavy rainfall in the afternoon, according to forest officials and locals. The forest officials were notified of their entrapment after receiving a call from the state disaster management cell and district administrations.The rescue operation was particularly hazardous, as locals had to swim through the rushing waters to secure ropes and harnesses to trees, using a zipline to transport individuals across the river. Bhaskar Mengal (24), a villager from Morushi village who played a crucial role in the rescue, told TOI, “The river water was gushing, and there was no other way to reach the other side. Since I am familiar with the local conditions, I swam across the river to tie ropes and a harness to the trees.The tourists were scared, and tensions were high. I had to calm them down.”“I prioritised rescuing women. Since we were using the zipline to cross the river, I had to explain the technique to them and assure them that they would not fall. We successfully sent them across one by one. Eventually, another villager, Kamlu Pokla, and forest guards joined me.” Pokla, who has successfully rescued several stranded tourists in the past, added, “During the night, the tourists began to panic and were hesitant to follow our instructions as everybody wanted to go to the other side. We had to calm them down before rescuing them from the deep forest.”Forest officials said that the tourists ventured into the restricted dense forest that Saturday morning without consulting locals. “They were unaware of the local conditions, which led to their entrapment when the river’s water level suddenly increased within a few hours. This area is extremely treacherous and risky for visitors,” Rajvardhan Bhosale, the Range Forest Officer of the Tokavade forest range in Thane district, told TOI.The rescue operation began at 3 PM and concluded by 10 PM, successfully bringing everyone to safety. Most tourists prefer to approach the Kalu River waterfall from the Murbad tehsil side because the trek to the waterfall is steep. However, this particular zone is located within a reserved forest area, home to a large population of wildlife, including leopards and venomous snakes, said the forest officials.Smita Rajhans, assistant forest officer of the Junnar forest division, said, “As many tourists share videos on social media, an increasing number of visitors from other states are coming to Junnar and the surrounding areas for trekking to enjoy the rains. They often disregard their safety, neglect to hire locals for guidance, and attempt adventurous activities in these dense forest zones, leading to their entrapment as they miss the trails. ”The Malshej Ghat, Naneghat, and several villages in the Murbad tehsil of Thane district are known for their alluring jungle treks and trails. This region receives over 200 mm of rainfall within 24 hours, causing local streams, waterfalls, and rivulets to flow at capacity. Consequently, there are numerous small and medium-sized waterfalls in the area.“The natural beauty of these water bodies attracts tourists from various parts of the country, and even international visitors have started flocking to these spots. Hence, it has become imperative for us to enhance basic safety infrastructure in these locations,” said a senior forest official.Kalu Waterfall: The famous Kalu Waterfall is situated in the Khireshwar village, Junnar tehsil, approximately 150 km from Pune. Due to unfamiliarity with the region's geography, a tourist ventured too deep into the valley near the waterfall and accidentally fell into the rushing water at its base. The Kalu Waterfall, located in the Malshej Ghat region, is renowned for its stunning natural beauty and attracts thousands of visitors, especially from Mumbai and Pune, particularly during the monsoon season. With a height of 1,200 feet, the Kalu River cascades, making it one of the largest waterfalls in the region and the district.However, locals have voiced concerns about safety at the site, noting that inadequate safety measures have resulted in numerous fatalities. The area is prone to slippery patches and unstable rocks, raising the risk of accidents.Visitors are often drawn to the site due to videos shared on social media, compelling them to capture their experiences.Past Incidents: On July 12, a group of local youths rescued a youth from Hyderabad at Kalu Waterfall. On June 6, a 23-year-old woman tragically lost her life after falling into a 150-foot-deep gorge while trekking at Rajgad Fort in the evening hours.On July 13, six trekkers lost their way while descending from Visapur Fort in Lonavala. The members of the local rescue team rescued them. They were in the forest for almost four hours. In 2022, a software engineer (33) from Hyderabad experienced a scare after losing his way during a solo trek on a 30 km treacherous route from Sonavelu village in Murbad tehsil of Thane to Konkan Kada in Junnar, passing through hilly and forest areas.","Over 300 trekkers, including 100 women, were rescued by the thane and junnar forest divisions with help from local villagers. The trekkers came from hyderabad, pune, and mumbai but became stranded in the forest after the kalu river’s water level rose due to heavy rainfall.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122935037,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-783042,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

HYDERABAD: In a twist to the surrogacy case involving a fertility clinic in Secunderabad, police have found that the baby was allegedly bought from a poor family and given to the city couple who sought IVF treatment in 2024.Police said the clinic suggested that the couple opt for surrogacy instead and assured them that the child would be biologically theirs. They were charged Rs 35 lakh for the procedure.Read also: IVF or infant trade? Dr. Patchipala Namratha linked to 2020 child trafficking case On Sunday, Hyderabad police arrested eight people including prime accused Dr Athaluri Namratha (64) of Universal Srushti Fertility Centre, Dr Nargula Sadanandam (41) an anesthetist from the state-run Gandhi Hospital and agents and technicians.They were booked on charges of cheating clients in the name of a surrogacy procedure and running a baby-selling racket. Cops also found that Srushti's licence had been cancelled in 2021. Dr Namratha was running it illegally.She has been operating three more centres in Kondapur (Hyderabad), Vijayawada, and Visakhapatnam. All of them were raided on Sunday.""The latest case appears to be only the tip of the iceberg; there could be many such cases.We are probing other couples who sought surrogacy and IVF treatment at different branches of the fertility centre to ascertain this,"" said S Rashmi Perumal, DCP (north zone).Read also: Hyderabad surrogacy clinic lost registration in 2021, but doctor continued to run it illegally Previously, Dr Namratha came under scrutiny twice – in 2016 and 2020. In the first case her licence was suspended for five years by the Telangana Medical Council after an NRI couple from the US alleged that the newborn given to them, allegedly through surrogacy, was not biologically related to them. Then in 2020 Vizag police arrested Dr Namratha and five others for allegedly trafficking newborns.Police said that more than 10 cases were previously registered against the accused doctor and her clinic at three places – Visakhapatnam, Hyderabad and Guntur.The latest incident came to light on July 26 when a city-based couple approached the Gopalapuram police alleging that the baby handed to them by the clinic – also known as Srushti Test Tube Baby Centre – following commercial surrogacy, was not biologically related to the father. They had independently run a DNA test to establish this. The couple allegedly paid Rs 35 lakh for the procedure.""After interrogating the prime accused we have established that it is not a case of surrogacy. Dr Namratha and her employees were selling infants to childless couples bought from poor pregnant women who were lured with money,"" said the DCP.She added: ""The biological parents of the baby, who have also been arrested, belong to Assam and were living in Hyderabad. They were paid Rs 90,000 and the mother was sent to Visakhapatnam for delivery.""The baby boy was two days old when he was sold to the complainant couple under the impression that it is their biological son.Among the others arrested are Dr Namratha's son P Jayanth Krishna (25), a practising advocate who used to manage his mother's funds, two employees of the clinic C Kalyani Atchayyamma (40) and G Chenna Rao (37), and an agent Dhanasri Santoshi (38). The biological parents of the infant have been identified as Mohammed Ali Adik (38) and Nasreen Begum (25). While seven of the accused have been sent to 14-day judicial remand to Chanchalguda jail, C Kalyani, an employee at Visakhapatnam branch is being brought to Hyderabad.""Apart from the illegal trade, the accused are also guilty of indulging in commercial surrogacy which is illegal in India. Only altruistic surrogacy is allowed,"" the DCP said.Senior police officials said the complainants, originally from Rajasthan, approached the fertility centre in Aug 2024 for fertility and IVF consultation. During the visit, Dr Namratha conducted fertility tests and advised the couple to opt for surrogacy. They were asked to visit the clinic's Visakhapatnam branch for further procedures.""They were assured that a surrogate would be arranged by the clinic and that their embryo would be transplanted. Over a span of nine months, the couple made multiple payments for consultation, treatment, and surrogate care,"" said a police official, adding, ""Throughout this period, the clinic provided regular updates claiming that the pregnancy was progressing smoothly.""In June 2025, the couple was informed that the surrogate mother delivered a baby boy via C-section in Visakhapatnam. They were asked to pay an additional delivery charge – of Rs 2 lakh – before taking custody of the child. The clinic claimed that the child's biological father was demanding more money.""Upon reaching Vizag, the baby was handed over along with documents falsely indicating that the child was biologically theirs, including a fabricated birth certificate,"" said the cop.When the complainants asked Dr Namratha for the DNA report they found that it was not done before the registration of the baby on their name. However, the clinic representatives kept falsely assuring the couple that the child belonged to them.Suspicion arose when the couple opted for a DNA test of all three in a forensics lab in Vasant Kunj, Delhi, which revealed that neither of them shared any genetic link with the child.""When they tried to seek clarification from the clinic, Dr Namratha initially blocked their numbers before threatening them and denying access to further documentation,"" said the police official.She said that the couple, fed up with the clinic's behaviour, approached Gopalapuram police around a week ago and lodged a complaint.""With malicious intentions, the accused Dr Namratha did not let the complainant couple meet the biological mother, who they believed was the surrogate,"" said the DCPFollowing the complaint, the police, along with health dept officials, seized the fertility centre at Gopalapuram. Officials said they found equipment which substantiated the facts that the accused were offering IVF treatments, creating live embryos, and carrying out medical procedures without any proper license.""Previously, when health officials visited the clinic for inspection on a quarterly basis, it was closed and seemed to be a residential complex. But, it turns out, patients were coming discreetly,"" said Dr J Venkati, district medical health officer (DMHO), Hyderabad.The DMHO added: ""During the recent crackdown, equipment for sex determination and nitrous oxide were also found. Many other pregnancy-related procedures such as MTP, IVF, and others were also being performed by uncertified professionals at the centre.""The DCP alleged that clients who protested were intimidated and threatened by her advocate son, who ran an office from the same premises.",Hyderabad police arrest eight people including prime accused dr athaluri namratha.

He manipulatively estranged her from daughter, says 1st wife

NEW DELHI: Can a marriage solemnised between a man and a woman belonging to the Kuki tribe in a church be dissolved by the Songpijan village committee and 'gaonburas (village elders)' in Assam's Dima Hasao district on proceedings initiated by the husband relying on customary law?The Gauhati HC had said once a marriage takes place in a church in terms with the Christian Marriage Act, 1872, it cannot be annulled by customary law practices involving village elders. Such a marriage can only be dissolved through proceedings initiated before the HC or the district judge as per section 10 of the Divorce Act, 1869, it had said.This HC ruling landed the Indian ambassador to Cuba, Thongkomang Armstrong Changsan, in a piquant matrimonial situation as he ended up with two wives. Prior to the HC declaring in 2022 that his 1994 church marriage with Neikhol Changsan subsisted, he had married another woman after the customary divorce. From both marriages, he has a daughter each.After failure of the mediation ordered by the Supreme Court, during pendency of Changsan's appeal, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi on Friday orally observed that the HC judgment is legally sound. Finding that the Indian Foreign Service officer is now married for nearly a decade and half, it decided to find a solution to this legal-matrimonial complexity and help the first wife start a new life.The ambassador said he has been paying a monthly maintenance of Rs 20,000 to Neikhol and has given her a house in Delhi.Neikhol argued the case herself and told the court that she had single handedly brought up her daughter without any participation from her husband.Neikhol, the first wife, alleged that he has now manipulatively estranged her daughter (29) from her. For the ambassador, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy said the father had been meeting the expenses of his daughter, who is pursuing a career in Bengaluru.Neikhol appealed to SC to ""protect her honour and dignity"" while describing how surreptitiously Changsan dissolved the marriage using tribal community elders, and remarried. The Justice Kant-led bench said, ""We have absolutely no sympathy for the man. The HC judgment is in your favour, and you have suffered socially and mentally. But can you think of a way to start life afresh?""Interestingly, 'Kuki Inpi' of Assam, the highest governing body of the Kuki tribe in the state, has said Kuki customary law can neither dissolve a Christian marriage performed in church nor can it force any couple to reunite against the will of the couple.SC said it could be profitable for Neikhol to meet her daughter and discuss future course of action, and asked the ambassador to arrange for her flight tickets to Bengaluru, a place of stay near her daughter's place, and pay her an ad hoc amount of Rs 3 lakh to enable her to meet her daughter.""If at all there is a possibility of settlement, the daughter could have a significant role to play,"" Justice Kant said, adding that the IFS officer must advise his daughter to re-establish contact with her mother.","Sc says it has no sympathy for cuba envoy thongkomang armstrong changsan.

NEW DELHI: A joint operation by Rajasthan and Maharashtra police, and the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has led to the busting of a drug cartel, which was using a buffalo barn in Barmer, Rajasthan, as cover to manufacture Mephedrone and Ketamine, with drugs and equipment worth Rs 50 crore being seized from the site and from Raigad in Maharashtra.The cartel was into manufacturing synthetic drugs at clandestine labs in remote areas. As much as 34 kg of Ketamine powder and 12 litres of liquid drugs were seized during the operation, officials said.The operation began with the detection of a clandestine facility at village Dholakia in Barmer district, where police found precursor chemicals and lab equipment used to manufacture the synthetic drug Mephedrone.""The facility was cleverly concealed inside a buffalo barn in a secluded area of the village. Two members of the drug syndicate were detained by the police.

The successful operation was made possible due to real-time sharing of information and coordinated efforts by Barmer police, Raigad police, and NCB zones at Jodhpur, Ahmedabad, and Mumbai.The NCB has been making intensive efforts to curb the manufacture of synthetic drugs at clandestine facilities.

Stray dogs and public safety: A humane reform rooted in progress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stray-dogs-and-public-safety-a-humane-reform-rooted-in-progress/articleshow/122955496.cms,"In Mumbai, over 4.3 lakh dogs have been sterilised. The BMC claims a reduction in stray population from 95,172 to 90,757.

In Bengaluru, a study showed a 10% reduction in stray dog population, with a 20% increase in neutering rates.

In Nagpur, nearly 40,000 dogs were sterilised in just 21 months, averaging 64 procedures per day.

Why culling is a step backward: calls for culling often arise from frustration, but evidence shows it’s counterproductive:

Removing dogs creates a vacuum effect, inviting unvaccinated, unsterilised dogs to migrate in.

Sterilised dogs guard their territory, preventing new entrants and stabilizing populations.

Rabies transmission is reduced when vaccinated dogs remain in their habitat.

Implementation gaps still exist: Despite success stories, challenges remain:

Many municipalities lack trained staff and shelter infrastructure.

Funding for ABC programs has declined since 2021.

In slum areas, sterilisation efforts are often under-addressed, skewing data and outcomes.

Global models reinforce India’s path: Countries like Thailand, Bhutan, and the Netherlands have shown that neuter-vaccinate-return strategies can eliminate rabies and reduce stray populations—without culling.

Bhutan achieved 100% street dog sterilisation and vaccination in 14 years.

The Netherlands eliminated stray dogs through government-funded CNVR programs, strict anti-abandonment laws, and adoption incentives.

A call for humane acceleration: The Supreme Court’s intervention should be a catalyst for reform, not regression. A humane roadmap includes:

Mobile sterilisation units in high-incidence zones

Mandatory dog census and vaccination audits

Public education to reduce fear and promote coexistence

Community adoption and feeding protocols

Reinstated central funding and performance-linked grants

India’s approach to managing its stray dog population is evolving. With an estimated 20 million free-roaming dogs, the challenge is real—but so is the progress. The Supreme Court’s recent suo motu cognizance of the issue, triggered by recent media reports, has reignited public discourse. But this moment need not spiral into fear-driven policy. Instead, it can be a pivot toward scaling humane, evidence-based solutions already showing results.The ABC Rules are Humane, Legal, and Working in Pockets: The Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules, 2023 mandate sterilisation, vaccination, and release of stray dogs back to their territories. This model is not just compassionate—it’s scientifically validated and increasingly effective where implemented well.These figures show that ABC works when done right—with trained personnel, infrastructure, and community support.India’s legal framework already permits euthanasia for terminally ill or dangerous dogs, but expanding this definition risks legal misuse and ethical violations.But these are fixable problems, not reasons to abandon humane policy.India’s ABC rules align with these models—it’s time to scale them, not sideline them.Reframing the Narrative: This isn’t a runaway crisis—it’s a governance challenge with proven solutions. Let’s shift the conversation from fear to fact-based optimism, and from conflict to compassionate reform.","In mumbai, over 4.3 lakh dogs have been sterilised.

Poll Should Parliament take action against judges involved in corruption? Yes, it's essential for accountability. No, judges should be protected from political influence.

NEW DELHI: Facing removal motion in Parliament for sacks of cash found at his official residence in Delhi, Justice Yashwant Varma has kept his identity a secret in his petition in the Supreme Court while seeking quashing of the in-house inquiry report and then CJI's recommendation for stripping him of judgeship.A bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Augustine George Masih is scheduled to hear his petition on Monday. In the petition, his name is described as ""XXX"". Such camouflage is used in records of SC and HCs to hide the identity of petitioner women who were sexually harassed or assaulted. It is also used to prevent revealing the identity of juveniles, and minors in matrimonial custody battles. SC has in many judgments asked all courts not to reveal the names of rape survivors in judgments.Justice Varma's plea - titled ""XXX vs Union of India"" - is the 699th civil writ petition filed in SC this year. While the Centre is the first respondent, SC itself is the second respondent. It was filed on July 17, and after the advocate on record rectified defects pointed out by the registry, SC registered the petition on July 24.Interestingly, while the petition ""XXX vs Union of India"" is listed at serial number 56 before the bench headed by Justice Datta, another petition by advocate Mathews J Nedumpara, seeking registration of FIR against Justice Varma to unravel the mystery behind the cash, its burning and subsequent disappearance, is listed at serial number 59 before the same bench on Monday.Meanwhile, Lok Sabha has admitted a notice for removal against Justice Varma signed by more than 150 MPs. The LS speaker is likely to write this week to CJI B R Gavai seeking names of an SC judge and an HC chief justice, who would be part of an inquiry committee under the Judges Inquiry Act, 1968.The speaker will nominate a distinguished jurist to complete the composition of the three-member committee headed by the SC judge. Repatriated to the Allahabad HC from the Delhi HC after the 'cash-in-kothi' controversy, Justice Varma in his petition has challenged the validity of the in-house inquiry report finding him guilty of the unaccounted cash at his residential premises and requested SC to declare the then CJI Sanjiv Khanna's May 8 recommendation to the President and the PM for his removal as unconstitutional.","Judge varma hides identity, is ‘xxx’ in his sc petition against cji b r gavai.

Poll Do you support the use of Aadhaar and voter ID cards as valid documents for voter identification? Yes No

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court once again asked the Election Commission to consider the Aadhaar card and the electoral photo identity card as admissible documents to prove the identity of voters during the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral polls, which is under way in Bihar.The Election Commission launched the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in Bihar on June 24. According to the ECI, there are 11 documents that a person needed for voter roll update and they are: Any identity card/Pension Payment Order issued to a regular employee/pensioner, any identity card/certificate/document issued in India prior to July 1, 1987, birth certificate, passport, matriculation/educational certificate, permanent residence certificate, OBC/SC/ST or any caste certificate, national register of citizens, family Register, any land/house allotment certificate by the government.The bench indicated its preliminary agreement with the Supreme Court's order, noting the Election Commission's acknowledgment in its counter affidavit regarding the acceptance of Aadhaar, voter cards and ration cards, PTI reported.The court observed that whilst ration cards might be susceptible to forgery, Aadhaar and voter cards possessed inherent authenticity and should continue to be accepted as valid documentation.A division bench comprising Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi announced that the final hearing schedule would be determined on July 29.The NGO's representative, senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, requested a temporary halt on finalising electoral rolls and publishing draft rolls.The court noted that since petitioners had not previously sought interim relief, it could not be granted now. The matter would be conclusively interpreted at the hearing.According to the EC, the SIR saw over 7.24 crore of Bihar’s 7.89 crore electors participate, a turnout rate of nearly 92%. However, multiple affidavits and field reports challenge this figure, suggesting enumeration forms were uploaded en masse by BLOs without voter consent. ADR and other petitioners claimed that even dead people were shown to have submitted forms, raising concerns of systemic fraud to meet internal targets.The EC has said that no name will be deleted without a “speaking order” and due notice.

The Madhya Pradesh high court later termed the remarks “scurrilous” and likened them to “language of the gutters”.Following the outrage, an FIR was registered against Shah under charges of promoting enmity and hatred. The Supreme Court on May 19 ordered the formation of a three-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) of IPS officers to probe the case and also stayed separate proceedings at the Madhya Pradesh High Court.Advocate Varun Thakur said the SIT had submitted a status report and the statement of the accused had been recorded. “Since he is accepting, giving public apology, then there is no need for investigation, but still we are waiting,” Thakur told PTI, noting that SIT officials had assured the investigation would be completed before August 13.

Gurgaon staring at no alerts, no enforcement in smog season

GURGAON: A large chunk of Delhi's neighbourhood has been pollution-blind since April and could remain so when toxic air over the region peaks in Oct-Nov, severely undermining mitigation strategies over India's most polluted airshed.All 29 air quality monitoring stations in Haryana operated by state pollution control board (HSPCB) have been offline since April 2 this year. The state's pollution data, meanwhile, has been coming from just two stations of the India Meteorological Department, one in Gurgaon and the other in Panchkula.HSPCB stations are offline because the board let the maintenance contract with the firm that had managed monitors for five years lapse without lining up a stopgap fix. Air monitoring stations began going offline after Oct 31 last year. By Dec 31, nearly 50% of the stations had stopped recording data, which is used by HSPCB and Central Pollution Control Board to issue daily pollution bulletins and by CAQM to formulate strategies for bad-air days.The stations progressively went on the blink till the whole network went down on April 2.On days when the IMD stations don’t record air quality because of glitches or other reasons, the state has no pollution data.This happened in Gurgaon for several days this month when the IMD station in Gwalpahari wasn’t working. A tender floated in May 2025 for an operator drew only one bidder. The bid was automatically disqualified under govt’s procurement rules that require at least two bidders for competitive selection. According to officials, the second round of tenders is still being prepared and is expected to be issued this week with a late-Aug deadline for submissions.Once bids are received, a lengthy evaluation follows. The process involves technical scrutiny, financial review, clearance by a high-powered committee and finally approval from the chief minister’s office. That, according to officials, could take 60 to 90 days. That means Haryana could enter peak smog season without real-time AQI data, without which there can be no alerts, no enforcement and no public warnings. These are all critical to Grap (graded response action plan), which usually comes into force from Oct 15.“There should have been a contingency plan. Even if you want to bring in a new vendor, you don’t shut off surveillance entirely. That’s like switching off CCTV in a high-crime zone because you are changing the camera vendor,” a senior HSPCB official admitted.Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst at Envirocatalysts, emphasised the importance of timely administrative decisions on bids for new contracts. “Decisions on opening bids for new contracts for govt services are usually planned well before the existing one ends, especially for maintaining such critical infrastructure as air quality monitoring in a state like Haryana, which lies in one of the most polluted areas. It’s unfortunate that this happened, but it should serve as a reminder to plan better for the future and for other states,” he said.Asked about it, HSPCB chairman Vineet Garg said the board has changed certain conditions in the tender and will be floating it by the end of July.While Grap’s implementation is based on Delhi’s AQI data, anti-pollution measures are enforced in all NCR cities after analysing indices recorded by local air monitors.“This blackout is likely to have serious consequences. Winter is the most polluted time of year in Haryana, with air quality often slipping into ‘very poor’ or ‘severe’ category due to stagnant weather, crop residue burning and fossil fuel emissions. Without functioning monitors, district authorities can’t track local AQI levels, identify pollution spikes, decide when to implement pollution curbs,” said Shubhansh Tiwari, research associate at Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), adding that the state would essentially be forced to rely on Delhi data.The implication goes beyond Grap. Under National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) and its state-specific pollution control action plans, govt must track, report and demonstrate year-on-year improvements in air quality, all of which are data-dependent.Manoj Kumar, an analyst at Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), said with the entire network rendered non-functional, there is growing concern about the progress, or lack thereof, made over the past six months. “In the absence of real-time data, it is tough to assess if efforts are underway to restore the monitoring system ahead of the upcoming peak pollution season. This gap in information affects both public awareness and the ability to evaluate policy response,” Kumar added.The two monitors in Gurgaon and Panchkula cover just a fraction of the state’s urban and industrial landscape. “You can’t extrapolate Delhi’s air to Karnal or Hisar,” said a senior officer who is part of the clean air programme. “The pollution sources, local weather patterns, and emissions vary. A single reading from Gurgaon tells you nothing about what’s happening in Yamunanagar or Panipat,” he said. For that matter, a station in one part of a large city won't even capture the picture in another part of it.A study of the air quality data by CREA found that Jan 19, 2025, was Gurgaon’s “overshoot day”. By then, PM 2.5 concentration was already so high that even if levels were to drastically reduce to zero for the rest of the year, the city would still fail to meet the acceptable limit specified by World Health Organisation (WHO). The analysis ranked Gurgaon as the fifth most polluted Indian city in the first half of 2025.","No pollution data from haryana as all state aqi stations offline since april.
