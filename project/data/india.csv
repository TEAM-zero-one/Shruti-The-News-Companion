Casteist violence

bail clause not right to favourable outcome: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has said it is mandatory to grant a hearing to the victim while deciding bail to an accused under SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, failing which the bail would be deemed legally unsustainable.Interpreting Section 15A(5) of the SC/ST (POA) Act, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan said the provision makes it compulsory that the victim or their counsel must be afforded a meaningful opportunity of being heard while considering a bail application and bail can be cancelled on the ground of violation of this section.The bench clarified that the provision guarantees an opportunity to be heard, not a right to a favourable outcome or to a detailed adjudication of every objection raised by the victim. ""Once the victim has been notified, permitted to participate, and allowed to place objections on record, the statutory mandate stands satisfied,"" it said.""It is beyond cavil that section 15A(5) incorporates the principle of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) for victims under the SC/ST (POA) Act. Where such a right is conferred, the court must provide the victim or their dependent an opportunity of audience, either personally or through counsel, including the special public prosecutor.The statutory right to be heard presupposes that the victim is made aware of the proceedings and is not excluded therefrom,"" the bench said.Referring to earlier verdicts of SC, the bench said, ""The court approved the view taken by Gujarat HC in Hemal Ashwin Jain case which categorically held that failure to provide the victim an opportunity of being heard in bail proceedings constitutes a failure of justice, rendering the order legally unsustainable. This court concluded that the victim or dependent is an active stakeholder in proceedings under the SC/ ST (POA) Act and that compliance with Sections 15A(3) and 15A(5) is mandatory"".The court passed the order on a plea seeking cancellation of bail of an accused. Though the bench said that there was no violation of Section 15A(5) as the victim was given hearing, it, however, quashed the bail order of Madras HC on the ground that the criminal antecedent of the accused was not considered by HC.The top court said the high court order suffers from fatal infirmities as it ignored that the bail for the accused in another case was cancelled after the death of a material witness when he was out on bail. The criminal antecedents of the accused were expressly placed before HC and were recorded in the impugned judgment but HC failed to draw any conclusion from them, it said.",Supreme court said it is mandatory to grant a hearing to the victim while deciding bail to an accused under sc/st (prevention of atrocities) act. Justices b v nagarathna and r mahadevan said the provision makes it compulsory that the victim or their counsel must be afforded a meaningful opportunity of being heard.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126261732,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1478930,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

'Called Minor Matter, Refused FIR': Tripura Student Angel Chakma's Father Blasts Uttarakhand Police

DEHRADUN: The family of Anjel Chakma, the young Tripura native killed in Dehradun earlier this month, pushed back sharply against the city police chief's public dismissal of racial slurs as a motive behind the murder - a claim central to the family's version of events and backed, they say, by the firsthand account of Anjel's brother, Michael, who witnessed the attack.Momen Chakma, Anjel's uncle and among the first relatives to arrive in the city after the assault, said the police were choosing to ignore the words of the only eyewitness. ""Michael is not just a family member, he's the complainant in the case. He was there when it happened. The incident lasted minutes - how do you expect anyone to stop and film something like that?"" he told TOI Tuesday. ""Instead of listening to the person who saw it unfold, they are issuing public statements without even completing the investigation. ""Faced with mounting questions, Dehradun SSP Ajai Singh clarified Tuesday that Michael's complaint only mentioned ""casteist slurs"". He said, ""The family stayed in Dehradun until Dec 27 but did not mention racial slurs to the police...If they want to share additional information, we are open to including it in the probe.""If the family of Tripura native Anjel Chakma is saying this (racial slurs motive behind the murder) now, we are not aware of it.However, the case is still under investigation,"" Dehradun SSP Ajai Singh said. Police were gathering all possible evidence to build a strong case before filing the chargesheet, he added. Dehradun police, citing ethnic background of some of the accused, had said they found no indication of racial provocation in the case. The family, still grieving, called this ""premature and deeply dismissive"".Anjel, 24, and his younger brother Michael, were in Dehradun when they were allegedly attacked by a group of six men after objecting to their disruptive behaviour. According to Michael and other family members, the attackers shouted racial slurs - words like ""chinki"", ""Chinese"", and ""momo"" - before turning violent. Michael sustained injuries, and Anjel later died of his wounds. ""It's not just about one word or one insult,"" Momen said. ""It's about whether our voices are even considered valid when we speak.""SSP Singh had on Monday pointed out that two of the six accused were from Manipur and Nepal, which, he said, made a racial motive unlikely. That reasoning has since triggered public criticism, particularly from members of North-East civil society and activists familiar with the region's complex ethnic and linguistic diversity.","Anjel chakma, 24, and his younger brother michael, were in dehradun when they were allegedly attacked by a group of six men after objecting to their disruptive behaviour.

Chicken’s Neck Threat Sparks Sharp Reply As Nagaland Minister Warns Bangladesh Radicals Boldly

GUWAHATI: Assam police busted a module of Imam Mahmuder Kafila (IMK) with the arrest of 11 alleged operatives of the Bangladesh-based Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) offshoot formed in 2018. Investigators said IMK expanded its base in the state after Bangladesh's Aug 2024 regime change that led to the exit of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.Of the 11 people held by Assam police's Special Task Force (STF), 10 were picked up from Assam and one from Tripura in operations since late Monday night. CM Himanta Biswa Sarma acknowledged the threat from such modules. ""Fundamentalists are definitely active in Assam. The issue will remain for long as Bangladesh is Assam's neighbouring country,"" Sarma said.STF chief and Guwahati police commissioner Partha Sarathi Mahanta said IMK used encrypted social media groups to radicalise and recruit youths in Assam and nearby states, spread propaganda, raise funds through hawala and UPI channels, and facilitate cross-border travel for training.""Probe revealed that following the regime change in Bangladesh in Aug 2024, top leaders of JMB, Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT) and al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) issued directions to IMK leadership to activate and expand its Indian modules.Bangladeshi nationals Umar and Khalid were assigned to coordinate Assam-based activities. The head of the Assam cell is one Nasim Uddin alias Tamim of Barpeta Road in Barpeta district in Assam,"" Mahanta said.Nasim Uddin was among those 11 arrested. Multiple charges under BNS, 2023 and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967 were slapped on the suspects.Mahanta said IMK, banned in India, was formed by Jewel Mahmud alias Imam Mahmud Habibullah alias Sohail, described as a former JMB member who claims to be the amir (leader) of IMK and propagates the ideology of ""Ghazwatul Hind (Battle against India)"".Mahanta said IMK propagated an ideology aligned with proscribed transnational jihadi organisations and operated through secure social media platforms. ""One such social media group is 'Purva Akash', which functions as a principal communication and recruitment platform. People from Assam, Bengal and Tripura were being radicalised, recruited, financially mobilised. IMK disseminates extremist propaganda advocating violent jihad and the armed conquest of India. ""Investigators found that some Assam-based IMK operatives had travelled to Bangladesh earlier this year on valid passports and visas for training and coordination, Mahanta further said.",Assam police arrest 11 alleged operatives of the bangladesh-based jamaat-ul-mujahideen bangladesh (jmb) offshoot formed in 2018.

Message to Congress leadership or attacking coterie? Why Digvijaya Singh’s 'power of organisation' post is intriguing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/message-to-congress-leadership-or-attacking-coterie-why-digvijaya-singhs-power-of-organisation-post-is-intriguing/articleshow/126253556.cms,"Shashi Tharoor Responds To Digvijaya Singh, Says Congress Needs Discipline, Not Lessons From RSS

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh is no stranger to controversies. The former Madhya Pradesh chief minister, who is known to speak out his mind, has triggered several political storms with his remarks. The veteran Congress leader, who has been one of the strongest critics of the BJP and the RSS , has often been accused of insulting the Hindu community to appease the minorities. In fact, such has been some of his remarks in the past that even the Congress was forced to distance itself from them. It is in this context that his latest social media post citing RSS and BJP to highlight the “power of organisation” seems intriguing.The Congress Rajya Sabha member on Saturday shared a 1996 photo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with L K Advani and praised the BJP and the RSS for promoting ground workers – alluding to PM Modi – to posts like chief minister and Prime Minister. ""I found this picture on the Quora site. It is very impactful. In the way the grassroots swayamsevaks (workers) of RSS and the workers of Jan Sangh @BJP4India sit on the floor at the feet of leaders and become the Chief Minister of the state and the Prime Minister of the country. This is the power of the organization. Jai Siya Ram,"" Singh said on X.As expected, the post created a flutter. The fact that it coincided with the Congress Working Committee meeting and was tagged not just to the party's top leadership but also to Prime Minister Modi added to the intrigue.Also, the use of ""Jai Siya Ram"" at the end seemed strange for a leader, who was once in the centre of a storm for using “Osamaji” for Osama bin Laden. Under all round fire then, Digvijaya had clarified that it was a slip of tongue.So, what was the objective of Digvijaya’s post? Was he actually trying to please the BJP and the RSS? Or was he dropping hints about his future plans and sending a message to the top leadership? Or was he targeting leaders within the Congress who are close to the top leadership?While nothing is impossible in politics, it is difficult to believe that Digvijaya would have had a sudden change of heart vis-a-vis the RSS and BJP and would try to please them.So, was the Congress veteran sending across a message to the top leadership? Well, Digvijaya’s Rajya Sabha term ends in July 2026 and the big question is will the Congress nominate him again? If not, how would he react? After all, we have seen another party veteran Ghulam Nabi Azad turn from a loyalist to a rebel and quit the party in 2021 after he was denied a Rajya Sabha ticket. Will Digvijaya follow suit if ignored? Well, we do not know for now.So, that brings us to the third possible reason for Digvijaya’s post. Was the senior Congress leader targeting the top office-bearers in his party responsible for running the organisation and who are very close to the leadership? The fact that many leaders came out in his support on the need to strengthen the organization gives some credence to this possibility.Most Congress leaders, as expected, unleashed a broadside against Digvijaya’s post and rejected the idea of learning anything from the RSS. Congress leader Pawan Khera said, ""There's nothing to learn from the RSS. What can an organisation known for Godse teach an organisation founded by Gandhi?""Congress MP Manickam Tagore asserted that the Congress had nothing to learn from what he described as a hate-driven organisation. “The RSS is an organisation of hatred. It spreads hatred, breeds hatred and carries out propaganda based on hate. There is nothing to learn from the RSS,” he said.However, many others defended Digvijaya and argued that the focus should not be on the example he had cited but on his message for strength and unity in an organization. They cited his commitment to the Congress and also his strong anti-RSS stand in the past.""Look, it is important to pay attention to whose words are being used, what they mean, and in what context they are spoken. No one can even remotely think that whatever Digvijaya Singh says would not be in the interest of the Congress party or that he would speak in a way that goes against the party's ideology. He is a pillar of the Congress party, and if he has used any particular language, it is necessary to understand what his context was and what his target was what he was trying to do,"" Salman Khurshid told ANI.Congress leader TS Singh Deo defended Digvijaya Singh's remarks and said: ""Digvijaya Singh is much senior to me; I cannot comment on his statement. He will be able to explain it better, but as far as strengthening the organisation is concerned, it is a continuous process...In any organisation, whether it is the BJP, RSS, or any other, everyone's work is reviewed. The BJP certainly reviews the Congress and other parties. .. So, Digvijaya Singh's intention was not to imitate anyone, but he spoke about what we can do to strengthen the organisation.""Congress MP Imran Masood said Digvijaya Singh has consistently opposed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). ""Digvijay Singh is a staunch opponent of the RSS. That's all I know; there's no need to create so much controversy over this,"" he said. Congress leader Rajeev Shukla also defended the former MP CM and said that the matter was being ""unnecessarily amplified"".Party leader Udit Raj openly backed Digvijaya’s message and admitted that the grand old party was grappling with serious organisational weaknesses and widespread factionalism. ""There is definitely organisational weakness. Is there any doubt about that? For 10 years, we couldn't even appoint district presidents. Whenever someone was appointed, another group would block it. Factionalism is rampant,"" Udit Raj told news agency IANS. ""Discussion is part of Congress tradition; we don't run a dictatorship like the BJP. It is in our tradition to introspect. If there were no organisational weaknesses, would we keep losing elections repeatedly? The positive thing is that we are working to overcome our shortcomings. There is nothing wrong with it,"" he added.Candid confession that to some extent justifies Digvijaya’s strong post.However, with his remarks putting the Congress on the backfoot, Digvijaya first issued clarification and then sent out a unity message slamming the BJP. ""I am a supporter of the organisation, but an opponent of the RSS and Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi. I have only praised the organisational strength of the RSS. I have always opposed the policies of the BJP and the RSS,"" he said as his post raised a storm. Later, he targeted the BJP and said ""There is no difference in ideology. We (Congress) are all united, and this Nehru-Gandhi family is a family in which two people have been martyred. I strongly condemn the BJP's attempts to sow discord within this family."" "" Rahul Gandhi has started this initiative (strengthening the organisation) from the district level and below. The process for that is underway. It will be completed soon,"" the Rajya Sabha member added.While this clarification helps the Congress counter the BJP attacks, it does little to solve the mystery behind his cryptic message: Was Digvijaya dropping hints about his future plans or was he targeting Congress leadership and the coterie in the party?","Senior congress leader digvijaya singh is no stranger to controversies. His latest social media post citing rss and bjp to highlight the ""power of organisation"" seems intriguing. Was he actually trying to please the bjp and the rss?

PM Modi Pens Powerful Letter On Duties And Democracy, Reflects On His Constitutional Journey

SRINAGAR: For decades, scholars had tried to translate the Constitution of India into Kashmiri. That wait has now ended. The translation is now available on the Union law ministry’s website.President Droupadi Murmu released the volume in a red-bound edition decorated with Chinar leaves and traditional Kashmiri decorative art. Prof. Aejaz Mohammad Sheikh of University of Kashmir, who led a 11-member translation panel that worked on the project for over two years, described the work as a “watershed moment” for Kashmiri language.“You now have the Bible of law in Kashmiri. This is not just a transfer of knowledge. It enriches the language itself. It gives Kashmiri the legal and intellectual vocabulary needed to translate science, law and modern knowledge,” Sheikh said.Many experts believe that while Kashmiri language possesses a rich body of translated works, including classics from world literature, the translation of a foundational legal document like the Constitution marks a historic first.“A common Kashmiri can now read the Constitution in their own language.When students see that Kashmiri language can carry the language of law, not just poetry, it changes how they see their mother tongue. It proves that Kashmiri language has the grammar, lexicon and strength to express the most complex ideas. This translation has the ability to move Kashmiri language out of a confined literary circle, allowing it to reach the common masses,” said Sheikh, who is dean of School of Arts, Languages and Literature at the university.A govt official echoed the view. “By incorporating constitutional, legal and administrative terminology, the translation strengthens Kashmiri’s capacity to function as a language of governance and law.” Linguistic experts believe the text should be introduced in schools and made available through voice-based software so it can reach the wider public.Basher Bashir, another member of the translation panel, said the exactness and authenticity had been maintained in the legal text of the Constitution.The project began in Aug 2023 when National Translation Mission (NTM) of Central Institute of Indian Languages, Mysuru, approached Sheikh. Fluent in Kashmiri, Urdu and Hindi, and proficient in Sanskrit, the professor agreed to do it. He put together a multidisciplinary team of linguists, academics and legal experts from his university, Satish Vimal of All India Radio (Srinagar), and education department officials.Team members first worked individually, then met to compare and refine their drafts. This was followed by a series of intensive seven-day workshops. The first was held in Mysuru, where legal experts read the Constitution in English while linguists compared it with their Kashmiri translation.. Every term was debated, every phrase tested. Where differences arose, they were discussed until a consensus was reached before moving forward.After the fifth workshop, Sheikh carried out a final, detailed review and submitted the draft. The manuscript was placed online for public feedback for three months by the Union law ministry before the President formally released the final version on Nov 27. The translation uses the standard Kashmiri Perso-Arabic script, adopting a simpler, more accessible style.On Sept 2, 2020, the Union Cabinet had approved Jammu and Kashmir Languages Bill, 2020, recognising five official languages in the UT -- Urdu, Hindi, Kashmiri, Dogri and English. Before the revocation of Article 370, Urdu was the sole official language of the erstwhile J&K state.",President droupadi murmu released the volume in a red-bound edition decorated with chinar leaves and traditional kashmiri decorative art.

The order came after CBI dropped attempt-to-murder charge against the accused.The case stems from a CBI FIR registered on July 26 this year on directions of the Supreme Court, which took cognizance of allegations that constable Khursheed Ahmed Chowhan was unlawfully held at the joint interrogation centre in Kupwara from Feb 20 to Feb 26 and subjected to severe abuse “on the pretext of investigating narcotics-related offences”.Chowhan’s wife Rubeena Akhter had moved the top court after J&K high court declined to order registration of a case. Her petition alleged her husband was beaten with iron rods and wooden sticks, given electric shocks and left critically wounded, with claims of mutilation, grievous harm to private parts, insertion of iron rods and chili powder allegedly forced into his rectum.Acting on the Supreme Court’s July 21 order, CBI filed a chargesheet on Oct 22 this year.On Tuesday, the principal district and sessions judge of Kupwara directed the superintendent of Humhama subsidiary jail in Srinagar to release the accused after they furnish bail and surety bonds of Rs 1 lakh each.Advocate Ahrar Dar, appearing for the accused, said the home department had not granted mandatory sanction to prosecute at the time of filing the chargesheet. He said a “crucial and material change of circumstance” occurred after investigators dropped the most serious counts — IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 326 (grievous hurt by dangerous weapons).“The legal impediment of section 307, which was the cornerstone of the previous bail rejection, no longer exists,” Dar said, adding that the case now rests on less severe charges within the court’s bail jurisdiction. He said CBI opposed bail but the court granted relief after hearing arguments.","A court in north kashmir’s kupwara granted tuesday bail to eight policemen, including a dsp.

4 Chennai teens detained for migrant labour attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/4-chennai-teens-detained-for-migrant-labour-attack/articleshow/126241719.cms,"Chennai, Sep 1 (IANS ) The Chennai City Police have issued orders prohibiting the flying of drones in the city ahead of President Droupadi Murmu’s two-day visit to Tamil Nadu, citing security reasons.

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu police have detained four 17-year-old school dropouts for hacking a 20-year-old migrant worker from Odisha with sickles near abandoned railway quarters in Tiruttani, a temple town on Chennai's northwestern fringe, after filming the assault to post as a social media reel.The victim, K Suraj, recently arrived in Chennai following a family dispute and had been surviving on menial jobs, police said Monday.The attack unfolded Saturday evening aboard a Chennai-Tiruttani EMU local train. At Thiruvalangadu station, about 70km northwest of Chennai, the four juveniles boarded Suraj's compartment, allegedly drunk & carrying two sickles concealed in bags. Investigators said they planned to use the weapons while recording content for social media.A brief exchange in Hindi escalated into an argument that continued until the train reached Tiruttani station, around 90km from Chennai. After disembarking, the youths allegedly forced Suraj towards the railway quarters near the tracks. Three attacked him with sickles, with one flashing a ""victory sign"", while a fourth recorded the assault on a mobile phone, police said.Suraj suffered deep cut wounds. Bleeding heavily, he staggered to a nearby road, where passers-by alerted railway police. He was taken to Tiruttani govt hospital and later referred to Tiruvallur Govt Medical College Hospital, where doctors said his condition was stable. Police traced the suspects using the video uploaded to Instagram, locating them later that night near Gangai Amman temple along the Tiruttani-Arakkonam bypass, a highway stretch on the town's outskirts, where they were allegedly drinking.Produced before the Juvenile Justice Board, three were sent to a govt observation home. The fourth, described as differently abled, was released to his parents with a warning.","Four 17-year-old school dropouts detained for hacking migrant worker with sickles.

'Called Chinki, Chinese, Momo': Tripura Student’s Killing In Dehradun Triggers Protests Across State

'Tragic that patriotic people of northeast are referred to as Chinese and attacked'

DEHRADUN: A 24-year-old MBA student from Tripura, who confronted a group of men hurling racial slurs at him and his younger brother, died in a Dehradun hospital on Friday after fighting for his life for over 14 days. The stabbing happened on Dec 9, minutes after Anjel Chakma said, ""We are not Chinese... We are Indians. What certificate should we show to prove that?"" The six men allegedly responded with brutal violence.What began as a regular grocery run to the local market in the Selaqui area of Uttarakhand's capital city turned into a fatal confrontation that evening.Anjel and his brother Michael, both students in Dehradun for over a year, were stopped and taunted by a group of men who allegedly referred to them in derogatory terms. When Anjel calmly stood his ground, the situation turned uglier.Michael would later tell police and friends how his brother calmly but firmly corrected them. That assertion, of identity and dignity, was met with knives. ""Soon after Anjel replied, they attacked him and his brother while hurling abuses,"" said a friend of Anjel's, who remained at the hospital through the two weeks that followed. ""Anjel suffered serious injuries to his neck and spine.Michael is also injured and still in a serious condition. ""The friend requested anonymity, but his voice carried anger and disbelief. ""He was one of the calmest, friendliest people. We're all broken by what happened."" Anjel's body was flown to Agartala on Saturday, as Tripura erupted in anger. His family was assisted by Pradyot Bikram Manikya Debbarma, chairman of Tipra Motha Party and a member of the erstwhile Tripura royal family, who had been in touch with the family since the day of the incident and had supported his medical treatment.Speaking to TOI, Debbarma said on Saturday, ""It's tragic that the patriotic people of the northeast are called Chinese and attacked. Those who hurl racist slurs forget that it is because of the brave people of the northeast that China cannot enter the country. These incidents don't just hurt families. They divide our people. And when we are divided, we are vulnerable. We don't want that. We want justice.""Suraj Debbarma, state president of Youth Tipra Federation, the youth wing of Tipra Motha, who helped coordinate Anjel's last rites, said: ""People from the northeast face racial slurs and xenophobic attacks in the north regularly. But when students from north Indian states come to central institutions in the northeast, they are welcomed like fellow countrymen. We lost an innocent soul in a hate crime. That's the tragedy. ""Police said the case was registered on Dec 12 on a complaint filed by Michael Chakma, 21. Five of the six accused - including two juveniles - were apprehended on Dec 14.Senior sub-inspector Jitendra Kumar of Selaqui police station said on Sunday, ""Yagya Awasthi, the main accused, is suspected to have fled to Nepal... Two police teams have been dispatched to track him down and nab him, and a reward of Rs 25,000 has been announced. After Anjel's death, we added additional BNS sections - 103(1) (murder) and 3(5) (committing crime with common intention).""Initially, the FIR was filed under BNS sections 115(2) (voluntarily causing hurt), 118 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons), and 351(3) (criminal intimidation). On Dec 14, based on doctors' statements, sections 109 (attempt to murder) and 61 (criminal conspiracy) were added.The charges were upgraded again after Anjel's death. Friends recalled how Anjel, in his final days, struggled but never regained full consciousness. Protests have begun in colleges in the northeast, demanding a national law against racial hate crimes.

Unnao Rape Case: Activists Protest Outside Delhi High Court Over Sengar Bail

Aishwarya Sengar's big charge after SC order in Unnao case

NEW DELHI: Ishita Sengar, daughter of former BJP MLA and Unnao rape case convict Kuldeep Singh Sengar, penned an open letter on Monday saying that she is “exhausted, frightened and slowly losing faith”.Her statement came after the Supreme Court stayed a Delhi high court order that had suspended her father’s life sentence.In her letter, Ishita wrote: “I am writing this letter as a daughter who is exhausted, frightened, and slowly losing faith, but still holding on to hope because there is nowhere else left to go.”The Supreme Court stayed the operation of the December 23 Delhi high court order and directed that Kuldeep Singh Sengar shall not be released from prison in connection with the 2017 Unnao rape case.A three-judge vacation bench comprising Chief Justice of India Surya Kant and Justices JK Maheshwari and AG Masih passed the order while hearing a plea filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The bench observed that although courts usually do not stay bail orders once a convict is released, the present case involved “peculiar facts” as Sengar remains in jail in another criminal case.“We are conscious of the fact that when a convict or an undertrial has been released, such orders are not ordinarily stayed by this court.But in view of the peculiar facts where the convict is convicted for a separate offence, we stay the operation of the Delhi High Court order,” the bench said.Also read: 'Will ensure Kuldeep Sengar is given death sentence- Unnao rape survivor hails SC decision; what she said Kuldeep Singh Sengar, an expelled BJP MLA from Unnao, was sentenced to life imprisonment in December 2019 for the rape of a minor under the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. He is also serving a separate 10-year sentence in a CBI case related to the custodial death of the rape survivor’s father.In her letter addressed to the “Hon’ble Authorities of the Republic of India,” Ishita Sengar said her family had waited silently for eight years, trusting the legal system.Explaining why the family chose not to protest publicly, she wrote: “We chose silence not because we were powerful, but because we believed in institutions. We waited because we believed that truth does not need spectacle.”She alleged that despite being labelled “powerful” because of her father’s political identity, her family remained unheard.“People call us ‘powerful.’ I ask you what kind of power leaves a family voiceless for eight years?” she said. Ishita added that her family had been “drained financially, emotionally, and physically” while seeking justice.Also read: SC stays Delhi HC order granting bail to Kuldeep Sengar; ex-BJP MLA to remain in jail Ishita also claimed she had received rape and death threats on social media over the years, which eventually silenced her.“Over these years, I have been told countless times that I should be raped, killed, or punished simply for existing,” she wrote, describing the abuse as “daily” and “relentless.”She further expressed concern that fear and public outrage were beginning to overshadow facts and due process.“If pressure and public frenzy begin to overshadow evidence and due process, what protection does an ordinary citizen truly have?” she asked.Clarifying her intent, Ishita said the letter was not written to seek sympathy or special treatment.“We are not asking for a favour. We are asking for justice because we are human,” she wrote, urging that the law be allowed to function “without fear” and evidence be examined “without pressure.”During the Supreme Court hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, described the case as a “very horrific” instance of child rape and argued that Sengar, being an MLA at the time, occupied a dominant position over the victim, attracting stricter punishment under the POCSO Act.The bench also expressed concern that excluding lawmakers from the definition of “public servant” under POCSO could create legal immunity for MPs and MLAs.Meanwhile, the rape survivor’s mother welcomed the Supreme Court’s order, saying it gave her hope that her daughter would finally get justice.The Supreme Court has issued notice to Sengar and sought his response within four weeks. The matter is scheduled to be heard again in the last week of January.Following the apex court’s decision, Kuldeep's daughter Aishwarya Sengar alleged that her family was not given an opportunity to present its arguments on the merits of the case and claimed that key facts were being overlooked.“We couldn’t even start arguing on the merits of the case today, that she has changed her statement several times, changed the timing thrice, starting from 2 pm, 6 pm and then finally 8 pm. There’s a finding of the AIIMS medical board that she was more than 18. I’ve been fighting for justice for the past eight years, but maybe the sorrows of me and my family mean nothing. We have been stripped of our dignity, our peace, and even our fundamental right to be heard. Still hope for justice. I request that the media not spread any misinformation,” Aishwarya said.","Ishita sengar, daughter of former bjp mla and unnao rape case convict, penned an open letter on monday.

BJP-Led Mahayuti Sweeps Maharashtra Local Body Polls; PM Modi, CM Fadnavis Hail Victory

NEW DELHI: Union minister Ramdas Athawale on Tuesday termed his party RPI(A)’s exclusion from Mahayuti seat-sharing seat-sharing for BMC polls as ""betrayal of trust"". He said that his party would contest on 38 seats, however, adding that he would ""support the BJP and Shiv Sena on other seats. """"Since the formation of the Mahayuti, we have stood by the alliance with complete sincerity and firmness. However, what has happened today regarding seat-sharing is nothing but a betrayal of trust,"" he said in a post on X.Taking a stand for the ""dignity"" of party workers, Athawale released the candidate list and said that it is ""absolutely essential for the Ambedkarite community's power to participate in governance.""""The BJP offered a proposal for just 7 seats late at night, but putting up candidates in new locations at the eleventh hour is now impossible. Even though our strength in Mumbai is greater than that of the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), we were sidelined in the seat allocation, which has caused intense resentment among RPI workers across Maharashtra. We are not like other leaders who repeatedly twist words or change their stance as it suits them.Fundamentally, we cannot accept any compromise that forgets the party, the workers, and their self-respect, because the workers' strength is the party's true strength,"" he said.""Therefore, we will not take any stance that puts the workers' dignity and the party's existence at stake. Our word and our loyalty are rock-solid. From a broader perspective, it is absolutely essential for the Ambedkarite community's power to participate in governance and, through that, to keep the work for the common people going unceasingly. It is with this seriousness in mind that we have decided to stay with the MahaYuti. Many more decisions can be taken after the election results, but it is now clear that we will contest 'friendly fights' on 38 to 39 seats. Even though our support for the MahaYuti remains firm, on these seats the RPI will demonstrate its strength,"" he added.BJP MLC Pravin Darekar met Athawale and later, speaking to the reporters, he said that ""his participation in the government and his respect will be ensured in a dignified manner.""""Ramdas Athawale is not upset; he is with the Mahayuti alliance. But he has his own party, so there is pressure from his party workers. Every party's workers feel they should contest the elections... There are 227 seats and thousands of workers who are interested in contesting elections... I believe that after discussing this with the chief minister, his participation in the government and his respect will be ensured in a dignified manner,"" he said.Even as the BJP and Shiv Sena have declared a seat-sharing arrangement, another Mahayuti ally—the NCP led by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar—is fighting the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation elections on its own.Meanwhile, the last date for filing nomination papers for the January 15 elections to 29 municipal corporations across Maharashtra ends on Tuesday.","Ramdas athawale's party rpi(a) excluded from mahayuti seat-sharing seat- sharing for bmc polls.

'Want approachable people's courts'

Justice Surya Kant, Known For Article 370 Ruling And Pegasus Scrutiny, Takes Oath As India’s New CJI

Now, lawyers can't argue for days in high-stake cases

NEW DELHI: If a citizen faces a legal emergency or is threatened with arrest by probe agencies at unearthly hours, the person will be able to seek a hearing from constitutional courts even in the dead of night for protection of fundamental rights and liberties, the Chief Justice of India said.""My endeavour is and will be to make the Supreme Court and high courts people's courts which can be approached at any time beyond working hours in legal emergencies,"" CJI Surya Kant told TOI.The CJI said one of his priorities is to set up as many constitution benches as possible to deal with pending petitions raising several important constitutional issues - like the one thrown up by a bunch of petitions challenging validity of special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, which started from Bihar and is now being carried out in a dozen states. The bench on SIR would take up the issues after conclusion of the countrywide updation of electoral rolls.CJI Kant said he would also examine the feasibility of setting up a nine-judge bench to decide many petitions that articulate the clash between religious freedom and women's rights. The issue arises in three categories of cases, including petitions seeking review of the SC order allowing women of all ages into Sabarimala temple.By custom, women of menstruating age were barred from going inside Sabarimala shrine. Another set of pleas challenge the practice of female genital mutilation among Dawoodi Bohra Muslim community and the ban on entry of women into mosques, and, the third set question denial of entry into Agiary (Zoroastrian temple) of Parsi women who marry outside the community.In another significant development, it would no longer be permissible for renowned lawyers to argue for days together in high-stake matters. CJI Surya Kant has decided to enforce strict timelines for advocates to complete arguments.""The constitutional courts will function like hospitals with emergency wards. In case of a legal emergency, a citizen, irrespective of status, can knock on the doors of Supreme Court even at midnight to seek redress of an urgent grievance and seek protection of individual rights and liberty,"" CJI Kant said.There will never be another case like the one arising from settlement dispute between Ambani brothers in which lawyers argued for 26 days in SC. ""This is to ensure that poor litigants not only get free legal assistance but also an equal share of court time during hearing of their cases,"" the CJI said.Apart from mandatory submission of written submissions not exceeding five pages at least three days prior to the hearing, SC has issued a circular saying, ""Senior advocates, arguing counsel and/or advocate-on-record, shall submit the timelines for making oral arguments in all post-notice and regular hearing matters, at least a day prior to the commencement of the hearing of the case.""To speed up hearing in pending cases, the CJI said, ""Various special categories have been identified for priority listing to send a message that Supreme Court is a people's court.""","Cji surya kant has decided to enforce strict timelines for advocates to complete arguments.

'Wanted to show how one can have fun without booze'

For years, New Year's Eve came with a familiar script: you drink, you party, you recover (or regret it) later. But a growing number of Indians are now opting for a 'sober' start to 2026. ""There was a time I drank to drown my sorrows,"" says 45-year-old Mumbai-based entrepreneur Madhu Gupta. This New Year's Eve, though, her plans look very different: an early dinner at a hotel, followed by a 'Stranger Things' marathon with her teenage daughter. Alcohol doesn't figure anywhere. Even her 30-year-old niece in Bengaluru is skipping the usual party scene.Gupta and her niece are part of a growing global sober curious movement - people who are reshaping their relationship with alcohol. For some, it means giving it up entirely and for others, it might mean a shift to low-alcohol options. Health reasons and the desire to have more meaningful interactions/experiences without being wasted are driving the shift.For this crowd, the perfect Dec 31 is about music, community, and being home before the streets get wild. That's the spirit behind the Motta Maadi Music Sober Party, started by Chennai-based musician Badhri Narayanan Seshadri as a mischievous jab at New Year's excesses.Seshadri is quick to clarify that it wasn't planned as an anti-alcohol event. ""The entire team is largely teetotallers, so this is how we celebrate. Otherwise, where do teetotallers go on Dec 31? Watch television?"" he laughs. This year, their Dec 31 show will be held at Sir Mutha Venkatasubba Rao Concert Hall, with two performances at 3pm and 7pm, both featuring Tamil film music. The evening ends not with a countdown. ""We finish with 'Ilamai Idho Idho', a popular New Year song by Ilaiyaraaja,"" says Seshadri.The shift is also showing up in how venues are programming the night. In Hyderabad, rooftop cafe Ce La Vie is advertising a 'sober and sensational' New Year's party complete with a DJ, a midnight countdown and an elaborate mocktail menu. In Indore, Kaner Baag is hosting a sober New Year's Eve built around a familiar party template - a DJ night, live dhol, unlimited buffet, zero-proof cocktails and a midnight countdown with fireworks - just without the booze. The event is aimed at ""families, couples and groups looking for a safe, elegant, and premium alternative to crowded club parties"".For 21-year-old Raj Dashore, a partner at Kaner Baag and one of the organisers, the idea is a pushback against how celebrations in the city have changed over generations. ""In our parents' generation, drinking became the centre of every celebration in Indore. Every month, there's a new pub launching,"" he says. ""At Kaner Baag, we wanted to show that you can be surrounded by nature, have fun and feel calm without alcohol. ""Dry doesn't mean dull. Across the country, mixologists are leaning into technique-driven creations - think beetroot negronis and kiwi collins - designed to deliver flavour, not buzz.Hyderabad-based Meera Girija Tadimeti, an architect-turned-chef who specialises in homestyle Telugu food, says this New Year's Eve she will simply sip sparkling water or soda. ""There is more research now that shows no amount of alcohol is safe, so I made a conscious decision to say no to alcohol,"" says Tadimeti, who was a social drinker earlier. ""I don't succumb to social pressure and respect my body's limitations,"" she adds.Others are stepping away from the pressure to ""do something big"" altogether. Instead of hosting traditional New Year's Eve events, Kolkata's The Barge Company is planning a 'River Reset' weekend on Jan 3, 4 and 11 aboard its heritage vessels, Riviera and the restored Bengal Paddle. ""The first weekend of Jan should be a sober weekend. We wanted to do that by channelling the tranquillity of the river with activities like sound bath, yoga flow and iceberg mind mastery on the cruise,"" say Rishika Das Roy, marketing director at The Barge Company. ""As for drinks, we will have tea-tasting and mushroom coffee,"" she says.",A growing number of indians are opting for a'sober' start to 2026.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah predicted Tuesday a BJP govt in Bengal with a two-thirds majority in the 2026 assembly polls, while promising to end infiltration and seeking to calm fears among the Matua community over EC's special intensive revision of electoral rolls and the Citizenship Amendment Act.""BJP has resolved that when it forms govt after April 2026, it will restore Bengal's lost glory,"" Shah said during a 40-minute interaction with reporters. ""Development has come to a halt. Fear and corruption have become the identity of the state... We will uproot Trinamool Congress .""Shah traced BJP's rise in Bengal from two Lok Sabha seats and 17% vote share a decade ago to 18 seats in 2019 and 77 assembly seats in 2021, asserting Congress and CPM had been reduced to zero. ""We had 36% vote share in 2021 and we will win 2026 with a two-thirds majority,"" he said, adding the election would be fought on ""stopping infiltration and driving infiltrators out"".Addressing Matua concerns, Shah said he spoke Monday with Bongaon MP and junior Union minister Shantanu Thakur, assuring that no Matua would lose voting rights or citizenship. ""Matuas have no reason to be afraid. Refugees who came to Bengal are citizens of India and nobody can harm them - not even Mamata Banerjee,"" he said.BJP functionaries said that of nearly 1.5 crore Matuas in Bengal, about 70,000 have applied for citizenship under CAA.Shah accused the TMC-led govt of blocking border fencing by not allotting land to BSF. ""I have sent seven letters... there was no response,"" he said. ""Infiltration is happening on Mamata Banerjee's watch. Forged documents are being prepared. Demography is changing to strengthen her vote bank.""Shah also targeted TMC over alleged corruption, naming Partha Chatterjee, Jyotipriya Mallick and Anubrata Mandal, and referring to allegations against Firhad Hakim and Sovan Chattopadhyay. ""Yet Didi says there is no corruption,"" Shah said.He claimed women's safety was at risk and people were told not to step out after 7pm.
