Monks and nuns may have renounced all trappings of worldly life — and many of them do not vote — but they, too, are being called for SIR (Special Intensive Revision) hearings, mainly for listing their spiritual gurus’ names under the ‘name of parent’ column in the electoral records.Taking cognisance of the inconvenience faced by monastic orders, the Election Commission (EC) has directed district election officers (DEOs) to conduct hearings at ashrams and religious institutions, instead of asking monks to travel to designated centres. In cases where supporting documents are unavailable, the DEO — who is the district magistrate — has been authorised to act as a quasi-judicial authority and clear voter applications.The issue surfaced after several monks received hearing notices due to address and identity mismatch, caused by years of transfers between ashrams. Eighty-two-year-old Swami Muktikamananda, adhyaksha of the century-old Gadadhar Ashram (Ramakrishna Math) in Bhowanipur, south Kolkata, said his voter ID card and Aadhaar were linked to a Ramakrishna Math in Bankura (more than 200km from Kolkata), where he had stayed for an extended period.“I was initially asked to attend a hearing in Bankura, but after intervention by electoral officials, I submitted my enumeration form in Bhowanipur itself,” he said.Last Wednesday, around 90 monks attended a special SIR camp organised at Belur Math, with hearings held at the Abhedananda Convention Centre. Participants included residents of the Belur headquarters as well as monks from centres such as the Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama in Narendrapur. While monks of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission do not vote, they seek inclusion in electoral rolls to avoid complications in visa applications and administrative work.Monks from Bharat Sevashram Sangha (BSS) and Iskcon, many of whom do vote, have also received SIR notices. Swami Mahadevananda of BSS said several monks had listed founder Acharya Swami Pranavananda’s name as their parent, triggering document mismatches. General secretary Dilip Maharaj said monks without passports attended a special hearing on Jan 20 at the Ballygunge headquarters.Iskcon spokesperson Radharamn Das said monks who had earlier voted in Kolkata had been asked to submit fresh documents from their native places across India and abroad.Voters in Jhargram and West Midnapore — in Bengal’s Jangalmahal, about 150km from Kolkata — have, over the years, learnt how to coexist with elephants. It’s a sort of mutual respect, born out of a certain wariness — and a tacit understanding: “Stay out of my hair, and I’ll stay out of yours.”During the SIR, regular elephant movement has coincided with a sudden rise in human movement — residents with voter detail anomalies are having to travel far and wide to arrive at hearing centres, a highly unsafe exercise. And, so, the poll body said yes when the two district administrations wanted to set up multiple hearing centres, located near human settlements, across six assembly constituencies.Similar arrangements are also being planned in elephant-heavy pockets of North Bengal.In West Midnapore, voters from select Jangalmahal villages will attend hearings at the Pirakata Community Hall, under the jurisdiction of Salboni police station. Salboni BDO Ruman Mondal said residents of villages such as Kalsibhanga, Satpati, Kalaimuri, Garmal, Lalgaria and Bhimpur were directed to appear at the new centre from Jan 15.Medinipur Sadar subdivisional officer Madhumita Mukherjee said it was a deliberate decision to choose the additional centres based on how close they were to villages, so that hearings could be conducted based on real-time elephant movement.“Ten additional centres have been set up in the district, including a consolidated venue catering to villages from two assembly constituencies in elephant corridors,” said Bijin Krishna, the DM of West Midnapore. In Jhargram, special hearing centres have been established at 10 high schools across the Nayagram, Gopiballavpur, Jhargram and Binpur constituencies. The DM, Akanksha Bhaskar, said the measures were taken in the interest of public safety.In the North Bengal districts of Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar, Alipurduar, North Dinajpur and South Dinajpur, employment records issued by tea gardens and cinchona plantations are valid proofs of identity and residence for workers and their families.Labourers in tea and cinchona estates — many of whom have lived in makeshift quarters for generations — have struggled to produce conventional documents, such as land records or formal proof of address.As a result, during SIR hearings, they have been unable to come up with those documents, leading to fears of disenfranchisement. Plantation employment records are routinely maintained by garden authorities, and now that they have been recognised by the commission as a bona fide voter eligibility document, it’s come as immense relief for workers.Netas across the political spectrum welcomed the move, but while BJP MP Jayanta Roy called it an “excellent step”, TMC’s Rajya Sabha MP, Prakash Chik Baraik, said the move ought to have been taken long ago, and that the delay had caused unnecessary panic.Members of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) have welcomed EC’s decision to conduct doorstep verification, amid concerns over document availability and identity mismatch.In Totopara, home to the Toto community (the state’s smallest PVTG) in North Bengal’s Alipurduar, residents said the move has eased anxieties over land and identity records. “Many families do not have land khatiyans, while migrant workers lack links to ancestral property. We were worried, but the EC has taken extra care,” said Bakul Toto, secretary of the Toto Kalyan Samiti.Similar issues have surfaced among the Birhor and Lodha Shabar communities. Around 300 Birhors live in south Bengal’s Purulia district — across Balarampur, Baghmundi and Jhalda-I blocks, with 181 adults listed in the 2024 Lok Sabha electoral rolls. In forest-dependent areas, many Birhor families now reside in permanent houses provided by the state, but discrepancies in records have triggered SIR hearings.Lodha Shabar members — spread across West Midnapore and Jhargram — are also receiving notices. The community comprises over 1 lakh people across nearly 17,000 families. District administrations had flagged concerns over whether members possessed sufficient documentation, following which the EC, on Dec 31 last year, instructed DEOs to conduct physical verification.In West Midnapore, Lodha Shabar residents have been attending hearings at block development offices. In the Keshiary block, multiple villagers were summoned despite having submitted details during the enumeration. “We produced voter ID, Aadhaar and family details at the hearing,” said Basanti Dandapat of Lengamara village.West Bengal Lodha Shabar Development Board chairman Balai Naik said teams were visiting villages to reassure residents. “There is no need to panic. In cases of spelling errors or linkage issues, officials will verify details on the ground,” he said.Similar “special public hearings” have been ordered for sex workers as well, as many of them lack identity proof.Officials said district election officers have been instructed to hear such cases separately and adopt a facilitative approach, recognising that many sex workers have been disconnected from their families for decades or do not know their parents’ names.For 55-year-old Baby Khatun, who has lived in Sonagachi, Kolkata’s largest red light district, since she arrived there at the age of 10, the hearing notice triggered panic. “I only remember that my family lived in Kidderpore. I don’t know my parents’ names,” she said. With no immediate relatives, she listed her landlord as her guardian.“How can I produce a family tree? I don’t even know their names. I’m afraid my name will be deleted,” she said.Rekha Das, another sex worker, has a voter and Aadhaar cards but faced difficulty enrolling her son, a first-time voter, because the form requires the name of a blood relative from the mother’s side. “I have documents, but no family records,” she said.EC officials said the concerns were genuine and assured no eligible voter would be struck off the rolls solely for lack of documents, stressing that SIR was aimed at inclusion, not exclusion.","Monks and nuns may have renounced all trappings of worldly life.

Need to strengthen development trajectory in Manipur: PM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/need-to-strengthen-development-trajectory-in-manipur-pm/articleshow/127063004.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi Wednesday emphasised the need to continue working with renewed vigour in order to strengthen development trajectory in ethnic strife-hit Manipur, conveying to the state administration the Centre’s “full and steadfast” support.On the statehood day of Manipur, Tripura and Meghalaya, he wrote separate letters to their respective heads of govt, highlighting Centre’s efforts to speed up progress in the region where development had “stagnated”.In his letter to Manipur governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla, Modi recalled his visit to the state in Sept last year. “I reaffirmed our unwavering commitment to stand with the people of Manipur and to support every effort aimed at ensuring lasting peace and sustained progress,” he said.The visit was seen as part of Centre’s multi-pronged push to defuse ethnic tensions involving Meiteis and Kukis and restore normalcy in the state.He told Bhalla, “I salute my sisters and brothers of Manipur for their remarkable courage and unwavering faith in peace and progress. It is imperative that we continue to work with renewed vigour to strengthen Manipur’s development trajectory. I assure you of the Centre’s full and steadfast support in this endeavour.”“Since 2014, our govt has worked with the resolve of ‘Act East, Act Fast’ to empower the region, unlock opportunities for progress and fulfil the aspirations of the people,” he said.Writing to Tripura CM Manik Saha, Modi said it was an undeniable reality that the people of the Northeast, including Tripura, had for decades felt distant and isolated from national mainstream.The PM said that govt’s vision of ‘Purvodaya’ is transforming the Northeast.While Tripura once faced insurgency and unrest, the 2024 peace accord with NLFT and ATTF has ushered in a new dawn of hope, he said.The Prime Minister told Meghalaya CM Conrad Sangma that development in the Northeast had stagnated before NDA govt got a historic mandate in 2014 and began working extensively to transform the region.","Pm narendra modi wrote separate letters to heads of manipur, tripura and meghalaya.

JAMMU: Operation Trashi-I entered its fourth day on Wednesday, as security forces continued to comb the dense forests of Sonnar, Mandral-Singhpora, and adjoining areas in Chatroo belt in J&K’s Kishtwar district to track and kill fleeing terrorists. Searches were intensified in the target area, even as additional forces were rushed to the operation site to fortify the cordon and block possible escape routes, officials said.Meanwhile, amid enhanced vigil ahead of Republic Day, local police, SOG, and CRPF jointly conducted door-to-door searches in localities with a high concentration of Burmese (Rohingyas) and Bangladesh nationals in Bhatindi-Narwal-Rajiv Nagar areas on the outskirts of Jammu on Wednesday. Similar checks were also carried out in Rajouri, Poonch, Samba, Kathua, Udhampur and Doda districts as a precautionary measure, officials said, adding that none was detained.Operation Trashi-I was launched late Sunday based on intelligence inputs about the presence of terrorists in Chatroo.

IIT Kanpur

campus saw 30% of suicides over 2 yrs, fix accountability at top level: Alumnus

MUMBAI: The death of a student by suicide at IIT-Kanpur on Tuesday again swivelled the spotlight on a mental health crisis on the campuses of India's premier technical institutions: over a dozen young lives lost every year on average over the past five years.At least 65 students have taken their own lives across the Indian Institutes of Technology between Jan 2021 and Dec 2025, show figures kept by the Global IIT Alumni Support Group. As many as 30 suicides were recorded in the past two years (see box), raising concerns about institutional responsibility, and accountability. The deaths have occurred across undergraduate, PG and doctoral programmes, often followed by official statements attributing them to ""personal"" or ""academic"" stress.Student bodies and alumni said such explanations flatten a more complex reality: one shaped by 'relentless evaluation', competitiveness, isolation and, in some cases, caste or language-based exclusion. Faculty members privately admit that warning signs are often missed, and interventions tend to arrive when distress has already reached a critical stage.The numbers at IITs sit within a far larger national tragedy.India recorded more than 13,000 student suicides in 2023, according to NCRB data, which translates into roughly 36 incidents every day.Supreme Court has formed a task force to address mental health concerns and prevent student suicides. Dheeraj Singh, an IIT Kanpur alumnus (2004 batch) and founder of the Global IIT Alumni Support Group, called for direct accountability at the highest level. “The hon’ble Supreme Court has reaffirmed that mental health is an integral part of the Right to Life under Article 21,” he said.“Further, in the Saha vs State of Andhra Pradesh case, the court has ordered that student mental health be treated as a constitutional and institutional responsibility,” Singh added.Singh wants accountability and hopes it will drive a change in mindset towards mental health.“Given that this is the ninth suicide death on IIT Kanpur campus (in 2 years), education ministry is urged to hold the director accountable for the serious state of mental health and consider bringing in a new head to improve the situation,” Singh said.The IIT Kanpur alumnus argued that figures show 30% of the suicide deaths over the last two years have been at IIT Kanpur, which is the highest toll in any of the 23 IITs in the country. IIT Kharagpur was a close second, recording seven suicides during this period.IIT Bombay, Singh pointed out, had only one suicide during this period though it has a higher number of students enrolled than Kanpur.","At least 65 students have taken their own lives across the indian institutes of technology between jan 2021 and dec 2025. As many as 30 suicides were recorded in the past two years, raising concerns about institutional responsibility, and accountability.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127054689,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-277559,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
5 traffic offences in a year could bar you from driving,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-traffic-offences-in-a-year-could-bar-you-from-driving/articleshow/127055072.cms,"Traffic offences will not be carried over beyond one year

NEW DELHI: Five or more traffic offences in a year and you could be barred from driving for 3 months. This provision - disqualification or revocation of driving licence (DL) - has been added by the road transport ministry through a fresh amendment to the Motor Vehicles Rules to rein in habitual errant drivers, reports .The licensing authority - RTO or district transport office - has the power to decide on suspension of DL. The rules also state that licensing authority must give the licence holder an opportunity of being heard. The notification published Wednesday said the condition of five or more offences in a year for disqualification of DL commences from Jan 1.The new notification said that ""no offence or contravention recorded in any previous one-year period shall be taken into account for determining offences or contravention in any subsequent one-year period"".Till now, there were 24 provisions in the rules that could trigger the licencing authority concerned to initiate disqualification of DL. These included theft of vehicle, assault on passenger(s), abduction of passenger(s), driving beyond permitted speed limit, overloading and abandoning vehicle in a public space.These provisions have been made considering that these ""constitute nuisance or danger to public"".Now, going by the new provision of five or more traffic offences, such as not wearing helmet, seat belt and jumping red signal, can result in suspension of DLs.The new provision drew mixed reaction from experts in road traffic laws.Former Delhi deputy transport commissioner Anil Chhikara said that while disqualification after five offences is a step in the right direction, but ""the conflict is that people driving dangerously are not caught by traffic police"". He added that in absence of a standard operating procedure (SOP), traffic offences recorded using CCTV cameras are often challenged in courts.Rohit Baluja, who teaches police, transport and judicial officers on laws related to motor vehicles, termed the amendment ""draconian and conceptually flawed"".The ministry's notification also specified the procedures for issuing, managing and paying traffic challans, or fines. It said that any police officer in uniform or any other officer authorised by state govt will issue a challan and there can be auto-generation of e-challans. The violator can pay the challan or contest it within 45 days. Failure to contest within 45 days will be treated as deemed acceptance by the offender.",The provision - disqualification or revocation of driving licence (dl) - has been added by the road transport ministry.

'To Remove Corrupt DMK': TTV Dhinakaran Meets Goyal As AMMK Rejoins NDA Ahead Of Tamil Nadu Polls

From Tamil Nadu to Kerala

NEW DELHI: Karnataka governor Thaawarchand Gehlot has become the latest to decline the customary address to the legislature on Thursday, amid a series of recent controversies surrounding governors’ addresses to legislative assemblies.Following the development, the Karnataka government said a high-level delegation led by the law minister would meet the governor at Raj Bhavan at 5.45 pm on Wednesday. The reasons for Gehlot’s refusal are not yet clear.The joint session of the Karnataka legislature, scheduled from January 22 to 31, was to begin with the governor’s address. The session was expected to be tense, with sharp exchanges likely between the ruling Congress and the BJP–JD(S) opposition on several issues.One major point of confrontation is the centre’s decision to replace the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) with the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act, or VB-G RAM G Act.The situation in Karnataka follows a tense episode in the Kerala assembly a day earlier. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan objected to governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar’s address, saying parts of the cabinet-approved speech were skipped and certain additions were made.According to Vijayan, the omitted sections criticised the Union government’s fiscal policies and referred to bills passed by the Kerala assembly that are pending with the Lok Bhavan. The speaker ruled that only the cabinet-approved text would be treated as the official record.A similar confrontation was also seen in Tamil Nadu, where governor R N Ravi declined to read the state government’s address and walked out of the assembly, citing objections during the proceedings.Inside the House, the situation led to a sharp exchange, with assembly speaker M Appavu urging the governor to follow established rules and customs of the assembly.",Karnataka governor thaawarchand gehlot declines customary address to legislature.

Omar invokes Jinnah’s two-nation theory to taunt calls for separate Jammu state,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/omar-invokes-jinnahs-two-nation-theory-to-taunt-calls-for-separate-jammu-state/articleshow/127038477.cms,"SRINAGAR: Breaking his silence on demands for separation of Jammu and Kashmir, chief minister Omar Abdullah on Wednesday accused BJP MLAs of echoing Pakistan founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s two-nation theory.“Why are BJP legislators demanding a separate Jammu state? They do not have the interests of the people of Jammu in mind,” Omar said while addressing National Conference workers in Jammu.The CM mounted a sharp attack on leader of opposition Sunil Sharma, accusing him of pursuing his personal ambition to become chief minister. “…For that, he is using some people in Jammu and a few yes-men in Kashmir. They are promoting Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s two-nation theory that Hindus and Muslims cannot live together,” Omar said, adding: “Be straightforward. Why don’t you say ‘separate Hindu Jammu’?”Taking further potshots at the BJP leader, he said Sharma’s demand would limit him to being the CM of “two-and-half districts”, suggesting that the Muslim majority areas of Jammu — the Pir Panjal region comprising Rajouri and Poonch districts, and the Chenab Valley comprising Doda, Kishtwar and Ramban districts — would not support Jammu’s separation from Kashmir. “If you want to divide Jammu and Kashmir on the basis of religion, you will end up being chief minister of Kanak Mandi and Raghunath Bazaar,” Omar taunted, referring to two markets in Jammu city.He also targeted Mehbooba Mufti-led PDP, calling it an “old ally” of BJP. “They have now started talking about separate divisions for Rajouri-Poonch and the Chenab Valley. But remember, as long as the National Conference’s flag is flying in J&K, this conspiracy will not succeed,” the CM said.Mehbooba had on Monday demanded carving out separate divisions from Jammu to make governance accessible in hilly regions.Reacting to Omar’s jibes, Sharma said neither he nor BJP had made any official statement on further bifurcation of J&K. He also rejected claims that he desired to become CM, saying he came from a poor family and his only aim was to work for humanity and the nation. “In contrast, it is people in the Abdullah family who desire to be chief minister as they want to have protocol in place even when skiing, so that no one else should be around when he plays,” he retorted.A debate over the issue started earlier this month after BJP legislator Sham Lal Sharma pitched for a separate Jammu state, alleging discrimination against the region by “Kashmir-based rulers”. Several BJP legislators, including Vikram Randhawa, have since accused the CM of imposing “Kashmiri sentiment” on Jammu. Randhawa said Ladakhis sought separate UT because of Kashmiri dominance, and the same reason had spurred the calls for a separate Jammu state.","Omar abdullah accuses bjp mlas of echoing pakistan founder muhammad ali jinnah’s two-nation theory. “why are bjp legislators demanding a separate jammu state?

Are those from Delhi or Gujarat not our brothers? Thousands come here, and they are welcome. In the same spirit, the people of Jammu will remain our brothers tomorrow as well. God willing, even after separation, brotherhood will remain,” he said.On Farooq’s statement that a division would be against secular ethos, Lone said: “India has a population of 1.5 billion. We are barely six or seven million. Aren’t we speaking far beyond our weight? Did we ever sign a contract to safeguard secularism?” Kashmiri leaders routinely claimed the moral high ground of secularism, while students from the Valley continued to be beaten, humiliated and targeted across the country, he alleged.Kashmiris had never consented to bear this disproportionate burden of unity, he asserted. Lone said while Kashmiri Muslims remained on the frontline in the fight against terrorism, with nearly 90% of police martyrs being from the community, a “relentless campaign of hatred”, he alleged, was emanating from Jammu.As a debate rages on over the issue, with Jammu repeatedly alleging discrimination by Kashmir-centric govt, the People’s Conference chief had recently reacted strongly after BJP and a section of the high court bar association raised a demand that the National Law University proposed in Budgam be shifted to Jammu. “Maybe, the time has come for an amicable divorce.

Ladakh was represented by the LAB and the KDA, which are amalgam of political and religious groups from the Leh and Kargil regions, respectively.The first round of the talks took place after the Centre’s ordered an inquiry into the Sept 24 police firing on protesters in Leh who were demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for the region. Four protesters were killed in the firing. After the commission of inquiry was set up, the LAB and the KDA agreed to begin talks with the Centre, leading to the Oct 22 meeting.Later, on Nov 14, the LAB and the KDA submitted a 29-page joint draft proposal to the home ministry seeking statehood and Sixth Schedule.

Illicit mining has to be stopped at all costs,"" said a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant, and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi.On Dec 29, the bench took suo motu cognisance of environmentalists' concerns over its Nov 20 order accepting the 100-metre-elevation definition of Aravali hills and ranges, and stopped all mining, including renewal and grant of new leases, across the Aravalis in four states. It also put on hold its earlier order allowing preparation of a management plan for sustainable mining.The SC will also constitute an expert body for Aravalis, which will function under the apex court.The bench asked amicus curiae K Parameshwar, additional solicitors general Aishwarya Bhati and K M Nataraj, and senior advocates, including Kapil Sibal, to suggest names of experts — environmentalists, geologists, naturalists and forest experts – within four weeks.These names will help the court form an expert body to carry out an “exhaustive, holistic and scientific” examination of the Aravali Hills and Ranges for a comprehensive definition to protect its “structural and ecological” integrity. “The expert body will work under the direct supervision and control of the Supreme Court,” the CJI-led bench said in its order.Till the expert body is formed, a comprehensive study is conducted and recommendations submitted to the court, the states shall “take all possible steps to stop illegal mining activities and prosecute the offenders,” the court said. Refusing to entertain multiple intervention applications, the bench said it would not allow certain vested interests to derail the attempts to preserve and protect Aravali ranges, which is the last defence against Thar desert extending its debilitating influence on the fertile Gangetic plain. Issues that had pricked the court’s mind and led to reopening of the issue are – whether the 500-metre separation between two Aravali Hills created a structural paradox for the Range; whether it broadened the non-Aravali areas within the Range to allow unregulated mining activities; and, the sanctity of the 100-metre-elevation definition. Another issue flagged by court was: “Whether the widely publicised criticism asserting only 1,048 hills out of 12,081 in Rajasthan meet the 100-metre-elevation threshold, thereby stripping the remaining lower ranges of environmental protection, is factually and scientifically accurate?”","The supreme court on wednesday said illegal mining continues in the aravali hills and ranges.

On Oct 8 last year, SC stalled the project on a petition jointly filed by five retired Indian Forest Service (IFS) officers and NGO ‘People for Aravalis’ , who through advocate Shibani Ghosh had alleged that the project would spell doom for the already damaged crucial Aravali range.Amicus curiae and senior advocate K Parameshwar flagged three issues — impact of the project on water table of the area, species and afforestation, and sourcing of animals. “All these three issues raise sufficient doubt that the project should not be implemented,” he said.The bench said since no work has commenced yet on the ground, it would be ideal that the entire project and its feasibility, both from environmental and ecological aspects, is examined threadbare by the CEC and report be given to the court.“If the CEC opines that the project is ecologically and environmentally harmful, then that is the end of it,” the court said, adding that the interim stay on the project would continue till further orders.The petitioners had said, “The proposed zoo safari entails large-scale construction of permanent structures and facilities, including administrative blocks, research and laboratory centres, guest houses, staff quarters, animal enclosures, hotels, restaurants, recreational and commercial establishments, as well as extensive infrastructure facilities such as roads, electrical and communication networks, and firefighting systems. ”“Large-scale development of this scale within the Aravali region would inevitably result in severe and irreversible ecological damage to an already fragile ecosystem, which is home to rich floral and faunal diversity,” they said, and alleged that the zoo-safari project is being funded with the compensatory afforestation funds, which is impermissible.The petitioners said a project primarily aimed at revenue generation through large-scale commercial and recreational activities in this eco-sensitive region is bound to undermine the ecology and hydrology of the Aravali region.","Haryana’s senior additional advocate general lokesh sinhal told a bench of cji surya kant and justices joymalya bagchi and vipul m pancholi that the state wanted to commence work only on 3,500 acres.
