DGCA Plans New Rules For Power Banks On Flights After Fire Scare On IndiGo Plane

NEW DELHI: Getting into the Yuletide spirit could prove expensive for an Air India pilot who was to operate a Vancouver-Delhi (via Vienna) flight on Dec 23, 2025. A staffer at Vancouver duty free either saw him inadvertently sipping wine being offered at this festive time or found him smelling of liquor while he was buying a bottle. She reported this Boeing 777 pilot to the Canadian authorities who conducted a breath analyser test on him which he flunked and then he was detained.Luckily for passengers, Air India managed to quickly find a replacement. The ultra long haul, to be operated by four pilots or two sets (one captain and a co-pilot in each set) in turns, supposed to leave at 3 pm local time did so with just a two-hour delay. The aircraft then landed in Vienna from where another set of crew operated it to Delhi.“AI has taken a very stern view of this matter. The pilot was flown to Delhi a couple of days later and is being probed. The issue has been reported to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), which is also examining the same,” said people in the know.While some sources say the pilot had inadvertently sipped an alcoholic drink at the airport and a staffer at duty free saw him doing so, others said he smelled of alcohol when buying a bottle.It is not yet known which of the two really happened, staffer reported the matter to Canadian authorities who then used CCTV footage to find out the pilot in question was to operate with flight. They managed to trace him to the AI aircraft.In a statement, AI said: “AI 186 from Vancouver to Delhi on Dec 23, 2025, experienced a last-minute delay after one of the cockpit crew members was offloaded prior to departure. Canadian authorities raised concerns regarding the pilot’s fitness for duty, following which the crew member was taken for further inquiry. In accordance with safety protocols, an alternate pilot was rostered to operate the flight, resulting in the delay. ”""Air India regrets the inconvenience caused to its passengers and is fully cooperating with the local authorities. The pilot has been taken off flying duties during the process of enquiry. Air India maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any violation of applicable rules and regulations. Pending the outcome of the investigation, any confirmed violation will attract strict disciplinary action in line with company policy. Safety remains Air India’s highest priority at all times,” the airline statement added.Pilots operating international sectors usually do not have pre-flight breath analyser (BA) tests and the same is conducted on arrival as liquor is available on board these flights. This is to ensure they have not taken a sip or two during the flight. On domestic flights, pre-flights BA tests are conducted as alcohol is not served/sold on flights within India.While rules don’t mandate this, AI on its own has enforced a policy of conducting random pre-flight BA at international stations. The airline frequently keeps sending its doctors on international flights who then conduct these checks on pilots who are to operate the return flight to India.Pilots are surprised at this case. ""Forget drinking, we don’t even use after shaves, perfumes, mouth wash or homeopathic medicines some hours before operating a flight. There have been multiple instances of teetotallers failing BA tests because of the alcohol in their breath because of using toiletries with alcoholic content. We look for these items without any alcohol, except homeopathic medicines where possibly there’s no option,” said a captain. The reason: Failing BA test thrice means losing flying license.",A staffer at vancouver duty free either saw him inadvertently sipping wine being offered at this festive time or found him smelling of liquor while he was buying a bottle. She reported this boeing 777 pilot to the canadian authorities who conducted a breath analyser test on him which he flunked and then he was detained.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126281235,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-360839,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Where Tigers Get Caught Between Faith And Tourism | I Witness

Testing human tolerance

In early 2025, a motion-sensor camera high on the hills of Purulia district, West Bengal, blinked to life. The image it captured was unremarkable in isolation: the grainy silhouette of a tiger crossing scrubland. But for residents and forest officials, it was extraordinary. Purulia had never yielded a tiger sighting before. No camera traps, no spoor, no local memory of the big cat. The photograph was more than a record; it was a signal - that the landscape had begun to shift in ways people were only beginning to comprehend.Within weeks, researchers traced the animal's path through a series of camera traps: March 2024 in Chhattisgarh's Balrampur forest division; summer sightings in Jharkhand's Palamau Tiger Reserve; and by January 2025, in Bengal's Purulia and Jhargram. The tiger had wandered roughly 500 km through human-dominated terrain, crossing administrative and ecological boundaries in search of space.The tiger's journey is not an anomaly. It is part of a pattern. India's wild tiger population, once on the brink of collapse, has surged from 1,411 in 2006 to approximately 3,682 in the latest estimate - almost 75% of the world's wild tiger population. This rebound, often hailed as a conservation landmark, is the centrepiece of Project Tiger's story.Conservationists and forest staff took pride in the numbers, even as they now grapple with the consequences of unprecedented success.Scientists at the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) estimate that nearly 30% of these 3,682 tigers - more than 1,100 animals - now roam outside notified tiger reserves, sharpening the challenge of coexistence. WII director GS Bhardwaj told TOI that a dedicated Tiger Outside Tiger Reserves (TOTR) project has already been initiated from 2025, with the focus on conserving both tigers and people. The project targets forest divisions that host dispersing tigers, aims to mitigate human-tiger conflict linked to TOTR, and envisages strengthening protection regimes beyond reserve boundaries.But there is a paradox embedded in that success: Project Tiger became ""a little too successful"", as an expert said. As core reserves fill, tigers disperse farther - into buffers, across states and into human landscapes, fuelled by instinct, not intention. Tigers are inherently territorial; adults typically range across tens to hundreds of square km depending on prey and habitat. Studies in Indian landscapes have shown female home ranges between 30 and 64 sq km, with males sometimes exceeding 170 sq km. The average, even in prey-rich forests, often approaches 90 sq km.Bhardwaj said WII has advised all states to strengthen wildlife protection outside tiger reserves and carry out intensive monitoring of tigers moving beyond them, so that encounters do not escalate into human casualties or retaliatory killings.In the central Indian landscape - the broad swath of forests, hills and plateaus that includes Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and surrounding states - pressure is particularly acute. Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, for instance, has one of the highest tiger densities in the country. A state-level review found territorial fights to be a major cause of death among tigers there between 2021 and 2023, reflecting intense competition for space and mates. With older males holding core territories, younger animals are pushed into buffer zones and near villages, raising the frequency of conflict. Bandhavgarh registers more than 2,000 cattle kills annually - a stark indicator of how tigers are pressed against the edges of ecological and social boundaries.Not all reserves exhibit the same degree of crowding though. In Uttarakhand, Corbett and Rajaji tiger reserves are approaching saturation, but nearly half of India's reserves remain below what scientists describe as their ecological capacity. Forest officials in the state have reported that Corbett can support about 20 tigers per 100 sq km, while eastern Rajaji's capacity is around 14 per 100 sq km - figures that help explain why animals increasingly stray outside protected areas.As tigers move beyond core forests, their presence ripples through local communities in palpable ways. In early 2025, in several villages in Uttar Pradesh's Pilibhit region, a prowling tiger caused schools to be closed. Children stayed home. ""Exams are coming,"" said a Class 5 student from Khalispur had then said, ""but we haven't even completed the syllabus."" Teachers refused to hold evening sessions. Parents stopped letting children walk alone. Tigers in Pilibhit often establish temporary bases in sugarcane fields, drawn by wild boars that feed on the sweet crop. Boars attract tigers. Sugarcane draws both. And between them lies the village.Elsewhere, the consequences have turned fatal. In Gadchiroli district of eastern Maharashtra, tiger numbers grew from zero to nearly 30 in five years - a startling shift in a landscape long considered tiger-scarce. With 12,000 sq km of forest, it appears generous on paper. But in practice, only about 7,000 sq km in two forest divisions is occupied. Human settlements, encroachments, and patchy prey base have constrained the actual carrying capacity. In 2024, 25 villagers died in tiger attacks across the Wadsa and Gadchiroli divisions. Two problem tigers were captured. A tigress was spared because she had cubs. Though technically capable of holding far more - by some estimates, up to 300 tigers - Gadchiroli cannot even accommodate 25 without triggering conflict.In one forest-fringe home in Jharkhand, a tiger entered a family's hut, settled on a wooden cot, and waited. The family, stunned, watched in silence from a corner of the room. The tiger had wandered far from mapped territory. Its entry was a mistake. Its departure, hours later, was quiet. Nobody was hurt. The event became a story of awe and fear.These tigers are no longer sentinels of wilderness. They are migrants. Monarchs in exile. Each one a ghost of ecological success, walking into fields, hamlets and homes - not out of aggression, but because the forests behind them are full.In some landscapes, officials speak of ""social carrying capacity"" - not how many tigers the habitat can sustain, but how many human communities are willing to tolerate. In parts of Uttarakhand, tiger-inflicted fatalities have surpassed leopard attacks for the first time in years. In response, village volunteers called Bagh Mitras have been trained to monitor tiger movement and alert forest departments. Some report sightings through mobile apps. Others simply listen for silence - the kind that descends before a tiger appears.Translocation - moving tigers from dense parks to underpopulated reserves - has been tried. Odisha attempted it in 2018, without success. Intra-state efforts show more promise, but officials now lean toward corridor consolidation. Movement is safer when it's natural. But for that, corridors must exist - not just on policy maps, but on the ground.In the Terai Arc, at least 10 critical corridors are under threat from habitat loss and development. In central India, linear infrastructure - railways, highways, power lines - cuts across migration routes. And yet, some reserves offer hope. In Tadoba, tiger density rose 30% over a decade, with buffer populations expanding as prey base improved. In Sundarbans, the reserve is being expanded by more than 1,000 sq km to create space for 101 tigers now crowding its mangrove heartland.India now has more than 50 tiger reserves. Some are full. Others still hold ecological potential, if prey can be restored. The key lies not just in creating new habitat, but in connecting the old - allowing dispersing tigers to move without triggering conflict.Perhaps the tiger today is not just an emblem of wilderness, but a kind of refugee of success - displaced by recovery. The Purulia tiger's trek is both a biometric trail and a metaphor. It is the story of a tiger with nowhere to go, walking east until the land gave way to politics and fear.In the empty classrooms of Pilibhit, in the living room of a Jharkhand family, in the cattle sheds of Bandhavgarh, and in the forests of Gadchiroli now marked by claw and memory, India's national animal is no longer confined to the forest. The tiger has returned. The question is - where can it stay?","India's wild tiger population, once on the brink of collapse, has surged from 1,411 in 2006 to approximately 3,682 in the latest estimate.

PANAJI: Holding him guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, a sessions court in North Goa handed Sandeep Verlekar, 55, a sentence of 6 years and 6 months in prison for assaulting his aged, bed-ridden mother under the influence of alcohol in Merces in 2019.Sandeep was arrested for dragging his 69-year-old mother, Laxmibai, from the bed, hitting her with his fists and leaving her out in the verandah, where she succumbed to her injuries.The court took a lenient view. It considered that Verlekar was an alcoholic and stated that he had no intention to kill his mother. The court directed that the imprisonment of 6 years, 1 month and 11 days already undergone by him be set off, and that he be released upon completion of the balance period.Public prosecutor Roy D'Souza told the court that he should be given the maximum sentence as he had committed a serious offence by assaulting his own bedridden mother. Rohan Desai, appearing under free legal aid, stated that he had been in custody for over 6 years since he was arrested in Nov 2019, and that he had two children.The court observed that the manner in which he had assaulted his mother showed that he had been under the influence of liquor and had no intention of killing her.""I also came to the conclusion that the act of assault committed by the accused was not committed with an intention to kill his own mother. Although it is a death caused, he never intended to kill his own mother. Therefore, according to me, a lenient view has to be taken against the accused,"" Merces sessions judge Irshad Agha said.The sessions court observed that there was no complaint of misbehaviour on his part during the period in custody. ""The period of sentence already undergone acted as rehabilitation for the accused as he could not access liquor. In this context, I do not find any reason that the accused will again turn alcoholic to commit any such act,"" the court stated.","Sandeep verlekar was arrested for dragging his 69-year-old mother, laxmibai, from the bed, hitting her with his fists and leaving her out in the verandah, where she succumbed to her injuries.

Heartbreak, divorce & deadly crimes | Dark Truth Of Failed Marriages | Ft. Anand Handa

BHOPAL/JABALPUR: The Madhya Pradesh high court has refused to interfere with the judgment of a Pocso court in Narmadapuram district awarding 20 years of rigorous imprisonment to a person accused of having sexual relationship with a 17-year-old, whom he married later. The couple now has a child.A division bench of Justices Vivek Agarwal and R K Choubey said the consent of a minor to a sexual relationship was immaterial, and a decision to suspend the sentence of a person convicted for rape under the Pocso Act could be taken only by Supreme Court exercising its power under Article 142 of the Constitution.Earlier, counsel for the appellant contended that coordinate benches granted relief of suspension of sentence even in the case of a 14-year-old girl, whereas in the present case, the age of the survivor was 17 and she was a consenting partner.The bench, however, stated that it was a ""prerogative of the Supreme Court to take a call by exercising its authority under Article 142"".According to the prosecution's case, on June 1, 2023, the rape survivor lodged a police complaint in Itarsi stating that she used to visit her grandmother and became acquainted with the appellant on one such visit. On Feb 14, 2023, he invited her to lunch at his house. There, he raped her and threatened to kill her if she disclosed it to anyone, she alleged, adding he blackmailed and raped her on three more occasions.The accused married the survivor when he came out on bail during the trial.The appellant's counsel pleaded for leniency saying a son was born out of wedlock, and the survivor would be left to take care of him alone. The court, however, said since it was established that the survivor was a minor at the time, the accused could not be absolved of the charge.","Madhya pradesh high court refuses to interfere with pocso court's judgment.

How will the ESI coverage be governed until the finalisation of Rules?

New Labour Codes: The Ministry of Labour has pre-published draft rules under new labour codes on Wednesday. These draft rules are open for public consultation, and stakeholders have been invited to submit objections and suggestions within 45 days (30 days for Industrial Relations Rules). The government has clarified that during the transition period, existing rules will continue to apply until new rules are notified under the Labour Codes, as long as they are consistent with the Codes.Why are the new labour codes important? There are changes in the way provident fund contributions, wages, gratuity are calculated, along with a host of other measures. A uniform definition of “wages” now applies across all four Labour Codes and includes basic pay, dearness allowance and retaining allowance, with a 50 percent cap on allowances. Any allowance, excluding gratuity and retrenchment compensation, that exceeds 50 percent of total remuneration will be added back to wages for statutory calculations, while items such as performance incentives.Puneet Gupta, Partner, People Advisory Services-Tax, EY India says that the draft central rules under the four labour codes provide clarity on several operational aspects that employers have been awaiting.“For instance, the Code on Social Security Rules specify that gratuity will be calculated on ‘wages’ last drawn, excluding components such as annual performance-linked pay, medical reimbursements, stock options, and meal vouchers. This clarification will help organizations estimate their gratuity liability more effectively,” he says.“Similarly, the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Rules introduce important provisions on overtime and working conditions. Workers will now be entitled to double wages for any work beyond 48 hours in a week, and employers must ensure substituted rest days without exceeding ten consecutive working days. These measures aim to balance productivity with employee well-being,” he adds.According to Puneet Gupta, other notable provisions include annual medical check-ups for employees above 40 years in specific sectors such as factory, dock, mine, building & other construction work, creche allowances of at least Rs 500 per child where creche facilities are not provided, and journey allowances for inter-state migrant workers.Apart from the draft rules, the government has also published a list of FAQs on what the new labour codes mean, definition of wages, gratuity calculation etc.As per the provisions of Section 6 of General Clauses Act, 1897, old rules will remain in force till final notification of new rules under the Code, to the extent these are in line with Codes.The definition of “Wages” covers:As mentioned in Section 2(y) of Code on Wages, 2019, leave encashment is not a part of allowances.Gratuity will be applicable w.e.f. 21st Nov, 2025 i.e. date of enforcement of the Code.Gratuity will be applicable w.e.f. 21st Nov, 2025 i.e. date of enforcement of the Code.

Principal employer may engage contract labour for core activities which are ordinarily carried out through contractor, or of intermittent nature or involve sudden increase in volume of work requiring time-bound completion.As per OSH & WC Code, 2020, the employer shall pay to and fro journey allowance to ISMW once in a year from his native place to place of employment.The definition of wage has come into force with notification of the Code w.e.f. 21st Nov, 2025.","Apart from the draft rules, the government has also published a list of faqs on what the new labour codes mean. These include definition of wages, gratuity calculation and 50% rule for allowances. The ministry of labour has pre-published draft rules under new labour codes.

Security Forces Launch Cordon-And-Search Operations In Kishtwar, Doda and Poonch

JAMMU: A village defence guard (VDG) opened fire after allegedly spotting a terror suspect in a remote village in J&K’s Rajouri district, even as security forces intensified surveillance in the upper reaches of Chenab region — Doda and Kishtwar districts — officials said Wednesday.Officials said the VDG fired about six rounds in the air upon allegedly sighting a terror suspect in Dali village in Rajouri’s Kalakote area late Tuesday. None was injured in the firing. “A joint team of the Army and police subsequently rushed to the spot and launched a search operation in the area, but found nothing suspicious,” an official said.A series of anti-terror operations was underway in the upper reaches of Doda, Kishtwar and Ramban districts in Chenab region, especially in areas bordering Udhampur and Kathua districts, officials said. Similar operations were also ongoing in the two frontier districts of Rajouri and Poonch, as well as Reasi, which shares a border with Rajouri-Ramban in Jammu Division and Kulgam in south Kashmir, said officials.Security forces were anticipating that terrorists hiding in non-habituated (higher reaches) may try to enter the mainland, in view of the closure of mountain passes, to get commodities. The intensified operations by Army’s Rashtriya Rifles and J&K Police’s SOG were also extended to a large area in Chenab region, said officials.The Army, meanwhile, stepped up efforts to strengthen grassroots security by imparting training to VDGs — the “first responders” in the security grid — in Doda district. On Tuesday, about 150 VDGs from 17 remote villages along Doda-Chamba border, including women volunteers, underwent intensive training in handling automatic rifles, minor tactics, self-defence, bunker construction and repelling enemy attacks, officials said. The training was being conducted at Shingini Panchayat in Bhalessa, around 90km from Doda district HQ, to equip volunteers with the necessary skills to protect their villages and act as the first line of defence, especially in vulnerable areas, an official said.Separately, a suspected Pakistani drone was spotted hovering briefly over Phulpur area near the International Border in Samba district late Tuesday. “Soon after the sighting, police and BSF personnel rushed to the spot and conducted a thorough search to ascertain whether any payload containing weapons or narcotics had been air-dropped, but found nothing on the ground,” an official said.","Village defence guard opened fire after allegedly spotting a terror suspect in a remote village in j&k’s rajouri district.

NEW DELHI: A government-constituted magisterial inquiry has found that the Goa nightclub where a devastating fire killed 25 people in early December was built illegally on a salt pan and operated for months without valid permissions, pointing to systemic failures and alleged collusion by local authorities, as reported by news agency PTI.The fire broke out late on December 6 during a crowded event after fireworks were set off without adequate safety measures or equipment. The club lacked emergency exits on both floors and was operating without valid permissions. The blaze killed 25 people, including tourists and staff.The report, made public on Wednesday, said the structure of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, North Goa, stood in the middle of a salt pan or water body and was “not permissible under any law”, either current or past, violating the Goa Land Revenue Code and Coastal Zone Regulations.The inquiry revealed that the village panchayat issued an establishment licence to the operator in December 2023, valid only until March 31, 2024. Despite the licence not being renewed, the premises continued to function as a bar and nightclub, with no steps taken by the panchayat to seal it, even though the Goa Panchayat Raj Act empowers such action.Also read: Birch staff tried to douse fire with a glass and water bottle: Survivor Statements recorded during the probe showed that senior panchayat officials were aware of the lapse but failed to inform other departments, which continued granting permissions based on the expired trade licence.The report concluded that this amounted to collusion with the owners and a violation of conduct rules, PTI reported.Serious irregularities were also flagged in the original licensing process. The inquiry noted alleged forgery in the application, including entries added later in different ink, missing mandatory documents such as approved plans and land records, and a hurried approval process completed within days. Officials admitted they had not verified the house number or legality of the structure before issuing the licence.Despite multiple complaints over noise pollution and parking between January 2024 and December 2025, inspections repeatedly recorded “nothing found on the spot”, and directions of the Bombay High Court regarding night patrolling were not followed.Police have registered the case under several Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita sections, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder, negligence, forgery and criminal conspiracy.Eight people have been arrested so far, including co-owners Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra.",A government-constituted magisterial inquiry has found that the goa nightclub where a devastating fire killed 25 people in early december was built illegally on a salt pan.

'Hate-filled agenda': Cong slams arrest of Nagpur Christian priest; demands action against Bajrang Dal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hate-filled-agenda-cong-slams-arrest-of-nagpur-christian-priest-demands-action-against-bajrang-dal/articleshow/126275380.cms,"KC Venugopal (ANI)

NEW DELHI: Congress on Wednesday strongly criticised the BJP following the arrest of a Christian priest and 11 others in Nagpur, Maharashtra, during a Christmas prayer meeting, accusing the party of pursuing a “hate-filled agenda of religious bigotry. ”The Maharashtra Police arrested 12 individuals, including Father Sudhir, a Malayali priest of the CSI South Kerala Diocese, Nagpur Mission, and his wife Jasmine, after a complaint allegedly filed by Bajrang Dal activists. The arrests reportedly took place around 8.00 pm during a Christmas prayer meeting in Nagpur.According to the leaders, people who later went to the police station to enquire about the incident were also taken into custody, and cases were registered against them.Congress MP KC Venugopal in an official post on X described the incident as “highly condemnable” and alleged that the arrest showed the BJP ""uses the state machinery to harass Christians under the bogus pretense of religious conversions.""Venugopal said growing polarisation had made life “unlivable for all minorities” in BJP-ruled states. He demanded that the FIR against the priest be withdrawn immediately and called for strict action against what he described as “Bajrang Dal goons,” whose alleged “hooliganism” led to what he termed a “frivolous case.”He said, “Those who take law into their own hands and destroy the secular fabric envisioned in our Constitution must be the ones receiving punishment - not innocent citizens.”Kerala Assembly Leader of Opposition VD Satheesan also condemned the arrests and sought urgent intervention from the Centre and the Maharashtra government. In a post on X, he tagged PM Modi and Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, demanding the release of all those arrested.In his letter, Satheesan wrote, “I write this letter to register my strong protest and to seek your urgent intervention regarding the arrest of twelve persons, including a Malayali priest, in Nagpur on allegations of forced religious conversion.”He added that Father Sudhir is a native of Amaravila in Thiruvananthapuram district and has been serving in Maharashtra for the past five years, while the remaining 10 arrested individuals are natives of Maharashtra.Satheesan said all the arrested persons are currently being detained at the Benoda Police Station and are likely to be produced before a court shortly. He noted that CSI representatives attempted to secure bail at the police station but were directed to approach the court.Describing the incident as alarming, he said, “This incident is deeply disturbing and raises serious concerns about the violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India, particularly the freedom to profess, practice, and propagate religion. Arresting individuals for conducting a peaceful prayer meeting is unconstitutional and contrary to the spirit of our democratic and secular values. ”","The maharashtra police arrested 12 individuals, including father sudhir, a malayali priest of the csi south kerala diocese, nagpur mission, and his wife jasmine.

SRINAGAR: A sessions court in Jammu and Kashmir has acquitted three people arrested in 2022 for allegedly possessing arms, observing that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused were in “conscious and unauthorised possession” of the arms at the time of their arrest.Additional sessions judge Manjeet Rai on Tuesday said there was a “total absence of independent witnesses or corroborative evidence” to support the UAPA allegations of association with Al-Badr and an intended terrorist act.“Accordingly, all three accused, namely Wajid Ahmad Bhat, Masrat Bilal, and Rameez Ahmad Dar, are acquitted of all charges levelled against them in this case,” the court said, directing police to release them “forthwith, if not required in any other case.”As per the prosecution, during a checking operation at Batamaloo in Srinagar on Oct 10, 2022, the accused allegedly attempted to flee but were apprehended by police. One live grenade was recovered from Bhat, while another live grenade, an AK-47 magazine, and 30 live rounds were recovered from Bilal. Police claimed that Rs 47,500 in cash was recovered from Dar.The chargesheet said the accused disclosed that they were working as “terrorist associates” of Al-Badr and had received the arms and ammunition from a masked overground worker of the organisation in Kulgam in south Kashmir.However, the defence counsel argued that the entire case rested solely on police witnesses, without a single independent civilian witness, despite the admitted presence of a CRPF bunker and shops on three sides of the spot from where the accused were arrested.",A sessions court in jammu and kashmir has acquitted three people arrested in 2022 for allegedly possessing arms.

NEW DELHI: BJP president J P Nadda on Wednesday accused Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge of spreading “falsehood” against the Narendra Modi government and said it was surprising that the main opposition party continued to peddle “lies” despite repeated electoral defeats.Nadda’s remarks came in response to a post by Kharge on X earlier in the day, in which the Congress president alleged that the BJP’s “loot, corruption and misgovernance” dominated the country in 2025.Hitting back, Nadda asked whether the Congress had anything left to do other than “spreading lies”.“The Congress lost in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and it was also completely wiped out in Delhi and Bihar. Mr. Kharge, in 2025, the people of the country rejected all of your lies. Despite this, you are still not giving up on spreading falsehoods,” Nadda said in a post on X.“There is no ground left beneath your feet, yet the amazing thing is that you still don't believe it,” he added, taking a swipe at the Congress through a Hindi couplet.The BJP chief urged Kharge to introspect instead of being “self-obsessed” and accused him of continuing to spread “lies”.In a point-by-point rebuttal of Kharge’s 14 allegations, Nadda rejected claims related to welfare schemes and election processes. On the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, he said, “You lied about MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act), claiming it had been abolished and that the poor had been deprived of their right to work, while the truth is that it has been expanded and strengthened, with the number of workdays increased to 125 and payment guaranteed within 15 days. ”“And it has been linked to village empowerment. Incidentally, your leader was meeting anti-India people at George Soros-funded Global Progressive Alliance when the discussion was happening on it [Viksit Bharat-Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill (VB-G RAM G)],” Nadda said, asking Kharge, “Isn't that right?”On allegations of “vote chori”, Nadda questioned how many petitions the Congress had filed before the Election Commission.“You once again lied about the SIR (Special Intensive Revision) and the BLO (booth level officer), claiming that people's right to vote was snatched away and that the BJP's vote-chori was caught. Mr. Kharge, it was the people of this country who caught your lies and your falsehoods were also rejected in court,” he said.Referring to Bihar, Nadda added, “What happened in Bihar, Mr. Kharge? How many of your booth level agents (BLAs) actually went to the ground? There was no theft of people's votes. They exercised their right to vote and shut down your shop of 'booth-theft and lies'.”Responding to Kharge’s criticism of the economy, Nadda said India was now the world’s fourth-largest economy and the fastest growing amid global uncertainty, contrasting it with the UPA years when the country was counted among the “fragile five”.“India's foreign exchange reserves are at a record high today, but you won't see it because you intend to defame the country,” he charged.On Kharge’s remarks on Aravalli mining, Nicobar, Hasdeo and Mumbai mangroves, Nadda accused the Congress of “hypocrisy” and spreading “falsehood”.“During the Congress rule, the hills were openly plundered. The Congress systematically destroyed the Aravalli range through extensive mining. Your government didn't save the Aravallis; instead, it sold them off. We, on the other hand, imposed a ban and limited mining in accordance with the court's decision,” he said.Nadda also targeted the Congress over its stance on the judiciary, alleging that no party had damaged its reputation as much.“When a judgment didn't go your way, you brought an impeachment motion against the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Now you've brought an impeachment motion against a judge of the Madras High Court. You insulted two Chief Justices while they were still in office,” he said.",Bjp president j p nadda accused congress chief mallikarjun kharge of spreading “falsehood” against the narendra modi government.

SRINAGAR: The J&K high court set aside Wednesday the conviction of an elderly woman in a 1979 murder case from Uri near the LoC in Baramulla district of north Kashmir, citing 46 years of prolonged proceedings and her age-related infirmities.A single-judge bench of Justice Sanjay Parihar ruled that the sentence of Shameema Begam should be treated as already undergone, saying no useful purpose would be served by maintaining a substantive jail term after decades of litigation. The court ordered closure of the case, while saying that “the offence was committed in a heat of passion without premeditation.”The killing dates back to July 10, 1979, when Begam of Bijhama village struck her mother-in-law with an axe during a domestic quarrel. The older woman had intervened in an argument when Begam was repeatedly asked to irrigate maize fields and later died of head wounds four days later.Begam was arrested on July 21, 1979, and released on bail on Oct 25 that year. Police registered an FIR at Bijhama police station under sections 326 and 324 of Ranbir Penal Code, the criminal law then in force in J&K under Dogra-era statutes. After the victim died, the charge was converted to murder under section 302 RPC.The trial dragged on for three decades. On July 16, 2009, a trial court convicted Begam under section 304 RPC, holding that the act was culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and sentenced her to five years of rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs 2,000. She was arrested after conviction but released on bail within days — on July 28, 2009.Begam appealed the verdict. The appeal remained pending for more than 16 years before coming up for final hearing. Her lawyer Nida Nazir said extraordinary delay in both trial and appeal violated Begam’s right to a speedy trial and warranted a sympathetic approach.HC called the case “a testimony to the systemic delay in the disposal of criminal cases”. While delay cannot ordinarily benefit a convict, the court said, it cannot ignore the reality of accused people remaining trapped in the criminal justice system for decades. “The appeal is accordingly disposed of,” the court said, bringing an end to one of Kashmir’s longest-running criminal cases.",Shameema begam struck her mother-in-law with an axe during a domestic quarrel.

Terror, Tariffs, Polls: PM Modi’s Mic-Drop Moments That Set The Agenda In 2025

NEW DELHI: The Pragati-led ecosystem for monitoring of projects and flagship schemes has helped accelerate projects worth more than Rs 85 lakh crore in the past decade, PM Modi said Wednesday while chairing the 50th Pragati meeting online with secretaries and chief secretaries.Modi described the milestone as a symbol of the deep transformation India has witnessed in the culture of governance over the last decade. In a statement, the PMO said Modi shared clear expectations for the next phase, outlining his ""vision of reform, perform and transform, saying reform to simplify, perform to deliver, transform to impact"". He said reform must mean moving from process to solutions, simplifying procedures and making systems more friendly for 'ease of living and ease of doing business'.It added the PM spoke how outcome-driven governance has been strengthened through Pragati. He also said transformation must be measured by what citizens actually feel about timely services, faster grievance resolution and improved 'ease of living'.""The PM underlined that when decisions are timely, coordination is effective and accountability is fixed, the speed of govt functioning naturally increases and its impact becomes visible directly in citizens' lives,"" it said.On Wednesday, the PM reviewed five infrastructure projects across sectors, including road, railways, power, water resources and coal, with a cumulative cost of more than Rs 40,000 crore.During a review of the PM SHRI scheme, Modi said that the scheme must become a national benchmark for holistic and future-ready school education and added that implementation should be outcome oriented rather than infrastructure centric. He asked all chief secretaries to closely monitor the scheme and asked them to make efforts to see that PM SHRI schools become benchmark for other schools of state govts.He suggested senior officers should undertake field visits to evaluate the performance of PM SHRI schools.Recalling the origin of Pragati, PM said as Gujarat CM, he had launched the technology-enabled Swagat platform (State Wide Attention on Grievances by Application of Technology) to understand and resolve public grievances with discipline, transparency and time-bound action. Building on that experience, after assuming office at the Centre, he expanded the same spirit nationally through Pragati, bringing large projects, major programmes and grievance redressal onto one integrated platform for review, resolution, and follow-up.",The pragati-led ecosystem for monitoring of projects and flagship schemes has helped accelerate projects worth more than rs 85 lakh crore in the past decade.

Australia, US And UK Raise Alarm Over Fake Rabies Vaccine As India Pushes Back On Claims

NEW DELHI: The Centre has banned the manufacture, sale and distribution of all oral formulations of nimesulide above 100 mg in immediate-release form, citing risk to human health and the availability of safer alternatives.In a notification issued on Dec 29 and published in The Gazette of India, the health ministry said it was satisfied that continued use of higher-dose nimesulide was ""likely to involve risk to human beings"" and that the prohibition was necessary in public interest.Nimesulide is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used for pain, inflammation and fever. The ban applies only to oral formulations above 100 mg in immediate-release form and takes effect immediately. Lower-dose formulations are not covered.The order has been issued under Section 26A of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, after consultation with the Drugs Technical Advisory Board (DTAB), and bars manufacturers, distributors and sellers from producing or supplying the banned formulations.Nimesulide has been under regulatory scrutiny for over a decade. In 2011, the central govt prohibited six drugs, including nimesulide, following DTAB recommendations, and barred its use in children below 12 years amid concerns over liver toxicity.Earlier this year, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) also flagged safety concerns, recommending restrictions on nimesulide use in patients below 18 years and above 60 years, and advising that formulations above 100 mg be banned. In India, the drug is sold under brands such as Nimulid, Nimtex and Nicip, with Nise among the largest-selling brands.Welcoming the move, Dr Rommel Tickoo, director, internal medicine, Max Hospital, Saket, said, ""This is a prudent and timely decision taken by govt. The restriction on high-dose immediate-release nimesulide addresses a long-standing safety concern, especially when misused or taken without supervision. With safer NSAID alternatives readily available, limiting exposure to higher doses is clearly in the interest of patient safety.

‘Amit Shah’s Hands Were Shaking’: Rahul Gandhi Hits Out At BJP-RSS, Warns EC In ‘Vote Chori’ Rally

NEW DELHI: After its delegation met the full bench of the Election Commission on Wednesday, Trinamool Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee alleged that 'vote chori' (vote theft) is not happening in the EVM rather it is being done through manipulation of electoral rolls and Congress and other opposition parties failed to catch it in states like Haryana, Maharashtra, Delhi and Bihar where they lost in the assembly polls.""If they would have caught that - BJP would have lost in these states,"" Banerjee said while highlighting that TMC will not let this happen in West Bengal which goes to the polls in a few months.While training his guns at the EC and BJP, Banerjee urged like-minded parties to catch the votetheft, allegedly being done through manipulation using software in voter rolls.Banerjee, the Lok Sabha MP from Diamond Harbour said that the battle against “vote theft” cannot be won through debates on TV channels or social media and asserted that opposition parties - the Congress and others will have to be on the ground, at polling booths, to thwart manipulation at the stage of special intensive revision (SIR) and special summary revision.The remarks came after a 10 - member TMC delegation led by Banerjee met the Election Commission led by chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar and raised various concerns related to the Special Intensive Revision process in West Bengal. Banerjee said he told the CEC that “you are weaponising the electoral rolls”.“The EC has failed to address most of the concerns that we raised. We will not accept the final voter list if it has discrepancies”, Banerjee said alleging collusion between the EC and BJP.He said that the TMC was ready to ""fight it legally"" if required going forward. The 10-member delegation included MPs Derek O'Brien, Saket Gokhale, Kalyan Banerjee, Nadimul Haque, Ritabrata Banerjee and Mamata Thakur, and ministers from West Bengal. In the meeting with the Election Commission led by chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar they raised various concerns related to the SIR process in West Bengal. Banerjee said he told the CEC that “you are trying to weaponise the electoral rolls”.Banerjee also alleged that Kumar was ""aggressive"" during the meeting and challenged the CEC to release the CCTV footage of the nearly two and a half hour meeting. He said the party would fight it legally if EC failed to address its concerns on SIR.Pointing that people wanted to vote for opposition parties like Cong, AAP and RJD in Haryana, Maharashtra, Delhi and Bihar, Banerjee said, “If the Congress had been able to catch this it would have won and the BJP would have lost. I appeal to all like-minded parties, especially those in the opposition: the theft is happening in the voter list, in the software, not in the EVM. You are failing to understand what algorithms and software are being run to disenfranchise and remove voters,” he asserted.He also questioned the EC's move to retroactively introduce a new category termed ""logical discrepancies"", summoning 1.36 crore voters for hearing on different grounds, including issues like unreasonable age gaps between parents and children, name and surname mismatches and address related issues. The party has demanded why the detailed discrepancy list has not been made public.Among the various issues raised with the EC, the TMC has challenged the poll panel to come out with the list of Bangladeshis and Rohingyas among the 58 lakh voters whose names have been deleted in the draft electoral roll. ""There is selective targeting, allegations of infiltration, which are leaked to malign West Bengal,"" Banerjee alleged.","Tmc's abhishek banerjee urged like-minded parties to catch the votetheft, allegedly being done through manipulation using software in voter rolls.
