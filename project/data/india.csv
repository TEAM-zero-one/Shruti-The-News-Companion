NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing row over three language policy , defence minister Rajnath Singh Friday emphasised the importance of linguistic unity, national integration and valour of India’s brave queens. Addressing the audience at a theatrical tribute to Tamil queen Rani Velu Nachiyar , Singh reaffirmed that languages in India are not in competition but in cooperation, stating, “Hindi and all Indian languages strengthen each other.”Organised by BJP’s women’s wing, the event aimed to bring her inspiring story to a wider audience. “There should be no attempts to divide the nation in the name of language. A Hindi speaker is not an opponent of Tamil; rather, we believe in strengthening all Indian languages together,” he added. He said India’s linguistic diversity is a source of strength and unity, not discord.Addressing recent debates on language, he asserted that BJP remains committed to respecting and safeguarding all Indian languages, including Tamil and Hindi. He highlighted initiatives like Kashi Tamil Sangamam, which celebrate India’s linguistic and cultural diversity, and reiterated that promoting one language should never mean undermining another. He expressed concern over TN govt prioritising opposition to Hindi over providing education in Tamil for crucial fields like medicine and engineering, emphasising that BJP works with a “positive agenda” for the benefit of all.Singh paid tribute to the fearless spirit of India’s women warriors, including Nachiyar, first Indian queen to wage an armed struggle against the British. He acknowledged the significant contributions of other brave queens like Rani Lakshmibai, Rani Durgavati and Rani Chennamma, who played pivotal roles in India’s history.","Rajnath singh reaffirmed that languages in india are not in competition but in cooperation. “there should be no attempts to divide the nation in the name of language.

KOCHI: Central Board of Film Certification has ordered 17 changes to Malayalam movie ""Empuraan"" starring superstar Mohanlal following backlash over its alleged portrayal of 2002 Gujarat riots.The movie was released on March 27 and the filmmakers claimed it quickly crossed Rs 100 crore at box office. However, criticism from BJP and RSS members in Kerala erupted soon after its release.RSS-affiliated publication Organiser accused the film of pushing a divisive narrative, alleging it was ""purposefully designed to reinforce image of Hindus as primary aggressors during the 2002 riots"".The article also criticised Mohanlal, claiming that his participation in the project ""betrays his loyal fan base"".CBFC's office in Kerala reviewed the film following intervention from central govt, according to sources. The board suggested edits and if the revised version is submitted by Monday, it is expected to be approved for screening in the following days.The film's producers have agreed to the modifications. Producer Gokulam Gopalan said Saturday he had instructed director Prithviraj Sukumaran to make changes ""if any scenes or dialogues in the movie had hurt anyone"".The controversy has sparked political reactions across party lines. Congress praised ""Empuraan"" for what they described as its depiction of the ""reality behind Gujarat riots"". Kerala unit of Congress wrote on X: ""Like Grok, Empuraan has demolished the Sangh Varsity!""While BJP state chief Rajeev Chandrasekhar initially wished success for the film on social media, several BJP and RSS functionaries later condemned it.Sangh-linked organisations like Hindu Aikyavedi and Bharatiya Yuvamorcha criticised the Mohanlal-starrer. But BJP state secretary P Sudheer denied reports that the party's core committee discussed the controversy.

Why Rajasthan Day is changing calendars,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-rajasthan-day-is-changing-calendars/articleshow/119732584.cms,"Get the latest lifestyle updates on Times of India, along with Navratri Wishes, Eid Messages and quotes !



On March 30, 1949, four princely states — Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bikaner, and Jaisalmer — joined hands to form Greater Rajasthan. The event, officiated by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at Jaipur’s City Palace, marked a near-complete unification of Rajputana and laid the foundation of modern Rajasthan. Since then, March 30 has been celebrated as Rajasthan Day .This year, the Bhajan Lal Sharma-led BJP govt has announced a calendar shift — Rajasthan Day will now be celebrated annually on Chaitra Shukla Pratipada , the first day of the Hindu calendar. Coincidentally, in 2025, that falls on March 30 — but in future years, the date will vary. In 2026, for example, Chaitra Pratipada will fall on March 19.Justifying the change, Sharma said the date aligns with India’s traditional calendar and reflects Rajasthan’s Sanatan cultural heritage . He cited Sardar Patel’s 1949 speech noting that the foundation of Greater Rajasthan happened on Varsha Pratipada (the New Year in Vikram Samvat 2006), which coincided with March 30 that year. The state government has earmarked Rs 25 crore for this year’s celebrations and argues that marking the day by the Indian calendar restores cultural continuity.Critics say the change politicises a historical event. Historian R S Khangarot warns that it dilutes the historical accuracy of March 30, 1949 — a date etched in records as the day Rajasthan was officially formed. “Facts must remain facts,” he said, adding that using a movable date risks distorting public memory of the actual event.The Rajasthan Board’s Class X history textbook also affirms March 30, 1949, as the date when Rajasthan was officially named and unified.The change has triggered a political row, with the opposition Congress accusing the BJP of pushing an RSS-backed cultural agenda. Leader of Opposition Tikaram Jully called the move “unnecessary saffronisation,” asking if similar shifts would be proposed for Independence Day or Republic Day. “Rajasthan Day is a political and historical event, not a religious festival,” he said.The decision has roots in the long-standing campaign of the Navvarsh Samaroh Samiti (NSS), an Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-aligned body established in 1952. Since 2001, NSS has lobbied successive governments to mark Rajasthan Day according to the Vikram Samvat calendar, claiming historical evidence that Patel’s ceremony coincided with Chaitra Pratipada.Supporters of the move, including Sanskrit scholars and govt officials, argue that the Vikram Samvat is a broadly Indian calendar, used not only by Hindus but also by Jains, Buddhists, and Sikhs. They contend that recognising this system for a state event enhances India’s civilisational identity.At the heart of debate is the question — is Rajasthan Day a historical milestone or a cultural celebration? And must the two coincide?","On march 30, 1949, four princely states — jaipur, jodhpur, bikaner, and jaisalmer — joined hands to form greater rajasthan.

The area has been cordoned off and reinforcements deployed.According to official sources, the slain policemen includes a head constable and two constables. The bodies were yet to be evacuated from the site as the operation continues.Grenades and rocket fire rocked the area with multiple explosions. “The gunfire continued throughout the day,” an official said late at night, adding that the wounded security personnel were taken to Kathua and Jammu hospitals, where they are reported to be in stable condition.The attackers are believed to be the same group that managed to escape after a brief gunfight Sunday evening near Sanyal village in Hiranagar sector, close to the Pakistan border. Sufain’s forests are about 35km from Sanyal village.The security forces had closed in on the terrorists hiding in a remote, mountain hut — one of many built by nomadic herders who roam the area with their livestock. But they slipped away, triggering a manhunt across the region.The search entered its fourth day, with the Army, NSG, BSF, CRPF, and J&K police deploying advanced surveillance tools, bulletproof vehicles, UAVs, drones, and sniffer dogs.On Monday, search teams found four loaded magazines of an M4 carbine, two grenades, a bulletproof jacket, sleeping bags, tracksuits, and materials for making IEDs.

NEW DELHI: While India meteorological department (IMD) is largely known for providing weather alerts and warnings in the public interest, benefiting various sectors and the common people, the country’s national weather forecaster has now emerged as a key govt scientific agency generating revenue from its range of services.Becoming the biggest money earner of the ministry of earth sciences (MoES), IMD has earned more than Rs 226 crore since 2022-23, with a substantial amount coming to its kitty from the aviation meteorological services provided to Airports Authority of India (AAI).MoES informed a parliamentary panel that another institution — Chennai-based National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) — has developed about 42 technologies which were transferred to industry on paid basis. It earned more than Rs 24 crore in the past three years. Besides rendering the aviation met services to AAI, IMD earned revenue by sale of meteorological data, periodical weather reports and testing/calibration of equipment.Data shared with the panel — parliamentary standing committee on science and &technology, environment, forests and climate change — shows that the IMD earned nearly Rs 66 crore by providing aviation met services during the first six months of 2024-25 financial year. “This (generating revenue from its services) will not only help the ministry to generate additional resources for augmenting important programmes, but also transfer the benefit of these technologies to the society at large,” said the panel, headed by BJP Lok Sabha member Bhubaneswar Kalita.Keeping in mind the specialised requirements of the renewable energy sector, a new data product suitable to the requirements of the sector has also been developed.The medium range forecasts (up to 10 days) of near surface variables (rainfall, temperature, surface pressure, humidity and winds) and upper air variables (winds, temperature humidity and geopotential height) are used for monitoring and early warning of severe weather events.Though these forecasts are used by the IMD and other national and state level disaster agencies, special steps have been taken in the past few years to make the data available to the paid clients in a secure data access.","India meteorological department (imd) is largely known for providing weather alerts and warnings in the public interest.

LUCKNOW: 50-year-old Anuj Kanaujia, a sharpshooter of the Mukhtar Ansari gang , was shot dead in a police encounter in Jamshedpur on Saturday night, the UPSTF said.The operation, conducted by a joint team of Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force (STF) Gorakhpur unit and Jharkhand Police, also left STF deputy superintendent of Police (DySP) DK Shahi injured.Kanaujia, who was on the run for over five years, was wanted in 23 criminal cases, including murder, extortion, land grabbing, and arms smuggling. The UP DGP Prashant Kumar recently increased his bounty from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2.5 lakh for any information leading to his arrest in an effort to track him down.“The operation was launched based on specific intelligence inputs regarding Kanaujia’s movement in Jamshedpur. As the police team attempted to apprehend him, Kanaujia opened fire, shooting nearly 20 rounds and even hurling a bomb in a bid to escape. This forced the security forces to retaliate, leading to a high-intensity gunfight. During the exchange of fire, DySP DK Shahi sustained a gunshot wound to his shoulder but continued leading the operation. Eventually, Kanaujia was neutralised after sustaining multiple bullet injuries. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival,” said Additional DG, law and order, Amitabh Yash.Following the encounter, police recovered two pistols, a large cache of live cartridges, and mobile phones from the site. The mobile phones are now being examined for possible leads on his criminal network, an officer privy to the probe said.Kanaujia, a resident of Bahlolpur village in Chiraiyakot, Mau, had a long history of violent crimes and was one of the most feared operatives of the Mukhtar Ansari gang. His criminal record spanned multiple districts, with six cases registered against him in Mau’s Kotwali police station, five in Rani Ki Sarai, two in Dakshin Tola, and three in Chiraiyakot, apart from several others in Ghazipur and Azamgarh, the officer of STF added.In recent years, police intensified efforts to crack down on Kanaujia and his associates. As part of the statewide anti-mafia drive, authorities demolished his house in Azamgarh using a bulldozer, while his family members were booked under the Gangster Act and sent to jail, the officer added.","50-year-old anuj kanaujia, a sharpshooter of the mukhtar ansari gang, was shot dead in a police encounter in jamshedpur on saturday night.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The row over Mohanlal-starrer, ‘ L2: Empuraan ’ continued to trigger political reactions in Kerala Saturday with Congress accusing BJP of showing intolerance towards the movie citing intense criticism being raised against it on right-wing social media handles.However, state BJP functionaries chose not to make any adverse remarks against the Prithviraj-directed film, even as the party and Sangh Parivar activists continued to criticise it.The film has become a topic of hot debate over its critique of right-wing politics and covert mention of the Gujarat riots.AICC general secretary K C Venugopal alleged that BJP’s criticism of the movie was part of the intolerance of Sangh Parivar. Pointing out the recently released movies like ‘The Accidental Prime Minister’ and ‘Emergency’, he said such films were critical of Congress, but BJP welcomed all of them. “BJP should introspect whether it is right to show intolerance only when they are criticised,” he said.Venugopal added the uproar against the movie should be seen in the context of recent SC verdict quashing an FIR lodged by Gujarat Police against Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi for allegedly posting an edited video of a provocative song. The Congress MP recalled SC’s observation that even if a large number of persons dislike the views expressed by another, the right of the person to express the views must be respected and protected.Kerala education minister V Sivankutty came out against the reported move to re-censor the film. He said Gujarat riot and Godhra were part of Indian history and generations would see and know about it whatever scissors have been used to cut it.. “Freedom of expression is cornerstone of democracy,” Sivankutty said.Meanwhile, junior minority affairs minister George Kurian said he hasn’t yet seen the movie, but will watch it.A section of right-wing outfits have demanded the revoking of Lt Col rank of Mohanlal in the wake controversial contents in the movie.",The film has become a topic of hot debate over its critique of right-wing politics and covert mention of the gujarat riots.

LONDON: An Indian librarian working at Cambridge university’s Trinity College has lost an employment tribunal case in which she was suing the college for race discrimination after not being allowed to take an entire academic term off to go to India.Dr Havovi Anklesaria , who has worked in the library of Trinity College since 1994, wanted to take four months off from Dec to April each year to go to India to care for her parents and visit other family members.Anklesaria is an Indian national with indefinite leave to remain in the UK. She used to return to India annually, from mid-Dec to mid-April, as she had previously been on a casual contract with the college. However, she was switched to a permanent contract in Sept 2021 and at that point the college said it could not allow her to take those four months off and she could take three months off in the summer instead.She then took Trinity College to the employment tribunal, claiming direct and indirect race discrimination based on her race. She also claimed victimisation, saying she was victimised for bringing employment tribunal proceedings as she was not offered invigilation work between April 2022 and Sept 2022.Andrew Speak, human resources director at the college, told the tribunal the college was agreeable to Anklesaria having extended breaks each year, provided it “is not for an entire term”.Speak said that would apply to anyone of any nationality who is on a permanent contract.Employment judge Freshwater dismissed her claims for indirect and direct race discrimination and victimisation. He said: “No employee working for the college under a permanent contract is allowed to be absent from work for an entire term. Anklesaria was offered a contract that would have permitted her to have a break of three months over the summer. She did not accept this. We do not find that she was treated less favourably because of her nationality.”He added she was not offered invigilation work because a decision was taken to offer it to post-doctoral members and postgraduate students instead.","Dr havovi anklesaria has worked in the library of trinity college since 1994.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari on Saturday launched a fierce attack on CM Mamata Banerjee , calling her a "" traitor "" over her remarks during her recent visit to the United Kingdom.""Mamata Banerjee is a traitor... I have written to S Jaishankar to bring all the footage and take strict action against her. Action should be taken against the traitor,"" Adhikari said.In a letter to EAM Jaishankar, Adhikari demanded a ban on Mamata's foreign visits, alleging that she had ""deliberately tarnished India’s reputation on foreign soil.""The row stems from Banerjee’s address at Oxford University's Kellogg College, where she appeared to ""downplay"" India's economic growth. When a speaker mentioned that India had surpassed the UK as the world's fifth-largest economy and was projected to become the largest by 2060, Banerjee responded, ""I will differ that.""Adhikari termed her response ""treasonous"" and an ""embarrassment for every Bengali and Indian."" He accused Banerjee of displaying ""admiration for colonial rulers"" and urged the ministry of external affairs to investigate her statements. Citing guidelines that require MEA approval for official foreign visits, he suggested her comments should be grounds for disqualification.Banerjee’s UK visit also saw protests at Kellogg College, where demonstrators questioned her stance on election violence in West Bengal and the RG Kar College case. BJP IT Cell head Amit Malviya shared a video of the protests, criticizing Banerjee's remarks. ""West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has a problem with India becoming the world's largest economy... This is truly shameful,"" he posted on X.The Trinamool Congress has yet to respond to the allegations.","West bengal leader of opposition suvendu adhikari launched a fierce attack on cm mamata banerjee.

CHANDIGARH: A special CBI court here acquitted former Punjab and Haryana high court judge Nirmal Yadav and three others on Saturday in the 17-year-old high-profile cash-at-judge’s-door case.Yadav, sitting in her car in the parking of the court complex due to a fractured leg, said she had full faith in the judiciary as the verdict came. Vishal Garg Narwana, the defence lawyer, asserted that the court decision proved that the former judge was innocent and there was no proof against her in the case. “Truth has prevailed,” he said. A copy of the judgment is awaited.The case emerged in 2008 when a bag with Rs 15 lakh mistakenly ended up at the Chandigarh residence of another judge, Nirmaljit Kaur. She called the police. The probe revealed the money was allegedly intended for Justice Yadav “to influence a decision related to a property deal”. The name of Haryana’s then additional advocate general Sanjeev Bansal also surfaced in the case.The names of property dealer Rajeev Gupta, Nirmal Singh, and Delhi-based hotelier Ravinder Singh Bhasin also surfaced in the case. The main accused, Bansal, died of an illness in 2016, during the trial, complicating matters. As the probe progressed, Justice Yadav was transferred to Uttarakhand HC and retired in 2011.The case faced several hurdles. Initially, Chandigarh police probed the matter, but within 15 days it was handed over to Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). In 2009, CBI filed a closure report, but CBI court rejected it and ordered a re-investigation. In 2011, CBI filed a chargesheet naming Justice Nirmal Yadav and several others as accused. But, the case was delayed multiple times due to legal complexities.In 2010, the then chief justice granted permission to prosecute Yadav. After receiving approval from the President in 2011, a chargesheet was filed on March 3, 2011. In 2013, the CBI court framed charges and began the trial. The Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 affected proceedings. The trial saw over 300 hearings, but frequent lengthy cross-examinations by the defence delayed proceedings.By 2024, testimony of 76 witnesses was done, with 10 witnesses retracting their statements. CBI special court reserved its judgment on Thursday.","Yadav, sitting in her car in the parking of the court complex due to a fractured leg, said she had full faith in the judiciary as the verdict came.

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Nirupam on Satuday called on Mumbai Police to shut down street-side Shawarma stalls and other non-vegetarian vendors during the festival of Navratri, claiming that such sales hurt Hindu sentiments .""From tomorrow, the holy festival of Navratri will start. A large number of Hindu devotees will observe fast and worship the goddess. In such a situation, Shawarma stalls are open on the roads in Mumbai, and non-veg is sold there. This is hurting Hindu sentiments,"" Nirupam stated.He claimed that there are over 250 Shawarma stalls in Andheri East alone and announced that he, along with party members, would approach the MIDC Police Station to demand action against street vendors selling non-vegetarian food during Navratri.""Today, we are going to MIDC PS against this and requesting the police to shut down the shops selling non-veg on the streets at least during the days of Navratri,"" he said.Nirupam clarified that his demand does not apply to restaurants operating indoors but only to street vendors. ""Someone selling non-veg in a closed restaurant, they can do it, but selling non-veg on the streets during Navratri days definitely hurts the sentiments of Hindus,"" he added.Nirupam’s comments drew sharp criticism from the Nationalist Congress Party (Sharad Pawar faction), with national spokesperson Anish Gawande dismissing his statements as mere theatrics.""Yesterday, he had a problem with Kunal Kamra. Today, he has a problem with Shawarma stalls. Tomorrow, he will have a problem with you and me. Religion and loyalty to party leadership are just excuses. The real goal is to put on a tamasha that distracts us from real issues,"" Gawande said.Nirupam’s demand comes amid similar restrictions being implemented in other regions during Navratri. The Maihar district administration in Madhya Pradesh has banned the sale of meat, fish, and eggs within Maihar Nagar Palika from March 30 to April 7 in observance of the festival.

Omar Abdullah links Jammu terror surge to troop shift during 2020 China standoff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/omar-abdullah-links-jammu-terror-surge-to-troop-shift-during-2020-china-standoff/articleshow/119723610.cms,"Get the latest lifestyle updates on Times of India, along with Navratri Wishes, Eid Messages and quotes !



Srinagar/Jammu: J&K CM Omar Abdullah attributed Saturday the rise in terrorist activities in Jammu to the redeployment of troops to Ladakh following Chinese incursions in April 2020.“These (infiltrations and attacks) are not new. For the past three or four years, you have witnessed such cases in many areas of Jammu, including Reasi and even Jammu city,” Abdullah said after visiting the families of four policemen killed in an anti-terrorist operation in Kathua.Following multiple Chinese incursions in 2020, the Army deployed the “Uniform Force” of its specialised counterinsurgency unit Rashtriya Rifles to eastern Ladakh, reducing troop presence in Jammu. This created opportunities for Pakistan to push infiltrators, according to security experts.“When China attacked or entered Ladakh, we needed the Army to tackle the situation there,” the CM said. “The Army stationed in Jammu was sent to Ladakh, creating a vacuum, which is now being rectified gradually.”The region remains in mourning following the deaths of four policemen in Thursday’s gunfight in the forested Sufain area of Kathua. The slain men — head constable Jagbir Singh, constables Tariq Ahmad, Balwinder Singh Chib, and Jaswant Singh — were killed after security forces came under fire from terrorists hiding in the woods. The bodies were retrieved Friday and Saturday.Heartbreak rippled through villages as grieving families and neighbours gathered to pay their respects. In Reasi district’s Chamba, residents consoled the family of Tariq, who had promised to be home for Eid (March 31). He leaves behind his wife and a four-year-old daughter.In Khour of Jammu district, Jagbir’s family — his wife, daughter, and son — struggled to process their loss. Similar grief unfolded in Kathua’s Kanna Chak, where villagers gathered at the home of Chib, and in Londi Morh of Hiranagar, where Jaswant’s elderly parents, wife, and two young sons were inconsolable.CM Abdullah assured that the next of kin of the slain policemen would receive govt jobs and other relief under existing policies. He led the wreath-laying ceremony for Jagbir, while BJP MP Jugal Kishore Sharma and former J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina attended constable Tariq’s last rites.Two Pakistani terrorists, suspected to be affiliated with Jaish-e-Mohammed group, were also killed and weapons were seized from the site, DGP Nalin Prabhat said.Security forces expanded their search operation to nearby areas, including Billawar Heights, to track down any remaining terrorists, the DGP said. People’s Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF), a shadow outfit linked to Pakistan-based Jaish, claimed responsibility for the attack.CM Abdullah said attacks must be prevented to end the cycle of mourning. “For that, we have to control terrorism,” he said.Between May and Dec last year, J&K saw a wave of terrorist attacks, prompting heightened counteroffensives. More than 30 terrorists were killed before the region’s harsh winter set in, while security forces suffered 25 casualties — 19 in Jammu and six in Kashmir.This year, eight security personnel have died in J&K, including one soldier in Kashmir and seven in Jammu. In Feb, terrorists targeted an Army patrol with an IED near the LoC in Akhnoor, killing Capt Karamjit Singh Bakshi and Naik Mukesh Singh Manhas.According to security officials, the terrorists killed in Kathua were part of a new group infiltrating from Pakistan. The terrorists are believed to be the same group that managed to escape after a brief gunfight last Sunday evening near Sanyal village in Hiranagar sector, close to the Pakistan border. Sufain’s forests are about 35km from Sanyal village.Security sources estimate that 70 to 80 Pakistani terrorists remain active in J&K, with 55 to 60 operating in Jammu. These highly trained operatives, armed with M4 carbines and thermal imaging devices, work in small groups and exploit the rugged terrain, posing a persistent threat to the region’s stability.","J&k cm omar abdullah attributed the rise in terrorist activities in jammu to the redeployment of troops to ladakh following chinese incursions in april 2020. “these (infiltrations and attacks) are not new.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar on Saturday addressed concerns about loan waivers, making it clear that farmers must repay their crop loans by March 31.He admitted that election promises don’t always translate into immediate action and that future decisions will depend on prevailing circumstances.However, he assured that 0% interest loans would be available to ease the burden on farmers.""Whether it's Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis or deputy CM Eknath Shinde , the focus remains on working for the welfare of the people. Recently, many citizens raised concerns about the election manifesto's promise of loan waivers. As of March 28, I want to clearly inform the people of Maharashtra through this program to repay their crop loans by March 31. Promises made during elections don't always translate directly into actions… Considering the current circumstances, decisions will be made in the future. However, for now and even next year, loans taken must be repaid. On a positive note, arrangements have been made to avail of loans at 0% interest,"" Pawar said at an event in Baramati.Discussing the state's financial commitments, Pawar highlighted the challenges of managing Maharashtra’s budget of Rs 7.20 lakh crore. He pointed out that waiving electricity bills alone costs the government nearly Rs 65,000 crore. ""Whatever was said does not come into action directly because while presenting a budget of Rs 7.20 lakh crore, electricity bills worth about Rs 65,000 crore have been waived off, meaning you don't, but we, the government, have to pay it,"" he said.Pawar also outlined the financial burden of various welfare schemes, including Rs 45,000 crore allocated for the Ladki Bahin Yojana . Additionally, Rs 3.5 lakh crore is required for salaries, pensions, and loan interest payments. ""If we add Rs 65,000 crore and Rs 3.5 lakh crore, nearly Rs 4.25 lakh crore is already spent. The remaining funds have to cover essential expenses like school books, uniforms, electricity, water, and roads,"" he added.Recalling his recent visit to Kolhapur, Pawar mentioned that his colleague Hasan Mushrif had urged him to address the issue of crop loan waivers, as many farmers were awaiting relief. ""Yesterday, I was in Kolhapur, and even there, Hasan Mushrif asked me to quickly decide as people are not paying and are waiting… Hence, we will take a decision after assessing the situation. Right now, the conditions do not allow for a waiver, so this year’s and next year’s loans must be repaid,"" Pawar said.To support farmers, he reiterated that the state has arranged for 0% interest loans, covering bank interest costs of Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,200 crore. ""I have passed that on to the banks,"" he added.","Ajit pawar, maharashtra deputy chief minister and finance minister, addressed concerns about loan waivers.

NEW DELHI: Slamming permission to banks to hike charges on ATM withdrawals, Congress Saturday cited a series of levies by banks coupled with price rise and “unbridled loot” to accuse Modi govt of turning banks into “collection agents”.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said, “Our banks have been unfortunately made collection agents by Modi govt which has extracted at least Rs 43,500 crore due to non-maintenance of minimum balance from savings accounts & Jan Dhan accounts combined, between 2018 and 2024.”“Other bank charges to loot citizens: inactivity fee which is Rs 100-200 per year. Bank statement issuance fee is Rs 50-100. Rs 20-25 per quarter is charged for SMS alerts. Banks charge 1-3% as loan processing fees ,” he said, adding if a loan is paid on time, loan pre-closure charges are levied by banks, and NEFT & demand draft charges are an additional burden while KYC updates like signature changes also attract fees.","Congress president mallikarjun kharge said, “our banks have been unfortunately made collection agents by modi govt which has extracted at least rs 43,500 crore due to non-maintenance of minimum balance from savings accounts & jan dhan accounts combined”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119731372,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-28992,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
