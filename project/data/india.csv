The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has called upon Muslims nationwide to don black armbands during Alvida Juma, Ramzan's final Friday, opposing the Waqf Amendment Bill 2024 .AIMPLB in a post on X, said, ""It is the responsibility of every Muslim in the country to strongly oppose this bill (Waqf Amendment Bill 2025). The All India Muslim Personal Law Board appeals to all Muslims to wear a black armband while coming to the mosque on Jumu'atul Wida as a silent and peaceful expression of grief and protest.""The letter further said that the Waqf Amendment Bill 2025 was ""a sinister conspiracy aimed at depriving Muslims of their mosques, eidgahs, madrasas, dargahs, khanqahs, graveyards, and charitable institutions.""It also noted that, ""the strong protests by Muslims at Jantar Mantar in Delhi and Dharna Sthal in Patna have at least caused a stir among BJP's allied parties.

During the assembly session, Tamil Nadu's Chief Minister said that the bill discriminates against Muslims.""The central government is inserting schemes that are against state rights, culture, and tradition. In India, various cultures, traditions, and languages are present, but they are doing it with the intention of taking revenge on the states. The Waqf (Amendment) bill is against Muslims,"" CM Stalin said in the assembly.The 1995 Waqf Act, which governs Waqf properties, has faced criticism regarding property mismanagement, corruption, and unauthorised occupations.The proposed amendments introduce a series of changes designed to modernise the Waqf system. Among the key provisions are stricter regulations governing the registration and monitoring of Waqf properties.","The all india muslim personal law board (aimplb) has called upon muslims nationwide to don black armbands during alvida juma, ramzan's final friday, opposing the waqf amendment bill 2024.

It demanded that LS send the bill to the JPC for scrutiny.Congress’ Manish Tewari and other MPs alleged the bill lacked the balance between law and fundamental rights. They accused Modi govt of invoking infiltration of Bangladeshis and Rohingyas during polls, but doing nothing during 11 years in office to address the situation.

Tewari said the bill’s provisions give “arbitrary powers” to govt to decide exemption categories, and slammed the clause that makes the immigration officer’s decision final.Sudhakar Singh (RJD), Rajeev Rai (SP), NK Premachandran (RSP), Saugata Ray (TMC), Raja Ram Singh (CPI-ML) Malwinder Kang (AAP), Manoj Kumar (Cong), K Radhakrishnan (CPM), IUML, Francis George (Kerala Congress) criticised the bill.","The opposition voiced serious concerns that stringent provisions in the immigration and foreigners bill would be misused by bjp government.

A day after a parliamentary panel said that non-allocation of funds to states that have not signed MoUs to implement the PM SHRI scheme is unfair, central govt sources defended the move, emphasising the need for uniformity in school education standards across the country.“If 33 states and UTs have already implemented the scheme, then the remaining must reconsider,” a senior govt official said. “The PM SHRI scheme is key to ensuring nationwide equivalence in curriculum and assessment. These schools will serve as exemplars in terms of quality, modern infrastructure, and innovative teaching methods,” the official added.The PM SHRI (Prime Minister Schools for Rising India) scheme aims to upgrade over 14,500 schools with modern classrooms, smart learning tools and skill-based education aligned with National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.Govt sources expressed frustration over the refusal of some states to sign the MoU despite repeated appeals. “Central govt has written multiple times at several levels, urging these states to reconsider their decision for the sake of their students. Yet, despite repeated appeals, some govts have not signed. They should not deny their students the opportunity to learn in modernised, better-equipped schools,” Govt sources said.The source further stated, “This is not just a matter of policy — it’s a matter of basic fairness.

Otherwise, all these would be in private hands and commercially exploited. It will lead to the rich getting better amenities and the poor nothing,” a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said.The SC was also against selling state assets to fund development projects. “Selling assets to generate funds is not a solution. The political executive has a better understanding of the issues than us. So, they must take policy decisions in this regard,” the bench said. The court was hearing a dispute relating to 38 acres of prime land situated between Hyderabad and Secunderabad, which was purchased in 1964 by Kalyan Nagar Cooperative Society for construction of houses for its members. However, the land came to be encroached, and the society could never take possession of it.After hearing additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati for the Telangana govt, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy for the civic body and senior advocate Guru Krishna Kumar for the society, the bench found that most of the encroachers were slum-dwellers who had moved out after transferring their land to other people who had now built multi-storied houses there.The SC laid out the options to be weighed by the state: compensation to be paid by the authorities to society members at present market rate and recovery of the amount from the encroachers as regularisation and development fee; find alternative parcels of land for allotment to the society and to the encroachers and use the vacated land for commercial use or other projects that would get investment for the state.“Decision on this issue will require detailed deliberations on the suggested options.

The area has been cordoned off and reinforcements deployed.According to official sources, the slain policemen includes a head constable and two constables. The bodies were yet to be evacuated from the site as the operation continues.Grenades and rocket fire rocked the area with multiple explosions. “The gunfire continued throughout the day,” an official said late at night, adding that the wounded security personnel were taken to Kathua and Jammu hospitals, where they are reported to be in stable condition.The attackers are believed to be the same group that managed to escape after a brief gunfight Sunday evening near Sanyal village in Hiranagar sector, close to the Pakistan border. Sufain’s forests are about 35km from Sanyal village.The security forces had closed in on the terrorists hiding in a remote, mountain hut — one of many built by nomadic herders who roam the area with their livestock.

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over the erosion of family values, with children and parents litigating in court over maintenance and ownership of property, the Supreme Court on Thursday said that the country was on the brink of following a 'one person, one family' concept. It also held that parents could be allowed to evict children from their self-acquired property only if it was necessary to ensure their (parents) protection.""In India, we believe in Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam i.e. the earth, as a whole, is one family. However, today we are not even able to retain unity in the immediate family... The very concept of 'family' is being eroded and we are on the brink of 'one person, one family',"" a bench of Justices Pankaj Mithal and S N Bhatti said while adjudicating a property dispute between a man and his parents who had sought his eviction from their house.The court said Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act does not talk about eviction but it could be done if it was necessary and expedient to ensure protection of senior citizens. The court set aside an order of an appellate tribunal under the Act which had directed eviction of a man from the premises of his parent's house as sought by them. SC noted that the man was taking care of his parents and was providing them maintenance and there was no need to remove him from the house.","India is on the brink of following a 'one person, one family' concept, supreme court says.

Resolution against Waqf Amendment Bill



'Clever political move'



NEW DELHI: Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu are nearly a year away, but it seems chief minister MK Stalin has already managed to set the agenda for the polls by latching on to some of the key issues raised by the BJP When Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan asked the DMK government in Tamil Nadu to implement the three-language policy, MK Stalin turned it into an issue of state's rights alleging that it was not the National Education Policy that the BJP was trying to implement but a ""saffron policy"" aimed at developing Hindi and not the nation.Raising fears of ""Hindi imposition"" on the state, Stalin claimed that Tamil Nadu was ready for another language war.The Tamil Nadu chief minister did not stop at that. He simultaneously raised the pitch on the ""threat"" of Tamil Nadu losing Lok Sabha seats under the proposed delimitation and called an all-party meeting on the issue to ensure that the state was not penalised for ensuring development and controlling population.""In the name of delimitation, a sword is hanging over southern states. Tamil Nadu succeeded in population control through the family planning programme. Just because population is less, there is a situation of the Lok Sabha seats being cut down (in TN). We stand to lose 8 seats and as a result, we would be having only 31 MPs, and not the 39 (present number). Our representation (in Parliament) will reduce, Tamil Nadu's voice is being stifled. This is a mater of Tamil Nadu's rights. All leaders and political parties should jointly speak across party lines on the issue,"" Stalin said raising the pitch.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi, I have an appeal! Try to develop India rather than Hindi. Sanskrit cannot be developed even if you spend thousands of crores. You will spend crores to develop a language that is not spoken by the people. Will you betray our Tamil language that is recognised in several countries and spoken by the people?"" he added.With the three-language policy an emotive issue in the state, even Stalin's political opponents were forced to attend his meeting.The Tamil Nadu chief minister later took the lead in mobilising other southern states and chaired a meeting on the issue of delimitation and its fallout on these states.Stalin followed up his language and delimitation offensive by raising the pitch against the Centre's Waqf Amendment Bill. The Tamil Nadu assembly passed a resolution against the proposed Waqf Bill in the assembly and insisted that the Union government recall the Bill as it would badly affect the minority Muslims.Piloting the resolution, Stalin said the bill is ""destroying the rights of Muslims. This is against the freedom of religion. This is hurting Muslim sentiments."" The Tamil Nadu CM further claimed the Bill was an assault on the constitutional rights of minorities and their institutions.While the BJP walked out, all other parties including the principal opposition AIADMK and NDA partner the PMK supported the resolution.""All parties in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly have unanimously passed a resolution opposing the Waqf (Amendment) Bill to be brought by the Union BJP government! The BJP is working with the aim of crippling the functioning of the Waqf organisation by making several amendments at once, without any demand from Muslims,"" Stalin wrote on X.Senior journalist and political analyst Vijaya Sankar says chief minister Stalin has played a smart political game in the run up to the assembly elections next year.""It was a clever move on the part of the DMK chief. Instead of making it a party issue, Stalin made the language and delimitation issues a question of Tamil Nadu's pride and ensured the backing of even his political opponents,"" he says.""The resolution against the Waqf Bill in the state assembly will help the ruling DMK consolidate the Muslims who constitute around 12% of population,"" says Vijaya Sankar.The BJP and the AIADMK have accused Stalin of orchestrating ""political drama."" Their attacks notwithstanding, the fact is that Stalin has managed to set the narrative and has forced his political opponents to back him on these issues.One look at Stalin's response to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath's attacks on language row and it sums up how Tamil Nadu chief minister has tried to turn the controversy over these issues into an advantage for his party.""Tamil Nadu's fair and firm voice on #TwoLanguagePolicy and #FairDelimitation is echoing nationwide--and the BJP is clearly rattled. Just watch their leaders' interviews. And now Hon'ble Yogi Adityanath wants to lecture us on hate? Spare us. This isn't irony--it's political black comedy at its darkest. We don't oppose any language; we oppose imposition and chauvinism. This isn't riot-for-votes politics. This is a battle for dignity and justice,"" Stalin posted on X.Stalin may now try to keep these issues alive as the state approaches next year’s assembly elections.","Tamil nadu chief minister mk stalin has already managed to set the agenda for the polls. He raised fears of ""hindi imposition"" on the state, claimed that tamil nadu was ready for another language war.

'BJP will not come into power in West Bengal in 100 years'

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah , while replying in the Lok Sabha on the Immigration and Foreigners Bill , 2025, on Thursday accused Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government of obstructing border security efforts by not providing land for fencing and showing mercy to infiltrators.He said, ""The fencing work of 450 km is pending because the West Bengal government is not giving land for it... Whenever the process of fencing is done, the ruling party workers indulge in hooliganism and religious sloganeering. The fencing work of 450 km of border has not been completed because the West Bengal government is showing mercy to the infiltrators.""Shah further accused the TMC government of aiding illegal immigrants by providing them with identity documents. ""Whether Bangladeshi infiltrators or Rohingyas, earlier they used to enter India through Assam when Congress was in power. Now they enter India through West Bengal where TMC is in power,"" he stated. ""Who issues them Aadhaar cards, citizenship?... All the Bangladeshis who have been caught have Aadhaar cards from 24 Parganas district. You (TMC) issue Aadhaar cards and they come to Delhi with voter cards... In 2026, the BJP government will be formed in West Bengal and we will put an end to this.""He also drew attention to the need for stricter immigration laws to safeguard national security and monitor foreign arrivals.Highlighting India's growing economic stature and the increasing influx of foreigners, Shah said, ""In the last ten years, India has become the fifth-largest economy. India has emerged as a bright spot among the world's largest economies. India has become a hub of manufacturing, and it is natural for people from all over the world to come to India.""However, he warned that infiltration for ulterior motives has also increased. ""The number of people taking refuge in India for personal gain and making the country unsafe has also increased... Be it Rohingyas or Bangladeshis, if they come to India to create unrest, strict action will be taken against them.""Defending the Immigration and Foreigners Bill, Shah said it was necessary for national security. ""Immigration is not an isolated issue. For the security of India, we must know who is entering our country, for how long, and for what reasons."" He added that the bill would introduce a structured system to monitor foreigners. ""With the Immigration and Foreigners Bill, we will establish a detailed and structured system to track every foreigner entering the country. This will help us develop the nation and monitor those coming for business. It will also allow us to keep a sharp eye on individuals who may pose a threat to our security.""Focusing on India's historical role in providing refuge, Shah said, ""India is a geo-cultural nation, not a geo-political nation. Persians came to India and are safe in the country today. The world's smallest minority community is safe only in India. Jews fled from Israel and stayed in India. During Prime Minister Modi's tenure, people from six oppressed communities from neighboring countries are taking refuge in the country through CAA.""Shah also made it clear that national security would remain a top priority. ""Those who pose a threat to national security will not be allowed to enter the nation. The nation is not a 'Dharamshala'... If someone comes to the nation to contribute to its development, they are always welcome.""Responding to Amit Shah's accusations against Mamata Banerjee, TMC MP Saugata Roy dismissed the claims as baseless. ""All the allegations of Union home minister Amit Shah are false,"" he said. Roy further criticized the central government for delays in installing border fencing, stating, ""They can't blame us for that.""

Opposition stages walkout in Rajya Sabha

NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party (SP) MP Ramji Lal Suman , who is currently facing backlash for his remarks on Rajput ruler Rana Sanga , refused to backdown on his comments saying, ""there is nothing to apologise for.""In an interview with PTI, Suman said that ""people should develop a habit of listening to the right things"" and firmly declared, ""I will not apologise in this life.""Suman's remarks, captured on video, described Rana Sanga as a ""traitor"" who invited Mughal emperor Babur to defeat Ibrahim Lodi.Defending his remarks, he said, ""It is a historical fact that Rana Sanga brought Babur to defeat Ibrahim Lodhi. They had an understanding that Babur would attack Ibrahim Lodhi, and Rana Sanga would attack Agra. Rana Sanga did not keep his part of the deal.""""Later, Babur and Rana Sanga fought against each other in Fatehpur Sikri, and Rana Sanga fought with great bravery but lost the battle. This is a fact,"" he added.The SP MP also cited historical sources, including ""Baburnama"" and Jawaharlal Nehru’s ""Discovery of India,"" to support his claim.""There is a big historian Puniyani, Baburnama, and as far as I remember, Jawaharlal Nehru has mentioned it in Discovery of India too... As I said, this is historic and I am ready to confirm it,"" he told PTI.The remarks led to a violent backlash. On Wednesday, a mob reportedly linked to Karni Sena vandalised Suman’s residence near Hari Parvat Chauraha, damaging parked cars and breaking glass windows. Videos showed a small number of police officers attempting to control the situation as the attackers rampaged. One policeman was injured during the violence.Suman alleged that the attack was a direct threat to his family. ""They broke all the glass windows, destroyed the cars in the colony, and their intent was to harm my family. I had already informed the Rajya Sabha Chairman about threats being made against me since March 22 through social media,"" he said, adding that the attackers even arrived with a bulldozer.Also read: 'Just a trailer,' says Karni Sena leader on vandalising Samajwadi MP's house over Rana Sanga remark Following the incident, Agra police registered an FIR against an ""unknown mob"" under charges including rioting, attempted murder, house trespass, and robbery, as per ANI. SP leader Ramgopal Yadav, who visited Suman, claimed the attack was pre-planned and accused the administration of inaction despite prior warnings. ""The attackers came with bulldozers, sticks, and swords, yet they were not stopped. This suggests they had government backing,"" Yadav alleged.The political fallout intensified, with SP, Congress, and other opposition parties staging a walkout in the Rajya Sabha to protest the attack. They demanded a discussion on the matter, but Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar declined to suspend the day’s proceedings. Opposition leaders criticised the BJP government for failing to prevent the violence.SP chief Akhilesh Yadav accused Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath of complicity. ""Ramji Lal Suman is a Dalit MP with vast experience. His house was attacked while the Chief Minister was in the same district. This could not have happened without his consent,"" he claimed. He also criticised the BJP for allegedly distorting history for political gain.","Samajwadi party (sp) mp ramji lal suman is facing backlash for his remarks on rajput ruler rana sanga.

NEW DELHI: Nearly five years after the death of celebrity manager Disha Salian, her father, Satish Salian, has moved the Bombay high court seeking a fresh investigation into the case.Satish Salian recently lodged a written complaint with the Mumbai Police Commissioner, requesting the registration of an FIR against Aaditya Thackeray and others accused of offences including gang rape and murder.According to his advocate, Nilesh Ojha, the complaint has been accepted by the Joint Commissioner of Police. The accused named in the case include former Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray, ex-Mumbai Police Commissioner Parambir Singh, former officer Sachin Vaze, and actor Aditya Pancholi.Speaking to ANI on Thursday, Satish Salian claimed he had initially been misled into believing that his daughter had died by suicide. He also alleged that former Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar had visited him at his residence.""Kishori Pednekar had come to my home and told me that the media was spreading incorrect information about my daughter, which was not good. She said they were there to put an end to it. I was told this was a suicide and nothing else. The police assured me they had her phone call records, details of places she visited, and the people she met. I was misled into believing there was no foul play,"" he said.Earlier this week, Salian visited the office of the Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) in South Mumbai, accompanied by his lawyer, days after filing a petition in the Bombay high court. The petition alleges that ""Disha was raped and murdered, and there was a politically orchestrated cover-up to protect certain influential persons.""Disha Salian died on June 8, 2020, after falling from the 14th floor of a residential building in Malad, just six days before actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead in his Bandra apartment.This development follows reports that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has submitted a closure report on Rajput’s death case.","Disha salian's father has moved the bombay high court seeking a fresh investigation.
