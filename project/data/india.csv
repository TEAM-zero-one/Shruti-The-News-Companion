Those opposing the law are doing so due to political reasons or because they are unaware of its purpose. They will eventually regret their stance and come round when they see positive outcomes,” he said.“After the launch of the portal all waqf properties across the country will be registered on this centralised platform.I am going to appeal to state govts and state waqf boards to register and upload details of properties as a first step towards proper management. We want that the over 9 lakh waqf properties are managed and used properly. Accountability, efficiency and transparency are the core principles defining the process,” he added.Significantly, only waqf properties, including those in the ‘waqf by user’ category, existing prior to Waqf Amendment Act 2025’s coming into force on April 8 that are registered with state waqf boards as per norms laid out in the 1995 Act will be able to upload their information on the Central Portal. The officials at the ministry of minority affairs said asserting that this will help weed out the possibility of bogus entries into the database.For existing waqf properties, the status has to be uploaded within six months of the portal’s launch. For new properties seeking waqf status, the process laid out under the new law will apply.For uploading details on the portal, the mutawalli (caretaker) will serve as the ‘maker’, entering property details, including registration document details. A Waqf Board official will function as the ‘checker’, reviewing and validating entries. Finally, a designated ‘govt authority’ will act as the ‘approver’, ensuring full verification before records are finalised.",Minority affairs minister kiren rijiju has stressed that the portal in no way violates the law or the constitution.

PUNE: IMD indicated on Thursday a potential revival of southwest monsoon between June 12 and 18, following a stall since May 29.An IMD official said a system may form over Bay of Bengal on June 12-13, though uncertainties persist due to conflicting model outputs. ""Some models suggest a system formation, others do not. We are not confident enough to include it in our forecast yet,"" the official said.The extended-range forecast, however, points to a monsoon revival during the specified period, irrespective of whether a system forms or not. Post-revival, the IMD anticipates robust rainfall across central India, parts of Maharashtra and south peninsular India (parts where monsoon has already advanced).The forecast brings hope to regions grappling with dry spells as monsoon's progress has been sluggish over the past week. The IMD official said: ""The monsoon's advance across other regions post-revival will hinge on rainfall distribution and establishment of monsoon winds.""An extended range forecast by IMD indicated that southwest monsoon was likely to advance over some more parts of central and east during the week June 12 to 18.For the same week, it said fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy falls were likely over many parts of south Peninsular and adjoining central India due to the strengthening of westerly winds and likely development of an off-shore trough off the west coast.Overall rainfall activity was likely to be above normal over south peninsular India; normal to above normal over many parts of central India and below normal over northwest, east and northeast India from June 12-18, the IMD extended range forecast stated.Private forecaster Skymet Weather Services, however, expressed greater confidence in the formation of a monsoon system over Bay of Bengal.""A precursor cyclonic circulation is expected to develop over the west-central Bay of Bengal by June 10. It will take another 48 hours for reorganisation and consolidation,"" Skymet president G P Sharma said. According to Sharma, the system is likely to trigger weather activity along the coastline from June 11. ""The weather system may track slightly south of its usual path, moving across Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Maharashtra. "" Skymet predicted the monsoon revival window to span from June 12 to 17, covering most of south peninsular India.","Imd indicates potential revival of southwest monsoon between june 12 and 18.

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over misuse of Sec 498A of IPC that criminalises cruelty in matrimonial homes and dowry harassment, Supreme Court has quashed a case lodged 23 years ago by a Delhi Police woman sub-inspector against her husband, a colleague, and his entire family.Allowing the husband's appeal and quashing the case, a bench of justices B V Nagarathna and Satish C Sharma exercised SC's exclusive powers under Art 142 of the Con-stitution to quash the FIR lodged in 2002 at Malviya Nagar in Delhi and the charge sheet filed against the policeman, his parents and five sisters.""It is rather unfortunate that the complainant being an officer of the state has initiated criminal machinery in such a manner, where the aged parents-in-law, five sisters and one tailor have been arrayed as accused,"" it said.Writing the judgment, Justice Sharma said: ""Even if the allegations and the case of the prosecution is taken at face value, apart from the bald allegations without any specifics of time, date or place, there is no incriminating material found by the prosecution or rather produced by the complainant to substantiate the ingredients of 'cruelty' under Section 498A IPC."" The court said there were genuine cases of dowry harassment and cruelty in matrimonial homes but flagged the ""growing tendency to misuse legal provisions"" by women to rope in relatives of their husbands.The man and woman, both sub-inspectors in Delhi Police, had got married in Feb 1998 as per Buddhist rites. Alleging persistent torture for more dowry ever since the solemnisation of marriage, the woman lodged a police complaint in July 2002. A chargesheet was filed against the man and his relatives in July 2004. The magistrate had framed charges in June 2008.","Supreme court has quashed a case lodged 23 years ago by a delhi police woman sub-inspector against her husband, a colleague, and his entire family.

Census to pave way for nationwide delimitation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/census-to-pave-way-for-nationwide-delimitation/articleshow/121660013.cms,"Entire Census 2027 data may be released in 3 yrs

NEW DELHI: Population data returned by the upcoming 'Census 2027', due to begin on April 1, 2026, will pave the way for a countrywide delimitation of Lok Sabha and assembly constituencies, as the March 1, 2027 reference date makes it ""the first Census to be held after 2026"".However, the chances of delimitation being completed in time for the 2029 general election appear bleak, given that the final population data may take time to be published. The final population data for Census 2011 was published almost two years after release of the provisional data in March-end 2011. Even with a 'digital' Census - which is expected to facilitate early release of tables - there may be a considerable time lag between completion of the exercise in March 2027 and availability of the final population count to enable initiation of the delimitation process.The home ministry on Thursday took to X to explain the delay in conducting the Census, put on hold five years ago due to the Covid outbreak, stating that hiring lakhs of school teachers as enumerators would have immensely disrupted primary education already hit by the pandemic.The home ministry also cited issues in quality and coverage of Census conducted by other countries immediately after the Covid-19 pandemic.The Census declared by govt on Wednesday fulfils the criterion laid down in the 84th constitutional amendment for a fresh countrywide delimitation.“The relevant cutoff here is the March 1, 2027 reference date for the upcoming Census. Population enumeration is to be done in Feb 2027, and the population count — the primary input for the next delimitation — will be recorded as on March 1, 2027. Thus, the criterion of the upcoming Census being the first Census after 2026 is fulfilled,” said former chief election commissioner (CEC) N Gopalaswami, who was also ex officio member of the last Delimitation Commission chaired by Justice Kuldip Singh. Jay Vinayak Ojha from Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy added, “Article 82 of the Constitution provides for readjustment of seats between and within states after each Census. The 42nd amendment, passed in 1976, had provided that readjustment of constituencies would take place based on the figures of the first Census to be taken after the year 2000.Delimitation takes time — a couple of years, at least, though the 2002 one had taken six years — as it involves consultations with MPs, MLAs, state chief electoral officers, as well as public meetings in all states/Union Territories to record suggestions and hear objections and claims. Sources indicated that the entire Census 2027 data may be released in around three years; the population figures, much earlier. Interestingly, Finalising delimitation prior to the 2034 general election will work well in terms of plans to switch to ‘one nation-one election’ system, and the implementation of one-third reservation for women in legislature.","Census 2027 will pave the way for a countrywide delimitation of lok sabha and assembly constituencies.

1st passenger train to Srinagar on Saturday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1st-passenger-train-to-srinagar-on-saturday/articleshow/121659886.cms,"LUCKNOW: Neetu Sapra has bittersweet memories of the 14 years she spent in J&K since 1997.""No quarters, peak insurgency, Kargil War - it was a roller coaster,"" she says of life in a CRPF camp in Srinagar with a two-year-old son and a railway officer husband handling a project as fraught with danger as it was technically daunting. ""On a shopping trip to Lal Chowk in 1998, we narrowly escaped a bomb blast. The USBRL shaped us as much as we shaped it.""Neetu's story is intertwined with the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link (USBRL) that PM Narendra Modi is set to inaugurate Friday, marking the physical bridging of what was once considered a geographical implausibility: seamless rail connectivity from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.""Wives of all railway personnel associated with USBRL would have similar stories to tell,"" says Neetu, whose husband Suresh Kumar Sapra was then an executive engineer with Northern Railway.Sapra was posted in Udhampur when former PM H D Deve Gowda laid USBRL's foundation stone in Udhampur in early 1997. Many thought the task of carving a route through the undulating, terrorist-infested terrain was a fanciful idea.By April that year, India had a new PM in I K Gujral, and a second foundation ceremony was soon planned in Srinagar for the Qazigund-Baramulla section.Sapra recalls receiving an official note from his senior colleague Sandeep Gupta - the executive engineer assigned to lead the 13-strong technical team - to proceed to Srinagar for the July 12, 1997, event.With the odds as steep as the Pir Panjal, the team got cracking. ""Srinagar was synonymous with militancy. Nobody was prepared,"" Gupta, who retired as USBRL's chief administrative officer in Feb this year, writes in the 2009 TOI coffee table book, 'Linking Paradise: A Northern Railway Project'.""We had no choice but to dive in. This was bigger than us,"" he writes in the book, remembering how his team got by erratic phone and electricity connections and an inadequate number of vehicles.Sapra's trip to Srinagar from Udhampur to lay the ground for the foundation ceremony prepared him for what lay ahead.""Just 13km beyond Udhampur, we dodged the possibility of death by a few metres as a landslide occurred in front of our eyes. The national highway was blocked for 48 hours."" A week later, Gupta joined them, reaching Srinagar on a rickety van. A team from CRPF's 69th battalion was then occupying the railway-owned holiday home in Srinagar's Tulsi Bagh, leaving Gupta's team to cram into four dingy rooms within the complex.""We had only candles for light and hauled water in buckets from CRPF tankers,"" says Sapra, currently principal executive director in the Research Design and Standards Organisation in Lucknow.Living conditions and logistics remained a challenge throughout. The state power department refused to restore electricity to the railway facility, citing unpaid bills throughout a decade of unrest. It took several meetings with the then divisional commissioner of Kashmir, SL Bhat, for power supply to be restored. Mudassara, the PA to DoT's then general manager, intervened to provide landlines.On Nov 12, 1997, a railway survey team comprising two officers, three junior engineers and six helpers reached Nowgam (later named Srinagar railway station) on a cloudy, uneasy morning. Locals mistook them for a police raid party, causing an already tense situation to almost spiral out of control.""I had butterflies in my stomach due to sheer anxiety and fear,"" Gupta recalls in his essay.Every day, a road-opening party would set out ahead of the railway survey team to detect and defuse potential mines. After spending weeks studying topography sheets and working out other details, Gupta and Sapra drove the first two wooden pegs into the ground to mark the project's first alignment.""It felt like we had planted a dream,"" recalls Sapra.As winter took hold, the survey covered Pampore and Kakapora. The first snowfall of 1997 came on Nov 27. Work had to be halted by Dec 15. The team would return next April to resume work.""On our off days, we hunted for vegetarian food in Srinagar. However, the CRPF wasn't happy about our venturing out of the railways complex,"" reminisces Gupta.While surveying Anantnag, the team would run into surrendered militants still carrying AK-47s. ""They looked intimidating, but didn't do us harm; in fact, they seemed encouraging,"" says Gupta.By Oct 31, 1998, the Qazigund-Baramulla survey report was ready. The railway team didn't just beat the odds; they completed the task ahead of schedule.After the Baramulla-Qazigund section, Sapra and his colleagues were asked to survey the proposed Katra-Qazigund stretch. That was in 2001. The then rail minister Nitish Kumar laid the foundation for this portion two years later.""During the survey, we closely observed how difficult life was for people of the Valley. Pregnant women, critically ill patients and elderly people would be brought down from hilly terrain on makeshift palanquins as there were no roads. Mules and horses were the only modes of transport to ferry goods,"" recalls Sapra.Just when things seemed to be going well, tragedy struck on June 25, 2004, when IRCON engineer R N Pundhir and his brother were kidnapped and killed by terrorists at Sugan in Shopian. ""It was a jolt. Work paused. But buoyed by local sympathy and police support, the railway men restarted with the same zeal,"" writes Bhanu Prakash, the then deputy chief engineer of USBRL, in his memoir.The first trial run in Oct 2008, from Budgam to Kakapora, was a milestone in more ways than one. A Hindu priest, a Muslim cleric and a Sikh granthi presided over prayers before the train rolled in at 30kmph. ""Locals lined the tracks and children skipped school to see the trial run. Even the cattle seemed puzzled!"" recounts Bhanu.By the time the Qazigund-Baramulla section was commissioned in 2009, tracks were ready for trains to run at speeds of up to 100kmph.Built at a cost of around Rs 44,000 crore, including a parallel highway, the 272km rail route has 36 tunnels and 943 bridges, including the world's highest, the Chenab Bridge.The rail route promises all-weather connectivity, slashing the 800km Delhi-Srinagar journey to under 13 hours.This isn't just a story of steel tracks, concrete arches and staggering statistics. USBRL is an odyssey of workers and officials fighting the elements, braving the threat of guns, and enduring separation from their families to finally ""connect"" Kashmir to the rest of India.","Neetu sapra's story is intertwined with the udhampur-srinagar-baramulla rail link (usbrl) pm narendra modi is set to inaugurate the link on friday. ""no quarters, peak insurgency, kargil war - it was a roller coaster,"" she says.
