KANPUR: Nine bank managers, three crop insurance staffers, and 32 farmers - 14 of them landless - have been booked after Rs 68 lakh was fraudulently transferred to 35 ""landless"" farmers as compensation for crop losses in Uttar Pradesh's Farrukhabad district in violation of Prime Minister's Crop Insurance Scheme (PMCIS) rules.Deputy director (agriculture) filed two FIRs. The case pertains to the 2024 rabi season, during which HDFC Ergo had insured crops of 8,849 farmers. When the crops were damaged, the insurance company paid claims worth Rs 2.28 crore to 232 farmers.This included payments of Rs 4 lakh each to several landless farmers. District magistrate Ashutosh Kumar Dwivedi ordered a probe into the landholdings of farmers who received insurance compensation above Rs 1 lakh. The subsequent probe conducted by the naib tehsildar, kanungo, and ADO (agriculture) revealed the 35 farmers did not own any land at the locations mentioned in the insurance claim records.In Balipatti Rani gram panchayat in Amritpur tehsil, out of 15 farmers who received crop insurance claims, 14 had no land. These 14 farmers were paid Rs 24.89 lakh.

Road ministry to do away with arbitration for disputes in NH sector which are for over Rs 10cr,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/road-min-to-do-away-with-arbitration-for-disputes-in-nh-sector-which-are-over-10cr/articleshow/126241885.cms,"NEW DELHI: Seeking to end alleged malpractices in high-value arbitration cases, including concerns over undue influence to obtain favourable rulings, the road transport ministry will do away with the provision of arbitration for disputes in the highway sector which are over Rs 10 crore.As per the finalised changes in contract norms, disputes valuing more than Rs 10 crore will be dealt only through conciliation or mediation. In case of no resolution, parties can take the matter to civil courts. The new norm would be applicable for all types of contracts - Build-Operate-Toll-Transfer (BOT-Toll), Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM) and Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC).The changes in the contract conditions are being made based on a study of arbitration practices in the past 10-15 years. People familiar with the issue said that between 2015 and 2025, there were nearly 2,600 arbitration awards in the highways sector where contractors had raised disputes of around Re 90,000 crore and the arbitration award was little over Rs 30,000 crore in these cases. In addition, highway builders have made claims of another Rs 1 lakh crore through arbitrations.The finance ministry in June 2024 had issued guidelines stating that arbitration as a method of dispute resolution should not be routinely or automatically included in procurement contracts and tenders, especially in large contracts.""As a norm, arbitration (if included in contracts) may be restricted to disputes with a value less than Rs 10 crore.

‘We Will Win In The End’: Kuldeep Sengar’s Daughter Speaks After SC order On Unnao Rape Sentence

'Public servant'

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday stayed a week-old Delhi high court order granting bail to former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, convicted of raping a minor in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao, during pendency of his appeal against conviction and ensured that he is not released from prison.Departing from the general practice of the apex court not interfering with HC orders granting bail, a bench of CJI Surya Kant, and Justices J K Maheshwari and A G Masih said the case against Sengar and the way the HC granted him bail raises several questions of law requiring deeper consideration.""Keeping in mind these peculiar circumstances, we deem it appropriate to stay the operation of the impugned order dated Dec 23 passed by HC. Consequently, the respondent (Sengar) shall not be released from custody..."" the bench said.One of the issues raised by CBI through solicitor general Tushar Mehta was that the HC failed to appreciate that Sengar, a public servant being an MLA, was in a dominant position and hence his offence of raping a minor girl must be construed as an aggravated form of sexual assault under IPC and Pocso Act Such an act under Pocso warrants stringent punishment, which under IPC shall not be less than 10 years imprisonment and could extend up to the entire natural life of the convict.When Sengar's counsels, senior advocates N Hariharan and Sidharth Dave, questioned the CBI contention about Sengar being a public servant, CJI Kant-led bench said, ""We are worried that if the proposition advanced by the convict is accepted then a patwari will be considered a public servant but not MPs and MLAs."" The bench sought Sengar's response to CBI's appeal and posted the matter for further consideration on Jan 20.Mehta said, ""A person may not be a 'public servant' for the purpose of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, but may still be a 'public servant' within the meaning of the Pocso Act if he is in such a dominant position as contemplated in other categories of Section 5.""""Considering the intent, object and purpose of the POCSO Act, an elected representative who wields enormous power and is in a position of dominance over children will have to be treated as a 'public servant' for the purposes of the Act, particularly when the Respondent Accused (Sengar) was an MLA of the same constituency where the victim/survivor resided,"" he said.""We are conscious of the fact that ordinarily when a convict/under-trial has been released on bail pursuant to an order passed by the trial court or the high court, such order shall not be stayed by this Court without hearing such person,"" the SC bench said. ""However, the instant matter revolves around certain unique facts and circumstances, wherein the respondent-convict is also separately convicted and sentenced in a case under Section 304 Part II of the IPC and is consequently still in custody. We are informed that in such proceedings also, the respondent-convict has applied for bail, and after hearing the arguments, the order is said to have been reserved by the concerned court.""The bench said the rape survivor had a statutory right to file a separate appeal against the HC order and required no SC permission. ""In case she needs any free legal aid, the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee is directed to provide such services to her. However, she may, if so advised, file her appeal through counsel of her own choice,"" it said.Hariharan pointed out innuendoes being hurled at the judges of HC bench which granted bail to Sengar and said some allegations going viral on social media were contemptuous. Mehta said the judges in HC division bench were among the finest in the country with unimpeachable integrity and condemned the personal attack unleashed against them.""There are always some elements who attempt to browbeat honest judges. Such devious forces must not be encouraged. The opinion of party (CBI) which lost before the bench of these two honest and brilliant judges must put an end to this controversy generated by some unscrupulous vested interests,"" he said.The bench agreed and said it is not uncommon that even the most brilliant and honest judges commit an error. ""These two HC judges are among the finest. But we (judges) are all prone to committing errors,"" CJI Kant said.","The supreme court stayed a week-old delhi high court order granting bail to former bjp mla kuldeep singh sengar, convicted of raping a minor in uttar pradesh's unnao. A bench of cji surya kant, and justices j k maheshwari and a g masih said the case raises several questions of law requiring deeper consideration.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126241865,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-991575,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Elderly deaths, distress reported amid SIR hearings across Bengal

KOLKATA: An 82-year-old jumped on the railway tracks hours before his scheduled appearance at a hearing for the special intensive revision of electoral rolls at Para in Bengal's Purulia Monday. A septuagenarian from Howrah and another from Kalyani died after receiving SIR hearing notices. Family members of both blamed SIR stress for the deaths.As SIR hearings entered the third day, reports poured in of anxiety gripping ""unmapped"" voters being asked to appear before EC officials.A 96-year-old man in Cooch Behar, a 90-year-old woman in Katwa and a pregnant homemaker from Taki were among thousands who waited in queues for hearings. EC clarified that, on request, BLOs would visit homes of voters aged 85 and above, and those with disabilities and ailments.TNNDurjan Majhi, 82, jumped onto the railway tracks and was run over by a train at 8.30am, around 5 hours before he was to appear in an SIR hearing at the Para BDO office. His only son Kanai, who works as a day labourer, said, ""My father had submitted the SIR enumeration form but his name was not on the draft voters' list.His name was on the 2002 voters' list, though. We don't understand why he was called to a hearing. He had been anxious since getting the hearing notice on Dec 25. ""Jamat Ali, 75, passed away at his home in Howrah's Amta Sunday night, hours after receiving a hearing notice. Howrah DM P Deepap Priya said, ""He was already unwell. His kin claimed he was anxious about the hearing. An inquiry is underway.""In Kalyani, Jaharlal Mahato (72) died of cardiac arrest on Monday, 48 hours after he attended an SIR hearing.

He could barely walk because of his age and physical ailments. ""I am the only one in my family to get the SIR notice. My name was not on the 2002 list. I gave them whatever documents I had,"" Sarkar said, visibly frustrated.At Katwa I BDO office, one of the people in the queue was a 90-year-old bedridden woman, Muktibala Paramanik, whose house is 4km from the hearing venue. Grandson Paritosh Paramanik said, ""This is just harassment. They asked her to sign some documents and let her go.""East Burdwan DM Ayesha Rani said, ""We did not get any written instruction that hearings for elderly people should be conducted at home.

SRINAGAR: Kashmir’s apple orchards — the backbone of the Valley’s rural economy — are under renewed scrutiny as lawmakers and medical experts raise concerns over a possible link between decades of pesticide use and rising cases of malignant brain tumours among orchard workers.The concerns were raised by the House Committee on Environment of the Jammu and Kashmir assembly, chaired by CPM legislator MY Tarigami, which met officials, scientists and health experts to examine the health hazards faced by those working in apple orchards.“For years, farmers have sprayed orchards unaware of the toxicity of constant pesticide exposure, leading to a rise in malignant brain tumors among those who power the valley’s billion-rupee apple economy and contribute more than 70% of India’s total apples,” the committee said.The discussion revisited findings from a study conducted by the Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), which examined more than 400 cancer patients between 2005 and 2008.The study reported high incidences of primary brain cancer in districts forming Kashmir’s core fruit belt, including Baramulla, Anantnag , Budgam, Shopian and Kupwara. It identified a “quite strong and possible” link between pesticide exposure and malignant brain tumours among orchard farmers.The findings were largely ignored when first published but have resurfaced amid growing medical evidence of pesticide-linked health disorders in the Valley.Tarigami told TOI, “We don’t want to create panic among farmers who spray their orchards every season. But neither can we sit idle when data indicates a serious health hazard. If pesticide spray is harming lives, it must be addressed.”Scientists told the committee that pesticide use in apple orchards often exceeds recommended limits.Shahid Rasool, principal scientist at CSIR–Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, said many orchardists spray chemicals every 10 to 12 days instead of the advised 18 to 21, believing it boosts yield.“Few can afford protective gear; chronic cough, rashes and irritation are common. Without gloves, goggles and masks, the risk multiplies,” he warned.Rasool said orchardists now use as many as 15 rounds of fungicide and insecticide each season, far beyond recommended schedules, and called for safer practices and protective equipment.Further concerns were raised by Dr Sobia Nisar, a physician-researcher at Government Medical College, Srinagar, who has studied the biochemical effects of pesticide exposure among residents of apple-growing districts such as Shopian and Pulwama.“The initial idea was to check pesticides residue levels in the fruit,” she said. “But what we found was far more disturbing. Traces of these compounds in human blood samples.”Her findings document pesticide residues in the bloodstream of orchard workers and nearby residents, along with higher rates of obesity, lipid disorders, metabolic syndrome and early kidney impairment.“When such patterns emerge consistently across populations exposed to pesticides, it demands urgent scientific scrutiny,” Dr Nisar said.A study published in the Indian Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine reported that 90% of brain tumour patients from Kashmir’s orchard belts had been exposed to pesticides, with all cases involving high-grade, aggressive tumours.The research focused on orchard workers in districts such as Anantnag, Budgam and Baramulla — areas that account for over 90% of the Valley’s apple-growing land — with smaller districts like Shopian and Kulgam also showing significant concentrations of cases.The House Committee on Environment said it would recommend measures to the health and horticulture departments focusing on monitoring, research funding and worker safety, as concerns grow over the long-term health impact of pesticide use in Kashmir’s apple orchards.A detailed study titled “Pesticides and brain cancer linked in orchard farmers of Kashmir”, conducted by researchers at the Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), examined the relationship between pesticide exposure and primary malignant brain tumours among orchard workers in the Valley.The study analysed medical records of 432 patients diagnosed with primary malignant brain tumours and 457 control patients with non-tumour neurological conditions, all treated at SKIMS over a four-year period between 2005 and 2008.These patients had been exposed to multiple neurotoxic and carcinogenic chemicals, including chlorpyriphos, dimethoate, mancozeb and captan.Only 9.96% of patients had no recorded exposure to pesticides. Among the control group, 119 out of 457 patients had a history of pesticide exposure, while 338 had no such link.Of the pesticide-exposed cancer patients, 71.7% were male and 28.3% were female, including members of three families. Nearly a third — 31.9% — were younger than 40 years, having begun exposure at an early age.The study found that all orchard-related patients had high-grade, aggressive brain tumours, unlike those in the non-pesticide-exposed group. Mortality among pesticide-exposed tumour patients was recorded at 12%.Researchers measured serum cholinesterase levels — a marker used to assess exposure to organophosphate pesticides — and found higher-than-normal levels in 31.9% of exposed patients, while decreased levels were seen in 45.3%.Statistical analysis showed a significant case-control odds ratio of 0.28, with additional hospital and family control serum cholinesterase odds ratios of 1.1 and 1.5 respectively, pointing to what the study described as a strong suspicion of a link between pesticide exposure and brain cancer.The study noted that millions of tonnes of pesticides, insecticides and fungicides are sprayed annually across Kashmir’s orchards. Apple cultivation alone covers more than half of the Valley’s fruit-growing land, with around 40% of the population directly or indirectly exposed through farming, residence near orchards or recreational use of orchard spaces.Researchers highlighted that prolonged use of synthetic pesticides over the past three decades has coincided with a marked rise in admissions of high-grade malignant brain tumours from orchard districts to SKIMS.The study concluded that occupational and environmental exposure to pesticides in Kashmir’s fruit-growing regions poses a serious health risk, warranting closer monitoring and further investigation.","Lawmakers raise concerns over possible link between decades of pesticide use and rising cases of malignant brain tumours among orchard workers.

Cracks in MVA?

How the feud began

What the split led to

NEW DELHI: Are the senior and junior Pawars on the same side again? For the upcoming civic polls, the answer is yes. The Ajit Pawar-led NCP has announced that it will contest the Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune local body elections together with the NCP ( Sharad Pawar faction).Announcing the tie-up, Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said the alliance is restricted to the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) elections, stressing that it is a local arrangement.“For the sake of the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation elections, the ‘clock’ and the ‘tutari’ (trumpet) have united. The parivar has come together,” deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said while announcing the alliance.""We are the ones who work for development. We will edge out those who tried to put this municipal corporation in debt,"" he added.Claiming the upcoming polls to be the ""fight of the workers"", NCP(SP) MLA Rohit Pawar said that the decision was taken listening to the views of party workers.""After speaking with all the party workers, Supriya Sule herself also interacted with the workers from Pune. Subsequently, discussions were held with workers from Pimpri-Chinchwad.This is a fight of the workers and their election. Therefore, after listening to their views and understanding their concerns, it was decided that both NCP factions will contest the polls together in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. However, both parties will contest on their respective symbols. "" NCP (SP) MLA Rohit Pawar said.""This decision has been taken only for Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, and that too after listening to the local workers and with their consent. Pawar Saheb is not involved in this entire decision-making process. Such senior leaders have never directly participated in municipal corporation elections. He only said that the views of those who fought for us should be heard and understood, and that decisions should be taken in accordance with what the workers decide. Therefore, this alliance has been formed in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad,"" he added.Meanwhile, the announcement also brought ripples in the Mahaviakas Aghadi Dal alliance partners seeking answers from Sharad Pawar.""This issue is limited to Pimpri-Chinchwad. As far as I think, they will not be in an alliance in Pune. Sharad Pawar needs to answer this, as he has always opposed the BJP, but now they are going with them. Pawar Saheb and Amit Shah need to respond to this,"" Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut said during a media briefing.Earlier, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Shirsat also hinted that there is a possibility of NCP (SP) joining the BJP-led NDA government.“Both the NCPs are coming together by forming an alliance for the upcoming municipal corporation elections,” he said, adding that such local-level adjustments could be a precursor to a broader political understanding.This comes two years after Ajit Pawar, along with a group of senior leaders, parted ways with his uncle Sharad Pawar and joined hands with BJP and Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. He had raised objection over Sharad Pawar continuing to lead the party, despite old age.Ajit was sworn in as deputy chief minister under this new alliance. He favoured aligning with the ruling coalition, while Sharad Pawar's faction insisted on remaining with the opposition.The Election Commission later recognised Ajit's faction as the legitimate NCP, retaining the ‘clock' symbol. Meanwhile, Sharad Pawar's faction (NCP-SP) adopted the ‘tutari' (curved trumpet) symbol.Both factions contested elections separately. After the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, where his faction faced setbacks, Ajit Pawar acknowledged that turning his back on family had been a “mistake”.Ajit had justified his decision by saying that he joined hands with NDA to ""ensure stability and progress in Maharashtra.""""We are in alliance with the BJP and Shiv Sena, and many people ask me why I took the step of separating from the (undivided) NCP and why I accepted the strain on family and personal relationships. I want to tell you that I did this not for power or position, but to ensure stability and progress in Maharashtra.""""In other parties, leaders retire after an age. In the BJP, leaders retire at 75, when are you going to stop? You should also give new people a chance. If we make mistakes, tell us. Your age is 83, will you ever stop or not? You give us blessings,"" he added.In the Maharashtra assembly elections in 2024, Ajit Pawar’s NCP upped its score from a mere six Assembly segment leads in the Lok Sabha results to a tally of 41 MLAs, in the process beating the senior Pawar’s nominees in 27 head-to-head clashes; the latter won seven of those contests.The 2024 Maharashtra assembly elections saw the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance win 235 seats, including 132 for the BJP, 57 for the Shiv Sena, and 41 for the NCP (Ajit Pawar faction). The Maha Vikas Aghadi was reduced to 20 seats for Shiv Sena (UBT), 16 for the Congress, and 10 for the NCP (Sharad Pawar faction).",Ajit pawar-led ncp will contest the pimpri-chinchwad and pune local body elections together with the ncp ( sharad pawar faction) both parties will contest on their respective symbols.

The 'public servant' interpretation



Why it matters



Survivor welcomes SC intervention



(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday stepped in to stay the Delhi high court order that suspended the former BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar’s life sentence in the 2017 Unnao rape case. On the Central Investigation Bureau's plea challenging the HC order, Supreme Court bench flagged serious legal concerns over the interpretation of the law and the implications it could have for accountability of elected representatives.A three-judge vacation bench led by Chief Justice Surya Kant, along with Justices JK Maheshwari and Augustine George Masih, stayed the execution of the high court’s December 23 order that had suspended Sengar’s life sentence under the POCSO Act Supreme Court made it clear that Sengar would not be released from jail, noting that he continues to remain in custody in another case related to the custodial death of the rape survivor’s father.While acknowledging that sentence suspensions are not usually stayed without hearing the convict, the bench said the ""peculiar facts"" of the case warranted immediate intervention.""Issue notice. We have heard solicitor general Tushar Mehta for CBI and senior advocate for the convict... Counter will be filed in four weeks. We are conscious of the fact that when a convict or an undertrial has been released, such orders are not ordinarily stayed by this court without hearing such persons.But in view of peculiar facts where the convict is convicted for a separate offence, we stay the operation of the Delhi high court order dated December 23, and thus the respondent shall not be released pursuant to the said order,"" the bench ordered.At the heart of the CBI plea is whether an MLA can be treated as a ""public servant"" for the purpose of aggravated offences under the POCSO Act.Appearing for the CBI, solicitor general Tushar Mehta argued that Sengar, who was a powerful MLA at the time of the crime, exercised dominance over the minor survivor and squarely fell within the scope of aggravated sexual assault under the law.Sengar’s counsel, senior advocates Siddharth Dave and N Hariharan, countered this by arguing that an MLA could not automatically be treated as a public servant under POCSO.The Supreme Court, however, expressed unease with the high court’s reasoning, warning that such an interpretation could lead to lawmakers being exempted from stricter punishment.""We are worried that a constable or patwari will be a public servant under the Act, but an MLA or MP will not be and get exempted,"" the bench observed.Section 5 of the POCSO Act treats sexual assault as ""aggravated"" if committed by a public servant or a person in a position of authority, attracting a minimum punishment of 20 years that can extend to life imprisonment.In 2019, a Delhi trial court had held that Sengar qualified as a public servant and sentenced him to imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life. The high court’s suspension of that sentence had triggered sharp criticism, with the CBI arguing that it diluted the intent of the law.The Supreme Court has now issued notice to Sengar and will examine whether the high court erred in excluding legislators from the definition of ""public servant"" under POCSO Act.Meanwhile, the Unnao rape survivor welcomed the Supreme Court’s order, saying she had full faith in the justice system and felt reassured by the apex court’s intervention.""I am very happy. I had faith in the Supreme Court. I will ensure that he is given a death sentence,"" she said speaking to the reporters.The survivor's mother has asked for security for her family and advocate saying, ""My family needs security. Our advocates need security. I request that the government keep us all safe.""","The supreme court on monday stepped in to stay the delhi high court order that suspended the former bjp leader kuldeep singh sengar’s life sentence in the 2017 unnao rape case.

NEW DELHI: Ishita Sengar, daughter of former BJP MLA and Unnao rape case convict Kuldeep Singh Sengar, penned an open letter on Monday saying that she is “exhausted, frightened and slowly losing faith”.Her statement came after the Supreme Court stayed a Delhi high court order that had suspended her father’s life sentence.In her letter, Ishita wrote: “I am writing this letter as a daughter who is exhausted, frightened, and slowly losing faith, but still holding on to hope because there is nowhere else left to go.”The Supreme Court stayed the operation of the December 23 Delhi high court order and directed that Kuldeep Singh Sengar shall not be released from prison in connection with the 2017 Unnao rape case.A three-judge vacation bench comprising Chief Justice of India Surya Kant and Justices JK Maheshwari and AG Masih passed the order while hearing a plea filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The bench observed that although courts usually do not stay bail orders once a convict is released, the present case involved “peculiar facts” as Sengar remains in jail in another criminal case.“We are conscious of the fact that when a convict or an undertrial has been released, such orders are not ordinarily stayed by this court.But in view of the peculiar facts where the convict is convicted for a separate offence, we stay the operation of the Delhi High Court order,” the bench said.Also read: 'Will ensure Kuldeep Sengar is given death sentence- Unnao rape survivor hails SC decision; what she said Kuldeep Singh Sengar, an expelled BJP MLA from Unnao, was sentenced to life imprisonment in December 2019 for the rape of a minor under the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. He is also serving a separate 10-year sentence in a CBI case related to the custodial death of the rape survivor’s father.In her letter addressed to the “Hon’ble Authorities of the Republic of India,” Ishita Sengar said her family had waited silently for eight years, trusting the legal system.Explaining why the family chose not to protest publicly, she wrote: “We chose silence not because we were powerful, but because we believed in institutions. We waited because we believed that truth does not need spectacle.”She alleged that despite being labelled “powerful” because of her father’s political identity, her family remained unheard.“People call us ‘powerful.’ I ask you what kind of power leaves a family voiceless for eight years?” she said. Ishita added that her family had been “drained financially, emotionally, and physically” while seeking justice.Also read: SC stays Delhi HC order granting bail to Kuldeep Sengar; ex-BJP MLA to remain in jail Ishita also claimed she had received rape and death threats on social media over the years, which eventually silenced her.“Over these years, I have been told countless times that I should be raped, killed, or punished simply for existing,” she wrote, describing the abuse as “daily” and “relentless.”She further expressed concern that fear and public outrage were beginning to overshadow facts and due process.“If pressure and public frenzy begin to overshadow evidence and due process, what protection does an ordinary citizen truly have?” she asked.Clarifying her intent, Ishita said the letter was not written to seek sympathy or special treatment.“We are not asking for a favour. We are asking for justice because we are human,” she wrote, urging that the law be allowed to function “without fear” and evidence be examined “without pressure.”During the Supreme Court hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, described the case as a “very horrific” instance of child rape and argued that Sengar, being an MLA at the time, occupied a dominant position over the victim, attracting stricter punishment under the POCSO Act.The bench also expressed concern that excluding lawmakers from the definition of “public servant” under POCSO could create legal immunity for MPs and MLAs.Meanwhile, the rape survivor’s mother welcomed the Supreme Court’s order, saying it gave her hope that her daughter would finally get justice.The Supreme Court has issued notice to Sengar and sought his response within four weeks. The matter is scheduled to be heard again in the last week of January.Following the apex court’s decision, Kuldeep's daughter Aishwarya Sengar alleged that her family was not given an opportunity to present its arguments on the merits of the case and claimed that key facts were being overlooked.“We couldn’t even start arguing on the merits of the case today, that she has changed her statement several times, changed the timing thrice, starting from 2 pm, 6 pm and then finally 8 pm. There’s a finding of the AIIMS medical board that she was more than 18. I’ve been fighting for justice for the past eight years, but maybe the sorrows of me and my family mean nothing.

"On the roof of the world, feral dogs hunt down Ladakh’s rare species",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ladkah-on-the-roof-of-the-world-feral-dogs-hunt-down-ladakhs-rare-species/articleshow/126218554.cms,"Lean, feral dogs move with predatory intensity across a snow-dusted desert, Ladakh's stark peaks looming behind.

SRINAGAR: It’s bloody murder on the roof of the world.A new predator has quietly grown to dangerous numbers. Feral dogs roam the cold desert of Ladakh, preying, often in packs, on endangered wildlife and attacking people. Conservationists warn that they outnumber native predators in the region.What began as a byproduct of increased tourism, military deployment, and unmanaged waste in the cold desert moonscape of Ladakh has grown into a full-blown crisis. And it’s manmade.Scientists and wildlife officials warn that these free-ranging canines — estimated by the WCBCL at nearly 45,000, far in excess of what the region’s ecology can sustain — are preying on some of Ladakh’s rarest high-altitude species. They threaten snow leopards, wolves and foxes, and prey on rare species like Pallas’s cat, the Eurasian lynx, Tibetan gazelle, blue sheep, ibex, and Himalayan marmots, said Lobzang Visuddha, chairman of the Wildlife Conservation and Birds Club of Ladakh (WCBCL), a community-based voluntary initiative by young people.The killing of a Pallas’s cat, one of the rarest and least-studied species, by feral dogs in Anley last year has alarmed conservationists like Visuddha. “In fact, there are records of killing two Pallas’s cats and Eurasian lynxes by feral dogs,” he saidThe dogs also threaten ground-nesting birds, with packs frequently chasing black-necked cranes, the UT’s state bird, and attacking ruddy shelduck chicks when they move from rocky nesting sites to nearby water bodies, Visuddha said.Advocate Tashi Gyalson, who headed the local government in Leh as chairman of the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council from Nov 2020 to Nov 2025, said the issue hasn't been arisen all of a sudden. “We have to admit that this situation has actually been created by humans over a long period of time,” he said.Gyalson said these dogs have been part of the ecosystem and community but rapid urbanisation meant they lost their use as hunting dogs, shepherd dogs, watchdogs and companion animals. “This, multiplied by the abundant carrying capacity of the environment, caused their rapid multiplication, and eventually caused the current situation,” he said.Experts say the worst hit is eastern Ladakh, the region with the highest concentration of wildlife, where poor waste management are subsidising the dog population.“The main concern is the availability of excess kitchen waste in areas occupied by the Army and areas where there is tourism,” Gyalson said.The stretch from Kargyan Chibra to Tsokar, in eastern Ladakh, has become a hotspot for feral dog activity due to unsustainable waste “Feral dogs are by far the most serious threat as far as the wildlife of Ladakh is concerned. I have myself seen how stray dogs in Hanle and Tso Moriri actually raided the nests of the black-necked crane, and preyed upon the eggs and young ones,” said Intesar Suhail, who was wildlife warden of Ladakh in 2013-14.“I have even seen them chasing animals as big as the Tibetan wild ass. The active ground nests of waterbirds, particularly the black-necked crane and bar-headed goose, are more vulnerable as they are located in marshy areas, surrounded by shallow waters easily accessible to dogs,” he said.A strong sense of smell and pack behaviour give feral dogs a lethal advantage over wildlife that evolved without such human-introduced predators, Visuddha said.“Though these species face natural threats in the wild, feral dogs are not one of them, they are a problem introduced by humans,” said the WCBCL founder.Ladakh has also reported at least five fatal attacks on humans, mostly on women and children, by feral dogs, which was unheard of in the region until recently, he said.Phuntsog Wangail, president of the Chamba Animal Welfare Society, which runs Ladakh’s largest animal care facility, said Ladakh was facing growing fears of long-term ecological imbalance due to feral dogs.They survive largely on food waste from tourist camps, hotels, roadside dhabas and temporary settlements. When these facilities close or relocate, particularly during winter, the canines are left without reliable food sources and begin roaming over long distances.“This seasonal movement pushes dogs into wildlife habitats, increases territorial conflicts, and accelerates breeding, placing Ladakh’s fragile ecosystem under severe pressure,” Wangail said.Visuddha said the feral dog threat to wildlife of Ladakh was next only to human activity.The rapid infrastructure expansion, including road building, power lines and mobile towers, has already fragmented habitats, while the expansion of camps, resorts, guest houses and hotels has intensified pressure on wildlife, he said.In winter, when tourism grinds to a halt and food becomes scarce, the dogs roam extensively, leading to a rise in dog-bite cases, road accidents and formation of aggressive packs. “At the same time, winter offers the best window for sterilisation, as dogs tend to remain closer to human settlements.”Data from the Animal Husbandry Department in Leh shows that 32,887 dogs were sterilised between 2015 and 2024, yet officials and conservationists say the population remains dangerously high.Wangial said Ladakh should carry out mass sterilisation over the next two years, with a special focus on female dogs and puppies, while calling for strict enforcement of animal welfare laws, including heavy penalties for dog dislocation, abandonment and cruelty.He called for the replication of successful models from the Netherlands and Bhutan, where mass sterilisation, strict enforcement of animal welfare laws and strong community participation have led to significant reductions in stray populations.While Visuddha said govt appears unconcerned about the issue, Gyalson offered a contrasting view. He said that after Ladakh became a Union Territory in 2019, a mission-mode campaign was launched to control the dog population. “The impact of the programme is visible as there are far fewer street puppies, especially in Leh city,” he said.However, Gyalson said several challenges continue to hinder effective population control, including Ladakh’s vast and rugged terrain, extreme climate, dispersed dog population, difficulties in capturing animals, and the absence of an accurate census.","Scientists and wildlife officials warn that these free-ranging canines are preying on some of ladakh’s rarest high-altitude species. They threaten snow leopards, wolves and foxes, and prey on rare species like pallas's cat.

'Regrettable': Uttarakhand CM speaks to Anjel's father



NEW DELHI: Father of Anjel Chakma, the Tripura student who died in a fatal racial attack in Dehradun, made serious allegations against the authorities saying that they refused to file an FIR after the assault dismissing it as ""minor matter"".""They wanted to file an FIR, but they were refused, being told it was a minor matter... Only when we went there did they finally register the case,"" Anjel's father Tarun Prasad Chakma said.""Our children from the Northeast go to various places like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru to work or study, they should not be treated so adversely. We are all Indians as well. I request the government to ensure equal treatment to all,"" he added.Anjel was assaulted on December 9 in Dehradun’s Selaqui area while he was purchasing groceries with his younger brother.Tarun recalled meeting his children after the attack in the hospital. ""I saw my child in a critical condition; his left arm and leg were paralysed because he had been stabbed twice in the back. Blood was gushing from his head,"" he said.He said that the case was registered only when he reached Dehradun.""I went to the police to report the incident, and they reviewed the CCTV footage from the scene. It showed that three people on a motorcycle approached my younger son, spoke to him briefly, and then started making comments,"" he said.Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami spoke to Anjel's father Tarun and assured strict punishment to the culprits.""This was a regrettable incident. We will ensure the culprits receive the harshest punishment,"" ANI quoted Dhami saying.""We are with you in this hour of need. We'll provide whatever help we can,"" he added.According to a police complaint, Anjel and his brother Michael Chakma (21) were stopped by a group of six men who allegedly abused them with racial slurs, including “Chinki,” “Chinese,” and “Momo.”The case was registered on December 12, based on Michael Chakma’s complaint, under provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita relating to voluntarily causing hurt, the use of dangerous weapons, and criminal intimidation. On December 14, after doctors assessed the gravity of the injuries, police invoked additional charges of attempted murder and criminal conspiracy.Five of the six accused, including two juveniles, were arrested on December 14, while the prime accused, Yagya Awasthi, remains at large. Police said Awasthi is believed to have fled to Nepal. Officials said a police team has been dispatched to Nepal to track down the prime accused.","Tripura student anjel chakma died in a fatal racial attack in dehradun.

Supreme Court Halts Bail For Ex-BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar In Unnao Rape Case, Signals Tough Stand

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday noted that some individuals are attempting to gain ""political advantage"" after lawyers for expelled BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar claimed that allegations had been made against the Delhi high court judges who had suspended his life sentence in the Unnao rape case.""We understand it. We are not sitting in ivory towers. We understand that people are trying to take political advantage and there are people who are trying to take advantage,"" said CJI Surya Kant, who was heading a three-judge vacation bench.Senior advocate N Hariharan, representing Sengar, highlighted that certain individuals were making allegations against the high court judges who handled the case.He urged such persons to refrain from making statements or accusations against the judges, noting that a circulating video containing these allegations was a matter of concern.""They are doing that on national television,"" Hariharan said, as cited by PTI.Another lawyer representing Sengar said that photographs of the high court judges were also being circulated. The bench noted that such actions overlook the fact that Sengar was convicted by the judiciary itself.“Very frankly, these judges are one of the finest we have,” said the bench, also comprising Justices J K Maheshwari and Augustine George Masih, during the hearing.Later, when asked about the allegations against the judges, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, stated unequivocally that both the high court judges are ""brilliant judges with unimpeachable integrity,” adding that any attempt to malign them must be strongly condemned, as cited by PTI.The Supreme Court stayed a Delhi high court order that had suspended Kuldeep Singh Sengar’s life sentence and granted him bail in the 2017 Unnao rape case. The apex court also issued a notice to Sengar, directing him to respond within four weeks to the CBI’s plea challenging the high court order.The high court had suspended Sengar’s sentence pending the outcome of his appeal against the 2019 trial court verdict in the rape case. However, he will remain in jail, as he is also serving a 10-year sentence in the custodial death case of the victim’s father and has not been granted bail in that matter.The survivor on Monday vowed to pursue the death penalty for Sengar and welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision to stay the Delhi High Court’s suspension of his life sentence.""I am very happy. I had faith in the Supreme Court. I will ensure that he is given a death sentence,"" she said while speaking to reporters.The Unnao rape survivor, who was a minor in 2017, was allegedly abducted and sexually assaulted by Kuldeep Singh Sengar between June 11 and 20, and was later sold before being rescued from the Maakhi police station.","Supreme court halts bail for ex-bjp mla kuldeep sengar in unnao rape case, signals tough stand.

Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

Rail services hit

NEW DELHI: Dense fog blanketed Delhi and large parts of North India on Monday, triggering widespread disruption across air and rail networks, with hundreds of flights cancelled or delayed and trains running hours behind schedule, leaving passengers stranded and frustrated.At the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport, at least 128 flights — 64 departures and 64 arrivals — were cancelled, while eight flights were diverted due to low visibility conditions. Nearly 200 flights were delayed, with an average departure delay of around 24 minutes, according to flight-tracking website Flightradar24.Visibility at the airport dropped to as low as 50 metres, forcing operations to continue under CAT III conditions, an advanced landing system used during dense fog. Delhi's AQI also crossed 400 on Monday, hitting 'severe' category of air pollution.Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) said runway visibility was gradually improving but warned that departures and arrivals could remain affected.IndiGo cancelled 80 flights across its network due to bad weather, with around half of those cancellations at Delhi airport. Other affected airports included Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kochi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Amritsar, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Dehradun, Indore, Patna and Bhopal.While the airline did not explicitly disclose the number of cancellations in its advisory, it acknowledged that fog-related disruptions were likely to extend into the afternoon hours.“Fog continues to persist across Delhi and several airports in northern India. Visibility remains reduced and, as a result, flight movements are presently slower than normal,” IndiGo said in a post on X.The airline has been cancelling flights in significant numbers since the start of the fog season on December 10, following earlier large-scale disruptions caused by stricter pilot duty norms. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has designated December 10 to February 10 as the official fog window this winter, during which airlines must deploy CAT-IIIB-compliant aircraft and pilots trained for low-visibility operations.Airlines including IndiGo and Air India urged passengers to regularly check flight status and assured them that safety remained the top priority as operations continued to adjust to fluctuating weather conditions.Rail services were also hit hard. Several trains were delayed by hours at New Delhi and Hazrat Nizamuddin railway stations, prompting passenger complaints.Gagan, travelling to Kanpur, told ANI that his train was delayed by eight hours, while students expressed concern about missing meals, exams and connections due to prolonged delays.Taxi drivers at stations reported a sharp drop in business as late-arriving trains reduced passenger movement.The fog also raised safety concerns on roads, with commuters warning of increased accident risks due to poor visibility. Meanwhile, smog reduced visibility in parts of Mumbai, adding to travel woes.","Dense fog blanketed delhi and large parts of north india on monday, triggering widespread disruption across air and rail networks.
