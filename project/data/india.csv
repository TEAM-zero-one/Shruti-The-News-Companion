What explains inconsistencies in deciding bail pleas in recent past



NEW DELHI: Holding that delay in trial and long incarceration cannot be a “trump card” to get bail in UAPA offences and that a court cannot treat liberty of an accused as the sole criterion and societal security as peripheral, Supreme Court Monday rejected bail pleas of student activists Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam in the Delhi riots case but granted relief to other five co-accused — Gulfisha Fatima, Meeran Haider, Shifa-ur-Rehman, Mohd Saleem Khan and Shadab Ahmad.The case relates to protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act turning violent, leading to communal clashes during the visit of US President Trump in 2020.Khalid and Imam, who along with others have been in jail for over five years, may have to spend another year in prison as the bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and N V Anjaria said they can apply afresh after a year or after all protected witnesses have been examined, whichever is earlier.The bench cited “hierarchy of culpability” to say Khalid and Imam stood on a different footing than the others.Granting bail is the discretionary power of a court and the outcome of a bail plea largely depends on the approach of a bench and that perhaps explains inconsistency of Supreme Court’s in the recent past in deciding cases, particularly those related to serious offences under special acts like PMLA and UAPA which provide stringent bail conditions..In some cases, like those of former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and Tamil Nadu minister, Senthil Balaji, accused's constitutional right to speedy trial was given precedence over the seriousness of the alleged offence and bail was granted on the ground of long incarceration and delay in trial. In some others; for instance, Gurvinder Singh v State of Punjab, gravity of the offence has been the deciding factor, with SC expressly cautioning against the mechanical invocation of prolonged incarceration as a ground for bail in cases involving serious offences under special enactments.While dealing in UAPA case, a three judge bench had in 2021 held that Section 43D(5) of UAPA per se does not prevent constitutional courts to grant bail on grounds of violation of fundamental rights of accused.""Courts are expected to appreciate legislative policy against grant of bail but the rigours of such provisions will melt down where there is no likelihood of trial being completed within a reasonable time and the period of incarceration already undergone has exceeded a substantial part of the prescribed sentence,"" Justice Surya Kant, now the CJI, who penned the judgement for the bench said.Justice Kant had said such an approach would safeguard against the possibility of provisions like Section 43D (5) of UAPA being used as the sole metric for denial of bail or for wholesale breach of constitutional right to speedy trial.While rejecting bail plea of Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam, a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and N V Anjaria referred to 2021 judgement and said ""The same decision, however, does not indicate as laying down a mechanical rule under which the mere passage of time becomes determinative in every case arising under a special statute. The jurisprudence of this Court does not support a construction whereby delay simpliciter eclipses a statutory regime enacted by Parliament to address offences of a special category. ""It said the proper constitutional question, therefore, is not whether Article 21 (right to life and liberty) is superior to Section 43D (5) of UAPA dealing with the higher bail threshold. ""The proper question is how Article 21 is to be applied where Parliament has expressly conditioned the grant of bail in relation to offences alleged to implicate national security. The law does not contemplate an either-or approach. Nor does it contemplate an unstructured blending of statutory and constitutional considerations. What is required is disciplined judicial scrutiny that gives due regard to both"".While granting bail to an accused in 2024 who was under custody for four years and trial had not initiated, SC had said the ""the over-arching postulate of criminal jurisprudence that an accused is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty cannot be brushed aside lightly, howsoever stringent the penal law may be"".The court had said, ""If the State or any prosecuting agency including the court concerned has no wherewithal to provide or protect the fundamental right of an accused to have a speedy trial as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution then the State or any other prosecuting agency should not oppose the plea for bail on the ground that the crime committed is serious. Article 21 of the Constitution applies irrespective of the nature of the crime. ”In an important ruling, SC in 2024 held that the conventional idea ‘bail is the rule, jail is an exception’ should be applicable not only to IPC offences but also other offences for which special statutes have been enacted like UAPA if the conditions prescribed under that law are fulfilled.In cases of Khalid and Imam the court emphasised that they also contributed to the delay in trial.",Supreme court monday rejected bail pleas of student activists umar khalid and sharjeel imam in the delhi riots case.

"Fearless judges bedrock of judiciary, can’t be penalised for error of judgment: Supreme Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fearless-judges-bedrock-of-judiciary-cant-be-penalised-for-error-of-judgment-supreme-court/articleshow/126363824.cms,"Probes based on motivated complaints will hit functioning of trial judiciary : SC



NEW DELHI: Observing that a fearless judge is the bedrock of an independent judiciary, Supreme Court on Monday held that disciplinary proceedings can’t be initiated against a judge for an error of judgment on their part. It also expressed concern over frivolous complaints being filed against members of judiciary, which lead to trial court judges treading with trepidation with regard to bail matters.Coming to the rescue of a trial judge whose services were terminated by Madhya Pradesh high court for an error of judgment in grant of bail to an accused, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan said it is not the correctness of the verdict but the conduct of the judicial officer in question which is determinative. While HC must immediately intervene when an allegation against a judge is true “to weed out black sheep sullying the fair name of the judiciary”, it must also defend a judge facing false and anonymous complaints, the court said. “A fearless judge is the bedrock of an independent judiciary, as much as an independent judiciary itself is the foundation on which rule of law rests.”A judicial officer is tasked with the onerous duty of deciding cases.Invariably, one party to the case would lose and go back unhappy. Disgruntled elements amongst them, wanting to settle scores, may raise frivolous allegations. The trial judiciary also has tremendous work pressure and works under trying working conditions. Large number of cases are listed in a day and most of the judicial officers give their very best while discharging their duties,” Justice Viswanathan, who penned the judgment, said.The functioning of trial judiciary would be seriously impacted and fearless discharge of duties would become a casualty if inquiries are launched on ill-conceived or motivated complaints, the court said, pointing out that a wrong decision can be a bona fide error of judgment.“It should be ensured that only because an order is wrong or there is an error of judgment, without anything more, a judicial officer is not put through the ordeal of a disciplinary proceeding or a prosecution... When false allegations fly thick and fast, the judicial officers cannot react. Here is where the high court, which is vested with the supervisory control, has to exercise great caution and circumspection,” the bench said while quashing the HC order and directing that the judicial officer be reinstated with back wages.The court said there was no merit in the allegation against the judge and the integrity of a judge cannot be questioned merely because of an erroneous order. “It will be a dangerous proposition to hold that judgments and orders which do not refer expressly to statutory provisions are per se dishonest judgments.”Justice Pardiwala said that initiation of departmental proceedings on mere suspicion is one of the primary reasons trial court judges are reluctant to exercise their discretion for grant of bail, resulting in HCs and SC being flooded with bail pleas. “It should not happen that because of the lurking fear in the mind of a trial court judge, of some administrative action being taken, that even in a deserving case, well within the principles of law, bail is declined. .. Over a period of time, the trial court judges have exhibited tendency to shirk from their solemn judicial function and responsibility when it comes to exercising discretion in matters relating to bail,” he said.",Probes based on motivated complaints will hit functioning of trial judiciary: sc.

Mobin, who spent over 13 years in prison, was declared a juvenile in conflict with law, rendering his continued detention unlawful under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act.The order was passed by a division bench comprising justices Ravindra Maithani and Ashish Naithani.Mobin had been convicted of murder and robbery under sections 302 and 393 of IPC by the additional district and sessions judge in Roorkee on Feb 15, 2008. His conviction was later upheld by HC on March 20, 2013, with the Supreme Court dismissing his appeal for grant of innocence in Aug 2013.The case dated back to June 24, 2003, when Mobin and four others — Imran, Shaharwan, Mustakeem and Farman — intercepted two men travelling on a scooter near Kaliyar in Roorkee. One of the victims, Jaipal Singh, was killed, while the other, Mahendra Singh, sustained injuries and was robbed.During the course of trial, Mustakeem and Farman were declared juveniles, while the remaining three, including Mobin, were sentenced as adults.Several years after his conviction, Mobin filed an application from jail, stating that he too had been a minor on the date of the offence, requesting that his case be reconsidered in light of the applicable juvenile law. The HC received this communication on June 15, 2021, and subsequently sought a report from police to verify his age. However, the report failed to offer a conclusive determination.On Aug 19, 2025, the court directed its registrar (judicial) to conduct an independent inquiry into Mobin’s age at the time of the incident. The registrar submitted a detailed report based on school records, witness statements and official documents, confirming that Mobin’s date of birth was May 22, 1988 — a finding the court deemed credible and reliable.","Uttarakhand high court has ordered the release of a man who had been serving a life sentence in a 2003 murder case.

It asked Singhvi to take instruction within a week whether Telangana would prefer filing a suit under Article 131 of the Constitution making all three states — AP, Karnataka and Maharashtra — parties.AP through senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi, Jaideep Gupta and Balbir Singh told the court that the project had Telangana’s consent at the time of reorganisation of Andhra Pradesh. Rohatgi said the tender is for preparation of DPR for the irrigation project, which is meant to use only the excess flood water flowing through AP, which is the lower riparian state.Singhvi said there was no means to measure excess flood water and alleged that it was a guise to misappropriate around 200 tmc of water allocated to Telangana, which he said is in the process of building various barrages to utilise its share of 968 tmc water. “It is a huge emotive issue in Telangana as commissioning of the irrigation project would cut the state’s share of Godavari water,” he said.Gupta said, “What is an emotive issue? Can one state stop an irrigation project in another state which is a lower riparian one?

Bank Holidays January 2026: The new year 2026 has just begun and if your to-do list contains a bank visit, it’s a good idea to check when banks will be closed in January. A missed holiday can easily turn a routine bank visit into a wasted trip, especially in the first few days of the year when people are settling back into work and finances.Banks in India observe a mix of national and regional holidays, which means closure dates can differ from one state to another.Banks will remained closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Nagaland and Meghalaya on the occasion of New Year's Day and Gaan-Ngai.Banks will remain closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu in observance of New Year Celebrations and Mannam Jayanthi.Banks will remain closed in Uttar Pradesh for birthday of Hazrat Ali.Banks in West Bengal will remain closed in observance of birth day of Swami Vivekananda.Banks in Gujarat, Odisha, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh will be shut in on the occasion of Makar Sankranti and Magh Bihu.The states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh will remain closed for Uttarayana Punyakala, Pongal, Maghe Sankranti and Makara Sankranti.Banks in Tamil Nadu will be shut in observance of Thiruvalluvar Day.Banks in Tamil Nadu will remain closed due to Uzhavar Thirunal.Banks in Tripura, Odisha, West Bengal, will remain shut in observance of the birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed nationwide on the occasion of Republic day.Apart from these holidays, banks also remain closed on every second and fourth Saturday of the month.Knowing bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute delays. However, bank closure does not means that customers can not process their financial transactions during holidays. Even when branches are shut, online banking services, ATMs, mobile banking apps and UPI for fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions are available for customers.However, services that require a physical visit, such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances and issuing demand drafts, will not be available. To avoid inconvenience, account holders are advised to plan these activities in advance and make the most of digital banking options during closures.","Banks will remained closed in mizoram, tamil nadu, sikkim, manipur, arunachal pradesh, west bengal, nagaland and meghalaya on the occasion of new year's day and gaan-ngai.

Congress dismisses 'Rahul vs Priyanka'



The great Rahul paradox



Priyanka steps forward



Whispers within the chambers



What next?



NEW DELHI: The Congress move to appoint Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as chairperson of the candidate screening committee for the upcoming Assam elections has added to the murmurs of leadership debate within the grand old party, with the BJP-led NDA claiming internal conflict between the Gandhi siblings. Soon after Priyanka's elevation, which was announced on Sunday, the BJP claimed that the Congress was divided between camps of Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi . The Congress, as expected, strongly rejected these claims and slammed the BJP for spreading ""manufactured propaganda.""BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said, ""The Rahul vs Priyanka camp has been going on for a very long time in the Congress party. All the pressure was exerted by the Rahul camp. 'Remove Rahul, bring Priyanka' is happening in Congress. Now even their allies don't trust Rahul Gandhi. Their own leaders don't want him; instead, they want Priyanka Gandhi.""The Janata Dal (United) also reacted to Priyanka's appointment, claiming that Rahul Gandhi's frequent foreign trips had shifted responsibilities to her.""It is expected that legislative assembly elections will be held in five states. The Congress's internal matters are handled by a screening committee.Who will handle this work when Rahul Gandhi is abroad? The responsibility has fallen on Priyanka Gandhi. However, this is their internal matter,"" JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said.The Congress has formally dismissed the NDA's claims, insisting there is no Rahul vs Priyanka camp within the party.On Sunday, the party defended its decision to appoint AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as chairperson of the Assam screening committee, strongly criticising the BJP for attempting to ""propagate"" a false leadership contest narrative.The Congress asserted that this was not the first time Priyanka had been entrusted with such responsibilities, recalling that she had earlier served as an ex-officio member of the screening committee during the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections.Congress MP Tariq Anwar told IANS, ""Earlier, she was the general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh when assembly elections were held there. So we cannot say this is the first time. This is the second time she has been given charge of a state related to elections. She will use her political experience and capability in Assam. There is a strong possibility of a Congress comeback in Assam.""""Priyanka Gandhi has been serving as general secretary for the past five years. She has been given organisational responsibilities from time to time and has worked across the country. Therefore, the notion propagated by the BJP is incorrect,"" he added.Congress leader Udit Raj also defended Priyanka's appointment, citing her ""wide influence and experience"".Speaking to IANS, Raj said, ""She is our leader and has been made chairperson of the Assam screening committee. Her influence is quite wide. She will oversee elections and make selections. She already has experience, and that experience will increase further.""Rahul Gandhi's position within the Congress is currently stronger than it has been at any point since his resignation as party president in 2019. After years of refusing formal office while leading high-visibility foot marches such as the Bharat Jodo Yatra (2022–23) and the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in early 2024, the Lok Sabha election results that year altered the equation.The Congress's improved performance, winning 99 Lok Sabha seats and securing the Leader of the Opposition post, did something the party had struggled to achieve for a decade: it gave Rahul constitutional weight.That momentum, however, was not sustained.Since the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the NDA staged a strong comeback, winning assembly elections in Haryana, Maharashtra, Delhi and Bihar.Rahul Gandhi led campaigns raising the ‘vote chori' charge and spearheaded the Voter Adhikar Yatra in Bihar, hoping to replicate the gains of his earlier mass movements.The narrative failed to resonate electorally, and the Congress emerged as the weakest link in the Bihar opposition, winning only six of the state's 243 assembly seats.At the same time, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has unmistakably moved out of the occasional-campaigner role. Once deployed sparingly for high-voltage rallies, she is now a constant presence, both in Parliament and on the streets.During the Winter Session of Parliament, the first-time MP from Wayanad assumed a leading role for the party. With a smile, she was seen patiently attacking the Modi government during the Vande Mataram debate.The Wayanad MP also was at the forefront when the opposition parties staged a walkout from Lok Sabha to protest against the VB-G RAM G Bill.She led the march within the Parliament premises while holding a photograph of Mahatma Gandhi.Despite Rahul Gandhi's absence from Parliament, the Congress drew significant attention for its aggressive protests and Priyanka emerged as a prominent face of the party both inside and outside the House.At the end of the session, she also attended the customary tea meeting hosted by Speaker Om Birla and was seen chatting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leaders from across parties.Though there has been no formal resolution, several reports have quoted ""voices within the Congress"" urging a larger organisational role for Priyanka, including suggestions that she could serve as party president or national face.After Rahul's resignation as Congress chief, former MP Abhijit Mukherjee, son of former President Pranab Mukherjee, openly appealed for Priyanka to take over, saying she should heed the ""clarion call of lakhs of Congress workers"".Former Union minister and senior Congress leader Anil Shastri has also said Priyanka Gandhi would be the best person to lead the party.Over time, and following successive assembly election losses, these whispers have grown louder.In December, former Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim wrote to Sonia Gandhi questioning the current leadership and explicitly seeking a ""greater central role"" for Priyanka.MP Imran Masood has also pushed for her elevation, arguing, ""Make her the Prime Minister and see how she responds, just like Indira Gandhi did,"" signalling that she should be the party's main face and de facto leader.Internal conflict or not, the specific role given to Priyanka in Assam elections does give credence to talks of her eventual elevation within the party. It is an important move in a politically sensitive state which the Congress hopes to wrest from the BJP. The Congress would hope that Priyanka's greater involvement in the state elections will help to counter BJP's ‘double-engine government' campaign led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.With the Congress till now projecting Rahul Gandhi as its only face, any greater role for Priyanka cannot be dismissed as a routine organisational decision. The move comes amid wider discussions on leadership, strategy and the future direction of the opposition camp.The final verdict, however, will come from voters, and not from whispers or internal demands. In the 2021 assembly elections, the BJP won 60 seats with 33.6% vote share and the Congress got 29 seats with 30% vote share.What happens in Assam over the next few months, as the state prepares to elect a new government this year, may play a role in shaping the future of the Congress leadership and also the Gandhi siblings.",Congress dismisses 'rahul vs priyanka' claims.

Why SC rejected Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam bail?

What are the charges

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday rejected the bail pleas of Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam -- lodged in Tihar jail under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) linked to 2020 Delhi riots.The bench of justices Aravind Kumar and NV Anjaria said that prosecution material disclosed a prima facie case against Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam, thereby attracting the statutory bar to bail under Section 43D(5) of UAPA.The bench added that the Khaild and Imam can pray for bail after one year after the completion of examination of protected witnesses.Meanwhile, the top court granted bail to 5 other accused in the case, adding twelve strict conditions.All seven accused had challenged Delhi high court's order denying them bail on September 2.The top court said that not every accused involved in the case stands on same footing. It said that both Khalid and Imam had a ""formative role"" in the conspiracy .""Umar Khalid and Sharjeel stand on different footing and it can't be ignored in terms of parity and culpability. It becomes a court to examine bail pleas individually to see whether pre-trial liberty is attracted.Liberty is of foundational importance at the same time, the constitution does not conceive liberty in isolation,"" the top court said.""This court is satisfied that the prosecution material disclosed a prima facie allegation against the appellants Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam. The statutory threshold stands attracted qua these appellants. This stage of proceedings does not justify their enlargement on bail. Apart from death or destruction the provision encompasses acts that disrupt services and threaten the economy,"" it added.The court said that in prosecutions under the UAPA, delay in trial does not operate as a ""trump card"" which automatically displaces statutory safeguards.""The UAPA as a special statute represents a legislative judgment as to the conditions on which bail may be granted in pre-trial stage. Delay serves as a trigger for heightened judicial scrutiny. The discussion has been confined to delay and prolonged incarceration. UAPA offences are rarely confined to isolated acts. The statutory scheme reflects this understanding,"" it said.""Section 43D(5) of UAPA departs from general provisions for grant of bail. (But) it does not exclude judicial scrutiny or mandate denial of bail in default,"" it added.Meanwhile, during the hearing, the advocates who appeared for them mostly argued on the delay and the unlikelihood of the commencement of the trial. It was also stated to the court that they have been under custody for over five years in a case in which they are facing serious allegations of committing offences under the UAPA.The contentions were also made that there is no proof of violence that they instigated the riots, even after five years have passed.Khalid along with several others have been charged in connection to an alleged conspiracy behind the communal riots which took place in Delhi in February 2020.Khalid was arrested in September 2020, charging him under several sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act including terrorist activity and conspiracy.Additionally he was also charged under provisions of the Indian Penal Code including murder, rioting, sedition, conspiracy and promoting communal enmity.According to Delhi Police, 53 people died in the violence and more five hundred people were injured.On September 2, the Delhi high court denied bail to Imam, Khalid and seven others -- Mohd Saleem Khan, Shifa Ur Rehman, Athar Khan, Meeran Haider, Shadab Ahmed, Abdul Khalid Saifi and Gulfisha Fatima. On the same day, another high court bench rejected the bail plea of co-accused Tasleem Ahmed.In its order, the high court observed that, prima facie, the role attributed to Imam and Khalid in the alleged conspiracy was “grave”, noting that they had delivered inflammatory speeches along communal lines to “instigate mass mobilisation of members of the Muslim community”.","Sc rejects bail plea of umar khalid, sharjeel imam; grants bail to 5 others in delhi riots case.

Nitish Kumar's Hijab Shocker: BJP MP Giriraj Singh Defends Bihar CM's Act With 'Go To Hell' Remark

NEW DELHI: AIMIM leader Imtiaz Jaleel on Friday said he would ""cut off the hand of any individual who dares to touch Muslim women with ill intent,"" amid controversy over Bihar CM Nitish Kumar’s action of pulling down a hijab from a woman’s face.Addressing a rally in Maharashtra, Jaleel also took a veiled jibe at BJP , alleging that ""so-called secular parties"" often support goons and criminal elements but hesitate to stand with Muslims.""A minister from Uttar Pradesh had made an objectionable remark.

SC Rejects Bail Plea Of Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam; Grants Bail To 5 Others In Delhi Riots Case

What the court said

What the Supreme Court said:

The court observed that Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam stand on a “qualitatively different footing” compared to the other accused, both in terms of the prosecution’s case and the evidence on record.

The SC said their roles were “central” to the alleged offences.

The bench noted that although their incarceration has been long and continuous, it does not violate constitutional guarantees nor override the statutory bar on bail under the applicable law.

The Supreme Court held that the prosecution material discloses a prima facie case against Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam.

It said the statutory threshold for denying bail under the law stands attracted in their case.

At the present stage of the proceedings, the court ruled that they do not deserve to be released on bail.

Activists Gulfisha Fatima, Meeran Haider, Shifa Ur Rehman, Mohd. Saleem Khan, and Shadab Ahmad, however, were granted bail by the Supreme Court.

BJP Claims Rahul Gandhi Ties To ‘Anti-India’ Panel Over US Lawmakers' Umar Khalid Letter

The case so far

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday pronounced its verdict on Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and several others, rejecting their bail plea in the Delhi 2020 riots case.A bench comprising Justices Aravind Kumar and N.V. Anjaria rejected the bail pleas of Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam, saying that the two stand on different footing and it can't be ignored in terms of parity and culpabilty.""Khalid and Imam can pray for bail after one year,"" the SC added, saying that that terrorist act under UAPA is not confined to conventional warfare but includes all acts of attacking national integrity and sovereignity.The accused had challenged a Delhi High Court order refusing them bail in a case under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) linked to the alleged larger conspiracy behind the 2020 north-east Delhi riots.The SC however granted bail to Gulfisha Fatima, Meeran Haider, Shifa Ur Rehman, Mohd. Saleem Khan, and Shadab Ahmad.Counsel appearing for the accused had argued primarily on the prolonged incarceration of the petitioners and the uncertainty over the commencement of the trial. They had told the court that the accused have been in custody for more than five years despite facing serious charges under the UAPA, and contended that there was no evidence to show that they had instigated violence during the riots even after such a long period.Opposing the pleas, the Delhi Police had maintained that the alleged offences amounted to a deliberate attempt to destabilise the state. It argued that the violence was not the result of spontaneous protests but part of a well-planned “pan-India” conspiracy aimed at “regime change” and “economic strangulation”.The police further submitted that the conspiracy was allegedly timed to coincide with the official visit of the then US President to India, with the objective of attracting international media attention and globalising opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The CAA, it said, was deliberately chosen as a “radicalising catalyst” under the guise of “peaceful protest”.According to the prosecution, the “deep-rooted, premeditated and pre-planned conspiracy” allegedly orchestrated by the accused led to the deaths of 53 people and extensive damage to public property, resulting in the registration of 753 FIRs in Delhi alone. It also claimed that evidence on record indicated an attempt to replicate the conspiracy on a pan-India scale, citing, among other things, the use of various WhatsApp groups, including the Delhi Protest Support Group (DPSG) and the Jamia Awareness Campaign Team.The Delhi Police argued that delays in the trial were attributable to the accused themselves and submitted that, if they cooperated, the trial could be concluded within two years.On September 2, the Delhi High Court denied bail to Imam, Khalid and seven others — Mohd Saleem Khan, Shifa Ur Rehman, Athar Khan, Meeran Haider, Shadab Ahmed, Abdul Khalid Saifi and Gulfisha Fatima. On the same day, another high court bench rejected the bail plea of co-accused Tasleem Ahmed.In its order, the high court observed that, prima facie, the role attributed to Imam and Khalid in the alleged conspiracy was “grave”, noting that they had delivered inflammatory speeches along communal lines to “instigate mass mobilisation of members of the Muslim community”.","Supreme court rejects bail plea of umar khalid, sharjeel imam.

NEW DELHI: In a first, India will get a twin-tube underwater tunnel that will have provision for movement of both vehicle and trains, boosting faster movement of forces and ammunition in case of any exigency, reports Dipak Dash.An inter-ministerial panel, headed by the expenditure secretary has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across Brahmaputra river in Assam connecting Gohpur and Numaligarh. One of the tubes will have provision for a single rail track.As per design, there will be no vehicular movement when trains run through this tube. It will have ballistic track and the trains will run on electricity. The total project of 33.7km, including the tunnel, approach roads and railway track will cost around Rs 18,600 crore. Once the project is complete, travel time between Gohpur and Numaligarh will reduce from current six-and-half hours to just 30 minutes, shortening the distance from 240km to 34km. This will enhance connectivity to Arunachal, Manipur, and other northeastern states.The project cost will be borne by road transport, railways and defence ministry.Designed as two unidirectional tunnels with two lanes each, these will be built 32m below Brahmaputra's deepest bed level. The project is expected to be completed in five years after the award of work.Officials said the projects will be placed before Union cabinet for approval and this may happen before Assam assembly polls. Last year, finance ministry had green signalled a road tunnel costing around Rs 14,900 crore with provision of 80:20 funding by road transport ministry and defence ministry. But following a decision to build road-cum-railway tunnels where it's feasible, govt had identified three such tunnels for North-East chicken neck corridor, across Brahmaputra in Assam and on Maranahally-Addahole (Shiradi Ghat) stretch in Karnataka, which TOI first reported on Oct 6, 2025.Officials said because of provision of railway track in one tunnel the cost has gone up.","An inter-ministerial panel has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across brahmaputra river in assam.

A tiger appeared without warning, gliding like a shadow along the forest edge as a boat drifted through the Periyar waters. For a 13-year-old boy visiting Kerala in 1957, the moment was electrifying. Wildlife then was not something confined to sanctuaries; it was visible, immediate, woven into everyday landscapes. That fleeting encounter stayed with Romulus Whitaker long before he became one of India's most influential conservationists, shaping a life devoted to understanding-and defending-creatures most people feared.Whitaker's first journey to Kerala was part of a family trip. His sister was graduating from high school, and the itinerary included Kochi, where they stayed at the Malabar Hotel, then considered the city's finest. Boat rides through rivers like the Periyar were already popular, and wildlife sightings were common. ""Gaurs and deer were easily spotted, and tigers still roamed freely at a time when hunting was legal. I never saw a king cobra on that trip, but the habit of looking closely had already taken root,"" Whitaker recalls.That fascination had formed much earlier, far from India. Growing up in northern New York State, Whitaker once watched neighbourhood boys kill a snake out of fear.""I knew more about snakes than the other kids, and that made a difference,"" he says. His mother encouraged his curiosity, buying him a book on snakes that helped replace fear with knowledge. When he later brought a live snake home, she admired it rather than panicking, calling it beautiful. An old aquarium with cracked glass became a makeshift enclosure. Without realizing it, Whitaker had taken his first step into a lifelong engagement with reptiles-a fascination that deepened after his family moved to India in the 1950s.Janaki Lenin, Whitaker's partner and co-author of his autobiography ""Snakes, Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll: My Early Years"", says writing the book gave her a deeper understanding of the extraordinary life he has lived. His schooling, she notes, was anything but conventional-camping in forests, fishing in lakes, and once even discovering a python under his bed. Boredom was never an option. If a classroom failed to hold his attention, he simply walked away to explore something more compelling outdoors. Comparing his life to her own, Lenin describes Whitaker as someone who has ""lived six or seven lifetimes in one.""Formal education never quite suited him. After finishing school, Whitaker enrolled in college but soon realized classrooms could not compete with hands-on learning. His real education began at the Miami Serpentarium under Bill Haast, the legendary snake handler who pioneered venom extraction in the United States. Working alongside Haast, Whitaker learned to handle venomous snakes, maintain them in captivity, and extract venom for medical use. ""Bill Haast was my guru,"" he says. ""He taught me respect for snakes, not just technique.""When Whitaker returned to India, he had a clear idea: The country needed a place where people could learn about snakes scientifically rather than fear them blindly. That idea took shape in 1969 with the opening of the Madras Snake Park. Visitors arrived sceptical-some expecting spectacle, others danger. Whitaker himself was often viewed as an eccentric outsider. But the park was never meant to entertain. It was an educational experiment. For the first time, ordinary people could see snakes up close, learn to identify species, and understand that most snakes were not out to harm them.Over the decades, the impact has been profound. India today has thousands of snake rescuers, a reality Whitaker views with cautious optimism. While rescue work has reduced routine killings, it has also become performative in some cases. Kerala, he notes, stands out for institutionalizing rescue work. By registering rescuers, issuing identity cards, and maintaining an online database, the state has created a system rooted in accountability and data. The model has since been adopted by Karnataka and is being replicated in Tamil Nadu Snakebite, however, remains one of India's most under-recognized public health crises. For decades, official statistics claimed around 1,400 deaths annually. A nationwide ""Million Deaths Study"" based on verbal autopsies revealed a far grimmer reality: Over 50,000 deaths every year, with nearly one million snakebite incidents. Many victims never reach hospitals, either dying en route or seeking traditional remedies instead of medical treatment.""The key word is prevention,"" Whitaker says. Simple measures-using a torch at night, wearing footwear, being cautious near pump houses-could prevent a significant proportion of bites. Improved reporting, he adds, has made it seem as though cases are increasing, when in fact awareness and documentation have improved. Treating snakebite as a medical emergency rather than a cultural or mystical phenomenon remains the biggest challenge.Few initiatives illustrate Whitaker's belief in practical, science-based solutions better than his long association with the Irula tribal community of Tamil Nadu. For generations, the Irulas survived by catching snakes for their skins. When the skin trade was banned, their livelihood vanished overnight. Working with the community, Whitaker helped develop a new model: Irula snake catchers would capture snakes, extract venom under controlled conditions, and release them back into the wild. The venom would then be supplied to pharmaceutical companies to manufacture antivenom.""They are saving lakhs of human lives,"" Whitaker says. Today, around 350 Irula families supply venom that meets India's entire antivenom requirement. For him, it remains the country's only true example of sustainable wildlife use-one that benefits both people and animals without depleting wild populations.Human-animal conflict remains one of conservation's most complex challenges. India's tiger, leopard, and crocodile populations have all increased-a remarkable achievement by global standards. But many of these animals now live outside protected forests. Leopards, in particular, thrive in agricultural landscapes, raising cubs in sugarcane fields and feeding on small animals and stray dogs. ""Leopards don't need forests the way we think they do,"" Whitaker explains. ""They've adapted to living alongside people.""Problems arise when human panic leads to capture and relocation-an intervention that often worsens conflict. Whitaker's own experience reinforced this lesson. Living on a small farm near Chennai, he once lost a dog to a leopard. His first instinct was to call the forest department. Then came the realisation: ""We moved into his territory. He didn't move into ours."" Simple precautions, like keeping dogs indoors at night, resolved the issue without endangering the cat.Lenin agrees that human-wildlife conflict is not new, but says its nature has changed. Earlier, communities managed interactions locally. ""The law took away that freedom, but the state did not fulfil its responsibility of sorting out the issue,"" she says. Many conflicts today, she argues, are effectively state-created-especially in the case of elephants, which require vast landscapes and abundant food. Habitat disruption leaves marginalized communities bearing the burden of coexistence, even though they are the least equipped to do so.Whitaker is critical of how crop-raiding wildlife is managed, particularly in Kerala, one of the few states where wild boars that devastate farmlands are legally permitted to be killed but must then be buried. Recalling ecologist Madhav Gadgil's public criticism of the policy, Whitaker questions the logic of wasting what is a valuable protein source. ""These animals can destroy paddy or peanut fields as much as an elephant does, but after killing them, you are told to bury the meat. People are always in need of protein, especially in rural areas. He recounts seeing electric fences in parts of north India where nilgai, jackals, and peacocks were killed indiscriminately and left to rot. For him, science-based preventive infrastructure works far better than reactionary measures.He regards Indira Gandhi as India's most conservation-minded Prime Minister, instrumental in legislations such as the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. ""She had come to the Snake Park in Madras in 1972, and then we told her about the problems that were happening. When Rajiv became the prime minister, we spoke to him about the Andamans and the deforestation there, and they stopped it. These were the times when you could actually speak to a prime minister and the next day you might see some action; I would love to see that happening today. ""When Whitaker received the Padma Shri, he briefly met Prime Minister Narendra Modi but did not get the chance to speak at length. He later sent a draft message to the PM's office, hoping for a mention of snakebite prevention during Mann Ki Baat. ""If the PM spoke for even one minute about snakebite as a medical emergency, and about the importance of govt hospitals being equipped to handle it, thousands of lives could be saved,"" he says.When he first documented India's snakes, around 275 species were known. Today, more than 360 have been recorded. For young people entering herpetology, he sees unprecedented opportunities through universities and research institutions.""Go there, volunteer, and learn,"" he advises. ""Observe, respect, and don't try to be a hero. Conservation is about patience and understanding, not spectacle.""Now in his eighties, Whitaker continues to focus on snakebite mitigation through films and awareness campaigns. From a child defending a snake to a man who has spent a lifetime persuading a nation to rethink its fears, his story is ultimately about understanding nature and choosing scientific knowledge over fear.(Romulus Whitaker was in Kochi with his partner, writer Janaki Lenin, for the Blue & Green Climate LitFest 2025 organized by Climate Action Today & Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies)",Romulus whitaker is one of india's most influential conservationists.

Forest encroachment in state smacks of bureaucrat-squatter nexus: Supeme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/forest-encroachment-in-state-smacks-of-bureaucrat-squatter-nexus-supeme-court/articleshow/126363334.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday slammed the Uttarakhand govt for being a silent spectator for two decades to rampant encroachment of forest land in Rishikesh , which was allotted in 1950 to Gandhian Mira Behn by the then UP govt, and said it smacked of nexus between the executive and squatters. The court also sought details of such illegal constructions.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said the facts of this case, prima facie, show how private individuals systematically grabbed thousands of acres of forest land while the state govt remained in slumber from 2000 till 2023.Uttarakhand’s deputy advocate general Jatinder Kumar Sethi informed the court that the state had recovered around 500 acres of forest land from encroachers in 2023 and an additional 50 acres in the drive carried out in the last three days at Rishikesh. He said the state would continue the drive against encroachers.However, the bench said the way squatters enjoyed residential rights unauthorisedly over vast tracts of forest land for more than two decades indicated collusion among politicians, bureaucrats and encroachers. It asked the state to file a detailed affidavit describing the extent of encroachment, nature of constructions and the officers who were at the helm of affairs between 2000-2023 for protection of govt land in the area.Of the 2,866 acres of land notified as forest area by the state, a part was leased to Pashulok Sewa Samiti, which was an organization associated with Pashulok Ashram established by British born Mira Behn (Madeleine Slade). The society came under liquidation and surrendered 594 acres of land to the forest department on Oct 23, 1984. Yet certain private individuals took control of the land.The bench in its previous order had said, “What seems shocking to us is that the State of Uttarakhand and its authorities are sitting as silent spectators when the forest land was being systematically grabbed in front of their eyes.” It enlarged the scope of the petition and directed the state’s chief secretary and principal chief conservator of forest to constitute an inquiry committee to examine all issues and submit a report to SC.“Meanwhile, all private individuals are restrained from alienating the land, encumbering it or creating any third-party rights. It goes without saying that no construction activity shall be allowed to take place either. The vacant land (other than the residential houses) shall be taken into possession by the forest department and the collector concerned,” the bench had ordered on Dec 22 last year.",The court also sought details of such illegal constructions.

However, the meeting did not take place. “Such a meeting was not scheduled. Also, the public meeting attended by Shah in Pudukottai was a BJP event, not an NDA event. Hence, allies were not invited,” a BJP member said.Former AIADMK minister S P Velumani met Shah twice. Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal, who is BJP Tamil Nadu poll in-charge, was present during the first interaction. However, both AIADMK and BJP functionaries remained tight-lipped about the talks.Meanwhile, BJP sources said Shah may visit Chennai again later this month, when he could meet EPS.Shah also chaired a BJP core committee meeting on Sunday. On Monday, Shah visited Jambukeswarar temple in Thiruvanaikoil and Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam. He later reached Trichy-Madurai NH, where BJP organised ‘Namma Ooru Modi Pongal Vizha’, a traditional Pongal celebration featuring 1,008 pots.
