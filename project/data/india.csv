PM Modi at Pongal celebrations at minister L Murugan’s Delhi residence

A few days ago, I was in the sacred land of Somnath to be part of the Somnath Swabhiman Parv, marking a thousand years since the first attack on Somnath, which took place in 1026. People from all across India had come to be part of this moment of remembrance, united by a shared reverence for history, culture and the enduring spirit of the people of India. During the programme, I met a few people who had previously come to Somnath during the Saurashtra-Tamil Sangamam and had been to Kashi during the Kashi Tamil Sangamam.Their words of appreciation for such platforms touched me and so, I thought of sharing a few thoughts on this subject.During one of the Mann Ki Baat programmes, I had said that not learning Tamil is a major regret of my life. Fortunately, over the last few years, our govt has had several opportunities to further popularise Tamil culture across India and to deepen the spirit of ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.’ A prime example of such an effort is the Kashi-Tamil Sangamam. In our ethos, Sangam or confluence has a special place. Seen in this light, the KashiTamil Sangamam stands out as a truly distinctive initiative, one that celebrates the living unity of India’s many traditions while honouring their unique identities.And what can be a better place than Kashi to host such a Sangamam. The same Kashi, which has remained a civilisational anchor from time immemorial… where, for thousands of years, people from all over have come in search of knowledge, meaning and Moksha.Kashi’s connection with Tamil people and culture is very deep. It is in Kashi that Baba Vishwanath resides, while Tamil Nadu has Rameswaram. Tenkasi in Tamil Nadu is known as Kashi of the south or Dakshin Kashi. Saint Kumaraguruparar Swamigal forged a lasting link between Kashi and Tamil Nadu through his spirituality, scholarship and institution-building. Mahakavi Subramania Bharati, one of Tamil Nadu’s greatest sons, found in Kashi a space of intellectual growth and spiritual awakening. It was here that his nationalism deepened, his poetry sharpened and his vision of a free, united India took clearer shape. There are several such instances that highlight this close bond.The first edition of KashiTamil Sangamam took place in 2022. I recall attending the inauguration programme. Scholars, artisans, students, farmers, writers, professionals and many others from Tamil Nadu travelled to Kashi, Prayagraj and Ayodhya.Subsequent editions expanded the scale and depth of this effort. The aim was to keep introducing fresh themes, innovative formats and deeper engagement, thus ensuring that the Sangamam continued to evolve while remaining rooted in its core spirit. In the second edition in 2023, technology was used on a larger scale to ensure that language does not become a barrier for people. In the third edition, the focus was on Indian knowledge systems. At the same time, academic discussions, cultural performances, exhibitions and interactions witnessed greater participation. Thousands of people have taken part in these events.The fourth edition of the Kashi Tamil Sangamam commenced on Dec 2, 2025. The theme picked was very interesting, Tamil Karkalam — Learn Tamil. It presented aunique opportunity for people in Kashi and other parts to learn the beautiful Tamil language. Teachers came from Tamil Nadu and the students of Kashi had a very memorable experience! There were many other special events this time.Tholkappiyam, the ancient Tamil literary classic, was translated into 4 Indian languages and 6 foreign languages.A unique event, Sage Agasthya Vehicle Expedition (SAVE), was undertaken from Tenkasi to Kashi. On the way, various initiatives such as eye camps, health awareness camps, digital literacy camps, among other things, were held. The expedition paid homage to King Adi Veera Parakrama Pandiyan, the great Pandya ruler who spread the message of cultural oneness. There were exhibitions at Namo Ghat, academic sessions at Banaras Hindu University, as well as cultural programmes.One of the things that makes me most happy about the Kashi-Tamil Sangamam is the participation of thousands of youngsters. It illustrates the passion among our Yuva Shakti to deepen their connect with our roots. It is a brilliant platform for them to showcase their talent and creativity during the various cultural programmes.In addition to the Sangamam, efforts have been made to make the journey to Kashi memorable for the participants. The Indian Railways operated special trains to take people from Tamil Nadu to Uttar Pradesh. In many railway stations, particularly in Tamil Nadu, they were cheered, and the train journey was marked by melodious songs and conversations.Here, I would also like to appreciate my sisters and brothers of Kashi and Uttar Pradesh for their warmth and hospitality shown to the delegates of the various Kashi-Tamil Sangamams. Several people opened the doors of their homes for the guests from Tamil Nadu. The local administration worked round the clock to ensure the guests had a seamless experience. As the MP from Varanasi, I could not be prouder! This time, the valedictory function of the Kashi-Tamil Sangamam was held in Rameswaram and it was graced by the Vice-President of India, Thiru CP Radhakrishnan Ji, who is himself a proud son of Tamil Nadu. He delivered a very inspiring address, emphasising India’s spiritual greatness and how such platforms deepen national integration.The Kashi Tamil Sangamam has delivered meaningful outcomes like strengthening cultural understanding, fostering academic and people-to-people exchanges and creating lasting bonds between parts of the country that share a civilisational ethos. In the coming times, we want to make this platform even more vibrant. Most importantly, it has furthered the spirit of ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’. This spirit has flourished for centuries through our festivals, literature, music, art, cuisine, architecture, systems of knowledge and more.This time of the year is very auspicious for people across the length and breadth of India. People are enthusiastically marking various festivals like Sankranti, Uttarayan, Pongal , Magh Bihu, which are, among other things, associated with the Sun, nature and farming. These festivals bring people together and deepen the spirit of harmony in our society. I convey my best wishes for these festivals and hope they continue to inspire us to deepen national unity through our shared heritage and collective participation.The writer is the Prime Minister of India","Pm modi was in the sacred land of somnath to mark a thousand years since the first attack on the holy site.

Sacrifices of IPKF troops who took part in Lanka peace mission neglected: Rajnath,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sacrifices-of-ipkf-troops-who-took-part-in-lanka-peace-mission-neglected-rajnath/articleshow/126536797.cms,"NEW DELHI: The sacrifices of Indian soldiers during Operation Pawan in Sri Lanka nearly 40 years ago should be recognised and honoured, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Wednesday regretting that the then govts did not “respect” their contributions.“The decision taken by the then govt to send Indian troops to Sri Lanka is open to debate, but the neglect of IPKF troops who took part in the operation cannot be justified in any sense. Their sacrifice and struggle during that period was not respected,” Rajnath said at an event to mark the 10th Armed Forces Veterans’ Day. India had lost around 1,200 soldiers during the IPKF’s stay in Sri Lanka between July 1987 and March 1990.The Modi govt is “not only acknowledging the contribution of the peacekeepers who participated in Operation Pawan with an open mind, but is also in the process of recognising their contribution at every level”, he said, adding that during the operation Pawan, the Indian forces displayed amazing courage and valour.“Many soldiers died in the line of duty. Their courage and sacrifice should have been an inspiration for our future generations, but unfortunately it did not happen,” Rajnath said.When PM Narendra Modi visited Sri Lanka in 2015, he paid homage to Indian soldiers at the IPKF memorial, he said. “Now, we are also recognising the contributions of the IPKF soldiers at the National War Memorial in New Delhi and giving them the respect they deserve,” the minister said.India and Sri Lanka signed a historic peace accord on July 29, 1987, following which New Delhi deployed the IPKF in the island nation to bring peace in Tamil-dominated areas that had witnessed widespread violence and civil strife for years. However, peace eluded the regions and the IPKF was eventually pulled out. While the decision to send the IPKF was taken by the Rajiv Gandhi govt, the troops were pulled out of the island nation when the VP Singh dispensation was in power.Rajnath described veterans as the living pillars of national consciousness, symbols of collective courage, and an inspiration to the future generations. He urged them to guide the youth through their experiences. provide the right direction to Agniveers and young soldiers. He reiterated his govt’s resolve of veterans’ welfare, enumerating the concrete steps taken in this direction, including fulfilling the long-pending demand of One Rank One Pension (OROP) and strengthening Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS).The secretary (ex-servicemen welfare) pointed out that around 60,000 soldiers retire every year, resulting in about 3.5 million veterans, which indicates that the welfare of ex-servicemen is a huge responsibility that the nation must fulfil.","India lost around 1,200 soldiers during the ipkf’s stay in sri lanka between july 1987 and march 1990.

Chandigarh​​​​​​​ Headlines Today — Key Stories You Shouldn’t Miss.

7 flights cancelled

Trains feel heat too







CHANDIGARH: For nearly five hours, around 180 weary passengers circled the skies, hoping to touch down in Chandigarh. Instead, their IndiGo flight returned to Mumbai at 2.19 am after fog led to the closure of the runway at Shaheed Bhagat Singh International Airport, turning a routine journey into a night of chaos, protests, and unexpected detours.According to information, IndiGo flight 6E6715, which operates daily from Mumbai to Chandigarh, was scheduled to depart Mumbai at 8.20pm and land in Chandigarh at 10.25 pm. However, on Monday, the flight took off more than an hour late at 9.39 pm from Mumbai.

MUMBAI: As Maharashtra heads to elections on Thursday for 29 municipal corporations, all eyes are on Mumbai, where the BJP-led Mahayuti is locked in a battle with the united Thackeray front for control of the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Polling for the 2,869 seats spread across 893 wards will begin at 7.30 am and conclude at 5.30 pm on January 15. A total of 3.48 crore voters are eligible to decide the fate of 15,931 candidates, including 1,700 in Mumbai and 1,166 in Pune. Counting of votes will take place on January 16.More than 25,000 police personnel, including senior officers, will be deployed across Mumbai to oversee elections to the BMC and vote counting. Except for Mumbai, the other 28 urban bodies have multi-member wards.This will be the Shiv Sena’s first BMC election since the 2022 split, when Eknath Shinde broke away with a majority of the party’s legislators, along with its name and symbol. The undivided Shiv Sena had held sway over the country’s richest civic body for 25 years.In a political turn ahead of the elections, estranged cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray reunited after two decades in their bid to consolidate Marathi votes, even as rival NCP factions forged a local alliance in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.In this election, the Opposition Congress has asserted its presence in Mumbai by stepping out of the shadow of its Maha Vikas Aghadi allies — Shiv Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar's NCP (SP). The Congress has joined hands with Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) and the Rashtriya Samaj Paksh in the state capital, even as it contests independently in Nagpur.Elections to 29 municipal corporations are being held after a gap of over six years, with their terms having ended between 2020 and 2023. Of these, nine fall within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the most urbanised belt in India.The battlegrounds include Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Kalyan-Dombivli, Kolhapur, Nagpur, Mumbai, Solapur, Amravati, Akola, Nashik, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Pune, Ulhasnagar, Thane, Chandrapur, Parbhani, Mira-Bhayandar, Nanded-Waghala, Panvel, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Latur, Malegaon, Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad, Jalgaon, Ahilyanagar, Dhule, Jalna, and Ichalkaranji.Chief Minister Fadnavis, along with his deputies Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar, campaigned extensively across Maharashtra, while cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray concentrated their efforts on Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, and Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, where Uddhav held a rally. Telangana minister Mohammad Azharuddin, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, and Tamil Nadu BJP leader K Annamalai were also among the star campaigners for the polls.Populist promises for women were the highlight of the manifestos of both the Mahayuti and the Shiv Sena (UBT)-MNS. The Mahayuti has promised a 50 per cent concession for women in BEST bus travel, while the Thackeray cousins have assured a Rs 1,500 monthly allowance for women domestic helps and a property tax waiver on houses up to 700 sq ft. The Congress manifesto, by contrast, prioritises combating Mumbai’s pollution, upgrading the BEST fleet, and strengthening the city’s financial health.The race for Mumbai’s mayoral post took centre stage in the campaign, with the BJP claiming that a Sena (UBT) victory could lead to a Muslim mayor, a charge the Uddhav Thackeray-led party countered by assuring voters of a Marathi mayor. CM Fadnavis also guaranteed that the mayor will be a ""Hindu and Marathi.""In the 227-ward Mumbai, the BJP is contesting 137 seats, the Shiv Sena 90, while the NCP is fighting separately on 94 seats. The Shiv Sena (UBT) has fielded 163 candidates, the MNS 52, the Congress 143 and the VBA 46. The Congress has fielded 1,263 candidates across the rest of the state.The Maharashtra State Election Commission on Friday announced that Thursday, January 15, will be a public holiday in areas falling under the 29 municipal corporations where polling will be held, an official said.The holiday will apply to government and semi-government offices, corporations, boards, public undertakings, banks, and central government offices within the jurisdiction of the civic bodies.The poll comission said administrative preparations, including readiness of EVMs, have been completed and urged the public to take an active part in the democratic exercise.","Elections to 29 municipal corporations are being held after a gap of over six years.

SRINAGAR: Former J&K chief minister and PDP Mehbooba Mufti on Wednesday denounced what she called “profiling of mosques” by police, saying it amounted to interference in religious affairs and was an attempt to humiliate Kashmiri Muslims. It’s Hindu temples that needed to be “profiled”, she said.“If religious places are to be profiled, then start with temples. Identify who the priest is, whether he is a Dalit or a Brahmin, and how much money is charged for temple entry. None of this happens in our mosques,” Mehbooba said.Displaying a four-page police form, she said information about lands and management of mosques was already with the administration, but police were now seeking photographs, Aadhaar numbers and other personal details of imams, mosque management members and worshippers. “This kind of intense profiling is meant to push Kashmiri Muslims away from their religion,” the PDP chief said. “How much more you humiliate Kashmiri Muslims?”She also criticised CM Omar Abdullah for not speaking out on the issue. “Even if the police are not under him, he still has a voice and tongue,” she said.Alleging that “mosques are being treated like crime scenes”, Mehbooba said: “Will you do this with temples, gurdwaras or churches? This is not happening anywhere else in the country.”Accusing the govt of targeting Muslim institutions, she warned that the mosque-profiling exercise could be extended across the country. “What does the govt have to do with whether someone is Shia, Sunni or Barelvi? Mosques are open to all, unlike many temples where Dalits and women are barred,” she said.",Former j&k chief minister and pdp mehbooba mufti denounced what she called ‘profiling of mosques’ by police.

Why this matters now

NEW DELHI: As Maharashtra voters prepare to cast their ballots for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) election, knowing the exact polling booth location is a crucial first step before heading out to vote. While polling booth details are mentioned on voter slips distributed ahead of elections, voters can also easily check the same information online using their EPIC (Electors Photo Identity Card) number.According to official guidelines, voters can search their polling booth location through the Maharashtra State Election Commission’s voter services portal. The process is simple and can be completed in a few minutes.Once voters confirm their name on the electoral roll and polling booth location, they are advised to carry a valid photo identity document such as Aadhaar, PAN card or passport to the polling station.

Where is Sena (UBT) headed?

The January 15 Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections will be an acid test for the Shiv Sena (UBT), marking its third electoral battle since the dramatic split of June 2022. Having lost control of the civic body it governed for 25 consecutive years as the undivided Shiv Sena , it is now seeking to reclaim Mumbai’s powerful municipal corporation, which last went to the polls in February 2017.The task, however, is far from straightforward for the Uddhav Thackeray-led Sena (UBT). In a bid to consolidate the Marathi vote, the former Maharashtra chief minister has formed an alliance with his once-estranged cousin Raj Thackeray. Raj had broken away from the Shiv Sena in November 2005 to form the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) in March 2006.Despite this reunion, Sena (UBT) confronts multiple hurdles in its effort to regain control of the Maharashtra capital’s municipal authority — India’s richest civic corporation and one of the wealthiest in Asia.The civic body, formally known as the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), was established in 1873. It was only in 1948 — the year following India’s independence — that the BMC held its first elections based on adult franchise.The corporation, with an annual budget exceeding those of several small states, introduced 140 single-member constituencies in 1963, followed by elections in 1968. The number was later increased to 170 (in 1982) and then 221 (in 1991).The current strength of the corporation — 227 seats — was fixed in 2002.The corporation’s long history, its status as the civic body of the country’s largest metropolis — also the nation’s financial and entertainment capital — and its close links with the state’s politics mean that the BMC polls carry greater significance than many state assembly elections and attract more attention than those forany other municipal corporation.A significantly weakened Shiv Sena (UBT) now faces the following challenges in its bid to wrest back control of the BMC.The BMC has often been referred to as a “Sena-controlled” body. Yet, this description does not tell the fullstory - the party has never won an outright majority on its own and has always governed by forming alliances. It first won the BMC in 1985, securing 74 out of 170 seats (140 contested). Its best performance to date came in 1997, when it won 103 of the total 221 seats. After that, its tally slipped below 100, eventually settling at 84 in 2017, proof of its limitations.Initially the junior partner in its alliance with the Sena, the BJP finally became the “big brother” in the 2014 Maharashtra assembly elections and later, the state’s largest party. Its BMC tally, which had long hovered in the 20s and 30s since its formation in 1980, surged dramatically to 82 in 2017—just two short of its then-ally. It now aims to take control of the corporation for the first time, a task that, while not straightforward, appears less challenging than it once did.The Sena split dealt a double blow to Uddhav Thackeray . Not only did it bring down his MVA government and saw him lose the status of the “real” Shiv Sena, but the real damage came in Eknath Shinde taking away a large portion of the original Shiv Sena’s core strength—its ground cadre—and its traditional vote base. In the 2019 assembly polls, the united Shiv Sena had won around 16% of the vote. Five years later, the two factions together secured what would have been over 20% vote as a joint entity: 12% for the Shinde group and 10% for Uddhav.The score currently stands at 1-1: the Uddhav faction emerged ahead in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, while the Shinde group led in the state elections just a few months later.Often labelled a “firebrand” leader, Raj Thackeray has struggled to convert rhetoric into lasting electoral gains for the MNS. The party, known primarily for its anti-migrant plank, peaked early—winning 13 seats in the 2009 Maharashtra assembly elections, including six in Mumbai. Its only other notable success came in the 2012 BMC polls, where it secured 27 seats, a performance it has been unable to replicate since. Beyond these brief highs, the MNS has struggled to remain electorally relevant as Maharashtra’s politics consolidated around bigger players.The proportion of Marathi-speaking residents in Mumbai is lower than might be expected—not surprising for a cosmopolitan city. The 2011 Census showed that in the capital of a Marathi-speaking state, only 35% of the 12.5 million residents reported it as their mother tongue, followed by Hindi at 25% (and naturally, not all Marathi-speakers in the city vote for either party).Further, the anti-migrant image of both Sena (UBT) and MNS limits their reach among the non-Marathi communities.Historically, Muslims had largely avoided voting for the Shiv Sena because of its Hindutva identity. That changed in 2019 with the formation of the MVA. Many in the community voted for the Sena (UBT) also to keep the BJP out—a pattern seen with anti-BJP parties in other parts of India. Uddhav’s new “moderate” image also played a big role in drawing Muslims votes. According to a CSDS study, the MVA secured 55% of the Muslim vote in the 2024 state elections, while the BJP-led Mahayuti received 22% of the community’s support.With Sena (UBT) now aligned with the MNS, another Hindutva party, it remains to be seen whether Muslim voters will continue to back Uddhav Thackeray. The presence of other parties for whom the community has traditionally voted could also lead to a fragmentation of the vote.As per the 2011 Census, Muslims constituted 21% of the city’s population.Civic issues are expected to play a key role in the BMC elections, with annual monsoon waterlogging remaining one of Mumbai’s most persistent problems. Despite repeated promises and heavy spending on drainage projects, large parts of the city continue to be paralysed every year. Given the Shiv Sena’s long dominance of the BMC, this issue is closely linked to its civic governance record, making it a crucial test for Sena (UBT) as it seeks to reclaim control of the corporation.It is often said in politics that 1 + 1 equals 11, not two. With little to lose and much to gain, a reunion of the Thackerays could play to their advantage. While the sympathy factor did not help Uddhav Thackeray in the 2024 state polls, a renewed alliance with his cousin could resonate strongly with Marathi pride and identity.The numbers also offer encouraging signs for the Sena (UBT). Of its 20 seats in the Maharashtra assembly, Mumbai alone accounts for half. In six of these constituencies, UBT candidates even defeated nominees from the Shinde faction, suggesting that the party’s core base in the metropolis has not completely eroded.In their joint manifesto, titled “Vachan Nama, Shabd Thackerencha” (promissory note of the Thackerays), the Shiv Sena (UBT)–MNS alliance has promised that Mumbai’s land would be usednly for housing Mumbaikars. It has also announced that the BMC would have its own housing authority, 100 units of free power for residential use through the Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST) Undertaking, Rs 1,500 financial assistance for house helps and women from the Koli community, women’s restrooms on major roads, and a property tax waiver for houses up to 700 sq ft, among other civic measures.The long-delayed BMC polls will test Sena (UBT)’s relevance in Mumbai, the city of its birth and its home since then. After years of ups and downs, the results will show whether the Thackeray faction can rebuild its base and reclaim influence in the city. A win would provide a much-needed boost, while a defeat would leave the party grappling with even more questions about its future.","The brihanmumbai municipal corporation (bmc) elections will be an acid test for the shiv sena (ubt) it is the party's third electoral battle since the dramatic split of june 2022.

What Singapore cops uncovered

NEW DELHI: Zubeen Garg was “severely intoxicated” and drowned off Lazarus Island after declining a life jacket, a Singapore court was told on Wednesday. The Singapore police reiterated that it does not suspect any foul play in the death.""At the time, he was also severely intoxicated and several witnesses saw him trying to swim back to the yacht when he went limp and began floating with his face in the water,"" Channel News Asia reported citing the investigating officer.The court was further told that Garg had a history of hypertension and epilepsy, with his most recent recorded epileptic episode occurring in 2024. However, it remained uncertain whether he had taken his prescribed epilepsy medication on the day of the incident, as eyewitness accounts are insufficient to confirm that he had done so.Police told the court that their investigation revealed Garg and around 20 others on board the yacht, including friends and colleagues, had consumed snacks, drinks and alcohol during the outing. Multiple witnesses stated that Garg was seen drinking alcohol, with one account claiming he consumed several cups of liquor, including gin and whisky.According to the chief investigating officer’s reconstruction of events, Garg later went for a swim during which he removed his life jacket.He subsequently returned to the yacht and was heard telling others that he was feeling tired, the officer informed the court.“When he decided to resume swimming, Garg was offered a second, smaller life jacket, but he declined to wear it. He entered the water without a life jacket and started swimming in the direction of Lazarus Island alone,” the Channel cited chief investigating officer saying.The officer told the court that post-mortem examination confirmed drowning as the cause of Garg’s death, and while some injuries were found on the body, they were determined to have occurred during CPR and rescue attempts. The officer added that medical tests detected Garg’s prescribed medication for hypertension and epilepsy in his blood, with no traces of any other drugs.Moreover, they said that a toxicology report showed Garg had a blood alcohol concentration of 333 milligrams per 100 ml of blood, indicating severe intoxication that would have significantly impaired coordination and reflexes.“The evidence of several witnesses, provided via their statements to the court, stated that Mr Garg had no suicidal tendencies and that he was not pushed into the water but had jumped in himself for a swim,” the news website report said, quoting the court hearing.However, as per the probe conducted by the SIT and the Assam Police’s CID, those named as accused include the principal event organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta, Zubeen Garg’s manager Siddharth Sharma, suspended APS officer Sandipan Garg, and two personal security officers, Nandeswar Bora and Paresh Baishya.The CJI court in Guwahati remanded five accused — Shyamkanu Mahanta, Siddharth Sharma, Sandipan Garg, Nandeswar Bora, and Paresh Baishya — to judicial custody in connection with the Garg death case.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma assured justice saying: ""Another step forward towards justice for our beloved Zubeen. The Singapore Police authorities will meet the Assam Police team led by Sri Munna Gupta, ADGP and Head of SIT, on 21st October. Our collective resolve remains, Justice for Zubeen will prevail.""Garg died in Singapore on September 19, reportedly after an incident while swimming, just a day before he was slated to perform at the Northeast India Festival.","Zubeen garg was “severely intoxicated” and drowned off lazarus island after declining a life jacket, a singapore court was told on wednesday.

Rahul Gandhi’s support for Vijay’s 'Jana Nayagan': Message to DMK or push for new coalition with TVK in Tamil Nadu?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-gandhis-support-for-vijays-jana-nayagan-message-to-dmk-or-push-for-new-coalition-with-tvk-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/126525319.cms,"Thalapathy Vijay’s Jana Nayagan Gets Morning Relief, Evening Setback — Next Hearing Jan 21

NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi ’s strong support for actor-politician Vijay after delay in censor certification for Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) chief's film 'Jana Nayagan' has set tongues wagging about a possible political realignment in poll-bound Tamil Nadu. 'Jana Nayagan', which is widely publicised as Vijay's final film before his full-fledged entry into politics, was slated for a Pongal release on January 9. However, the film ran into last-minute hurdles after the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) did not issue certification in time.Rallying behind Vijay, Rahul attacked the Centre and said the I&B ministry’s ""attempt to block"" 'Jana Nayagan' was an attack on Tamil culture. He also targeted the Prime Minister and said: ""Mr Modi, you will never succeed in suppressing the voice of the Tamil people.” The TVK has been quick to acknowledge Rahul’s support as a “friendly gesture.”While the Tamil Nadu Congress has denied any “political motive” behind Rahul’s gesture, the fact remains that this comes at a time when the grand-old-party’s ties with its old ally DMK has been tense over demands of power sharing.The DMK and the Congress have been partners in Tamil Nadu for long and have contested several elections together, but the grand-old party has not been a part of the DMK government in the state.The Congress wants that to change now. When Congress MP Manickam Tagore said the time has come to move beyond seat-sharing and initiate discussions on the sharing of power, he was echoing the sentiments of a section of the party.However, this “power sharing” proposal was nipped in the bud by the DMK. Ruling out any scope for coalition government, senior DMK leader and state minister I Periyasamy said: ""There had never been a coalition government. The state had all along been helmed by the DMK on its own. There is no doubt about this stand of the party, there will be no coalition government and the chief minister is firm on this stand.""So, what should the Congress do? Continue with this arrangement that has been in place for years or chart a different course with a new ally?The politics of Tamil Nadu has traditionally been bipolar between two arch political rivals - the DMK and the AIADMK. However, 2026 could be different. There’s a third regional player in the fray. The entry of actor-turned-politician Joseph Vijay Chandrasekhar, fondly known as Thalapathy Vijay, has made the upcoming electoral contest interesting. Vijay’s Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) has already made an impressive start giving jitters to the two established regional players.Vijay is confident that his TVK will script history in the elections - just as it had happened in the 1967 and 1977 assembly elections in the state. The DMK had won for the first time in 1967 while the AIADMK won elections a decade later.While the TVK has not opened its alliance cards, Vijay has made it clear several times that his party will not join hands with either the DMK or the BJP. The actor-politician had also said that if there were any alliance in the future, it would be led by the TVK and opposed to both the DMK and the BJP.It is in this context that Rahul Gandhi’s support for Vijay has raised interest. Already there have been speculations about a tie up after TVK’s national spokesperson Felix Gerald had called the Congress a “natural ally.” ""The Congress and TVK are natural allies in terms of secularism and their stand against communalism. In that sense, we have always been natural partners. Rahul Gandhi and our leader are also friends,"" Gerald had said.Adding fuel to this fire was senior Congress leader and head of the party's Data Analytics Unit, Praveen Chakravarty, who later met TVK leader Vijay.Which brings us to the question: Is the Congress seriously considering a third front in Tamil Nadu under the leadership of Vijay or is the grand-old party using Vijay's party to bargain “power sharing” deal and extra seats with the DMK?Perhaps, we may have some answers on Congress’s future course of action in the state after Rahul’s meeting with senior state leaders in Delhi on Jan 18 and 19.",Rahul gandhi’s strong support for actor-politician vijay after delay in censor certification for tamilaga vettri kazhagam (tvk) chief's film 'jana nayagan' has set tongues wagging about a possible political realignment in poll-bound tamil nadu.

NEET-PG cut-off score now fixed at -40 out of 800,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neet-pg-cut-off-score-now-fixed-at-40-out-of-800/articleshow/126514156.cms,"NEW DELHI: The government on Tuesday lowered qualifying cut-off for NEET-PG 2025, paving the way to fill over 9,000 vacant PG medical seats, amid concerns that a big chunk of training capacity was being wasted at a time of acute doctor shortages.Under the revised criteria, qualifying percentile for general and EWS candidates has been reduced from 50th to 7th percentile, and for general persons with benchmark disability (PwBD) from 45th to 5th percentile. For SC, ST and OBC candidates, the percentile has been reduced from 40 to zero, with the corresponding cut-off score fixed at -40 out of 800 (due to negative marking).The decision was notified by National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences (NBEMS), which revised qualifying percentiles across categories to expand eligibility for counselling and admissions. Officials said around 2.4 lakh candidates appeared for NEET-PG this year, but a high cut-off had left thousands of seats unfilled.Officials said India has 65,000-70,000 PG medical seats, and allowing nearly one in seven seats to remain vacant would weaken teaching hospitals and strain healthcare delivery, particularly in govt institutions that rely heavily on resident doctors. The relaxation followed a representation by Indian Medical Association (IMA), which had written to Union health minister JP Nadda on Jan 12, seeking a rational revision of cut-offs to prevent large-scale vacancies.Explaining the move, NBEMS officials said the entrance exam is meant to generate a merit list, not to reassess the competence of doctors who have already cleared MBBS and university exams. ""You can't afford to let 9,000-10,000 PG seats go to waste,"" an official said.The official acknowledged that sharp percentile reductions attract criticism but said the admission cycle was already delayed. ""Earlier, cut-offs were lowered in stages. This time, we are late. The focus is to fill seats and avoid losing national medical resources,"" he said.NBEMS clarified that the cut-off change does not alter exam scores or ranks, but only decides who is eligible to participate in counselling. Officials said the percentile system is used to rank already qualified doctors, and the cut-off was lowered simply to ensure enough candidates are available to fill all PG seats.IMA warned that vacant PG seats worsen resident doctor shortages, increase workload, disrupt academics and hurt patient care, especially in government and peripheral hospitals.","Government lowers qualifying cut-off for neet-pg 2025, paving the way to fill over 9,000 vacant pg medical seats.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The Calcutta high court on Wednesday disposed of a plea filed by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) seeking protection of its data following Enforcement Directorate (ED) raids at the office of political consultancy firm I-PAC and the residence of its director, Pratik Jain, last week. The decision came after the ED informed the court that it had “not seized anything” from either premises during the searches.The TMC had approached the high court after ED searches conducted on January 8, seeking judicial directions for the preservation of its personal and political data, which it feared could have been seized during the raids. The party maintained that I-PAC had served as its election consultant for six years and that its confidential data was at risk.Representing the ED, additional solicitor general SV Raju told the court that “nothing was seized” during the searches. Disposing of the TMC’s petition, Justice Suvra Ghosh observed that in view of the submissions made by the ED and the Union of India, “nothing further remains to be dealt with in the present petition.”During the hearing, the TMC argued, “Our petition is limited to the point that our personal political data be protected.It is inappropriate to bully a political party when it has filed a petition, believing that its data could be taken from its political consultant of six years.”The ED, however, sought disposal of the plea, reiterating, “Nothing has been seized. Whatever was taken was taken away by Mamata Banerjee .” The agency further told the court that the search operation had “nothing to do with Trinamool Congress,” adding, “The raid had nothing to do with the Trinamool Congress, and the person who was raided by the ED has not come before you.” It also said, “The search was conducted somewhere else, but another party is coming and saying that my data was with them. This is not how it works.”Justice Ghosh also adjourned a separate petition filed by the ED seeking a CBI probe into the events of January 8, when chief Minister Mamata Banerjee visited the I-PAC office in Salt Lake and Jain’s residence on Loudon Street during the searches. The court cited the ED’s decision to approach the Supreme Court with “almost identical” prayers as the reason for the adjournment.The ED has accused the West Bengal Police, allegedly acting in collusion with the chief minister, of obstructing its officials and claimed Banerjee entered the search sites and took away “key” evidence, including documents and electronic devices. The agency has sought an independent CBI inquiry, arguing that the alleged interference compromised its investigation.The matter is now set to be heard by the Supreme Court, where the ED has moved a plea alleging obstruction by the West Bengal government. The state government has filed a caveat.","The calcutta high court disposed of a plea filed by the trinamool congress (tmc) seeking protection of its data.

'Roz Gandhi Ko Maarte Ho': BJP MP Nishikant Dubey’s Fiery Speech Targets Cong, Triggers Chaos in LS

NEW DELHI: Lokpal has dismissed the allegation of BJP MP Nishikant Dubey possessing disproportionate assets as ""frivolous and vexatious"", slamming the complainant, former IPS officer and activist Amitabh Thakur, for indulging in ""whataboutery"" during the case's proceedings.The Lokpal, headed by former Supreme Court judge AM Khanwilkar, found Thakur's charge, made in May last year, ""devoid of merit"" and said Dubey was at liberty to pursue his grievance regarding breach of his privacy and damage to reputation by the complainant, who went public with his allegation.Lokpal said Thakur, who is under judicial custody after being arrested in Dec in an alleged cheating case, had relied completely on Dubey's election affidavits and focused mostly on the substantial increase in the assets of his wife, who is not a public servant. The anti-graft ombudsman agreed with the MP's contention that the rise in the value of his assets was mainly because of an escalation in their market price. He added his wife has an independent business.Dubey, who faced attacks from Congress over the allegation, lauded the verdict as ""satyamev jayate"", with BJP suggesting the case was an outcome of his relentless attack on the opposition party, especially the Gandhi family.

Why cut-offs for NEET-PG seats keep falling repeatedly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-cut-offs-for-neet-pg-seats-keep-falling-repeatedly/articleshow/126536411.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The repeated lowering of NEET-PG cut-offs has reignited concerns over the quality of postgraduate medical training, with critics warning that successive relaxations risk diluting standards at a time when patient care is already under strain.Health ministry officials acknowledge these concerns but argue that the policy reflects a difficult trade-off between preserving academic standards, addressing acute doctor shortages and utilising public investment. Each postgraduate medical seat costs govt several crores of rupees to create, officials said, and unfilled seats cannot be carried forward to next year.""Final competence is not tested at entry but at the exit stage,"" a senior official said, noting that all PG students undergo three years of supervised training and must clear final university exams where no relaxation is permitted.The immediate trigger for the latest cut-off reduction is the scale of vacancies. Around 9,000 PG seats are lying vacant under the All India Quota, officials said. When state quotas are included, the total number of unfilled postgraduate seats nationwide is estimated at around 18,000 - despite 1.5-2.2 lakh candidates appearing for NEET-PG each year.While 70-80% of PG seats are in clinical disciplines, a disproportionate share of vacant seats lie in pre- and para-clinical subjects such as anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pathology, microbiology and pharmacology.Some clinical seats also remain unfilled, particularly in peripheral govt hospitals, district hospitals and DNB institutions.Officials said the problem becomes evident after Round 1 and Round 2 of counselling, when seats in less developed institutions are repeatedly skipped. Candidates cite poor infrastructure, limited clinical exposure, low stipends, difficult locations and weak career prospects, often preferring to wait for another exam cycle or opt selectively for private colleges. To prevent seats from going to waste, the authorities lower the qualifying percentile before Round 3 of counselling, widening eligibility and avoiding automatic category conversions.Officials stressed this does not alter exam scores or ranks. NEET-PG, they said, is not a licensing exam but a ranking test to allocate seats among already qualified doctors.Dr Naval K Vikram, AIIMS professor from medicine department, clarified the percentile system works on a relative basis. ""If 100 candidates appear and the top scorer gets 76 marks, that candidate is assigned the 100th percentile. Percentile does not mean percentage marks,"" he said.Because of negative marking, candidates can score zero or even negative marks. ""A zero percentile only means the candidate is at the bottom of the ranking. It does not mean zero medical knowledge,"" he said.The reduction in NEET-PG qualifying percentiles is not new and has been used repeatedly in the past few years to address large numbers of vacant PG seats. In 2023, the qualifying percentile was lowered to zero across all categories. In 2024, it was reduced to the 5th percentile for all categories.In 2025, the qualifying criteria were relaxed further in a graded manner: the cut-off was brought down to the 7th percentile for General/EWS candidates, 5th percentile for General PwBD candidates, and 0 percentile for SC/ST/OBC candidates, including PwBD, reflecting continuing efforts to widen eligibility and fill unoccupied PG seats.Experts said in most exams, cut-offs are meant to preserve quality and lowering them too much risks diluting standards - a concern that remains central to the debate.A PG student, who cleared the exam, said that the system is often misunderstood. ""Seats remain vacant because many colleges and subjects are unattractive, not because there are no candidates,"" the student said.Officials admitted that the debate on quality cannot be ignored. According to them, the core problem is the uneven development of medical institutions. Well-equipped govt colleges and metro hospitals fill their seats early, while under-resourced centres struggle year after year.Critics warned that lowering cut-offs shifts focus away from improving institutions. ""Lowering cut-offs fills seats, but unless hospitals and training quality improve, it risks diluting postgraduate standards,"" said an official familiar with counselling data.IMA junior doctors' network spokesperson Dr Dhruv Chauhan said the move would disproportionately benefit private colleges. ""Money and class will decide healthcare outcomes instead of merit. Seats will again be sold for crores,"" he said.But officials maintained that until infrastructure improves and peripheral institutions become viable training centres, lowering cut-offs remains a temporary but necessary measure.",The repeated lowering of neet-pg cut-offs has reignited concerns over the quality of postgraduate medical training. Critics warn that successive relaxations risk diluting standards at a time when patient care is already under strain. The immediate trigger for the latest cut-off reduction is the scale of vacancies.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126536414,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-469249,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: To prevent thousands of postgraduate medical seats from going to waste, the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) has again allowed NEET-PG 2025 candidates to apply for conversion of nationality status from Indian to Non-Resident Indian (NRI) ahead of the third and final round of counselling.Conversion from Indian to NRI status is tightly regulated. Only blood relatives up to second-degree relations can sponsor a candidate, with mandatory affidavits, proof of relationship and evidence of financial capacity through NRI bank accounts. Applications are vetted by third-party agencies, and officials said most are rejected due to incomplete or invalid documentation. Even after eligibility expansion, many NRI seats remain vacant. Unfilled seats are eventually converted back to non-NRI seats and offered to general candidates, ensuring they are not wasted.Officials stressed the move does not create new seats, expand quotas or alter merit lists. ""This is only about widening eligibility to fill seats that already exist,"" an official said. ""The aim is to prevent wastage of PG seats, not to change rankings or increase numbers.""The provision is activated every year before specific counselling rounds.","Conversion from indian to nri status is tightly regulated.

VARANASI/HYDERABAD/BIDAR: Razor-sharp Chinese manja - glass-coated kite string, banned but still widely used - sliced through necks and faces Wednesday, killing at least three people in UP, Telangana and Karnataka while injuring well over 100 across states as Makar Sankranti celebrations and routine travel collided with lethal strands dangling across roads and bridges.In UP, 28-year-old doctor Sameer Hashmi bled to death after Chinese manja cut his throat near a public school campus.
