NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday backed nationwide protests by workers and farmers demanding protection of their rights.He flagged concerns over labour reforms, trade policies, and potential changes to the rural jobs programme MGNREGA.""Workers fear that the four labour codes will weaken their rights. Farmers are apprehensive that the trade agreement will harm their livelihoods. And weakening or scrapping MGNREGA could snatch away the last lifeline of villages. When decisions affecting their future were taken, their voices were ignored,"" he said through a post on X.""Will Modiji listen now? Or is the “grip” on him too strong? I stand firmly with the workers and farmers on their issues and their struggle,"" Rahul added.An all-India general strike called by ten Central Trade Unions (CTUs) and backed by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Thursday is aimed at opposing a range of government policies, including the four labour codes, privatisation and contractualisation measures, the Electricity Amendment Bill 2025, changes to MGNREGA and the proposed Seed Bill.Large-scale participation from farmers, agricultural workers and industrial unions is expected at protest sites across the country, with power sector employees, PRTC staff and other worker organisations also set to join.In a statement, the SKM said the strike seeks the withdrawal of the four labour codes, the Electricity Bill 2025, the Seed Bill 2025 and the VB-G RAM G Act 2025, among other demands. It also called for the restoration of the old pension scheme and the implementation of minimum wages for all workers, including scheme workers.Communist Party of India (CPI) leader and All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) working president Binoy Viswam expressed full support for the nationwide farmers’ strike, describing it as a movement to defend people’s basic rights.Apple farmers in Himachal Pradesh have also intensified preparations to join the nationwide farmers’ strike on February 12 and announced a march to Delhi, warning that recent import duty reductions under India-US and other free trade agreements could hurt the state’s apple-based economy.They expressed concern that cheaper imports could impact local growers, despite repeated assurances from union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal that the interests of Indian apple farmers will be safeguarded.While several trade unions and farmer organisations have decided to join the strike, the National Front of Indian Trade Unions (NFITU) said it would not participate, describing the protest as “politically motivated.”","Congress leader rahul gandhi backs nationwide protests by workers and farmers.

Why the strike was called





Impact on key sectors





What is likely to remain open





NEW DELHI: Over 10 central trade unions called for a nationwide Bharat Bandh on Thursday against the government’s “anti-worker” policies. The bandh was supported by farmer organisations and other groups across sectors.The strike call was announced as a mark of “resistance to anti-worker, anti-farmer and anti-national pro-corporate policies of the central government.”Trade unions said nearly 30 crore workers from various sectors were likely to participate in the agitation.The protest was expected to partially affect services such as banking, insurance and transport, with unions serving strike notices across departments and industrial establishments.Also read | Bharat bandh today: Are banks shut amid nationwide strike on February 12? The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) called upon farmers to join trade union workers in making the all-India general strike a success.In a statement, the SKM said the strike sought the withdrawal of four labour codes, the Electricity Bill-2025, the Seed Bill-2025, the VB-G RAM G Act-2025, restoration of the old pension scheme and implementation of minimum wages for workers, including scheme workers.The platform of agricultural workers’ unions and the NREGA Sangharsh Morcha (NSM) supported and participated in protest demonstrations across the country.“SKM calls upon the people to resist all the new attacks launched by the BJP government on the farmers, the workers and common people,” the statement said.The SKM said the Electricity Bill would raise power tariffs for farmers and domestic users and impose peak-hour charges and smart meters. “SKM is demanding 'No to Smart Meters' and 300 units of free electricity to all as is also being promised in BJP election campaigns,” the statement said.It also opposed the Viksit Bharat-Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) Act, alleging that it would depose the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), and objected to the new Seed Bill, stating it would lead to black-marketing of seeds.The SKM opposed free trade agreements, calling them a blueprint of “economic colonisation” through the denial of minimum wages to workers, minimum support price (MSP) to farmers and the right to employment to unemployed youth.“The Modi government has surrendered the sovereignty and the self-reliance of India to the United States of America,” the SKM alleged.“SKM appeals to all farmers to join en masse in the protest demonstration, burn the effigies of Narendra Modi and Donald Trump and copies of the free trade agreements in solidarity with industrial workers and against all the anti-people, pro-corporate government policies,” it said.Insurance sector workers have also protested against the government’s decision to allow up to 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) in the sector and the implementation of new labour codes.“Services in electricity, banking, insurance, transport, health, education, gas and water supply will be affected due to the nationwide strike call on February 12,” All India Trade Union Congress General Secretary Amarjeet Kaur told PTI.Public sector banks and insurance offices, state transport services in select states, government offices and public sector units, industrial and manufacturing hubs, coal, steel and other core sectors, mining and gas pipeline operations, and rural employment works under MGNREGA in protest areas are expected to see the impact of the agitation.However, all bank unions will not participate in the strike as their united front had already observed a strike on January 27. Bank workers’ unions such as AIBEA, AIBOA and BEFI participated in the protest.Hospitals, ambulance and emergency health services are expected to remain operational. Metro services are to function subject to local administration decisions.Private offices, IT companies, schools and colleges are likely to remain open depending on state-wise decisions. Essential supply services such as milk and pharmacies are also expected to function.",Trade unions said nearly 30 crore workers from various sectors were likely to participate in the agitation.

"Not just HCs, CJI nudges Supreme Court judges on delayed verdicts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/not-just-hcs-cji-nudges-supreme-court-judges-on-delayed-verdicts/articleshow/128235297.cms,"‘Justice Delayed Is Justice Destroyed’: CJI Kant Calls High Courts Key Guardians Of Citizens’ Rights

NEW DELHI: Amid mounting unease of SC over the practice of judges inordinately delaying pronouncing verdicts reserved by them, a two-judge bench of apex court has set Thursday as the day to deliver a verdict it reserved a year and two months ago.SC had recently criticised HC judges who reserve verdict and forget to pronounce their decisions, terming it an ailment in justice system.An SC bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Manoj Misra on Dec 3, 2024 reserved verdict in the case “B Prashanth Hegde vs State Bank of India and Another” after hearing senior advocate A M Singhvi for appellant and additional solicitor general N Venkataraman. The case centred on failure to repay alleged bank dues of Rs 300cr and a counter-claim challenging the IBC proceedings. It might be a coincidence that the case showed movement soon after an SC bench led by CJI Surya Kant on Feb 3 criticised Jharkhand HC judge Rongon Mukhopadhyay for keeping judgments reserved for years.Terming it as “challenge” and an “ailment of the justice delivery system,” the CJI said such delays “must be cured and not allowed to infect the system”.When contacted for comments on his concerns over the judgment being kept reserved for long, the CJI office said, “the CJI is aware of the issue and that he is contemplating consultation with his colleagues for issuance of a general internal guidelines for prompt delivery of judgments.Overwhelming majority of judges in the SC do not keep judgments reserved for a long period. Compared to the HCs, the SC judges must get a little more time to contemplate and deliberate before delivering judgments as these become the law of the land. ”On inquiry with the SC registry, TOI learnt that Justice Misra had agreed to author the judgment on behalf of the bench and that it is pending with him for more than one year. CJI Kant had earlier said the best way to avoid reserving decisions in too many cases is to dictate the orders in the courtroom immediately after hearing the two sides to a litigation.CJI, in most cases, dictates judgments in the courtroom. Because of the pressure of administrative work that eats into his judicial time, the bench led by the CJI sits beyond the scheduled business hours to compensate the litigants and complete the day’s work, sources said.In 2001, the SC in Anil Rai case flagged the practice of some HC judges reserving verdicts and then failing to pronounce them, or issuing only the operative portions of the verdict with a promise to provide detailed reasons later — a commitment which was often observed in the breach.SC had ruled that if the judgment remained reserved for over six months, the litigants could make an application to the CJ concerned for listing the case for fresh hearing before another bench. SC could lay down guidelines for HCs, but it has done little to tackle similar delays in SC. Justice A S Oka, close to his retirement last year, had delivered the judgment on a long-pending dispute between two ISKCON factions after keeping it reserved for almost a year.","A two-judge bench of apex court has set thursday as the day to deliver a verdict it reserved a year and two months ago.

Andrabi UAPA case stuck over jurisdiction concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/andrabi-uapa-case-stuck-over-jurisdiction-concerns/articleshow/128235212.cms,"‘Does judgment include sentencing?’

NEW DELHI: Arguments on sentencing of Kashmiri separatist Aasiya Andrabi and her two associates, convicted last month under UAPA for conspiring to wage war against India and for membership of a terrorist outfit, could not begin on Wednesday as the question of jurisdiction has not yet been decided.Andrabi, founder of women separatist organisation Dukhtaraan-e-Millat, and her aides Sofi Fehmeeda and Nahida Nasreen were arrested by NIA in a 2018 case and held guilty on Jan 14 by additional sessions judge Chanderjit Singh.However, the sentencing remains stalled pending clarity on jurisdiction.The impasse traces back to Nov 2025, when judge Singh was transfersred from NIA court to Karkardooma family courts. Since the verdict in the case had already been reserved, he retained the file and convicted the trio last month.The confusion over sentencing, however, resurfaced after the matter was transferred back to Singh by NIA court judge Prashant Sharma, who had earlier held that the judge delivering the conviction should also decide the quantum of punishment. Singh had been hearing the matter since 2024 before his transfer.However, since the case falls within the NIA court’s jurisdiction, his present posting as a family court judge has added to the procedural complexity. The HC had held in another case that where a sessions case had been heard in its entirety, the predecessor judge was “duty-bound to pronounce the judgment”. The next hearing on Feb 17, 2026 will determine how to further proceed on the matter.Arguments on sentencing in Aasiya Andrabi’s criminal conspiracy case was put off as a Delhi court must first decide if judgment passed on Jan 14 includes both conviction and sentencing. The judge who convicted her was transferred, causing deadlock over who should pass the sentence.","‘does judgment include sentencing?’ asks delhi court.

SC puts on hold advocate's 2 talaq-e-hasan attempts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-puts-on-hold-advocates-2-talaq-e-hasan-attempts/articleshow/128229928.cms,"NEW DELHI: In an unprecedented step, Supreme Court put on hold an advocate's two attempts to divorce his wife through talaq-e-hasan and sent them to mediation for an amicable settlement of their marital dispute even though the man had remarried after the first talaq-e-hasan in 2022.Amid duelling interpretations of Shariat, Muslim personal law and its religious connotations between senior advocates Rizwan Ahmed - appearing for the woman, Benazeer Heena - and M R Shamshad - appearing for the man, Yusuf Naqi - a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi persuaded the parties to go for mediation.The advocate had first given talaq-e-hasan (pronouncement of talaq three times, each separated from the other by a month) first in 2022. However, on a petition by Heena where she challenged the validity of talaq-e-hasan, which she said left Muslim women destitute as there was no provision for maintenance, SC noted that it was handed over to her thro-ugh her husband's counsel.Heena said she could not remarry as she did not have a valid divorce under Muslim personal law. When Shamshad said his client had given her a valid divorce, Ahmed contested this and termed the second round illegal.The bench said, ""There is an urgent and dire necessity to refer parties to mediation for amicable resolution of their marital disputes and whether talaq-e-hasan was given validly and to explore any alternative solution.""It referred the parties for mediation before former SC judge Kurian Joseph, who incidentally was with the majority verdict by a five-judge Constitution bench that declared instant triple talaq unconstitutional in the Shayara Bano case on Aug 22, 2017.In another petition filed by Delhi-based Aasma questioning the validity of talaq-e-hasan given to her, the bench found that her husband, Mohd Anshar, had not responded to the court's notice seeking a response. It directed the SHO of Karawal Nagar to produce Anshar at the next hearing.After SC passed the two orders, Shamshad said it should not give the impression that talaq-e-hasan was an invalid mode of divorce among Muslims. The bench said it had expressed no opinion on the validity of talaq-e-hasan and that it was facilitating exploration of the possibility of an amicable settlement.",Supreme court put on hold an advocate's two attempts to divorce his wife.

What explains the Left's right turn?

Anti-incumbency

Rise of saffron wave

The ‘watershed’ local body polls

Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan condemned his Assam counterpart Himanta Biswa Sarma's ""point-blank"" video, terming it ""communal hate mongering"". However, it was only weeks ago when he himself remained at the center of a controversy for supporting a communal statement in his state.Kerala's Left has, for decades, projected itself as an ideological outlier in Indian politics — secular, class-driven, and resistant to the communal polarisation that has reshaped much of the country.Alternating in power with the Congress-led UDF, the CPM-led LDF built its dominance on welfare politics, strong grassroots organisation, and a firm rejection of identity-based mobilisation. Yet, as the state heads toward another high-stakes electoral cycle, that self-image appears increasingly strained.Recent years have seen the Left navigating a far more complex political terrain.Anti-incumbency pressures after two consecutive terms, the steady expansion of the BJP’s footprint, and shifting demographic and electoral calculations have forced recalibration. In response, the LDF’s politics has begun to display sharper edges — marked by strategic outreach to majority sentiment, selective engagement with religious institutions and a willingness to deploy rhetoric it once distanced itself from.It is against this backdrop that a spate of communally charged statements and controversies has moved to the centre of Kerala’s political discourse. What was once confined to accusations of covert alliances and backroom deals has now acquired a distinctly communal framing, raising questions about whether the Left is merely reacting to new political threats — or consciously adopting elements of the very playbook it long criticised.Jamaat-e-Islaami Hind has once again found itself at the centre of a political storm in Kerala — but this time, the sharper focus is on the surge of communal rhetoric that has accompanied the controversy.The socio-Islamic organisation was dragged into a political spat after the CPM and the BJP accused the Congress-led UDF of accepting support from Jamaat. While Jamaat’s political wing, the Welfare Party of India, does not wield significant electoral power, it maintains a presence across social, religious and educational institutions — a footprint that often becomes politically contentious.What has amplified the row, however, is the language used in attacking the alleged association. CPM leader AK Balan made a communally charged statement while criticising the UDF, warning that if the Congress alliance came to power, Jamaat would control the state’s home ministry and that it could lead to a repetition of incidents like the Marad riots of 2002-03. The reference to a past episode of communal violence immediately escalated tensions and sharpened political divides.Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan did not shy away from voicing his support for Balan’s remarks. But the fallout was swift. The CPM’s top leadership later attempted damage control, describing Balan’s remarks as his “personal view” after the party faced criticism for rhetoric that opponents said it echoed ""Sangh Parivar"" campaign.The Congress seized on that line of attack. “What the CM has said is a kind of communalism that even Sangh Parivar does not express,"" AICC general secretary KC Venugopal said , framing the controversy as a troubling departure from the CPM’s professed secular stance.The CPM pushed back, arguing that the debate was being deliberately mischaracterised. Party leader MV Govindan said BJP and Sangh Parivar organisations were trying to present CPM’s criticism of the RSS as an attack on Hindu believers. ""Society should understand that criticism against religious fundamentalists is not against religion,"" he said, adding that Mahatma Gandhi was a true believer and Nathuram Godse was a religious fanatic.""How can one argue that criticism against a religious fanatic is criticism against religion? CPM will continue to expose this contradiction and work among people to expose and oppose both minority and majority communal extremists,"" Govindan said.Despite defending its ideological position, the CPM eventually distanced itself from Balan’s original statement, reiterating that it reflected his “personal view.”Even as the Left sharpened its outreach to the majority community, it simultaneously moved to reinforce ties with influential Muslim bodies, most notably Samastha, signalling a calibrated dual-track political strategy.The nomination of Samastha Mushawara member Ummer Faizi Mukkam—known both for his proximity to the Left and his vocal criticism of the IUML—to the reconstituted Kerala State Waqf Board underscored this approach.Faizi’s inclusion, despite past controversies and objections from pro-IUML quarters within Samastha, was widely read as an attempt to strengthen engagement with sections of the influential Islamic scholars’ body that are either sympathetic to or seeking distance from the IUML.Communist CM Pinarayi Vijayan, far-right UP CM Yogi Adityanath’s message and a Hindu event - Kerala witnessed it all last year.The Left government in Kerala organised Global Ayyappa Sangamam. But why did it stand out? As the name suggests, the event is meant for Ayyappa devotees. Sabarimala temple, which remains controversial, earlier for restricted women's entry, and now for gold theft, is devoted to the Hindu deity Ayyappa. Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) manages the temple and organises Global Ayyappa Sangamam. However, last year, the CPM government’s move to “assist” TDB in organising the Ayyappa event raised a lot of eyebrows.Why?The Left government was upfront in supporting the SC 2018 verdict allowing the entry of women of all ages in the Sabarimala temple. It even provided police protection to the two women of menstruating age who entered the Ayyappa temple.Protests erupted. Those who opposed the move- Sabarimala Karma Samtihi and BJP among others- took to the streets.BJP even accused the Left government of using the SC verdict to “diminish the prominence of the Sabarimala temple.”BJP and RSS both maintained the stance that while they supported “equal rights for men and women to worship in all temples”, they also affirmed that “unique rituals and beliefs should be protected"".By 2019, the Left government took a U-turn. It felt that aggressively facilitating women’s entry, as the year before, could again trigger unrest and large-scale protests during the pilgrimage season. Moreover, the party leadership concluded that pushing the issue could be politically costly, especially after past backlash and violence.As a result, Left’s move to organise the Ayyappa event is seen as nothing but a “majority appeasement” move, at least by the opposition.In fact, CPM received backing for the Sangamam from influential community organisations, including the Nair Service Society (NSS)—which led the 2018 agitation against the Vijayan government—as well as the SNDP, KPMS and the Malayaraya Mahasabha.The Sabarimala gold theft case is another major corruption charge that the Left has been accused of. The case revolves around the alleged pilferage and misuse of gold from the inner shrine of the Sabarimala Ayyappa Temple. Moreover, the opposition has alleged that investigative lapses have allowed key accused to walk out on bail — an outcome the Congress says marks another low for the Left government in Kerala.Picture this: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan and Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor sharing a stage to mark the largest private investment in a communist state, after a slew of opposition by the locals citing environmental concerns.It was 2015. The UDF government in Kerala laid the foundation stone for the Vizhinjam port. 'Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone' (APSEZ) signed the agreement with Kerala to build the port and operate it for 60 years.LDF, which was in opposition then, had rejected what it called a ‘sell-out’ PPP framework that favoured the sole bidder, Adani Ports and SEZ.Cut to 2025. LDF government, led by CM Pinarayi Vijayan shared the stage with Gautam Adani to congratulate for the “excellent execution of this mission”.However, this change in stance wasn’t just theatrics. On the ground, too, the shift was unmistakable.Despite sustained protests by fisherfolk and environmental groups, the LDF government stood firmly behind the project.Legal challenges against the port were contested in court, but construction was allowed to proceed.Prolonged protests, including a 140-day agitation in 2022, were met with police action and criminal cases against protest leaders.Claims of coastal erosion, displacement and loss of livelihood were rejected by the government, which backed the developer’s compliance reports and pushed the project forward, even as local opposition continued.The CPM went beyond backing the project and turned its fire on the protesters themselves. Through its mouthpiece, the party branded the Vizhinjam agitation as violent, motivated by vested interests, and led by forces seeking to destabilise the region.Protesters were accused of attacking police and the media, vandalising equipment, and defying court orders, even as the government refused to pause construction.The paper insisted that most demands had already been conceded, ruled out any rethink of the project, and portrayed protest leaders as irresponsible actors prolonging unrest despite talks and assurances—effectively shifting blame from the project to those resisting it.And that’s how a communist state got its largest ever private investment.Anti-incumbency has historically been a decisive factor in Kerala politics, and the numbers from past assembly elections make clear why the Left Front is apprehensive ahead of 2026.Looking at the electoral record, the LDF has experienced sharp swings after being in power: in 2001, it won only 41 seats compared to the UDF’s 100, but bounced back to 102 in 2006 after a term out of office. Similar patterns recur in 2011, when the LDF’s seat count fell to 70 from 102, illustrating the electorate’s tendency to punish prolonged rule regardless of performance. These cycles show that voter fatigue and anti-incumbency are embedded in Kerala’s political DNA, particularly against fronts seeking consecutive terms.The concern is amplified by the LDF’s recent tenure. Having governed since 2016 and securing 94 seats in 2021, the Left is now eyeing for a third consecutive term, a period historically vulnerable to voter backlash. With past trends showing that even strong governments can be significantly reduced after two terms, anti-incumbency presents a major hurdle for the LDF as it seeks to retain power in 2026.Another major challenge confronting the Left in Kerala is the steady rise of the saffron wave, reflected clearly in the BJP’s expanding influence in the past two decades.The BJP finally opened its account in Kerala in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, winning its first-ever parliamentary seat in the state.The CPI(M) too was left with just one seat, secured as part of the INDIA bloc, but the result carried little sense of achievement for the Left. For a party that once commanded double-digit representation from Kerala, repeating a single-seat tally for the second consecutive general election highlighted not stability but a prolonged erosion of influence.Alongside the seat win, the NDA raised its vote share to 19.4 per cent from 15.6 per cent in 2019, signalling that the party’s support base had reached a level where it could no longer be dismissed as electorally marginal.The CPM, which had won 12 Lok Sabha seats in 2004, saw its tally fall to four in 2009 and five in 2014, before being reduced to just one seat in 2019—a position it failed to improve upon in the 2024 elections.The contrasting trajectories underline a shift in Kerala’s national-level political landscape, where the Left’s once-dominant presence has steadily weakened even as the BJP has begun converting vote share into representation.Local body polls painted another scary picture for the Left, reinforcing concerns about the growing saffron wave ahead of the 2026 assembly elections.Seen as a semi-final to the state polls, the results delivered a sharp setback to the governing LDF, cutting through its welfare claims and governance pitch and reducing it to its weakest grassroots performance in years.While the Congress-led UDF mounted a sweeping comeback across all tiers of local self-government, the BJP-led NDA expanded beyond its traditional confines, transforming Kerala’s familiar bipolar contest into an increasingly triangular one.The most dramatic rupture came in Thiruvananthapuram, where the BJP-led NDA ended the CPM’s three-decade grip on the city corporation. Emerging as the single-largest front with 50 of 100 wards—just one short of an absolute majority—the NDA pushed the LDF down to 29 seats, while the UDF nearly doubled its tally from 10 wards in 2020 to 19.The result, hailed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a watershed moment in Kerala politics, underscored how the saffron surge has moved from the periphery to the centre of the state’s political contest, posing a direct challenge to the Left’s long-standing dominance.Demographically, Hindus constitute 54.73% of Kerala’s population. Muslims account for 26.56% and Christians 18.38%, both remaining influential but more regionally concentrated.As the Left confronts shrinking margins and the rise of new competitors, especially in Hindu-majority regions, it has increasingly sought to complement its long-standing minority outreach with calibrated appeals to the majority community.","Jamaat-e-islaami hind has once again found itself at the centre of a political storm in kerala. This time, the sharper focus is on the surge of communal rhetoric that has accompanied the controversy. What was once confined to accusations of covert alliances and backroom deals has acquired a distinctly communal framing.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128202245,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1315252,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

She criticised the CM for advising women to remain indoors in the evenings instead of taking steps to improve the state’s law and order situation.She referred to a June 2025 bomb blast in Kaliganj that claimed a child’s life, noting that a TMC leader was arrested in connection with the incident. West Bengal is scheduled to head to the polls in the coming months.Responding to remarks by TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee, Sitharaman accused him of misleading the House by claiming that GST is levied on milk, stationery and education.She also rejected his assertion that GST is imposed even in death, clarifying that funeral services have never been taxed under the GST regime.The minister added that the Budget contains several proposals in which the West Bengal government can participate to advance the state’s interests.",Nirmala sitharaman hit out at west bengal cm mamata banerjee over the issue of law and order in the poll-bound state.

NEW DELHI: The Union home ministry has issued an order stating that all six stanzas of the national song ‘ Vande Mataram ’ — including the last four that were dropped by the Jawaharlal’s Nehru govt, allegedly to maintain the song’s ‘secular’ appeal — shall be sung at all official functions and other occasions.The home ministry order dated 06.02.2026 lays down the ‘official version ’ of the song — encapsulating all six stanzas of Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s original composition. “The duration for which the song shall be played or sung shall be 3 minutes and 10 seconds,” the order states while laying down the occasions on which ‘Vande Mataram’ shall be sung or played as well as the protocols to be observed in due honour of the national song.The MHA instructions on ‘Vande Mataram’ coincide with the celebration of 150th anniversary of the creation of the song.All members of the audience present when the national song is being played must stand in attention pose. However, this shall not be mandatory in cinema halls when Vande Mataram is being played as part of the film or during news reels “as a standing audience interferes with viewing of the film and can lead to disturbance of peace and disorder”.As per MHA’s instructions, the national song is to be played when the national flag is brought to a parade. It will also be played at all civilian award/honour ceremonies, official state functions as well as at events organised by the govt and graced by the President of India.

In a marching drill, there will be seven steps leading to start of the national song.In its instructions regarding singing of ‘Vande Mataram’, the MHA said it would be sung at all cultural events and occasions where the national flag is being hoisted. Also it may be sung upon the arrival and departure of the President of India at govt and public functions other than formal state events.All six stanzas of the national song, as per the official version, must be sung at such events, the MHA has instructed.Informal events attended by ministers may also witness group rendition of the song.> The morning school assemblies of all schools must incorporate group singing of the national song, as per MHA guidelines.",The home ministry order dated 06.02.2026 lays down the ‘official version ’ of the song.

Hardeep Puri Blasts Rahul Gandhi's 'Buffoonery' On Epstein Files

Epstein called me ‘2-faced’ as I wasn’t interested: Puri

NEW DELHI: Union petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Wednesday said during the eight years he spent in the US, he met convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein “only three to four times” as a private citizen, as part of a delegation of the Independent Commission on Multilateralism he was associated with after his retirement from the Indian Foreign Service, and had just one email exchange with him.Responding to allegations of leader of the opposition Rahul Gandhi and Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi in LS about his links with Epstein, Puri said the meetings took place before he joined the Union Cabinet in 2017, details of which were in the public domain.At a press conference, Puri said he had sent an email to LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman a day after meeting him in Nov 2014, detailing a “terrific opportunity for internet-based economic activities in India”, and Epstein was copied on that communication.“At least read why my name appears in it. I even sent a note to Rahul a day after he referred to the Epstein files during a brief interaction with me at the Constitution Day celebrations in the Central Hall of Parliament on Nov 26, 2025.

Assam final electoral roll shows drop in voters across 25 of 35 districts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assam-final-electoral-roll-shows-drop-in-voters-across-25-of-35-districts/articleshow/128234340.cms,"(ANI)

NEW DELHI: District-wise data of deletions made in the final electoral roll of Assam published on Tuesday, show a decline in the electorate of 25 of the state's 35 districts as compared to the draft roll.While Cachar district witnessed the maximum decline of electors in absolute terms, with a total 33,536 shaved off the draft list, Karimganj reported the maximum percentage of deletions, with 3.2% less electors as compared to the draft roll.As per data exclusively accessed by the TOI, Udalgiri and Darrang district had 2.7% electors struck off, while the deletions in Lakhimpur, Cachar and Kamrup Metro districts were around 2.4% each.Among the 10 districts where electors rose in number as compared to the draft list, Barpeta had the highest additions both in absolute (28,625) and percentage (3%) terms.Nagaon district now has the highest number of total electors at 15.5 lakh, followed by Cachar at 13.8 lakh. The districts with the smallest electorate are the tribal-dominated Dima Hasao, with less than 1.6 lakh electors ,and West Karbi Anglong with 2.3 lakh electors.Indicating the decisive role of women in choosing the next govt in Assam, female electors outnumber their male counterparts across 86 of the state's total 126 assembly constituencies, even though the overall sex ratio of the state's electorate (female voters per 1000 male voters) is 1000. Doom Dooma assembly constituency (AC) in Tinsukia district leads the way with a sex ratio of 1118, followed by Jalukbari AC in Kamrup Metro district at 1113 and Makum AC in Tinsukia at 1100. However, the sex ratio is most skewed against women in Algapur-Katlicherra AC in Hailakandi district at 910, followed by Chenga AC in Barpeta district at 918.As per the final electoral roll for Assam published on Tuesday after summary revision, the state's total electorate stands at around 2.5 crore after the deletion of 0.97% electors included the draft list. The final electorate, however, is higher than the state's 2.4 crore electorate in 2024 general elections.Unlike the special intensive revision (SIR) exercise undertaken in the other poll-bound states/UT of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Puducherry, summary revision does not involve filling up of enumeration forms or establishing a link with the electoral roll from the last SIR. However, the summary revision in Assam did include house-to-house verification of the electors.","District-wise data of deletions made in the final electoral roll of assam published on tuesday, show a decline in the electorate of 25 of the state's 35 districts.

NEW DELHI: In a significant ruling, the Delhi high court has granted bail to an accused charged under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), citing a violation of his fundamental constitutional rights regarding the timing of his production before a magistrate.The appellant, Harsh Pal Singh alias Rubal, was allegedly involved in an organized crime syndicate and faced charges under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, and the Arms Act. Justice Chandrasekharan Sudha delivered the judgment on February 10, 2026, setting aside a previous trial court order that had denied him bail.The core of the legal dispute centered on the timeline of the appellant's arrest and subsequent production in court. Singh was detained at Amritsar Airport on the night of September 25, 2025, while attempting to travel to Bangkok.He was subsequently handed over to the Delhi Police Special Cell and produced before a Special Court on September 27, 2025.The defense team led by, Advocate Rajani and Nishant Rana, argued that the total time he spent in custody before being presented to a magistrate exceeded the 24-hour limit mandated by Article 22 (2) of the Constitution and the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita.While the prosecution claimed Singh had been briefly interrogated and released on a notice to join the investigation the next day, the high court found these claims ""quite doubtful"". General Diary entries indicated that Singh’s belongings, including his passport and bag, were handed over to the Delhi team, who then left with him in a government vehicle, making a formal release unlikely.The court emphasized that the right to be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours is a peremptory constitutional mandate. Citing Supreme Court precedents, the court noted that any detention beyond this period without judicial authority renders the custody illegal.Despite the prosecution's concerns regarding the gravity of the offences and Singh’s perceived attempt to abscond by booking a flight shortly after receiving a police notice, the court maintained that procedural law must be strictly followed. Consequently, bail was granted on stringent conditions, including a personal bond of Rs two lakhs.","Delhi high court has granted bail to an accused charged under the maharashtra control of organised crime act (mcoca) harsh pal singh alias rubal was allegedly involved in an organized crime syndicate and faced charges under the bharatiya nyaya sanhita, 2023, and the arms act.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128214477,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-108816,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
