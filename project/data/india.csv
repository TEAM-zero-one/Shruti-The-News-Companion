NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Brajesh Pathak hailed the central government's Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), which he said helped to improve the water supply mechanism significantly in the country.Speaking at TOI's Water Summit 2025, the deputy CM said Uttar Pradesh made a major stride in the implementation of the scheme.Pathak highlighted how the increase in population led to water shortage and shed light on the ways Uttar Pradesh has been adopting to meet water demand.""When humans made progress, we tried moulding the environment as per our wishes. Humans would not have had to build reservoirs as natural reservoirs like rivers, waterfalls or rainwater fulfilled our daily needs. Then the population was less. But an increase in the population led to a rise in water consumption, melting of glaciers and reduction of rainwater in monsoons,"" Pathak said.The deputy CM thanked PM Modi for the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), saying the Prime Minister has made efforts to ensure on-ground implementation of JMM for the completion of a bigger goal.He said UP has ""done wonders in the implementation"" of JJM, adding ""we have witnessed the implementation of the scheme and he congratulated ""all officials linked to JJM and irrigation"".""Earlier houses had small water tanks for water storage, but PM Modi ensured the availability of fresh drinking water in every house. Uttar Pradesh has been number one in the effort. We are moving forward with a purpose,"" Pathak said.Claiming that the UP government, under CM Yogi Aadityanath, made unprecedented progress in JMM implementation, Pathak said: ""As of now, water supply is being ensured in 24,050 villages. Our connection has reached 2.36 crore houses, 37, 462 pump houses have been made. We have done a deep boring of 38,456 tubewells.""He said that the UP government has also given importance to an alternative source of energy.""Our team was aware of how would water be accessible in the absence of electricity. Therefore, the entire system is based on solar. We produce electricity, run our pump houses, supply water, and send extra electricity to the grid. This is a great effort under JJM,"" the minister said.",Up deputy chief minister brajesh pathak hailed the central government's jal jeevan mission.

TOI Water Summit 2025: Experts call for grassroots action on water crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/toi-water-summit-2025-experts-call-for-grassroots-action-on-water-crisis/articleshow/119313786.cms,"NEW DELHI: Key experts and policymakers came together at The Times of India Water Summit 2025 to discuss grassroots awareness and the role of behavioural change in ensuring access to safe drinking water . The discussions centred on the Jal Jeevan Mission , highlighting community-driven solutions for sustainable water management.Smriti Singh, State Programme Director of WaterAid UP, spoke about the critical role of community involvement in the success of the Jal Jeevan Mission. "" Water conservation is a concept that is deeply linked to behavioural change. It has to start at the household level,"" she said. Highlighting the challenges of implementation, she added, ""Ensuring access to safe drinking water requires women’s participation at the community level. Historically, women have had to travel long distances to fetch water, increasing their workload and affecting their livelihood opportunities. Community engagement is essential to overcoming these challenges.""She also cited successful grassroots initiatives, such as the development of village action plans and water security mapping. ""By involving men, women, and children in the planning process, we were able to identify water sources, assess their sustainability, and introduce measures like rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge,"" she explained.Environmentalist Ramveer Tanwar, popularly known as the 'Pond Man' of India, emphasised the role of youth in water conservation. ""If we don't act now, future generations will only inherit polluted water bodies. The youth must step up and take responsibility,"" he said. He recounted his initiative, ‘Selfie with Pond,’ which encouraged young professionals working in cities to reconnect with their village water bodies. ""We challenged youth to visit their ancestral villages, take a selfie with a pond, and share it on social media. Thousands participated, realising the dire condition of these water bodies,"" he added.Brijraj Singh Yadav, IAS, Executive Director of S.W.S.M. (UP), highlighted the increasing stress on water resources due to rising consumption. ""Water is vital not just for drinking but also for irrigation and industry. As our population grows, so does our demand, making conservation even more urgent,"" he noted. Addressing the declining condition of traditional water bodies, he said, ""Many ponds have deteriorated over the last decade, turning into garbage dumps. We must take urgent measures to restore them before the damage becomes irreversible.""Venkatesh Dutta, Head of the Department of Environmental Science at Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Lucknow, underscored the necessity of a mindset shift in both rural and urban areas. ""We need to rethink how we manage water. Villages traditionally relied on ponds and wells, but urbanisation has altered these dynamics. We must implement structured recharge systems and geo-tagging to ensure sustainability. In cities, water is either drained into sewer systems or wasted. We need to adopt a circular approach—reuse, conserve, and return water to nature in its purest form. Pricing water appropriately could also drive conservation, as clean water is costlier than petrol,"" he explained.Radha Krishna Tripathi, Senior Media Advisor at S.W.S.M. (UP), discussed the role of the media in spreading awareness about water conservation. ""Every city has rivers and water bodies that are often neglected or misidentified as drains. Recognising their value is the first step toward conservation,"" he said. He stressed the importance of educating rural and urban populations about water quality and management. ""For decades, many villages lacked access to clean water. Now, as we introduce chlorinated water, it takes time for people to understand its benefits. Behavioural changes don’t happen overnight. Under the Jal Jeevan Mission, we are working at the grassroots level to promote awareness and community participation,"" he added.","Key experts and policymakers came together at the times of india water summit 2025 to discuss grassroots awareness.

He noted that these technologies have helped improve water quality and ensure effective wastewater treatment, particularly during large-scale events like the Maha Kumbh.Discussing the Jal Jeevan Mission , which aims to provide tap water to every rural household, he said, “When the mission was launched, UP had only 1.96% tap water coverage in rural homes. Today, we have made significant progress, and the state is even in contention for a national award.”He also addressed major challenges, including arsenic and fluoride contamination in Bundelkhand and Gorakhpur, which previously caused high fatalities. Improved planning and solar-powered water supply schemes, he said, have significantly improved the situation. “By integrating solar energy, we are not only reducing electricity costs but also cutting down carbon emissions,” he noted.Srivastava further pointed out that improved water access has enhanced public health, boosted school enrolment rates, and raised the overall quality of life, especially for women. A streamlined online payment system for contractors, he added, has also ensured faster project execution.Looking ahead, he stressed the need for continuous innovation and active community participation to prevent water misuse and sustain conservation efforts.","Anurag shrivastava, additional chief secretary, namami gange and rural water resources department, emphasised that strengthening water governance in uttar pradesh requires policy innovation and technology.

TOI Water Summit 2025: Experts weigh in on need for multi-pronged approach to ensuring safe water access,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/toi-water-summit-2025-experts-weigh-in-on-need-for-multi-pronged-approach-to-ensuring-safe-water-access/articleshow/119313279.cms,"Speaking at the TOI’s 2025 Water Summit, Experts and policymakers underscored the need for a multi-pronged approach to ensuring safe water access at the “Water Sanitation & Public Health – Safe Water for All” panel discussion. The session, moderated by Daksh Sethi, Founder of Guby Rogers & The Wolf Media Co., brought together key voices from government, research, and civil society to discuss challenges and solutions.The panel featured Heera Lal, IAS, State Nodal Officer, Prime Minister Agriculture Irrigation Scheme; Divyendu Kumar Singh, Unit Coordinator (Technical), S.W.S.M. (UP); Prashansha Gupta, CEO, Institute for Water & Climate Initiatives; and Mr Hari Prakash Haihyvanshi, Deputy Programme Manager, Water & Wastewater, CSE India.Prashansha Gupta highlighted gaps in water supply infrastructure, particularly in high-altitude regions where pipeline maintenance remains a challenge. She advocated for community ownership and education to ensure efficient water use and reduce wastage. “A well-built system is only as good as its users,” she noted, emphasising the importance of solar-powered water pumping stations as a sustainable alternative.Divyendu Kumar Singh provided insights into Jal Jeevan Mission , launched in 2019 to provide tap water connections in rural India. He detailed Uttar Pradesh’s progress, citing the laying of 51,000 km of pipelines, connecting 48,000 villages to the network, and certifying 24,000 villages as ‘Har Ghar Jal’ (Every Home with Water). He also highlighted the adoption of solar energy for water supply schemes, stating that 900 MW of solar panels have been installed across 33,000 schemes, reducing operational costs and ensuring sustainability.While infrastructure is crucial, experts agreed that sustainability depends on community participation. Ms Gupta stressed that awareness campaigns, especially targeting children and social media, could drive a shift in water conservation practices. “The mindset needs to change. If people don't value water, no system will work efficiently in the long run,” she added.Heera Lal called for rethinking large-scale water storage and instead prioritising localised conservation efforts. Citing research from IIT Kanpur, he said, “Big dams are no longer the solution. Small-scale groundwater recharge and rainwater harvesting must be prioritised.”The discussion concluded with a consensus that a combination of infrastructure, policy innovation, and public awareness is critical to addressing India’s water challenges. Sustained government investment, solar-powered solutions, and community-led conservation efforts will be key to securing safe and accessible water for all.","Experts and policymakers underscored the need for a multi-pronged approach to ensuring safe water access at the ‘water sanitation & public health – safe water for all’ panel discussion.

Muskan Rastogi , accused of murdering and dismembering her husband, Saurabh Rajput, spent her first night in Chaudhary Charan Singh district jail in extreme distress, as per reports. She was placed in the women’s barrack while her lover and co-accused, Sahil Shukla, was lodged separately in the men’s section.According to senior jail superintendent Viresh Raj Sharma, Muskan remained completely silent upon arrival and refused to eat. Jail sources told news agency PTI that Muskan cried throughout the night. Both accused had reportedly requested to be housed in adjacent barracks, but their request was denied.Also read: How Muskan lured lover Sahil to murder ex-merchant navy officer Saurabh Rajput ""Muskan remained silent and did not interact with anyone. She also did not eat the provided food,"" Sharma said.Earlier on Wednesday, Muskan and Sahil were presented in the court of the chief judicial magistrate and remanded to 14-day judicial custody. Their court appearance turned chaotic when a group of enraged lawyers physically assaulted them outside the courtroom. Sahil's clothes were torn in the scuffle before police managed to intervene and escort them to safety.The dismembered body of Saurabh Rajput, which was found encased in cement inside a blue drum, was cremated late Wednesday evening after undergoing a post-mortem examination.Investigations revealed that Muskan and Sahil had a long-standing relationship, having reconnected in 2019 through a WhatsApp group of former schoolmates. Muskan, who married Saurabh in 2016, allegedly saw him as an obstacle to her future with Sahil, leading to the murder plot.Also read: Drugged, beheaded, tricked with fake snapchats; how Muskan, his lover killed ex-merchant navy officer Saurabh, a former Merchant Navy officer, returned from London on February 24 to celebrate Muskan’s birthday, unaware of the gruesome fate awaiting him.

The couple then stabbed him to death before dismembering his body in an attempt to dispose of the evidence.They initially planned to discard the body parts in different locations but later opted to seal them inside a plastic drum filled with cement and sand. Before executing their plan, Muskan ensured her six-year-old daughter was sent to her grandmother’s house.After the murder, the couple travelled to Himachal Pradesh, attempting to evade suspicion. However, upon their return to Meerut on March 17, Saurabh’s family lodged a missing person complaint, leading to police action.

NEW DELHI: A fire that broke out in the residential bungalow of a Delhi high court judge resulted in recovery of a huge pile of cash, sending shock waves in judicial corridors and forcing the Supreme Court collegium led by CJI Sanjiv Khanna to decide to transfer him to another HC.When the fire broke out, Justice Yashwant Varma was not in town and his family members called the fire brigade and police. After the fire was doused, first responders found a huge amount of cash inside a room, leading to official entries being made about the recovery of what appeared to be unaccounted money.The local cops informed their seniors who briefed the brass about the accidental discovery. Soon, the news reached the higher-ups in the govt, who, in turn, informed the CJI about the hoard. CJI Khanna took a very serious view and immediately called for a collegium meeting.Also read : Who is Justice Yashwant Varma, the Delhi HC Judge transferred after cash recovery The collegium was unanimous that Justice Varma needed to be transferred immediately. He has been transferred to his parent HC, Allahabad HC. He had moved from there to Delhi HC in Oct 2021.However, some members of the five-judge collegium felt such a serious incident, if let off with a transfer, would not only tarnish the judiciary's image but also erode trust in the institution. They said Justice Varma should be asked to resign and if he declined, an in-house inquiry should be initiated by the CJI, as the first step towards his removal by Parliament.As per the in-house procedure devised by SC in 1999 to deal with allegations of corruption, wrongdoing or impropriety against constitutional court judges, CJI on receipt of a complaint, seeks response of the judge.He can set up the in-house probe panel comprising an SC judge and chief justices of two HCs in case he is not satisfied with the response or concludes that the matter requires deeper probe.","A fire that broke out in the residential bungalow of a delhi high court judge resulted in recovery of a huge pile of cash.

NEW DELHI: As hesitant Muskan sat on the chest of her unconscious husband, her lover Sahil handed her a knife and showed her how to wield it. ""You have to stab him in the heart three times,"" he instructed her with a promise of a new life after all this.Sahil, along with his lover Muskan Rastogi, stands accused of the murder of Muskan's husband, former Merchant Navy officer Saurabh Rajput.Sahil's room offered a glimpse into his dark and disturbing psyche. A dimly lit space with broken walls, filled with satanic symbols, cigarette boxes, and artwork depicting drug consumption. The victim's family believe that Sahil’s obsession with the occult played a role in the murder, with Saurabh Rajput’s mother, Renu Devi, claiming that her son was killed as part of a tantric ritual.In Sahil's room a bed sheet covered the window, and a sofa stood against the wall. Among the graffiti was a message: ""You can't trip with us."" The room had liquor cans scattered.On March 4, Rajput was allegedly drugged, stabbed, dismembered, and his remains sealed inside a cement-filled drum. Muskan and Sahil then embarked on a vacation to Himachal Pradesh, using Saurabh’s phone to mislead his family. The crime was discovered two weeks later when Muskan finally confessed to her parents, who then informed the police.Police sources told news agency PTI suggest that Sahil exercised psychological control over Muskan, isolating her from her six-year-old daughter and turning her into an addict. Muskan's parents accused him of trapping her in his web of superstitions. Neighbours also recalled his eerie behaviour—wearing kurtas with 'Mahakal' inscriptions, feeding stray cats, and keeping his room shrouded in darkness. Sketches of ominous figures adorned his walls, reinforcing his unsettling presence.""Sahil's occult practices dominated Muskaan's mind in such a way that she started keeping her six-year-old daughter away. Sahil had made Muskaan an addict and completely superstitious,"" the victim's mother said.Muskan, in her statement to police, admitted that Sahil coerced her into committing the murder. He allegedly told her, ""You have to kill Saurabh if we are to start a new life."" On the night of the crime, he directed Muskan to sit on Saurabh’s chest before handing her a knife. When she hesitated, he guided her hand to stab her unconscious husband three times in the heart.""Sahil got Muskan to kill her husband. First, he made her sit on Saurabh's chest. Then he brought a knife from the kitchen, showed her how to wield it and directed her to insert the knife in Saurabh's heart thrice,"" the source told PTI.Investigations also revealed that Muskan manipulated Sahil by creating a fake Snapchat ID impersonating his deceased mother. Through this, she convinced him that his mother wanted Saurabh dead.Investigators uncovered that Muskan and Sahil had reconnected in 2019 through a school WhatsApp group, reigniting an old relationship. By November 2023, Muskan had allegedly begun plotting Saurabh’s murder, PTI reported. Before his return from London in February, she purchased sedatives and knives under the guise of needing them to cut chicken. She also attempted to find a location to dispose of the body.SP City Ayush Vikram Singh revealed that Saurabh had been estranged from his family since marrying Muskan, which she believed would help cover up his disappearance. Ultimately, her plan failed, and both she and Sahil now face trial for a crime that investigators say was as gruesome as it was methodically planned.","Sahil, along with his lover muskan rastogi, stands accused of the murder of muskan's husband, former merchant navy officer saurabh rajput.

NEW DELHI: Is Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar targeting opposition leader Rabri Devi with a purpose? Twice in the space of 15 days, Nitish Kumar has mocked Rabri Devi reminding her of the circumstances under which the RJD leader was made the chief minister of the state in 1997.On Thursday, when Rabri Devi, along with other opposition members in the legislative council, targeted Nitish Kumar over the law and order situation in the state, the Bihar chief minister's counter was sharp and personal.""Her husband (Lalu Prasad) made her the chief minister when he was placed under suspension,"" Nitish said referring to Lalu Prasad's move to make Rabri Devi the chief minister after he was forced to resign from the post following an arrest warrant in a fodder scam case.Rabri Devi, a homemaker-turned-politician who is now the leader of the opposition in the Council, rose to register her protest, asserting that she could speak of achievements of her eight-year-long tenure as the chief minister.Nitish Kumar then ticked her off with the Magahi phrase ""(you stay out of this. You know nothing about these matters)"".This was the second time that Nitish Kumar had singled out Rabri Devi on the issue and made a mention of how and why Rabri Devi was made the chief minister.Earlier on March 7, during a heated debate over plight of women under the NDA government, Nitish had unleashed a broadside against the RJD in general and Rabri Devi in particular.The Bihar chief minister surprised many with his choice of words to refer to former chief ministers Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi.""Jab iske husband doob gaye to apni wife ko bana diya (When her husband began to sink, he installed his wife (in the CM's post))"", Nitish had said.So, why is Nitish Kumar harping on what happened 28 years ago?

She allegedly used her brother’s phone to create fake Snapchat accounts, deceiving Sahil into believing his deceased mother was speaking to him from the afterlife and demanding a sacrifice.Muskan’s mother, Kavita, had previously told police that, ""Saurabh was mad for my daughter.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday took a sharp jibe at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi while speaking in the Rajya Sabha on counter-terrorism operations and development in Jammu and Kashmir under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government.With a 'Kala Chashma' (black glasses) remark, Amit Shah accused Rahul Gandhi of refusing to acknowledge the development work done by the Modi government . The home minister said, ""If someone is sitting with black glasses on, how is it possible to show them the development?""During his speech, Shah said, ""They ask us — 'What happened after the abrogation of Article 370 ?' Saheb, development can only be seen by those with open hearts and clear vision. Those who sit with black glasses on and their eyes closed cannot see the progress in Jammu and Kashmir.""The home minister, referencing Rahul Gandhi's 2023 statement about his Bharat Jodo Yatra in Kashmir, said, ""He went to Kashmir, played Holi of snow, and then claimed he saw terrorists there."""" (If a terrorist is in your mind, he will appear in your dreams as well as in Kashmir), he added.""Whenever we see a terrorist, we shoot him between the eyes,"" Shah said, emphasizing the Modi government’s zero-tolerance policy on terrorism.Shah was referring to Rahul Gandhi's 2023 remarks at Cambridge University, where Gandhi recalled facing terrorists during the Bharat Jodo Yatra.Rahul had said that security forces in Kashmir advised him not to walk in the region due to fears of terror attacks.During the walk, an unknown man allegedly approached him, pointed toward some nearby individuals, and revealed that they were terrorists.""I thought I was in trouble because, in that situation, terrorists would kill me. But they did nothing because this is the power of listening,"" Rahul Gandhi had said.Shah, while responding to a debate in the Rajya Sabha on the functioning of the Home Ministry, asserted that the Narendra Modi government had fulfilled the vision of the Constitution’s architects by abrogating Article 370.""Article 370 was the foundation of separatism in Kashmir. However, I thank the architects of our Constitution for making it a temporary provision and incorporating a pathway for its abrogation within the Article itself,"" Shah said.He blamed vote bank politics and political rigidity for the prolonged existence of Article 370. ""On August 5, 2019, we finally abrogated Article 370, realizing the vision of our Constitution’s framers, who believed there should be no two heads of state, two constitutions, or two flags in one country,"" he stated.","Amit shah took a sharp jibe at congress leader rahul gandhi while speaking in the rajya sabha on counter-terrorism operations and development in jammu and kashmir.

NEW DELHI: Waqf (Amendment) Bill is expected to be introduced in Lok Sabha next week, inviting another round of confrontation between govt and opposition as both are firm on their stands as majority of opposition parties have opposed the legislation.Cabinet has approved the proposed amendments to the Waqf (Amendment) Bill incorporating the changes recently recommended by the parliamentary panel , paving the way for it to be tabled for discussion and passage.The bill was referred to JPC in Aug 2024 after it was introduced in Lok Sabha by minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju . The parliamentary panel adopted the report with majority vote while all 11 MPs from opposition parties in the panel had objected to the report. They had also moved dissent notes. The 655-page report was submitted to both Houses of Parliament earlier this month. The panel, while doing away with the “Waqf by User” provision, going forward, has allowed only existing “Registered Waqf by User” to be recognised as waqf. This will exclude the cases where the properties are under dispute or owned by govt. As per the report, the panel had supported inclusion of non-Muslims in waqf boards, which can go upto four and recommended transfer of dispute investigation authority from district collectors to senior state govt appointees.The state waqf boards will now include one member from the Muslim OBC community, ensuring broader representation. NDA, led by BJP is safely placed in Lok Sabha as a simple majority requires 272 votes to pass any legislation. NDA has 293 of 543 seats. In Jan, JPC approved 14 amendments proposed by NDA members, with TDP and JDU backing the revised version, signaling their alignment with BJP’s agenda. The proposed amendments introduce a series of changes designed to modernise the Waqf system. Among the key provisions are stricter regulations governing the registration and monitoring of Waqf properties.",Waqf (amendment) bill is expected to be introduced in lok sabha next week.

Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

I have always admired author Arthur Hailey. The meticulous research that has gone into each of his works never ceased to amaze me, be it Airport , Hotel , Money Changers , or Evening News . But Final Diagnosis remains my favourite.

Dr Pearson, an old doctor, who once helmed a research centre and Hospital, imparts wisdom to his young successor, Coleman, on the fleeting nature of time:

“You’ll sit on that chair and the phone will ring, and it’ll be the administrator—talking about budgets. Next minute, one of the lab staff will want to quit.” The old man smiled. That’s the way a day can go, and the next. Until you find a year has slipped by, and another. You will not read books, you will delegate research work to junior doctors.

And one day, you’ll realize that everything you once knew is outdated. If you want to avoid that, lock yourself in a room. Stay ahead.

I don’t remember whether Dr Coleman took Dr Pearson’s advice in the novel, but those words of Hailey stayed with me.

That’s how time passes us—like water cupped in our palms.

Our daily routines must go on, endless chores will demand our attention. Women, especially, bear this weight tenfold: ""My nails need trimming, I can't recall my last salon visit, my hospital check-up is overdue. It’s been a year since I had an uninterrupted conversation with my sister.”

Life is a constant battle between the vital few and the trivial many. The external world demands attention, but our internal calling whispers persistently. We work tirelessly, filling our days with ceaseless activity. But if we pause and ask whether we have moved closer to our dreams, the answer is often silent regret.

This paradox haunts employees during performance evaluations. ""I’ve been working non-stop,"" they say, only to hear, ""But the goals set at the beginning of the year remain unfulfilled."" Ironically, their managers, and their managers’ managers, all wonder the same—where did the time go?

Time management experts constantly remind us to carve out ‘sacred time’. Step away from the routine, and focus on what truly matters – at least 25% of our time has to be allotted for that. If we continue to say, “One day, when things settle, I will pursue my dream,” that day may never arrive. The time to act is now.

In the Mahabharata , the Pandavas lived an incognito year, shedding their royal identities in Virata Parva . Yudhishthira became a dice companion to the king, Draupadi a royal maid, Bhima a palace cook, Arjuna a transgender dance teacher, Nakula a horse trainer, and Sahadeva an astrologer. That year of reinvention deepened their wisdom, strengthening them for what lay ahead. When they left behind their identities and routine, they were able to connect with their inner selves more deeply.

Many renowned artists, thinkers, and scientists took time away from the everyday grind to devote themselves to their passion. Beethoven withdrew from social life to compose some of his greatest symphonies. Writers like Thoreau retreated into solitude to pen works that would later inspire generations.

Thiruvalluvar’s wisdom echoes through time:

Eydarkku Ariyadhu iyaindakkaal Annilaye

Seydarkku Ariya Seyal.

Hesitate not to prioritise the time which is rare,

And achieve tasks otherwise hard.

Are our days spent merely ticking off tasks on an endless list or in shaping something when looked back upon, brings fulfilment rather than regret?

Later, when the national anthem was played, he stood smiling and waving at bystanders.Kumar came under heavy opposition fire in both Houses of the state legislature for disrespecting the national anthem. His latest act led to much mirth and has given fodder to opposition parties, RJD and Congress, to exploit in the upcoming state polls, arguing he can't be given another term in view of his health condition.BJP, sources said, is confident of winning another term alongside JDU and LJP, but the party's worry is that Kumar's unexpected behaviour in the public glare has often given openings to opponents.The party, however, believes Kumar continues to be a valuable partner, and the memories of RJD's ""jungle raj"" will blunt any possibility of ""anti-incumbency"". Moreover, Kumar is credited with good governance and raising the bar in terms of performance which, BJP insiders feel, will help the alliance win another term.Of late, Kumar's behaviour has not followed a consistent pattern; there have been days when no mishaps took place and he appeared to be in control, like during his 'Pragati Yatra', even though he was in the public glare for several days.
