SC reinstates elected man convicted for gambling and fined Rs 200,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-reinstates-elected-man-convicted-for-gambling-and-fined-rs-200/articleshow/121174654.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday set aside a Karnataka HC’s decision to disqualify a man elected to the board of directors of a cooperative society by securing highest votes on the ground that his conviction under the state police Act for roadside gambling constituted a misconduct involving moral turpitude.One Hanumantharayappa YC along with some others were allegedly playing cards on the roadside when they were caught by police, which levied a fine of Rs 200 without any trial. The man later contested elections to a post in the Board of Directors of Govt Porcelain Factory Employees Housing Cooperative Society and won with highest votes. But his election was set aside by the Registrar of society, which was upheld by HC.Reversing the HC order and reinstating the petitioner in the Board of Directors of the cooperative society, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said, “In the very nature of things, we find it difficult that the misconduct attributed to the appellant involves moral turpitude. It is well known that the expression ‘moral turpitude’ is used in legal as well as societal parlance to describe a conduct which is inherently debased, vile, depraved or having some connection showing depravity.”Justice Kant said, “Every action against which one can raise an eyebrow may not necessarily involve moral turpitude. There are so many forms of playing cards. It is difficult to accept that every form of such playing would involve moral turpitude, especially when it is played as a mode of entertainment and recreation.”“In fact, in most parts of our country, playing cards without an element of gambling or betting is accepted as a Poorman’s source of entertainment. That apart, the appellant has not been found to be a habitual gambler,” the bench said.“Pertinently, the appellant has been elected to the Board of Directors of the Society with the highest votes. The consequential punishment of setting aside his election is highly disproportionate to the nature of misconduct said to have been committed by him,” it said while setting aside the judgment of the HC and orders of the authorities that disqualified him from holding office as a director of the society.",The supreme court on wednesday set aside a karnataka hc’s decision to disqualify a man elected to the board of directors of a cooperative society by securing highest votes.

BIJAPUR: CRPF DG G P Singh on Wednesday said Operation Blackforest — which demolished a Maoist ‘bastion’ in Karregutalu Hills (KGH) on Chhattisgarh-Telangana border — saw the force try out cave interventions for the first time, for the hills housed a network of 250 cave formations used by the Maoists as convenient hideouts, arms manufacturing units and to dump explosives and rations.“CRPF has generally been doing house or vehicle interventions. For the first time, we tried cave interventions. We had use a technique and make sure that we do not suffer casualties but neutralise the Maoists who may be there,” he told a press conference here.Singh said the forces also learnt that Naxals are now using beer bottles to make IEDs, which involve the minimum use of metal. “This now requires ingenuity in detecting IEDs and we will be revising our SOPs accordingly,” he said.Around 450 IEDs were detected and deactivated, though 15 IEDs that went off caused some injuries to force personnel. Singh said the force has been upgrading its IED detection equipment and technology to whatever is the latest available in the world.The CRPF chief said the recovery of a whopping 818 barrel grande launcher shells (BGLs) and 450 IEDs during the operation is significant as most of the Maoist attacks on security camps so far were done using BGLs. “Also, most of our personnel out on operations are killed or injured by IEDs,” said Singh.",Operation blackforest demolished a maoist ‘bastion’ in karregutalu hills (kgh) on chhattisgarh-telangana border.

The President's 14 questions

Prez:

Deemed assent concept

alien to constitutional scheme

NEW DELHI: In a sharp response to the April 8 verdict of Supreme Court, fixing deadlines for the governor and the President to decide on state Bills in the Tamil Nadu govt versus governor case, President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday asked the apex court how it could have given such a ruling when the Constitution had no such stipulations.Aware that a petition seeking review of the 415-page judgment by Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan would not yield positive outcome as it is ought be considered by the same bench in chamber, the Union govt invoked the President’s rarely used powers under Article 143(1) of the Constitution to seek SC’s opinion on a myriad contentious issues thrown up by the judgment, which it considers to be a clear overreach. Specifically, the President sought SC’s view on 14 questions.The President said Articles 200 and 201, applicable to governors and President respectively, “does not stipulate any time frame or procedure” to be followed by them while considering grant or refusal of assent to a bill passed by an assembly.“The exercise of constitutional discretion by governor and the President under Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution, respectively, are essentially governed by polycentric considerations, including federalism, uniformity of laws, integrity and security of the nation, doctrine of separation of powers,” she said, adding that she resorted to Article 143(1) in seeking the SC’s opinion as the apex court has in the past delivered conflicting judgments on the justiciability of presidential assent to bills .Article 200 mandates the governor, on presentation of a bill passed by an assembly, to grant assent or “as soon as possible” return the bill, excluding Money bills, for reconsideration by the House. The provision also lays down that the governor “shall not withhold assent” when the bill, after having been reconsidered, is sent to him .However, when a governor reserves a bill for consideration of the President, she under Article 201 is mandated to declare whether she assents to the bill or withholds it. The Constitution, however, does not prescribe a timeframe for the President to take a particular action once the bill , after having been reconsidered by the assembly, is presented to her again for assent.Without any express provision in the Constitution, the bench of Justices Pardiwala and Mahadevan had set a three-month deadline for the governor to either grant or return the bill to the House.If the bill is re-passed by the House and resent to him, then the governor must grant assent within a month, SC had ruled. It had also fixed a three-month deadline for the President to decide whether to grant or refuse assent to a bill.Critical of the SC using its Article 142 powers to rule that the 10 bills pending with the Tamil Nadu governor would be deemed to have been assented to, the President said, “The concept of a deemed assent of the President and the governor is alien to the constitutional scheme and fundamentally circumscribes the powers of the President and the governor”.The President also questioned the logic behind SC ruling that suggested that it would be better if the President seeks the opinion of the apex court in advance on whether to give assent to bills reserved for her by the governors.She said SC needs to give its opinion also contours and scope of provisions contained in Article 142 (which gives omnibus power to SC to do complete justice) “in the context of issues (assent to bills) which are occupied by either constitutional provisions or statutory provisions.In addition, she questioned the states increasingly using writ jurisdiction of the SC under Article 32 (which is meant for remedying violations of fundamental rights of citizens) instead of Article 131 (Centre-state dispute to be adjudicated only by the SC) to adjudicate issues “which by their nature are federal issues involving interpretation of the Constitution.”",President droupadi murmu on wednesday asked the apex court how it could have given such a ruling when the constitution had no such stipulations.

NEW DELHI: High court judges taking breaks “unnecessarily” and too often found a mention in Supreme Court bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh on Tuesday, which called for their performance audits.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said the top court was receiving several complaints against HC high court judges and it was a high time to assess the expenditure on them vis-a-vis their output.“There are some judges who work very hard but at the same time there are judges who are unnecessarily taking coffee breaks; this break or that break. We are hearing a lot of complaints about HC judges. This is a larger issue which needs to be looked into. What is the performance of HC judges? How much we are spending and what is the output? It’s high time we do a performance audit,” Justice Kant said.The remark came on a plea of four persons who had moved SC claiming Jharkhand HC had reserved its order on a criminal appeal against conviction and life sentence in 2022 but the judgment was not pronounced. Their counsel Fauzia Shakil said after SC’s nudge, HC on May 5 and 6 pronounced the verdicts, acquitting three of the four. The last case resulted in a split verdict and was referred to HC chief justice and the petitioner was granted bail.Shakil said that despite the verdicts, the acquitted persons were not released from jail and in the judgments, HC did not mention the date of reserving the orders.Taking exception, SC asked Jharkhand govt counsel to immediately release them before lunch break & posted the matter post 2pm. The counsel informed SC that the convicts were released. and it was due to the non-availability of release orders from the trial courts that delayed the process.The timeline prescribed earlier by this court for pronouncement of judgments will have to be adhered to along with mechanism which this court will propose, the bench said and directed the registry to collate data from HCs and posted the matter in July.",Supreme court bench of justices surya kant and n kotiswar singh said the top court was receiving several complaints against hc high court judges.

NEW DELHI: On Wednesday, the railways successfully ran its first “trial special train”, carrying soldiers on the strategically vital Katra-Qazigund section, in a move that signals how govt’s plan to run trains between J&K remains on track, unaffected by the ongoing Indo-Pak conflict .

The train left Katra around 10am and returned by 6pm, they added.The trial run gains importance considering the ongoing Indo-Pak conflict and Operation Sindoor. PM Narendra Modi was scheduled to inaugurate the section last month, but was postponed due to bad weather.Sources said the special train on trial carried soldiers who were on leave and stuck due to cancellations of flights to J&K. “The train operation was limited to only the Katra-Qazigund section. Normal train operation is on between Qazigund and Baramulla,” said an official.Earlier, the railways had carried out the trial run of special Vande Bharat trains between Katra and Srinagar, but never carried passengers in them.Wednesday’s successful trial run of the train with passengers also gains importance considering that it will be an additional connectivity to Kashmir and for faster movement of men and machineries.

Fake invoices

leading to GST credit facility misuse: HC

NEW DELHI: Flagging concerns over the misuse of a Central Goods and Services Tax Act provision, Delhi high court has fined a private firm for fraudulently claiming input tax credit (ITC) to escape paying full GST.“This court takes note, with some consternation, that such large-scale fraudulent availment of ITC may, if left unchecked, lead to severe damage to the GST framework itself,” HC said.The GST framework is meant to encourage legally entitled persons and businesses to avail of ITC and other similar facilities, said a bench of Justices Prathiba M Singh and Rajneesh Kumar Gupta in a recent order.HC noted Section 16 of CGST Act was being misused by companies and traders who first availed of the ITC by issuing fake invoices and, when slapped with a penalty by the department, rushed to court in writ jurisdiction.In essence, ITC allows a tax entity or person to claim credit & deduct from payable GST on purchase of goods and/or services used in the chain of business transaction, as it has been taxed earlier. However, court noted that due to fake invoices leading to fraudulent claims by persons, the facility is being misused, along with writ jurisdiction of the court.“This court... is exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution and when there is an allegation of such large-scale fraud, to the tune of more than Rs 56.2 crore, being committed with the involvement of a total of 527 firms including the petitioner firm, the court has to be circumspect in the exercise of its powers,” HC noted while imposing costs on the private entity after it emerged fake invoices were created to escape GST liability.","Delhi high court has fined a private firm for fraudulently claiming input tax credit (itc) to escape paying full gst.

NEW DELHI: The second day of CUET-UG, 2025 witnessed continued disruptions, as technical failures at exam centres affected more than 350 students across J&K and Delhi. The repeated setbacks have sparked serious concerns about the readiness of infrastructure supporting this critical national-level test. In J&K, the situation was further exacerbated by logistical failures. National Testing Agency (NTA), which conducts CUET-UG, confirmed cancellation of exam on May 14 at Kite Polytechnic centre in Srinagar, citing technical malfunctions. The test was also cancelled at the centre on May 13, the first day of the exam. While 76 students were unable to take the test on May 13, dozens more were affected on Wednesday. NTA said fresh dates will be announced and new admit cards will be issued to the affected candidates. However, the agency’s response has done little to address the growing frustration among students and their families in the region.Allocation of CUET-UG exam centres has also sparked widespread concern in Meghalaya, with the state govt accusing NTA of failing to communicate in advance about a shortage of centres within state. This oversight resulted in many students being assigned centres outside Meghalaya — some as far as Jorhat and Dibrugarh in Assam, Mizoram, and Bengal’s Kolkata — causing undue financial and logistical stress. Education minister Rakkam A Sangma urged NTA to defer the exams until additional centres, over 200 of which have already been identified and submitted to TCS for vetting, are made ready.J&K Students Association president Nasir Khuehami said he had received numerous distress calls from students unable to attend the exam. “Many had to flee homes due to the (India-Pakistan) conflict. Some are in different states and have no way to return. Their academic future is at risk,” he said. Several students assigned centres outside the UT described the situation as unmanageable. A resident of Jammu was allotted a centre in Himachal Pradesh. “Travelling during this period was not just unsafe—it was impossible. My whole year’s effort feels wasted,” he lamented.Delhi students faced a different set of obstacles. Candidates at centres such as the one in Rohini reported prolonged delays, power outages, and mismanagement. A students, who reached her centre at 6:30 am, said the gates remained closed well past reporting time, and the exam began nearly 90 minutes late. “There was no electricity, backup failed, and students were left waiting outside in the heat,” she said.Inside the examination centre, students experienced rushed verification, poor ventilation, and inadequate seating arrangements. “One AC for 40 students — barely working,” Panghal recalled.Similar reports came from centres in Ambala in Haryana, where candidates complained of extreme heat, lack of fans, and tight security that forced many to discard personal items due to the absence of lockers.","Cuet-ug, 2025 witnessed continued disruptions, as technical failures at exam centres affected more than 350 students across j&k and delhi.

ROHTAK: A routine attempt to unblock a domestic drain at Majra village in Haryana's Rohtak district turned tragic Wednesday when a retired Army man and two of his sons died inside a clogged sewer manhole. The deceased were Mahabir Singh and his sons Lakshman and Deepak.According to Mahabir's wife, Santosh Devi, a household drain had been backing up for days. Lakshman, who worked at a motorcycle-repair shop, lifted the manhole cover outside the house to investigate and slipped in. Mahabir immediately descended to rescue him but failed to re-emerge. Deepak, employed at a private firm in Rohtak, then entered the sewer in a final effort to save both, but all three succumbed, apparently to toxic gases.DSP Ravi Khundia called the accident ""deeply unfortunate"" & confirmed that postmortems were underway even as no formal complaint had been filed yet.","A routine attempt to unblock a domestic drain at majra village in haryana's rohtak district turned tragic wednesday.

21-day ‘biggest-ever op’ leaves 31 Maoists dead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/21-day-biggest-ever-op-leaves-31-maoists-dead/articleshow/121171477.cms,"Security forces concluded a 21-day anti-Maoist operation in Karreguttalu Hills. Thirty-one Maoist bodies were recovered. The operation scattered the Maoist command. Amit Shah called it the biggest assault on Maoists. Forces faced difficult terrain. They cleared caves housing arms manufacturing units. The operation busted a major Maoist stronghold. Disjointed Maoist formations are taking shelter in different places.

BIJAPUR: A 21-day anti-Maoist operation in Karreguttalu Hills (KGH) on the Chhattisgarh-Telangana border — headquarters of the most lethal of CPI(Maoist) wings, the PLGA Battalion No 1 , and housing its arms manufacturing units in the natural cave formations within — culminated on May 11, leaving scores of senior Maoists dead , with 31 bodies recovered, and segregated the Centrally-located Maoist command into 8-10 smaller, dislocated units with a massively depleted arsenal and armed capabilities.Hailing ‘ Operation Blackforest ’ — conducted from April 21 to May 11 by the Chhattisgarh Police’s special task force (STF) and district reserve guard (DRG) as well as CRPF — as “the biggest ever operation against Naxalism”, home minister Amit Shah in a post on X on Wednesday shared that the tricolour now flies proudly “on the hill where red terror once reigned”.“KGH was the unified headquarters of big Naxal organisations like PLGA Battalion 1, DKSZC, TSC & CRC, where along with Naxal training, strategies and weapons were also developed. Our security forces completed this biggest anti-Naxal operation in just 21 days and I am extremely happy that there was not a single casualty among the security forces,” Shah said as he congratulated CRPF, STF and DRG soldiers for facing the Naxalites “with exemplary courage even in adverse weather and treacherous terrain”.Eighteen security personnel injured in the operation are out of danger and recovering. The 28 neutralised Naxalites identified so far include 2 divisional committee members and 11 PLGA battalion fighters; they together carried a reward of Rs 1.72 crore.“Under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji, we are determined to root out Naxalism. I once again assure the countrymen that India is sure to be Naxal-free by 31 March 2026,” said Shah.Addressing a joint press conference here Wednesday, Chhattisgarh DGP Arun Dev Gautam said the forces defied challenging terrain, extreme temperatures and rainstorms, threats from wild animals and a web of landmines laid by the nearly 350 Maoists operating in the area, to reclaim KGH after killing at least 31 Maoists, including 16 women cadres. Around 250 caves running through the hills — which housed 4 arms manufacturing units with leth machines and weapon dumps holding 818 barrel grenade launchers; 35 automatic and semi-automatic weapons, 303 and INSAS rifles; 450 IEDs; cordex wires; besides 216 hideouts and bunkers; and 12,000 kg of food supplies and medicines — were cleared.DG CRPF G P Singh said the operation has busted yet another major Maoist stronghold after Chakrabanda in Bihar and Burapahar in Jharkhand. “The Maoist leadership and senior cadres who were congregated in the KGH hideout have been dislocated and segregated into smaller groups. The disjointed military formations have been forced to take shelter in different places,” he said. A source said this affects the CPI (Maoist) command structure and operational capabilities as the scattered groups cannot congregate for a big operation at short notice; also, it would be easier for the forces to go after them.Though the main objective of the operation was to neutralise top Maoist leaders like Hidma, the difficult topography of the hills made it difficult for the forces to assess the fatalities inflicted. But senior police and paramilitary official agreed that “the Maoists’ weaponry, arms and explosives emptied during the operation will significantly reduce their armed capabilities”.“Their technical units were busted and any attempt now by the scattered groups of Maoists, to reestablish contact will be detected through technical surveillance. Maoists are now possibly taking shelter in disjointed groups across national park area, West Bastar, south Bastar and parts of Telangana. Also, there seems to be some mistrust between the CPI Maoist leadership in Telangana and Chattisgarh. All this has put the Maoists on the backfoot,” said a senior officer.The CRPF DG said the once heavily-mined KGH hills have undergone several rounds of sanitisation, and the residual IEDs will also be de-mined soon. “Once this is done, the hills will be opened up for access by the locals,” he said adding that CRPF will be holding the area by setting up forward operating bases there.Gautam said Operation Blackforest — which displayed excellent coordination between the intelligence agencies, CRPF, Chhattisgarh Police, with Indian Air Force and BSF providing their choppers for airdropping rations and supplies and airlifting personnel and Telangana assisting CRPF on its side of KGH — has busted the Maoists’ belief that the area is their “impregnable” fortress.",Security forces concluded a 21-day anti-maoist operation in karreguttalu hills. Thirty-one maoist bodies were recovered. The operation scattered the maoist command. Forces faced difficult terrain. They cleared caves housing arms manufacturing units.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121171477,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-85910,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

File FIR on min for using ‘

gutter language

’ against Qureshi: HC

BHOPAL/JABALPUR: Madhya Pradesh high court took suo motu cognisance on Wednesday of state minister Vijay Shah’s remarks on Colonel Sofiya Qureshi , one of the two officers who were the face of the Indian armed forces during Operation Sindoor , and ordered the state DGP to register an FIR against him for using “gutter language” against a woman Army officer.HC ordered that the case be listed on top of the cause list Thursday and warned that if the FIR isn’t filed by then, the DGP will face contempt proceedings. Late Wednesday, CM Mohan Yadav said the order would be followed and an FIR was subsequently filed.The FIR was registered at Manpur police station in Ambedkar Nagar (Mhow) under the BNS sections specified by the court: 152, 196 (1) (b) and 197 (a) (c).A division bench of justices Atul Shreedharan and Anuradha Shukla said: “This court has been compelled to take up this matter suo motu on account of an incident published in various newspapers and digital media networks that has taken place at a public function at village Raikunda in Ambedkar Nagar, at Mhow, on Monday. A sitting minister of MP govt, whose name is Vijay Shah, has used scurrilous language against a senior official of the Indian Army.”The judges said the armed forces are perhaps the “last institution existing in this country”, reflecting integrity, industry, discipline, sacrifice, selflessness, character, honour and indomitable courage, with which any citizen of this country who values the same can identify themselves with. India’s armed forces have been “targeted by Vijay Shah who has used the language of the gutters”, the court said.“…the minister made a nauseating remark against Col Qureshi by way of an innuendo which can refer to none other than her alone, as there is no one else who would fit the description of the comment made by the minister,” HC said. “There are newspaper reports and a plethora of digital material on the internet in which the minister’s speech is clear and unequivocal… His comments are disparaging and dangerous, not just to the officer in question but to the armed forces itself.”Shah’s comment “encourages feelings of separatist activities by imputing separatist feelings to anyone who is Muslim, which thereby endangers the sovereignty or unity and integrity of India. Thus this court is prima facie satisfied that the first offence made out... is under BNS Sec 152”, the court said.",Madhya pradesh high court took suo motu cognisance of state minister vijay shah’s remarks on colonel sofiya qureshi.

Stricter security protocols Greater passenger awareness





KOLKATA: A 26-year-old air passenger from Imphal was arrested at Kolkata airport on Monday afternoon for allegedly uttering the word ""bomb"" while preparing to board a Mumbai-bound IndiGo flight. The incident triggered a full-scale security alert and delayed flight operations.The flyer, Regal Chongtham, reportedly told an IndiGo security officer at the step ladder point in Hindi, ""Mere paas bomb hai?"" (Do I have a bomb?), moments before boarding IndiGo flight 6E 5227, scheduled to depart for Mumbai at 1.30 pm from Bay 57L.According to officials, Chongtham grew frustrated while interacting with airline staff during the secondary ladder point checking and multiple checks of passengers' baggage as part of enhanced security measures because of the current tension between India and Pakistan.In an apparent act of sarcasm, he remarked, ""Mere paas bomb hai"" to an airline employee. Security personnel, adhering to strict airport safety protocols, immediately apprehended him and initiated emergency procedures.Upon receiving the alert, the Bomb Threat Assessment Committee (BTAC) was activated and classified the situation as ""specific"", leading to the aircraft being moved to an isolation bay in accordance with standard operating procedures (SOP).The airport's Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad (BDDS) and a sniffer dog unit promptly arrived at the scene to inspect Chongtham's belongings.Security protocols were quickly enforced, and all boarding operations were suspended. At the time of the incident, 179 of 186 passengers had already boarded. The remaining passengers and crew were de-boarded, and the aircraft underwent a thorough inspection.Following a thorough examination using explosive vapour detectors (EVDs), authorities declared his luggage safe, and no threats were found. Despite this, security measures were intensified, and relevant agencies were informed.Chongtham, who earlier arrived in Kolkata from Imphal on flight 6E 6716, was taken into custody for questioning. He is a resident of Sega Road Jonjeng Hajailukai in Imphal and was staying at a hostel in Mumbai.Cops said they were probing the motive behind the statement. Preliminary reports suggest the possibility of a prank or poor judgment on the part of the flyer, though officials have not ruled out other possibilities.Flight operations resumed after security agencies cleared the aircraft. No explosive materials were found.Authorities have reiterated the importance of adhering to strict security protocols at airports . They emphasised that making bomb-related remarks, even in jest, can lead to serious legal consequences, including detention or arrest.""We always urge passengers to remain cautious and cooperative during security checks to ensure the safety and smooth functioning of airport operations,"" said a senior airport official.","A 26-year-old air passenger from imphal was arrested at kolkata airport for allegedly uttering the word ""bomb"" the incident triggered a full-scale security alert and delayed flight operations.
