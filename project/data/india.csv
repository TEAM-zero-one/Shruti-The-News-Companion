NEP push ignites DMK-BJP row as Congress watches from sidelines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nep-push-ignites-dmk-bjp-row-as-congress-watches-from-sidelines/articleshow/118657136.cms,"DMK workers protest last week against Hindi ‘imposition’ (PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu’s protest over the withholding of central funds for schemes under Right to Education and Modi govt’s linking of these funds to implementation of the NEP by states, has reignited the “language war”. It’s a full-blown showdown between BJP and DMK for now, but there’s growing anxiety about whether it could force other players to take sides, adding to the already volatile political mix.When CM M K Stalin wrote to PM Modi, demanding release of Rs 2,512 crore for RTE schemes, Centre pointed to TN’s non-implementation of NEP. Stalin shot back, declaring he would not agree to the “imposition of Hindi” even for many more crores. Education minister Dharmendra Pradhan reacted, telling Stalin: “NEP 2020 upholds the principle of linguistic freedom and ensures students continue to learn in the language of their choice.”The north-south dimension of the issue is pronounced. Southern states like Karnataka and Kerala, and even others, take pride in their local languages and are receptive to suggestions that the north is imposing itself further — this, after having cornered political power post-Independence. Stalin’s remarks reflect DMK’s long-standing commitment to a two-language policy — Tamil and English — rooted in the state’s Dravidian ethos and its historical resistance to Hindi dating back to the anti-Hindi agitations of the 1930s and 1960s.The lure of language as a political weapon is evident. Since TN upped the ante, Punjab in the north and Telangana in the south have announced that Punjabi and Telugu, respectively, would be compulsory main languages in schools.The political edge to this spat has left the protagonists wary. While BJP is enthusiastic about Hindi, it also realises it cannot endear itself to the local population in the south by reinforcing its image as the party of north India. It is a key player in the bipolar politics of Karnataka, increasingly strong in Telangana, and is making an eager push in TN, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh by hoping to win over allies.The tightrope walk for BJP was evident when its TN chief K Annamalai alleged DMK was “deliberately misconstruing the NEP for political gains”. It has stressed in the southern states that the DMK’s allegation of Hindi imposition is without a basis as the three-language, which was first rolled out under Congress govts, focuses on the promotion of all Indian languages, rather than a specific one.Congress, meanwhile, has chosen to watch the battle from the sidelines. Party functionaries privately argue there is merit in DMK’s allegations, pointing to how acronyms of central schemes — and even the three new IPC-CrPC laws (Bharatiya Nyaya Samhita) — are chaste Hindi, without English equivalents. They call this new trend insensitive to southern sentiments, warning that it risks rekindling fears of “cultural imperialism”. They believe the row, if protracted, could also touch a raw nerve in the north-eastern states.However, the principal opposition party is mindful that it is a north Indian party and cannot take a position where it is perceived as “anti-Hindi”. This is why AICC has adopted anuanced stance on the language issue. Many point to the historical handicap that national parties like Congress, which must cater to all regions, are saddled with — unlike regional parties, which can pander to very local sentiments.This paradox was m ost evident in the 1990s when Samajwadi Party mascot Mulayam Singh Yadav crossed swords with late DMK neta M K Karunanidhi over the language issue, despite being allies at the Centre. The alliance along “secular vs communal” lines persists even today, though SP has since moderated its Hindi impulses by not joining the issue in recent years.Despite lingering concerns, Congress sources claimed the risk of a blowback is minimal, as language has not been a significant issue in the north for many years. They believe political planks in upcoming elections — like Bihar and Kerala — will revolve around caste census, social justice and anti-incumbency, rather than language.BJP will not make Congress’s tactical silence a big issue because it does not want its southern push to be hurt. But at the grassroots level, it will highlight Congress’s refusal to distance itself from Stalin in the same way it talked up DMK’s anti-Sanatan stand and Congress’s disinclination to disengage itself from it.","Tamil nadu’s protest over the withholding of central funds for schemes under right to education has reignited the ‘language war’ the north-south dimension of the issue is pronounced.

Pune: Police nabbed Swargate rape suspect Dattatray Gade (37) from the sugar cane fields at his native village Gunat, 70km from the city in Shirur taluka off the highway to Ahmednagar, around 1.30am on Friday and said he made three attempts in vain to end life by hanging himself while in hiding. The rope he used for hanging himself broke each time, police said.""We found ligature marks on Gade's neck at the time when our team detained him,"" Pune police commissioner Amitesh Kumar said on Friday. ""When asked about the marks, Gade told our investigators that he tried to hang himself late on Thursday night from a tree near the sugar cane field where he was hiding,"" the police chief said.Later in the day, a Swargate police team produced Gade before the court of judicial magistrate first class T S Gaigole, and sought his custodial remand for 14 days on the grounds of investigating the rape case. Gade's lawyers, Wajid Khan Bidkar and Ajinkya Mahadik, opposed the remand by submitting that there was no rape and that it was a case of consensual relationship after their client and the survivor had a chat at the bus terminus.

From two moms to none: Why 4-month-old HIV+ Mumbai baby is nobody's child,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-two-moms-to-none-why-4-month-old-hiv-mumbai-baby-is-nobodys-child/articleshow/118654518.cms,"Representative image

NAVI MUMBAI: A four-month-old baby girl has become nobody's child after a Hindu woman delivered her at KEM Hospital by fraudulently using the Aadhaar card of a Muslim woman who wanted to adopt the baby without going through the long, legal adoption procedure.The Muslim woman wanted to have another child for herself following a miscarriage during her second pregnancy, and the Hindu woman, who was pregnant, did not want the child as she said her husband was a drug addict. So they struck a deal.On getting a firm assurance from the Muslim woman that she would adopt the child, the Hindu woman delivered the baby using the Muslim woman's Aadhaar card. However, the baby is now ill and was in January detected as HIV positive at Wadia Hospital, so the Muslim woman doesn't want her anymore.While the baby has currently been admitted to a hospital in Kalwa, the state's women and child welfare department has lodged a zero FIR against both women for giving up or accepting and selling or buying a child illegally under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, and for cheating with common intention under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.Police said the mother of the baby girl and the Muslim woman live in the same neighbourhood in Kalyan. It was six months into her pregnancy that the woman told the Muslim woman that she did not want to have the child, which was when the Muslim woman offered to adopt the child. Using the Muslim woman's identity card, the Hindu woman delivered the baby in October 2024 at KEM Hospital. A birth certificate was issued bearing the name of a Muslim girl and mentioning the Muslim woman as her mother.Five days after discharge from hospital, the Muslim woman took the child home. The baby underwent an appendicitis surgery at Wadia Hospital in Jan this year, where she was detected as being HIV positive. Following this, the Muslim woman was taken for HIV tests. Having learnt of the baby's HIV infection, though, the Muslim woman disowned the baby and revealed the details of how she had got her to the hospital staffers, who alerted the local Sakhi centre of the women and child welfare department in Mumbai.Thereafter, on February 21, an email was sent by the local Sakhi centre giving details about the case to the Thane district child protection helpline.The child protection committee staffers could not trace the Muslim woman but succeeded in obtaining the cell number of the woman who gave birth to her. Accordingly, a zero FIR was filed with Manpada police station in Thane on Feb 28. The case has been transferred to Bhoiwada PS in Mumbai for further investigation.An officer of Thane district child protection committee said, ""People should follow adoption rules, and adoption complexities also need to be relaxed through the intervention of the women and child welfare department. This case raises questions about the identity checks of pregnant women who get admitted to govt-run premier hospitals for delivery.""Activists have long been demanding inquiries into such illegal adoptions which may be happening in hospitals, maternity homes, and clinics.","Muslim woman wanted to have another child for herself following a miscarriage.

Four workers were killed, and four remain missing after an avalanche hit a temporary workers’ camp at a Border Roads Organisation (BRO) highway construction site 500m beyond Mana near the India-China border, officials said on Saturday evening.The bodies were retrieved in an overnight operation led by the Army and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), but deep snow and harsh weather conditions have made rescue efforts difficult. Of the 55 workers present at the site, 47 were rescued by Saturday afternoon, around 36 hours after the avalanche struck around 5am on Friday.Mohindra Pal and Jitendra Singh from Himachal Pradesh, Manjeet Yadav from Uttar Pradesh, and Alok Yadav from Uttarakhand died in the avalanche, officials said.Of the 55 workers, 14 are from Bihar, 11 each from Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, seven from Himachal Pradesh, one each from J&K and Punjab, and 10 from Nepal.The four workers still missing are Harmesh Chand from Himachal, Ashok from UP, and Anil Kumar and Arvind Kumar Singh from Uttarakhand.Of these, 29 were airlifted from Mana and Badrinath to Jyotirmath, where they are receiving treatment at an Army hospital, the State Emergency Operation Centre said. One man escaped on his own and reached is home in Himachal on Saturday evening, sources said.CM Pushkar Singh Dhami said, “Rescue teams have brought out workers from five containers, but three containers remain untraceable due to heavy snow. The Army and ITBP are making intensive efforts to locate the containers where the missing workers are believed to be trapped.”A dog squad from NDRF was airlifted to assist in the search, and a ground penetration radar is being transported from Delhi to help detect buried containers. Nearly 200 personnel from multiple agencies — including the Army, ITBP, BRO, NDRF, SDRF, district administration, police, health department, and fire services — are involved in the operation.Vinod Kumar Suman, secretary of the disaster management department, said an Army helipad near the Mana base camp has been made operational, while efforts are underway to remove “6-7 feet of snow from the Badrinath helipad”. The IAF’s Mi-17 helicopter, three Cheetah choppers, two state govt helicopters, and an ambulance helicopter from AIIMS Rishikesh were deployed on Saturday morning, but “helicopter operations were halted at 3pm due to snowfall in Mana”, a senior official said. With the risk of further avalanches increasing due to continuous snowfall, Dhami directed officials to relocate workers from highrisk areas to safer locations.","Officials said 29 survivors have been airlifted from mana and badrinath to jyotirmath, where they are receiving treatment at an army hospital.

AI Express starts flights from Hindon Airport,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ai-express-starts-flights-from-hindon-airport/articleshow/118650224.cms,"NEW DELHI: Residents of Ghaziabad and nearby places now have the option of flying direct to many parts of India from Hindon Airport . Air India Express on Saturday operated it first Kolkata-Hindon-Goa flight, making its 180-seater Boeing 737 MAX the biggest passenger aircraft to operate from this defence enclave. While inaugurating the service, Union aviation minister K Rammohan Naidu said, “One day, I hope to see Hindon to London flights .” The direct connectivity from western UP’s Hindon comes months before the upcoming Noida International Airport at Greater Noida’s Jewar becomes operational later this summer.AI Express , which became the first big airline to operate from both the IGI Airport and Hindon, will start operating 40 weekly direct flights from Hindon to Bengaluru, Chennai, Goa, Jammu and Kolkata by March 22, 2025. For a few days this month starting March 10, the airline will also operate a thrice weekly Hindon-Mumbai flight. The airline sees the entire north/east Delhi NCR, western UP’s Ghaziabad, Meerut and Noida as key catchment areas.Minister Naidu said: “With the addition of Hindon to its growing network, Air India Express is not only strengthening connectivity but also offering greater flexibility across the NCR. The launch of services from Hindon will complement existing operations at IGI Airport, reflecting Govt’s vision of expanding aviation infrastructure to meet the growing demand for air travel.”Commercial operations from Hindon Bega just before Covid in October 2019 when a now defunct airline connected the airport to Pithoragarh. While smaller regional airlines have not been very successful so far in India, Hindon got stable operations when Star Air, the aviation arm of Sanjay Ghodawat group, started operating here. Star Air currently connects Hindon to Adampur, Nanded, Kishangarh, Pune and Bengaluru with its 76-seater Embraer E175 aircraft. AI Express’ 180-seater B737 is the biggest commercial airliner to operate so far from this defence enclave.“Commercial operations to and from Hindon as of now happen from sunrise to sunset. The airport can handle one flight in an hour so the six flights AI Express will have from later this month have been staggered,” said sources.Aloke Singh, AI Express MD, said, “The launch of our operations from Hindon marks another milestone in our network expansion journey. Hindon serves a vast catchment area covering Eastern and Northern geography of the Delhi NCR, besides Ghaziabad and western parts of UP. As the Indian air market grows and matures, metropolitan regions can be served by multiple airports as we see in cities like London, New York and Tokyo. The services from Hindon will complement our extensive operations from Indira Gandhi International Airport, from where we serve 18 domestic and four international destinations. As our fleet crosses the 100 aircraft mark, we continue our journey of expansion and remain dedicated to offering a seamless and affordable flying experience across India, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.""","Air india express on saturday operated it first kolkata-hindon-goa flight.

Uttarakhand avalanche: Mana villagers saved by ancient wisdom & annual migration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uttarakhand-avalanche-mana-villagers-saved-by-ancient-wisdom-annual-migration/articleshow/118637614.cms,"Each Nov, as doors of Badrinath temple close, residents of Mana move to Gopeshwar, Jyotirmath, and Jhinkwan in Chamoli district, leaving behind their homes and livelihoods to escape harsh winter

DEHRADUN: Mana, a 2,000-strong village in the upper reaches of Garhwal Himalayas , had already emptied out when disaster struck. By the time an avalanche crashed down the Mana-Ghastoli route on Friday morning, smothering everything in its path, the roads were deserted, the homes abandoned. As a result, not many heard the sound of ice fracturing, snow cascading, and the earth shuddering under its weight. They are now counting their blessings.The villagers' migration, a ritual dictated by centuries of wisdom, is more than tradition - it is survival. The Himalayas demand deference, and the people of Mana have long known when to step aside. ""We are fortunate we had shifted to lower locations; otherwise, many people could have been trapped,"" said Pitambhar Molpha , the village headman.Each Nov, as the doors of the Badrinath temple close, the residents of Mana undertake their annual migration, leaving behind their homes and livelihoods to escape the harsh winter. They move to Gopeshwar, Jyotirmath, and Jhinkwan in Chamoli district. They return only when the Badrinath yatra is about to begin.The avalanche - just 500 metres from the village - was neither the first nor the last. ""Avalanches have been reported here in Feb and March before,"" Molpha said. ""At this time of year, workers are engaged in removing snow from the main routes. There is also an army camp near our village.""For those who leave, there is always the lingering question of what remains. Sandeep Aswal, who runs a tea stall - once known as the 'last tea stall of the country' and now rebranded as the 'first tea stall' - has watched tourists come and go, drawn by Mana's mystique. ""It is an unfortunate incident. Since the village is empty, we don't have any updates on whether the avalanche impacted the area. But we feel blessed that all 400 families had already moved,"" he said.","Each nov, as doors of badrinath temple close, residents of mana move to gopeshwar, jyotirmath, and jhinkwan.

A division bench comprising Justice MM Sundresh and Justice Rajesh Bindal said the prosecution failed to present conclusive evidence linking Bhanmati to the crime.SC found flaws in the lower courts’ reasoning, particularly their reliance on the recovery of a “gandasi” (axe) as evidence. It said the axe was found much later than the victim’s body and that there were no fingerprints of the accused on it.“Suffice it is to state that the materials presented by the prosecution are not sufficient enough to unerringly point out the guilt on the part of the appellant alone,” SC ruled.The case dates back to December 11, 2002, when the body of a four-and-a-half-year-old boy was discovered in a village well in Kila-Jaffargarh of Jind.The boy’s father lodged an FIR next day and during the probe , Bhanmati was accused of the crime. She was convicted by the trial court, a decision later upheld by a division bench of HC comprising Justice Mahesh Grover and Justice Shekhar Dhawan.Advocate Ram Naresh Yadav, who represented Bhanmati in SC, argued the evidence was inadequate. “Even assuming the recovery to be true, it alone would not be sufficient, as there is no evidence to show that it was used for committing the offence,” he contended. The prosecution had claimed Bhanmati committed the crime due to a family dispute, alleging the mother of the deceased had been beating her children.However, SC found this motive unconvincing. Even at that point of time, the appellant was a middle-aged woman and her children were major while the deceased was only 4.5 years old, the bench said.","The case dates back to december 11, 2002, when the body of a four-and-a-half-year-old boy was discovered in a village well in kila-jaffargarh of jind.
