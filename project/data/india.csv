PUNE: Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar acknowledged Tuesday that bitterness between the two factions of NCP has eased after they came together for Pune Municipal Corporation and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation elections, holding out hope for a possible patch-up with his uncle and party founder Sharad Pawar He denied holding talks with Sharad Pawar, 85, on a merger or continued alliance but left the door open. ""There has been no discussion with Pawar Saheb at all. However, I want to make it clear that there are no permanent enemies in politics,"" Ajit Pawar said in an interview to TOI.""People can make whatever inferences they want from my statement,"" he said. ""All I want to say is that I am a follower of Yashwantrao Chavan and I believe in the politics of addition, not subtraction.""Ajit Pawar, 66, and Sharad Pawar formally split in July 2023 when the nephew broke away with several MLAs and joined BJP -led state govt as deputy CM. The rupture followed an earlier, short-lived alignment with BJP in Nov 2019. Now, after months of acrimony that spilled into Lok Sabha and assembly campaigns last year, the two NCP groups have allied for key civic polls in Pune and neighbouring Pimpri-Chinchwad.Asked whether the alliance would extend beyond the municipal elections, Ajit Pawar said no decision had been taken but acknowledged its immediate impact.""When such an alliance happens, it automatically helps reduce the bitterness on both sides,"" he said, adding that neither group has traded barbs since the pact was sealed.Party workers were instrumental in bridging the divide. ""My section convinced me to ally with them. Similarly, workers from other group conveyed the same message to their seniors,"" he said. Ajit Pawar said he met the netas from Sharad Pawar camp, including Supriya Sule and Rohit Pawar, after which city units negotiated seat-sharing.The deputy CM said the contest in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, initially seen as tilted towards BJP, has tightened. ""Residents are not only listening to us but also responding positively,"" he said, contrasting it with the response he saw while campaigning for his wife Sunetra Pawar during the Lok Sabha elections.He credited the improved mood to the reunion of NCP base. ""NCP supporters have always given their first preference to Pawar Saheb. A section of them also likes my style of working,"" he said. ""When we split, our supporters were divided. Now... both sections have reunited.""Reflecting on his work ethic, Ajit Pawar traced it to his uncle's influence. ""I was in Class III when Pawar Saheb became an MLA,"" he said, recalling serving tea to visitors. ""I've been following the same principle in my political career for over three decades.""Responding to opposition allegations that NCP and BJP had made tacit adjustments by not forming alliances in PMC and PCMC, Ajit Pawar pushed back. ""There is no match-fixing between us,"" he said. ""They are trying to strengthen their party and I am trying the same for mine.""He said the decision for Mahayuti partners to contest separately in the two civic bodies was taken by CM Devendra Fadnavis, citing BJP's numerical strength in both corporations. ""Had talks of an alliance between BJP and Sena failed early, we would have probably got Eknath Shinde's party on our side in both civic bodies,"" he added.","Ajit pawar and sharad pawar formally split in july 2023 when the nephew broke away with several mlas and joined bjp -led state govt as deputy cm.

Infirmities in anti-graft law clause that shields babus: SC; but bench split on nixing it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/infirmities-in-anti-graft-law-clause-that-shields-babus-sc-but-bench-split-on-nixing-it/articleshow/126515844.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday held that Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act, which bars police and agencies from probing corruption complaints against public servants without prior govt approval, suffered from infirmities. But an SC division bench differed on its implication - while one judge declared it outrightly illegal, saying the provision will protect corrupt officials, the other judge said striking it down would amount to ""throwing the baby out with the bathwater"" and the defect could be cured by roping in Lokpal/Lokayukta to take a decision on sanction.The split verdict was pronounced by a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan on a PIL challenging the validity of Section 17A.The split verdict by the Supreme Court bench came on a PIL challenging the validity of Section 17A that was introduced in 2018 in the PC Act after a similar provision of Section 6A of the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act was struck down by SC in 2014.Terming Section 17A a ""resurrection"" of the quashed Section 6A of the DSPE Act and saying that ""it is old wine in a new bottle"", Justice B V Nagarathna held that Section 17A has to be struck down for being contrary to the judgments of the larger bench and constitution bench of this court.Justice K V Viswanathan, however, was of the view that there is deficiency in the provision as it does not provide an independent mechanism to impartial examination of corruption complaints against public servants and the task cannot be entrusted to the govt department of the official concerned. He said Section 17A is constitutionally valid, subject to the condition that grant or refusal or the approval by the competent authority mentioned therein will depend on the recommendation of Lokpal or Lokayukta in case of states. In view of divergent opinion, the bench directed the registry to place the case before the CJI for constituting of an appropriate bench to consider afresh the issues which arise in this matter.Emphasising that ""throwing the baby out with the bathwater"" is not an option, Justice Viswanathan said, ""The panacea of striking down will turn out to be worse than the disease.""He said there was a need to protect honest officers in discharging their duties without fear of frivolous complaint against them and that object is sub-served by Section 17A, but the only aspect missing expressly from the statute is the provision for an independent screening mechanism.""Civil servants should have the necessary freedom to take administrative decisions and express their views fearlessly without any threat of frivolous or vexatious complaints, for if they were to be exposed to such complaints in the future, there will be a chilling effect on them and their hands will be shackled. The net result will be a policy paralysis. It will be the tendency of every civil servant then to play it safe by taking no decision at all,"" Justice Viswanathan said. The judge agreed with the Law Commission's 254th report, which also suggested involving Lokpal/Lokayukta in the process under Section 17A.Emphasising that there should be zero tolerance towards corruption, Justice Nagarathna said the provision would protect a corrupt official as mandatory prior sanction would embolden officials to toe the line of their superior to make themselves safe. ""In all the above circumstances, prior approval under Section 17A of the Act may not be granted by the department even when public servants have to ideally be inquired/enquired/investigated within the meaning of Section 17A of the PC Act. This means the mechanism of a prior approval would be used to protect public servants who would align and against those who do not fall in line by a threat of commencing an inquiry/investigation against them,"" she said.She said there is need for an independent and autonomous person or body, who or which has nothing to do with the formulation and implementation of departmental policies or in the making of a recommendation or taking of a decision, to consider a request under Section 17A of the PC Act. ""Such a body within the govt as per the said provision is conspicuous by its absence inasmuch as the same is not spelt out in the provision,"" Justice Nagarathna said, adding there is ""lack of objectivity, neutrality and fairness"" in the provision.""In my view, there ought to have been an independent body which is not controlled by the govt to consider a case for grant of prior approval to conduct an inquiry/enquiry/investigation by a police officer. In the absence of such an independent and autonomous body which can make an impartial consideration with objectivity, Section 17A of the PC Act would be effectively frustrated for being vague and lacking in any guidance,"" Justice Nagarathna said.Justice Viswanathan said if Section 17A is invalidated on the ground that prior approval should not exist at all, the immediate consequence would be that any complaint alleging corruption in official decision-making could straightaway result in a police inquiry or investigation.""This would permit immediate registration of FIRs, commencement of investigation and resort to coercive steps in cases involving recommendations and decisions in discharge of duty, regardless of whether the complaint is frivolous, motivated or based on hindsight. Such a result would be regressive,"" he said.",Section 17a of the prevention of corruption (pc) act bars police and agencies from probing corruption complaints against public servants without prior govt approval.

J&K LG sacks 5 govt staff over links with terror outfits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-lg-sacks-5-govt-staff-over-links-with-terror-outfits/articleshow/126515411.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Jammu & Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha on Tuesday ordered the termination of five J&K govt staffers over alleged links with terror outfits and their Pakistan-based commanders working with ISI to plot and execute terror attacks in India.Among the employees dismissed under Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution are laboratory technician Tariq Ahmad Rah and forest field worker Farooq Ahmad Bhat, both from Anantnag. The two, along with ex-MLA Gul Mohammad Akhoon, are accused in a case taken over by the J&K state investigation agency (SIA) in Sept 2023, facing charges of a criminal conspiracy to extend logistical support to Hizbul Mujahideen (Hizb) divisional commander Mohammad Amin Baba alias Aabid and facilitate his escape to Pakistan in 2005 via the Attari-Wagah border. Amin Baba was Tariq’s uncle and divisional commander of Hizb from 1998 to 2005. Farooq, who was then informally working as a personal assistant to Akhoon, helped Tariq plan Amin Baba’s escape. Farooq used his government identity card to avoid security checks at nakas and dropped Amin Baba at the international border. Ex-MLA Akhoon provided a government Gypsy vehicle, with his personal security officers and driver, to transport Amin Baba to the international border.“Amin Baba is currently operating from Islamabad and attends regular meetings with ISI, LeT and Jaish operatives, to plot terrorist activities in India. He trains HM cadres in PoJK terror camps and recruits Kashmiri youths for terror,” sources shared.Both Tariq and Farooq were arrested in 2024 but later got bail. Inputs suggest they have since resumed their terror activities.Others sacked on Monday include school teacher Mohd Ishfaq who was arrested in 2022 before he could execute a Lashker e Taiba plot to kill a police officer in Doda; and driver Mohd Yousf who, on the direction of Pakistan-based HM terrorist Bashir Ahmad Bhat, was procuring arms and transporting terror funds in Ganderbal area. Also fired was assistant lineman Bashir Ahmad Mir for having provided shelter to two LeT terrorists before they were neutralised by the security forces in his house in September 2021.With the latest set of dismissals, the total number of J&K govt employees terminated by the Manoj Sinha administration so far has risen to 85. ""Since 2021, the LG has decisively removed terrorists and their enablers from government service, while simultaneously extending opportunities and dignity to the genuine victims of terror by providing them employment,"" a J&K govt official told TOI.As per the dossiers on the five sacked J&K govt staffers accessed by TOI, Mohd Ishfaq was working for LeT and was in regular contact with Pakistan-based LeT commander Mohd Amin alias Abu Khubaib, designated by India as an individual terrorist. Ishfaq was put under surveillance and arrested in April 2022 before he could execute an LeT plan to kill a police officer in Doda. Investigators found he was misusing his position as a teacher to influence youth to join terror groups.Bashir Ahmed Mir was found to be operating as an overground worker of LeT in Gurez area of Bandipora. “He was guiding the movement of terrorists, providing them logistical support and sharing information on movement of security forces. His role came to light in Sept 2021 when anti-terror operations were launched at his house and two terrorists hiding there were neutralised,” an officer told TOI.Two AK-47 weapons and ammunition were recovered from Bashir’s house. He was arrested but later got bail on medical grounds.Mohd Yousf, a govt hospital driver posted at Bemina, Srinagar, was in regular contact with Pakistan-based Hizb operative Bashir Ahmad Bhat. On July 20, 2024, the police intercepted a vehicle in which Yousf and his associate Eashan Hamid were travelling, and recovered one pistol, ammunition, grenade and Rs 5 lakh in cash. Yousf revealed he was delivering the consignment to a terrorist on the direction of his Pakistani handler. He also confessed to providing phones to jailed terrorists to establish communication with their Pakistan-based handlers.",Jammu & kashmir lg manoj sinha on tuesday ordered the termination of five j&k govt staffers over alleged links with terror outfits.

Vande Bharat Sleeper: Top Features

Vande Bharat sleeper launch soon! Indian Railways is all set to launch its first Vande Bharat sleeper this week, with PM Narendra Modi expected to flag off the new train on January 117 between Howrah and Kamakhya (Guwahati). Ahead of the launch, Indian Railways has announced the fare structure and ticket prices for the Vande Bharat sleeper train.Built specifically for overnight travel and long-distance routes, the Vande Bharat sleeper is a fully air-conditioned trainset developed in-house by Indian Railways. These trains are intended for routes spanning roughly 1,200 to 1,500 kilometres, catering to passengers travelling across states during night hours.For the Vande Bharat Sleeper service, Indian Railways has set a minimum chargeable distance of 400 km for fare calculation.During test runs on the Kota–Nagda section, the Vande Bharat sleeper achieved its designed top speed of 180 kmph. One of the highlights of the trial was a stability demonstration in which glasses filled with water remained steady without spilling, even at speeds exceeding 180 kmph.Although the train is designed for semi-high-speed operations of up to 160 kmph in regular service, trials have been conducted at 180 kmph.Actual operating speeds will depend on the condition and capability of tracks on different sections of the network.The sleeper version is designed as the long-haul, overnight counterpart to the Vande Bharat chair car services currently operating across India.Drawing inspiration from European rail design, the sleeper coaches feature cushioned berths for improved comfort and redesigned access to upper berths for easier movement.Passenger amenities include soft night lighting, integrated audio-visual passenger information systems, CCTV surveillance and modular pantry units.The trains will be equipped with aircraft-style bio-vacuum toilets, including facilities for persons with disabilities, baby care areas and shower units with hot water in the first-class coach.Safety systems include the indigenous KAVACH anti-collision technology, while regenerative braking will be used to enhance energy efficiency, similar to existing Vande Bharat chair car trains.Additional features include sealed gangways and automatic inter-coach doors to maintain air quality and cabin temperature, along with personal reading lights, charging points, foldable snack tables and interiors finished with GFRP panels.Train doors will open automatically at designated stations.

NEW DELHI: Holding that the constitutional goal of fraternity can be achieved only when a rickshaw puller's child studies in a school alongside the child of a multi-millionaire or a Supreme Court judge, the apex court Tuesday initiated the exercise to ensure that all schools make available 25% free seats for children from poor and disadvantaged sections, as mandated under Right to Education Act (RTE).A bench of Justices P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar said the RTE Act envisages elementary education for all children in a shared institutional space without differentiating them on the basis of caste, class, gender or economic status. Writing the judgment, Justice Narasimha said, ""It makes it possible, normatively and structurally, for the child of a multi-millionaire or even of a Judge of the Supreme Court of India to sit in the same classroom and at the same bench as the child of an autorickshaw driver or a street vendor. This is the way Section 12 seeks to concretise the constitutional principle of fraternity alongside equality and liberty.""Dispelling the skepticism of many holding the traditional but mistaken view that 'fraternity' is non-enforceable, SC said, ""Unlike equality and liberty, which are frequently framed as individual rights-claims, fraternity is relational; it operates through institutional arrangements that enable individuals to 'lose suspect identities' based on caste, class or other hierarchies and to form solidaristic bonds.""In this sense, the 25% inclusion under Section 12, in unaided neighbourhood schools, is not an isolated welfare measure but a vehicle through which the constitutional commitment to fraternity and the 'development of the child' as recognised in Article 21A and Article 39(f) is sought to be realised,"" it said. The court also cited the Kothari Commission report's emphasis on the Common School System wherein children from every section of society get equal education without discrimination.It quoted HRD ministry's statement: ""The often-voiced concern about how 25% children from disadvantaged groups and weaker sections can cope in an environment where rich children exist can be resolved when teaching-learning process and teachers use these children as sources of knowledge so that their esteem and recognition go up and they begin to be treated as equals."" The bench said it is necessary and compelling to formulate subordinate legislation by issuing necessary rules and regulations, prescribing the method and manner by which children of weaker and disadvantaged sections are to be admitted in neighbourhood schools.""We direct the appropriate authorities to prepare and issue, in consultation with the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and SCPCRs, as the case may be, as well as the National and State Advisory Councils, necessary rules and regulations under Section 38 of the Act for implementing the mandate of Section 12(1)(c) of the Act,"" it said.""We further direct NCPCR to collate information about the issuance of rules and regulations by the states and UTs and file an affidavit before this Court by March 31,"" the bench said, listing the matter for further hearing on April 6.",The apex court tuesday initiated the exercise to ensure that all schools make available 25% free seats for children from poor and disadvantaged sections.

Hinduism vs Hindutva: TMC MP Mahua Moitra’s 'Love Jihad' Remark Ignites Fierce Political Debate

RAIPUR: The headmistress of a govt school in Chhattisgarh has been suspended while a contractual assistant teacher faces dismissal after a Class 4 English exam paper listed 'Ram' as a possible answer to a multiple-choice question about the name of a protagonist's dog, reports Partha Behera. The paper-setter said the error occurred as a result of inadvertently dropping the last letter of 'Ramu'.The school education department announced the decision on Saturday, four days after the question paper sparked protests across state by VHP, Bajrang Dal and other organisations. Shikha Soni, headmistress of a govt primary school in Nakti village of Tilda block, had set the paper for half-yearly examinations across govt schools in Raipur division. Namrata Verma, an assistant teacher on contract, moderated it.To the question 'What is the name of Mona's dog?', students had four options to choose from: 'Bala', 'Sheru', 'Ram' and 'No one'. Soni said the 'typo' went unnoticed while Verma said she failed to spot the incorrect option.Both maintained they had no intention of hurting religious sentiments or any community.","Shikha soni, headmistress of a govt primary school in nakti village of tilda block, had set the paper for half-yearly examinations.

It said that the provision contemplates ""maintenance of dependants"", including ""widowed daughter in-law"" from the estate of her father-in-law.""A son or the legal heirs are bound to maintain all the dependent persons out of estate inherited i.e. all persons whom the deceased was legally and morally bound to maintain.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has shortlisted 11 medical institutions across the country for a study to define what is medically normal for Indian children and adolescents - a move expected to significantly improve diagnosis and treatment.At present, many of the ""normal ranges"" used to interpret children's blood tests and other investigations are based on data from western populations, which doctors say may not accurately reflect Indian children's health profiles. The new study aims to address the gap by generating India-specific reference values. ""These reference values are crucial in helping doctors decide whether a child's test result falls within a healthy range or requires medical attention,"" said Dr Tushar Sehgal, in charge or hematology section in department of laboratory medicine of AIIMS and one of the principal investigators.""Children are not small adults, and Indian children are influenced by distinct genetic, nutritional and environmental factors. Using reference values developed for other populations can lead to errors. Creating indigenous reference ranges will greatly improve diagnostic accuracy and help avoid both unnecessary treatment and missed diagnoses,"" Dr Sehgal said. He added so-called ""normal"" blood test values can vary depending on where people live and their nutritional background.People living at high altitudes, for instance, naturally have higher haemoglobin levels because their bodies adapt to lower oxygen levels.The shortlisted institutions include AIIMS Delhi, Jodhpur, Raipur, Bhopal, Kalyani and Gauhati along with NIMHANS and others medical institutes. Under the study, data will be collected from healthy children and adolescents to establish reliable baseline health values that clinicians can use across hospitals and diagnostic laboratories.",The indian council of medical research has shortlisted 11 medical institutions across the country for a study to define what is medically normal for indian children and adolescents.

SRINAGAR: Ladakh UT administration on Tuesday suspended the famous Chaddar trek over frozen Zanskar river after a committee comprising BRO and UT Disaster Response Force found the river had begun to unfreeze, making one of India’s most challenging winter treks hazardous.“No trekking or allied adventure activity will be permitted on the route during the suspension period... We will analyse the conditions after Jan 20 and take a further decision,” district disaster management authority CEO Ghulam Mohd told a press conference in Leh.The trek was scheduled to begin on January 10.The officials said Chaddar trek has significant potential for winter tourism in Ladakh. “We are sensitive to the importance of the trek because it brings a large number of tourists to the region,” he said.Over the past two years, the govt has deployed SDRF and NDRF teams and provided medical assistance to trekkers. “No tourist is permitted on the trek without medical clearance,” Mohd said.Over 500 tourists took part in the trek on the frozen river, where temperatures can drop to minus 25 degrees Celsius, last year, while over 300 had registered this season.This year over 300 tourists registered for the trek on the frozen river, where temperatures can drop to minus 25 degrees Celsius, as against 500 last year.","Ladakh ut administration on tuesday suspended the famous chaddar trek over frozen zanskar river.

The case so far



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday continued hearing the case on stray dogs, warning that states will likely pay a compensation for 'not doing anything' for every bite that leads to death or injury to either children or the elderly.The apex court also asked for accountability from those claiming to be dog feeders, telling them to continue their activity from their house. The hearing took place in front of three-judge special bench comprising Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N.V. AnjariaJustice Nath said, ""For every dog bite, death or injury caused to children or elderly, we are likely going to fix heavy compensation by state, for not doing anything. Also, liability and accountability on those who are saying we are feedings dogs. Do it, take them to your house. Why should dogs be littering around, biting, scaring people?""Justice Mehta concurred with his views and said, “Who should be held accountable when dogs attack a 9-year-old? The organisation that is feeding them? You want us to shut our eyes to the problem.""The SC had refused to examine allegations of harassment of women dog feeders and caregivers, reiterating that such complaints fall under law and order issues and that affected individuals can lodge FIRs. Hearing arguments in the stray dogs case, the apex court also declined to consider claims that derogatory remarks were being made against women in the course of the debate.The three-judge special bench observed that some of the submissions made before it were 'far from reality' and pointed to several videos showing stray dogs attacking children and elderly persons.The court was hearing a batch of pleas, including those filed by dog lovers, seeking modification of its earlier orders as well as petitions demanding strict enforcement of existing directions.The bench clarified that it had never ordered the removal of all stray dogs from the streets and that its directions were limited to the treatment of stray canines in accordance with the Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules.It also flagged widespread non-compliance by civic bodies, noting that people were dying not only due to dog bites but also because of road accidents caused by stray animals.Citing an “alarming rise” in dog bite incidents in institutional areas such as schools, hospitals and railway stations, the Supreme Court on November 7 directed that stray dogs be relocated to designated shelters after due sterilisation and vaccination. It also ordered that dogs picked up should not be released back at the places from where they were removed.The court further directed authorities to ensure the removal of cattle and other stray animals from state highways, national highways and expressways.The Supreme Court is hearing the matter as a suo motu case initiated on July 28 last year following media reports on stray dog attacks leading to rabies, particularly among children, in the national capital.","The supreme court is hearing the matter as a suo motu case initiated on july 28 last year following media reports on stray dog attacks leading to rabies, particularly among children.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka's opposition BJP on Tuesday launched a sharp attack on the Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah and deputy CM DK Shivakumar for allegedly prioritising Rahul Gandhi over German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who landed in Bengaluru for his visit to India.The allegations follow the Congress leaders' presence in Mysuru to receive senior party leader Rahul Gandhi, who was transiting to neighbouring Tamil Nadu.In a post on X, LoP in the state assembly R Ashoka accused the Congress government of ""misplaced priorities and missed opportunities"". He said that welcoming the head of government from one of the world’s strongest economies had been relegated to the back seat, while ""political loyalty and high command pleasing"" were given precedence over Karnataka’s global standing.The LoP wrote, ""Whose interests come first, Karnataka's or the High Command's? Today, the Chancellor of Germany—one of the world's most powerful economic forces—arrived in our Karnataka. Any responsible Chief Minister would welcome such a global leader and leverage this meeting for the state's progress. They would view this encounter with a global leader as a golden opportunity to boost investment, job creation, and industrial development in our state.He further went on to lay charges on the leaders to betray Karnataka. ""This isn't merely a lapse in protocol; it's a betrayal of Karnataka's interests,"" he wrote.Merz, on the second day of his two-day official visit to India, arrived in Bengaluru and visited the Bosch campus at Adugodi.He also visited the Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE) at the Indian Institute of Science before departing from the city, official sources said.Ashoka further went on to add that the German chancellor’s visit was of ""immense diplomatic, economic and strategic significance"" for Karnataka. ""But while the German chancellor landed in Bengaluru, Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar chose to be in Mysuru to receive Rahul Gandhi, who was merely transiting to Ooty (Gudalur in the Nilgiris district of Tamil Nadu).

Siddaramaiah, DK Shivakumar Project Unity After High-Stakes Karnataka Meet Amid Rumours Of Cong Rift

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi briefly met Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah and deputy CM DK Shivakumar at the Mysuru airport on Tuesday, fuelling speculation amid the ongoing power tussle between the two state Congress stalwarts.The interaction took place on the tarmac during Gandhi’s transit halt while returning to Delhi from Tamil Nadu. He spoke to both leaders, separately and together. Gandhi transited through Mysuru twice during the day—while travelling to Tamil Nadu and again on his return—with Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar present on both occasions.While the contents of the discussion are not known, party sources said it centred on the Congress’ “Save MGNREGA” campaign and the Karnataka government’s contribution to push for restoration of the 2006 legislation implemented by the erstwhile Congress-led Union government. The meeting came as both leaders were seeking an appointment with Gandhi.Siddaramaiah is reportedly pressing for a Cabinet reshuffle, while Shivakumar wants clarity on a leadership change. Party insiders believe approval for a reshuffle would indicate Siddaramaiah is set to complete his full term, weakening the prospects of Shivakumar, who also heads the party's state unit.Speculation over a potential leadership change has intensified since the Congress government crossed the halfway mark of its term in November last year, amid reports of an unconfirmed power-sharing arrangement at the time of government formation in May 2023.Siddaramaiah later told reporters there was “no confusion” within the party and said no political discussions took place during his meeting with Gandhi.","Rahul gandhi briefly met karnataka chief minister siddaramaiah and deputy cm dk shivakumar at the mysuru airport on tuesday.

Harsh orders needed to curb corruption in judiciary: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/harsh-orders-needed-to-curb-corruption-in-judiciary-sc/articleshow/126515247.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a classic case of fence eating the grass, a UP trial court was cast in an adverse light when one of its court clerks, taking advantage of a man's drinking habit, made him sign a sale deed for a portion of his ancestral property and a civil judge gave orders to police to enforce the sale.Allahabad HC found that using the judicial process, the court clerk threw out a woman and her three children from the house using the sale deed signed by her husband in a drunken stupor. HC ordered the court clerk to restore the property to the woman within 48 hours and pay her Rs 1 lakh, and recommended disciplinary proceedings against the clerk and civil judge.Senior advocate H S Phoolka tried his best to project the clerk as an innocent victim of conspiracy before Supreme Court and said the HC had been unusually harsh. However, he failed to evoke sympathy from a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi.The CJI said such an act by a court clerk should have been adequate reason for the district judiciary to send him packing. ""Sometimes, we need to pass such harsh orders when it is found that a conspiracy is hatched within the four walls of the court, where people come for justice,"" the bench said.""We must send the right message. If we do not pass harsh orders in such incidents, it will be difficult for people to repose faith and trust in the judiciary. We see no ground to change a single word in the HC judgment. HC is absolutely right in passing the order,"" it added.Dismissing the court clerk's appeal, SC said, ""In the peculiar circumstances of the case, HC has issued these unusual directions to ensure public faith and trust in the judicial system is maintained. HC directions are befitting the facts of the case. None of the observations and consequential directions require our interference.""The court clerk, a peshkar in the court of the chief judicial magistrate, obtained a sale deed in his favour from the woman's husband dated Feb 14, 2024 for a portion of the undivided residential house, despite knowing full well that the property had not been divided between the brothers and co-sharers of the property. On Jan 13 last year, the woman resisted eviction action initiated through an interim order passed by the trial court. Following this, the court clerk obtained another decree and, with the help of police, evicted her.SC said it was unprecedented for a civil court to pass a decree on the day a suit was filed, and without issuing notice to co-sharers, who were not made parties to the suit.","Allahabad hc found that using the judicial process, the court clerk threw out a woman and her three children from the house using the sale deed signed by her husband in a drunken stupor.

"NEET-PG cut-off overhaul in Delhi: Centre lowers qualifying percentile to fill 9,000 vacant seats",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neet-pg-cut-off-score-now-fixed-at-40-out-of-800/articleshow/126514156.cms,"NEW DELHI: The government on Tuesday lowered qualifying cut-off for NEET-PG 2025, paving the way to fill over 9,000 vacant PG medical seats, amid concerns that a big chunk of training capacity was being wasted at a time of acute doctor shortages.Under the revised criteria, qualifying percentile for general and EWS candidates has been reduced from 50th to 7th percentile, and for general persons with benchmark disability (PwBD) from 45th to 5th percentile. For SC, ST and OBC candidates, the percentile has been reduced from 40 to zero, with the corresponding cut-off score fixed at -40 out of 800 (due to negative marking).The decision was notified by National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences (NBEMS), which revised qualifying percentiles across categories to expand eligibility for counselling and admissions. Officials said around 2.4 lakh candidates appeared for NEET-PG this year, but a high cut-off had left thousands of seats unfilled.Officials said India has 65,000-70,000 PG medical seats, and allowing nearly one in seven seats to remain vacant would weaken teaching hospitals and strain healthcare delivery, particularly in govt institutions that rely heavily on resident doctors. The relaxation followed a representation by Indian Medical Association (IMA), which had written to Union health minister JP Nadda on Jan 12, seeking a rational revision of cut-offs to prevent large-scale vacancies.Explaining the move, NBEMS officials said the entrance exam is meant to generate a merit list, not to reassess the competence of doctors who have already cleared MBBS and university exams. ""You can't afford to let 9,000-10,000 PG seats go to waste,"" an official said.The official acknowledged that sharp percentile reductions attract criticism but said the admission cycle was already delayed. ""Earlier, cut-offs were lowered in stages. This time, we are late. The focus is to fill seats and avoid losing national medical resources,"" he said.NBEMS clarified that the cut-off change does not alter exam scores or ranks, but only decides who is eligible to participate in counselling. Officials said the percentile system is used to rank already qualified doctors, and the cut-off was lowered simply to ensure enough candidates are available to fill all PG seats.IMA warned that vacant PG seats worsen resident doctor shortages, increase workload, disrupt academics and hurt patient care, especially in government and peripheral hospitals.","Government lowers qualifying cut-off for neet-pg 2025, paving the way to fill over 9,000 vacant pg medical seats.

Love, Anger, Fear, Sympathy: How Indians See Stray Dogs | I Witness

NEW DELHI: As dog lovers and feeders are pressing Supreme Court to roll back its order on making public institutions free of strays, the apex court on Tuesday asked them whether they can take responsibility in case of injury or death caused by stray dog bites and indicated that it will fix heavy compensation for victims.""For every dog bite, death or injury caused to children or elderly, we are going to fix heavy compensation for the victim to be paid by the state for not doing anything. Also, liability and accountability on those who are saying we are feeding dogs. Why should dogs be loitering around, biting, scaring people?...Who should be held accountable when dogs attack a nine-year-old? The organisation that is feeding them? You want us to shut our eyes to the problem?"" the court asked.Hearing the stray dogs issue for the fourth day, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria observed that people are very sympathetic towards stray dogs but not so towards homeless people and orphans as no one comes forward to take care of them. The hearing in the case has so far taken nine hours and still remains inconclusive. Around three dozen activists and lawyers have till now argued in the case.SC said those who are interested in feeding stray dogs should think of adopting them and keep them in their homes.The bench said arguments in court were going on and on, and observed that it has become a public platform for them - animal lovers - rather than for court proceedings. It said that the court wanted to take the Centre, states and municipal bodies to task for failure to implement the law to deal with the problem of strays, but it has not been able to do so because of large number of people turning up to argue the case which is repetitive in nature.""Our request to all the lawyers is to allow us to take to task the Union, state authorities and other bodies on steps taken by them. Allow us to pass an order. We need to spend half a day with the states and the Union. To see whether they have a plan of action or not. The problem has multiplied a thousand times. We just want implementation of statutory provision. Allow us to do that. Allow us to work. Allow us to proceed further. The same things are coming again and again. This has become a public platform rather than a court proceeding,"" the bench said.As some of the lawyers alleged that it would cost around Rs 26,000 crore to remove all strays from institutions and keep them in shelter homes, and urged the court that the amount could be better used for homeless people, SC said that why people, who are so sympathetic to animals, do not reach out to homeless people and support them.""A young counsel just showed us statistics of orphans on the streets. Perhaps some lawyers could argue for adoption of those children. Since 2011, since I was elevated to SC, these are the longest arguments I have heard. And, till now no one has argued so long for human beings,"" Justice Mehta observed.Senior advocate Arvind Datar, Vikas Singh, Pinky Anand, Menaka Guruswamy, Percival Billimoria along with others argued the case. The hearing will resume on Thursday.","Sc said those who are interested in feeding stray dogs should think of adopting them and keep them in their homes.

NEW DELHI: Election Commission on Tuesday told Supreme Court that scrutiny of citizenship during SIR of voter lists was only meant to ensure deletion of non-citizens from electoral rolls and did not extend to termination of citizenship or deportation. EC, through senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, told a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that Article 326 of the Constitution mandated that only Indian citizens were entitled to be included in the electoral rolls.For this purpose and this alone, EC was entitled to inquire and conclude whether a person was an Indian citizen, entitling him to be a voter. ""If a person is found not to be a citizen of India by EC, then his name will either not be included in the voter list or, if it is there, then it would be struck off,"" he said.Dwivedi said no person with a shadow of doubt over citizenship could be included in the voter list. However, such a determination by the Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) would not automatically result in a declaration that s/he was not a citizen of India - which was the domain of the competent authorities. ""The ERO's conclusion about a voter's citizenship being doubtful and the resultant removal of his name from the voter list can be set aside by a court of law only if it finds that the procedure adopted for such determination was perverse and illegal,"" he said.""Under the SIR exercise, the citizenship of an individual for the purposes of Citizenship Act, 1955, will not terminate on account of the fact that he/she is held to be ineligible for registration in the electoral rolls,"" EC said.Since the documents that could be used to establish citizenship were within a person knowledge, the burden of proof lay with the individual, it said.Dwivedi said when doubts arose about an elected representative's citizenship, the President or the governor was constitutionally bound by EC's opinion on whether the MP or MLA had incurred disqualification over being a non-citizen. This meant EC had the power to inquire into citizenship of MPs or MLAs if doubts arose, he said.Arguments in the matter will resume Thursday.","Election commission says scrutiny of citizenship during sir only meant to ensure deletion of non-citizens from electoral rolls.
