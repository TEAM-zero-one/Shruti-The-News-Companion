NEW DELHI: Security forces conducted a comprehensive joint mock drill on Monday at Yatri Niwas, the base camp for the Amarnath Yatra in J&K, as a preemptive measure to ensure safety during the upcoming Amarnath Yatra. Buses were sent under full security cover to test preparedness.The first batch of pilgrims will be flagged off from the Jammu base camp on July 2. The Yatra will formally begin on July 3 via both the Baltal and Pahalgam routes.Speaking to reporters, Deputy Commissioner of Jammu, Sachin Kumar Vaishy, said all preparations for the Yatra have been completed. “Today, tokens will be distributed at Saraswati Dham. We appeal to people to come in large numbers; we will provide them with all the necessary facilities, and no one will face any issues. We have full preparations for everything,” he said.The exercise aimed to assess emergency preparedness in the event of landslides or other natural disasters during the pilgrimage and to ensure a prompt response in case of any unfortunate incident. The simulation involved rescuing stranded vehicles and providing immediate aid to injured pilgrims, with security and disaster response teams efficiently coordinating evacuation and medical assistance.Earlier, on Sunday, a joint mock landslide drill was conducted by the Indian Army CRPF , J&K Police, and the Jammu and Kashmir State Disaster Response Force (JKSDRF) in parts of Samroli and Toldi Nallah along the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway, one of the critical routes for the Yatra.The CRPF has intensified surveillance by deploying K-9 (dog) squads alongside its personnel on key routes used by thousands of pilgrims and has strengthened highway patrols, with special focus on sensitive stretches such as the Udhampur sector.Meanwhile, Director General of Police (J&K) Nalin Prabhat held a joint security review meeting in Udhampur on Saturday ahead of the Yatra, which will continue until August 9. The meeting was convened to review preparations and enhance coordination among all agencies involved in ensuring the safety of pilgrims.Addressing the meeting, the DGP emphasised the need for officers to maintain very close coordination, describing it as crucial to ensuring an incident-free Yatra.He directed that zonal and sectoral officers must have up-to-date information about the availability and location of special teams such as Drone Units, Bomb Disposal Squads, Dog Squads and Quick Response Teams (QRTs), to ensure these teams can be deployed in real time in case of any emergency.",Joint mock drill conducted to ensure safety of pilgrims ahead of amarnath yatra.

Indore: Madhya Pradesh DGP Kailash Makwana highlighted that police action alone is insufficient to prevent sexual assault cases, pointing to declining social values attributed to widespread access to explicit content through digital devices and internet connectivity.Addressing media Saturday about rising sexual assault cases, the DGP said, ""There are many reasons why I believe this is happening - availability of internet, mobile phones, obscene content, alcohol. Through mobile phones, anyone can connect with anyone from anywhere. There is a serious decline in morality. There are many such reasons, and to expect the police to handle all of this alone is not possible.""Makwana said domestic supervision has weakened considerably. ""Within homes, people are no longer able to keep a watch on each other. Many of the boundaries have been broken, and the kind of obscenity being served through the internet from a young age is undoubtedly distorting children's minds.

Previously, the maximum number of Naxals eliminated in a year stood at six,” the DGP said.The meeting included senior officials from Indore commissionerate and SP and DSP-ranked officers from all eight districts in Indore range. The DGP said, “While Naxal problem remains widespread in Chhattisgarh, the issue in MP is restricted to Balaghat and Mandla. Among these, Balaghat continues to be most affected.

Congress has appointed 8,586 BLAs, CPI(ML) (Liberation) 233, CPM 76, and BS.BJP allies JDU, Lok Janshakti Party and Rashtriya Lok Samta Party have appointed 27,931, 2,457 and 264 BLAs, respectively, taking the total deployment by NDA to 82,616 BLAs.EC sources told TOI on Sunday that all parties are in the process of appointing more BLAs for proper verification of electoral rolls.EC officials, despite facing criticism of SIR as an attempt at “disenfranchisement”, sought to make it clear Sunday that the poll body will strictly implement Article 326 during the exercise. The Article, a senior EC functionary told TOI, casts a constitutional duty on the commission to enrol only those who are Indian citizens above 18 years of age, ordinary resident in the assembly constituency concerned and not disqualified under any law as an elector.“SIR is in line with Article 326. It’s a straight question (to the parties criticising SIR): Do you agree with Article 326 or not,” asked the functionary.EC has already advised all recognised political parties in Bihar to appoint their workers as BLAs in polling stations “now rather than finding faults with the electoral rolls later”, as per the senior EC functionary.Electoral registration officers (EROs) have started conducting orientation workshops for BLAs of all parties to explain the process and sensitise them about SIR.The BLA for a polling station will be associated with the booth level officer (BLO) during the revision period. Political parties would also be asked to give a list of BLAs to respective their EROs.Before house-to-house enumeration, a BLO will hold a meeting with BLAs appointed by political parties and brief them about the schedule and process of SIR. BLOs will go through the draft electoral roll with BLAs and identify corrections to be carried out.“It is pertinent to mention that BLAs once appointed by a recognised political party will continue as BLA, unless their appointment is rescinded revoked by the political party concerned,” as per EC instructions on SIR in Bihar issued last week.EC has allowed BLAs to file applications in bulk, subject to the condition that a BLA would not submit more than 50 forms per day to a BLO before the draft roll publication, and 10 forms per day thereafter.BLAs will submit a list of application forms with an undertaking that he or she has personally verified the particulars of the application forms and is satisfied that they are correct.","Rjd has appointed 47,143 blas, making it second only to bjp that has positioned 51,964 blas in the field.

Once the (probe) report comes, we will be able to ascertain if it was an engine problem or fuel supply issue, or why both the engines had stopped functioning.

The Barduar township, set on about 1,500 acre surrounding a British-era tea garden in Kamrup district, would transform a largely tribal area into a suburban hub on Guwahati's outskirts.""There are some people who love protesting,"" Sarma said on the sidelines of an event.

NEW DELHI: A husband-wife spat reportedly turned so ugly on an Amritsar-Delhi flight Saturday and when a co-passenger tried to intervene, the man ended up having the fight with the latter too.

Fadnavis defends Hindi move, cites Uddhav-era panel’s report

MUMBAI: Buffeted by an anti-Hindi campaign led by the Thackeray cousins, CM Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday announced that the state cabinet had decided to scrap two Govt Resolutions (GRs) to introduce Hindi as a third language for class 1 students.The announcement came on a day when public protests against introducing Hindi in primary schools started with Uddhav Thackeray present at a symbolic burning of the GRs at Azad Maidan. A stormy start was also expected to the monsoon session of the state legislature on Monday.Announcing a rollback, the CM also set up a panel led by academic Narendra Jadhav to frame recommendations for implementing a three-language policy. ""Our policy is Marathi-centric and Marathi student-centric. We do not wish to do politics on this issue,"" said Fadnavis.Following the announcement, the Thackerays called off a joint protest rally to be held on July 5 and instead hold a 'victory procession'. Both Shiv Sena (UBT) and Raj Thackeray's Maharashtra Navnirman Sena had described the move to start Hindi lessons in primary school as a 'linguistic imposition'.Announcing a rollback, Fadnavis cited recommendations of the Mashelkar committee set up by his predecessor in 2020 to defend his govt's move.He said Thackeray formed the expert panel to guide the administration on adopting the new National Education Policy. He said the report was accepted by Thackeray, Congress and NCP (SP) when in power. ""But as usual when in power speak differently, when out of power speak differently. Opposition for opposition sake,"" he added.Raj Thackeray must ask Uddhav Thackeray if he gave approval then how has he set out to hold an agitation now,” Fadnavis added.The state govt has been under pressure from its own Language Advisory Committee, which passed a resolution that no third language including Hindi be taught before Class 5. The opposition led by the Thackeray cousins had then announced a morcha against the introduction of Hindi on July 5. Several litterateurs and celebrities had announced their decision to join the morcha as also the Congress and the NCP (SP).Defending the GR for the third language, the CM said the Mashelkar committee set up during the tenure of Uddhav Thackeray submitted a 101-page report recommending such a move. The committee was led by scientist Raghunath Mashelkar and had a sub-committee which included Shiksha Vidya Prabodhini founder Vijay Kadam, a ‘deputy leader’ of Sena (UBT), he added.“Point number 8.1 (of the report) states English and Hindi languages should be implemented as second languages from first standard onwards. If students learn English for 12 years from first to twelfth standard, they will develop proficiency in English and be able to read necessary books. They will be prepared for engineering, medical and other technical-professional courses. While priority must be given to teaching in Marathi in higher education institutions, English and Hindi as second languages should be made compulsory from first standard to 12th. If needed, they should also be made compulsory in the 3 or 4-year degree courses of college education,” said Fadnavis, quoting from the report.He said that the new panel will study the Mashelkar report and engage with those opposed to the policy before making recommendations. The other members of the committee will be announced shortly and the committee will submit its report in three months, he said.Explaining the evolution of the three-language policy, he said the NEP was first adopted by Karnataka followed by MP, Telangana and UP. “On 21 Sept, 2020 then CM Uddhav Thackeray announced the setting up of an expert committee on how to apply this NEP.” Fadnavis said after the report was submitted on Sept 14, 2021, it came before the cabinet on Jan 20, 2022. Its minutes were confirmed on Jan 7, 2022 and signed by CM Thackeray. There is no mention of keeping aside the three-language policy,” said Fadnavis.“It is not true when some say the report was not accepted. The report was accepted and to implement it, a committee was set up to frame rules. In our tenure following the work of the committee the GRs were issued. We issued the first GR on 16 April, 2025 mentioning Marathi as compulsory followed by English as second language and Hindi as third language. There was an uproar and a second GR was issued on 17 June 2025 and in that we said any Indian language can be studied as a third language. Marathi is compulsory. The study of a third language is not from Std I. It is only an oral study, reading and writing is from Std III. Our govt did not take the decision, we did not make Hindi compulsory, rather (we) gave the option of any Indian language,” said Fadnavis.Fadnavis said when govt issued the second GR it was made clear they wanted to implement it through consensus and the education minister had begun holding consultations.After the CM’s press meet, deputy CM Ajit Pawar urged opposition to call off the July 5 morcha and not inconvenience people in Mumbai. “The reason for holding the morcha is no longer there,” he said.Following the CM’s announcement, MNS chief Raj Thackeray said, “This imposition was withdrawn solely due to strong resistance from the Marathi people. Why govt was so insistent on pushing Hindi and from where exactly this pressure was coming still remains a mystery.” He said the govt has once again appointed a new committee. “Let me say this in clear terms: whether the report of this committee comes or not, such things will no longer be tolerated. ”","Cm devendra fadnavis defends hindi move, cites uddhav-era panel’s report.

Mumbai's iconic Parsi eatery shuts before 100th anniversery,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mumbais-iconic-parsi-eatery-shuts-before-100th-anniversery/articleshow/122137364.cms,"TOI

MUMBAI: Jimmy Boy, the legendary Parsi restaurant tucked into the heart of Fort, was just months away from turning 100 years. Known for its Keema Pav, Brun Maska, Mava Cakes, and nostalgic Irani chai, the eatery has long been a culinary landmark in south Mumbai. But the dream of ringing in a centenary celebration at its original location came crashing down — quite literally — on the evening of June 20.According to civic records, on June 20 a call was registered with the BMC disaster management helpline by junior engineer of the building and factory department stating that cracks had developed in the ground plus four storey commercial building Vikas Premises whose ground floor houses this eatery. As per further details for safety reasons, the building had been vacated. “A formal notice has been issued instructing all occupants to vacate immediately and restricting further occupancy until structural safety is ensured,” stated a civic official.has a copy of the notice served to the owner of the building on June 21, under section 354 of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act 1888. However the notice further read that the said consultant came on site at around 08:25 pm on June 20.“He informed that he had given Structural Audit report to the society, about a year before, informing therein to carry out immediate structural repairs however till date the society has not taken any remedial measure. A letter dated June 21 of M/s. Mahimtura Consultants Pvt. Ltd. is received to this office along with Proforma – B of Structural Audit Report and photographs showing conditions of the structure, wherein the said consultant has mentioned his various observations showing that the structural condition of building has become extremely dilapidated,” stated the notice.When contacted, Shehzad Irani, Director of Operations at Jimmy Boy, said that the Fort premises had been the heart of their operations. “In September 2025, we complete 100 years. We’ve been operating from the same premises, with the same family managing it. It was known as Café India until 1999, serving all-day breakfast and tea. The name was later changed to Jimmy Boy, where we began offering our full Parsi food menu. We had a few plans for our centenary celebrations, especially to give back to our patrons in some way. However, we hadn’t finalised anything yet,” he said.Irani added that Café Olive Green, run by the Army in Navy Nagar, is being serviced by Jimmy Boy, and patrons can enjoy cakes, sandwiches, and puffs there as well. Apart from this, they are also operating out of their Mahim premises, which has takeaway option only. Since the closure of the Fort branch, they have extended their delivery radius through online food aggregators.""While the Fort branch remains shut due to the ongoing structural issue, the case is being handled legally and we’re staying positive. Though this feels like a speed breaker, we hope to bounce back stronger. At the heart of everything, our aim remains to serve authentic Parsi food and give back to the city that made us who we are,"" he said.TOI tried to contact the owner of Vikas Premises, but the manager said he would only be available to comment on Monday.Pinky Janak Ganjawala, a landlord of a building in South Mumbai, expressed concern that even structurally sound buildings are being served notices simply due to their age. “Just because a building is old doesn’t mean it’s unsafe,” she said. Citing Section 79A of the MHADA Act, she noted that if owners fail to act within months of a danger notice, MHADA can take over redevelopment without tenant or owner consent. “In most cases, landlords and tenants aren’t aligned — and this process feels unfair to us,” she added.","Jimmy boy, the legendary parsi restaurant tucked into the heart of fort, was just months away from turning 100 years.

KOLKATA: The hockey stick with which ex-Trinamool Chhatra Parishad union president Manojit Mishra inflicted a head injury on the 24-year-old Kolkata law student he and two others allegedly gang-raped on campus last Wednesday now sits inside an evidence bag at Lalbazar, the city police headquarters. So do the red kurta, light brown six-pocket trousers and black shorts the prime suspect was purportedly wearing during the crime.In four days since the assault, Kolkata Police's special investigation team has moved with urgency and meticulousness that contrast with its contentious handling of the RG Kar Medical College rape-murder case last Aug. Police said Sunday they had collected DNA samples from all three suspects and seized items of clothing from their homes in Kalighat, Tiljala and Howrah, reports Tamaghna Banerjee.From the guard room floor where the crime occurred, forensic teams have retrieved hair strands, said to be evidence of how the survivor fought back before giving up. ""I just lay like a dead body,"" she wrote in her complaint.Police said Sunday they had collected DNA samples from all three suspects and seized items of clothing from their homes in Kalighat, Tiljala and Howrah.From the guard room floor where the crime occurred, forensic teams have retrieved hair strands, said to be evidence of how the survivor fought back before giving up.“I just lay like a dead body,” she wrote in her complaint.The real smoking gun? Mishra’s cellphone. Co-suspects Zaib Ahmed and Pramit Mukherjee – both law students – allegedly filmed the assault on Mishra’s orders, making sure to capture the survivor’s face clearly in the frame. Those videos, sent for verification to the cyber forensics lab in Kolkata’s Salt Lake, tell a story that contradicts Mishra’s claims of “consensual sex” with the woman whose refusal to accept his marriage proposal allegedly triggered the assault.CCTV footage backs the survivor’s version of what happened between 7.30pm and 10.50pm Wednesday. Cameras captured her bolting for the main gate, only to be dragged back to the guard room. They also caught the colour of Mishra’s kurta, later matched to the one seized from his Kalighat home.Based on the footage, investigators have calculated that 25 students were on campus that day, and seven were in the union room just before the assault. Police have asked authorities of the south Kolkata law college to provide their names, phone numbers and addresses.Mishra’s phone also revealed more than just Wednesday’s horror. Sources said investigators found what his circle already knew — a cache of doctored photos of female students, their faces superimposed on pornographic images and shared on WhatsApp groups.The nine-member SIT led by an officer of the rank of assistant commissioner spent Sunday at Pramit’s Howrah home, combing through his computer for more videos. Neighbours protested, but the team – bolstered by the addition of four sub-inspectors, one of them a woman officer – stayed put for two hours. What they found there is still to be disclosed.Sources said a relative of the survivor’s family told police that they were satisfied with the probe for now and are expecting a speedy trial.",Kolkata police's special investigation team has moved with urgency and meticulousness that contrast with its contentious handling of the rg kar medical college rape-murder case last aug. police said sunday they had collected dna samples from all three suspects and seized items of clothing from their homes.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122148412,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1546340,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Barely three months after their previous public spat, Trinamool Congress (TMC) MPs Kalyan Banerjee and Mahua Moitra are once again engaged in a war of words, this time over Banerjee's controversial comments on the alleged gang-rape case at South Calcutta Law College.Banerjee, while responding to Moitra’s criticism, targeted her personal life, referring to her marriage with former Biju Janata Dal (BJD) MP Pinaki Misra. ""Mahua has come back to India after her honeymoon and started fighting with me! She accuses me of being anti-woman. What is she? She has broken up a 40-year marriage and married a guy who is 65 years old.

What differentiates @AITCofficial is that we condemn these disgusting comments no matter who makes them.""Banerjee, in a statement on Friday, had said, ""What can be done if a friend rapes his friend? Will the police be there in schools? This was done by students to another student. Who will protect her?""Also read: In controversial remark, TMC's Kalyan Banerjee says 'What can be done if ...

According to the 24-year-old survivor, three men -- Manojit Mishra, Pramit Mukherjee, and Zaib Ahmed -- took her to a guard’s room inside the law college, raped her, filmed the assault, and threatened to leak the video. She said she was confined for over three hours and was hit with a hockey stick when she resisted.All three accused were arrested within 24 hours. Mishra, a former office-bearer of the Trinamool Chhatra Parishad, was working on a temporary contract at the college and is a practising lawyer. The security guard, Pinaki Banerjee, has also been arrested. The accused are in police custody until July 1. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) has been set up.The National Commission for Women (NCW) has taken suo motu cognisance and demanded a time-bound investigation.
