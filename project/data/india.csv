NEW DELHI: Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren on Tuesday penned a heartfelt tribute to his father and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) founder Shibu Soren, following his death at the age of 81, calling it the ""most toughest time of his life. ""Shibu Soren, popularly known as ‘Dishom Guru’, was a towering figure in Indian tribal politics and played a key role in the movement for Jharkhand’s statehood.He passed away on Monday at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in New Delhi after a prolonged illness.Sharing a post on X, Soren described the immense personal and public loss, stating that beyond losing a father, Jharkhand has lost a crucial leader.""I am going through the toughest days of my life. Not only has the shadow of a father been taken from me, but a pillar of Jharkhand's soul has departed,"" Hemant Soren posted on X.""I didn't just call him 'Baba,' He was my guide, the root of my thoughts, and that forest-like shade that protected thousands and lakhs of Jharkhandis from the scorching sun and injustice,"" he continued.Recalling his father's humble beginnings, he said that his father was, ""born in that small house in Nemra village, where there was poverty, there was hunger, but there was courage.In his childhood, he lost his father. The exploitation of the landlords gave him a fire that made him a fighter for his entire life.""The Jharkhand CM further reflected on how his father led not through words alone but by living the struggles of the people.""I have seen him tilling the fields, sitting among the people, not just giving speeches, but living the sorrows of the people,"" he said.Explaining the origin of the title 'Dishom Guru', Hemant shared a childhood memory saying, ""In my childhood, when I asked him, 'Baba, why do people call you Dishom Guru?' He would smile and say: 'Because, son, I only understood their pain and made their fight my own.'""""That title was not written in any book, nor was it given by Parliament. It came from the hearts of Jharkhand's people,"" Soren added.He also explained the meaning behind the name: ""'Dishom' means society, 'Guru' means the one who shows the way.""He also praised his father's fearless commitment to justice, saying that he was not afraid of ""taking on the mightiest of the mighty.""""I was scared, but Baba was never afraid. He would say: 'If standing against injustice is a crime, then I will be guilty again and again.' No book can explain Baba's struggle. It was in his sweat, in his voice, and in the cracked heels covered by his sandals,"" Hemant said.He recalled his father's humility even after Jharkhand achieved statehood. ""When Jharkhand became a state, His dream came true, but he never considered power an achievement. He said: ""This state is not a throne for me, It is the identity of my people.""Hemant ended his note by acknowledging his father's fighting spirit, stating that his presence would continue in every aspect of Jharkhand's existence.""The dream you saw is now my promise. I will not let Jharkhand bow down; I will not let your name fade away. Your struggle will not remain incomplete. Baba, now you rest. You have fulfilled your duty. Now we must walk in your footsteps. Jharkhand will remain indebted to you. I, your son, will keep your promise,"" the CM noted.Shibu Soren leaves behind a legacy of struggle, sacrifice, and unwavering dedication to the cause of tribal empowerment in India. The emotional tribute came, as leaders across the political spectrum paid their respects to a the veteran leader.The final rites of the three-time Jharkhand chief minister will take place in Jharkhand on Tuesday.","Shibu soren, popularly known as ‘dishom guru’, was a towering figure in indian tribal politics and played a key role in the movement for jharkhand’s statehood.

HC: Past overstays cannot be reason to deny furlough,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-past-overstays-cannot-be-reason-to-deny-furlough/articleshow/123106118.cms,".

Nagpur: In a ruling underscoring the rehabilitative purpose of furlough, Nagpur bench of Bombay high court quashed prison department's refusal to grant leave to a life convict, stating that past overstays on furlough (leave of absence for a specified period to a convict from prison) cannot permanently disqualify a prisoner from exercising the right to temporary release.A division bench comprising Justices Anil Pansare and Mahendra Nerlikar was hearing a plea filed by Shankar Landge, a 38-year-old serving life imprisonment at Nagpur Central Jail, following his conviction by a Wardha court on murder charges in 2010.""The very object of the furlough is reformation and social integration and, therefore, if it is denied for years together, it would frustrate the purpose of incorporation of provisions in the rules,"" the bench stated in its order last week.The judges said the jail superintendent also lost sight of the fact that since 2014, the petitioner had not been granted furlough. ""Merely because he overstayed on earlier occasions, that by itself does not disqualify the petitioner from the grant of furlough leave,"" the HC ruled.The petitioner's furlough request was rejected on March 22 by DIG (Prisons), Nagpur, citing multiple instances of overstay between 2010 and 2014.Landge challenged the decision in high court. Opposing his plea, public prosecutor S Thakur informed the bench that the convict had overstayed his release by 18 days in 2010, 88 days in 2011, 265 days in 2013 and 56 days in 2014.The court, however, noted that Landge had not been granted furlough since Nov 18, 2014. His counsel argued that the past overstays - now over a decade old - should not weigh against him indefinitely. The petitioner also gave an undertaking that he would diligently perform his allotted prison duties, addressing another concern flagged by the prison authorities.Allowing the petition, the court directed Landge to be released on furlough for the period he had applied for, on terms and conditions deemed appropriate by the prison authorities.","Bombay high court quashes prison department's refusal to grant leave to a life convict.

"In motor accidents, claims not restricted to third party, says SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-motor-accidents-claims-not-restricted-to-third-party-says-sc/articleshow/123105796.cms,"New Delhi: Motor vehicle insurance protects a policyholder against claims made by a third party for damages due to the policyholder's actions, but what about the claim against injury/death of the policyholder themselves in a road accident? Holding that family members of such a policyholder can also claim compensation, Supreme Court has referred the issue to a larger bench since there are contradictory verdicts of the apex court on the matter.While hearing the compensation plea of a minor girl who lost both her parents in a car accident in which her father was on the driving seat, a bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and K Vinod Chandran said section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act could be invoked for such a claim, as it is a special provision which overrides not only all the provisions of the Act but also any other law in force for the time being.In this case, the minor was awarded compensation by the insurance company for the death of her mother but not for her father as he was himself the insured party.The bench said: ""... a claim under section 163A, as per the words employed in the provision, according to us covers every claim and is not restricted to a third party claim; without any requirement of establishing the negligence, if death or permanent disability is caused by reason of the motor accident. This would also take in the liability with respect to the death of an owner or a driver who stepped into the shoes of the owner, if the claim is made under section 163A dehors the statutory liability under section 147 or the contractual liability as reduced to writing in an insurance policy"".The insurance company, however, took the stand that the petitioner, having succeeded to the estate of the owner of the vehicle who died in the accident cannot at the same time be the person who has the liability and is the recipient of the compensation.""It would override the provisions under sections 147 & 149 along with the other provisions of the Act and the law regulating insurance as also the terms of the policy confining the claim with respect to an owner-driver to a fixed sum. This according to us is the intention of incorporating the non-obstante clause under Section 163A providing for no-fault liability claims, the compensation for which is restricted to the structured formula under the IInd Schedule. It is a beneficial piece of legislation brought in, keeping in mind the enhanced chances of an accident, resulting from the prevalence of vehicles in the overcrowded roads of today. It was a social security scheme, brought about considering the need for a more comprehensive scheme of 'no-fault' liability for reasons of the ever-increasing instances of motor vehicle accidents and the difficulty in proving rash and negligent driving,"" the bench said.",The supreme court has referred the issue to a larger bench since there are contradictory verdicts of the apex court on the matter.

SC proposes panel to manage Banke Bihari temple till HC decides on UP ordinance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-proposes-panel-to-manage-banke-bihari-temple-till-hc-decides-on-up-ordinance/articleshow/123105718.cms,".

New Delhi: Supreme Court on Monday proposed an interim committee, headed by a retired high court judge and comprising the district collector and Goswamis (pujaris), for management of Banke Bihari temple in Vrindavan till Allahabad HC decides the validity of UP govt's ordinance for all-round development of the temple area to provide facilities to pilgrims.A bench of justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi asked additional solicitor general K M Nataraj to seek state govt's response by Tuesday morning, when it will take up a batch of petitions that have questioned the manner in which state govt, prompted by an SC order, had come out with a temple development project proposed to be implemented at a cost of Rs 500 crore.The Goswamis, through senior advocate Shyam Divan, said taking over of the temple through an ordinance was extraordinary as the issue was not before constitutional courts, which were only dealing with alleged mismanagement of Guriraj temple. In the guise of better management of temples in the 'Braj area', the SC passed an order without even hearing temple Goswamis, which prompted the state to issue the ordinance, they said.The bench agreed that such an order without hearing the Goswamis could not have been passed. However, the Justice Kant-led bench said, ""It is only for development of the temple and its surroundings. The state's intention does not appear to siphon out temple funds but to spend it on providing facilities to pilgrims.""Divan said Banke Bihari temple was a private temple and any law brought about by govt or any order passed by courts could not have been without hearing the Goswamis, who have been managing it for centuries.The bench saw a point in Divan's argument and said, ""The state cannot be seen coming to the court in a clandestine manner and getting an order set aside in a case which had nothing to do with Banke Bihari temple. We will set aside that part of the order, set up an interim committee to manage the temple and permit the HC to decide the legality of the ordinance.""However, the bench was in favour of development around the temple to provide space for parking and places to stay for pilgrims with all facilities. ""Religious tourism is assuming great importance. It can also be a big revenue earner and help in job creation. But there has to be adequate facilities to handle pilgrims,"" it said.The interim committee may also have to induct representatives of Archaeological Survey of India as well as independent architects proficient in ancient building restoration to protect the temple, the bench said.",Supreme court proposes an interim committee for management of banke bihari temple in vrindavan.

'Nazi' BJP Targeting 'Bengalis': TMC MP Mahua Moitra's Explosive Interview On Gurugram Crackdown

NEW DELHI: Senior Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Kalyan Banerjee has resigned from his position as the party’s chief whip in the Lok Sabha, news agency PTI reported on Monday, citing party sources. His resignation comes against the backdrop of an ongoing public feud with fellow party MP Mahua Moitra.Just minutes before the news of his resignation emerged, Banerjee, who represents Serampore in the Lok Sabha, took to social media platform X to criticise Moitra over her alleged remarks made during a recent public podcast. He accused her of using ""dehumanising language"" and compared her comments to “outright abuse.”“I have taken note of the recent personal remarks made by Ms Mahua Moitra in a public podcast... comparing a fellow MP to a 'pig' reflects a deep disregard for basic norms of civil discourse,” Banerjee posted.He defended his earlier statements, saying they focused on questions of public accountability and conduct, and were not misogynistic. He added, “Labeling a male colleague as ‘sexually frustrated’ isn’t boldness, it’s outright abuse.”Banerjee further claimed that Moitra was using personal attacks to deflect from questions regarding her performance as an MP. He said, “Those who rely on abuse instead of answers are not champions of democracy, they are its embarrassment.”The fallout between the two senior TMC leaders reportedly began in April, when Moitra confronted Banerjee inside the Parliament building after her name was left out from a party delegation memorandum. That incident reportedly led to a tense exchange in front of other MPs and party members.Following that, Banerjee accused Moitra of asking security personnel to arrest him and described her as ""rude"" and ""uncivilised.""

Yes, I support the Supreme Court's intervention. No, the government should manage it.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday questioned the Uttar Pradesh government's move to take over the management of the Shri Banke Bihari temple in Vrindavan, stating that key stakeholders had not been heard before the May 15 order allowing the corridor project was passed.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi questioned the state’s decision-making, particularly the urgency with which it enacted the Uttar Pradesh Shri Bankey Bihari Ji Temple Trust Ordinance, 2025. “What stopped you from acquiring the entire land and properties from your corpus in public interest? What was the tearing hurry in enacting the ordinance, when the matter was sub-judice? Providing basic amenities and developing the area is the duty of the state. There are numerous instances where the state’s participation has helped in developing the religious places like in Golden Temple in Amritsar,” the bench observed.The court said it would pass orders on August 5 to put the May 15 direction in abeyance and appoint a retired high court or district judge to oversee daily management of the temple. The proposed committee would also include other stakeholders and focus on managing the temple and surrounding areas.The bench expressed concern about the state approaching the court without informing key parties. “Less said the better. How do you justify the directions passed by the court? The state in the most unfortunate way came to the court in the most clandestine manner without informing the court receiver or stakeholders... Get the directions behind their back and set aside the order of the high court. This is the least thing we expect from the state,” the bench said.At present, the court is not examining the constitutionality of the ordinance. That issue will be taken up by the Allahabad High Court. The top court will instead look into interim arrangements for managing the temple and adjacent developments.“This is the land of Lord Krishna. He was the first mediator known to the world. Let’s find a way out to resolve the dispute pending for years and develop the area in the interest of lakhs of devotees who visit these iconic religious places. Basic amenities need to be created as nowadays religious tourism is one of the biggest sources of revenue,” the bench added.During the hearing, Additional Solicitor General K M Nataraj, representing the state, said a member of the Goswami community had approached the court but was not supported by others. The bench questioned why all warring factions were not heard and asked whether the court receiver in charge of temple management had been consulted.The court also questioned the state’s use of temple funds for acquiring five acres of land for a holding area. It asked why public funds were not used instead and again raised concern about the urgency of the ordinance when the matter was already under judicial consideration.Senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for the temple’s managing committee, said the order had been passed without giving them an opportunity to be heard. He said since it was a private temple, notice to them was necessary.The court responded by stating that the term “private temple” was not applicable in this context, given the scale of public involvement and the number of devotees who visit annually.The top court asked Nataraj to seek instructions from the state and adjourned the matter to August 5. It clarified that the High Court would examine the legality of the ordinance and that the Supreme Court would adjust its May 15 directions accordingly.Petitioners, including members of the managing committee, have been asked to submit suggestions on how the temple affairs should be managed during the interim period.The plea, filed through advocate Tanvi Dubey on behalf of the temple's management committee, challenges the ordinance which hands over control of the temple to a state-administered trust.On May 15, the Supreme Court had allowed the Uttar Pradesh government’s impleadment application and permitted the development of a temple corridor at Vrindavan, using temple funds. That order may now be placed on hold pending further directions.(With inputs form agencies)",The supreme court questioned the uttar pradesh government's move to take over the management of the shri banke bihari temple. A bench of justices surya kant and joymalya bagchi questioned the state’s decision-making. The court said it would pass orders on august 5 to put the may 15 direction in abeyance and appoint a retired high court or district judge to oversee daily management.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123095853,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-117162,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Telangana car owners may not benefit from Centre’s Annual Toll Pass scheme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/telangana-car-owners-may-not-benefit-from-centres-annual-toll-pass-scheme/articleshow/123079938.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Private car owners in Telangana won’t be able to avail the Annual Toll Pass scheme for National Highways (NHs) and expressways to be launched by the Centre on Aug 15, as vehicles registered in the state have not yet been migrated to the Vahan database (central registry of vehicles). The annual pass, to be issued from next week, requires real-time validation of vehicle class through the Vahan portal.Union transport secretary V Umashankar, in a letter addressed to Telangana chief secretary last week, sought the “personal intervention” of the top state official to expedite the migration of the state’s vehicle data to Vahan portal and ensure “equitable access to the nationwide facility for road users”.In his letter, Umashankar highlighted how the Centre had reached out to the state govt in May this year for merger of state registers for driving licence (DL) and registration certificate (RC) of vehicles with the national registers —Sarathi and Vahan -- but the same has not happened yet.Except Telangana, all other states have come on board, officials said. They expect the state to act quickly, as the issue is crucial for dealing with DL and RC related matters at the national level.Umashankar has said that only vehicles registered as “non-commercial car/ jeep/ van” are eligible to get the FASTag-based pass by paying Rs 3,000, granting them 200 toll-free crossings on NHs in a year.Sources said the National Highways Authority of India is giving finishing touches to the scheme and putting all infrastructure in place for starting the registration process. A special team has been trained to handle queries relating to the scheme at their call centre.","The annual pass, to be issued from next week, requires real-time validation of vehicle class through the vahan portal.

"Govt says National Medical Commission rules allow complaints against docs, but commission rejects them",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-says-national-medical-commission-rules-allow-complaints-against-docs-but-commission-rejects-them/articleshow/123076303.cms,"NEW DELHI: Responding to a Parliament question on whether the National Medical Commission (NMC) was biased towards doctors, the health ministry has stated that the ethics regulation of 2002 provided for complaints against doctors. However, NMC’s ethics section has been rejecting all patient appeals claiming that the NMC Act prevails over the 2002 ethics regulation.The NMC act states that doctors can file appeals against state medical council decisions. Referring to this, the ethics section has been dismissing all appeals filed by patients claiming that only doctors can file an appeal, even though it is against the law.The NMC Act itself clearly states that “the rules and regulations made under the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956, shall continue to be in force and operate till new standards or requirements are specified under this Act or the rules and regulations made thereunder”.Since the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 has not been replaced, it still stands. Clause 8.8 of the 2002 ethics regulation states: “Any person aggrieved by the decision of the State Medical Council on any complaint against a delinquent physician, shall have the right to file an appeal to the MCI within a period of 60 days from the date of receipt of the order passed by the said Medical Council”.Yet, over 162 appeals of patients have been rejected by the NMC.In the reply to Parliament, minister of state for health Anupriya Patel stated that “to ensure that the NMC functions in a transparent and fair manner”, the central government appoints the chairperson and presidents of four autonomous boards as per the NMC Act 2019. However, there is no transparency as even the minutes of the meetings of the NMC and its autonomous boards are not available in the public domain as used to be the case with the erstwhile Medical Council of India. Moreover, all autonomous boards including the posts of presidents are currently almost entirely vacant with the government having failed to make appointments for over 10 months.The few minutes of commission’s meetings accessed using RTI show that most non-doctor ex-officio members hardly ever attend meetings and hence most decisions are taken by commission members, almost most of whom are doctors. Of the 33-member commission, about 20 are doctors.“I have complained to the health ministry and the law ministry by registered post about NMC rejecting patient appeals and hence I have proof. So, the health ministry cannot claim to have not received any complaints,” said Gokul Aneja, husband of a victim of alleged medical negligence, who appealed against the decision of the Punjab state medical council, only to have his appeal rejected twice.","The nmc act states that doctors can file appeals against state medical council decisions.

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing logjam in Parliament, PM Narendra Modi will address the BJP-led NDA parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday, a get-together of the alliance's MPs that is being held after a considerable gap, and the first during the current session of Parliament.The NDA meeting also holds significance as filing of nomination papers for the election to the vice-president of India's post begins from Aug 7. The BJP-led bloc will have to announce its candidate - whose election to the post will be a certainty due to the alliance's majority in the electoral college - by Aug 21, the last date of nomination-filing and the monsoon session of Parliament.The electoral college for the vice-president poll includes MPs of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, and its current strength is 782. If the opposition also names a candidate - a distinct possibility - then the poll is scheduled to be held on Sept 9.The meeting comes in the middle of a session which has been a washout so far, except for a two-day discussion on the Pahalgam attack and Operation Sindoor, due to a united opposition's continuous protest against the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar by Election Commission.PM Modi is expected to speak on a host of issues as the opposition has been raising the heat over the poll body's alleged partisan conduct favouring govt, and the terror attack and Operation Sindoor.Sources said Modi may ask alliance MPs to counter the opposition's narrative and also boost the 'Tiranga Yatra' being organised in view of Independence Day.The parliamentary party is also likely to felicitate the PM for the success of Operation Sindoor and neutralisation of the terrorists involved in the attack.Since the 2024 LS elections, when BJP lost its majority but comfortably crossed the halfway mark with allies, the meeting of the party's MPs every session was expanded to include its allies.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday came down heavily on the Punjab Police officers who had allegedly assaulted a serving Army Colonel and his son during an altercation over parking at an eatery when they were travelling from Delhi to Patiala, and reminded them that they were sleeping peacefully because Armymen were protecting the borders in adverse conditions.A bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and Satish Chandra Sharma dismissed the appeal filed against the Punjab and Haryana HC directing an investigation by CBI in the case. The court said that the HC order was well-reasoned and rejected the plea of the police officers.""When war is going on, you glorify these Army officers... Have respect for Army people. You are sleeping peacefully in your house because that man is serving at the border at -40 degrees (Celsius)... We are going to dismiss this with heavy cost. This kind of lawlessness is not acceptable. Let CBI look into this... They go and defend you, and they come back wrapped in a national flag,"" the bench said.HC had ordered a CBI probe into the alleged assault of Army Colonel Pushpinder Singh Bath by Punjab Police personnel in Patiala. It had allowed the plea of Colonel Bath accusing the SIT of ""shielding"" the accused cops. According to the Colonel, who is currently serving as deputy secretary at the cabinet secretariat, he was a hapless victim of extreme brutality and high handedness of Punjab Police.","Hc had ordered a cbi probe into the alleged assault of army colonel pushpinder singh bath by punjab police personnel in patiala.

This recognition marks a significant global endorsement of India's growing digital civic participation and its unique approach to education-led dialogue.The official certificate was conferred at a ceremonial event in the capital by Rishi Nath, adjudicator from Guinness World Records, in the presence of education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, MoS Jitin Prasada, school education secretary Sanjay Kumar, MyGov CEO Nand Kumarum.Since its inception in 2018, the PM under PPC engages with students, parents and educators on topics such as academic stress, digital distractions and time management. The initiative has evolved in alignment with the National Education Policy 2020, aiming to reimagine exams not as a burden but as a celebration of learning.Pradhan called the record a testament to the programme's widespread appeal and its role in fostering an inclusive, holistic educational ethos.""PPC-2025not only achieved 3.53 crore registrations but witnessed over 21 crore viewership across media platforms - highlighting public trust in PM Modi's message of positivity and well-being in education,"" he said.

"Boards ignore SC order, says no to disabled who cleared NEET",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/boards-ignore-sc-order-says-no-to-disabled-who-cleared-neet/articleshow/123104625.cms,"Several candidates with disabilities who cleared the NEET exam in 2025 have been rejected by many of the 16 medical boards across India as being ineligible to do MBBS due to their disability. The candidates complained that the boards seem to be unaware or poorly trained in the new interim guidelines on ""functional assessment"" of persons with disabilities issued on July 19. With no appellate body being constituted by the National Medical Commission (NMC) or the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), as directed by the Supreme Court, the candidates are left with no forum for redress other than courts.According to the National Testing Agency, 753 of the 8,842 candidates with disabilities who sat for the NEET exam have cleared it. The interim guidelines state that legal and policy developments collectively emphasise the prioritisation of ""functional competency over rigid percentage-based disability thresholds"". They talk about facilitating reasonable accommodations, revisiting eligibility norms and adopting evaluation criteria focused on individual capabilities.Yet, according to a wheelchair-using candidate who was rejected, the board asked the person to perform seven physical activities including walking, standing and climbing stairs. Another candidate with missing fingers was rejected by a board in Tamil Nadu but went to Kerala for counselling for the All-India quota and was selected.The NMC has failed to identify at least one assessment centre in each state though the apex court order in Oct last year stated that ""the availability of medical boards should be increased so that there is minimum one medical board in each state and union territory for proper medical examination of students who have passed the examination"". With just 16 centres in 11 states, candidates are forced to spend considerable amounts on travelling, food and lodging.""There appears to be very poor sensitisation in the boards on how to deal with candidates with disabilities. A board in Chennai referred to the candidate as ""patient"" while rejecting her saying that she is ""wheelchair bound"". How will they select when they see her as a patient?"" said Dr Satendra Singh, founder of Doctors With Disabilities: Agents of Change, India's largest network of health professionals with disabilities.This is despite the Supreme Court order stating: ""To enable members of the Disability Assessment Boards to effectively apply the functional competency test, they must be adequately trained by professionals and persons with disabilities or those who have worked on disability justice"". It further mandated that each disability assessment board include at least one doctor with a disability.Although counselling commenced on 21 July 2025, no training schedule for members of the disability assessment boards has been published and no directive has been issued mandating the inclusion of a doctor with a disability on the boards.""The NMC had agreed in court to change the name of the boards from Disability Assessment Boards to Ability Assessment Boards to reflect the change in the focus of the assessments, but that term is nowhere there in the interim guidelines. Candidates with disabilities are paying the price and not everyone can afford to go to court,"" said Dr Singh, who has written to the NMC and the DGHS.He added that the interim guidelines were inadequate, though NMC's expert committee had taken nine months to frame them in time for the 2025-26 academic year.","Candidates with disabilities who cleared the neet exam in 2025 have been rejected by many of the 16 medical boards across india.
