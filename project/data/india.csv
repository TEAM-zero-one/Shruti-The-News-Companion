BHOPAL: Authorities in Madhya Pradesh are investigating allegations that a man hired by a missionary hospital in Damoh district as a 'highly skilled cardiologist' from the UK was a fraud, whose surgeries killed anywhere from seven to a dozen people in less than a month.The suspect, whose real name could be Narendra Vikramaditya Yadav, allegedly posed as UK doctor N John Kem. It is alleged that the hospital hired him although he didn't possess valid medical qualifications or professional credentials.He is accused of performing risky heart surgeries on unsuspecting patients, many of whom died shortly after undergoing the procedures. Local authorities fear that the actual number of victims could be higher.Neither collector Sudhir Kocher nor Damoh chief medical and health officer Dr Mukesh Jain could be contacted for their versions despite multiple attempts. The suspect has gone missing after the complaint.Deepak Tiwari, district president of the Child Welfare Committee, who raised the matter, said that several families alerted the administration after they noticed discrepancies in Yadav's qualifications and credentials. Some patients, who were sceptical of the doctor's expertise, took their relatives to a different hospital in Jabalpur, where it was discovered that Yadav was impersonating a foreign-trained cardiologist.""I came to know that the internal report submitted to the collector has referred to casualties of seven patients who were operated on by the quack, but we think the toll must be around 12,"" Tiwari told TOI.It is also alleged that Yadav has a criminal case against him in Hyderabad and had failed to provide any legitimate identification or medical certificates when questioned.Priyank Kanungo, a member of National Human Rights Commission, posted it on social media and said that the hospital is associated with Prime Minister Ayushman Yojana. In this way, govt money has also been misused, he said.","Authorities in madhya pradesh are investigating allegations that a man hired by a missionary hospital as a 'highly skilled cardiologist' from the uk was a fraud.

Relinquishing it, they say, could weaken his leverage within the party.""There is an undercurrent of one-upmanship between the two stalwarts - Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar - to take control of Congress' state unit. Shivakumar's retention of the KPCC chief's position is seen as a move to balance these power equations,"" said political analyst Vishwas Shetty.The campaign to remove Shivakumar, led by a group of ministers close to Siddaramaiah, including cooperation minister KN Rajanna, was based on the party's ""one man, one post"" principle. But the movement lost momentum following a honeytrap controversy that shook the political establishment. Rajanna's open admission that he was among 48 politicians targeted in the alleged plot forced a temporary pause in the campaign.Unmoved by the internal dissent, Shivakumar has asserted that leadership roles should be earned. ""KPCC positions aren't available in shops, nor can they be obtained by speaking to the media,"" he said in response to his critics.Public works minister Satish Jarkiholi, who has emerged as a key aspirant for the top KPCC role, has publicly pushed for a leadership change. ""There is a written note with the AICC general secretary (organisation) and MP KC Venugopal on the change of the KPCC president after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections,"" Jarkiholi insists, arguing that a dedicated president is crucial to building grassroots support ahead of the 2028 assembly elections.","Dk shivakumar refuses to step down as karnataka pradesh congress committee (kpcc) president.

The Lok Sabha had passed the legislation earlier this week after a 13-hour marathon debate. Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the move as a “watershed moment,” saying that the waqf system had long suffered from a lack of transparency and accountability. “This legislation will boost transparency and safeguard people’s rights,” he posted on X.The Act aims to reform the governance of waqf properties, enhance transparency in dealings, and ensure representation from different Muslim sects in waqf boards. It also includes provisions to safeguard heritage sites, improve social welfare, and support the economic inclusion of marginalized groups, including Muslim widows and divorcees.Minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju, who piloted the Bill, said it would benefit millions of poor Muslims and asserted it does not interfere with waqf properties. “This legislation is based on extensive stakeholder consultation and incorporates recommendations from the Joint Parliamentary Committee,” he said. He clarified that the Central Waqf Council would comprise 22 members, with no more than four non-Muslims, ensuring the body remains secular yet representative.Opposition leaders, however, accused the government of pushing a divisive agenda. Congress MP Dr Syed Naseer Hussain said the Bill was misleading and intended for communal polarisation. DMK’s Tiruchi Siva called it anti-secular and unconstitutional, while TMC’s Mohammad Nadimul Haque said it violates fundamental rights. AAP’s Sanjay Singh urged the government to withdraw the Bill.Union home minister Amit Shah countered that the opposition was misguiding people. BJP’s JP Nadda emphasised that the Bill aligns with UMEED — Unified Waqf Management Empowerment, Efficiency and Development — to modernise property administration.Supporting the Bill, JD(S) chief and former PM HD Devegowda said waqf properties had long been misused by elites. BJP MP Radha Mohan Das said previous governments had neglected the upliftment of poor Muslims, and the Modi government is working to bring them into the mainstream.Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge demanded a withdrawal of the Bill, citing constitutional concerns. AIADMK’s Dr M Thambidurai supported changes in board composition, while Minister Ramdas Athawale claimed the Bill integrates all minority communities.Alongside this legislation, Parliament also approved the Mussalman Wakf (Repeal) Bill, 2025, which repeals the century-old Mussalman Wakf Act of 1923, aiming to eliminate outdated provisions.As the new law comes into force, political debate continues over its long-term impact — whether it will empower marginalised communities or, as critics claim, centralise control and erode minority autonomy.","President droupadi murmu has given her assent to the waqf (amendment) bill, 2025.

We have said what we had to say and made our decision. This file is closed for us now.”His remarks come a day after he sharply criticised the Bill, alleging that it was less about protecting Muslim interests and more about facilitating a business-like acquisition of Waqf land and property by the government. Raut had claimed the move was driven by an interest in Waqf assets worth an estimated Rs 2 lakh crore.While the Shiv Sena (UBT) is stepping back, several other leaders have already taken the matter to the Supreme Court. AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi , Congress leader Mohammad Jawed, and AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan have all filed petitions challenging the Bill.The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, has already been passed by both Houses of Parliament and now awaits President Droupadi Murmu ’s assent.The Lok Sabha cleared the Bill after a 12-hour debate, with 288 MPs voting in favour and 232 against. The Rajya Sabha passed it shortly after midnight, with 128 in favour and 95 opposed.The Bill aims to amend the Waqf Act of 1995 and strengthen the administration and management of Waqf properties across India. It includes provisions to streamline the registration of Waqf properties, reduce the mandatory contribution to Waqf Boards from 7% to 5%, mandate audits for institutions earning above Rs 1 lakh, and introduce a centralised digital system for better oversight.The government has said the legislation is based on recommendations from the Joint Parliamentary Committee and is intended to make Waqf institutions more transparent and efficient.","Shiv sena mp and senior leader sanjay raut said the party will not challenge the waqf amendment bill, 2025, in the supreme court.

NEW DELHI: The Biju Janata Dal (BJD) is grappling with internal unrest following Rajya Sabha MP Sasmit Patra’s support for the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025. Senior party leaders, including former minister Pratap Jena, have urged party president Naveen Patnaik to take disciplinary action, marking the first major intra-party challenge since the BJD's defeat in the 2024 state elections.Jena wrote to Patnaik, demanding accountability for Patra’s stance. The issue intensified after BJD Vice-President Debi Prasad Mishra described the bill as a “debatable issue” and said, “It is up to BJD MPs whether they want to support it or not.”The bill, passed narrowly in both Houses of Parliament, seeks to amend the 1995 Waqf Act to improve property management and digital record-keeping.Congress MP Jairam Ramesh accused the BJD of ""capitulating to BJP pressures at the last minute,"" weakening opposition strength in the Rajya Sabha. ""The 95 number would have been more had not the BJD capitulated,"" Ramesh posted on X.Sasmit Patra confirmed his support for the bill, saying, “The party has decided that the MPs were to vote as per their conscience... I have supported the bill.” BJD sources revealed that four MPs opposed the bill, two supported it, and one abstained.Senior BJD leader and six-time MLA Badri Narayan Patra raised serious concerns, “The party president had explicitly directed members to oppose the Bill… Naveen babu had personally instructed Muzibulla Khan twice — once during a recent Iftar party and again over phone — to vote against the Bill. There is something amiss.”His remarks were echoed by party leaders Shashi Bhusan Behera and Bhupinder Singh, who flagged confusion over BJD’s stance. “All the senior leaders are concerned,” Singh said.A delegation of party leaders, led by deputy leader of opposition Prasanna Acharya, met Naveen Patnaik to express dissatisfaction over the lack of a party whip and the perceived indiscipline. Acharya, while confirming the meeting, said the BJD remains committed to secular values and equidistant from both the NDA and INDIA bloc.Meanwhile, OPCC chief Bhakta Charan Das alleged a tacit deal between the BJD and BJP, hinting that a faction led by Patnaik and aide V K Pandian may merge with the saffron party. BJP’s Babu Singh called the row an “internal discord” while Odisha Law Minister Prithiviraj Harichandan dismissed Congress’s claims.","The biju janata dal (bjd) is grappling with internal unrest following rajya sabha mp sasmit patra’s support for the waqf (amendment) bill, 2025.

The legislation, meant to tighten management of waqf properties, has turned into a flashpoint between NDA and Grand Alliance , triggering a war of words, poster blitz and ideological posturing ahead of the high-stakes electoral battle.At the heart of the row is JDU's support for the bill, which has drawn stinging criticism from the opposition, particularly RJD. Defending its stance, JDU claimed it backed the legislation only after JPC accepted all five of its key recommendations. Party spokesperson Anjum Ara listed these as keeping land under the state list, ensuring the law applies prospectively, preserving the status of religious structures on unregistered waqf land, raising the rank of officers resolving disputes, and extending the digitisation deadline.RJD's attacks have continued, nonetheless. Calling the bill ""unconstitutional"", party functionary Tejashwi Yadav vowed it would be scrapped if Grand Alliance took office. ""This bill won't be implemented at any cost, it will be thrown into the dustbin,"" he said.A poster war has also erupted. RJD kicked it off by likening CM Nitish Kumar to a 'chameleon'. In retaliation, JDU posters accused RJD chief Lalu Prasad of similar flip-flopping, pointing to his 2010 speech in Lok Sabha demanding strict laws for waqf property, which contrasts with RJD's opposition to the bill now.Adding to the fire, governor Arif Mohammed Khan backed the bill, describing it as a necessary reform. ""Which waqf board is actually serving the poor - running orphanages or hospitals?"" he asked, arguing that waqf assets should be used for public good.Union minister Chirag Paswan, too, has joined in, accusing the opposition of stoking fear among Muslims.","The waqf (amendment) bill, cleared by both houses of parliament, has led to a fierce political storm in the state.

: Petitioners in SC

NEW DELHI: After the intense political battles in Parliament over the Waqf Amendment Bill , which was passed after lengthy debates in both Houses, a legal battle is now brewing with multiple petitions filed in Supreme Court . The bill received President Droupadi Murmu's assent late Saturday evening.Also read: President Murmu gives assent to Waqf Bill after Parliament clears it A day after petitions were filed by AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi and Congress MP Mohammad Jawed, two more were filed Saturday - by Aam Aadmi Party MLA Amanatullah Khan and NGO Association for Protection of Civil Rights - alleging that the bill is unconstitutional as it violates several provisions.Both petitions alleged that waqf bill violates fundamental rights enshrined under Articles 14, 15, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30, and 300A of the Constitution. Some opposition parties and political figures are likely to knock Supreme Court's doors against the proposed law on various grounds.They alleged that the sweeping changes brought under Unified Waqf Management, Empowerment, Efficiency and Development Act ""curtailed religious and cultural autonomy of Muslims, enabled arbitrary executive interference, and undermined minority rights to manage their religious and charitable institutions"".The petitions, filed by advocate Adeel Ahmed, questioned introduction of non-Muslim members in waqf boards and Central Waqf Council. ""Principle of equality before the law demands that any classification must be based on intelligible differentia and bear a rational nexus to objective of the law. However, this amendment arbitrarily interferes with religious affairs of Muslim minority, while similar restrictions do not apply to non-Muslim religious institutions, thereby failing the test of fairness, reasonableness, and non-discrimination. Inclusion of non-Muslims in religious affairs of the Muslim minority is not a step toward 'inclusivity' rather, it dilutes the autonomy of an already under-represented community in India's institutional framework,"" his petition said.""In contrast, non-Muslim charitable institutions actively prohibit Muslim participation in their religious affairs, highlighting the discriminatory impact of this amendment,"" it added. The petition filed by the NGO highlighted Sachar Committee Report presents compelling evidence of abysmal socio-economic status and severe under-representation of Muslims in public institutions.Adeel Ahmed's petition also alleged that the transfer of adjudicatory powers from the tribunal to executive authorities like the district collector (Section 4) and curtailment of the tribunal's powers to stay (Section 83) amounted to denial of fair procedure. ""The drastic overhaul proposed by UMEED Bill is not only unnecessary but also an alarming interference into religious affairs of Muslim community diluting the fundamental purpose of waqf,"" it said.""The petitioner humbly submits that UMEED Bill is an unconstitutional and unjustified legislative overreach that must be struck down in the interest of upholding fundamental rights, individual freedom and religious autonomy guaranteed under the Constitution,"" it added.",The waqf amendment bill received president droupadi murmu's assent late saturday evening. Two more petitions have been filed alleging that the bill is unconstitutional as it violates several provisions.

This will be the fourth assessment of the candidate, who has fought against being labelled as ineligible to pursue MBBS by the three earlier boards.The court asked for a fresh assessment, keeping in mind its order in two earlier cases where it emphasised functional assessment rather than an assessment of the extent of disability. The court ruled that denying relief to the petitioner would be ""totally unjustified"" in view of the court ordering admission for MBBS course in two earlier cases where candidates were declared ineligible by the NMC's earlier disability guidelines , which are being revised.The court has ordered for a fresh board of five experts to be constituted, of which ""one member shall be a specialist in locomotor disabilities and one member shall be a neuro-physician"", and asked for the assessment to be done within the next seven days. The assessment report is to be forwarded to the court in a sealed cover before April 15.The counsel for the National Medical Commission submitted that the process for revising the disability guidelines for admission to MBBS course was underway and was expected to be completed before counselling for the 2025-26 academic session. He asked that the matter be deferred till the new guidelines are put in place.""Merely because the NMC is under the process of revising the guidelines, the petitioner's fate cannot be allowed to hang in a limbo in spite of the fact that he has performed exceedingly well in the NEET (UG) 2024 examination and stood high in the merit in his category,"" stated the order.Kabir Paharia had cleared class X with 91.5% and class XII with 90% marks without the help of a scribe to write the exams, and he scored 542 out of 720 in NEET.

"Omar Abdullah govt backs quota review outside, opposes it in court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/omar-abdullah-govt-backs-quota-review-outside-opposes-it-in-court/articleshow/120023736.cms,"SRINAGAR: Omar Abdullah govt has landed in a political hotspot after asking HC to dismiss a petition that calls J&K’s policy of high reservations anti-merit and seeks its rationalisation. The govt’s move is at odds with its long-standing position that the quotas need to be re-examined and its decision to set up a cabinet committee for the review.The govt’s stand in the HC has been spelt out in an affidavit filed on Friday by the social welfare department, whose minister Sakina Itoo heads the cabinet sub-committee. As the govt came under attack from opposition, Itoo suggested Saturday that the affidavit was a mistake and a fresh one would be drawn up.The petition argues that changes brought in reservations laws after abrogation of Article 370 has limited access to open merit candidates to govt jobs and education institutions. Filed last Dec by a lawyer, Zahoor Ahmad Bhat, and some others, the plea contends that the changes reduce open merit seats from 57% to 33%.In its affidavit, the govt said the plea should be dismissed with heavy costs in spite of the fact that it set up the cabinet after massive protests last Dec against the quotas. The affidavit describes the existing reservation policy as constitutional and insists that amendments brought in after abrogation of Article 370 in Aug 2019 has not violated any rights, “whether fundamental, legal or statutory.” It also argues that the govt is entitled to include or exclude any particular section to make “the country socialist in its true spirit”.Omar’s rivals seized on the apparent dichotomy. “The govt is defending a deeply flawed reservation policy in court. The so-called cabinet committee was nothing but a facade to mislead the public,” PDP MLA Waheed Parra said.Peoples Conference legislator Sajad Lone, who had flagged the issue in the assembly last month, noted the silence on the panel. “Nowhere has the govt mentioned the formation of the sub-committee. This is a legal mystery. Seems the govt is not taking its own committee seriously enough to merit a mention in its affidavit,” Lone said.During a debate on March 16 in the assembly, minister Itoo had asserted that the cabinet would examine grievances against the reservation system. Ministers Satish Sharma and Javed Rana as the other members of the panel.As the row escalated, Itoo held a presser Saturday to reaffirm the govt’s commitment to rationalising reservations. She said the govt was “looking at the circumstances” in which the affidavit was filed. The govt will come up with a report on reservations within six months and ensure the recommendations of the panel are implemented, Itoo said. “We are sincere and we are not here to mislead anyone,” the minister added.",Omar abdullah govt asks hc to dismiss a petition that calls j&k’s policy of high reservations anti-merit.
