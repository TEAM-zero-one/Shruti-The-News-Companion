Swearing-in of TN mantris scheduled for 6pm today: Guv office



CHENNAI: The DMK govt in Tamil Nadu got two controversial cabinet members to resign Sunday - electricity and excise minister V Senthil Balaji , whom Supreme Court gave an ultimatum last week to either exit or forfeit bail in a money laundering case, and forest minister K Ponmudy, in the dock for his purportedly disparaging remarks about women and Hindu symbols.Both ministers handed their resignation letters to governor R N Ravi, who accepted these immediately. Raj Bhavan issued a statement soon after, saying CM M K Stalin had recommended to the governor that their resignations be accepted.While Balaji was censured by SC last Wednesday, Ponmudy's remarks about women and symbols raised the hackles of Madras HC, which asked police to file an FIR against him.Housing minister S Muthusamy has been assigned the additional portfolios of excise and prohibition that Balaji used to handle. Muthusamy had been overseeing both when Balaji was sent to prison in 2023.The latter got them back on being reinstated as minister soon after coming out on bail.Transport minister S S Sivasankar has been given additional charge of the electricity department, while dairy development minister R S Rajakannappan will handle the forest portfolio. This is the third change in portfolio for Rajakannappan, as he had been shifted from the transport ministry to backward classes and then to dairy department.Former dairy development minister T Manothangaraj, who was removed from the cabinet last year, was re-inducted into the cabinet without a portfolio. Mano Thangaraj is the other minister to be brought back. Last year, minorities welfare minister S M Nasar returned to the cabinet.

Cop: Man shot as a result of quarrel over food quality



Poll Do you believe the murder of the biryani seller was related to food quality disputes? No, it appears to be a cover story. Yes, it seems plausible.

AGRA: Police have arrested the self-proclaimed 'gau rakshak' (cow vigilante) who allegedly shot dead a biryani seller in Agra's Tajganj area on Wednesday night and later claimed in a video that it was a retribution for the Pahalgam attack .Agra police commissioner Deepak Kumar said in the video, the suspect had identified himself as Manoj Chaudhary , an alleged member of Kshatriya Gau Raksha Dal . He was arrested following multiple raids across Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, sources said on Sunday.On the night of April 23, Gulfam Ali, 27 - who worked at Shahid Ali Chicken Biryani, owned by his cousin - was closing the shop when three men arrived on a scooter. Two of them approached and greeted him before one of them shot him in the chest. His co-worker Saif Ali, 25, suffered minor injuries in the attack. The assailants escaped after the shooting.Hours later, a video circulated online showing Manoj Chaudhary, with pistols tucked in his jeans, alleging he was from Kshatriya Gau Raksha Dal and taking responsibility for the murder. He claimed that he will avenge the killing of 26 - in an apparent reference to the Pahalgam incident - with 2600.Police had earlier dismissed the link of the murder to any operational Kshatriya Gau Raksha Dal unit in Agra, adding that the video was ""likely a publicity stunt"". After the arrest, police commissioner Deepak Kumar reiterated the cops' earlier stance, saying, ""The crime seems to have been committed as a result of a quarrel over the quality of food served by biryani seller a few days ago.""","Manoj chaudhary, an alleged member of kshatriya gau raksha dal, was arrested following multiple raids across madhya pradesh and rajasthan.

LUCKNOW: Barely a few paces from the Uttar Pradesh Assembly in Lucknow, fearless touts at an Aadhaar Seva Kendra (ASK) promise and deliver anything for a price. They even conjure up a name uncannily similar to that of deputy CM Brajesh Pathak .When this reporter visited the Vidhan Sabha Marg-based Ratan square complex to test a widely rumoured tout racket, he was in for many surprises. The crowded Aadhaar Kendra had touts lurking everywhere, among them three young women in their mid-20s who were also part of the syndicate.One such tout, who identified himself as Rajesh, approached this reporter. ""I'm from Bakshi Ka Talab area and a huge admirer of deputy CM Brajesh Pathak. I wish to change my name from Brijesh Pathak to Brajesh Pathak, but there are no documents to support this,"" the reporter dropped the bait. ""Ho jayega (it will be done),"" Rajesh nodded.The tout got down to work. He pulled out his phone, downloaded a real voter ID (EPIC) of another Brajesh Pathak from Badaun, pasted the reporter's photo on it, and added a fake barcode. Within minutes, he booked an instant Aadhaar update appointment - at 12:50 pm - the same day. ""Go straight to the verifier. No questions will be asked,"" Rajesh assured, pocketing Rs 1,500 via UPI.Inside the Aadhaar Seva Kendra, the script unfolded exactly as promised. The verifier at counter-5 barely glanced at the forged documents. At 2 pm, ""Brajesh Pathak"", along with nearly 20 others who sought touts' help, was called - ahead of genuine applicants. The reporter was directed to counter-22, where a young woman operator mechanically processed the update, taking his iris scan. In less than an hour, a fake identity was born. The reporter was embedded in a team of officials who had gone to carry out checks at the ASK after reports swirled about IDs being fabricated.For the last five years, the ASK in question has been operated by Smart Chip Private Limited , the Indian subsidiary of French multinational IDEMIA group.After the successful sting operation, TOI contacted the group's officials for comment on the rigged system at Lucknow centre. But after waiting for a day, an official IDEMIA source said: ""Since we are under contract of UIDAI (govt agency which issues Aadhaar), we cannot comment."" However, the source acknowledged that there were indeed a few staff at Ratan Square ASK allegedly involved in malpractices. But still, Smart Chip Private Limited has no mandate to check documents.A day earlier, the UIDAI regional office of Lucknow, too, had sent at least two decoys to the Ratan Square ASK, and found that touts in connivance with Smart Chip Private Limited staff were involved in malpractices.Speaking to TOI, Prashant Kumar Singh, deputy DG of UIDAI (Lucknow region), acknowledged the matter. ""A recent surprise inspection at ASK Ratan Square revealed irregularities, prompting a decoy operation on April 21 that uncovered the modus operandi. The matter has been escalated to the agency concerned for probe and filing an FIR.

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday posted a series of pointed questions on X, asking a Congress MP whether he had spent 15 continuous days in Pakistan and whether his wife was drawing a salary from an NGO based in the neighbouring country.Without naming anyone, Sarma also raised doubts over the citizenship status of the MP's wife and their children.""Questions for the Hon'ble Member of Parliament from the Congress Party : 1. Did you visit Pakistan for a continuous period of 15 days? If so, could you kindly clarify the purpose of your visit?"" the Assam chief minister wrote on X.Sarma further questioned, ""If so, may we ask why a Pakistan-based organisation is paying a salary for activities conducted in India?"" He alleged that the MP’s wife “continues to receive a salary from a Pakistan-based NGO while residing and working in India.”Responding to the Assam CM, Gogoi hit back, asking if Sarma would resign in case he fails to prove his allegations.""Questions for the Hon’ble Chief Minister of Assam: 1) Will you resign if you fail to prove your allegations of me and my wife being agents of an enemy country? 2) Will you take questions on your own children and wife? 3) Will the state police arrest those linked to coal mafia who make are ravaging the hills of Assam and making crores of undeclared money? Waiting for the SIT report to be submitted,"" Gogoi wrote on X.The exchange of words didn't stop at Gogoi's questions as Sarma responded to the Congress leader, saying ""sufficient material will be placed in the public domain exposing the connections between the concerned Congress Member of Parliament and Pakistan"".""I would like to clarify that neither I nor my son and daughter have ever visited Pakistan. Furthermore, my wife and our entire family would never even think of accepting any salary or financial support from Pakistan. All members of my family, including my wife, son, and daughter, are Indian citizens. None of my children has ever surrendered or renounced Indian citizenship. Now, it is your turn to answer. In the coming days, sufficient material will be placed in the public domain exposing the connections between the concerned Congress Member of Parliament and Pakistan. Wait for 10th September 2025,"" the Assam CM wrote in a reply to Gogoi.Gogoi again repeated his questions in response to the Assam CM's assertions.""None of the questions answered. I will repeat. 1) Will you resign if you fail to prove your allegations of me and my wife being agents of an enemy country? 2) Will you take questions on your own children and wife? 3) Will the state police arrest those linked to coal mafia who make are ravaging the hills of Assam and making crores of undeclared money? Wait for 2026,"" the Congress MP wrote.Amid the slugfest between the leaders, Congress's general secretary KC Venugopal weighed in defence of Gaurav Gogoi , accusing Himanta of ""diverting attention from the scathing corruption allegations"".""The Assam CM’s pathetic, below the belt comments about Gaurav Gogoi prove that he is unfit to be in public life. He is making totally baseless attacks on Gaurav Gogoi’s family, questioning their loyalty and diverting attention from the scathing corruption allegations that he must answer,"" Venugopal wrote on X.Venugopal also drew the spat to the Pahalgam terror attack, saying that in the time of unity, Himanata was ""emboldening our rivals"".""Today, against Pakistan, unity is the need of the hour. By frivolously using the Pakistan bogie against an upright public figure like Gogoi, who has been at the forefront of the attack against the CM, he is only emboldening our rivals as well as confirming that he has no credible response to the mounting evidence of widespread corruption against him. Gaurav Gogoi is an honest leader who is taking on the might of a police state, we steadfastly stand by him,"" the Congress leader said.Retorting to Venugopal, Himanta said his claims were ""factual assertions made after due diligence and careful investigation"".""No Sir. Once again I would like to state with complete responsibility and full sense of authority that every word I have said is based entirely on verifiable facts and 100% authentic information. This is not rhetoric. It is a factual assertion made after due diligence and careful investigation,"" he added.Both Gogoi and the BJP have repeatedly targeted Gaurav Gogoi, the deputy leader of the Congress in Lok Sabha, over his wife's alleged connections with Pakistan.In addition, Sarma sought clarification on the citizenship of the MP’s wife and two children, asking, ""Are they Indian citizens, or do they hold the citizenship of any other country? Many more questions will follow,"" he warned.Last month, Sarma had stated that the state government might approach international agencies such as Interpol to probe the alleged involvement of Pakistani national Ali Tauqeer Sheikh, who is said to have links with Gogoi’s British wife, Elizabeth Colburn , in India's internal matters.Responding to the allegations earlier, Gogoi had charged the BJP with peddling ""baseless allegations"" as the party ""has no issue to raise.""",Assam chief minister himanta biswa sarma posted a series of pointed questions on x.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu ministers Senthil Balaji and K Ponmudy quit the chief minister MK Stalin-led Cabinet on Sunday, reported news agency PTI, citing Raj Bhavan. Governor RN Ravi has accepted the resignation of both the leaders.SS Sivasankar has been additionally assigned the Electricity portfolio. S Muthusamy will also handle Prohibition and Excise. RS Rajakannappan will now oversee Forests and Khadi and has been appointed as the minister for forests and khadi.Additionally, the CM Stalin has recommended the induction of T Mano Thangaraj, MLA from Padmanabhapuram assembly Constituency, into the Cabinet.The swearing-in ceremony for the new minister designate is scheduled for Monday, April 28 at Raj Bhavan, Chennai.The resignation of the two ministers comes as both the DMK leaders face legal challenges, with the Supreme Court on Thursday agreeing to hear a plea in the cash-for-jobs scam , in which Senthil Balaji is one of the main accused.The plea has challenged the clubbing of four separate chargesheets - pertaining to corrupt practices in the appointments of assistant engineers, junior tradesmen, conductors and drivers - with an existing case related to the appointment of junior engineers.On Wednesday, the Madras high court noted that the remarks made by K Ponmudy against Shaivism, Vaishnavism, and women were prima facie hate speech and decided to initiate suo motu proceedings against him in that regard.""Prima facie, it was evident that his remarks demean the moral worth of sex workers, particularly women, and were calculated to subvert harmony and peace among religious groups and various sects,"" the judge said.The comments, on the face of it, were completely derogatory towards women and deliberately spewed venom and hatred on the two main sects of Hinduism, the judge added. The judge directed the initiation of proceedings as the Tamil Nadu police failed to register an FIR against the minister, as suggested by the high court last week.According to the court, as per the Supreme Court order, police are mandated to register a case against such hate speech even in the absence of a formal complaint.",Senthil balaji and k ponmudy quit the chief minister mk stalin-led cabinet.

The revisions, aligning with NEP 2020, aim to incorporate Indian traditions and philosophies, featuring Indian writers and themes in English textbooks while also highlighting government initiatives and constitutional rights.

Revisions aim at including Indian traditions into school curriculum



Poll Do you agree with the removal of Mughals and the Delhi Sultanate references from the NCERT textbook? No, it should be included. Yes, it's a necessary change.

NEW DELHI: All references to Mughals and the Delhi Sultanate have been removed from Class VII NCERT social science textbook. NCERT officials indicated that the released book - ' Exploring Society: India and Beyond ' - only represents the first part of the revised syllabus, with the second part expected in the coming months. However, they refrained from commenting on whether the omitted content would be part of the yet-to-be-released second part.In the English textbook 'Poorvi', out of 15 stories, poems and narratives, 9 are by Indian writers or feature Indian themes, with contributions from figures like Rabindranath Tagore, APJ Abdul Kalam and Ruskin Bond.This marks a shift from the previous textbook 'Honeycomb', which had only four Indian writers among its 17 authors.The new books, which were released this week, introduce a variety of changes, including addition of chapters on Indian dynasties, ""sacred geography"", govt initiatives and other cultural aspects, aligning with the vision outlined in the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCFSE) 2023.These revisions aim at incorporating Indian traditions, philosophies and local knowledge systems into the school curriculum.The move follows earlier efforts during the Covid-19 pandemic to streamline the syllabus, where sections on Mughals and the Delhi Sultanate, including detailed accounts of dynasties like those of Tughlaq, Khalji, Mamluk, and Lodi, were trimmed. In the most recent update, all references to these historical periods have been completely removed from the social science textbook.Instead, the revised social science textbook 'Exploring Society: India and Beyond' introduces fresh chapters on ancient Indian dynasties such as the Magadha, Maurya, Shunga, and Satavahanas, with a strong emphasis on ""Indian ethos"". One notable addition is a chapter titled 'How the Land Becomes Sacred', which explores the significance of sacred places across India and the world, touching on major pilgrimage sites associated with various religions, including Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism and Sikhism.The chapter delves into concepts like ""sacred geography"", describing networks of revered locations such as the 12 jyotirlingas, the Char Dham Yatra, and the shakti pithas, as well as sacred mountains, rivers, and forests. A quote from Jawaharlal Nehru about India being a land of pilgrimages further underscores this theme.The revised curriculum also discusses the 'varna-jati' system, noting its role in providing societal stability initially, but highlighting how it became rigid over time, particularly under British colonial rule, leading to inequalities.In addition, the Maha Kumbh Mela, which attracted around 660 million people in Prayagraj this year, is mentioned, though the tragic stampede that resulted in the loss of 30 lives is not referenced. The book also introduces content related to modern-day India, including references to govt initiatives like 'Make in India', 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' and the Atal Tunnel.A chapter on the Constitution emphasises the importance of national flag, recounting a landmark moment in 2004 when a citizen challenged the restriction on flying the national flag at home. SC's ruling affirmed that flying the tricolour is part of Fundamental Right to Freedom of Expression.","All references to mughals and the delhi sultanate have been removed from class vii ncert social science textbook.

Poll Do you think the child's initial silence about the abuse is common in such cases? No, it should be reported immediately Yes, it's a common reaction

CHENNAI: A child's trauma at being sexually abused by her father, a mother's initial attempt to protect her without reporting the crime, a phone call from an aunt in Singapore that led to the ghastly secret inadvertently tumbling out, and a long, bumpy road to justice.Seven years of silence, fear, doubt, blackmail and legal complexities culminated recently in a Pocso trial court verdict that sent the convicted offender - a Chennai builder - to 20 years in jail. The abuse had started in April 2018, with the father targeting his then five-year-old daughter on the pretext of bathing her. When the child complained to her mother about what she was being subjected to, it led to regular fights between husband and wife.The child, already traumatised, further withdrew into her shell when she saw her parents quarrel. The abuse continued, but she would no longer complain lest the domestic situation worsen. The mother purportedly saw in her daughter's eyes what she couldn't express, so she sent the child to a relative's house in Thiruvarur district, 300km from Chennai.The crime might have been buried forever had the survivor's maternal aunt not called the relative's house one day and asked to speak to her niece.During the conversation, the child confided in her aunt that she was ""finally happy"" as she no longer faced ""torture"". Some prodding led to the survivor narrating her ordeal and naming her father as the culprit.The aunt flew down to Tamil Nadu within days and took her niece to a hospital, where medical tests confirmed injuries indicating sexual abuse .Based on the medical findings, a Pocso case was filed, and the father was arrested. In 2023, the girl's mother moved Madras high court and secured custody of her daughter. This coincided with the trial court denying bail to the father, citing his daughter's testimony.Over the next year, the mother allegedly tutored the child to retract her statements about being abused by her father. Although the court allowed the girl weekly visits to her aunt, her mother retained custody.At a hearing last week, the survivor told the court that no abuse of the kind she had previously detailed ever happened and that she wished for her family to live together. Despite the child denying she was abused, Pocso court judge M Rajalakshmi relied on her original statement - backed by her medical report - to deliver the verdict the girl's determined aunt and the prosecution were waiting to hear. The convict was also fined Rs 1 lakh.","Seven years of silence, fear, doubt, blackmail and legal complexities culminated in a pocso trial court verdict that sent the convicted offender to 20 years in jail.

He won the election with 133 votes out of 142, while Congress candidate Mandeep Singh got eight votes. One vote was declared invalid.Singh, a second-term councillor from Mukherjee Nagar ward, stated that his party would actively pursue improvements in sanitation services, withdraw user charges, find permanent solutions for waterlogging, and address long-pending infrastructure projects.The assembly commenced with two minutes of silence, followed by passing a condolence resolution honouring those who lost their lives in the Pahalgam terror incident that claimed 26 victims. In response to the tragic event, authorities removed all celebratory decorations from the mayoral election venue.The BJP's control over municipal, state, and central govts, which they term as a 'triple engine' govt, marks a significant shift in MCD's administration. The party has assured that this unified governance structure will expedite development initiatives.The incoming Mayor will however face immediate challenges, including preparations to tackle monsoon-related waterlogging issues and addressing the city's ongoing sanitation problems.While AAP abstained from attending the house meeting, Congress candidates contested the elections for the Mayor and Deputy Mayor posts, even though it has eight councillors among the 274 of the electoral college.The DPCC President Dender Yadav on 'X' stated, ""After AAP ran away from its responsibility, Congress is keeping the tradition of loyalty and dedication towards the public by nominating candidates.""

No, it should focus solely on financial crimes. Yes, it's necessary to ensure quality education.

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate has added a new dimension to its actions — its recent searches on FIITJEE were prompted not just by financial irregularities, but also by the institute’s failure to deliver “quality educational services” promised to students.The anti-money laundering agency has always been confined to probing financial frauds, tracking money trail of proceeds of crime and attachment of assets. But, of late, it has shifted its focus to immediate restitution of attached assets: be it to banks or individuals who have been scammed by fraudsters.As an outcome of its searches earlier this week, ED on Saturday said the probe revealed FIITJEE collected Rs 250 crore from 15,000 students and siphoned off the proceeds in buying personal properties by di rectors and other top executives of the coaching company.At least 32 coaching centres at Ghaziabad, Lucknow, Meerut, Noida, Prayagraj, Delhi, Bhopal, Gwalior, Indore Faridabad, Gurugram, Mumbai etc were abruptly shut down, causing widespread distress leading to several FIRs registered by police in several states.“These funds were diverted for personal and unauthorized use, while faculty salaries remained unpaid,” ED said. On April 24, ED conducted searches at seven locations in Noida, Delhi and Gurgaon in the case of FIITJEE fraud.The ED said it initiated investigation against FIIT-JEE and its senior management as FIRs alleged that the “senior management collected substantial fees from students and parents under the pretext of providing quality educational services , but instead engaged in large-scale financial fraud and criminal breach of trust.”","Anti-money laundering agency has always been confined to probing financial frauds.

India’s sudden Jhelum water release sparks panic in PoK,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/indias-sudden-jhelum-water-release-sparks-panic-in-pok/articleshow/120652831.cms,"Poll Do you think the lack of prior notification before water release is a violation of the Indus Waters Treaty? No, it's not a violation. Yes, it is a clear violation.

Water came rushing in, we're struggling to protect lives and property: POK resident



ISLAMABAD: A sudden surge in the Jhelum river’s water level has thrown Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) into chaos, as India, local authorities claimed, released water from the Uri Dam without prior warning on Saturday.The abrupt discharge triggered a water emergency in PoK’s Hattian Bala district, forcing residents along the riverbanks to flee to safer ground.The move escalated tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, with Pakistani authorities condemning it as a violation of international norms and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). India suspended the IWT on April 23 citing the terror attack in Pahalgam in which 26 people were killed by terrorists.Local officials in Muzaffarabad, PoK’s capital, and Chakoti sounded alarms through loudspeakers, urging communities to evacuate as water levels rose rapidly. “We had no warning. The water came rushing in, and we’re struggling to protect lives and property,” said Muhammad Asif, a resident of Dumel, a village on the riverbank in PoK.A district government official in Muzaffarabad issued a brief statement advising citizens to stay away from locations close to the Jhelum river. “Due to India releasing more water than usual into the Jhelum river, there is moderate flooding,” added the spokesperson.Moderate flooding has been reported in low-lying regions of Kohala and Dhalkot, with unconfirmed reports of livestock losses and damage to crops.The PoK govt has accused India of deliberate “water terrorism”, pointing to the lack of prior notification as a breach of the IWT, a 1960 agreement brokered by the World Bank to regulate shared river waters. The treaty mandates that both nations share information on water releases to prevent downstream harm.In PoK, officials said, the immediate focus remains on protecting residents. The Hattian Bala administration has set up temporary shelters and mobilised rescue teams. “We’re doing all we can, but the scale of this crisis is overwhelming,” said district commissioner Bilal Ahmed.Authorities have also urged residents to avoid riverbanks and refrain from fishing or grazing livestock near the water. Across the border, India officials have remained tight-lipped, neither confirming nor denying the release. Some Indian media outlets, however, claim the discharge was a routine dam operation necessitated by heavy rainfall in Jammu and Kashmir.","Sudden surge in the jhelum river’s water level has thrown pakistan-occupied kashmir into chaos.
