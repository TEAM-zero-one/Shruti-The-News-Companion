NEW DELHI: BJP Monday said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has been continuously lowering the dignity of the position of the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha that he holds as his remarks like ""atom bomb"" and ""hydrogen bomb"" in context of voters and elections are unfortunate and disturbing.At a press conference, BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad, ""Rahul Gandhi's yatra has ended today in Patna. He is talking about the 'hydrogen bomb'. The 'atom bomb' claim he made on the Karnataka polls was defused. What's the relation of the hydrogen bomb to polls? Why is he demeaning himself? He is the LoP of Lok Sabha."" Prasad accused the Congress neta of disrespecting voters and undermining democracy with his controversial remarks during the 'Vote Adhikar Yatra'.""So far, a hydrogen bomb has never been detonated anywhere in the world, and yet Rahul Gandhi keeps talking about it... It wasn't even equal to a small Diwali firecracker,"" Prasad quipped.He accused Gandhi of tarnishing the dignity of his position as theleader of opposition saying, ""The nation knows very well whether he has reached there by his own talent and capability - or merely because of his family background.""Prasad further slammed Gandhi for insulting PM Narendra Modi and his mother during his yatra.tnn",Congress leader rahul gandhi has been continuously lowering the dignity of the position of the leader of opposition in lok sabha.

BJP filed 16 objections seeking exclusion and CPI (ML) Liberation, 103. RJD and CPI(ML) Liberation have applied for inclusion of 15 and 10 electors, respectively.Electors have directly filed 36,474 claims for inclusion and almost 2.2 lakh for exclusion. The exclusions have been sought mainly by electors who submitted enumeration forms while already enrolled at other places. Section 31 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, provides for up to a year's jail term for falsely claiming no prior enrolment as an elector.Over 16.5 lakh new electors have applied for enrolment upon turning 18 years of age or on account of seeking it for the first time despite being eligible.Of these, 45 forms were received through party BLAs.With the claims and objections period over, the ball is now in the court of 243 electoral registration officers (EROs) and 2,976 assistant EROs. They will scrutinise the enumeration forms and the documents attached, in light of the booth level officers' recommendations. Sources said almost 70% of the electors may not require scrutiny as nearly 4.96 crore electors (though these may include the 65 lakh names deleted on account of being dead, permanently shifted, untraceable or enrolled at multiple places) were there in the 2003 roll and not required to submit any documents.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday did not extend the Sept 1 deadline for filing claims and objections to Bihar Draft Voters List prepared after special intensive revision (SIR) as the Election Commission said such submissions can be made by people till the last date of nominations for the Assembly elections.""Most importantly, the filing of claims or objections or corrections is not barred after Sept 1. These can be submitted even after the deadline. The applications submitted for claims, objections or corrections after Sept 1 will be considered after the electoral roll has been finalised,"" Election Commission told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi, while arguing that extension of deadline would create complications.For EC, senior advocates Rakesh Dwivedi and Maninder Singh said, ""The process of consideration of claims and objections continues until the last date of filing of nominations, and all inclusions and exclusions are integrated in the final roll.""After the recording of EC's statement, the bench expressed surprise that despite several SC directives to political parties which protested SIR, only 128 claims and objections were filed: 10 by RJD for inclusion, and 118 by CPI(ML) Liberation (103 challenging inclusion and rest for inclusion).""What is bothering us is that despite all these directions passed by the Supreme Court, the political parties have come out with only 128 claims and objections. The booth level agents (BLAs) are grassroots-level party workers. Why are BLAs not coming out with lists of people allegedly excluded from the draft voter list? And what is more surprising is that political parties are filing more applications for deletion rather than inclusion,"" the bench said.Finding that the political parties are not assisting those among the 65-lakh people deleted from the voter list to file claims, the bench directed the state legal services authority to instruct by Tuesday noon its district units to activate para-legal volunteers and assist people in getting enrolled.EC, as per its records, said, ""Approximately 99.5% of the electors (out of 7.24 crore) featured in the draft electoral roll for the state of Bihar have already submitted their eligibility documents pertaining to the SIR exercise.""Importantly, the bench asked the district legal services authorities (DLSAs) to send a confidential report on the issues faced by people in inclusion, correction or deletion of their names from the voter list. It posted the matter for further hearing on Sept 8.EC told the apex court that, in contrast with political parties, individual electors have been more alert and proactive, having submitted 33,326 forms for inclusion in the draft roll and 2,07,565 forms for deletion.EC said extension of the deadline would disrupt the schedule for finalisation of electoral roll.

BJP Raises Objection Over Alleged Abuses At Congress Rally Against PM Modi's Mother





What's next?



NEW DELHI: For 16 days, Rahul Gandhi’s 'Voter Adhikar Yatra' carved a noisy trail through Bihar ’s dusty highways and crowded colonies. More than a campaign, it was pitched as a ""moral"" crusade: a fight to ""protect the vote"" of millions allegedly struck off the rolls. The march had political theatrics, constitutional sermons, and opposition show of force - adding to both hope and controversy.Over 1,300 km, across 25 of 38 districts and 110 assembly constituencies, Rahul Gandhi walked, rode bikes, and waved his way through Bihar's politically charged landscape. From Sasaram to Patna, the yatra drew vast crowds, with slogans like 'Vote Chor, Gaddi Chhor' echoing throughout.INDIA bloc allies joined at different stages, turning the yatra into a a portrait of opposition unity.At its core, the campaign was about a single phrase 'vote theft.' Rahul Gandhi accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Election Commission of disenfranchising more than 65 lakh voters, disproportionately Dalits, OBCs, Muslims, and the poor, through the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls.""This is not just about Bihar, it is about India's democracy,"" he declared at multiple stops, equating the march with a defence of the Constitution itself.While Congress has long been a marginal force in Bihar, this yatra has pushed Rahul Gandhi into the role of lead protagonist in the opposition drama, rather than a supporting character.Though Congress has long been a minor player in Bihar politics, the yatra has also revived its cadre, giving local workers visibility and provided the party a chance to reset its organisational machinery months before Bihar assembly elections By framing the battle as one of rights and democracy, rather than caste politics alone, Congress seeks to leapfrog back into Bihar's political relevance. The yatra has also sharpened opposition attacks on the EC, ensuring the issue will reverberate in coming elections.The finale in Patna on Monday tied the campaign's rhetoric to history. Marching from Gandhi Maidan to Ambedkar’s statue, Rahul Gandhi invoked both leaders’ legacies, casting the yatra as a ""revolution for electoral justice.""Visuals of him in white T-shirt and local gamcha, riding jeeps and chatting with villagers, were circulated widely on social media by the party - crafted as proof of a grounded, accessible leader. Congress leader also stepped into knee-deep waters to see how makhana (fox nuts) - world's new favourite superfood from Bihar - is grown. Sharing a video of his interaction, Rahul said the entire hard work is done by 99 per cent 'Bahujans' while the benefit goes to only 1 per cent middlemen, as he vowed to fight this ""injustice"".But the road was not without bumps. A police constable injured in Rahul Gandhi’s convoy became a flashpoint for BJP attacks. Meanwhile, alleged abusive remarks against PM Modi during a rally in Darbhanga drew sharp and coordinated criticism from the BJP.Both party workers also clashes in Patna over the remarks escalating political tensions.The yatra has undeniably energised Congress’s rank and file, repositioned Rahul Gandhi as a rights-focused challenger to PM Modi, and sent a message of opposition unity in a state where caste politics usually dominates. But the unanswered question remains: will this momentum last, or will it fade like previous Congress spurts?For now, Rahul Gandhi leaves Bihar having turned ""vote theft"" into a political battle cry and hoping his yatra is remembered less as a roadshow, and more as the beginning of a movement that translates into results in upcoming elections.","25 districts, 110 seats, 1300 km.

NEW DELHI: At an age when many women are busy caring for their grandchildren, a 55-year-old from Rajasthan’s Udaipur district has just welcomed her 17th child.The birth at the Community Health Centre in Jhadol block has turned Lilavas village into a talking point. Relatives, neighbours and villagers crowded the hospital to see Rekha, amused at the unusual sight of grandchildren greeting their new baby aunt, PTI reported.Rekha, married to scrap dealer Kavara Ram Kalbelia, has given birth 17 times over the years. Five of those children – four sons and one daughter – died soon after birth, leaving the couple with 12 surviving kids: seven boys and five girls.Their household spans three generations under one roof. ""Two of my sons and three of my daughters are married. Each of them has two or three children,"" Kavara said, his voice carrying both pride and weariness.This means while Rekha tends to her newborn, she is simultaneously grandmother to several toddlers.Behind the curiosity, however, lies hardship. Kavara makes a meagre living by selling scrap and admits to taking high-interest loans to pay for his children’s weddings. “No member of the family has ever gone to school,” he said, highlighting how poverty continues to dominate their lives.Doctors at the Jhadol centre described the delivery as a challenge. Rekha initially told them it was only her fourth pregnancy. Block CMHO Dr Dharmendra noted that the case reflects the difficulties in tribal-dominated areas, where lack of education and awareness often fuel such situations.“This is a nomadic family that keeps moving. Eleven surviving children were found with them. We will work to link them with government schemes and provide support,” he said.Gynaecologist Dr. Roshan Darangi, who handled the delivery, confirmed the truth later: “It turned out to be her 17th childbirth. Now, we will counsel her for sterilisation.”Another doctor, Mukesh Garasiya, added that Rekha had been admitted on August 24 without sonography or pre-delivery tests. “She could have died from excessive bleeding. With so many deliveries, the uterus weakens and the risk of haemorrhage rises. Thankfully, this time, everything went smoothly,” he explained.","Rekha ram kalbelia, 55, from rajasthan's udaipur district has just welcomed her 17th child.

NEW DELHI: Expressing serious doubts about its own 2014 verdict delivered by a five-judge constitution bench, which held that provisions of Right to Education (RTE) Act were not applicable to religious and linguistic minority educational institutions, Supreme Court has said the ruling ""strikes at the heart of good quality universal elementary education, its consequences are far-reaching"", and hence it needs to be re-examined.While deciding a batch of pleas from Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra on whether passing the Teacher Eligibility Test was mandatory for appointment in minority-run schools, a two-judge bench referred the case to CJI to consider the desirability of forwarding the matter to a larger bench. It said putting minority institutions outside the Act's ambit would weaken the idea of inclusivity.Minority schools aren't bound by the law that sets rules for appointment of teachers and the provision of free education for poor students.The SC bench said its own 2014 judgment essentially created a dichotomy between RTE under Article 21A and the collective rights under Article 30(1), which is about the right of minority communities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.""We respectfully express our doubt as to whether Pramati Educational and Cultural Trust (case) (insofar as it exempts the application of the RTE Act to minority schools, whether aided or unaided, falling under clause (1) of Article 30 of the Constitution) has been correctly decided...Thus,ultimately, a reconsideration (of the judgment) seems unavoidable,"" Justice Dipankar Datta, who penned the verdict for the bench, also comprising Justice Manmohan, said.The bench said, ""We hasten to observe with utmost humility at our command that the decision in Pramati Educational and Cultural Trust (case) might have, unknowingly, jeopardised the very foundation of universal elementary education. Exemption of minority institutions from the RTE Act leads to fragmentation of the common schooling vision and weakening of the idea of inclusivity and universality envisioned by Article 21A. """"We are afraid, instead of uniting children across caste, class, creed, and community, it reinforces 'divides' and 'dilutes' the transformative potential of shared learning spaces. If the goal is to build an equal and cohesive society, such exemptions move us in the opposite direction,"" it said.The bench framed four issues to be adjudicated by a larger bench and it included whether the 2014 verdict, exempting minority educational institutions from the purview of the RTE Act, requires reconsideration.The bench noted that exemption of minority schools from the Act was being misused.","Rte exemption may undermine vision of universal edu: sc bench.

SC validates 85% MBBS quota for locals in Telangana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-validates-85-mbbs-quota-for-locals-in-telangana/articleshow/123643876.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday said since states have given up 15% of MBBS seats to the all India quota (AIQ), they can validly reserve rest of the seats in govt medical colleges for natives, and upheld Telangana’s medical admission norm mandating a candidate to study classes 9-12 within the state.During hearing of petitions, which questioned the validity of such a rule, a bench comprsing Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran had repeatedly asked the state govt that would it be unfair to students whose parents are natives of Telangana but for better coaching facilities sent their wards to cities outside the state.The bench had even suggested that the state could have made the 2024 domicile rule applicable from 2028 to allow students to study for four consecutive years in the state prior to taking the NEET-UG examination for admissions to medical colleges. However, in its judgment the bench upheld Telangana’s domicile rule while recording the state’s concessions — children of state govt employees and all India service Telangana cadre officers who studied outside because of posting of their parents outside the state would be eligible for admissions.Writing the judgment recording the relaxations for children of state and all India services employees posted outside Telangana, Justice Chandran said, “We uphold the Rules of 2017 as it stood amended in 2024.”This means that children of natives of Telangana, working in private companies and posted outside the state, would not be eligible to admissions in the 85% of MBBS seats in govt medical colleges of the state.Faulting the HC order scaling down the ‘domicile’ eligibility conditions for admission, SC cited its 2018 judgment upholding a similar domicile eligibility criterion devised by Assam.The court had said there was no data on record to state that adequate coaching facilities for medical entrance examination was unavailable in the state. It had said that those who can afford coaching outside the state fall in the affluent class of citizens and could compete for the 15% all India quota MBBS seats reserved in every state-run medical college.",Supreme court said states can validly reserve rest of seats in govt medical colleges for natives.

NEW DELHI: Former vice-president Jagdeep Dhankhar on Monday vacated VP Enclave, almost six weeks after his unexpected resignation from the second highest constitutional post. Dhankhar has shifted to a farmhouse at Gadaipur in south Delhi's Chhatarpur, which belongs to INLD chief Abhay Chautala , in what is supposed to be an encampment before he gets an official bungalow.Videos showed Dhankhar, the first occupant of the Enclave, leaving the sprawling complex in the evening, accompanied by a cavalcade of cars, police escort vehicles, and an ambulance.Chautala said on X that he had offered his place to the ex-VP because of their old family links. ""We have old family ties with him. He is like a family member. When I asked him where he was shifting, he said he was thinking about it. I told him it (my farmhouse) is his house. Till the new official accommodation is allotted and ready, he can stay in our house,"" the INLD chief said.A few days ago, INLD leader Abhay Chautala had told mediapersons in Haryana that he was confident of Jagdeep Dhankhar soon speaking about why he resigned from the VP post while asserting that he had spoken to the former VP.Sources said the VP Enclave will be made ready for Dhankhar's successor in the next 10 days. The VP election will be held on Sept 9 and NDA's candidate C P Radhakrishnan is the favourite. TOI has learnt that so far there has been no movement to identify any retirement home for Dhankhar, with sources saying that the housing & urban affairs ministry would begin shortlisting available type-VIII bungalows in the Lutyens' Bungalow Zone after getting a communication from MHA. ""That process will take some time as after identifying bungalows, there will be some renovation and other works,"" said a source.Meanwhile, govt functionaries whom Dhankhar had selected to be attached to him have raised eyebrows in govt quarters by putting in requests for residential accommodation in Delhi. Sources said that usually such requests are routed through the proper channel.Dhankhar shared close ties with former deputy PM Devi Lal and his son, the ex-chief minister of Haryana Om Prakash Chautala. Though the former VP crossed over to Congress and, later, joined BJP, he had attended O P Chautala's last rites in Khera village of Sirsa district.Dhankhar got the Central Public Works Department to add many features, including a swimming pool, to the VP Enclave.

NEW DELHI: The 15finance commission envisaged 17,000 anganwadis cum creches (AWCCs) by 2025-26. Only 2,448 AWCCs (less than 15%) have been made operational till the end of July with over 52,000 beneficiaries.According to government data, nearly 9 crore children (0-6 years) were enrolled in anganwadis. Barely 0.06% of them have access to creche facilities. The projected population of children up to six years, the target population for creches, was roughly 16 crore in 2021.From 7,930 creches in June 2019, the number of creches has steadily fallen. Opening more creches was meant to boost women’s workforce participation, but answers to queries in Parliament show that the number of functional creches has been reducing. Uttar Pradesh, with high fertility and high child population, had no creches in 2019 and continues to have none. In fact, none have been approved. Many such states with high child population such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, West Bengal and Odisha, which used to have several hundred creches, have become zero-creche states.By the end of July, the ministry of women and child development had approved 14,599 anganwadi cum creches (AWCCs) based on the proposals received from states and union territories.However, only a fraction of these have become operational, according to data presented in Parliament. For instance, 1,024 AWCCs have been approved for Jharkhand and 1,000 for Odisha, but none are operational in either state. In Telangana, 1,033 have been approved and only eight are functional with 63 beneficiaries. Rajasthan has no approved or functional AWCCs.Some states have standalone creches run by NGOs and aided by the central government. However, the number of such creches has been falling steadily. From 2,412 across India in 2023, these have come down to just 1,284. According to Niti Aayog, a majority of states have stated that they prefer to run anganwadi cum creches (AWCCs) instead of separate stand-alone crèches as it increases their financial, HR and administrative burden.Following allegations of irregularities in the management of creches and misappropriation of funds, the Rajiv Gandhi National Creche Scheme launched in January 2006 was discontinued by December 31, 2016. Before the scheme was discontinued, it was funding almost 25,000 creches with about 6 lakh beneficiaries, according to data presented to Parliament data in March 2017.From January 1, 2017, the ministry funded creche services through the National Creche Scheme, wherein stand-alone creches were operated as a centrally funded scheme with the Centre bearing 90% of the cost and the remaining 10% borne by voluntary organisations running the creches.However, since state or UT governments were not stakeholders in the scheme, it was felt that monitoring and supervision was inadequate. Hence, the women and child development ministry introduced the Palna scheme on April 1, 2022 “to provide quality crèche facility in safe and secure environment for children (from ages 6 months – 6 years), nutritional support, health and cognitive development of children, growth monitoring & immunization. Crèchefacilities under Palna are provided to all mothers, irrespective of their employment status”. Crèches are supposed to be open for 26 days in a month and for seven and half hours per day as per the work schedule of majority of mothers in the area.The funding ratio under Palna is 60:40 between union and state governments and UTs with legislature, except the North East and special category states, where the ratio is 90:10. For UTs without legislature, 100% funding is provided by the Centre. This funding pattern is probably why states and UTs with 90-100% central funding account for more than a third of operational creches.With the change in funding pattern, by 2019, the number of functional creches crashed to less than 8,000 and kept declining till it reached an all-time low of 2,163 creches (1,428 stand-alone creches and 735 AWCCs) in June 2024. Though this number had gone up to 2,448 creches by July-end this year, seven large states had zero functional creches while two, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana, had three and eight each.","The 15finance commission envisaged 17,000 anganwadis cum creches by 2025-26.

Congress MP Tagore writes to PM seeking review of clearances for Great Nicobar Project,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-mp-tagore-writes-to-pm-seeking-review-of-clearances-for-great-nicobar-project/articleshow/123639385.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid continuing uproar over the Great Nicobar Project, Congress MP Manickam Tagore on Monday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking his urgent intervention to protect the constitutional and legal rights of the Nicobarese tribes that are “threatened” by the Rs 72,000-crore infrastructure scheme. He urged the PM to direct the Union ministries of tribal affairs, and environment and forests, to conduct an independent review of the process followed to grant forest clearances and divert forest land in Nicobar.In his letter, Tagore said the Andaman and Nicobar administration has wrongly claimed that Forest Rights Act (FRA) rights were “identified and settled” before forest clearances were granted for diversion of 13,075 hectares of forest land. He said the Tribal Council of Great Nicobar has categorically rejected the administration’s claim and dubbed the assertion a direct violation of FRA, 2006.The Congress MP urged Modi to suspend the project till laws are complied with, and to ensure that forest rights of the tribal communities are fully recognised before land diversion. He also demanded that officials be held accountable for “misrepresentation”.Arguing that the Nicobarese community is among India’s most vulnerable groups and has been historically protected under the Protection of Aboriginal Tribes Regulation, 1956, Tagore said, “The strength of our democracy lies in protecting the rights of the weakest. The voice of the Nicobarese must be heard, respected, and upheld in the true spirit of justice”.","Congress mp manickam tagore wrote to prime minister narendra modi seeking his urgent intervention.
