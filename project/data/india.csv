SC to decide validity of Madras HC stay on Tamil Nadu law on University VC appointments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-to-decide-validity-of-madras-hc-stay-on-tamil-nadu-law-on-university-vc-appointments/articleshow/122260745.cms,"Photo/Agencies

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday entertained Tamil Nadu’s petition questioning reasonableness of Madras HC’s order staying its legislation, which gave the state government, instead of the governor, the power to appoint University vice-chancellors, but refused M K Stalin government’s plea for suspending the HC order to re-operationalize the law.TN fielded a team of senior advocates – A M Singhvi, Rakesh Dwivedi and P Wilson – to argue that the HC had without considering the urgency to appoint vice-chancellors to universities, recommendations to which effect has been put in cold-storage by the Governor, stayed the legislation.The law giving state govt the power to appoint VCs to universities was stayed along with nine other laws, Bills for which were reserved for the President’s consideration by the governor but were regarded as deemed to have been approved by President in a controversial unprecedented ruling by a two-judge SC bench on Apr 8.Three days after the ‘deemed to have been approved’ ruling by the SC, which now is subject to a Constitution bench’s opinion on a Presidential Reference questioning the use of Article 142 power of the SC to virtually obliterate roles assigned by the Constitution to President and Governors on Bills passed by Assemblies, the TN govt had notified the nine bills as laws.The bench refused to stay the HC order but asked the UGC and the public interest litigation petitioner before the HC to respond to TN’s petition in four weeks.For UGC, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the law is palpably contrary to the UGC Regulations which empower only governors to appoint VCs to the universities.When the senior advocates pleaded that they would argue before the HC for vacation of the stay, Mehta said that in that case the TN must withdraw its petition seeking transfer of the PIL from Madras HC to the SC. “The state cannot have both options open at the same time and be permitted to argue before the HC that the SC is considering transfer of the PIL to itself,” he said.Wilson sought expunging of certain ‘harsh remarks’ against him by the HC merely because he was pointing out the SC’s 2-J bench order. Justices Narasimha and Mahadevan said this request would be considered by the SC during the final hearing on the TN’s petition.One of the Acts, notified on Apr 11 by the state related to vesting in the state govt the powers of the Governor, as Chancellor, to appoint vice-chancellors of universities in the state. A vacation bench of the HC on May 21 granted stay on this amending provision, holding that UGC Regulations, 2018, would prevail over the state legislation by virtue of doctrine of repugnancy.The state said it had raised the objection to the delay in filing of the PIL but the division bench of the HC “did not even call for an explanation from the Registry of the HC or the Petitioner but proceeded to hear the case in a tearing hurry.” The HC “showed undue haste”, did not even give a week’s time to the state to file its counter affidavit, and passed the stay order “for extraneous reasons”, it said, adding that the impugned order is replete with personal attacks on the senior counsel who appeared for the state.","The law giving state govt the power to appoint vcs to universities was stayed along with nine other laws. Tamil nadu fielded a team of senior advocates – a m singhvi, rakesh dwivedi and p wilson.

When Raj meets Uddhav (again): Thackerays to hold joint 'victory' rally today; reunite over Hindi 'imposition',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-raj-meets-uddhav-again-thackerays-to-hold-joint-victory-rally-today-reunite-over-hindi-imposition/articleshow/122260461.cms,"Raj Thackeray (left), and Uddhav Thackeray.

NEW DELHI: For the first time in 20 years, Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) president Raj Thackeray will share the stage on Saturday. The two leaders will address a joint ""victory"" rally organised by their parties to mark the withdrawal of government resolutions (GRs) related to the three-language policy.The rally is being held at the NSCI Dome in central Mumbai's Worli, which falls in the assembly constituency of Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray. The gathering is also seen as significant ahead of the upcoming local body elections, including the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls.Uddhav and Raj Thackeray, whose parties have been vocal on the issues of Marathi language and identity, last shared a stage in 2005 during the Malvan assembly bypoll campaign. That was after former chief minister Narayan Rane had left the undivided Shiv Sena. Raj Thackeray quit the party later that year and launched the MNS in 2006.The rally comes in the backdrop of protests against the April 16 GR issued by the BJP-led Mahayuti government in Maharashtra, which made Hindi a compulsory third language for students from Classes 1 to 5 in English and Marathi medium schools. Following backlash, the government amended the GR on June 17, making Hindi optional.On June 29, the cabinet decided to withdraw both GRs entirely.On the same day, leaders from Shiv Sena (UBT) and MNS had burnt copies of the GRs and had planned a protest march for July 5. After the rollback, both parties decided to hold a joint ""victory"" event instead. Uddhav and Raj had then said the government blinked after witnessing the unity of Maharashtrians and did not want them to come together.Though the two parties have chosen not to display any party flags, symbols, hoardings or scarves during the event, the political significance of the rally is being seen in the backdrop of their recent electoral performance. In the 2024 Maharashtra assembly elections, the Shiv Sena (UBT) won 20 seats while the MNS failed to win any.The parties have invited other political groups that opposed the GRs, as well as members of the literary and art community, to take part in the rally.The Congress, a partner in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance with Shiv Sena (UBT), has however said it will not attend the event. State Congress president Harshwardhan Sapkal said the party supports the stand against making Hindi mandatory but will not join the rally.NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) president Sharad Pawar also said in Pune on Thursday that he would not be attending due to prior commitments. However, NCP (SP) state president Jayant Patil said the party would be represented either by working president Supriya Sule or MLA Jitendra Awhad. Patil said MNS leader Bala Nandgaonkar had personally invited the NCP (SP).The rally takes place amid recent incidents involving both parties. MNS activists were seen on camera assaulting a food stall owner for not speaking Marathi. In another case, two people were made to apologise to a man in front of Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Rajan Vichare for allegedly attacking him. “Speak in Marathi since you have hit a Marathi person,” a voice is heard telling one of the two men while he tries to say something to Vichare, a former MP from Thane.",Uddhav and raj thackeray last shared a stage in 2005 during the malvan assembly bypoll campaign. The gathering is also seen as significant ahead of the upcoming local body elections. The rally comes in the backdrop of protests against the april 16 gr issued by the bjp-led mahayuti government in maharashtra.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122260655,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1032917,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

PATNA/NEW DELHI: RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav led a delegation of the opposition INDIA bloc to meet Bihar’s chief electoral officer (CEO) on Friday, lodging strong objections to the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of the electoral roll.The opposition claimed the Election Commission’s current exercise is “impractical and anti-democratic”. They demanded the inclusion of Aadhaar card , ration card and MGNREGA card as valid documents for voter verification under the SIR process in Bihar.Sharing a personal experience with reporters after the meeting, Tejashwi said, “My wife’s voter ID card was made on the basis of aadhaar card. Why is the aadhaar card excluded from the list of documents required for the SIR in Bihar?” he asked.EC officials here in Delhi clarified that the Aadhaar card was kept out of the list of 11 specified documents for SIR, as Aadhaar is neither a proof of date or place of birth, nor of one's Indian citizenship. ""It just defines that the 10-fingerprints, photo and iris belong to the person in whose name the card is issued. In fact, every Aadhaar card mentions in bold that ""Aadhaar is a proof of identity and not of one's citizenship or date of birth"".EC officials also mentioned that the Trinamool Congress, in its interactions with the commission, has consistently and strongly opposed linking EPIC with Aadhaar.Tejashwi also questioned the short 25-day window to verify 8 crore voters. ""Around 4 crore voters from Bihar live outside the state. How can they return so soon to verify their bona fides?” he asked.The RJD delegation that called on the Bihar CEO comprised state president Manganilal Mandal, MPs Manoj Kumar Jha and Sanjay Yadav, former minister Alok Kumar Mehta, state spokesperson Chittaranjan Gagan, Congress state president Rajesh Ram, legislative party leader Shakeel Ahmed, Sanjay Pandey, VIP’s Mukesh Sahani, CPI-ML’s Kumar Parvez, CPI’s Ram Naresh Pandey and CPI-M’s Lalan Chaudhary.","Tejashwi prasad yadav led a delegation of the opposition india bloc to meet bihar’s chief electoral officer (ceo) on friday.

87% enumeration forms distributed in Bihar; 5% filled up & returned; documents can be added later,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/87-enumeration-forms-distributed-in-bihar-5-filled-up-returned-documents-can-be-added-later/articleshow/122260452.cms,"Special intensive roll revision (SIR) completed in Bihar

NEW DELHI: Booth level officers (BLOs) on Friday completed door-to-door visits to the state’s nearly 1.5 crore households as part of the ongoing special intensive roll revision (SIR), distributing enumeration forms to over 87 per cent or over 6.8 crore, of Bihar’s 7.9 crore electorate. Already, 38 lakh or 5 per cent filled-up and signed enumeration forms, with or without the specified documents, have been received by the BLOs, with the figure expected to touch 15 per cent on Saturday.Sources in the election commission (EC) told TOI that even where enumeration forms are short on one or more required documents, there shall be a window for the elector concerned to submit them anytime before July 25, the last date for submission of the completed enumeration forms. “All those who turn in their filled-up forms by July 25 will be included in the draft electoral roll to be published on August 1, 2025,” said an EC official adding that the BLOs are working with the motto “inclusion first”.“In order to get one’s name in the draft electoral roll, the strict condition is to sign and submit the pre-printed enumeration form before July 25. This step will filter out non-existent voters, either dead or migrated ones who are no longer ordinary residents of that assembly constituency,” said an EC officer.Though BLOs will give their recommendation while submitting/uploading the filled up enumeration form, the electoral registration officer (ERO) or assistant ERO (AERO) is expected to scrutinise the forms “not recommended” by BLOs only after draft rolls are published on August 1.Claims and objections to the draft electoral roll can be filed from August 1 to September 1. “Based on the documents attached or not attached, eligibility verification of each name in the draft roll will start vigorously from August 2 onwards, which is also the date from which political parties or any member of the public can file claims and objections,” said an officer.EROs and AEROs will scrutinise the forms against the eligibility criteria laid down in Article 326, which requires electors to Indian citizens, not less than 18 years of age and ordinarily resident in the constituency.Asked about the remaining 13 per cent enumeration forms still not distributed by BLOs, EC said these could be on account of locked houses, dead electors, migrants or those who may be travelling. BLO will be making two more house visits in such cases.Electors who miss the July 25 deadline can still apply for inclusion during the claims and objections period using Form 6. The over 1.5 lakh booth level agents (BLAs) appointed by political parties, including 52,689 by the BJP 47,504 by RJD, 34,660 by JD(U) and 16,500 by the Congress, can continue to submit up to 10 forms per day even after the draft roll is published.The final electoral roll will be published on September 30, 2025. Those still aggrieved can file first appeal with the district magistrate and final one with the chief electoral officer.Further additions to the electoral roll can be made even after the Bihar poll is announced, that is, till the last day of filing of nominations.","Special intensive roll revision (sir) completed in bihar.

"On choosing life, always",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/on-choosing-life-always/articleshow/122249739.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. Rithanya was just 27. Within barely 70 days of marriage, she ended her life . Before she slipped away, she sent seven audio notes to her father—apologising for the path she had chosen, unable—she said—to bear the harassment allegedly inflicted by her husband and in-laws. In one voice note, she whispered the most haunting of farewells: “I can’t live this life anymore.” We don’t know the full story. Investigations will unearth the details, and justice, hopefully, will find its way. Almost every human being, at some point, faces that bleak moment where they glance at the abyss, thinking, this is the only way out. But from deep within, something stirs—a raw instinct to survive. We rise. We whisper to ourselves, not yet. Not like this. But for many, it does. India accounts for nearly 38% of global suicide deaths among women and nearly 26% among men. Suicide is the leading cause of death for youngsters. One in three of them takes the step due to family issues. Psychologist Roy Baumeister described suicide as a response to a mind overwhelmed by failure, guilt, and self-loathing. The person visualises not only death, but the aftermath—grief, regret, even revenge. Death becomes not an end, but a statement. What drives this despair? Sometimes, it’s as trivial as a failed exam or a teacher’s rebuke. A heartbreak. Or, as in Rithanya’s case, the crushing belief that “marriage happens only once,” and breaking it is a sin beyond survival . Monogamy is a noble ideal. And yes, history is filled with those who have given up their lives for ideals. But a sacrifice earns nobility only when it serves a higher purpose—when it uplifts others, preserves truth, or advances justice. To give up one’s life because an ideal was challenged by personal suffering is not bravery, but tragedy. Parents, too, must unlearn the habit of clinging to social approval. Let your children fail, stumble, choose differently. If they want to walk out of a marriage, quit a course, skip an exam—so be it. What matters is not community whispers, but their heartbeat. Let them live. Let them outlive us. Let’s tell them that courage lies not in silent endurance, but in speaking out, walking away, or beginning afresh. For centuries, societies glorified suicide in the name of honour. Even Thirukkural praises those who choose death over disgrace: Ilivarin Vaazhadha Maanam Udayaar OliThozhudhu Eththum Ulagu. “The world will always praise and adore the fame of the honorable Who would rather die than suffer indignity.” But remember the context of such couplets. They were meant for warriors and tribes that fought for their identities. Extending them to individuals who are challenged by life events and threatened by societal norms may be in-appropriate. Let the new ideal be this: Honour belongs to those who live. Pride rests with the resilient. Let us stop eulogising those who fall into darkness and instead uplift those who walk through it. If Ridhanya had whispered to herself, ‘ one year from now, none of this will matter’, perhaps she might have lived. Her parents might have been spared a grief no justice can heal. We owe our children a new legacy—not one of quiet suffering, but of radiant survival. Because in the end, life is precious, and to live it—truly live it—takes more courage than we ever speak of.","Thirukkural with the times explores real-world lessons from the classic tamil text.

PUNE: A man, posing as a courier delivery agent, entered a 22-year-old data scientist's 11th floor rented flat in a residential society in Kondhwa on Wednesday evening, sprayed some chemical on her face and allegedly raped her.""He also used the woman's cellphone to click a selfie with her, cropped his image and keyed in a message threatening her that he would upload the photograph on social media if she disclosed the incident to anyone,"" deputy commissioner of police (Zone IV) Rajkumar Shinde told TOI on Thursday. ""We have seen the cropped selfie image and the message on the survivor's phone after collecting the gadget from her,"" he said.The woman, who has a BE degree in data science, works with an IT firm in Kalyaninagar and has been staying with her younger brother (20) in the rented flat since 2022, an office-bearer of the society told TOI. The society is made up of a single 11-storey building divided into ‘A', ‘B' and ‘C' wings. It has a single entrance gate with a security cabin having two guards each in the morning and night shifts and also has an app for community and safety management of the residents.The woman and her brother are from Akola. They shifted to Pune a few years ago for employment. Her brother had gone to Akola, and she was alone in the flat when the ""delivery agent"" came calling, police said.DCP Shinde said: ""The woman said in her complaint that she responded to the doorbell around 7.15pm and found a man, who claimed to be from a courier firm, waiting. The man told her that he needs to deliver a parcel from a bank. He asked her to acknowledge receipt of the parcel by signing on a delivery sheet he was carrying, and told her that he had forgotten his pen. When the woman went in to bring the pen, the man seized the moment to step in and bolted the door from inside before using the spray on her face. ""He said: ""The woman regained consciousness around 8.30pm and sensed something wrong was done to her. She alerted her relatives, who, in turn, informed the police. She has been admitted to a govt hospital for medical examination. Our forensic experts will examine what kind of chemical substance the intruder used to spray on her face. For now, 10 teams from the Kondhwa police and the city crime branch have been deployed to work on leads to arrest the culprit. ""Experts visited the crime scene and collected forensic evidence. A spot panchnama was drawn. A dog squad was pressed into service, but it did not pick up the trail of the culprit, police said.""We have identified 10 delivery agents from courier and e-commerce firms and food delivery services, who visited the society on Wednesday and are verifying them,"" said an officer, who is part of the probe. The police have registered a case relating to offences punishable under sections 64 (rape), 77 (voyeurism) and 351(2) (criminal intimidation) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.Pune police commissioner Amitesh Kumar told TOI: ""We have collected the survivor's oral and nasal swab to establish the chemical substance alleged to have been used to render the survivor unconscious. We are certain about detecting the case soon and have roped in all our resources considering the nature and gravity of the crime.""Also read: Pune rape case: 'Delivery agent' who assaulted techie in flat arrested after 2 days; police investigating Preliminary investigation revealed that the intruder did not make an entry in the visitors' register maintained by the society.

The guards on duty have so far maintained that there was no entry or exit of any person around the time of the incident nor any outsider has been spotted in CCTV covering the passage leading to the ‘A' wing where the survivor stays.A society office bearer told TOI at the site: ""The brother-sister duo share a cordial relationship with all our members and have been paying their rent on time to the flat owner, who lives in Mumbai. The society is covered by two CCTV cameras. The 'A' wing, where the incident occurred, has CCTV cameras covering the passage, parts of the other wings and the parking area.""He said: ""We have installed a mobile application, a visitor management facility, to regulate entry on the society premises. Each member and tenant of the society has this application on their mobiles. We studied all the entries and exits on the application and realised that no delivery persons — like food delivery, quick commerce or e-commerce — entered the society when the incident occurred. We have provided all details of the cellphone application and CCTV footage to the police. ""The office-bearer added: ""Only one thing could have happened. A delivery person, who has four or five deliveries to make in different flats, could have entered the society and then might have gone to the woman's flat. It does not require a separate entry on the mobile application when it comes to multiple deliveries.""","A man, posing as a courier delivery agent, entered a 22-year-old data scientist's 11th floor rented flat in a residential society in kondhwa on wednesday evening.

NEW DELHI: In a horrific double murder, a 24-year-old worker in a garment shop entered the Lajpat Nagar residence of his employer and slit the throats of his wife and teenage son on Wednesday evening.

However, police said they were yet to ascertain the motive and would interrogate him after he arrived in Delhi late on Thursday.The victims were identified as Ruchika Sewani (42) and her son Krish (14). The family lived in F block, Lajpat Nagar, and ran a garment business from an establishment in the same locality. The murders took place around 7.30pm and were discovered over two hours later.Police received a PCR call at 9.43pm on Wednesday from Kuldeep Sewani (44), saying his wife Ruchika and son Krish were not responding to calls.Arnab (22), a neighbour of the Sewanis, said the worker sent by Kuldeep to the house had called back with grim news.""The worker saw bloodstains at the gate and on the stairs, and informed Kuldeep that the phone was ringing inside the house. Kuldeep rushed home and kept knocking on our door.

They had been attacked with a sharp object and had deep neck injuries.He added that the incident came to light around 9.30pm. Due to the sound of their air conditioner, no one had heard anything unusual during the assault.Police began reviewing CCTV footage from the area. In one of the cameras, they spotted Mukesh coming out of the building. This raised suspicion and police sent out an inter-state alert. Soon, Mukesh was apprehended by UP police at Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Junction while attempting to flee on a train.Deputy Commissioner of Police (southeast) Hemant Tiwari said a murder case was registered. According to police sources, the accused claimed he took a Rs 45,000 advance due to financial need. Ruchika gave him the money but he started taking leaves and stopped answering her calls. Eventually, she managed to contact him through an employee, and he agreed to return the advance and hand back a phone. However, he flew into a rage over a woman having scolded him.The source said he went to Ruchika's house, which was on the ground floor, and rang the bell. She let him in thinking he had come to talk about why he wasn't coming to the shop. ""He gave her no chance and started attacking her with a sharp object,"" the source added.Hearing his mother's scream, the son, who had returned from cricket coaching session, tried to save her but was also attacked. He tried to hide in the bathroom but Mukesh got to him. The murder weapon is yet to be recovered. The accused entered the house between 7pm and 7.30pm, about 10 minutes after Ruchika arrived home from the shop.Police are probing whether Mukesh had cut the CCTV camera wire before entering.

The selfie was taken by the woman herself, and she also typed the purported threatening message,” Pune Police Commissioner Amitesh Kumar told reporters on Friday, as reported by PTI.Earlier, the woman had claimed that an unknown man posing as a courier delivery agent entered her flat in Kondhwa on Wednesday evening, bolted the door, and had allegedly raped her after spraying a chemical that caused her to pass out. She later said the attacker left behind a threatening note and a selfie taken using her mobile phone, partially showing his face.However, after detaining the suspect—described as a highly qualified professional—police said the original image had clearly shown the man’s full face but was later edited. Commissioner Kumar added, “No chemical spray was used. The girl’s mental state is not good at present. The rape part is still under investigation.”The woman had initially told police that the man entered her home by claiming he had a parcel from a bank, then asked for a pen. When she turned her back, he entered, latched the door, and assaulted her. She claimed to have passed out and regained consciousness around 8.30 pm, after which she called her relatives, and the police were alerted.The original case, registered under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita sections 64 (rape), 77 (voyeurism), and 351(2) (criminal intimidation), had triggered a swift police response. Forensic experts were brought in to examine her and collect samples. CCTV footage from the housing society showed no trace of the alleged courier agent, and no visitor entries had been logged in the app-based system used by the society.Earlier, Deputy Commissioner of Police Rajkumar Shinde had said, “We have seen the cropped selfie and the message on the survivor’s phone after collecting the gadget from her.”The woman, who works with an IT company in Kalyaninagar, had been living with her younger brother in a rented flat since 2022. Her brother was away on the day of the alleged incident.","Pune police now say the alleged attacker was not a stranger but someone known to the woman.

Make J&K dry like Gujarat: Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/make-jk-dry-like-gujarat-hurriyat-leader-mirwaiz/articleshow/122257107.cms,"SRINAGAR: Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq called Friday for J&K to be made a “dry state like Gujarat” as he opposed authorities’ move to open more liquor shops, claiming such steps were “a deliberate attempt to push our youths further into addiction”.“J&K is a Muslim-majority region and sale and consumption of liquor is against Islam’s tenets,” Mirwaiz said during Friday prayers at Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid. The trigger was a protest the previous day by locals in Srinagar’s Batmaloo against the opening of a liquor shop in the area that had not seen such outlets for decades.“If Gujarat can be declared a dry state, there is no reason why J&K should be exempted,” Mirwaiz said. This was the first call to protest in recent months on any issue from Mirwaiz, who is also chief cleric of Kashmir and has been put in home detention ahead of Friday prayers on many occasions in the past few months.Mirwaiz urged the state’s Omar Abdullah-led National Conference govt and lieutenant-governor Manoj Sinha to check the trend. “If govt does not act, we will be forced to protest. This isn’t a minor issue,” Mirwaiz said.Authorities have linked the new liquor licences and shops to a spurt in tourism since the 2019 abrogation of J&K’s special status under Article 370. In the case of Batmaloo, excise officials claimed the shop, now shut after the agitation, was not a new one and had been only relocated from another area.Despite such opposition, J&K’s alcohol sales are on the rise. The Omar-led govt’s economic survey earlier this year estimated excise revenues at Rs 2,000 crore in 2024-25, up 4% over the previous year.Mirwaiz rejected the argument that liquor sales were necessary for tourism, pointing out that J&K had welcomed visitors for centuries without promoting alcohol. “Has J&K become a tourist spot only after 2019 (Article 370 abrogation)? For hundreds of years, tourists have visited us but liquor was never promoted on this scale in every locality,” Mirwaiz said.Drawing a comparison with Gujarat, Mirwaiz stressed that alcohol was banned there due to its impact on society and asked why similar concerns were not valid for J&K. “Don’t we have a society? Don’t we have to live here, too,” Mirwaiz said.According to him, over 1 lakh people in J&K are already affected by drug addiction and govt’s fillip to alcohol sales will only aggravate the crisis.Some local Kashmiri Pandits led by an activist, Sandeep Mawa, had recently demanded a ban on liquor sales in the Valley. In March this year, PDP MLA Fayaz Ahmad Mir had introduced a private member’s bill seeking such a ban across J&K. But the bill was not taken up for discussion or voting in the assembly. BJP, too, has expressed support for the ban, with former J&K party chief Ravinder Raina having led protests on the issue earlier.","Hurriyat conference chairman mirwaiz umar farooq called for j&k to be made a ‘dry state like gujarat’ he opposed authorities’ move to open more liquor shops, claiming such steps were “a deliberate attempt to push our youths further into addiction’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122257172,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1585837,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Even CUET high scorers upset over discrepancies

NEW DELHI: Two woman candidates feature among the top three in the Common University Entrance Test for Undergraduate programmes (CUET-UG 2025), results for which were declared by National Testing Agency Friday. But declaration of results has not stopped candidates, including high scorers, from questioning syllabus deviations, errors in question papers and response sheets, as well as the normalisation process.Ananya Jain from Punjab, with an aggregate of 1225.93, emerged as the topper and was the only candidate to secure 100 percentile in four of the five subjects opted for. Arjav Jain from Delhi secured the second-highest score, followed by Purva Singh from Haryana.Aneesh Jain from Rajasthan was in fourth place, followed by Raghav Saraf from Haryana.Around 13.54 lakh students registered for the exam this year, marginally higher than 13.47 lakh in 2024, but the number of candidates who appeared dropped to 10.71 lakh from 11.13 lakh last year.In the top 20 candidates, five are from Haryana, three from Delhi, two each from Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Karnataka, and one each from Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Odisha, West Bengal and Maharashtra.This year, candidates scored full marks (250) in just five subjects, compared to full marks (200) being achieved in 45 subjects in 2024. The test covered 37 subjects and 13 languages, and was conducted over 19 days across 300 cities, including 15 international locations. The number of universities participating fell to 239 from 283 in 2024, indicating that some institutions opted out amid concerns about the test's evolving framework and operational challenges.Among subjects, psychology, political science, business studies, Punjabi, and Urdu saw candidates achieving the highest possible score of 250, while the top score in physical education was as low as 219, highlighting variations across disciplines. Seventeen candidates scored 100 percentile in three subjects, 150 managed it in two subjects, and 2,679 aspirants scored 100 percentile in one subject.Candidates continued to express frustration on social media over the exam and many have written to the education ministry seeking remedial action. Even high scorers voiced disappointment over discrepancies. Matangsih Zula from Ahmedabad, who wrote to the local MP and the ministry, said he had raised concerns with NTA about errors in response sheets and answer keys a month ago but got no reply. Zula, who scored 99 percentile in GAT, 97 in English, 94.5 in mathematics and 93 in economics, had challenged six questions in the provisional key, of which three were later corrected.Candidates particularly highlighted issues with the physical education paper, alleging that despite formal challenges, the agency failed to revise key answers. Aspirants pointed out that Unit 3 in the official syllabus allowed them to choose ""one sport of their choice,"" but the test carried mandatory questions from multiple sports. NTA had earlier stated: ""The panel of subject experts decided not to provide options in Unit 3, as it was deemed impractical. Questions included in the paper were fundamental in nature"". The response failed to allay concerns.","Ananya jain from punjab emerged as the topper and was the only candidate to secure 100 percentile in four of the five subjects opted for.
