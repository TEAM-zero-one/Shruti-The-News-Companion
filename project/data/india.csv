KOLKATA: Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday asserted that the BJP will come to power in West Bengal in the 2026 assembly elections. The Union Education Minister also accused the Mamata Banerjee government of putting roadblocks to the implementation of central projects in West Bengal , while falsely accusing the Centre of ignoring the state.""BJP's vote share in West Bengal has been around 30-40 per cent since 2019 and if the party gets another 10 per cent of votes, it will dislodge the Mamata Banerjee government from power,"" Pradhan said while addressing a press meet here on the salient features of Union budget.Stating that the rout of Aam Admi Party (AAP) in Delhi assembly elections showed people's overwhelming faith in the BJP and the rejection of the ""corrupt"" Arvind Kejriwal government, Pradhan said in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, BJP made its mark in West Bengal by bagging 18 of the 42 seats in the state.""We won 77 seats in the 2021 assembly polls and 12 Lok Sabha seats in the 2024 general elections. BJP's voting percentage has been around 30-40 per cent since 2019 and we need another 10 per cent of the votes to come to power in West Bengal. In 2026, we will be in power in the state,"" he said.Pradhan said that when he was the Union Petroleum Minister, he wanted to set up a 710-km gas pipeline connecting Odisha, Jharkhand and West Bengal.However, the West Bengal portion remains to be implemented even after seven years despite taking up the issue with the state government on several occasions, he said.Pradhan accused the TMC government of not giving land for extending the pipeline to West Bengal and not cooperating with the Centre for implementing railway projects and establishing more Navodaya schools in the state.""The TMC regime perhaps thinks Prime Minister Narendra Modi will get the credit if any centrally sponsored project is implemented in the state. While the railways has hiked annual allocation to West Bengal from Rs 4,000 crore during the UPA rule to Rs 13,995 crore since the NDA came to power in 2014, the state government has failed to convert the hike by implementing railway projects,"" he alleged, adding it is sitting on many projects which affect the people.On the education sector, Pradhan said the state is unfairly criticising the University Grants Commission (UGC) for its draft guideline which accorded the power to the chancellor to run the affairs of state-run universities, including the appointment of vice chancellors, going by the recommendations of the search committee constituted by the Supreme Court.""UGC is not a political party... it is an autonomous body having a key role in the functioning of universities in the country. The role and primacy of the UGC had been acknowledged by the Supreme Court in the past. But the TMC-run government in West Bengal is bent on undermining the authority of the UGC. The state education minister is regularly criticising the UGC and the governor, who is the chancellor of state universities as per well-laid-out principles and rules,"" he said.""One recommendation of UGC guideline calls for appointing college and university assistant professors based on their skills in language. If Mamata Banerjee believes in giving scope to people having proficiency in Bengali, she should not object to the appointment of any such eligible candidate,"" the Union minister said.Similarly, the state had objected to the New Education Policy of the Centre though several of its features had been incorporated by the state education department while other states had publicly praised the NEP, Pradhan said, alleging that the West Bengal government opposes any scheme only for political considerations.The West Bengal government and Governor C V Ananda Bose had been at loggerheads over the appointment of vice chancellors of state-run universities.Dwelling on the budget, Pradhan said that on the education front, it has the objective to inculcate scientific temperament and quest for innovation among children.The government has already set up 10,000 Atal Tinkering Labs (ATL) to whet the appetite for out-of-the-box innovation ideas among the students which is a teaching-research innovation, he said.He sought the state's cooperation in implementing the initiative aimed at holistic development of children.The Union Education Minister said the Bharatiya Bhasha Pustak Yojana aims at the NEP 2020 vision of promoting multilingualism in education.""Hope the TMC government in West Bengal will understand the merit of the Bharatiya Bhasa Pustak Yojana if they believe in children learning in their mother tongue, if they (TMC) are really serious and committed about children having clarity in thoughts. Otherwise, their opposition will be again due to political considerations,"" he said.He said the Centre is providing internet connectivity to 1.3 lakh government-run schools across the country.","Bjp's vote share in west bengal has been around 30-40 per cent since 2019.

A Reflection of Voter Sentiment A Major Political Shift

NEW DELHI: As AAP reels from its crushing defeat in the Delhi elections, social activist Anna Hazare has delivered a scathing rebuke of Arvind Kejriwal, blaming his downfall on greed for power and money. Hazare, who once mentored Kejriwal during the anti-corruption movement, said their ties ended when the AAP leader ""took the wrong path."" Criticising the liquor policy, Anna said that the AAP leader's focus on power and liquor policies ultimately led to the party's demise after more than a decade in power.""Initially, I was not unhappy with him, but when he took the wrong path, came into power, and his thinking changed—focusing on liquor shops and all—our ties ended,"" Hazare said. ""Alcohol causes immense suffering to women. I am 90 but still healthy; if I had consumed alcohol, I would not be healthy,"" he added.The activist recalled Kejriwal’s earlier promises of simplicity and service to the people, which he believes were abandoned once AAP came to power. ""He used to say that he will stay in a small room all his life... Happiness is not found outside... Doing good work for society makes one happy from within. He did not understand this... Otherwise, he would have never thought of making the 'Sheesh Mahal',"" Hazare said.Speaking from his village Ralegan Siddhi, Hazare criticised Kejriwal's choices, saying that Kejriwal's governance strayed from the principles they had once fought for. ""When he formed the party, people trusted and supported him. Later, however, he started promoting liquor and went after money, which has drowned him and his party today,"" Hazare remarked.Hazare’s remarks come in the wake of AAP’s crushing defeat in the Delhi assembly elections, where the BJP secured over two-thirds of the seats, ending more than a decade of AAP’s rule in the capital. Kejriwal himself lost his long-held New Delhi seat to BJP’s Parvesh Verma by 4,089 votes. Other AAP bigwigs, including former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and senior party figures like Satyendra Jain and Saurabh Bharadwaj, also faced defeats.The BJP’s return to power in Delhi after 27 years was met with strong remarks from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who called it a “historic” victory. ""The people of Delhi have driven out 'AAP-da'. Delhi has been freed from the 'AAP-da',"" Modi said in his victory speech, using a play on words to compare AAP to a disaster. He credited the victory to the BJP’s commitment to development and governance.","Social activist anna hazare has delivered a scathing rebuke of arvind kejriwal.

Looking ahead

NEW DELHI: The BJP’s victory in the Milkipur bypoll has reasserted its political dominance in Uttar Pradesh, countering the blow from its Faizabad defeat eight months ago. The win is seen as a strategic move to regain lost ground and bolster Dalit support.The Faizabad loss was a major jolt for the BJP, given Ayodhya's significance to its Hindutva agenda. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav had flaunted Faizabad MP Awadhesh Prasad, a Dalit, as a political trophy, reinforcing the opposition’s stronghold. However, BJP recalibrated its approach, leading to what its workers termed a well-planned “Ayodhya ka badla.”Surya Pratap Shahi, BJP’s in-charge of Ayodhya, described the win as a people-driven correction after the 2024 setback. Chandrabhanu Paswan, 38, emerged victorious with a margin of 61,710 votes over SP’s Ajit Prasad, 42. Both parties had fielded Pasi candidates, emphasizing the crucial Dalit vote bank.The BJP’s loss in Faizabad, despite the Ram Temple consecration, prompted a narrative shift. SP’s allegations about BJP’s stance on Dalit and OBC reservations forced the party to adopt a softer engagement approach.Under its ‘Samvidhan Gaurav Samman’ initiative, BJP leaders distributed Constitution copies and conducted outreach programs to reaffirm their commitment to social justice. “We personally engaged with community members to counter misinformation and rebuild trust,” UP BJP secretary Abhijat Mishra told PTI.The Milkipur victory featured in PM Narendra Modi’s post-Delhi poll speech. “Our margin in Milkipur surpasses SP’s in Faizabad, demonstrating public faith in BJP’s leadership,” said Paswan.UP Minorities Minister Danish Azad Ansari asserted that even Muslim voters backed the BJP. “With around 38,000 Muslims in Milkipur, many chose development over divisive politics. Meanwhile, the SP-Congress alliance is showing cracks,” he stated.Milkipur, historically dominated by Communist, SP, and BSP influences, has now positioned itself as a key battleground in BJP’s UP strategy.The loss has given BSP an opportunity to hit back at SP. “SP often blamed BSP for its failures, but we didn’t even contest here. Why did they lose?” Mayawati questioned.While SP leaders claim electoral malpractice, internal discussions suggest the decision to field the sitting MP’s son might have contributed to the defeat.BJP’s triumph in Milkipur signals an aggressive comeback in Ayodhya’s political landscape, reinforcing its strategic pivot towards Dalit empowerment. With the 2024 Lok Sabha elections still fresh, the results set the stage for high-stakes battles ahead in UP politics.","Chandrabhanu paswan, 38, emerged victorious with a margin of 61,710 votes over sp’s ajit prasad, 42.

R G Kar incident proves system rotten in Bengal: Pradhan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/r-g-kar-incident-proves-system-rotten-in-bengal-pradhan/articleshow/118088515.cms,"KOLKATA: Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday alleged that the rape and murder of a post-graduate trainee doctor at state-run R G Kar Medical College and Hospital here proves that the system is rotten in West Bengal where 'goondas' are inducted into social policing initiatives like civic police . Pradhan, who was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an event here, further commented that such an incident is a matter of worry for a republic like India.""What happened in R G Kar is a matter of grave concern. The induction of goondas into social policing shows the system is rotten. It is worrying for the republic,"" he said.Pradhan was alluding to the conviction of Kolkata Police civic volunteer Sanjay Roy in the rape and murder case of August 9 last year.The family and agitating junior doctors have, however, alleged that Roy could not have been the lone person involved in the crime and it was a larger conspiracy involving many others who were around on the night of the incident.Inducting youths who meet certain criteria as civic volunteers to help police personnel in maintaining law and order and manning traffic has been a social welfare project of the TMC government since it came to power. Allegations of excesses by civic volunteers had been received several times in the past.""We wish the family gets justice at the earliest. Their daughter represents every single woman of the country. We have faith in the agency (CBI). We have to wait with patience,"" he said.The birthday of the R G Kar medic is on Sunday and her parents and protestors have called for a rally for justice on the occasion.To a question about the state allegedly taking disciplinary steps against some protesting junior doctors, Pradhan said, ""No protest for justice for the victim should be belittled in any way.""Asked about the recent alleged rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl in the New Town area near the city, Pradhan said Mamata Banerjee as the chief minister should ensure that such crimes don't take place against any daughter of the country.""Every sensitive person should treat any such incident seriously. Otherwise, people of West Bengal will protest.

Watch: Delhi Election Results 2025 LIVE | BJP Vs AAP Vs Congress | Arvind Kejriwal | PM Modi | FASTEST UPDATES

NEW DELHI: Promises are free, keeping them is costly.Once election euphoria has settled, knuckling down on the math to keep the 'revdis' flowing is an onerous job. Governments in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra have found this out. The new Delhi government is about to as well.On its way to wresting Delhi from AAP, BJP made several ambitious commitments to voters to outplay Kejriwal on his pet social welfare pitch. The principal ones that will further stretch the balance sheet are the promise of a monthly guarantee of Rs 2,500 to women and a monthly pension of Rs 2,500 for seniors (rising to Rs 3,000 for 70-plus). BJP has also promised Rs 21,000 for expectant mothers and free education from KG to PG.The enormity of the task the new regime has at hand in putting together finances for these promises can be gauged from the latest revenue and expenditure projections of the state. Delhi government projected a total tax revenue collection of Rs 58,750 crore in 2024-25, against last year's Rs 53,680 crore.The budget for the fiscal is Rs 76,000 crore, with the largest spend of 22% earmarked for education - a focal point of the AAP regime - at Rs 16,396 crore, followed by housing and urban development at Rs 9,800 crore (13%), healthcare and public health at Rs 8,685 crore (11%), transport infrastructure at Rs 7,470 crore (10%), water supply and sanitation at Rs 7,195 crore (9%), and social security and welfare at Rs 6,694 crore (9%) as the major heads.With more than two-thirds of revenues being spent on salaries and establishment costs, the finance department had expressed worries last year about sliding into deficit for the first time. An exacerbating factor was a projected decline in revenues from taxes, non-tax sources and central receipts from Rs 64,142 crore to Rs 62,415 crore by the conclusion of the 2024-25 fiscal year.Now, for the monthly guarantee of Rs 2,500 for underprivileged women, the income criteria for which is yet to be fixed, the exchequer is expected to face a heavy burden. While the new government works the calculators, an idea of how much this could be can be drawn from a similar scheme previously proposed by AAP for which around 38 lakh women qualified. The annual cost for it was projected to be Rs 11,000 crore.On to the pension promise, Election Commission data shows Delhi has 24,44,476 residents above 60 years, of whom 13,78,797 are in the Rs 2,500 (60-69) bracket. This part of the pension plan will require an annual allocation of Rs 4,100 crore.Other promises made by BJP - like cleaning the Yamuna, which became one of the biggest talking points of this election, and Delhi's landfills in three years - will also need substantial allocations. Over the years, government has spent around Rs 8,000 crore on the Yamuna.Sources said to meet expenses for new and ongoing welfare schemes, the new Delhi government will need more than Rs 25,000 crore annually (including Rs 11,000 crore to continue free water and electricity schemes of the AAP government). Asked if Delhi can receive a special package from the Centre, given its status as a Union Territory, a source said, ""Considering the AAP government was running under financial liability of Rs 18,000 crore, the new government will have to be rigid in its revenue distribution and divert funds from capital expenditure or other sectors to fund all the new welfare schemes. The second option can be seeking the Centre's help.""The new dispensation will get a month to work on the maths to get funds for its promised schemes, with the budget for the new fiscal to be presented in March.Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva said the central government had previously offered financial support for various initiatives, including Ayushman Bharat Yojana. ""But AAP in Delhi was not ready to extend benefit of these scheme to the people of Delh. Now that BJP has won, it will make all arrangements to arrange funds in the budget, plug leakages and end corruption,"" he said.Other areas that will require immediate attention are the healthcare sector, where seven new hospitals and extensions of upgrades of another 17 that have already been sanctioned require Rs 10,200 crore, besides an annual budget of Rs 8,000 crore to operate these facilities, and Delhi Metro projects that need Rs 2,700 crore for completion of Phase III and expansion of Phase IV.And then, there are funds needed to contain air pollution, a perennial fight for Delhi, and to repair and re-carpet its roads, a sore point for Delhiites in recent years as the quality of public infrastructure visibly degraded. Delhi government's road infrastructure funding reduced from Rs 3,126 crore in 2023-24 to Rs 1,768 crore in 2024-25, with no additional underpasses or flyovers being proposed.","Bjp made several ambitious commitments to voters to outplay kejriwal on his pet social welfare pitch.

In a historic political shift, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is poised to form government in Delhi after 27 years, securing a commanding two-thirds majority in the assembly elections 2025. The BJP's resounding victory ends over a decade of governance by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), led by Arvind Kejriwal The last BJP government in Delhi served from 1993 to 1998, marking this win as a significant comeback for the party. Of the 70 assembly constituencies, the BJP clinched 48 seats, while AAP managed to secure only 22. This landslide victory saw several prominent AAP leaders, including Kejriwal, former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia , former minister Satyendra Jain , and Saurabh Bharadwaj, losing their constituencies.In a closely watched contest, Kejriwal lost the New Delhi assembly seat to BJP's Parvesh Verma by a margin of 4,089 votes. Meanwhile, Congress' score remained zero as the party failed to secure any seat.Here's are the winners and losers in the Delhi assembly elections 2025Yet again, he was BJP’s mascot, chief campaigner and the man who had to compensate for the local party unit’s lack of a formidable ﬁgure. That he led BJP to a big victory proves he remains a big vote-getter and a great motivator for party cadre. He adroitly wooed both lower-income groups and middle classes. His high-decibel campaign speeches against AAP’s ‘corruption’ framed BJP’s charge against AAP chief. The Delhi victory, coming on top of BJP’s Haryana and Maharashtra wins, has pretty much restored Brand Modi, which had taken a few knocks after Lok Sabha elections.So, that’s one more job off his 'to-do' list. Delhi had eluded Modi’s BJP since 2014 and Shah had strategised hard both in 2015 and 2020. He did it again this time, framing a broad strategy as well as ﬁxing the nuts and bolts. Getting the party cadre to believe that Kejriwal was beatable was not easy. But, helped by Modi’s aggressive dubbing of Aam Aadmi Party as ""AAP-da"" (disaster), he managed to turn the mood around. His decision to ﬁeld Pravesh Verma against Kejriwal was a master stroke typical of BJP’s no.2.Humble, accessible, ﬁercely honest, a new kind of politician who promises a new kind of politics. That was his image in 2013, when he burst onto the political scene. Now? Hubristic, yet another leader who allegedly uses govt for political funding, a politician who's lost touch with those who made him a success, seemingly uncaring that the city he governed became a byword for urban mismanagement. Kejriwal's rise to power and prominence was as spectacular as his fall from grace. That he — humiliatingly — couldn't even RETAIN the seat he's won three times since 2013 makes it even worse.His star rose with Kejriwal's. But he had an early intimation of trouble in the last assembly polls. He had just scraped through in Patparganj in 2020 and shifted to Jangpura this time. That made him look like he was running away. The defeat in Jangpura has dealt him a severe political blow. Like it's for Kejriwal, his successes — supposedly the brain behind AAP's transformation of govt schools in Delhi — are now a distant memory. Not a mass politician on his own, what happens to his political career depends entirely on whether Kejriwal can recover from this defeat.Daughter of academics and plucked out of obscurity by Kejriwal, she became a media star for AAP, followed by her appointment as an advisor to the then-deputy CM Sisodia. She was the SAFE choice for Kejriwal when he had to GIVE UP CMship after being sent to jail. No one took her seriously in that job, including many in AAP. She was CM for 135 days and could do nothing to change the perception of non-governance by AAP. Her win, after a big scare during counting, is of little consolation to either her or her party.For the Gandhis, nothing's worked since Congress turned in an impressive show in Lok Sabha elections. Delhi is the third election loss since LS, and 2025 is the third time Congress has scored a duck in the city. Brother and sister campaigned in the capital but made little difference to overall results. But, funnily, all’s not bad for the Gandhis. That Congress may have cost AAP votes and that AAP was beaten roundly is, ﬁrst, revenge for Congress and, second, a buffer against other regional satraps’ critiques. Had AAP won, TMC, SP would have come down hard on Gandhis and their party.","The bharatiya janata party (bjp) is poised to form government in delhi after 27 years.

Arvind Kejriwal 's Aam Aadmi Party suffered an embarrassing loss as most of its heavyweights lost the contest.The BJP secured a significant victory in Delhi, winning 48 seats in the 70-member assembly.AAP , which had dominated the previous two terms with a substantial majority, managed only 22 seats. The Congress party failed to secure any seats for the third straight time.The BJP and its NDA allies celebrated the Delhi win, attributing it to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership. The Congress, however, maintained that the results reflected a verdict on AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal rather than Modi's governance.The Congress defended its decision to contest against Aam Aadmi Party, criticising those who questioned their stance. They pointed out that similar concerns about opposition unity were not raised when AAP contested elections in Goa, Gujarat, Haryana and other states, potentially dividing the secular vote.The BJP, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi swept the Delhi assembly elections with a comfortable majority. This victory marks the third major electoral success for the BJP in the last four months after winning the states of Haryana and Maharashtra. With this, the 27 years exile of the BJP in Delhi also comes to an end. This major win also indicates approval by the middle class to Modi government’s big tax relief in the Union budget 2025 last week have got the approval of middle-class consumers.With this, PM Modi yet again proves to be the star campaigner for the BJP.In a high-stakes battle for New Delhi assembly seat, BJP leader Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant slayer by defeating former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal by 4,089 seats.Son of former CM Sahib Singh Verma, Parvesh was was entrusted to take on Kejriwal who has held in to the seat last three times. In 2013, Kejriwal had emerged as giant slayer by defeating then CM and Congress veteran Sheila Dixit.After dethroning the three-time CM, Verma is also in now a strong contender for the top post.BJP leader Tarvinder Singh Marwah emerged as another giant slayer as he defeated former deputy CM and AAP senior leader Manish Sisodia. Marwah defeated three-time MLA Sisodia to win Jangpura seat by 675 votes. Sisodia had switched seats from Patparganj to Jangpura this time hoping for a comfortable win.Marwah, who was in Congress for a long time and elected three-time MLA from Jangpura, had switched to BJP in 2022 after complaining of not getting time with Sonia and Rahul Gandhi for a meeting.Also read: Delhi election results: How the OGs of AAP became Kejriwal’s biggest critics over the decade As the heavyweights of Aam Aadmi Party fell one by one, Atishi stood tall and won the Kalkaji assembly seat. In a high-stakes contest, Atishi won by 3,521 votes defeating BJP's Ramesh Bidhuri and Congress's Alka Lamba.""I thank the people of Kalkaji for showing trust in me. I congratulate my team who worked against 'baahubal',"" Atishi said.""We accept the people's mandate. I have won but it's not a time to celebrate but continue the 'war' against the BJP,"" the 43-year-old said.Her victory is a standout for the AAP as its top leaders Arvind Kejriwal and former Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia lost their constituencies.With the defeat served to Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia, Atishi may now also take charge as the leader of opposition in Delhi assembly.The Congress leader may have lost the contest today but he surely has emerged as the 'Baazigar' of this poll season. Son of veteran Congress leader and three-time CM Sheila Dikshit, Sandeep got his ultimate revenge against Arvind Kejriwal today.Though he did not win the New Delhi seat, he managed to eat in to Kejriwal's votes that eventually led to the AAP chief's defeat.It was a matter of prestige for Sandeep, who was finally given a ticket from New Delhi, his mother's bastion, which had been the stronghold of Kejriwal since 2013.It's no surprise there. The one at the top of this list is AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal. The politician, who rose to power as a anti-graft crusader found himself embroiled in corruption cases.After walking out of jail on bail, Kejriwal resigned from the top post seeking validation from the public of Delhi. The union territory, however, refused to give the stamp of 'Mr Clean' to Kejriwal.The AAP suffered a major blow this election and now will have to look at ways to reinvent itself.The former deputy chief minister of Delhi and second-in-command of AAP, Sisodia, also faced defeat against BJP candidate Tarvinder Singh Marwah in the Jangpura constituency.Having previously served as a three-term MLA from Patparganj in east Delhi, he chose to contest from Jangpura in this election.Following his arrest in 2023 over alleged corruption in the liquor policy case, Sisodia was imprisoned for approximately 18 months until he secured bail. Similar to Kejriwal's stance, he declined to accept a governmental position prior to receiving the ""people's verdict"".Delhi, however, decided to give him another chance this time.After governing Delhi for a decade, AAP faced significant anti-incumbency and lost the election to BJP. This is the first time since its inception that AAP will not hold power in Delhi.With the Delhi loss, AAP is now in power only in Punjab. With this, the national expansion plan of the party has hit a roadblock.The party will now have to regroup and reorganise itself as it now sits in opposition in Delhi.The Congress party has recorded its third consecutive blank in the Delhi assembly elections, marking a stark contrast to its earlier dominance when it governed the capital for 15 consecutive years from 1998 to 2013.Delhi's electorate has consistently rejected the party in three successive assembly elections.After snapping alliance with AAP for Delhi elections , Congress mounted an assertive campaign with former party president Rahul Gandhi spearheading the criticism against Arvind Kejriwal.Despite these efforts, the party failed to secure any constituencies in Delhi. Their sole minor comfort lies in achieving a modest improvement in vote share, rising by approximately 2% from its previous figure of less than 5% in the 2020 assembly elections.Omar Abdullah’s X post captured the mood of INDIA bloc today -- 'Aur lado aapas mein'. The jibe came as AAP and Congress fought against each other which eventually benefitted BJP.With the bitter and ugly fight and AAP’s eventual loss in Delhi, the focus now turns to if it's an end to INDIA bloc.The AAP defeat also comes as an embarassment to Trinamool Congress and Samajwadi Party who actively campaigned for AAP in Delhi.While Congress may have not been able to open its account in Delhi once again, Rahul Gandhi cannot be put in the list of losers. Rahul, who personally took charge to dent Kejriwal's image during the election campaign, was successful in his mission.The defeat also limits AAP within the INDIA bloc who had the capability to challenge Congress' position as a national party. The Delhi blow also gives Congress a little immunity within the bloc where allies SP, TMC, Sena (UBT) chose Kejriwal's party over Congress.","The bjp secured a significant victory in delhi, winning 48 seats in the 70-member assembly.

Delhi elections: Four reserved seats shed reservations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-elections-four-reserved-seats-shed-reservations/articleshow/118077305.cms,"NEW DELHI: BJP has won the highest number of reserved seats since 1993, bagging 4 out of the 12 Scheduled Caste (SC) constituencies.The party, for the first time, has also won Mangolpuri, which is an SC seat.The SC seats are Gokalpur, Seemapuri, Mangolpuri, Sultanpur Majra, Bawana, Karol Bagh, Patel Nagar, Deoli, Ambedkar Nagar, Madipur, Kondli and Trilokpuri.The BJP's win in four - Bawana, Mangolpuri, Madipur and Seemapuri - marks a significant shift from the past two elections when it had failed to win a single one. AAP, which had dominated SC constituencies in 2015 and 2020 - it won all 12 seats - has seen a decline, securing eight this time.""AAP made a concerted effort to connect with communities such as Balmikis, but it was more symbolic and never substantive. Since Mayawati is no longer a force, it became a pragmatic choice for SCs to shift to BJP. Their vote has also been divided in multiple directions. Anti-incumbency after 10 years also played a role, and there was no clear distinction in the freebies promised by BJP and AAP,"" said former AAP member Anand Kumar.BJP's improved performance comes amid a controversy over the party's handling of BR Ambedkar's legacy. Allegations that BJP had undermined Ambedkar's contribution and policies led to protests by Dalit groups and opposition parties. BJP countered the claims by highlighting Dalit welfare initiatives. The party intensified its campaign in SC-dominated areas.In Mangolpuri, winner Rajkumar Chauhan of BJP said that ""AAP failed to do any work here in the last 11 years, while people remembered the development in the area when I was the MLA. I also maintained a relationship with the electorate."" Chauhan, who defeated AAP's Rakesh Jatav, joined BJP last year.

NEW DELHI: BJP scored a spectacular victory in all parliamentary constituency areas to win 48 of the 70 assembly seats in the capital. In particular, it was the party's performance in outer Delhi, areas bordering Haryana, that helped it rout AAP and storm back to power after 27 years. AAP, for its part, continued its impressive run in Muslim- and Dalit-dominated seats apart from winning isolated pockets with a higher number of JJ clusters and unauthorised colonies.BJP triumphed in nine of the 10 seats in the West Delhi parliamentary constituency, eight each in North West Delhi and East Delhi and seven in New Delhi.The remaining seats came from Chandni Chowk, where six of its candidates emerged victorious, and five each in South Delhi and North East Delhi.In the 2020 assembly polls, when BJP tallied just eight seats, the party had failed to win a single seat in New Delhi, West Delhi, South Delhi and Chandni Chowk. While one BJP candidate was elected from North West Delhi, three each returned from East Delhi and North East Delhi.BJP, thus, not only made inroads in urban pockets of central Delhi and New Delhi this time, but also almost swept the outer Delhi areas and rural parts of the city. ""Of the 13 seats that share a border with Uttar Pradesh, we got seven while of the 11 constituencies on the border with Haryana, we won nine,"" smiled a BJP functionary.Narela, Mundka, Badli, Najafgarh, Palam, Bijwasan, Matiala, Chhatarpur and Mehrauli were some of the prominent rural seats where BJP had failed to do anything impressive in the last two elections but where it performed extremely well this year. Surender Solanki, chief of Palam 360 Khap, said the rural voters came out in large numbers to support BJP. ""The villages, be it rural or urban, were completely ignored by Delhi govt. We ran a campaign, visited every single city village, interacted with the residents and prepared a list of demands. We approached all political parties. While AAP continued to ignore us, the PM called us as did the Union home minister and assured us our issues will be addressed. The Khap, accordingly, supported BJP,"" said Solanki.The Khap chief added that BJP managed to wrest several seats with the support of the villagers from AAP, which itself had grabbed them from Congress in 2013.AAP held on to its support base in reserved constituencies. While the party had won all 12 SC seats in 2015 and 2020, it retained eight seats this time. Similarly, people came out in large numbers in constituencies dotted with unauthorised colonies in its support. Gokalpur, Ambedkar Nagar, Kondli, Okhla, Badarpur, Tughlaqabad, Deoli, Kirari, Burari and Sultanpur Majra are known for having large clusters of unauthorised colonies.An AAP functionary explained why. ""In our campaign, we highlighted the work done by our govt to improve the amenities in the city's 1,797 unauthorised colonies. We connected these colonies with sewer and water pipelines, laid down roads, built drains and improved overall living conditions. The support we got from the residents of some of such colonies is a validation of our work.""While the Muslim vote showed signs of division in a couple of constituencies, it largely went in the favour of AAP, getting big victories for its candidates. Except Mustafabad, where the Hindu votes consolidated against a trifurcation of Muslims votes, AAP won comprehensively in Okhla, Seelampur, Matia Mahal and Ballimaran. It also performed reasonably well in areas where Muslims live in large numbers but are not the deciding force, such as at Kirari and Seemapuri.Despite being the partners in the INDIA bloc, a grouping of opposition parties at the national level, AAP and Congress contested the assembly election separately. This was to BJP's advantage. According to an analysis, there are 14 seats that BJP won because Congress garnered more votes than the margin between the winner and the closest rival. These seats are Timarpur, Badli, Nangloi Jat, Madipur, Rajendra Nagar, New Delhi, Jangpura, Kasturba Nagar, Malviya Nagar, Mehrauli, Chhatarpur, Sangam Vihar, Greater Kailash and Trilokpuri.Some political observers believed that had Congress and AAP contested the election as alliance partners, the results could have been different. Although the vote cutting by Congress was evident in its candidates saving their security deposits only in Kasturba Nagar, Badli and Nangloi Jat, a Congress functionary refused to accept the theory. ""We contested the Lok Sabha election jointly and the result was we failed to win a single seat. Theoretically, one can say that the alliance could have prevented the BJP juggernaut, but the results could have been totally different too,"" the Congress member argued.","Bjp scored a spectacular victory in all parliamentary constituency areas to win 48 of the 70 assembly seats in the capital.

NEW DELHI: After BJP's emphatic win, the spotlight has turned to the all-important question of who is going to be the next chief minister.While many names, including those of party MPs from Delhi, were doing the rounds, there were indications that the party brass may pick someone from among the winning MLAs to avoid two byelections - one caused by the resignation of an Lok Sabha MP and another that would be necessitated if a sitting MLA is persuaded to quit his seat.Among the crowded field of contenders, Parvesh Verma has pulled ahead after his giant-killing victory over Kejriwal in the latter's stronghold of New Delhi. Son of former CM Saheb Singh Verma, Parvesh, who twice won the West Delhi Lok Sabha seat, is seen as a good Jat face and can help deepen the connect with the community, which appears to have supported BJP.Vijender Gupta, leader of BJP in the outgoing assembly, is also seen as a strong contender. He scored his third consecutive victory from Rohini.""It is too premature,"" a party source said. ""The leadership is not going to be rushed into a decision and, in all likelihood, it will be taken after PM Modi's return from the US on Friday.""BJP is known to spring surprises in state appointments, often opting for low-profile figures to bring an element of control and freshness.

Though he didn't lose from this constituency, the people here - who once propelled him to political stardom - spoke of his downfall as if it were their own reckoning. This was, after all, where his political journey took root, the karambhoomi where his hunger strike against corruption and taxation in 2013 first captured national attention.But amid the post-mortem of his political loss , another name surfaced just as often - Santosh Kohli.Kohli's story remains a painful chapter in Sunder Nagri's history. The social activist, whose mother played a crucial role in helping Kejriwal establish his Parivartan NGO, was tragically killed in a hit-and-run incident in 2013. ""In this very house, Kejriwal staged his hunger strike. Now my daughter's picture still hangs on these walls. She introduced him to the very people he championed. But when she was taken from us, he turned his back,"" her mother Kalavati told TOI.Today, that very house - once the birthplace of Kejriwal's political career - now wears the colours of the BJP, a stark reminder of shifting tides. Kalavati, now 64, is resolute in her support for the saffron party. ""Not just us, but many former AAP loyalists feel betrayed. I have worked in the social sector for years, and I understand the struggles of my people. And now, almost everyone here supports the BJP-his biggest rival.""For some, his defeat is seen as poetic justice. ""He ignored Kohli's family when they needed him the most. Now, he is facing the consequences of his karma."" Others attribute his loss to his alleged involvement in the liquor scam. ""We once supported him because he stood against corruption. But then his name started surfacing in scandals. It feels like he has come full circle - his rise was built on fighting corruption, and now, corruption has led to his downfall,"" said Vinod Kumar Jain (50).As one wades through the weekly market crowd, the disenchantment is clear. ""What has he truly done for us? I wouldn't mind paying my bills if it meant we had safer roads, cleaner water, and proper sewage systems. But the worst part is how he abandoned the very people who once treated him like family. He didn't even visit after Santosh Kohli's death,"" said a frustrated resident.""We thought he would change the system, but in the end, he became just another politician,"" said another voter.Yet, some still stand by Aam Aadmi Party . ""We are grateful for free water, electricity, and better schools. That's why we continue to vote for AAP. We are sad he lost, but he will always be one of our own,"" admitted one voter.However, in Sunder Nagri's Muslim-majority pockets, Kejriwal's continued support comes with resignation rather than enthusiasm. ""We vote for AAP because we don't have better options. We can't afford to lose subsidies. We don't know how we will pay our bills now,"" said Mehfooz Khan, 52.Kejriwal's absence from Sunder Nagri in recent years has not gone unnoticed. ""Karmbhoomi nahi, karma-chhuti (Not a workplace, but a holiday),"" remarked RK Swamy, 44, emphasising how Kejriwal's detachment has cost him dearly.","In sunder nagri, kejriwal's political journey took root in the karambhoomi where his hunger strike against corruption and taxation in 2013 first captured national attention.

Its campaign focusing on the house might have emerged as a factor behind Kejriwal's and AAP's electoral loss. ""No BJP chief minister will occupy the 'Sheeshmahal'.

This was done after Kejriwal vacated the accommodation following his resignation from the post of chief minister last year.The list of extravagant interiors found during the audit made its way into the media. This was then used by both BJP and Congress as a campaign point.BJP even made small replicas of the residence and mounted them on vans, which moved across the city as part of its election campaign.In 2022, the vigilance department initiated an inquiry on the direction of LG VK Saxena into ""irregularities and cost escalation in renovation of the house"" by PWD.Then in 2024, an inquiry was initiated against the PWD officials involved, and some faced suspension.

However, the results from Delhi tell a different story. BJP, under Modi's leadership, has not only won but has done so decisively, clinching 48 out of 70.Modi's campaign strategy in Delhi was multi-faceted, focusing on development, governance and a personal connection with the electorate. Unlike previous elections where regional leaders often took precedence, Modi himself became BJP's mascot for these polls.His rallies were not just about national achievements such as the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya or the abrogation of Article 370 but also addressed Delhi-specific issues like pollution, infrastructure gaps and the cleaning of Yamuna.This victory underscores Modi's ability to translate his national narrative into local victories, blending his overarching vision for India with the immediate needs of Delhi's residents. His speeches, particularly the one at the BJP headquarters post-victory, emphasised building Delhi as a ""modern city"" with a focus on urban infrastructure, mobility and heritage preservation, resonating with the urban voter's aspirations.The political narrative around Modi's electoral ""invincibility"" has been a subject of debate.In the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP under Modi swept all seven seats in Delhi, reinforcing his image as a national leader with strong voter appeal. However, the Delhi assembly elections of 2015 and 2020 saw AAP under Arvind Kejriwal clinch victories, fuelling the narrative that Modi's influence might not extend to regional politics. Saturday's result challenges that notion, showing that Modi's personal guarantees and BJP's campaign strategy can indeed sway voters at both levels.Moreover, this victory comes at a time when BJP's national popularity had shown signs of plateauing after the 2024 general elections, where it fell short of an outright majority.The Delhi win, coming close on the heels of Haryana and Maharashtra, is seen as a rejuvenation of Modi's political aura, proving that his leadership can still sway voters in regional contests.BJP's strategy also involved highlighting governance failures of AAP, especially when it came to allegations of corruption against its leaders, which played a significant role in swaying public opinion. Modi's promise to make Delhi a part of the 'Viksit Bharat' vision, aligning local governance with national development goals, was well-received.The Delhi outcome not only dispels the myth about Modi's limited regional appeal but also sets a precedent for how national leaders can engage with state politics. It's a testament to Modi's strategy of personal engagement, leveraging national success stories, and addressing local issues, making him a formidable","Pm narendra modi has once again proved that he can pull out big wins, this time by leading bjp to a historic victory in the delhi assembly elections.

Delhi's is among the smallest of many elections held in the world's largest democracy - but on Saturday, the national capital sent out some massive national political messages.First, BJP's post-Lok Sabha elections loss of lustre is now a firmly closed chapter. Modi is back again as a political super-force and the most saleable political brand.Second, following from the first, Rahul Gandhi is back to looking like he used to before Congress won 99 seats in Lok Sabha polls.Nothing he does or says seems to matter when it comes to elections.Third, Arvind Kejriwal's status as a big national opposition player has, for now at least, been severely diminished. Seldom has a political brand taken as big a hit as his took after the Delhi results.Fourth, the opposition alliance is now in tatters.Fifth, at least in urban areas, freebies alone can't win elections, as became clear via Delhi voters punishing AAP for bad infrastructure.In Delhi, there was a sense of one era ending and another beginning in the city. BJP returned to office after 27 years, and AAP was voted out after a decade. Kejriwal will not return as Delhi CM, nor will Atishi. All eyes are on who Modi-Shah pick as BJP's CM.The last time BJP was voted to office in Delhi, in 1993, Yamuna still had aquatic life, Appu Ghar was the biggest city attraction, Delhi Metro looked like a distant dream, and city air wasn't toxic. A city that has changed so radically, for good and bad, gave a verdict that was equally dramatic.The sense of stunning change was heightened by Kejriwal losing the New Delhi seat. His 4,089-vote loss to Parvesh Verma, ex-BJP CM Sahib Singh Verma's son, in a seat he'd won by 21,000-plus votes in 2020, capped an awful day for AAP's brass.How Delhi apportioned its votes was an interesting story by itself. BJP’s 48-seat haul in the 70-seat assembly came on the back of a 45.6% vote share. AAP’s 22-seat tally, less than half of BJP’s, was coupled with a substantial 43.6% vote share.That a 2-percentage point difference in vote share could change fortunes so comprehensively said five things.First, this is the first time ever that a party with a 40%-plus vote share in Delhi has lost elections. Second, the 10-percentage point fall in AAP’s vote share between 2020 and 2025 didn’t erode its low-income voter base substantially.Therefore, third, middle class Delhi voters swung against the party and made a pivotal difference to the results.Fourth, middle class anger against AAP was centred around the party’s seemingly uncaring attitude towards city infrastructure, an anger AAP either missed or downplayed.Fifth, at the margins, that AAP and Congress fought separately and waged a bitter campaign against each other, made some crucial difference to the overall outcome.Breaking up the verdict by Delhi sub-regions shows just how far-reaching BJP’s victory is. Its wins largely came from the outer Delhi areas bordering Haryana in north and west, and from New Delhi and East Delhi. BJP won nine of 10 seats in the West Delhi parliamentary constituency area, eight each in North West Delhi and East Delhi, and seven in New Delhi. In the 2020 polls, BJP had failed to win a single seat in West Delhi and New Delhi, while it had emerged victorious in one seat in North West Delhi. It also won six seats in Chandni Chowk Lok Sabha area, where it had no legislators in the last term.Plus, BJP also managed to make inroads in Dalit-dominated areas, winning four of the 12 reserved SC constituencies. Capping all this was the party wresting the Muslim-dominated seat of Mustafabad, where it benefitted from a four-cornered fight.","Bjp's post-lok sabha loss of lustre is now a firmly closed chapter.

NEW DELHI: With AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal and his former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia losing their seats, the party faces its biggest challenge ever as it will now have to step into the role of an opposition for the first time in the face of a raging BJP that has come to office with a comfortable 48 seats.Not just Kejriwal and Sisodia, most of AAP's senior leadership didn't make it to the assembly except for outgoing CM Atishi and AAP Delhi convener Gopal Rai , who also held the environment portfolio.Among the party biggies who bit the dust was the outgoing health and urban development minister, Saurabh Bharadwaj , who lost the Greater Kailash seat that he had held since 2013. Bharadwaj was not just an important minister but also a forceful party spokesperson.Other prominent losers were former AAP health minister Satyendar Jain, who is out on bail, and deputy speaker Rakhi Birla.In the last AAP cabinet, however, four of the six members managed to win their seats. Apart from Atishi and Rai, the other two winners were food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain from Ballimaran and labour minister Mukesh Kumar Ahlawat from Sultanpur Majra. Among the losers was minister without portfolio Raghuvender Shokeen from Nangloi Jat.When AAP was born out of the India Against Corruption movement in 2012, Kejriwal and Sisodia were seen as the pillars holding up the new outfit that entered the poll fray against the formidable three-time CM Sheila Dikshit. The subsequent rise of AAP saw the party fast become a one-man show with Kejriwal, supported by Sisodia, seen to be setting the agenda and the governance roadmap from the party's first stint of 49 days, when it formed a minority govt with outside support from Congress in 2013. Even in the toughest times, when the party was under attack over the liquor scam - Kejriwal and Sisodia remained firmly together and joined forces in the poll campaign for the Delhi elections after they got bail.Even the exit of some senior AAP leaders, including those who had served as ministers, could only rock the boat but not destabilise it. Kejriwal was seen to be helming the narrative as the CM even when he was in jail.Kejriwal later resigned and decided to hand the baton to Atishi upon his release from jail in September last year. Yet, despite the strong messaging that Atishi was in command of the govt, it was the AAP national convener who was leading the show. He had said that would take on the role of CM only if AAP won the Delhi polls as a ""certificate of honesty"" from the people.Now, with AAP having lost and Kejriwal no longer an MLA, AAP faces the challenge of nurturing a strong second line of leadership to lead the opposition charge and take on the BJP in the assembly. Only the days ahead will show how Kejriwal is able to keep his flock together now that they are out of power.While both Atishi and Rai are trusted aides, which of the two will be chosen for the tough task of leader of opposition is something that will be carefully considered.Atishi played a pivotal role in assisting Manish Sisodia in preparing the roadmap for strengthening the school infrastructure when he was education minister and then stepped in as a trusted minister before taking on the role of CM. Rai, besides being a minister, has been managing the organisation as the Delhi convener. Whoever is assigned the role of leader of opposition will face the challenge of keeping the MLAs together as AAP is now vulnerable to MLAs being poached and fissures emerging within the party over leadership issues.Satyendar Jain, who lost from Shakur Basti, was one of the first ministers to be arrested. Jain was instrumental in steering flagship schemes like mohalla clinics. Like other party stalwarts, Jain had retained his seat since 2013.Somnath Bharti is another prominent AAP figure who fell by the wayside, losing from Malviya Nagar to former Delhi BJP president Satish Upadhyay.AAP's MCD in-charge Durgesh Pathak who contested from Rajendra Nagar assembly seat also lost by a narrow margin of 1,231 votes to BJP's Umang Bajaj. Pathak is also currently the member of the party's political affairs committee.","After poll loss, aap needs to find second line of leadership.

Poll How Do You View the Delhi Election Results? A Reflection of Voter Sentiment A Major Political Shift

The Delhi election results , which have brought BJP back to government after 27 years, can be summed up in one line: the aam aadmi voted against the leadership of Aam Aadmi Party , but not necessarily against the idea of AAP. There can be no other explanation when many top leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, who made this election a referendum on himself, lost their seats - but the drop in AAP's seat count was not mirrored in a commensurate drop in vote share, which came within a stone's throw of BJP's.BJP proved that an elephant can dance. It was nimble enough to finetune strategy to make the Delhi election both local and national. Congress, in order to keep its own political future safe from intruders, marginally helped by making the defeat of Kejriwal a higher priority than defeating BJP.If there is one thing politicians can learn from the AAP debacle, it is to eschew hubris and over-ambition. BJP got a taste of the blowback from cockiness in Lok Sabha elections, but it wasn't a crippling blow. Now Kejriwal has faced a full electoral backlash and is out of government in Delhi, his launchpad to national fame.Kejriwal lost for two major reasons apart from hubris. One, thanks to the liquor scandal and the spending of large sums on his official residence, the electorate saw that the man they voted for (a pro-poor, anti-corruption crusader) may not be who he claimed to be. It's no crime for a CM to have a reasonably well-equipped residence, but it went against Kejriwal's well-cultivated image of living the life of aam aadmi. He made things worse for himself by, among other things, making wild allegations about Haryana trying to poison Delhi's waters. No voter likes to see his future CM sounding a bit unhinged.BJP, for its part, sought to consolidate the middle-class vote - Delhi is India's predominant middle-class city - without losing other segments. The budget's tax sops helped.Delhi has two attributes that contribute to political hubris. As the national capital, anyone who runs it gets national attention. Secondly, as a city-state with high revenues but only some of the costs of running a state, it gives you the freedom to use these resources to offer endless freebies to get yourself elected. Unlike regular states, Delhi doesn't have to pay for policing and pensions, two very big expenditure areas for most states.Kejriwal misused these advantages. He used the revenue surpluses (now largely gone) for freebies and self-promotion, spending hundreds of crores to build his image in other states, by issuing front-page print and primetime television ads. Why does a man running a prosperous city-state need to spend its taxpayers' money elsewhere?Hubris began immediately after the thumping 2015 assembly victory, where his party won 67 of Delhi's 70 seats. Kejriwal began to see himself as a potential PM and used Delhi's resources to project himself in that light. In Delhi, he held no portfolios, leaving the actual job of running his administration to Manish Sisodia and other ministerial colleagues. Clearly, his focus was less on doing a mayoral job in Delhi, and more on his next move up the national political ladder.For someone without Kejriwal's over-ambition, Delhi's high revenues could have been used for really improving the state of primary and secondary education and basic healthcare. And, initially, this was indeed his party's focus and some real change appears to have begun in these areas. But it wasn't carried through to becoming a viable model fit for replication elsewhere. The Kejriwal model didn't prove useful to anyone, except to make free power and water the basic poll prepayment required for any party to win an election. These questionable ideas were used to win the Punjab assembly election, but that state does not have the resources to sustain such freebies endlessly and is now deep in debt.Kejriwal also played his politics poorly, losing allies along the way. He saw himself as the national alternative to BJP and Modi, when this could have been possible only at the expense of Congress, which governs much larger states than Delhi. This contributed to his election loss, as Congress realised that AAP was a threat to its national stature and sought to undercut it.The Delhi defeat should bring Kejriwal down to earth. If he really introspects, he will emerge a much better politician. He should first do the hard job of making his policies and potential known beyond Delhi without using freebies as his only calling card. He has the political savvy to bounce back but only if he abandons hubris. Contrary to his own assumptions, he is not - yet - God's gift to India. AAP still has brand salience but he squandered it this time.For BJP, the test of good governance begins now. If any state could do with a double-engine sarkar, it's the half-state of Delhi.","The delhi election results can be summed up in one line: the aam aadmi voted against the leadership of aam aadmi party.

BJP-AAP vote share gap is quite small. So, what swung the election decisively in BJP’s favour? Some short takes:

Saffron's long march

Taking the middle out



‘Fakes’ among freebies

Brand Kejriwal loses sheen



Modi hai toh…

NEW DELHI: The national capital on Saturday witnessed a saffron tsunami with the BJP securing a resounding victory in all parliamentary constituency areas, winning 48 out of 70 assembly seats.Aam Aadmi Party, however, maintained a stronghold in Muslim- and Dalit-dominated constituencies.What seemed to have worked in favour of the BJP was the, middle class andfactor (excise policy case), along with the ""sheeshmahal"" attack on AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal during the poll campaign.What seemed to not have worked in AAP's favour were issues like poor roads, traffic congestion, Yamuna pollution, and poor air quality.BJP’s campaign for Delhi started much before polls were announced. Every bad headline against AAP was followed by a sustained BJP campaign, hurting the incumbent. Closer to elections, ‘sheesh mahal’, as BJP cleverly named the generously refurbished CM residence, hurt AAP’s image even more.Also Read: 'Hold BJP accountable for poll promises': Kejriwal's directive to Delhi AAP MLAs After initially criticising AAP’s freebie game, BJP, too, made populist promises with gusto. BJP also talked up the idea of a double-engine sarkar, even as perceptions of govt dysfunctionality took hold, in part thanks to the LG-AAP fight. By the time polls were held, many voters had bought BJP’s argumentVote-share stats make it clear AAP has lost little of its core low-income vote. BJP would have always strategised with that assumption — and therefore it targeted Delhi’s neo-middle class and middle class, who were more upset with the state of roads, traffic, Yamuna, and air pollution than they were impressed by free water, power and primary health care.To that, BJP added the announcement of the 8th Pay Commission — Delhi voters include many govt employees and their families — and the Budget’s income tax cuts.BJP campaigned hard against some elements of AAP’s welfare policy regime. ‘Fake medicines’ and ‘ghost patients’ in free mohalla clinics was one such campaign. AAP contested these claims hotly.Also Read: Delhi loss may trigger churning in AAP's Punjab den But some of those charges stuck when coupled with demonstrable failures like Yamuna ﬂowing as dirty as ever and desperate AAP claims like Haryana’s BJP govt ‘poisoning’ Yamuna water.That AAP suffered big losses in seats along the Haryana border tells this story powerfully.Kejriwal started as a ‘humble man of the people’ who didn’t want to stay in govt bungalows. But he came into these polls as a very different leader. He and his colleagues didn’t recognise that aside from anti-incumbency against AAP, there was anti-incumbency against Kejriwal himself.When things turned against AAP, Modi’s appeal, dormant in the last two assembly polls, came to the fore. He was front and centre in BJP’s campaign and his sharp attacks and promises of smooth coordination between the Centre and Delhi made an appreciable difference","Bjp secured a resounding victory in all parliamentary constituency areas, winning 48 out of 70 assembly seats.
