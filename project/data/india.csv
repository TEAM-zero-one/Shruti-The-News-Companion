'Working to spread hatred against Muslims': Owaisi slams Assam CM’s ‘point-blank shot’ video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/working-to-spread-hatred-against-muslims-owaisi-slams-assam-cms-point-blank-shot-video/articleshow/128096040.cms,"NEW DELHI: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen ( AIMIM ) chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Sunday launched a broadside against Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma over a video posted by the BJP showing Sarma taking a “point-blank shot” at two individuals identified as minorities.During a rally at Telangana's Zaheerabad, Owaisi accused the Assam chief minister of spreading hate against the Muslim community and added that the AIMIM would soon lodge a police complaint over the video.“If you think that communalism has ended, remember, no matter who comes to power, the poison of communalism persists. And the remedy, the antidote for the poison of communalism, is that you make the representatives of the Majlis successful. You see that in the country, the chief minister of Assam makes a video where he has a gun in his hand. And he fires a bullet. The bullet hits a person wearing a beard and a cap,” Owaisi said.“Tell me, he is the chief minister of Assam from the BJP. He posts a video from the BJP's social media. Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen strongly condemns that video. And Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, God willing, will also file a complaint with the police against it, so that a case can be registered against the chief minister of Assam.They are working to spread religious hatred against Muslims,” he added.Also read | 'I want to give you Rs 2 in alms': Owaisi hits out at Himanta Sarma over 'trouble Miya Muslims' remark This comes after the BJP Assam unit posted a video on X showing Sarma purportedly aiming a rifle at two people, one wearing a skull cap and another with a beard. The video was deleted after receiving backlash.Earlier, Owaisi had slammed Sarma over his controversial remarks on “troubling Miya Muslims”, calling them unconstitutional and divisive.Owaisi mocked the chief minister, saying, “I want to give you Rs 2 as alms,” and accused him of reducing constitutional governance to prejudice and intimidation. In a lengthy response, Owaisi said India’s Constitution guarantees equality and non-discrimination, regardless of religion or community.“The Constitution says all are equal. No discrimination should be done, whether it is a chief minister or anyone else,” he said.Owaisi alleged that Bengali-speaking Muslims in Assam were being scapegoated for issues ranging from migration to rising prices.“If vegetable prices increase in Assam, Miya Muslims are blamed. If someone wants to vote, they are told to go to Bangladesh,” he said, adding that such rhetoric amounted to targeting a community for political gain.The AIMIM leader's remarks came after Sarma made statements encouraging action against “Miya Muslims” in Assam.Sarma said, “Trouble the Miya Muslims by any means. If they face trouble, they will go from Assam... We are directly against the Miya Muslims. We are not hiding anything.”The comments triggered a political storm in the election-bound northeastern state, with opposition parties accusing the BJP of resorting to communal polarisation to consolidate votes.The BJP, however, has long maintained that its focus in Assam is on addressing illegal immigration and protecting indigenous rights. Bengali-speaking Muslims have frequently been labelled “illegal infiltrators” in political discourse, an issue that has remained central to Assam’s electoral politics.",All india majlis-e-ittehadul muslimeen ( aimim ) chief asaduddin owaisi launched a broadside against assam chief minister himanta biswa sarma over a video.

NEET-PG cut-off: Single-digit scores land PG seats in top med colleges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neet-pg-cut-off-single-digit-scores-land-pg-seats-in-top-med-colleges/articleshow/128086922.cms,"Removing cut-offs altogether risks patient safety , says doc



NEW DELHI: A steep cut in NEET-PG qualifying standards has led to postgraduate medical seats in govt colleges being filled at shockingly low scores - including in high-risk clinical specialties - triggering alarm across the medical fraternity, reports Anuja Jaiswal.The impact was stark in third-round PG counselling, where candidates secured seats in govt medical colleges with scores ranging from single digits to double digits, spanning both clinical and non-clinical disciplines. Even premier institutions and core clinical branches saw seats being allotted to candidates with such scores.An MS orthopaedics seat at a govt institute in Rohtak was allotted to a candidate with just 4 marks out of 800, while obstetrics and gynaecology at a premier Delhi medical college went to a candidate who scored 44 marks. A general surgery seat was filled at 47 marks.This signals a serious breakdown in medical education and workforce planning,” said a senior faculty member at a govt medical college. “Orthopaedics has traditionally been among the most demanding surgical specialties. Filling it at near-zero scores is a sign not of weaker students but a system under severe strain.”This happened following the sharp lowering of NEET-PG qualifying standards by Union health ministry for the 2025–26 academic session, with drastically reduced cut-offs across categories allowing candidates with extremely low — and even negative — scores to qualify.The effect was visible across disciplines. Seats were filled at 10 marks in transfusion medicine, 11 marks in anatomy, and minus 8 marks in biochemistry, many under reserved and PwD categories. While the revised cut-offs ensured that seats did not remain vacant, doctors warn the policy risks trading competence for convenience.“Allowing surgical and clinical branches to be filled at zero or near-zero percentile represents a serious erosion of standards,” said a senior doctor at a govt medical college. “Marks as low as 4, 11, 44 or 47 out of 800 point to a lack of basic aptitude. Removing cut-offs altogether directly risks patient safety.”The current policy marks a sharp shift from govt’s earlier stand. In July 2022, opposing a plea to lower NEET-PG cut-offs in Delhi HC, Centre had argued that minimum qualifying percentiles were essential to maintain education standards. The court agreed, warning that lowering medical education standards could “wreak havoc on society”, as medicine involved matters of life and death.Defending the present framework, a senior health ministry official said PG seats are allotted strictly under revised eligibility rules, and competence is intended to be ensured through training and exit exams, not entry cut-offs alone. Colleges are certified by regulators and are responsible for failing unsuitable candidates, the official said.Medical educators, however, say the trend reflects deeper structural problems — rapid seat expansion without a matching rise in trained faculty, overcrowded classrooms and eroding bedside skills. “Without strong faculty, robust exit exams and a system to weed out unsuitable candidates, anyone who enters medicine eventually gets a degree,” said a senior academician.Faculty members say the consequences are already visible. Many postgraduate students arrive without strong theoretical foundations, clinical skills or discipline. Pressure to pass students, weak exit mechanisms and over-reliance on online learning have further diluted training quality.“Easy entry has reduced seriousness even at top institutions,” said another doctor on condition of anonymity. “Numbers are rising, but training quality is falling — and that poses long-term risks to patient care.”Doctors caution that the branch of medicine does not reveal its failures immediately. Gaps in training today may surface years later, when these doctors practise independently — with serious implications for patient safety and public trust in the healthcare system.","A steep cut in neet-pg qualifying standards has led to postgraduate medical seats in govt colleges being filled at shockingly low scores.

Isro study shows safe patch near Moon’s Mons Mouton for Chandrayaan-4 landing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-study-shows-safe-patch-near-moons-mons-mouton-for-chandrayaan-4-landing/articleshow/128085691.cms,"ISRO Launches Heaviest-Ever Satellite BlueBird Block-2 Onboard LVM3 Rocket

BENGALURU: Scientists from Isro ’s Space Applications Centre (SAC) have identified a promising landing zone in the rugged south polar region of the Moon for India’s first lunar sample return mission, Chandrayaan-4.A detailed terrain study using images from the Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter High Resolution Camera (OHRC) has shortlisted a one-square-kilometre patch near Mons Mouton as the safest option for touchdown. The study, carried out by Amitabh, K Suresh, Ajay K Prashar, Kannan V Iyer, Abdul S, Shweta Verma Trivedi and Nitant Dube, has been accessed by TOI.Chandrayaan-4 will be Isro’s most complex lunar mission. The spacecraft will include a propulsion module, a descender module, an ascender module, a transfer module and a re-entry module. The descender and ascender stack must soft-land on the Moon, collect samples and launch them back to lunar orbit for return to Earth .Selecting the right site is crucial. Engineers must ensure gentle local slopes, adequate sunlight for at least 11-12 days, clear radio visibility to Earth, and minimal hazards such as craters and boulders. The lander design limits the acceptable slope to about 10° and requires boulders smaller than 0.32 metres .Earlier assessments based on coarser data had highlighted several candidate areas between 84° and 90° south latitude. The new work focused on five zones around Mons Mouton, analysing them with sharper OHRC stereo images at 32-centimetre resolution. One site was discarded because it lay in permanent shadow .Researchers generated digital elevation models at a fine grid of 0.32 metres and studied terrain undulations, illumination patterns and hazard distribution. Four locations, labelled MM-1, MM-3, MM-4 and MM-5, were compared on parameters such as mean slope, height range and the number of safe landing grids of 24 by 24 metres .Among them, the MM-4 area — at latitude minus 84.289° and longitude 32.808° — emerged as the front-runner. It showed the lowest hazard level at 9.89%, an average slope of 5° and the highest count of 568 safe grids. The region also offered favourable illumination and limited shadowing from nearby terrain .Other sites carried higher risks. MM-1 and MM-3 recorded hazard levels above 12%, while MM-5 provided only 72 safe grids within the target area. Elevations across the sites ranged from 4,800 to over 6,100 metres, reflecting the broken topography of the lunar south pole .Scientists say the analysis demonstrates how high-resolution imaging can guide precise landing decisions. The OHRC data allowed them to map craters, boulders and slopes with a clarity not available during earlier missions .If approved by the landing site selection committee, the MM-4 patch will host India’s first attempt to bring back pieces of the Moon. Success would place Isro among a small group of space agencies capable of returning extraterrestrial samples, opening a new chapter in the country’s planetary exploration programme.","A detailed terrain study using images from the chandrayaan-2 orbiter high resolution camera (ohrc) has shortlisted a one-square-kilometre patch near mons mouton as the safest option for touchdown.

PM Modi sets May deadline to prioritise quality improvement of highways,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-sets-may-deadline-to-prioritise-quality-improvement-of-highways/articleshow/128085143.cms,"NEW DELHI: Concerned over numerous complaints about poor quality highways in recent months, particularly during and after monsoon, PM Narendra Modi has set a May deadline for the road transport ministry to prioritise quality improvement and develop robust SOPs to ensure accountability and consistency.TOI has learnt that while recently reviewing progress in the highway sector, Modi also asked the ministry to crack down on poorly performing and litigating contractors, a move aimed at sending a strong message to errant builders.This comes amid poor construction by contractors, along with inadequate supervision by consultants and govt engineers, contributing to decline in quality of projects. In a series of instructions, the PM asked the ministry to devise a mechanism to ensure that blacklisted contractors are barred from participating in fresh bids, even indirectly. Also, contractors with a record of frequently invoking arbitrations would get lower ratings.Taking note of the possibility of collusion between contractors and farmers, the ministry has been asked to conduct a detailed study of this pattern, of delays in land acquisitions, and take necessary corrective measures.The PM has also instructed the ministry to study constraints preventing high-speed corridors from operating at the desired speed of 70 kmph. Norms are being revised to mandate prior approval from authorities before involving any subcontractors in new projects. The ministry has also been asked to stop the practice of converting state highways into national highways.The move is significant given that the current govt has expanded the NH network from about 91,300 km to 1.46 lakh km , a 60% increase.","Pm narendra modi has set a may deadline for the road transport ministry to prioritise quality improvement.

Why they need each other in 2026

BJP's compulsion

EPS’s doubts about the BJP

Eyeing an entry in Tamil Nadu

A 'natural alliance'

Caste arithmetic

What next?

NEW DELHI: Once upon a time, the Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK pulled the plug on a vulnerable Atal Bihari Vajpayee government at the Centre. The withdrawal of support in 1999 triggered the NDA's collapse after a no-confidence motion, forcing midterm Lok Sabha elections. For the BJP, it was not merely a political setback but a stinging lesson in the fragility of coalition politics.By any measure, the 1999 episode could be read as a betrayal. And yet, nearly three decades on, history appears to be folding in on itself.With the Tamil Nadu Assembly elections just months away, the BJP has formally sealed an alliance with the AIADMK, now led by former chief minister and party general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami (EPS). The objective is unmistakable: to build a formidable front aimed at unseating the incumbent DMK government under chief minister M K Stalin From 1999 to 2026, the relationship between the BJP and the AIADMK has followed a familiar cycle – alliance, rupture, and reunion. Despite repeated breakups, political compulsions have ensured that the two parties keep finding their way back to each other.While the BJP and AIADMK share a long history of alliances, the relationship has rarely been smooth. It has unravelled abruptly more than once, exposing deep mistrust beneath the surface.The most dramatic rupture came in 1999, when Jayalalithaa withdrew support to the Vajpayee government, leading to its collapse by a single vote.Yet, within a few years, the two parties were back together. That cycle has repeated itself multiple times since then – most recently after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, when they fought separately, only to return to the same negotiating table ahead of the 2026 assembly polls.The story of BJP-AIADMK ties is therefore less about ideology and more about arithmetic – a relationship driven by necessity.In the 1998 Lok Sabha elections, which paved the way for BJP stalwart Atal Bihari Vajpayee to become prime minister, the BJP extended a conciliatory hand to the Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK. The partnership, however, proved short-lived. Within a year, the AIADMK withdrew its support from the NDA, bringing down the vulnerable Vajpayee-led multiparty government.The rupture came against the backdrop of multiple corruption cases against Jayalalithaa and her fraught relationship with the DMK. The Supreme Court dealt a blow to her legal strategy by upholding the constitution of special courts and rejecting attempts to transfer the cases back to regular courts. This judicial setback hardened her political stance, culminating in the withdrawal of support from the Centre.In a dramatic turn, the rival DMK, led by veteran Dravidian leader M Karunanidhi, stepped in to extend support to the Vajpayee government, which went on to complete a full five-year term.Months ahead of the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the DMK severed ties with the BJP-led NDA. The saffron party then turned once again to the Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK, forging a fresh alliance in Tamil Nadu. The experiment, however, yielded little electoral dividend, with the BJP failing to win a single seat in the state.Nationally, the NDA’s “India Shining” campaign lost its sheen, paving the way for the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance to return to power at the Centre, with Manmohan Singh taking over as prime minister.In May 2004, then BJP president M Venkaiah Naidu told reporters in Chennai that the alliance with the AIADMK had been forged specifically for the elections—by then already over—signifying the largely tactical nature of the tie-up.Following the death of veteran politician and AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa in late 2016, the party that had ruled Tamil Nadu for decades was plunged into intense factionalism. A bitter succession battle unfolded, with multiple claimants emerging in the post-Amma era, including the Sasikala family, O Panneerselvam and Edappadi K Palaniswami, who eventually consolidated his position and now heads the party.During this period, while a formal alliance was absent, the AIADMK began extending policy-based support to the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre.The relationship eventually culminated in an electoral alliance for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The experiment, however, ended in a rout, with the AIADMK-BJP combine losing 39 of the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.Despite the 2019 debacle, the AIADMK-BJP alliance continued into the 2021 Assembly polls. The result was another defeat: AIADMK won just 66 seats, BJP managed four, and the DMK-Congress alliance stormed back to power under Stalin.The results suggested that the alliance helped the BJP gain a foothold but did little for the AIADMK.By 2022, the BJP contested local body polls alone. Ties finally snapped in 2023 after the BJP’s then state chief K Annamalai made controversial remarks on Jayalalithaa, triggering outrage within the AIADMK.Two years after their split, the BJP and AIADMK formally came together again in 2025, announcing that the NDA would contest the upcoming Assembly elections under the leadership of EPS.Once again, political necessity trumped past bitterness.For much of the past year, negotiations between the BJP and the AIADMK have been anything but decisive. The EPS-led AIADMK has repeatedly vacillated, weighing and re-weighing the costs and benefits of embracing the BJP as a partner to take on what is widely seen as a strong and entrenched Stalin-led DMK.Despite the prolonged uncertainty, the deal now appears almost final. All indications suggest that the two parties are set to formally revive the NDA alliance in Tamil Nadu just ahead of the polls.As the election drumbeat grows louder, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, undoubtedly the BJP’s most potent electoral face over the past decade, is scheduled to visit Madurai in the last week of February. In a symbolic show of unity, Palaniswami is expected to share the stage with PM Modi at a BJP-led rally, signalling that old animosities may finally be set aside.Tamil Nadu remains one of the BJP’s weakest links – a state where the saffron party has struggled to translate its national dominance into local relevance.The BJP’s renewed push for an alliance shows a hard political reality: the Dravidian voter base cannot be wooed by outsiders. Tamil Nadu politics remains firmly anchored in grassroots Tamil parties, principally the ruling DMK and the opposition AIADMK.Amit Shah , in particular, has sharpened his attacks on the Stalin government, accusing it of being “the most corrupt in the country” and of undermining Hindu values. His rhetoric often positions the AIADMK as a “natural ally,” a party that straddles the line between secular Dravidian politics and a softer form of Hindu assertion.The BJP’s immediate agenda is not necessarily to dominate but to prevent vote fragmentation that would otherwise benefit the DMK-Congress alliance.The AIADMK’s hesitation is rooted in precedent. The BJP has a track record of entering alliances as a junior partner, often presenting itself as a supportive force with access to power at the Centre, only to eventually upend the balance and emerge as the dominant player.The most recent example is Bihar. Like the AIADMK, Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) has been an on-again, off-again ally of the BJP and was long regarded as the “big brother” in the state. That equation changed dramatically in November 2025, when the BJP, for the first time, emerged larger than the JD(U) in terms of seats, even while conceding the chief minister’s post to Nitish Kumar.While the BJP is still far from posing an immediate threat to the AIADMK in Tamil Nadu, the insecurity within the EPS camp is palpable.The BJP’s renewed push for an alliance shows a hard political reality: the Dravidian voter base cannot be wooed by outsiders. Tamil Nadu politics remains firmly anchored in grassroots Tamil parties, principally the ruling DMK and the opposition AIADMK.The BJP’s immediate agenda is not necessarily to dominate but to prevent vote fragmentation that would otherwise benefit the DMK-Congress alliance. Tamil Nadu is one of the few states where the BJP’s organisational presence is weaker than that of the Congress, a party that has been in steady national decline for over a decade.To rebuild a broader NDA, the BJP is reaching out to a range of regional players. T T V Dhinakaran’s AMMK is already signalling interest in joining hands, while talks are ongoing with Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) founder S Ramadoss. Former allies and breakaway factions are also being courted as part of a larger consolidation exercise.Two years after their split, the BJP and AIADMK formally came together again in 2025, announcing that the NDA would contest the upcoming Assembly elections under the leadership of EPS.In New Delhi, the AIADMK is seen as the BJP’s primary vehicle for political relevance in the southern state, a view that reflects the urgency of Amit Shah’s strategy.Calling the BJP-AIADMK tie-up a “natural alliance,” Shah argued that the outcome of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections would have been very different had the two parties contested together.“We fought together in 1998, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, and in the 2021 assembly polls. But in 2024, we contested separately. If our vote shares are to be combined, we would have won 36 seats,” he said, adding that 2024 and 2025 had been victorious years for the BJP in several states and that the trend would repeat in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.Tamil Nadu BJP chief Nainar Nagenthran echoed the sentiment, claiming widespread public disillusionment with the DMK government. He blamed former minister Senthil Balaji for the Karur stampede during actor-politician Vijay’s TVK rally.These public assertions are aimed at projecting confidence, yet they also underline a deeper truth: without the AIADMK, the BJP has little realistic chance of expanding in Tamil Nadu on its own.The AIADMK’s electoral strategy continues to focus on Dalits and Thevars – communities that together account for roughly one-third of the state’s electorate. The BJP, in contrast, is pursuing a broader Hindu consolidation strategy that often cuts across Tamil Nadu’s complex caste equations.The NDA could also benefit from the support of the Vanniyars, who make up around 15 per cent of the population and are largely represented by the PMK.EPS himself brings caste capital to the alliance. A Gounder, classified under the Backward Classes, he represents a community that constitutes around 7 per cent of the state’s population and is concentrated in the Kongu Nadu belt.After years of mistrust, breakups and reconciliations, both parties now appear determined to hold hands against the Stalin government.Palaniswami has called the AIADMK-BJP alliance “essential” to unseat what he terms an “anti-people” DMK government.“AIADMK will capture power with absolute majority in 2026… Never in the history of Tamil Nadu has there been such a corrupt, incompetent anti-people government,” EPS said.Amit Shah struck a similar tone, accusing the DMK of dynastic politics and corruption, and declaring that the NDA would remove the Stalin government “at all cost.”From 1999 to 2026, the BJP and AIADMK have parted ways more than once, only to reunite when elections approach. Whether this latest reunion becomes a durable partnership or another short-lived truce will ultimately be decided by the Tamil voter.","The relationship between the bjp and the aiadmk has followed a familiar cycle – alliance, rupture, and reunion. Despite repeated breakups, political compulsions have ensured that the two parties keep finding their way back to each other. The objective is unmistakable: to build a formidable front aimed at unseating the incumbent dmk government.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128075387,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-838773,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
Young J&K MLA draws praise from across the aisle for House speech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/young-jk-mla-draws-praise-from-across-the-aisle-for-house-speech/articleshow/128081626.cms,"(PTI photo)

JAMMU: A young BJP legislator in J&K Saturday drew rare praise from across the political aisle with her speech in the Assembly, which she confined strictly to budgetary issues in the otherwise highly polarised House.Devyani Singh Rana, 31, is the daughter of former Nagrota MLA Devender Rana, who died in 2024 after winning the assembly election. In Oct 2025, BJP fielded Devyani from Nagrota in the bypoll, which she won. After her father’s death, Devyani had joined BJP and was appointed vice-president of the J&K BJP Yuva Morcha in Jan 2025.While governing National Conference legislators focused on J&K’s special status, BJP used the debate to highlight what it described as developmental gains after the abrogation of Article 370.Devyani, however, flagged electricity shortages, raised concerns over the union territory’s growing climate vulnerabilities, education sector and transportation as members listened to her raptly for around 12 minutes.In her speech, she deprecated Rs 271-cr reduction in disaster management, relief and rehabilitation department allocation, saying the sharp cut comes in a year that saw unprecedented and intense rainfall that devastated large parts of rural Jammu.Referring to tragedies in her constituency, she cited the death of three-year-old Mahi in a landslide and 28-year-old Sheer Khan, who drowned in a river. “These names represent the lives lost in the Jammu division,” she said, calling for stronger flood and landslide management measures.About flash floods that hit Jammu last year, Rana said, people lost their lives, bridges were damaged, roads became unsafe and houses were destroyed. “Our children were stranded at home and in colleges. Apple trucks were stuck on the Jammu–Srinagar National Highway (NH-44), and our traders suffered losses,” she said. She called for more allocation in disaster management as Jammu and Kashmir, she said, is “earthquake-prone, landslide-prone and fire-prone. ”Devyani also flagged under-spending in the social sectors. “If around Ra 193 crore is spent less on education, then how will the children of poor families be uplifted,” she said.She also pointed to a reduction of Rs 782.8 crore in power capital expenditure, saying it comes at a time when voltage remains unstable and transformers frequently fail.While welcoming the initiative of free bus travel for persons with disabilities, the MLA questioned its effective implementation. “Are these buses adequately equipped with ramps and access mechanisms? And when there have been documented cases of buses failing to stop even for women, what deterrent exists to ensure compliance?” she asked.As she ended her speech, members from the NC, BJP and PDP thumped their tables and crossed over to her seat to congratulate her.Devyani holds a degree in economics from the University of California. The eldest of three siblings — two sisters and a brother — she is a businesswoman who took over the management of the family business after her father’s death. “I feel humbled and very blessed by the response to my speech. We all work for the public good,” Devyani told TOI.She said since the ongoing Assembly session is the budget session, she preferred to focus on the budget only to identify problem areas that could be addressed in coming years. “I chose to speak in English because the budget across all quarters is presented and discussed in English,” she said.","Devyani singh rana, 31, is the daughter of former nagrota mla devender rana. After her father’s death, devyani joined bjp and was appointed vice-president of the j&k bjp yuva morcha in jan 2025.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128081636,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1500706,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A day after a joint statement on the India-US interim trade deal was released, Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Sunday said it will ""give new wings to dreams of farmers"", and rejected Congress' criticism, saying the deal fully protects agriculture sector and farmers' interests, with key farm products kept out.The minister also shared a detailed list of Indian farm produce that will be exported to the US at zero duty. The list of such produce also includes spices, tea, coffee, coconut, coconut oil, betel nut, cashew, vegetable wax, avocado, banana, guava, mango, kiwi, papaya, pineapple, mushroom, and some grains.On Congress' claim that the agreement could turn India into a ""dumping ground"" for US goods, Chouhan, while rejecting the assertion, said opposition is creating unnecessary fear, and accused the party of failing to link farmers to global markets or ensuring economic stability despite governing the country for long.Addressing a press conference in Bhopal, Chouhan said the trade deal is an excellent example of diplomacy, development and dignity.""It is not just a commercial agreement but also a symbol of India's growing global prestige. This deal will strengthen our economy while also providing it new direction,"" the minister said.""The biggest concern was that our major grains should remain secure, and they have all been kept completely secure.No door has been opened for the US for major grains, major fruits and dairy products,"" said Chouhan, allaying apprehensions in certain quarters about the deal's adverse impact on farmers.He said several American agricultural products will not be able to enter the Indian market. ""De-husked grains, flour, wheat, corn, rice, millet, potato, onion, peas, beans, cucumber, mushroom, pulses products, frozen vegetables, oranges, grapes, lemon, strawberry and mixed canned vegetables will not come to India,"" he said.He further added that no dairy products - such as liquid milk, powder, cream, yogurt, buttermilk, butter, ghee, butter oil, paneer and cheese - will get entry into India. He said India will also not import black pepper, cloves, dry green chilli, cinnamon, coriander, cumin, asafoetida, ginger, turmeric, carom seeds, fenugreek, cassia, mustard, rye, husk and other powder spices from the US. ""The meaning is clear - our spices and our farmers are completely secure,"" he said.He also highlighted the reduced tariffs on Indian textiles compared to competing countries, which he said will boost exports and benefit cotton farmers.","""to benefit farmers...."" shivraj singh chouhan big claim on india-us trade deal.

"Highway builders seek PM’s intervention on PPP project timelines, arbitration curbs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/highway-builders-seek-pms-intervention-on-ppp-project-timelines-arbitration-curbs/articleshow/128081119.cms,"PM Modi

NEW DELHI: Country’s apex highway builders organisation has sought PM Narendra Modi ’s intervention to review the squeezed construction timelines for big highway projects on PPP, their overall bankability and modification in dispute redressal through arbitration.The National Highways Builders Federation (NHBF), in a letter addressed to the PM, has referred to a recently floated tender for a 200-km greenfield project on Public Private Partnership (PPP) in which a two-year construction period has been set.“Considering the scale of such projects and the scope of activities involving land availability, utility shifting, major and minor structures, interchanges, safety provisions and stringent quality standards, the industry apprehends that such timelines may pose significant execution challenges, even best efforts,” NHBF said.It has cited how the Delhi-Vadodara Greenfield Expressway, despite focused attention and continuous efforts by stakeholders, is yet to be completed even after more than five years from commencement. It has urged govt to set realistic construction timelines to ensure quality and timely completion.It has also raised its concern over the recent amendments to dispute resolution provisions of PPP agreements, wherein arbitration for disputes above Rs 10 crore has been restricted.The changes have been made with reference to the finance ministry’s June 2024 circular.NHBF has said that while arbitration has been curtailed, “well-advised and financially strong participants may still bid, but disputes — if they arise — are likely to go to courts”. It said in such a scenario, even relatively small contractual issues may result in prolonged litigation, disruption to project execution and escalation of claim values, ultimately leading to higher fiscal exposure for govt, rather than faster or more efficient dispute resolution.“There is also a concern that such a framework may inadvertently encourage the emergence of entities oriented more towards litigation-driven outcomes than execution, and that even minor disputes could potentially lead to complete stalling of projects, which may not align with the original objectives of the PPP highway programme,” the highway builders body said.",The national highways builders federation (nhbf) has referred to a recently floated tender for a 200-km greenfield project on public private partnership (ppp) in which a two-year construction period has been set.

'Why Was My Life Ruined?': Tej Pratap Yadav's Ex-Wife Lashes Out at Lalu, Rabri, Tejashwi Yadav

NEW DELHI: Janshakti Janata Dal (JJD) chief Tej Pratap Yadav on Sunday strongly denied rumours circulating on social media that a woman allegedly linked to him has given birth to his child, calling the claims false and defamatory.He accused political rivals and former associates of deliberately spreading misinformation and said that he would take legal action Addressing a late-evening press conference, former Bihar minister said that the rumours had caused him severe mental distress and were part of a targeted campaign to malign him. He claimed the speculation resurfaced months after a controversy that led to his expulsion from the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), headed by his father Lalu Prasad.“I am distraught at rumours on social media that a woman with whom I had been falsely linked several months ago, which resulted in my expulsion from the party, has given birth to my child,” Yadav said.Providing background to the controversy, Yadav recalled that a post had gone viral last year from his Facebook account, claiming he had been “in a relationship, for 12 years” with a woman. He reiterated that the post was not authored by him and alleged that his social media account had been compromised.He claimed the post was the result of “hacking” carried out by what he described as “the five Jaichands,” using a metaphor for traitors.Naming them publicly, Yadav said, “There has been some suspense about who the Jaichands I have been speaking about are. Here are the names — Mukesh Raushan, Sanjay Yadav, Shakti Singh Yadav, Rameez and Sunil Singh.”Notably, Sanjay Yadav is a sitting RJD Rajya Sabha MP, Sunil Singh is a member of the legislative council, Mukesh Raushan and Shakti Singh Yadav are former MLAs and Rameez is considered close to Tejashwi Yadav, Tej Pratap’s younger brother and the RJD’s national working president.Rejecting the latest claims outright, Yadav told reporters, “I reject this completely, a controversy was created, Akash Bhati will be revealing the truth. They are trying to defame me. I will go to court.”He said he became aware of the rumours after being told that union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi had “congratulated” him on the alleged birth of a child, which he said shocked him.Yadav also linked the renewed controversy to his recent political activities. “Recently, I hosted a well-attended feast on the occasion of Makar Sankranti. This has made my detractors wary of the prospects of my party. I will seek legal action against them. I will move the court. I have also sought an appointment with Home Minister Samrat Choudhary,” he said.Appealing for an end to the speculation, he added, “I beg my detractors to let me live in peace. I know the person with whom the woman is in a relationship and who, I believe, is the father of the child. They are causing mental anguish to me by dragging my name.”Tej Pratap Yadav was expelled from the RJD last year for what the party described as “serious breaches of moral and social values,” following a public fallout triggered by the viral Facebook post.The episode added to long-running controversies surrounding him, including his strained marriage with Aishwarya, the granddaughter of former Bihar chief minister Daroga Rai.Aishwarya had left their matrimonial home within months of the wedding, alleging mistreatment, and the divorce case is still pending in court.Since his expulsion, Yadav has floated his own political outfit, the Janshakti Janata Dal and has repeatedly ruled out any return to the RJD, saying he would “choose death over returning to that party.” He has maintained that his political journey is guided by “principles and self-respect,” not by the pursuit of power.",Janshakti janata dal (jjd) chief tej pratap yadav strongly denied rumours circulating on social media that a woman allegedly linked to him has given birth to his child.

A stream of hope flows in Bundelkhand through 'Har Ghar Nal',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-stream-of-hope-flows-in-bundelkhand-through-har-ghar-nal/articleshow/128078386.cms,"-

LUCKNOW: For the people of Bundelkhand, this is nothing short of a dream come true that water is now available inside their homes. There are countless stories of hunger, poverty, and hardship linked to water scarcity in this region.The image of a woman carrying a pot of water on her head from faraway places had, for years, become the very identity of Bundelkhand’s districts.For decades, women here endured the water crisis. They walked long distances to reach remote wells and stood in queues at handpumps to collect water. But all this is now part of the past. Today, water tanks visible from afar stand as flowing streams of hope.This scene in Bundelkhand can captivate anyone. In Marwari Gram Panchayat of Panwari block in Mahoba, a woman adjusts her veil outside her house and fills a bucket with water from a tap, while a six-year-old child stands nearby holding a glass. The happiness on the woman’s face says everything about what this tap means to her.When asked, she replies shyly, “Brother, a big crisis has been removed.” When asked whether water comes regularly, her enthusiasm is evident. “Yes, why not. It comes every day.”When asked who all have tap connections, the village head standing nearby explains in detail, “Everyone in the village has it. Water comes twice a day. One tap connection is public, where anyone passing by can drink water.”Talking about Mahoba, the people here had long endured extreme hardship due to water scarcity. At one point, water had to be supplied through water trains. People wandered far and wide just to fill a single pot of water. Now, water tanks visible from a distance tell a completely new story.Under the Jal Jeevan Mission, through five projects, pipeline connectivity has been provided to more than 1.12 lakh households in the district. However, this large-scale scheme did not take shape easily. About 1,131 kilometers of roads were damaged during the work. While repair work was carried out, people did face some inconvenience.Arshad from Mahoba says that whenever a scheme begins, some inconvenience is inevitable, but “Har Ghar Nal” has emerged as a very big hope for this region.In Chitrakoot, under the Silauta Gram Mustakil Group Scheme, the water problem of about 1.25 lakh people in the development blocks of Pahadi, Ramnagar, and Manikpur has been resolved. The hardship of Manikpur’s residents can be understood from the fact that they earlier had to bring water from nearly one kilometer away.Because of this problem, people were often reluctant to marry off their daughters. For them, this water means life itself and the future of their children.Under the scheme, a total of 576 km of pipeline was planned, of which 572 km has already been laid. There are 17 overhead tanks, where water is brought daily from the water treatment plant. Water is drawn from the Yamuna River, treated at the plant, lifted into tanks, and then supplied to people’s homes.Smt. Rajjan Devi, the village head of Barhat, becomes emotional while talking about this scheme. She says, “We are grateful to the Yogi-Modi government for making arrangements to protect our children from diseases. Our children now bathe and go to school. A sense of cleanliness has automatically developed in them.”Along with Silauta, Raipura and Chandi Bangar group drinking water schemes are also being implemented in Chitrakoot. These schemes represent streams of hope that people had never even imagined.Under the Raipura Gram Samuh Peyjal Yojana, the target was to provide tap water to 19,570 families. Taps have been installed in all these houses, and water supply has begun in 60 revenue villages.Chunbad Yadav, a resident of Madna village covered under the scheme, says that a major problem has been resolved. Arranging water even for daily use was difficult earlier, and water for livestock was out of the question. Now they no longer have to worry.This may appear to be just about a tap, but for Bundelkhand, it is a blessing. It represents the fulfillment of a resolve that the Modi-Yogi government undertook as a mission.In Jhansi district, Jal Jeevan Mission pipelines have reached even the last-mile villages in Bada village, Chirgaon, and Bangra.Kamta Prasad, a 65-year-old resident of Gairaha Gram Panchayat in Bangra block, becomes emotional and says that his eyes had longed to see this day.Shagun, a married woman from this village located far from the district headquarters, says ‘earlier she had to walk half a kilometer outside the village to fetch water, and the situation became extremely difficult during the rainy season’.In Pachwara Gram Panchayat of Bangra block, when Ragini came as a daughter-in-law, she had to fetch water from a government handpump. Today, she proudly turns the tap and shows how clean the water is.The daughter-in-law of a poor family is happy that her husband Mukesh Kumar, a daily wage laborer, did not have to pay even a single rupee for the tap connection.Village head Akhilesh Rawat says, ‘about one thousand connections have been provided in his village’. In this Dalit-dominated village, the Arogya Mandir built during the Yogi government also has a tap connection under the Jal Jeevan Mission, ensuring clean drinking water for patients and attendants. Government schoolchildren are also now drinking clean water.Executive Engineer of the Jal Jeevan Mission, Ranvijay Singh, says that 42 villages are covered under this scheme, with 11,437 connections provided.Earlier, the very mention of Banda would bring to mind drought, water scarcity, and thirst. Now, through the Amlikaur Drinking Water Project and the Khatan Drinking Water Project, water has reached 544 villages, and 82,266 households have been provided connections.Pardeshi, a resident of Bandha Purwa village in Badokhar Khurd block says, ‘earlier they struggled a lot for water, but now they are receiving clean water inside their homes’.Executive Engineer of Jal Nigam, Vimal Kumar Verma says, ‘that roads dug up for pipeline laying have also been repaired’.In Hamirpur district as well, two drinking water projects are underway, through which tap water is being supplied to homes in 320 out of 322 villages. For the people here, this scheme is set to play a very significant role in transforming daily life.","The image of a woman carrying a pot of water from faraway places had, for years, become the very identity of bundelkhand’s districts.

He lost his life while saving others. All possible assistance will be provided, including financial support and a government job for one of his children,” the chief minister said.He added that those seriously injured would receive Rs 1 lakh each, while treatment costs for all injured would be borne by the state.Police have already registered an FIR in the case and arrested Mohammad Shakir, proprietor of Himachal Fun Care Company that operated the ride, along with his staff member Nitesh.They have been booked under charges including culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Investigators are examining whether safety norms were violated and if there was criminal negligence.Meanwhile, the amusement park at the Surajkund Mela venue has been closed with immediate effect, though the fair itself continues as scheduled. The district administration has also formed a separate ADC-level inquiry committee to examine the technical and mechanical aspects of the accident.Officials said that a detailed report will be prepared to determine the exact cause of the collapse and fix responsibility.

Weeks After Noida Techie's Death, Delhi Biker Dies After Falling Into Pit Dug By Jal Board

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Delhi unit president Saurabh Bharadwaj, along with several party workers was detained by police on Sunday while protesting in west Delhi’s Janakpuri over the death of 25-year-old Kamal Dhyani.The protest was organised to demand justice for Dhyani, who died earlier on Thursday after his motorcycle allegedly fell into an unmarked pit.According to the AAP, Bharadwaj and other leaders had gathered in Janakpuri to pay tribute to Dhyani by lighting candles. However, Delhi police erected barricades across the area and detained the protesters.In a series of posts on X, Bharadwaj said that he was being taken away by the police and questioned the action against what he described as a peaceful tribute.“Today we had come to Janakpuri to pay tribute to Kamal Dhyaani who was killed there. The police has put up barricades everywhere today. We said no sloganeering is happening, we will just light candles and leave. Is even this much now a crime?” he wrote.He also raised political allegations in his post, claiming, “The BJP government had stolen the election through deceit and fraud exactly one year ago today, and the entire Delhi is commemorating this one-year anniversary.”Bharadwaj further demanded justice for Kamal Dhyani, action against the Delhi Police Commissioner and criticised Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta.Speaking to reporters while being detained, Bharadwaj accused the authorities of suppressing dissent. “You can see the level of dictatorship. No one lodged a complaint, even when the parents of Kamal Dhyani went to six police stations. The police are detaining us when we have all gathered to pay tribute to him,” he said.The protest follows days of sharp criticism by the AAP against the Delhi Police and the BJP-led Delhi government over Dhyani’s death.Bharadwaj has alleged police negligence and attempts to hide crucial information related to the case. He claimed that Dhyani’s family visited six police stations on the night of the incident but no missing complaint was registered and that the location data of the victim’s mobile phone was allegedly deleted.Dhyani, a resident of Janakpuri, reportedly fell into a deep pit late at night while riding his motorcycle on February 5. His family and friends have alleged that the pit was poorly barricaded and unmarked and that timely police action could have saved his life.The incident has drawn comparisons with a recent case in Noida, where a young IT professional died after his car plunged into a water-filled construction pit, renewing concerns over road safety , unmarked construction sites and accountability of civic authorities in the Delhi-NCR region.The Delhi government has said that it has taken cognisance of the Janakpuri incident and assured action against those responsible. Meanwhile, the AAP has said it will continue to raise the issue and demand accountability for what it calls a preventable tragedy.","Aam aadmi party (aap) leader and delhi unit president saurabh bharadwaj was detained by police on sunday while protesting in west delhi’s janakpuri.

Congress pushes back

Who is Jamaat-e-Islami in Kerala?

A triangular contest

The broader political calculus

NEW DELHI: As Kerala heads toward another high-stakes assembly election, a controversial name has returned to the centre of a new political storm. Jamaat-e-Islami, long part of the state's complex web of alliances and rivalries, is now the trigger for an escalating war of words between the CPM , the Congress and the BJP.What began as a debate over electoral support has quickly turned into a larger fight over secularism, minority politics and ideological credibility.The latest round of exchanges was triggered after Congress leader and the leader of the opposition VD Satheesan indicated that the UDF would accept support from Jamaat-e-Islami, asserting that the organisation had clarified it does not advocate a religion-based nation in India.That remark drew immediate criticism from both the CPM and the BJP, who accused the Congress of legitimising a group they describe as communal.Senior BJP leader K Surendran accused the Congress of closeness with Jamaat-e-Islami and alleged that the party was “whitewashing” communal forces. He went further, claiming that “sharia” would be implemented in Kerala if the Congress and the UDF came to power. “The Congress has now adopted a blatant communal stand by whitewashing terrorist groups like Jamaat-e-Islami,” Surendran said.The CPM, too, sharpened its attack. State secretary M V Govindan alleged that the Congress had adopted a position portraying Jamaat-e-Islami as a non-communal organisation and accused it of attempting to give the outfit a “good certificate”.Satheesan rejected the allegations and accused the CPM of hypocrisy. He alleged that the Marxist party had itself benefited from Jamaat-e-Islami support in the past.“CPM is hypocritical. Until the parliamentary elections, they appeased minorities. Later, they appeased majority communities. Currently, there is confusion overall. They are in a state where they do not know what they are saying or doing. They are pretending to forget what they said in the past,” Satheesan said during the UDF’s Puthu Yuga Yatra in Kasaragod.He further claimed, “For 42 years, Jamaate-Islami was aligned with the CPM. Many times, individuals like Govindan and Pinarayi Vijayan were elected with the support of Jamaat-e-Islami. Clips of Pinarayi Vijayan’s speech justifying Jamaat-e-Islami and Deshabhimani’s editorial can be sent to Govindan. If his forgetfulness is deliberate, then nothing can be done.”Satheesan also argued that the opposition was unfairly being targeted for engaging with community organisations. “We do not interfere in the internal matters of any community organisations. Our wish is for everyone to walk together. It is not the opposition leader’s job to comment on any of this,” he said.In Kerala, references to Jamaat-e-Islami typically point to Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, a socio-religious organisation with an active presence in the state through educational institutions, social initiatives and community networks. Its political platform is the Welfare Party of India, which has contested elections and participated in local alliances.The organisation is not a dominant electoral force in Kerala but commands influence in certain regions, particularly in parts of northern districts. In a closely contested political landscape where margins can matter, even limited organisational backing can acquire significance.Jamaat-e-Islami has been in controversy several times for its ultra-conservative views. Only last month its leader Shaikh Muhammed Karakunnu said that no true believer who loves Prophet Muhammad can reject Islamic Republic.In a Facebook post titled ‘Would true believers reject Islamic Republic?' posted on January 17, Karakunnu said Prophet was the founder of Islamic Republic, and its headquarters was Medina and it was established without shedding even a single drop of blood.The remarks came amid the CPM's attack on Jamaat-e-Islami, accusing the organisation of subscribing to the ideology of establishing a theocratic nation.CPM leaders were quick to cite Karakunnu's remarks as vindication of their stand.""The people of that land welcomed its leader with open arms, choosing him as their ruler. They even gave their land his name: Madinatun-Nabi (The City of the Prophet). It was an ideal-based, humanitarian and pluralistic nation. At that time, the Muslim population there was only 15%,"" he said.Kerala’s politics has traditionally been bipolar, with power alternating between the CPM-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the Congress-led UDF. The BJP, despite a growing vote share, has struggled to translate support into seats. In this context, debates over minority outreach and ideological positioning carry both symbolic and electoral weight.For the CPM, attacking the Congress over Jamaat-e-Islami allows it to question the UDF’s secular credentials while attempting to consolidate its own base among both minority and majority voters. For the BJP, the issue provides an opportunity to frame the Congress and the Left as engaging in minority appeasement, a narrative it has consistently deployed in Kerala.The Congress, meanwhile, appears to be balancing objectives of reassuring minority voters that it remains open to their support, while countering charges that it is endorsing communal politics.Kerala has a significant Muslim population, and minority consolidation can influence outcomes in several constituencies. Historically, the Indian Union Muslim League has been the primary Muslim political force within the UDF. However, the presence of organisations like Jamaat-e-Islami adds layers to the competitive dynamic.The CPM has previously worked with various community organisations, and its leaders have often defended engagement as part of Kerala’s plural political culture. The Congress now argues that similar engagement cannot be selectively labelled communal.The BJP’s intervention introduces a national dimension, especially as it seeks to expand its footprint in a state where it has yet to break through decisively. By raising the spectre of “sharia” and accusing the Congress of legitimising extremist forces, it seeks to polarise the debate and position itself as the defender of secular governance.The controversy has also intersected with rival mass contact programmes. While the UDF is conducting its Puthu Yuga Yatra to present what it describes as a vision for Kerala’s future, the LDF is running the Vikasana Munnetta Jatha to highlight development initiatives under chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.Each side has used the Jamaat-e-Islami debate to undercut the other’s campaign narrative. Satheesan has suggested that the CPM’s criticism stems from discomfort over the UDF’s electoral confidence, while CPM leaders argue that the Congress is attempting to normalise communal elements.At its core, the clash over Jamaat-e-Islami reflects deeper tensions in Kerala politics like how parties engage with community organisations, how secularism is defined in practice, and how minority support is negotiated in a competitive electoral field.","Jamaat-e-islami, long part of the state's complex web of alliances and rivalries, is now the trigger for an escalating war of words between the cpm, the congress and the bjp. What began as a debate over electoral support has quickly turned into a larger fight over secularism, minority politics and ideological credibility.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128073857,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-65704,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
