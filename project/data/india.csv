Seelampur teen murder: 'Lady Don' held as cops probe gang rivalry angle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lady-don-under-lens-as-gang-revenge-angle-emerges-in-delhi-teens-murder/articleshow/120409591.cms,"Photo: X

NEW DELHI: A 17-year-old boy named Kunal was fatally stabbed in north-east Delhi’s New Seelampur on Thursday evening, triggering tensions in the area. According to police, a local woman named Zikra, allegedly known as the 'lady don', has been detained and is being investigated in connection with the murder.Kunal’s family has alleged that Zikra, who once worked as a bouncer for jailed gangster Hashim Baba's wife Zoya, was present at the scene when he was killed.“Zikra used to roam around in the area with a pistol. An incident happened with her cousin Sahil but my son was not involved in it. Yet they killed him. They brutally stabbed him multiple times,” Kunal’s mother Parveen told news agency PTI.Zikra was reportedly living with Zoya before the latter’s arrest by Delhi Police in a drug-related case. After Zoya was jailed, Zikra was said to be forming her own gang.She was previously arrested under the Arms Act after she posted a video on social media brandishing a pistol. She is currently out on bail and had been living in a rented house close to Kunal’s residence.Joint Commissioner of Police (Eastern Range) Pushpendra Kumar said, “We have identified the accused who will be nabbed soon. Ten teams have been formed to crack the case, and they are looking at all possible angles. We have detained a few people for questioning. The case will be solved soon.”CCTV footage led the police to identify two suspects, Sahil and Rehan, in connection with the stabbing. According to sources, Zikra has been detained for questioning, although no formal arrest has been made yet.The motive behind the murder appears to be an act of revenge. Sources revealed that Kunal may have been involved in an earlier attack on Zikra’s cousin Sahil. Police had registered an attempt to murder case against some members of Kunal’s community over that previous incident.“It is suspected that Kunal was also involved in the stabbing of Sahil. Although Sahil did not die, he, along with Zikra, hatched a plan to take revenge for the attack,” said a family source.Zikra reportedly was leading a gang of 10-12 youths, several of whom are now under scrutiny in connection with Kunal’s killing. Fear has reportedly gripped the locality, with some residents allegedly fleeing the area to escape possible retaliation.Amid growing unrest, local police and the Rapid Action Force (RAF) have been deployed to maintain order. Protests have been staged by local people and members of Hindu outfits, including the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP). Posters bearing slogans like ""Hindus are migrating"" and ""Please help, Yoji ji"" appeared in the area but were later removed by police.The incident has further escalated tensions between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), with both blaming each other for the breakdown of law and order in the national capital.","A 17-year-old boy named kunal was fatally stabbed in north-east delhi’s new seelampur on thursday evening.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal governor CV Ananda Bose on Friday visited Malda to meet the Murshidabad riot-affected victims, who had to flee the district after violent clashes occurred during the anti-Waqf law protest last week.The governor, after the visit, claimed that women told him ""they were intimidated"" and that ""miscreants came into their houses and they were physically assaulted, abusive words were used"".Assuring proactive action, Bose said he had a detailed discussion with the victims in the camp where they have been staying as a temporary arrangement.""I met the family members who are in this camp. I had a detailed discussion with them. I listened to their grievances and understood their feelings. They also informed me of their requirements. Certainly, proactive action will be taken,"" the West Bengal governor, who ignored CM Mamata Banerjee 's request to postpone the visit, told news agency ANI.According to several reports, Bose is set to visit Murshidabad on Saturday, where the violence broke out, killing three people and injuring several others.Displaced residents taking refuge at a relief camp set up on the premises of Parlalpur High School in Malda claimed they were being ""confined"" and barred from leaving the campus or contacting their relatives.Tensions reportedly rose at the camp in Baishnabnagar when police restricted journalists from entering during the visit of Bose. The move sparked protests from the displaced people, who expressed frustration over the lack of communication and transparency.""We have been confined by police here and cannot move freely,"" alleged one of the camp inmates, according to ANI.""We are not allowed to go out or interact with our relatives here. We do not know why the media is not allowed inside when the governor is here and talking to us. We want the world to know about our talks with him,"" the inmate alleged.A team from the National Commission for Women (NCW), headed by chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar, also visited the Malda relief camp. The delegation reviewed the condition of women who were affected by the violence that followed anti-Waqf law protests .Expressing shock at the situation faced by the displaced women, Rahatkar said: ""I have met and interacted with women and children here at the camp. They have shared the situations they had faced. These women and children faced a lot of problems and they were forcibly evicted. What they had gone through is beyond imagination.""NCW member Archana Majumdar, who accompanied Rahatkar, alleged that the women were molested and forcibly thrown out of their homes.""It is the duty of the state government to protect them. What are they doing? Is the TMC government planning to turn West Bengal into a second Bangladesh?"" Majumdar said, lashing out at the state administration’s handling of the crisis.The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) announced plans to hold a nationwide protest on Saturday, demanding the imposition of President's rule in the state. The Hindu outfit's president Alok Kumar said that the organisation’s members and supporters will stage dharnas at district headquarters across the country to protest the unrest in Murshidabad.""We will give memoranda to the district magistrates demanding that the central government contemplate the imposition of President's rule in West Bengal ,"" Kumar told news agency PTI.Referring to a meeting between CM Mamata Banerjee and Muslim clerics, Kumar noted her remark that the Murshidabad violence was ""pre-planned.""""If it is pre-planned, did the state intelligence agencies give any prior information to her government? And if not, who is responsible for such failure?"" he asked. ""If there was any report, why were precautionary measures to prevent the violence not taken?"" Kumar added.While the Trinamool Congress (TMC) accused the BJP of doing ""politics"" instead of taking appropriate steps, its ally Congress has planned a visit to the affected areas, which might not go well with Mamata.Kalyan Banerjee on Friday attacked Union home minister Amit Shah and accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of doing ""politics"" instead of taking appropriate steps.""They (BJP) have been demanding President's rule (in West Bengal) since 2019. This is their routine demand. We do not give this demand any importance. The matter (Bengal violence) is going on in the High Court. The High Court is satisfied with the steps taken by us. The situation was definitely bad, but it has improved due to the steps taken by the state government and the state government also took the help of central paramilitary forces.

DGCA orders probe into Air India Express captain Armaan's death at Delhi Airport

NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered a thorough investigation into the death of Air India Express First Officer Armaan's death who had collapsed after safely landing a Srinagar-Delhi flight last Wednesday. In his order, DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai has said that the probe team will take into account factors like the deceased pilot's medical history; whether any protocol needs to be devised for crew with such medical conditions and the time taken at Delhi Airport in providing the pilot the required care and the quality of the same.The probe panel comprising of Vishal Yadav, DGCA's deputy director air safety as investigator-in-charge, and Group Captain Murtaza, DMS (CA) subject matter expert as a member, has been asked to submit its report ""preferably"" within six months.Kidwai has asked the team to examine these points, among any other that the investigation throws up: ""Whether the crew reported about sickness to air traffic control (ATC) while in air and if so, whether ATC initiated action appropriately; check the medical history of the deceased crew; whether due precaution was taken during rostering of such crew who has flying restriction due to medical reasons.""""(Whether) any specific medical checks are required for such pilots to undergo before undertaking the flights; whether remaining onboard crew took action when crew reported feeling unwell; time taken in taking him to the medical centre at the airport/civil hospital; check the level of preparedness of the medical centre at the airport in handling such emergencies,' the probe panel has been asked to examine these areas too and also ""examine the existing guidelines / circulars in this regard and suggest changes if needed.""First officer Armaan, 35, had suffered a ""sudden cardiac arrest"" while operating flight IX-1153 from Srinagar to Delhi on April 9, 2025. After safely landing in Delhi, he went to the aircraft lavatory where he vomited. He collapsed in the forward galley and was taken to the airport medical centre by cabin crew and ground staff. He was then taken to a private hospital in Vasant Kunj but could not be saved.Armaan, who went by his first name only, had joined Air India Express in 2023 from SpiceJet. He had flown for less than 12 hours in the last seven days, it is learnt.Following his death, the Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA) had said in a statement there’s an urgent need to put in place transparent regulations that prioritise rest for pilots, safety and humane scheduling practices. The association, which represents over 800 pilots of various Indian carriers, has stressed the need for having comprehensive mental health support systems within airline organisations and not merely as checkboxes but as active, accessible, and stigma-free services. ALPA says the untimely death of Captain Armaan’s death raises troubling questions about pilot welfare, mental health, and working conditions in the Indian aviation industry.While not linking Armaan’s tragic death to fatigue, several pilots say they have for a long time been pleading for less strenuous working conditions in India. After a significant delay, slightly less strenuous flight duty time limitations (FDTL) rules — that govern key issues like how much a pilot can fly with what rest periods and limits on night flying — are set to be enforced from this summer.“Many pilots have lost their lives suddenly in last few years, especially post Covid, and we have been fighting for a more humane FDTL. We just hope nothing else delays implementation of the new rules, something which we have seen in the past. Well rested and not stressed pilots are key to safe flights,” said many senior pilots.","Dgca orders probe into air india express captain armaan's death at delhi airport.

'Haven’t taken anybody’s name': Baba Ramdev defends 'sharbat jihad' remark amid Rooh Afza row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/havent-taken-anybodys-name-baba-ramdev-defends-sharbat-jihad-remark-amid-rooh-afza-row/articleshow/120403981.cms,"Baba Ramdev (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Yoga guru Baba Ramdev on Friday defended his controversial "" sharbat jihad "" remark, saying he did not name any specific brand or community, even as criticism mounted over what was criticised as a communal statement allegedly aimed at the popular drink Rooh Afza .“I haven’t taken anybody’s name, but the Rooh Afza people took ‘sharbat jihad’ on themselves… this means they are doing this ‘jihad’,” Ramdev said.“If they are dedicated to Islam and are building masjids and madrasas, then they should be happy. However, the Sanatanis should understand… If someone has a problem with this, then let it be,"" he added.The controversy started around Baba Ramdev's statement earlier this week which was blasted by Congress leader Digvijaya Singh , who on Tuesday approached the TT Nagar police station in Bhopal demanding the registration of an FIR against Ramdev for allegedly promoting religious hatred and hurting communal sentiments.In his complaint, Singh, a Rajya Sabha MP from Madhya Pradesh, invoked sections 196(1)(a) and 299 of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, 2023, along with relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act. He alleged that Ramdev, while promoting Patanjali 's Gulab Sharbat, indirectly targeted Rooh Afza by implying that proceeds from its sale were used to fund madrasas and mosques — terming it “sharbat jihad.”Singh flagged a video purportedly shared from Ramdev’s official X account, claiming it was aimed at inciting communal sentiments to boost sales of Patanjali Ayurved's products. “This statement of Ramdev is hurtful, full of animosity, and intended to provoke religious sentiments,” Singh said. “Calling the sale of Rooh Afza ‘sharbat jihad’ is not just defamatory, but unconstitutional.”He had further alleged that Ramdev built a massive business empire by using religion and nationalism to promote his products, many of which, Singh claimed, have either failed to meet quality standards or have been banned by courts. “The entire country knows Ramdev was pointing at the Hamdard company, even though he didn’t name it directly,” Singh said. “Opposing a sharbat just because the owner is Muslim is hate speech, plain and simple.”Singh stated that if police fail to act within a week, he would approach the court seeking legal recourse. “I have demanded that an FIR be registered under the existing laws,” he said. Additional deputy commissioner of police Rashmi Agrawal confirmed that Singh’s complaint had been received. “We are probing the complaint and will take action as per the findings,” she said.","Yoga guru baba ramdev defends his controversial "" sharbat jihad "" remark.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs ( MEA ) on Friday strongly rejected Bangladesh 's comments regarding the recent communal violence in West Bengal's Murshidabad district, urging the neighbouring country to instead address the persecution of minorities within its own borders.""We reject the remarks made by the Bangladesh side with regard to the incidents in West Bengal. This is a barely disguised and disingenuous attempt to draw a parallel with India's concerns over the ongoing persecution of minorities in Bangladesh, where the criminal perpetrators of such acts continue to roam free,"" MEA said in a statement.""Instead of making unwarranted comments and indulging in virtue signalling, Bangladesh would do better to focus on protecting the rights of its own minorities,"" it added.India's response came after Bangladesh's chief adviser's press secretary, Shafiqul Alam, called on India to ""fully protect"" its Muslim minority population. Alam had also denied any Bangladeshi involvement in the Murshidabad violence through a statement to local media.""We strongly refute any attempts to implicate Bangladesh in the communal violence in Murshidabad,"" he told local daily.The violence, which erupted on April 11 during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act, claimed three lives and left several others injured. The unrest also resulted in significant property damage and forced many families to flee, with some seeking refuge in Jharkhand's Pakur district while others moved to relief camps in Malda.The Calcutta high court has ordered the continued deployment of central forces in Murshidabad to maintain law and order. The court, which will monitor the rehabilitation of victims, has also directed officials from political parties, including the BJP and TMC, to refrain from making inflammatory speeches that could worsen the situation.","India rejects bangladesh's comments regarding the recent communal violence in west bengal.

NEW DELHI: Govt will earn from the ropeway project connecting Sonprayag, Gaurikund and Kedarnath without any investment as Adani Enterprises has quoted a share of around 42% of the revenue with NHLML, the agency implementing such projects across the country. Considering that the nearly 13 km rope-way is expected to get a large number of pilgrims as it promises to reduce travel time to barely 36 minutes from 8-9 hours, three out of the four bidders had offered revenue sharing with the agency.The National Highway Logistics Management Ltd (NHLML) had earlier cancelled bids twice and after making several improvements, fresh bids were invited. Recently, the Cabinet had given its approval for the Rs 4,081 crore project to be implemented on public private partnership (PPP) mode.The ropeway will have the capacity to transport 18,000 persons per day or around 32 lakh per year. The Kedarnath temple is usually open for six months. The project will be completed in six years and the successful bidder will have the right to operate, maintain and collect the fare for 35 years.The Sonprayag-Kedarnath ropeway will be based on Tri-cable Detachable Gondola (3S) technology and each gandola can accommodate 36 passengers.Last year around 23 lakh pilgrims visited Kedarnath shrine.Officials said that the financial bids for the 12.4 km Govindghat-Ghangaria-Hemkund Sahib ropeway project would be opened next week.

'Tamil Nadu will never yield to Delhi's administration': MK Stalin's 'challenge' for Amit Shah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tamil-nadu-will-never-yield-to-delhis-administration-mk-stalins-challenge-for-amit-shah/articleshow/120403456.cms,"Poll Should states have more autonomy in decision-making? No, the central government should have the final say Yes, states should have more control

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Friday hit out at the central government, asserting that the state would never bow to the authority of New Delhi. Reaffirming the state’s independent political stance, Stalin said ""Tamil Nadu will never yield to Delhi's administration "".“Union Minister Amit Shah says they will form a government here in 2026. I challenge him - Tamil Nadu will never yield to Delhi’s rule. That may work elsewhere through party poaching and raids, but not here. This formula won’t work in Tamil Nadu,” Stalin declared at a rally in Tiruvallur.He also questioned Union home minister Amit Shah on key issues affecting the state, including the Neet examination and language imposition. “Can Amit Shah guarantee an exemption from Neet? Can he promise that Hindi will not be imposed? Has the Centre provided special funds to Tamil Nadu? Can he assure that delimitation won’t reduce our parliamentary seats?” Stalin asked.Responding to recent controversial remarks by Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who called the Tamil Nadu government “dishonest” and its people “uncivilised,” Stalin said such attempts to divide the state through political rhetoric would fail. “Even the Prime Minister in Odisha made disparaging remarks about Tamilians. These tactics won’t work here. Tamil Nadu cannot be divided through politics,” he said.Earlier this week, Stalin had intensified his campaign for greater autonomy for Tamil Nadu, following repeated clashes between the DMK government and Governor RN Ravi over pending legislation. On April 15, he moved a resolution in the state assembly to form a high-level committee tasked with recommending ways to enhance the state’s powers and reclaim its rights.The committee, headed by former Supreme Court Justice Kurian Joseph, will include retired IAS officer Ashok Vardhan Shetty and scholar Mu Nagarajan. It is expected to submit an interim report by January 2026 and a final report within two years, with a focus on strengthening state–Centre relations.","Tamil nadu chief minister mk stalin said the state would never bow to the authority of new delhi.

"Sidda in spot after ministers representing Vokkaligas, Lingayats red-flag caste census",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sidda-in-spot-after-ministers-representing-vokkaligas-lingayats-red-flag-caste-census/articleshow/120419357.cms,"BENGALURU: Ministers representing Karnataka's Vokkaliga and Lingayat communities have put the Siddaramaiah-led Congress govt in a spot, flagging the recalibrated caste survey data that the state plans to adopt as flawed and warning of social unrest if that were to be used to define reservation.A special cabinet meeting convened Thursday to discuss the report submitted to state govt last year ended without a consensus after at least two ministers pointed to alleged discrepancies in data.The Karnataka State Commission for Backward Classes, headed by H Kantharaj, started its socio-economic and educational survey in 2015, covering 5.9 crore people across 1.3 crore households. The survey was completed in 2018, but the report remained under wraps for years.Another commission, led by Jayaprakash Hegde, revised the report using data from Kantharaj commission.Although CM Siddaramaiah seems inclined to implement the report, opposition from some of his ministers has proved a hurdle. Those opposed to the report fault the methodology, pointing to allegedly inflated data pertaining to marginal sub-castes within the Vokkaliga and Lingayat communities and lower representation of the dominant sub-castes.Some have complained that no enumerator visited their houses in past decade. These charges have been fuelled by allegations of enumerators admitting the exercise was riddled with challenges because of inadequate publicity and public awareness.Urban enumeration was particularly problematic as they purportedly couldn't enter gated communities or high-rise apartment complexes where people from some dominant caste groups reside.""We were asked to survey large areas in a short time. In cities like Bengaluru, we would be turned away from flats, with residents unwilling to disclose caste details,"" said an enumerator who worked at Rajajinagar.A field officer from Davanagere shared similar concerns. ""We were asked to record caste details based on sub-sect & not religion. Many entries had to be completed manually, and there was confusion about caste classification as people gave evasive answers. Some communities were unsure how to describe themselves. This was because there was no awareness about the exercise and why it was being conducted.""SK Murthy, a public policy researcher from Mysuru, said the govt should release the raw data and explain the methodology used for the survey. ""Transparency is key. If there are errors, let these be debated in the open. Independent data auditors should be brought in as there is still scope for making corrections,"" he said.Siddaramaiah declared recently that 95% of report was accurate. ""Without examining it, one should not dismiss it as unscientific.""The govt might set up a panel to re-examine the urban data. ""We are open to suggestions. Our aim is not to divide but to deliver welfare based on evidence,"" said a senior official in the chief minister's office.State BJP president BY Vijayendra said the Congress govt may have ""wasted over Rs 150 crore"" on an exercise whose credibility had been called into question by its own ministers. ""Many communities, including Jains and backwards classes, are contradicting the numbers shown in the report. BJP has repeatedly stated this survey was not carried out properly.CM Siddaramaiah contested reports of dissent within his cabinet over the caste survey report. ""It was discussed in cabinet yesterday. The data was incomplete, so next discussion is scheduled for May 2. Nobody has opposed the report,"" he said.","The karnataka state commission for backward classes started its socio-economic and educational survey in 2015.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab and Haryana high court has upheld the conviction of seven villagers from Punjab's Nawanshahr for attempting to swindle land by forging the will of a soldier who vanished during World War 2, reports Ajay Sura.Harbans Singh , a native of Sheikhupur Bagh village, disappeared after 1943, prompting his wife Joginder Kaur to have him officially declared dead to claim his benefits as a legal heir. Decades later, the group of villagers falsely claimed Harbans had lived with one of them and passed away leaving a will, aiming to claim his property.As they failed to prove the presence of the soldier, HC upheld their conviction and three-year term awarded by the trial court. ""If it is proved that a person has not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of him if he was alive, then the burden of proof that he is still alive would rest upon the person who affirms the factum of his living,"" Justice Mahabir Singh Sindhu said in his April 7 order.HC directed the seven, who were out on bail, to surrender before a Nawanshahr court within six weeks and undergo the remaining part of their sentence. Joginder, on whose complainant the FIR was filed in 1996, died during court proceedings, as did some of the accused.Joginder married Harbans in 1941, and he joined the Army about a year later. She never saw or heard from him after 1943. Harbans owned over 50 kanal (approximately 6.2 acres) of land. With no kids and advanced in age, she lived with one Bawa Singh, who supported her.""The offence is serious, inasmuch as, the petitioners committed forgery with a soldier who left his wife, house, and property to serve in WW2. Taking advantage of his absence, petitioners opened a fake bank account in the name of Harbans Singh, manufactured a forged will dated April 7, 1992, and thereafter, procured a false entry of his death. Thus, in the opinion of this court, petitioners do not deserve any leniency on the quantum of sentence,"" HC held while dismissing a plea by the seven against their conviction.According to the prosecution, the seven villagers forged a bank passbook of Joginder's husband, entered a false death record, concocted a will through impersonation, and manipulated revenue officials to fraudulently transfer land ownership. They were sentenced by the lower court in July 2010 and their conviction was later upheld by a sessions court. They later appealed in HC.","Harbans singh disappeared after 1943, prompting his wife joginder kaur to have him officially declared dead to claim his benefits.
