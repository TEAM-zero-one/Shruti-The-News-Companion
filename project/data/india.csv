"Pocso court fixes age as per school record, not medical reports",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pocso-court-fixes-age-as-per-school-record-not-medical-reports/articleshow/123007538.cms,"BAREILLY: Pocso court judge Devendra Nath Singh sentenced a man to 10 years of rigorous punishment for kidnaping and raping a minor girl in 2011. The court relied on educational documents to determine that the survivor was a minor (15 years and 15 days) at the time of the crime though the medical reports had suggested her radiological age was around 19 years.The court cited the Supreme Court's judgment in the Mahadev Vs State of Maharashtra (2013) case and said the medical report for determining the age was considered only when educational documents of the survivor were not available. In this case, the court admitted the TC (transfer certificate) of a govt primary school while rejecting the bone density test of the girl.The girl was kidnapped from Lakhimpur Kheri in March 2011 by a car driver and kept confined in a house in Lucknow for nearly two months and forced her to have physical relationship with him. After the girl was rescued by police, she said in her statement that she was repeatedly raped by the accused at gunpoint and was forced to marry him at a temple.ADGC Sanjay Singh said, ""The minor girl's father had lodged a police complaint at Isanagar police station after she went missing. After she was recovered, the accused was booked under IPC sections 376 (rape), 363 (abduction), and 366 (abduction of a woman to compel her marriage).""""The accused claimed not guilty and said the girl eloped with him willingly, but the girl stated she was confined in a house and raped on multiple occasions. The medical report also confirmed sexual assault. The incident was reported before the Pocso Act was enacted,"" said the ADGC. While passing the order on Tuesday, the court also imposed a fine of Rs 16,000 on the convict, of which Rs 10,000 will be awarded to survivor as compensation.","The girl was kidnapped from lakhimpur kheri in march 2011 by a car driver.

"'How do you plan to hold Senthil trial,' SC asks Tamil Nadu",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-do-you-plan-to-hold-senthil-trial-sc-asks-tamil-nadu/articleshow/123007329.cms,"NEW DELHI: Observing that trial in cash-for-job scam, in which former Tamil Nadu minister V Senthil Balaji is being prosecuted, could be the most mammoth trial in the country with over 2,000 accused, Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the state to place before it a prosecutorial plan on how to go about the case and said that it may consider appointing a special public prosecutor in the case.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi asked the state to submit a complete list of accused and witnesses in the corruption cases and said ""with over 2,000 accused and 500 witnesses it will be the most populated trial of India. A small courtroom of the trial court will not suffice and a cricket stadium will be needed to even mark the presence of the accused.""It asked govt why it did not filter accused on the basis of their marginal or prime culpability in the case. It said that the bribe givers, though technically also committed a crime, are effectively victims and prosecuting such a large number of people would cause extreme inordinate delay.""We want to know what your prosecutorial plan is. It seems to be a very rudderless ship with 2,000 odd accused, 500 odd witnesses. How would you achieve clubbing? We gave a suggestion that you see the accused with regards to their degree of marginal culpability and prime culpability? Why should it come from us? This thought never crossed your prosecutor's mind?,"" the bench asked the state govt.Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for the complainants, said that the prosecution should identify the prime accused namely the minister, his brother, his personal assistant, and others who solicited bribes and rest be treated as witnesses.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, for the state govt, opposed the appointment of a special public prosecutor as the court had already rejected the prayer and told the court to hear him before making its mind on appointing SPP in the case. He said that there had been no allegations against the present public prosecutor who is discharging his duties.The bench, however, said that appointment of SPP would dispel any wrong public perception about the trial as a former minister and bureaucrats were involved in the case.""He is a powerful politician. Nothing wrong with being a powerful politician. Somebody who has public support. Only concern is that in a case where some person who has held the position of the minister there are some bureaucrats or other affluent people who are facing trial there is a public perception that a prosecution through the govt appointed public prosecutor may not alone be able to do justice,"" the bench said.",Justices surya kant and joymalya bagchi asked the state to submit a complete list of accused and witnesses in the corruption cases.

"Person tailgating liable for accident if it occurs, says SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/person-tailgating-liable-for-accident-if-it-occurs-says-sc/articleshow/123006985.cms,"NEW DELHI: Apply emergency brakes or trail a moving vehicle too closely at your own risk as Supreme Court has said that using brakes all of a sudden in the middle of a road or not maintaining sufficient distance from a running vehicle make a person liable for an accident if it occurs.While adjudicating a motor accident claim in an accident involving a bike, a car and a bus in which bike rider collided with the four wheeler and was hit by a truck after falling down resulting in 100% physical disability, a bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and Aravind Kumar found fault with all three who were driving vehicles. The court said that the car driver was at fault for suddenly applying brakes in the middle of the road and the biker also committed a mistake as he was not maintaining safe distance from the car and also the bus driver whose negligence resulted in grievous injury and led to the amputation of a leg of the biker's.The court rejected the plea of the car insurer which contended that the biker had hit the moving car from behind and the car driver was not liable. The car owner had said that he had suddenly applied the brakes as his wife was pregnant and she had a vomiting sensation at that time, a justification which was rejected by the court.Examining the role of all three drivers, the court said that the biker, who was an engineering student and lost his one leg, was also liable for contributory negligence but only to the extent of 20% whereas the car driver and bus driver are liable for negligence to the extent of 50% and 30% respectively.The tribunal had exonerated the car driver and determined the negligence of the biker and the bus driver in the ratio of 20:80.The court awarded a compensation of Rs 1.14 crore to the biker but deducted 20% from it due to his contributory role in the accident. It said that since both the offending vehicles (car as well as the bus) were insured at the time of the accident, the liability for the negligence of the car driver and bus driver shall be borne by the insurer.",Supreme court finds fault with all three who were driving vehicles.

Yashwant Varma’s conduct doesn’t inspire confidence: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/yashwant-varmas-conduct-doesnt-inspire-confidence-sc/articleshow/123006468.cms,"CJI has duty towards nation: SC on Varma case

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday reserved its verdict on Justice Yashwant Varma's petition challenging both an in-house inquiry committee report recording his alleged complicity in the case regarding discovery of sacks of cash from his official residence and the then CJI Sanjiv Khanna's recommendation for his removal from judgeship.Rejecting his plea for a week's adjournment right at the start of the hearing, a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Augustine G Masih appeared to show the judge and his counsel, Kapil Sibal, the 'writing on the wall' with pithy observations, including ""your conduct does not inspire confidence"", during the more than hour-long hearing.When Sibal said the principles of natural justice were sacrificed at the altar of the inquiry process and that the Allahabad high court judge was pronounced guilty through media trial because of a video of burning cash had been uploaded on SC website, the bench said that might not have been prudent, but ""putting it on the website does not mean everything (the probe process, its report and the ex-CJI's recommendation for initiation of removal proceedings) got so vitiated that you will go scot-free"".The bench told Varma, ""You are a judge, and you know your case. We don't want to spill something right now. Let Parliament decide.""On the challenge to the constitutionality of the CJI's recommendation for stripping Justice Yashwant Varma of judgeship, the bench said, ""The CJI is not a post office. As the leader of the judiciary, he has a duty and responsibility towards the nation. If based on material before him, he felt that a recommendation was needed, he has the authority to do so.""Sibal said the in-house committee's recommendation to remove the judge when the panel had not adjudged him guilty of owning the cash had resulted in the govt getting involved in the removal motion and politicisation of an otherwise purely constitutional process.The bench disagreed and further said that Section 3(2) of Judges Protection Act, 1985, empowered the SC and HCs to take decisions to deal with judges as the situation warranted and the in-house procedure, which was non-punitive, was a process to identify the black sheep among judges through a preliminary inquiry, result of which would enable the CJI to take an appropriate decision.The Justice Datta-led bench turned to the conduct of Justice Varma and asked, ""Why did the judge not raise the violation of principles of natural justice after the committee submitted its report? Why did you not approach the SC to remove the video from its website if it fuelled a media trial and affected your innocence? You could have raised these issues much before. You knew that in-house committee report could lead to a recommendation for your removal. But you waited for the result of in-house inquiry. Once it turned out to be unfavourable, you decided to challenge it.""Sibal said the composition of the inquiry committee would comprise of an SC judge, an HC chief justice and a jurist. ""With the CJI recommending removal, will the committee be able to go beyond the CJI's recommendation?"" he asked.The bench said, ""The CJI has acted as per the in-house procedure which has been upheld in three judgments of the SC, and is the law of the land. We have to send a message to society that what is contemplated in the in-house procedure has been followed by the CJI.""","Cji has duty towards nation: sc on varma case.

We want unity. Threatening and harassing people is not our way.""Alleging a bigger game plan Banerjee said, ""Assam govt is sending NRC notices to a tribal family in Alipurduar.

His earlier stint at Jawaharlal Nehru University , where he was part of the Centre for the Study of Discrimination and Exclusion, sharpened his engagement with themes of social justice and subaltern narratives.His scholarly compass- spanning democracy, popular culture, Dalit assertion, and anthropological history - experts said, aligns closely with the ethos TISS has long embodied. But the institute's foundations were quietly strengthened during the interim stewardship of Prof Manoj Tiwari. In his dual role as director of IIM-Mumbai and acting vice-chancellor, Prof Tiwari ensured that the long-pending Memorandum of Agreement was formally drafted, placing the institute on firmer administrative ground.He also initiated a sweeping accreditation drive across departments, a move that helped elevate the institute's national ranking.Perhaps more tangibly, he is credited with unlocking and disbursing Rs 14 crore in arrears, some of which were pending for years-an intervention that restored both morale and momentum.

But a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and N K Singh said that summons issued by a court is a judicial act, whereas a notice issued by the investigating agency is an executive act and the procedure prescribed for a judicial act cannot be read into the procedure prescribed for an executive act.The court clarified that the issue of liberty is involved in the case of police summon as the person can be arrested for non-compliance of summon and in such cases it is appropriate that such a notice be served in person on the accused, and not through the mode of electronic communication.

"After over 40 years, India issues tender for Sawalkote project as Indus treaty remains in abeyance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-over-40-years-india-issues-tender-for-sawalkote-project-as-indus-treaty-remains-in-abeyance/articleshow/123004488.cms,"SRINAGAR: India, taking advantage of its keeping in abeyance the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, floated on Wednesday international tenders for construction of the Sawalkote Hydroelectric Project on the Chenab river a little over 40 years after it was conceived.The project, designated by govt as one of national importance, had suffered long delays due to objections from Pakistan under the Indus Waters Treaty framework as well as multiple regulatory and administrative hurdles, including compensation issues involving 13 affected villages, relocation of the Army transit camp in Ramban, and forest land within the project area requiring clearances and compensation under environmental regulations.he National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) initiated on Wednesday the tendering process for the power project, located near Sidhu village in J&K’s Ramban district. The last date for submission of online bids is Sept 10. It invited international bids on a competitive bidding basis for planning, design, and engineering works for the 1,856 MW project. The last date for submission of online bids is Sept 10.Construction of the Sawalkote project is a major strategic development aimed at optimising India’s use of Indus waters while the treaty with Pakistan remains in abeyance. The 1960 treaty had given India control of the Beas, Ravi and Sutlej rivers, and Pakistan the Indus, Chenab and Jhelum, with India being allowed a portion of waters from the “western rivers (those under Pakistan control)” for certain uses.J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah, who is also power minister, told TOI the project is of great significance and that he hoped it would finally take off. “The project was originally conceived in the 1980s, but it was shelved after some time. In 1996, Dr Farooq Abdullah attempted to revive it with the help of a Norwegian consortium but that effort didn’t succeed. Later, during my previous tenure, we tried to initiate the project again, but it encountered certain hurdles,” Omar said, adding that it was completely shelved during the tenure of the Mufti Mohammad Sayeed govt.Ramban MLA Arjun Singh Raju was the first to announce Wednesday’s development, calling it a landmark moment. “Sawalkote power project is the biggest in the country. Once completed, it will benefit not just Jammu and Kashmir, but the entire nation. I think it is a historical moment,” he said, adding, “And the credit goes to chief minister Omar Abdullah, who fought relentlessly for this project,” he added.The run-of-river project is estimated to cost Rs 22,704.8 crore and will be developed in two stages.“All issues have now been sorted out,” Raju said, adding that NHPC has also secured relaxation on the water cess, which had earlier delayed progress.Earlier this month, the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) granted “in-principle” approval for the diversion of 847 hectares of forest land for the construction of the Sawalkote project.Conceived in 1984, the Sawalkote project, sources said it was given to NHPC in 1985. In 1997 it was given back to Jammu Kashmir State Power Development Corporation (JKSPDC) for execution. Sources said approximately Rs 430 crore was spent by JKSPDC on “enabling infrastructure” around the project. But no work had started on the main project. Then, in 2021, an MoU was signed with NHPC to revive and implement the project under the build-own-operate-transfer model.","The project, designated by govt as one of national importance, had suffered long delays due to objections from pakistan.

J&K rains: Two teachers washed away in flash floods in Ramban; Amarnath Yatra suspended,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-rains-two-teachers-washed-away-in-flash-floods-in-ramban-amarnath-yatra-suspended/articleshow/123004275.cms,"JAMMU: Two govt teachers from Udhampur lost their lives after being swept away by flash floods in Jammu’s Ramban district, while heavy rains prompted the authorities to announce the closure of all govt and private schools in Poonch and Rajouri districts on Wednesday. Inclement weather in J&K also forced the Amarnath Yatra to be halted temporarily for the second time this month.Jagdev Singh and Sanjay Kumar, both residents of Ghordi village of Ramnagar in Udhampur district, were on a motorcycle when they were presumably caught in the flash floods on Nathatop-Sanasar road. The deceased were serving as govt teachers in Udhampur, and were in Ramban to attend a three-day training session at District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) in Kud, which began on July 29.Cops at Patnitop police received information about a motorcycle lying on the roadside at Jalebi Morh nallah. Police teams were joined by SDRF personnel in a search/rescue operation along the seasonal rivulet, and found two bodies about 150 and 300 metres from the link road.The duo was last seen by the locals on Tuesday evening when it was raining heavily in the Sanasar, and were possibly carried away by the strong currents of a mountain stream due to a sudden surge of water, police said.With the MeT department predicting heavy to moderate rains in many parts of J&K over the next three days, the school education board postponed class 12 examinations scheduled for Wednesday in both J&K and Ladakh, and said the revised date would be announced soon.In view of the adverse weather, the authorities on Wednesday suspended the Amarnath Yatra from both Pahalgam and Baltal routes. Jammu divisional commissioner Rakesh Kumar said since the movement of pilgrims from base camps was affected, it had been decided that “no convoy movement shall be allowed towards the base camps Baltal and Nunwan from Bhagwati Nagar, Jammu, on July 31”.The annual pilgrimage was earlier paused on July 17 following a warning of heavy rain in many parts of J&K.","Jagdev singh and sanjay kumar were on a motorcycle when they were presumably caught in the flash floods.
