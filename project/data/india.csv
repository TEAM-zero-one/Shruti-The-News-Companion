Agencies pass the buck after wetland vanishes

PANAJI: Less than two months ago, the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority, chaired by IAS officer Arun Kumar Mishra, brushed aside a report by its three-member committee on ""gross violations"" against the owner of the property on which the nightclub Birch by Romeo Lane stood, a British citizen named Surinder Kumar Khosla, and dropped proceedings against him. Khosla had leased the land to Birch by Romeo Lane.The committee, which included an expert and two members of the coastal authority, said there were ""alleged gross illegal constructions resulting in violations of CRZ notification 2011"" and recommended that it should be deliberated by the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) at its meeting and taken up for ""further discussion"".But without discussing or deliberating, coastal authority turned a blind eye to ""gross violations"" report and dropped proceedings on Oct 9 ""There is no violation of CRZ notification in as much as the structures in question fall beyond CRZ area of the creek/ river,"" the coastal authority said, adding it does not have jurisdiction in areas not declared or notified as CRZ (Coastal Regulatory Zone).After the inspection, the committee had reported that the ""RCC permanent structure is constructed fully into the water body"" and there were neither permissions nor NOCs from authorities concerned for the construction of a concrete structure.The committee found a RCC ground-plus-one structure ""in roughly hexagon shape"", which ""is erected in water body... ground floor is used as kitchen and storeroom area"", and the first floor, with coconut leaf roofing, is used as a restaurant.It was on the first floor that a fire broke out Saturday, killing 25 people, after electric firecrackers hit the ceiling as a belly dancer and her troupe performed.But the coastal authority, chaired by Mishra who is now posted in Delhi, dismissed the report and accepted the argument that ""there is no environmental cause"".The Arpora-Nagoa panchayat had on Oct 31, 1996 issued an NOC to construct a restaurant, staff quarters, compound wall, and later another NOC on Aug 12, 2004 to renovate the restaurant.Despite the committee attaching a Google image and the coastal zone management plan (CZMP) extract, which showed the alleged violations, the coastal authority noted ""that the CZMP for Goa had already been notified. The CZM indicates that the subject matter ground-plus-one RCC structure is outside the CRZ area"".The coastal authority report was the consequence of a complaint by Pradeep Ghadi Amonkar and Sunil Divkar Shetye on Dec 21, 2023, regarding illegal construction of Birch by Romeo Lane.New Delhi: Who is responsible for a wetland near Wazirabad disappearing? The National Green Tribunal is no closer to finding an answer despite the the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and the Central Pollution Control Board submitting their replies.On July 16, 2025, The Times of India had reported that the wetland had been filled up using inert waste from the Bhalswa landfill. The report highlighted that the Jharoda pond, which supported rich plant and bird life until 2023, had been buried under inert waste allegedly brought from the Bhalswa landfill..Taking suo motu cognizance of the report titled 'Find it if you can. Wetland near Wazirabad vanished under inert waste', the tribunal had issued notice to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Delhi Development Authority (DDA), the North district magistrate, and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) seeking an explanation on the matter. Only MCD and CPCB have responded so far, with both shifting blame to other agencies.In its submissions MCD said it was the responsibility of the private concessionaire appointed to flatten the Bhalswa landfill to ensure the inert material was disposed of correctly. It also said that the site belongs to DDA.In its reply, MCD said it was not ""dumping any form of waste at any wetland in the Wazirabad and Timarpur areas"". ""The said site, where it has been alleged that waste is being dumped, is owned by Delhi Development Authority,"" it said.The civic body further stated that it was merely following a 2019 order by the tribunal to dispose of 30 lakh MT of legacy waste from the Bhalswa landfill site, while adding that it received a request from DDA to facilitate the supply of bioremediated inert material on May 24, 2023. It added that the agency was neither involved in the process of identification of the site nor in the decision-making process.The DDA order shared by MCD said, ""this office permits to supply inert and C&D material at DDA vacant low-lying area at both sides of the Marginal Bandh at Jharoda Majra, Burari.""CPCB, meanwhile, said it had issued directions in 2021 under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, to all the State Pollution Control Boards and the Pollution Control Committees for the enforcement of provisions of Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.""DPCC shall monitor and ensure compliance with the directions issued... DPCC shall also ensure enforcement of provisions of the SWM Rules 2016 by the concerned local authorities in Delhi,"" stated CPCB in a submission dated October 27, made available on Dec 9.","Goa coastal zone management authority dropped proceedings against nightclub owner.

107 oppn MPs submit notice to remove Madras HC judge over lamp-lighting order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/107-oppn-mps-submit-notice-to-remove-madras-hc-judge-over-lamp-lighting-order/articleshow/125879677.cms,"Over 100 opposition MPs have submitted a notice to the Lok Sabha Speaker seeking the removal of Madras High Court Justice GR Swaminathan. They accuse him of misconduct and bias in a recent order concerning a lamp lighting at a temple near a dargah in Tamil Nadu.

Oppn accuses Madras HC judge of showing 'undue favouritism'

As many as 107 MPs, including those from Congress, DMK and Samajwadi Party, signed the application which accuses Justice Swaminathan of misconduct, saying his functioning has raised questions over ""impartiality, transparency and secular nature"" of the judiciary.One of the grounds cited in the notice by the opposition against the Madras HC judge is ""deciding cases on the basis of particular political ideology and against secular principles of Indian Constitution"".DMK MP Kanimozhi handed over the notice to Birla. She was joined by Priyanka Gandhi and Gaurav Gogoi of Congress and Akhilesh Yadav of SP, among others.The judge is also accused of showing ""undue favouritism"" to a senior advocate and lawyers from a particular community. Supriya Sule of NCP(SP) and Asaduddin Owaisi of AIMIM were also among the signatories.At least 100 MPs are required to support a motion to remove a judge, and it is now for Birla to study the grounds on which they have sought the motion for his removal and verify the signatories before he decides on admitting the notice.The judgment has sparked a political row, with DMK raising the issue in Lok Sabha last week. Party MP TR Baalu accused BJP of trying to spark communal tensions in the state, where elections are due in a few months.Union minister and BJP MP L Murugan had hit back, accusing the state govt of denying devotees their right to worship.Baalu's criticism of Justice Swaminathan in Lok Sabha for owing allegiance to a ""particular ideology"" had drawn a sharp response from govt, with Union minister Kiren Rijiju emphasising that he cannot cast aspersions on the judiciary.Hearing a plea, Justice GR Swaminathan had on Dec 1 held that Arulmighu Subramania Swamy temple was duty-bound to light the lamp at the 'deepathoon', a stone lamp pillar located on the Thiruparankundram hillock close to the dargah.When authorities did not allow it, the single bench passed another order on Dec 3 permitting devotees themselves to light the lamp and directed Central Industrial Security Force to ensure their protection.However, the state govt did not implement the order and has moved Supreme Court challenging the verdict. The Madurai bench of the high court had last week dismissed an appeal filed by Madurai district collector and city police commissioner.","107 mps, including those from congress, dmk and samajwadi party, signed the application.

"EC can't determine voter's citizenship, but surely inquire into it: Supreme Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-cant-determine-voters-citizenship-but-surely-inquire-into-it-supreme-court/articleshow/125879660.cms,"The Supreme Court clarified that while the Election Commission cannot definitively determine citizenship, it can inquire about it if doubts arise regarding voters. The apex court emphasized that Indian citizenship is a constitutional prerequisite for voting, not merely a matter of residence and age. This ruling supports the EC's stance on verifying voter eligibility.

If it has doubts, EC can probe person's citizenship, says SC

The opposition's stand that EC cannot determine citizenship has been a common thread running through the arguments of a large number of politicians and NGOs represented by advocates Kapil Sibal, A M Singhvi, Prashant Bhushan, Shadan Farasat and Md Nizamuddin Pasha.EC has no jurisdiction to engage in determination of citizenship of a voter as that is the task of govt or Foreigners Tribunal. All of them argued that according to Representation of the People Act, if a person has proof of residence and is over 18, and gives a self-declaration that he is a citizen of India, then EC has no power to inquire into citizenship and delete him from the voters' list.On Tuesday, a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi responded, saying, ""EC does not claim that it has the power to determine citizenship of a person or declare him as a foreigner. But, if it has doubts about the citizenship of a person registered as a voter or seeking inclusion of name as a voter, it can surely inquire into it.""""The first and foremost pre-condition for inclusion as a voter is that he/she must be a citizen of India. Given the constitutional and statutory powers conferred on EC, can it not undertake an inquisitorial exercise to find out who are doubtful citizens? That is included in the constitutional task of superintendence of elections,"" the bench said, in what marked an endorsement of EC's own stance on the issue.Farasat argued when a statutory procedure was provided for determination of citizenship, EC had no jurisdiction to usurp that process. SC said, ""To argue that a person required only proof of residence and age for inclusion in a voter list without proof of citizenship would be a misnomer. Proof of residence and age are statutory requirements. But citizenship is a constitutional requirement.""""Take a hypothetical example of an illegal migrant residing in India for more than a decade and more than 18 years of age. Will he be counted as a citizen to be included in the voter list? To argue that citizenship is to be presumed when residential and age criteria are met will be wrong ...,"" it said.Farasat said, ""The danger of illegal migrants getting into voters' lists is far less compared to mass exclusion of voters in the name of identifying non-citizens."" SC said, "" Can it be said that by asking for documentary proof, it is attempting to determine citizenship of a person?""","Ec has no jurisdiction to engage in determination of citizenship of a voter as that is the task of govt or foreigners tribunal. Opponents argued that according to representation of the people act, if a person has proof of residence and is over 18, then ec has no power to inquire into citizenship.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125879660,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1438359,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
"Kids as young as 11 dabbling in drugs, shows 10-city survey",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kids-as-young-as-11-dabbling-in-drugs-shows-10-city-survey/articleshow/125878454.cms,"A nationwide school survey reveals alarming drug experimentation among Indian children, with initiation as early as 11 and an average age of 12.9. One in seven students has tried psychoactive substances, with opioids and cannabis prevalent. Experts warn of easy access and emotional distress driving this trend, urging early intervention and parental vigilance.

NEW DELHI: A major school survey across 10 Indian cities has revealed that children are experimenting with drugs far earlier than expected, with the average age of initiation just 12.9 years and some starting as young as 11. The findings, published in the National Medical Journal of India this month, show that one in seven school students tried a psychoactive substance at least once.The study surveyed 5,920 students aged around 14.7 years across Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Lucknow, Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Imphal, Jammu, Dibrugarh and Ranchi. It found 15.1% had used a substance in their lifetime, 10.3% in the past year, and 7.2% in the past month. After tobacco (4%) and alcohol (3.8%), the most commonly used substances were opioids (2.8%), cannabis (2%) and inhalants (1.9%), with most opioid use linked to non-prescribed pharmaceutical pills.The multi-city study was led by Dr Anju Dhawan, chief of National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre, AIIMS Delhi, in collaboration with medical colleges in Chandigarh, Dibrugarh, Lucknow, Bengaluru, Srinagar, Imphal, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Ranchi.Substance use rose sharply with age. Students in classes XI-XII were twice as likely to have used substances compared to Class VIII. Boys reported higher tobacco and cannabis use, while girls showed higher inhalant and pharmaceutical opioid use. Over half the students said they would hide drug use if asked, indicating that actual prevalence could be higher.The survey found a clear link between substance use and emotional distress: 31% of past-year users showed high psychological difficulty scores compared with 25% of non-users, with marked differences in conduct issues, hyperactivity and emotional symptoms.Against this backdrop, Dr Achal Bhagat, senior consultant psychiatrist and psychotherapist at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, says the early age of initiation is an urgent warning. He notes that easy access and unaddressed emotional distress are driving children toward substances, even as the adolescent brain remains highly vulnerable to lasting harm from inhalants, opioids and cannabis. He points to a worrying rise in substance use among girls, often linked to discreet self-medication, and urges parents to watch for mood shifts, withdrawal, falling grades and secrecy. With only 1% of young users seeking help, he calls for stronger school mental-health support and open family conversations to prevent early experimentation from hardening into addiction.Family and peer influence also played a strong role, with 40% reporting tobacco or alcohol use at home and users far more likely to have peers who consume substances. Researchers say interventions must begin much earlier - ideally before middle school - to delay first use and prevent later addiction.The authors say the findings offer the clearest picture yet of adolescent substance use in India and stress the need for urgent school-based prevention, early identification and structured support before experimentation becomes entrenched.","One in seven students has tried a psychoactive substance at least once.

BENGALURU: A 25-year-old Bengaluru resident, Mohammed Ishaq, was among those who lost their lives in the tragedy early Sunday morning.Ishaq, a private firm employee and data analyst at a bank, lived in Ashwath Nagar on Thanisandra Main Road. He was the son of businessman Mohammed Hussain and is survived by his parents and a younger sister.According to relatives, Ishaq had spoken to his father just hours before the tragedy, sharing how he and his friends were enjoying a bachelor-party trip in Goa. He had travelled with five friends, one of whom was getting married.An acquaintance of the family said Ishaq and his friends initially managed to exit the club after noticing the fire, but Ishaq allegedly went back inside to retrieve his mobile phone. He may have died due to the stampede or cardiac arrest; his body showed only minor burns. Police informed the family that Ishaq died in the stampede while exiting the club.Ishaq’s body arrived in Bengaluru on Monday morning via a flight from Goa International Airport in Dabolim. Ishaq’s father received initial news of the incident early Sunday and later confirmation of his son’s death.","Mohammed ishaq, 25, was among those who lost their lives in the tragedy early sunday morning.

A tragedy that cracked the façade

GOA: Within three hours of the inferno that tore through Birch by Romeo Lane in Goa’s Arpora — killing 25 people during a packed Saturday-night performance — owners Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra slipped out of the country through Delhi airport.By 5.30am Sunday, the brothers were airborne, headed to Phuket on IndiGo flight 6E-1073, Goa DGP Alok Kumar revealed on Monday, calling their swift exit “a clear attempt to evade investigation”.Even as Saurabh posted a sombre message on social media expressing “profound grief” and “unwavering solidarity” with victims’ families, the Bureau of Immigration issued a LookOut Circular for both brothers. Goa Police, coordinating with Interpol, says it now wants them in custody “at the earliest”.Also read: The 'burning' Luthra empire Goa police on Tuesday issued a blue corner notice through Interpol, aiming to track, identify, and provisionally detain the brothers while extradition proceedings are considered.A Goa police team reached Delhi on Sunday armed with an arrest warrant, searched the Luthras’ residences and offices — but found nothing. Hours later, immigration authorities in Mumbai confirmed the truth: the brothers had bolted.Delhi Police’s crime branch detained senior Romeo Lane executive Bharat Kohli from north Delhi and handed him to Goa Police on transit remand. Another Delhi-based partner, Ajay Gupta, is now on the radar.Meanwhile, four arrested Birch staffers — chief general manager Rajiv Modak, gate manager Priyanshu Thakur, bar manager Rajveer Singhania and general manager Vivek Singh — were remanded to six days' custody. Three suspended Goa government officials have also been summoned.Investigators say electric firecrackers, set off during a belly-dance performance, shot into the club’s wooden ceiling, triggering the blaze that ripped through the first-floor structure packed with 150 guests.To the Luthras, their empire was a decade-long dream that began in Delhi’s Hudson Lane with Mama’s Buoi — a cosy student-favourite.But it was Romeo Lane that turned them into nightlife royalty. What began as a modest Civil Lines spot exploded into a roaring, post-Covid success in Vagator, Goa, drawing tourists with sea views, fire dancers, Bollywood nights and big-budget spectacle.Their brand became so coveted that malls from Indore and Nagpur to Agra and Dehradun queued up to house a Romeo Lane outlet. Developers offered to cover construction. Franchisees paid hefty fees and royalties. Expansion was relentless: 25+ outlets in India, one in Dubai, and nearly 25 more in the works.Behind the scenes, Saurabh was the flamboyant, aggressive face; Gaurav, the quieter engineer-turned-operator. Their paralysed father, Vijay Luthra, remained the family anchor.But rapid growth came with strain. Franchisees complained of being left unattended after signing expensive contracts. Several outlets allegedly suffered losses. Industry insiders say the empire ballooned faster than the brothers could control.Local panchayat authorities have now flagged major violations at Birch — a property the brothers touted as ""India’s first island bar"".The outlet, functional since March 2024, reportedly lacked key safety clearances.Questions rage: Why were these not flagged earlier? Who allowed a kitchen in the basement? Why did enforcement wake up only after 25 people died?In Delhi, murmurs have grown louder. Some franchise partners say they may discard the Romeo Lane brand name entirely. Restaurateurs say the brothers owe the industry — and the families of the dead — an in-person explanation, not a social media statement.From a brand that once epitomised India’s booming nightlife, Romeo Lane now stands at a precipice — its future hostage to an escape in the night, a trail of unanswered questions, and a tragedy that India won’t forget soon.","Romeo lane owners saurabh and gaurav luthra slipped out of the country through delhi airport.

'No Link To Bengal': Amit Shah's Fiery Speech on Vande Mataram, Blames Nehru, Indira of Sabotage

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday was seen having a meal with his parliament colleagues in the Parliament canteen.Shah was joined by Union MoS Nityanand Rai, Union minsiter Kiren Rijiju and BJP MP Anil Baluni.In the clip, the leaders could be seen having Indian cuisine over some seemingly light-hearted discussion.Earlier in the day, initiating the debate in Rajya Sabha, Amit Shah said the division of ' Vande Mataram ' song for ""politics of appeasement"" led to partition of India.He slammed Opposition for linking the debate on 150 years of the national song with the upcoming West Bengal elections.Shah said Vande Mataram was the ""mantra"" that awakened India's cultural nationalism, and remains as relevant today as it was during the freedom struggle.He stressed that the song will remain relevant in the days to come as well, in taking the country towards Viksit Bharat.Shah also attacked Congress for questioning the need for a debate on Vande Mataram, and accused first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru of ""dividing"" the poem and limiting it to two stanzas.""Yesterday some MPs in the Lok Sabha questioned what is the need to discuss Vande Mataram. The need for discussion...wasas relevant when the song was written, during the freedom movement, today, and will be as relevant in 2047 when the Viksit Bharat would be achieved,"" Shah said.""Some people are saying Vande Mataram is being discussed because elections are coming in West Bengal... They are trying to reduce the importance of Vande Mataram by linking it with Bengal elections,"" he said.The home minister urged members to take the spirit of the message of Vande Mataram to the youth of the nation.He said the song was written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay in Bengal, but it spread across the nation, and became the chant for India's freedom struggle.The home minister said the song was written years after India tolerated ""Islamic attacks"", and the British tried to impose a new culture on the country.","Union home minister amit shah seen having a meal with his parliament colleagues in the parliament canteen.

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Tuesday issued a notice to veteran Congress leader Sonia Gandhi over the wrongful inclusion in the 1980-81 electoral rolls.Senior advocate Pavan Narang, appearing for the revisionist Vikas Tripathi, argued that the matter warranted reconsideration as the material placed on record indicated serious irregularities in the manner Sonia Gandhi's name was entered into the electoral roll before she became an Indian citizen.He submitted that ""certain documents must have been forged and falsified to get the name in the electoral roll of 1980,"" emphasising that her name was later deleted and then re-entered in 1983 on the basis of an application filed in January 1983, both instances, according to him, occurring before she acquired citizenship.After considering the submissions, Judge Gogne issued notice to both respondents, including Sonia Gandhi.The revision petition stems from a complaint filed by advocate Vikas Tripathi, which the Magistrate had rejected at the threshold, holding that it lacked legal foundation and relied solely on uncertified photocopies of electoral records from 1980.The Magistrate had also observed that questions of citizenship and electoral rolls fall exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the Election Commission of India, and cannot be adjudicated through a criminal complaint.Meanwhile, Congress MP and Sonia's daughter Priyanka Gandhi Vadra defended her mother claiming the allegations to be ""absolute lie""""Do they have any evidence? This is an absolute lie. She voted only after she became a citizen (of India). I don't know why they are after her, even though she is about to turn 80. She has dedicated her whole life to serving the nation. She should be spared at her age now,"" Gandhi said.The matter is now listed for further hearing on January 6, when the Sessions Court will continue examining the challenge to the Magistrate's order dismissing the complaint at the threshold.","A delhi court on tuesday issued a notice to veteran congress leader sonia gandhi over the wrongful inclusion in the 1980-81 electoral rolls.

NEW DELHI: In a rare decision aimed at facilitating the education of a minor girl, Supreme Court on Monday approved issuance of an SC certificate based on the 'Adi Dravida' caste of her mother, who is married to a non-SC person, even though it is yet to adjudicate a bunch of petitions challenging the norm that a child inherits their father's caste.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi refused to entertain a challenge to a Madras HC order directing grant of SC caste certificate to the Puducherry girl on the sole ground that her academic career may suffer without it.""We are keeping the question of law open,"" the bench said. However, what the CJI said next could lead to a big debate. He said, ""With changing times, why should a caste certificate be not issued based on the mother's caste?"" This would mean that children born of the marriage of an SC woman with an upper caste man and brought up in upper-caste family environs would also be entitled to an SC certificate.The mother had requested the tahsildar to grant SC certificates to her three children - two daughters and a son - based on her caste certificate as her husband had stayed at her parents' house since their marriage. In her application, she had contended that her parents and grandparents belonged to Hindu Adi Dravida community.The presidential notifications of Mar 5, 1964, and Feb 17, 2002, read with instructions of the Union ministry of home affairs, say that a person's eligibility to get a caste certificate is primarily based on their father's caste as well as his residential status in the state or UT's jurisdiction.In Punit Rai Vs Dinesh Chaudhary [(2003) 8 SCC 204], a case relating to reservation, SC had said that the decisive factor for determination of caste of a person will be the caste of the father as per customary Hindu Law and that in the absence of statutory law, they would inherit their caste from the father and not the mother.In the 2012 judgment in 'Rameshbhai Dabhai Naika vs Gujarat', a two-judge bench of SC ruled, ""The determination of caste of a person born of an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal cannot be determined in complete disregard of attending facts of the case."" It said, ""In an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal, there may be a presumption the child has the caste of the father. This presumption may be stronger in the case where in the inter-caste marriage or a marriage between tribal and non-tribal, the husband belongs to a forward caste.""""But by no means is the presumption conclusive or irrebuttable, and it is open to the child of such marriage to lead evidence to show he/she was brought up by the mother who belonged to SC/ST. By virtue of being the son of a forward caste father, he did not have any advantageous start in life but on the contrary suffered the deprivations, indignities, humiliations and handicaps like any other member of the community to which his/her mother belonged. Additionally, he was always treated as a member of the community to which her mother belonged not only by that community but by people outside the community as well,"" it said.",Sc had earlier held father's caste as decisive factor in caste determination. The puducherry girl's mother is married to a non-sc person. The mother had requested the tahsildar to grant sc certificates to her three children - two daughters and a son.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125853517,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1051879,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

""Instead of defending itself democratically and offering accountability, Congress arrested the Social Media Convener of BJP Telangana,"" they added.Earlier in Hyderabad, the Telangana BJP held a ‘Maha Dharna’, accusing the Congress government of ""betraying"" voters by not implementing the promises made before the state elections.Those who participated included Telangana BJP president N Ramchander Rao, Union minister G Kishan Reddy, MP D K Aruna, Rajya Sabha MP K Laxman, MLAs, MLCs and other senior leaders.

'Leader Is Bulldozing': Kharge, Nadda Lock Horns Over TMC MP's Speech In Rajya Sabha

NEW DELHI: As the Rajya Sabha met on Tuesday for a special discussion marking 150 years of Vande Mataram, the session quickly turned combative. Congress president and Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge used the occasion to criticise BJP ’s ideological predecessors, accusing them of “working for the Britishers,” while Congress leaders were fighting for independence.Kharge said the Congress had played a central role in turning Vande Mataram into a rallying call against British rule. “Your (BJP) history is that you were always against the freedom struggle and patriotic songs. When Mahatma Gandhi started the non-cooperation movement in 1921, lakhs of freedom fighters from the Congress went to jail chanting 'Vande Mataram'. What were you doing? You were working for the Britishers,” he said.He also alleged that PM Modi “leaves no chance to insult Jawaharlal Nehru,” adding, “Home Minister Amit Shah follows the same,"" as quoted by ANI.Earlier in the House, Shah rejected Opposition claims that the discussion was politically timed ahead of the West Bengal assembly elections. He said critics needed to “think afresh” about the legacy and significance of the national song.“Some people believe that because there are elections in Bengal, this discussion is being held. They want to link the glorification of Vande Mataram with the West Bengal elections. I think they need to reconsider their understanding,” he said. Describing the song as an “immortal creation that awakens devotion and duty toward Mother India,” he urged members to view the debate beyond electoral politics.Vande Mataram, first composed independently and later included in Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s 1882 novel Anandamath, completed 150 years on November 7, 2025.",Congress president and leader of opposition mallikarjun kharge used the occasion to criticise bjp ’s ideological predecessors.

After Delhi Blast, Jaishankar Tells SCO Nations India Has Right To Defend Its People Against Terror

NEW DELHI: National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday arrested Dr Bilal Naseer Malla of Baramulla, Jammu and Kashmir, for allegedly destroying evidence linked to last month’s car blast near the Red Fort.His arrest in Delhi marks the eighth made in the case as investigators continue to widen their probe into the deadly attack.According to the NIA, Bilal also played a role in the larger conspiracy behind the November 10 explosion, which killed 15 people and injured several others in the busy Red Fort area. “As per NIA investigations, Bilal had knowingly harboured the deceased accused Umar Un Nabi by providing him logistical support. He is also accused of destruction of evidence related to the terrorist attack,” the agency said in a statement.The blast is being treated as a terrorist strike under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, with investigators linking it to a Jaish-e-Mohammed module involving radicalised young doctors and cross-border handlers.Several others connected to the accused have already been arrested, including a Faridabad resident who allegedly sheltered Umar Un Nabi shortly before the incident.The NIA said it is continuing to work closely with central and state agencies to trace every part of the conspiracy and identify all those involved in planning and executing the attack.","Dr bilal naseer malla of baramulla, jammu and kashmir, arrested for allegedly destroying evidence linked to last month’s car blast near the red fort.

Centre pushes PPP medical colleges nationwide; 11 projects get nod under new funding model,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-pushes-ppp-medical-colleges-nationwide-11-projects-get-nod-under-new-funding-model/articleshow/125825350.cms,"Representative image (ANI Photo)

NEW DELHI: India’s push to expand medical education into underserved districts has entered a new phase, with the Centre revealing in the Lok Sabha that 11 new medical colleges have received in-principle approval under a Public–Private Partnership ( PPP ) model. These colleges will come up by upgrading district hospitals — a shift in strategy aimed at accelerating MBBS seat creation without waiting for full government-backed infrastructure.The projects cleared so far are spread across Jharkhand (Giridih, Dhanbad, Jamtara, Khunti), Arunachal Pradesh (Namsai) and Uttar Pradesh (Baghpat, Mainpuri, Hathras, Kasganj, Mahoba, Hamirpur).The government explained that the model will rely on Viability Gap Funding (VGF) — a financial support mechanism designed to make socially important but commercially unviable projects feasible for private partners. Under the scheme, the Centre may fund up to 30% of the project cost, with states allowed to match this amount. For pilot projects, support can go up to 40% of the cost, plus 25% of operations-and-maintenance expenses for the first five years.In return, States must allow full and free access to district hospital facilities for the attached medical colleges and must provide land on concessional terms — conditions aimed at ensuring that medical education does not dilute public-hospital services.The Lok Sabha reply also stressed that faculty norms, curriculum rules, equipment standards and staffing requirements will remain under the National Medical Commission’s Minimum Standard Requirement (MSR) Regulations, ensuring that PPP colleges follow the same quality benchmarks as government medical colleges.Alongside the PPP push, the government also confirmed that the existing Centrally Sponsored Scheme for upgrading district hospitals into government medical colleges has already sanctioned all 157 planned institutions, including 14 in Madhya Pradesh and two in Maharashtra.While the PPP model is still at an early stage, the approval of 11 projects signals the Centre’s intent to create a parallel pathway for strengthening medical infrastructure, especially in districts that have historically lacked teaching hospitals.The next challenge lies in execution — from faculty recruitment to readiness of hospital facilities — but policymakers say the new structure opens a crucial opportunity to expand medical education faster, in areas that need it most.",India’s push to expand medical education into underserved districts has entered a new phase. 11 new medical colleges have received in-principle approval under a public–private partnership ( ppp ) model.

Partition result of dividing Vande Mataram: Amit Shah

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah asserted Tuesday that had Congress not ""divided"" Vande Mataram , India would not have been partitioned as its concession to the Muslim League over the song in 1937 started the politics of appeasement, which finally led to the country's division.Initiating the discussion in Rajya Sabha on Vande Mataram's 150th anniversary, Shah articulated a muscular concept of cultural nationalism, a founding tenet of BJP and the larger Sangh Parivar, and said Bankim Chandra Chatterjee's composition affirmed the ancient civilisational glory and tradition of worshipping the motherland that suffered from Islamic invasions and British rule.Shah slammed the opposition for belittling Vande Mataram by statements that the discussion was a way to divert attention from pressing issues and gain traction ahead of elections in Bengal.Home minister Amit Shah said it was fitting to pay respect to a song that had stirred patriots for generations and those thinking otherwise needed to revisit their understanding.""For us, India has not just been a geographical entity. We believe it to be a cultural space and treat it as our mother. Lord Ram and Adi Sankara believed in this, and this was what Bankim babu espoused in Vande Mataram,"" Shah said in an apparent refutation of critics of the song's evocation of Goddesses Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswati as marked idolatry and their refusal to sing it.""We do not fear discussing issues. We do not boycott Parliament. If Parliament is not boycotted and allowed to function, then discussion on all issues will take place. We don't have anything to hide,"" he said, noting that when the song completed its 100th anniversary, the country was in the grip of Emergency. Those singing Vande Mataram were jailed, he said.""Look at the situation of Congress, which used to start its sessions with Vande Mataram. But when the debate started in Lok Sabha, both members of the Gandhi family were missing. The opposition to Vande Mataram is in the blood of Congress leadership, from Jawaharlal Nehru to the present-day Congress brass,"" Shah said in a pointed criticism of Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.Shah accused many opposition leaders of not according respect to Vande Mataram and submitted a list to the Rajya Sabha chairman after Congress MP Jairam Ramesh asked him to back his claim. A BJP member will never do this, he added. He said it was only after a proposal by BJP MP Ram Naik that Vande Mataram started being sung in Parliament.Shah said the song became the chant of the freedom struggle despite British attempts to ban it. ""Even though the (British) govt tried to ban it, and people were beaten and jailed for chanting Vande Mataram, it touched people's hearts and spread from Kashmir to Kanyakumari,"" he said, recalling Aurobindo who called it the ""mantra"" of India's awakening.Targeting Congress and Nehru, Shah said the song was divided on its 50th anniversary in 1937. ""That is where appeasement politics started. Many like me believe if Vande Mataram was not divided into two for appeasement politics, India would also not have been partitioned,"" he added.","Home minister amit shah: congress's decision to divide vande mataram in 1937 initiated appeasement politics that ultimately led to india's partition.

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Nishikant Dubey on Tuesday took on Rahul Gandhi over his allegation of electoral malpractices against the govt, saying EVMs were introduced by former PM Rajiv Gandhi to curb poll irregularities, and blamed ""pro-Muslim"" politics of Congress and regional parties for their opposition to SIR, as he cited disproportionate rise in Muslim population in states like West Bengal to back the exercise.Dubey rebutted Gandhi's allegations - including over ""vote chori"" and govt's decisive say in appointment of election commissioners - saying Congress put its favourite bureaucrats in poll bodies and rewarded them with berths and party tickets. As member of the selection committee, the LoP is now part of the process and can file his dissent which was never the case when Congress was in office, he said.Intervening in the discussion on election reforms in the lower House of Parliament, law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal said the special intensive revision of electoral rolls has been held multiple times since 1952 & was necessary to clean up rolls, which change due to migration and rapid urbanisation.Meghwal accused Congress of engaging in ""vote chori"" since the first LS elections, including in the defeat of B R Ambedkar. He emphasised that the Modi govt did not change the law regarding appointment of the CEC and fellow election commissioners, but created a framework following a 2023 SC ruling.Nishikant Dubey said former CEC TN Sheshan was given a Congress ticket to contest against BJP's LK Advani, while another CEC, MS Gill, became a minister in the Manmohan Singh govt after ""favouring"" Sonia Gandhi in the ""office of profit"" row.""They talk of transparency. Congress worker Batuk Singh was made UPSC chairman,"" he said.He said Parliament's select committees dating back to the 60s and 70s recommended SIR and voting machines for reforming polling process, while a joint committee that included MPs from Jana Sangh, BJP's forerunner, favoured in 1972 reducing the voting age to 18 from 21. Rajiv Gandhi implemented this in 1988, and Congress is claiming it to be the biggest polls reform, he said.Batting for SIR, he named a number of districts, including Kolkata and Murshidabad, in poll-bound West Bengal and Jharkhand, and cited 2011 Census data to flag disproportionately high rise in the Muslim population compared to their national growth since independence to claim the presence of Bangladeshi infiltrators.BJP MP Sanjay Jaiswal said Congress did ""vote chori"" by picking Nehru as PM over Sardar Patel, who was favoured by most party units, while Indira Gandhi did it by imposing Emergency.","Cong involved in 'vote chori' since 1952, claim bjp netas.

We will change law & we will find you, Rahul warns ECs

NEW DELHI: Asking why the prime minister and home minister are so keen on deciding who becomes the election commissioner, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi Tuesday alleged that BJP has captured the Election Commission (EC) which is ""colluding"" with the governing party to help it win polls. He also accused the BJP of ""vote chori"" that, he said, is the worst possible unpatriotic act.Rahul said the Modi govt's decision to remove the Chief Justice of India from the collegium that selects election commissioners has given BJP complete control over who becomes the poll watchdog - as the three members of the collegium are PM, HM and leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi. The govt had also changed the law to give ""tremendous gift of immunity"" to election commissioners for their actions, he alleged, while EC laid down that CCTV footage be destroyed after 45 days of polling.While election commissioners got immunity, the poll commission changed the rule to lay down that CCTV footage be destroyed after 45 days of polling - decisions that, LoP Rahul Gandhi alleged, were at the root of ""vote chori"".As he targeted RSS, Rahul said the complete capture of EC was the culmination of the ""project"" executed after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi by Nathuram Godse, referring to the education sector, intelligence agencies and bureaucracy as some other institutions.Rahul said ""our friends"" don't embrace Godse anymore because he is an ""uncomfortable truth"", but Gandhi's killing was ""not where the project ended"".Rahul presented a four-point wish list to govt for reforming the poll process: provide machine-readable voter lists to parties a month before the election, withdraw the order to destroy CCTV footage after 45 days of polling, provide opposition access to ""architecture of EVMs"" and change the law that ""allows EC to get away with what he wants to do"".
