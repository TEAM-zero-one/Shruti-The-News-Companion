NEW DELHI: Emboldened by Penguin’s statement that former Army chief General (retd) M M Naravane’s memoir has not been published yet and the author’s endorsement of the same, BJP on Tuesday demanded an apology from Rahul Gandhi and accused him of making baseless claims that were in violation of not only parliamentary conventions but also the law.Former Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said it is now clear that Rahul Gandhi, “in keeping with his character”, has again spread lies and misled Parliament and the nation..“Penguin has issued a public statement, clearly stating that General Naravane’s memoir has not yet been published in any format.

New Delhi: As the opposition gathered to decide strategy for the upcoming discussion on Budget on Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi faced a unanimous demand from allies that he should start the debate, if only to get back at BJP which had not let him speak for seven days. The demand was led by DMK’s T R Baalu and supported by others. But Rahul resisted.He argued that if he stood up to speak, it would result in objections from the treasury benches. And the ensuing commotion would cost every opposition party the chance to speak. He underlined that all regional parties has important issues to raise, and they should not fall prey to “organised disruptions” of BJP.The move won a few hearts in the room, with an ally-critic of LoP Rahul Gandhi later describing it as a “magnanimous” gesture.The meeting was attended by Congress’ Mallikarjun Kharge, K C Venugopal, Naseer Hussain and Manickam Tagore, Ramgopal Yadav (SP), N K Premachandran (RSP), Sanjay Raut and Arvind Sawant (SS), John Brittas (CPM), PC Gupta (RJD), Shatabdi Roy (TMC), E T Mohd Basheer (IUML), Rajaram Singh (CPI-ML), among others.That was how the plan was clinched, with the party sticking to Shashi Tharoor to initiate the discussion.Gandhi will speak on the Budget on Wednesday.When the India bloc leaders met in Kharge’s chamber to brainstorm on the future course, the allies decided on ending the logjam.If Gandhi is still blocked from speaking, they would submit the planned no-confidence notice against Speaker Om Birla, and then get on with the stalled business.

NEW DELHI: Any hope of normalcy returning to LS was apparently dashed when opposition stepped up their offensive and submitted a notice for the removal of the Speaker. In a twist, it turned out to be the end of a week-long impasse, laying bare faultlines within the opposition as pragmatic voices wanting to be heard on key issues in the House prevailed over those favouring uncompromising rigidity and confrontation.LS functioned normally even though the govt did not agree to the conditions set by Congress: allowing LoP Rahul Gandhi to speak, rectification of the Speaker’s “baseless” claim that he had to request PM not to speak during the debate on motion of thanks to the President for her address in view of plans of Congress’ MPs to do something unprecedented, and a probe into why BJP MP Nishikant Dubey’s mic was not switched off when he attacked Nehru-Gandhi family.The prevailing view within govt was that it had come out better in the battle of wits by not making any concession to the key Congress demand of allowing Rahul to speak first and revoking the suspension of eight MPs to defuse the crisis that had stalled proceedings.What helped the govt defuse the impasse was the keenness among some key regional BJP rivals for LS to function and allow discussion on regional concerns. Bengal and Tamil Nadu, where TMC and DMK are in office, are headed to polls, while political temperature is rising in UP, where Samajwadi Party is the main opposition party, with elections only a year away.While TMC made its differences clear by not signing the notice, MPs from different non-Congress oppn parties suggested many of them did not want the first half of the session to be consumed by the deadlock.Across the aisle, BJP’s allies stood firm with the govt, backing the Speaker and criticising the opposition for targeting a constitutional office.Taking high moral ground, Birla decided not to attend till the notice is disposed of, signalling the matter may be taken up later in the session.",Ls functioned normally even though the govt did not agree to the conditions set by congress.

NEW DELHI: Women MPs from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla , urging him to take strict action against opposition MPs for allegedly committing “heinous acts” inside the House during last week’s proceedings.In their letter, the MPs praised the Speaker for maintaining order and decorum during the discussion on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address on February 4, but accused opposition of creating chaos.""We wish to express our profound gratitude and admiration for the exemplary manner in which you upheld and protected the dignity, decorum, and sanctity of the Lok Sabha during the discussion on the Motion of Thanks on the Honourable President's Address on February 4, 2026. On that day, the entire House, and indeed the entire nation, witnessed one of the most unfortunate and regrettable incidents inside the Lok Sabha chamber,"" the letter stated.Detailing the alleged misconduct, the BJP MPs claimed that opposition MPs disrupted proceedings in an unprecedented manner.""We saw members of the opposition party not only entering the well of the House but also climbing onto the Speaker's table, tearing up papers, and throwing them towards the Speaker.Furthermore, sadly, some Honourable women members, behaving aggressively and carrying banners and placards, crossed over to the other side. They not only surrounded the Prime Minister's seat but also entered the Treasury benches where senior ministers sit,"" the letter said.“Therefore, we urge you to take the strictest possible action, under the rules, against those opposition MPs who have committed such heinous acts within the House premises and brought disrepute to our democratic institution,” it added.The BJP MPs’ letter comes a day after women MPs from the Congress wrote to Birla accusing him of acting under pressure from the ruling party to justify Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s absence from the House.The controversy stems from Birla’s statement in the Lok Sabha last week that he had received “concrete information” suggesting that several Congress members might approach the Prime Minister’s seat and carry out an “unexpected act.” The Speaker said he had, therefore, requested the Prime Minister not to attend the House to deliver his reply to the Motion of Thanks.In their letter, Congress women MPs strongly objected to the Speaker’s remarks and accused him of making baseless allegations.“Clearly pressured by the ruling party to defend the non-appearance of the Prime Minister, the Speaker issued a statement making grave allegations against the women MPs of the party,” the Congress MPs said.“We are being targeted simply because we have consistently fought against Prime Minister Narender Modi’s anti-people government and demanded accountability from him. His absence from the House was not due to any threat from us, it was an act of fear,” the letter added.The Congress MPs further rejected any suggestion that they had planned to disrupt proceedings.“He (PM) did not have the courage to face the Opposition. We are Members of Parliament from the Indian National Congress, a party that stands for love, peace, constitutional values, and human dignity. We do not believe in violence and intimidation. We are brave women elected representatives who will not be silenced by intimidation,” the letter, signed by MPs including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Jyothimani, R Sudha, Varsha Gaikwad and Jyotsna Mahant, stated.“We believe that transparency is the only way to restore the dignity of the Speaker’s office and the credibility of this House,” it said.The Congress MPs also alleged bias in disciplinary action, pointing out that eight INDIA bloc MPs were suspended at the “behest of the ruling party,” while a BJP MP was allowed to speak in a “vulgar and obscene manner” about former prime ministers.",Women mps from the bharatiya janata party (bjp) wrote to lok sabha speaker om birla.

BENGALURU: A 37-year-old Indian-origin tech professional from Karnataka was shot dead by unidentified assailants in a brazen daylight attack at the parking lot of a busy shopping mall in Toronto Saturday.The victim has been identified as Chandan Kumar Raja Nandakumar, a resident of Brampton in the Greater Toronto Area and a native of Thyamagondlu village near Nelamangala, Bengaluru Rural district.In Thyamagondlu, about 47 km from Bengaluru, Chandan's parents were struggling to come to terms with the loss of their only son. ""We spoke to him last Friday. He said he would take leave and come home this summer. We were planning for his marriage. We are completely shattered,"" his father Nandakumar said.No arrests have been made so far. Police in Toronto have launched a homicide investigation, suspecting a ""targeted"" attack. Some relatives suspect Chandan's efforts to form a Kannada association in Toronto could have played a role in the killing, though police have not indicated any motive so far.A computer science graduate from Sapthagiri College, Bengaluru, Chandan had moved to Canada about six years ago and was working with LTI Mindtree, a subsidiary of L&T.Earlier, he had worked with Cognizant in Bengaluru.The killing has sent shockwaves through the Indian diaspora in Canada. This is Toronto's third homicide this year and has triggered grief and outrage among Kannadigas, both in Canada and Karnataka.Family members said Chandan had repeatedly postponed his return to India. ""Had he listened to us and returned, he would have been with us now,"" Nandakumar lamented.Chandan was seated inside his SUV when the attackers opened fire near the entrance to Woodbine Shopping Centre, close to Rexdale Boulevard, around 3.30 pm (local time).According to an official release from Toronto Police Service (TPS), officers rushed to the spot after receiving reports of a shooting and found Chandan with multiple gunshot wounds. ""He was transported to a hospital with life-threatening injuries before he succumbed to the wounds,"" family members told TOI, quoting the TPS communication.Visuals from the scene showed Chandan's white car riddled with bullet holes, prompting investigators to treat the incident as a ""targeted"" attack. The suspects fled the scene in a vehicle.TPS Inspector Errol Watson said the incident raised public safety concerns. ""I can understand how a shooting like this, especially at a mall, can cause concern for the safety of the public,"" he told the media.Condoling the incident, Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara said: ""We are disturbed by the incident. We have lost a Kannadiga. Our police department has already sought the help of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) to bring back the body.""Chikkaballapura MP Dr K Sudhakar said he was coordinating with MEA authorities to facilitate the repatriation of Chandan's body.Friends said he was actively involved in Kannada cultural circles in Toronto, promoting Kannada films, music and community events.His uncle Murali Krishna said the family was unable to understand the motive behind the killing.

"Love, but no passage: What a killing changed for Meitei-Kuki couples",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/love-but-no-passage-what-a-killing-changed-for-meitei-kuki-couples/articleshow/128176965.cms,"Meitei-Kuki couples trapped in separation and fear as Manipur killing further deepens divide

For months, Meitei-Kuki couples across Manipur believed they had reached the safest point they were likely to get, fragile but predictable, after the violence that erupted in 2023. On Jan 21, that calm broke.Mayanglambam Rishikanta Singh, a 31-year-old Meitei man who had been working in Nepal, was abducted and shot dead in Churachandpur. Singh had quietly entered the Kuki-majority district on Dec 19 via Aizawl, Mizoram, to dodge the buffer-zone checkpoints between Imphal and Churachandpur, kin close to the family of his fiancee Chingnu Haokip said. He had come to see Chingnu after she sought permission from local authorities and representatives of Kuki National Organisation - an umbrella body of Kuki insurgent outfits under the Suspension of Operation agreement - and had lived with her for nearly a month before the killing.Officials later confirmed that Singh was abducted by armed militants from the Tuibong area and taken to a village under Henglep police station, where he was shot dead on camera.The chilling video circulated widely. It showed Singh kneeling with folded hands before armed men, prompting Churachandpur police to register a suo motu FIR.Chingnu Haokip was taken alongside him during the abduction but was beaten and thrown out of a moving vehicle, her family said.She was admitted to a trauma ward in Churachandpur, where doctors found her suffering from acute depression and shock. In hospital, she would answer with nods and could not hold on to what she ate, her loss too great to bear. A further blow followed: both sides of the ethnic divide ostracised her, with many accusing her of betrayal and circulating threats on social messaging groups.Chingnu has since been discharged from hospital, but remains in no condition to speak. Her family told TOI, “We do not want any more trouble”.The killing didn’t spill into fresh violence across Manipur, as many feared. In Imphal and Churachandpur, schools stayed open. Offices functioned. Roads reopened intermittently. But something shifted.In Kuki-majority Churachandpur, Icham Haokip, 34, is a Meitei woman who married into the Kuki community in 2010. Icham lost her husband, Lalneo, during the early phase of the violence. She stayed back in the hills with their five children, aged between eight and 15, and rebuilt a life that no longer depended on movement. “I don’t feel threatened here,” she said. “People know me. I have been accepted into the Kuki community. But the killing of Rishikanta tells you something — how vulnerable these relationships still are.”Across, in Meitei-majority Imphal valley, separation has been a defining condition since mid-2023 for Meitei-Kuki couples. Many were forced apart during evacuations, fleeing in opposite directions for safety. Over time, it became routine — marriages sustained through phone calls, reunions deferred without timelines. Late last year, there were faint signs the worst might be over. Some couples began, carefully, to plan. The murder on Jan 21 shook everything again.Thogjam Haokip, 70, a retired Kuki church pastor, has been married to his Meitei wife Kim, 50, for three decades. Their marriage predates the conflict. “We are not afraid. But we are not blind,” Kim said. We often think about how things would have turned out had we been living in another place. Would we be safe elsewhere? The thought gnaws at us.” The killings have deepened fear and stalled fragile hopes.","Meitei-kuki couples trapped in separation and fear as manipur killing further deepens divide.

‘Washing dirty linen in court’: HC tells kin of late industrialist Sunjay Kapur to go for mediation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/washing-dirty-linen-in-court-hc-tells-kapurs-to-go-for-mediation/articleshow/128179718.cms,"NEW DELHI: Taking a dim view of what it described as “washing dirty linen in court”, Delhi HC on Tuesday advised the mother, wife and family members of late industrialist Sunjay Kapur to go for mediation to resolve their differences and not let God’s “blessing of wealth turn into a curse”.After hearing multiple allegations levelled by the Kapur clan against each other, Justice Mini Pushkarna asked if there was “any chance of mediation”. “God has blessed you with good financial wealth. At the end of the day, all parties are in pain, they are grieving and all of you suffered. Lead a good life rather than fight,” Justice Pushkarna said.Sunjay, 53, died in London in June last year.The judge asked the senior counsel appearing for Sunjay’s mother, his wife and his sister to sit down together to solve their issues in a manner in which everyone’s interests were safeguarded. “All of you should try to respect relations… The way forward is resolution in a peaceful manner. Efforts need to be from both sides,” Justice Pushkarna observed orally.The HC was dealing with a lawsuit by Sunjay’s mother Rani Kapur for a purported family trust to be declared “null and void”. In her lawsuit against daughter-in-law Priya and others, 80-year-old Rani alleged that the trust, constituted in Oct 2017, was a product of “forged, fabricated and fraudulent” documents, and that she was wrongly divested of all her rights, assets and legacy.The high court also highlighted the need for Priya to realise it was Rani’s husband (Surinder Kapur) who “founded everything”, and the fruits of his labour should be shared by all.The HC issued notice to Priya and others on a plea by Rani to stay disbursal of dividends from a group company to her daughter-in-law and to preserve the estate. It also sought her stand on Priya’s claim that the suit be rejected.Rani’s suit says she is the sole beneficiary of the entire estate belonging to her late husband, Surinder, who was the promoter of various businesses, including Sona Group of Companies, and a “systematic fraud” was committed on her when the assets were transferred to the “RK Family Trust”.A separate plea by the two children of actor Karisma Kapoor, Sunjay’s former wife, challenging the authenticity of the purported will of their late father is also pending in the HC.","Delhi hc advises family of late industrialist sunjay kapur to go for mediation.

“Democracy Sliding Into ICU”: Opposition Targets BJP As BMC Polls Trigger Political Storm

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Tuesday warned of potential damage to its alliance with Maharashtra ally Shiv Sena (UBT), after the Uddhav Thackeray-led party, along with others, teamed up with the BJP, resulting in the election of the saffron party’s candidate as mayor of Chandrapur Municipal Corporation.The development was a major setback for the Congress, which was poised to win the mayor’s post but lost by just one vote.BJP corporator Sangeeta Khandekar was elected mayor, while Shiv Sena (UBT)’s Prashant Danav became deputy mayor.Maharashtra Congress chief Harshwardhan Sapkal alleged “horse-trading” and blamed Shiv Sena (UBT), Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM, and Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA).“In the Chandrapur mayoral election, the BJP secured 32 votes and Congress 31. The Sena (UBT) is an ally in the Maha Vikas Aghadi and the INDIA bloc. With its six corporators, the Sena (UBT) was expected to support the Congress. But the party chose to go with the BJP. This development will have consequences in the state,” Sapkal told reporters in Mumbai.“The BJP also gained the upper hand with the support of the AIMIM. If the VBA, with whom we had formed a genuine alliance in the civic body polls, had backed the Congress, our candidate would have won.There was horse-trading,” Sapkal added.Addressing the factional feud within the Chandrapur Congress, he said Congress corporators were “united,” and that he had personally resolved differences among party leaders in the city.“It is only because of the Shiv Sena (UBT), AIMIM, and VBA that the BJP could install its mayor,” the Maharashtra Congress chief asserted.Till Monday, alliances in the 66-member Chandrapur Municipal Corporation remained unclear following a fractured verdict in the January 15 polls.The Congress emerged as the largest party with 27 seats, while the BJP came a close second with 23, triggering a race between the two rivals to form a coalition and secure the mayor and deputy mayor posts.The Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT), a former BJP ally, won six seats, while three went to the Bharatiya Shetkari Kamgar Paksh (Janvikas Sena), two to the VBA, and one each to AIMIM, BSP, and Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena, a BJP ally. Two independents also secured wins. The poll results were declared on January 16.","The congress warned of potential damage to its alliance with maharashtra ally shiv sena (ubt) the uddhav thackeray-led party, along with others, teamed up with the bjp.
