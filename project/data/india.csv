Water ATMs and fishing for profit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/water-atms-and-fishing-for-profit/articleshow/124750796.cms,"Water sourced from coal mines is potentially valuable for much more than just domestic use. Beyond direct supply, several innovative projects are in development. In 2019, Western Coalfields Ltd (WCL) pioneered a plant producing ‘Coal Neer’ — a bottled drinking water brand — near Nagpur, providing purified water to villagers and creating an income source for women’s self-help groups (SHGs). Similarly, the Atal Community Innovation Centre (ACIC) at IIT-ISM in Dhanbad is working on deploying water ATMs that will treat mine water at multiple levels to provide clean drinking water to the public at a nominal cost.“We have piloted a model for pure drinking water (PARAM JAL) incubated at the ACIC IIT (ISM) Foundation. We’ve already set up a 24X7 coin/UPI water-vending ATM, where discharged mine water is being treated to provide drinking water to people at a nominal cost of Rs 10 for 10 litres. Along with Dhanbad Municipal Corporation (DMC), we are now working to set up these ATMs in five more places under the DMFT scheme,” said Akansha Sinha, CEO of ACIC.The use of mine voids is not limited to potable water. These are also emerging as a major source of livelihood. Studies by the College of Fisheries at Birsa Agricultural University in Ranchi have shown that abandoned opencast pits in Jharkhand can be transformed into fish farms.This is being achieved through targeted interventions — such as adding organic manure and fertilisers — to manage water quality and deployment of innovative aeration systems.Sashikar Mahto (38), secretary of Kuju Fisheries Cooperative Society in Ramgarh’s Kuju region, has emerged as a poster boy for mine-water fishing. Today, he leads a network of close to 70 local youths engaged in fisheries in CCL’s abandoned Ara mine numbers 8 and 13 in Kuju, with the local administration lending a helping hand.“While we began on our own a decade back, the local administration gave it a push through some funding two years ago. Today, a total of 22 (fisheries) cages have been set up that yield 50-60 tonnes of fish annually,” he said.Shambhu Prasad Yadav, deputy director of the state fisheries department, said, “Fish rearing is being done across 28 abandoned coal and stone pits across 12 districts of Jharkhand through 771 cages. Average production of fish from each cage is about three tonnes per annum.”","In 2019, western coalfields ltd (wcl) pioneered a plant producing ‘coal neer’ — a bottled drinking water brand.

Coal’s new ‘faucet’

TOI

Safe and sure

Water, water everywhere

Communities and officials grappling with the problem of tapped water supply in coal-belt states are courting an unlikely ally to bring about a change of fortune: abandoned coal mine pits. Hundreds of such pits have turned into reservoirs filled with water, emerging as a simple solution in areas that have only known perennial shortage. Though the idea is not new, the Centre is finally doubling down on it, identifying more than a hundred such pits to ease water woes across six states.The concerted push is the outcome of a recent study — the first of its kind — by the Ranchi-based Central Mine Planning & Design Institute (CMPDI). It said that 437 mine voids across both active and abandoned coal mines have an annual capacity of an estimated 2,760 lakh kilolitres of water — that’s enough to fill about 11,000 Olympic-sized pools. CMPDI followed up the findings by identifying 22 sites across six states for pilot projects. Eight of those sites are in Jharkhand, which is sort of the bellwether for this initiative.It was in Dec 2021 that the sound of running water greeted residents of Pondi panchayat in Jharkhand’s Ramgarh district.But it wasn’t a newly dug well, the common source of water for households and villages across large parts of the country. Sparing Pondi any spadework, quite literally, but endowing it with a ready lifeline was the abandoned ‘Ara mine’ number 8, a relic of Central Coalfields Ltd (CCL) lying dormant for years.The Pondi experiment was part of a handful of pilots for using water collected in mines — which is essentially rainwater and also underground seepage — that had been undertaken in coal-bearing areas in the last few years. It is their success that has now prompted the Union coal ministry to scale up efforts. Speaking toduring his visit to Ranchi recently, Union coal minister G Kishan Reddy said utilisation of mine water was one of the priorities of their govt and that they are putting in place a detailed action plan to make it happen.“Unfortunately, mine closures earlier used to rarely take place per prescribed norms. But now we have decided to focus on sustainable closure of mines to reduce environmental woes and create livelihood linkages. We are now targeting as many as 143 mines, where mining activities are over,” he said.“The plan is to use the water accumulated in these mines for various purposes, including employment generation. So far, some nine closures have taken place, but an action plan is being prepared on priority for closures of the remaining ones in next three to four years,” he added.If abandoned coal mines are being pursued to address water scarcity it’s because they’ve been found to be a safe, and scalable, bet. Experts say the water in these mines poses no hazards, while filtration and treatment plants have been put in place to improve its quality. “Unlike Western scenarios, where mine water is acidic, water from most Indian coal mines is suitable for domestic, industrial, and agricultural use with only moderate treatment,” said the CMPDI report. The treated water is even considered viable for bottled-water production. The experience on the ground has certainly been encouraging.The quiet initiation of the project during the pandemic in Pondi has now grown to become a lifeline for 1,600 households across eight villages. People who had to walk miles in search of water can now just turn on their tap. Rural homemakers like Savita Devi (40) of Bongahara village hail the easy access to water at their doorstep. “Now, water from the mine directly reaches my house. I also use it for cooking. This leaves me with time for other work,” she said. Popal Devi (52), the Pondi panchayat mukhiya, said the project would perhaps reverse the trend of migration from the area due to severe water scarcity.Making the water potable involves a multi-step treatment process. A 1.4 million litres per day (MLD) capacity water treatment plant was set up in the village into which the water from the closed mine is lifted daily. It undergoes filtration using limestone, sandpit, and chlorine before being stored in a well and moved to two overhead tanks for daily supply. To ensure the system’s sustainability, the panchayat has appointed two women, known as ‘jal sahiyas’, to inspect the pipelines and collect a monthly water payment of Rs 62 per household.Tarun Paliwal, CMPDI’s public relations officer, said the study benchmarked mine water quality against Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) classifications and BIS:10500 standards. “In a review meeting held on Aug 8 this year, the coal secretary lauded CMPDI and directed coal companies to develop action plans for treating and reusing mine water to enhance local community well-being and water security,” he said.Pondi is not an isolated story. About 100km away in Piparwar, CCL rolled out a similar pilot. “In Bachra and adjoining villages alone, water from the closed mine pit is being supplied to around 3,000 households, besides the CCL’s Piparwar officers’ colony,” said an official of the environment wing of the Piparwar project area.“Across the Piparwar area, we have set up around eight mini water filtration plants from where people can access water. For example, the filtration plant at CCL hospital in Piparwar generates 2,000 MGD water/hour for in-house use,” the official added.Abhay Singh, chief scientist at the Dhanbad-based Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research (CIMFR), said that except for NorthEastern India, their studies, too, have revealed that water from mine pits can easily be put to good use.“In Assam and Meghalaya, water in the mines has heavy metals and has 7-8% acidity vis-a-vis 1-2% in the rest of the country. Scaling up mine water usage in the country can provide answers to challenges of water scarcity,” he said, adding that although a few independent projects are underway across coal-bearing regions in India, there is a need for a consolidated push for a mine-water utilisation mission.According to a statement from Coal India Ltd (CIL), mine water usage for community benefit is not a new concept. In the fiscal year 202425, CIL’s mine discharge was approximately 5,717 lakh kilolitres, with over 45% (around 2,572 LKL) shared for community use. Minister Reddy has told Rajya Sabha that CIL, NLC India Ltd, and Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) are all actively utilising treated mine water. CIL alone is supplying water to 878 villages, benefiting about 11.7 lakh people. NLCIL in Tamil Nadu supplies treated mine water for both power generation and drinking, benefiting 9.6 lakh locals.","Hundreds of abandoned mines have become reservoirs holding water that experts say is safe to use.

Poll Do you believe Nitish Kumar's return to NDA is a positive move for Bihar? Yes, it's a great decision No, it's not beneficial

NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), saying he had joined the party “because of circumstances.” Reaffirming his commitment to the NDA , he said he is “back in NDA for good.” He also criticised the RJD’s rule before his 20-year tenure as chief minister, saying, “pehle bahut bura haal tha,” and highlighted the shortcomings of the Lalu-Rabri governments, taking aim at their administration.Addressing his first election rally in Minapur, Muzaffarpur, Kumar took a dig at his rival Lalu Prasad and said, “Because of circumstances, I had to tie up with those people, but it did not take me long to realise that they were good for nothing. Now I am back (in NDA) for good.”Kumar recalled that his earlier alliances with the RJD in 2015 and 2022 both lasted less than two years. On both occasions, Lalu’s son Tejashwi Yadav, now leader of the opposition in Vidhan Sabha, served as his deputy chief minister.He highlighted his government’s focus on improving infrastructure, education, and healthcare in Bihar, and praised the Narendra Modi government at the Centre for its support.Talking about law and order, Kumar said, “An atmosphere of terror had prevailed in Bihar because of poor law and order and alleged patronage to criminals by the powers that be, until I took over. But now, it is for all to see how much things have changed.”He added that communal harmony has also improved. “Even disputes between Hindus and Muslims have come down because we were sensitive to needs like fencing of religious places of both faiths,” he said.Taking a swipe at Lalu Prasad, Kumar accused him of ignoring women’s welfare during his tenure. “Did the ones in power do anything for women? They could not have cared less. Only when, after seven years of chief ministership, a situation came where stepping down could not have been avoided, the wife was installed,” he said, referring to Rabri Devi’s appointment as chief minister in 1997.Kumar contrasted this with his own government’s focus on women’s empowerment, citing the success of self-help groups and the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, under which Rs 10,000 each has been transferred to over one crore women beneficiaries.Seeking a record fifth consecutive term, Nitish Kumar said he was disillusioned with the RJD after two short-lived alliances and has now decided to stay with the NDA for good.","Bihar chief minister nitish kumar reflected on his past alliances with the rashtriya janata dal.

NEW DELHI: President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday offered prayers at the Lord Ayyappa temple in Sabarimala, becoming the first woman head of state to do so. She is also the second Indian president to visit the temple, after V V Giri.Clad in a black Saree, Murmu arrived at Pamba around 11 am in a special convoy. According to temple's official website, ""Black is the recommended colour for clothes during the ‘Vruthum’ period as the colour denotes detachment from material things.""Following tradition, she washed her feet in the Pampa river and prayed at nearby temples, including the Lord Ganapathy shrine. Vishnu Namboothiri, the chief priest of the Ganapathy temple, filled her sacred bundle, or, at the Kettunira Mandapam. The president was accompanied by her ADC Saurabh S Nair, PSO Vinay Mathur, and son-in-law Ganesh Hembram, who also prepared their sacred bundles.They broke coconuts near the temple and then took four-wheel-drive vehicles to the Sannidhanam along the 4.5-km Swami Ayyappan Road and the traditional trekking route. At Sannidhanam, President Murmu climbed the 18 holy steps to the sanctum, where she was received by state Devaswom minister V N Vasavan and Travancore Devaswom board (TDB) president P S Prasanth. The temple, Kandararu Mahesh Mohanaru, welcomed her with aMurmu offeredof Lord Ayyappa with the sacred bundle on her head and placed it on the temple steps for. She later prayed at nearby shrines of Vavaraswamy and Malikappuram. Before leaving, TDB officials presented her with an idol of Lord Ayyappa.President Murmu’s visit holds comes years after the Sabarimala temple became the centre of intense debate and protests over women’s entry. In 2018, the Supreme Court had ruled that women of all ages could enter the shrine, overturning the traditional ban on those between 10 and 50 years of age, as Lord Ayyappa is worshipped as a(perennial celibate). The verdict had triggered widespread opposition from devotees and sparked a political and social divide in Kerala.Murmu’s pilgrimage conducted strictly within temple customs and age-old rituals is being seen as a moment of quiet symbolism. BJP leader Bandi Sanjay Kumar praised her visit on X, writing, “She is 67. She broke no rules, hurt no faith, she only honoured it. In doing so, she became the first president ever to carry theand bow before Lord Ayyappa. Her visit reminds us that devotion doesn’t shout; it simply stands tall. A moment that reflects the deep faith uniting millions of Ayyappa devotees across India. Those 18 steps have seen debate and defiance, yet devotion always finds its dignity.”",President droupadi murmu offered prayers at the lord ayyappa temple in sabarimala.

Doctor: No energy or sports drink can replace true ORS



After eight years of a relentless campaign against the term ‘ORS’ (oral rehydration solution) being used for many packaged beverages, often high in sugar, Hyderabad-based paediatrician Dr Sivaranjani Santosh has finally seen a breakthrough. Food Safety and Standards Authority of India issued an advisory last week banning food and beverage companies from using the term in product names, labels or trademarks, even as a prefix or suffix.Many doctors TOI spoke to said cases of parents mistaking flavoured “hydration” or “electrolyte” drinks for ORS are becoming increasingly common.“These drinks contain 10 times more sugar than the amount recommended by World Health Organization and are sold in pharmacies as ORS,” Santosh told TOI. “Instead of rehydrating, it worsens diarrhoea, especially in children, who are far more vulnerable... This is extremely dangerous...” While WHO recommends 13.5gm of sugar per litre in ORS, fake products contain 110g-120g.In India, diarrhoea accounts for around 13% of all deaths in children under five years, making it a leading cause of childhood mortality in the country. Santosh took up the fight after coming across many cases where children ended up in hospital with severe dehydration after having these drinks.“We received a four-year-old child in the emergency — listless, weak, and severely dehydrated.The parents said they had been giving her ‘ORS water’ for two days,” recalled Dr Dhiren Gupta, co-director, paediatric intensive care unit, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi. “But when we checked, it turned out they had been using a sweetened energy drink sold online as an ‘ORS substitute’. The child’s condition worsened instead of improving.”Gupta added that blood tests in such cases often show dangerously low sodium and high sugar levels. “Any solution meant to correct dehydration must have the right balance of salt and sugar,” he said. “We had another one-year-old patient who suffered brain bleeding and seizures after being given a concentrated salt solution. The sodium levels were extremely high. Both extremes — too little or too much salt — can be life-threatening. ”Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant, internal medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, said, “We frequently admit children with moderate to severe dehydration because caregivers used sweetened or flavoured drinks thinking they were ORS. Correct WHO-ORS, if given early, could have prevented it.” “Glucose helps the body absorb sodium, which retains water. During diarrhoea, both are lost, leading to kidney failure or brain swelling. A properly mixed ORS restores this safely, but a diluted or sugary version can worsen dehydration,” explained Dr Dinesh Yadav, paediatric cardiologist at Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital.Doctors stressed that awareness, not fear, is key. “ORS saves lives — but only when made and used correctly,” Yadav said. “Parents must use WHO-approved sachets, mix them exactly as directed, and avoid all flavoured or commercial ‘hydration’ drinks. No energy or sports drink can replace true ORS.” “When parents walk into a pharmacy looking for ORS, they trust the product to save their child’s life. Around eight years ago, many children’s conditions worsened due to this ORS, though fortunately, no deaths were directly linked then. It was infuriating to see profits being prioritised above children’s health. Giving sugar-laden formulas like these could actually kill,” Santosh said.She claimed that the companies initially tried to silence her by offering her speaking roles at their events. “Later, they did not contact me directly, but I did face a significant backlash and threats on social media from anonymous accounts, which made the fight harder.” Though the journey was long and exhausting, Santosh is relieved after the FSSAI order. She spent years raising awareness online, sending complaints to drug and health authorities like CDSCO, FSSAI, and the central health ministry. “I gathered videos, patient testimonies, and evidence from doctors. I went through everything — dejection, anger, hope, exhaustion. Though it should not have taken this long, after seeing the order I was overwhelmed. I told people long back that this would become big but nobody listened.”Meanwhile, after the FSSAI ban, manufacturers moved the Delhi high court, arguing that the order came without prior notice or consultation and affects their existing stock worth about Rs 180 crore. The court granted temporary relief, allowing companies to sell their current stock, but stopped the production of new sugary drinks labelled as ORS.","The food safety and standards authority of india issued an advisory last week banning food and beverage companies from using the term in product names, labels or trademarks.

Congress vs BJP:Karnataka Minister Priyank Kharge Sparks Debate on RSS Event in Public Institutionss

NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah ’s son, MLC Yathindra Siddaramaiah, on Wednesday said that his father is at the fag end of his political career and should guide his colleague Satish Jarkiholi to lead Congress party. The comments come amid ongoing speculation about a possible leadership change in the state.“My father, (Siddaramaiah), is in the final stages of his political career. Satish Jarkiholi must take the Congress forward,” Yathindra Siddaramaiah said at an event.He made the remarks during the unveiling of the idol of Kanakadasa in Kappalaguddi village of Raibag taluk in Belagavi district.Speculations are rife about a change of guard in the state when the Congress government reaches the halfway mark of its five-year term in November, referred to by some as the ""November revolution"".Yathindra’s comments have triggered discussions in political circles. Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah has maintained that he will serve his full term and lead the party in the next assembly elections. Meanwhile, supporters of deputy chief minister and state Congress president DK Shivakumar continue to push for him to be given an opportunity to head the government, citing his role in strengthening the party.However, Yathindra later clarified that his statement was not about leadership change in the state.""My statement was not about changing the Chief Minister. Because Siddaramaiah sir said that after 2028, he will not contest elections, I only said that after him, someone who believes strongly in Congress ideology, which is social justice, secular ideology, should be able to lead the Congress party. That's all I have said,"" Yathindra Siddaramaiah said while talking to news agency ANI.There has been speculation within state's political circles, especially in the ruling Congress, for some time now about a potential change in CM later this year, linked to a power-sharing agreement between incumbent Siddaramaiah and Deputy CM D K Shivakumar.Meanwhile, Yathindra asserted last week that his father will finish his five-year term as the Karnataka CM in the best interest of the state. Yathindra clarified that there is no question of a leadership change. ""CM Siddaramaiah will remain in office for five years. He enjoys full support from MLAs.

The latest livestock census paints a grim picture — the state now has just 3,052 donkeys, a sharp fall from 49,289 in 1997, marking a 94% decline in less than three decades.Nine of the 55 districts have reported zero donkeys, signalling near-total disappearance of the animal that once powered rural India’s transport and trade.While there are no specific studies behind disappearance of donkeys yet, Gurgaon-based animal rights activist Naresh Kadyan had urged the Centre to declare donkeys an endangered species, warning that China’s demand for donkey hide is pushing the decline. He blames China’s “ejiao” industry — where hides are boiled to extract gelatin used in traditional tonics, aphrodisiacs, and anti-ageing creams — for pushing the species toward extinction.Official figures show Narmadapuram has the highest number of donkeys (332), followed by Chhatarpur (232), Rewa (226), and Morena (228), while Vidisha, once home to over 6,400 donkeys, now has just 171, and Bhopal only 56.

NEW DELHI: A staggered pan-India special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls will get underway within four-five days, with each phase likely to be spread over three months, on the lines of the one completed in Bihar . The last intensive revision of the roll was undertaken over two decades ago.Sources indicated that the nationwide SIR may be held in phases, with certain states/UTs such as J&K and Ladakh, which will soon be snow-bound, and ones where nearly 75%-80% of the electorate has been mapped by matching current electors with entries in the 2003/2004 rolls published after the last intensive revision, being left out of the initial phase.“They can be taken up later as barely 20%-25% of electors in these states will need to submit documents to prove their eligibility as per Article 326 of the Constitution. The immediate priority will be the five states due for assembly polls next year,” said an EC official.Going by the three-month SIR schedule followed in Bihar, the final roll — to be published after claims and objections to the draft roll are settled — for states/UTs likely to be covered in the initial phase may be out by Jan-end or beginning of Feb.The preparation for the upcoming countrywide SIR — the intent for which was announced by EC in its June 24 notification for the SIR in Bihar — was the key topic of discussion at the two-day conference of chief electoral officers being held by EC on Wednesday and Thursday.The conference’s opening day, presided over by chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, saw EC assess the preparedness of all state/UT CEO offices for the nationwide SIR. The meeting is a follow-up of the Sept 10 CEO’s conference, when all CEOs had briefed EC on the last SIR undertaken and the roll published thereafter.Sources said CEOs are upbeat about the upcoming nationwide SIR, with some states already having mapped up to 75% of their electorate based on the roll from the last intensive revision.In Bihar, nearly 80% of the electorate had matched with the 2003 roll. Three months, thus, were more than enough for the exercise, where only the remaining 20% — possibly comprising parents who never cared to enrol as electors or non-citizens — were required to submit documents.The fact that limited claims and objections were made despite a 30-day window and no appeals were filed with district magistrate (the sole appeal made was found incorrect) in the 15-day timeframe after publication of the final roll, stands testimony to the precision with which SIR was carried out,” said an EC official.EC sources, who indicated that the pan-India SIR timeline will be finalised in a day or two followed by its announcement in four to five days, said the list of documents to be accepted as proof of identity, age and citizenship would more or less remain the same as Bihar, though documents unique to a given state/UT may be considered.“In any case, the list of 11 documents is not exhaustive but only indicative,” said an official.Aadhaar card will only be accepted as a proof of identity. An alternative document, as per the list specified by the poll panel, will be needed to prove one’s citizenship and residence, the official added.","Timeline for pan-india sir to be finalised in 2-3 days, say ec sources.

Police warn against 'misinformation'

West Bengal Police post

NEW DELHI: The alleged desecration of a Goddess Kali idol triggered outrage in West Bengal's South 24 Parganas district on Wednesday, with the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accusing the Trinamool Congress (TMC)-led state government of ""shielding"" the culprits.The incident occurred at a village under the Suryanagar gram panchayat area in the Kakdwip assembly constituency, where locals reportedly found the damaged idol inside a temple, news agency PTI reported.The idol was later taken awayin a prison van, further escalating tensions and fuelling political slugfest over the incident. BJP leaders shared videos of the idol being removed and accused chief minister Mamata Banerjee of “insulting” Hindu sentiments — a charge the party has repeatedly levelled against the Trinamool supremo.Rejecting the allegation, a TMC leader accused the BJP of trying to ""vitiate the atmosphere.""""The BJP is trying to communalise the incident and vitiate the atmosphere. Let police complete the probe. We condemn any attempt to disturb the harmony in this area,"" the leader, a local party functionary, stated.Meanwhile, the West Bengal Police issued a statement, saying that ""misinformation"" was being spread about the incident.“Efforts are being made from certain quarters to spread misinformation about an incident in Kakdwip. Facts are: an idol of Goddess Kali in a village temple under Suryanagar GP was found to be damaged this morning. Efforts are on to identify the person/persons behind the mischief. Stern action will be taken against those responsible for the incident,"" it posted on X.The police added that locals had blocked the national highway in protest and refused to go ahead with the immersion.“Police persuaded the agitators for hours to withdraw the blockade, which was causing serious public inconvenience, with ambulances carrying patients also being stuck. When the agitators did not relent and started pelting stones at the police, minimum force was resorted to by the police to disperse the mob. The immersion of the idol was facilitated thereafter,” it said.The incident comes ahead of next year’s West Bengal assembly elections, where Mamata Banerjee will seek a fourth consecutive term as chief minister.","The alleged desecration of a goddess kali idol triggered outrage in west bengal's south 24 parganas district.

All confusion over CM face will end today, says Gehlot



PATNA: RJD scion Tejashwi Yadav ’s long wait to be officially declared INDIA bloc’s CM face in Bihar looked set to end after Congress ’s designated troubleshooter, Ashok Gehlot, and the party’s state in-charge Krishna Allavaru met him and his father Lalu Prasad in Patna Wednesday to break a stalemate that has dragged into the business end of elections.Congress kept mum on the outcome of the meeting, but ally CPI(ML)’s general secretary, Dipankar Bhattacharya, suggested patience was running out within the alliance over the delay in declaring what he said was a no-brainer.“Tejashwi’s name as the opposition’s CM candidate could be officially announced at INDIA bloc’s joint press conference on Thursday. Entire Bihar knows Tejashwi will be the CM if INDIA bloc gets majority,” Bhattacharya said.“Our meeting with Lalu was highly positive. INDIA bloc is united and contesting the elections as a strong force. The full situation will be clarified at the presser,” Gehlot said, emerging from the meeting, along with Tejashwi.Ashok Gehlot, however, declined to go beyond proclaiming that “all confusion” would end at Thursday’s press conference.Congress has so far been cagey about naming Tejashwi as INDIA bloc’s unanimous pick, refusing to reciprocate the latter’s move of publicly acknowledging Lok Sabha LoP Rahul Gandhi as the alliance’s prime ministerial face for the next general elections.“Tejashwi becoming CM is as straight a choice as Nitish Kumar not becoming the CM again,” Bhattacharya said.On INDIA bloc allies contesting against each other in some places because of the seat-sharing dispute, Gehlot rejected the idea that “friendly fights” within INDIA bloc were an issue. “Such things are normal. Bihar wants a change, and people understand that our victory is in interest of the country,” he said.Allavaru, blamed for the mess, said Congress was “serious” about the assembly polls.Earlier in the day, Tejashwi downplayed talk of alliance being fragmented. “There is no controversy or confusion in INDIA bloc...Will talk tomorrow. You will get an answer to every question,” he said.The INDIA bloc brass was last seen together at the launch of ‘Ati Pichhda EBC Sankalp Patra’ in Patna on Sept 24. On that occasion, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul, Tejashwi and Vikassheel Insaan Party chief Mukesh Sahani were present.Prior to that, the group travelled together during Rahul’s fortnight-long Voter Adhikar Yatra that passed through 25-odd districts.","Tejashwi slams double-engine govt on corruption,assures no seat-sharing disputes in mahagathbandhan.

Prabakaran contended that the music company had even failed to provide the day-to-day revenue generated by exploiting his works, as directed by the court.Opposing the submissions, senior advocate Vijay Narayan submitted the company had moved a transfer application before the Supreme Court, which had issued notice on the application.Recording the submission, Justice N Senthilkumar observed that since the apex court had admitted the transfer application and ordered notice on the same, it was inappropriate for him to hear the case. To this, Prabakaran submitted that the SC has not issued any interim orders staying the proceedings before the HC.Therefore, there was no impediment for HC to hear the case.On HC’s interim order directing Sony to file a report on the day-to-day revenue earned by exploiting the compositions of the petitioner, Narayan submitted that the report was ready, and they were inclined to file it in a sealed cover to maintain the confidentiality of the revenue details.Opposing this, Prabakaran contended that even SC had not appreciated filing reports in sealed covers in many instances. Considering the objection, the judge decided not to take on record the report filed by Sony and chose to wait for the outcome of the application moved before SC.Insisting that the revenue report must be made available to the petitioner, Prabakaran submitted that the movie ‘Dude’, released on Oct 17, had earned Rs 75 crore so far.Pointing out that the petitioner must file a separate application for his grievances against the movie, the high court adjourned the hearing to Nov 27.","Music composer ilaiyaraaja is fighting a copyright battle against a batch of music labels. ‘dude’, starring director-turned-actor pradeep ranganathan, used two of his songs in the film without his authorisation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124750134,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-497425,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Union of India,” Justice Subhash Vidyarthi of Allahabad high court said.The judgment of Delhi HC in question stated that “there is no impediment in taking the third FIR on record which related to the same project forming the basis for registration of the first two FIRs, resulting in initiation of the impugned ECIR…” The ECIR is ED’s enforcement case information report, equivalent to a police FIR, for initiating an investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The court, in its Oct 17 judgment, also held that a probe by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) does not in any way restrict the ED from carrying out its own investigations under PMLA, dismissing Sahara’s plea that once an investigation has been entrusted to SFIO under the Companies Act, investigation by any other agency becomes barred.“This submission also cannot be accepted because even after extension of the scope of investigation by SFIO, it does not include investigation against any of the petitioners, namely, Humara India Credit Cooperative Society Ltd, Sahara Credit Cooperative Society Ltd, Stars Multipurpose Cooperative Society Ltd and Saharayan Universal Multipurpose Society Ltd. Therefore, there is no illegality in continuation of proceedings under PMLA against the petitioners,” the judge said.The court also rejected the contention of Sahara entities that ED cannot investigate the matter since the case falls under the ambit of the Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Act (BUDS), which overrides IPC – and as BUDS offences are not scheduled offences under PMLA.“Merely because an act makes out commission of an offence under the BUDS Act, it cannot be said that although the act is punishable as an offence under IPC also, the offender cannot be prosecuted for commission of the offence punishable under IPC. Therefore, I find no force in the second submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner,” Justice Subhash Vidyarthi observed.","Even if one fir is closed, the existence of other firs with the same or similar allegations will be valid ground for continuation of ed's investigation under pmla, allahabad high court has ruled. In the sahara case, the hc took cognisance of ed’s submission that 502 firs were filed against sahara group entities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124749726,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-744366,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
