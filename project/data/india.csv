NEW DELHI: India carried out a nationwide civil defence exercise , "" Operation Abhyaas ,"" on Wednesday, featuring drills simulating air raids, fire emergencies, rescue operations, and other emergency scenarios across multiple states and Union Territories.The Ministry of Home Affairs had earlier announced these security exercises on Monday, which were implemented across numerous states and UTs, including Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Assam, Mizoram, Tripura, Nagaland, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur.This exercise occurred shortly after the Indian military initiated Operation Sindoor against terror facilities in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). The military action was conducted in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that resulted in 26 casualties.The emergency preparedness exercise assessed various aspects including civilian response training, blackout procedures , protection of crucial facilities, civil defence service effectiveness, and evacuation protocol implementation.Loud sirens, people rushing to safety, and mock injured victims being carried on stretchers were among the scenes during security drills held at 55 locations across Delhi.Delhi witnessed substantial security arrangements with PCR vehicles, fire engines positioned strategically, alongside deployment of security personnel and civil defence volunteers.Emergency response teams utilised Delhi Fire Services cranes for evacuating individuals ""trapped"" in tall buildings. Alert sirens rang at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport, prompting fire brigade units to respond alongside medical teams and ambulances.Educational institutions across Delhi participated in safety procedures, including systematic evacuations, desk sheltering, and powering down electrical equipment upon hearing warning sirens.Later that evening, various areas of the capital, including Lutyens' Delhi, experienced an unprecedented 15-minute power cut, which resulted in darkness across significant areas, encompassing Parliament, India Gate, diplomatic missions and administrative centres, as part of the nationwide civil defence exercise.The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) implemented the blackout from 8 pm to 8.15 pm to replicate emergency wartime conditions.Punjab conducted emergency simulations across multiple cities including Ferozepur, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Bathinda, Gurdaspur, Hoshiarpur, Patiala, Pathankot, Barnala and Mohali, focusing on fire emergencies and rescue operations.Blackout at Sri Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) in Amritsar, as part of the mock drill.In Mumbai, strategic locations, particularly railway stations, were involved in the exercise.

Engineers and technicians have been told to be ""ready"" to leave at short notices for repair work.""Our staff critical for maintenance have been told to be prepared for any requirement and some have been asked to volunteer in case there's a requirement for travel. We've already started an additional shift between 7pm and 11pm; and if needed, we are prepared to work round the clock,"" an HAL source said.HAL is the fourth line of service for commissioned fighter planes, including repair of engines, avionics, and other major control systems. The first two lines of service are at the squadron level. The third line of service, requiring a slightly higher degree of repair work, is available at various base repair depots (BRDs). A retired IAF officer said that during peacetime, aircraft needing the fourth or fifth line of service are sent to HAL as there's time to get them back. But in emergency situations, IAF does not have such luxury. And therefore, it is general practice to have back-up staff on their toes.HAL handles the Su-30 and the MiG fleets in Nasik, while all European platforms of fixed wing fighters (Mirage & Jaguar) are handled in Bengaluru. All the choppers are repaired at Helicopter complex in Bengaluru. ""But during emergencies, aircraft cannot be brought here, so we must be ready to go,"" an HAL official in Bengaluru said.During the Kargil conflict in 1999, a retired HAL employee had told TOI earlier, technicians had ""continuously worked for over two months"".

""I relate to the choice of the word 'sindoor' for the operation.

We were at Mumukshu Bhavan , a 100-year-old institution near the Assi Ghat of Varanasi, where elderly Hindus live out their last years. One section is for monks like Jairam Ashram, who belong to the Dasanami sect of Hindu monks. The “Ashram” in his name, which I had assumed meant institutional affiliation, is actually one of 10 titles for each sub-sect.Avdhesh Tiwari, the caretaker of Mumukshu Bhavan, was accompanying me when I met him. He explained later: “When Dandi Swamis renounce the pleasures of life, they say they have conducted their own funeral and been born again. So, when you asked about his life before Varanasi, he was upset. What he meant was that he can’t go back to the life he left and that pains him. Because he has ‘died’. If he meets those who were his family in his ‘past life’, they will only see a ghost.”Perhaps. But Jairam Ashram did tell me he came to Mumukshu Bhavan in 2020 and stays in touch with his mother. Before that, he added, he was a farmer who also worked as a labourer — work was hard to come by — at Chhatarpur in Madhya Pradesh.Another monk, who didn’t tell me his name, used to be a teacher. When I asked why he and so many others were here to ensure their last breath was in Varanasi, he said: “There is no alternative to death. It is the biggest truth of nature. If it weren’t inevitable, people would seek eternal life. But they can’t. So, they seek moksh and want their death to be auspicious. Becausetakes you from death towards life, just in a different manner.”In this part of the bhavan, the monks wake up early, perform puja, leave to collect alms and then go back to puja after returning. “What else will monks do?” asked Dandiswami Indradeva Ashram, amused when I asked what the daily routine was.When a monk dies, the Bhavan takes responsibility for cremation. The body is made to sit in this red chair and taken around before it heads to the burning ghats.When Avdhesh was showing me the red chair, a man in white was cycling past us. Avdhesh stopped him. “Tell her something about yourself,” he nudged the man. The man, Ramprasad Dwivedi, started with a Sanskrit shloka. He said it meant all sins are destroyed in Kashi The other half of Mumukshu Bhavan is for what they call “Kashivasis”, those who wish to be residents of Kashi. “Any Hindu who is 60 or older and has a family is allowed to live here for the rest of their lives. Basically, people in retirement. People make their own food, buy their own things. We are here for support,” said Manish Pandey. Only Hindus? “Yes,” he said. “It is a religious institution. No Muslims or foreigners.”For residents, no money is charged. But the waiting lists can be long. “Sometimes, people whose applications are in the queue die before those who live here,” said Avdhesh. Then, he took me to see a couple who had given up their house in UP’s Deoria to live here. The man, a retired music lecturer at Mani Nath Inter College, had stepped out. His wife (she wasn’t comfortable sharing her name) was around. Their room had an AC and a cooler. Residents can install any appliance they want.“We have been here for six years now. My husband retired in 2009,” she said. “We used to keep coming to Varanasi and decided this is where we want to die. It is auspicious to die here. My brother-in-law lives at our house now with his kids. We don’t have children.” They felt happy about the simplicity of life here, she added.When we got out of the room, Avdhesh said, “Someone named Sita used to live in that room. She died nine years ago. She was all alone. A school principal.” If someone dies without anyone who can cremate them, the Bhavan organises the funeral.Waiting most ardently for death, maybe out of compulsion, was another elderly woman. A bed and a cooler. That was all she had. Her husband worked with electricals as long as he could. Because he didn’t have a steady job, there was no retirement plan. When they got old, they had nowhere to go.“We moved into Mumukshu Bhavan 22 years ago. My husband died 12 years ago,” she said. “I have a daughter. My grandchildren send some money. I have lived too long.”My final stop was Manikarnika Ghat , one of the two burning ghats in Varanasi (the other is Harishchandra). Like everything in the city, it is enmeshed in a series of mythic stories.That Shiva’s earrings, manikarnika, fell into a pit Vishnu was digging with his chakra. Or that Shiva was mad with rage when Sati killed herself after a king insulted him — to calm him down, Vishnu cut Sati’s body into 51 pieces and the earrings landed here. Or that Parvati concealed her earrings here to stop Shiva from going away from here. “Every soul that is here after death is asked by Shiva, ‘Have you seen the earrings?’” Panna Thakur, the funerary barber at the ghat, told me. “He’s still looking.”What I had seen of Manikarnika before this were really old photos, archival ones, from the British Library. “Burning the body is a way of offering it to Agni, the god of fire. The ashes are later scattered onto the river,” says the caption to this 1865 photograph.And this is a 1903 photo of those handling cremation at the Manikarnika Ghat.I was not prepared for the actual experience. Yes, it is a historical cremation ghat and what else would someone expect to see? A temple-like structure with centuries of soot, a piece of yellow fabric that belonged to someone once and one forgotten slipper. Just the sound of wood and bodies burning slowly. The silence stupefied me. Barring one elderly man, who was there to cremate his young son, no one shed a tear.“Kal(the wish of Kal, the god of time) doesn’t operate here, only Bhairon(the desire of Bhairon, a form of Shiva associated with annihilation),” said Panna. When someone’s time is up on earth, he went on, the god of time can’t take them away without permission from Bhairon. “So, no one is afraid of death.”Maybe. But it still means conversations which place a value on a life that has just ended. Huge scales to weigh the cremation wood line the ghats. Do you want the good timber for the one you loved? Will you buy the best flowers or settle for something within your budget? It is, however, work that must be done. Can’t grudge anyone that.Presiding over everything, for instance, are the Dom — a community of Dalits historically associated with handling corpses — dictating cremation costs and perfunctorily dismissing those who don’t comply. After centuries of caste-based atrocities that meant to isolate them, they call the shots here.On my way out, I saw that a signboard from the time Covid-19 had first struck was still hanging, announcing the government-mandated costs of cremation — Rs 7,000 for those with Covid-19 and Rs 5,000 for those without. “Those are for people to see, not to follow,” said a person at a teastall next to it. “Who will haggle about death?”After coming back to Delhi, I would keep wondering what happened to Chaturbhuj Jha. On June 19, I called Kalikant Dubey at Mukti Bhavan to ask. “He obtainedon June 8. He was cremated at Manikarnika.”","Mumukshu bhavan is a 100-year-old institution near the assi ghat of varanasi, where elderly hindus live out their last years. One section is for monks like jairam ashram, who belong to the dasanami sect of hindu monks. When a monk dies, the bhavan takes responsibility for cremation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-92378357,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1572183,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

For some, it’s a wait for ‘second death’

What saddens me the most about death is thinking about unfulfilled wishes. When I saw Chaturbhuj Jha, a 95-year-old retired teacher from Bihar, lying in a sparse room waiting to die, I wondered if he had any. But this, his grandsons told me, was indeed his last remaining wish — to die in Varanasi.“He used to say he would draw his last breath in Kashi ,” Brajesh Jha, his grandson, told me. “The doctor had given him a week to live after a heart stroke. We rushed him here from Delhi in a car so he could die in Kashi.”A lot has been written about Hindus who come to Varanasi to live out their last days. But I did wonder what it means to face the moment one realises that they are about to die. Do they think about what their life amounted to? Do they wish they had done more, or differently? And do they actually come to terms with the end of life?In Varanasi, one thing did strike me — the many ways Hindus speak of death.(their body has gone calm),(they’ve left their body) or(they’ve found release). Because it is here, they have faith, that the finality of death ceases to matter.Chaturbhuj Jha was one such believer. And he was biding his time at Mukti Bhavan.About 2km from Dashashwamedh Ghat, concealed in a lane behind a bustling thoroughfare, is the Kashi Labh Mukti Bhavan. It was set up in 1958 by industrialist Jaydayal Dalmia.The rules are straightforward — a person of any faith who thinks they are close to death can live out their last few days here. At least two members of the family must accompany them. They pay a token Rs 20 a day as “electricity charges”. But if they can’t afford it, they are not asked to.They can stay on for 15 days. “If they don’t get(die) in 15 days, we ask them politely if they can make other arrangements,” said Kalikant Dubey, priest at the Bhavan, who also manages the day-to-day operations.Chaturbhuj Jha had been around for 45 days at the time. “If someone is in a critical state, we allow them to wait,” Dubey said. It’s a subjective call, really. “The longest anyone has waited here was 108 days. It was a woman from Bihar, whose son said he would not leave until his mother got.”. The idea that people are reborn into a cycle of life and death, and release from that cycle is the ultimate reward of a life well led.“Our scriptures say that if someone dies in Varanasi, they obtain. That is what my grandfather always wanted,” said Brajesh, a journalist in Delhi. “We didn’t tell him his heart was giving up — there was 60% failure diagnosed — but he knew it was time.” Chaturbhuj, his daughter-in-law Anukula, Brajesh and two other grandsons of Chaturbhuj came to Varanasi from Delhi.The retired teacher from Motihari in Bihar had headed a strongly religious-minded household in his lifetime. “andwould be read all day,” Brajesh said. “He lost his son — my father — six months ago. Father had a cold for half an hour, suddenly got sick and died before we could get him to the hospital. He didn’t suffer much. Grandfather is really suffering …(he has survived for a month and a half now).”Brajesh was interrupted by a phone call. Chaturbhuj was trying to turn on his side. For every second of that movement, he groaned with pain. He stared at me. I could not interpret the expression — it seemed anguished. I wondered what he was thinking. But he could not speak. Not in a manner I could have understood.Later in the evening, I spoke to the most quiet member of their family, Anukula, while she was cooking for the four of them. She seemed like she was in her 60s. Had anyone else in the family said they wanted to die in Varanasi? “Just him,” she answered. Was accepting the proximity to death difficult? I asked. “I really don’t know,” she said. “He is in a lot of pain.”I had spent about half a day at Mukti Bhavan — in the morning and in the evening. For those running it, duties revolve around religious ceremonies. When I asked what they do for those about to die, Dubey said, “From 4am, there is mangal aarti. Between 5am and 6am, bhajans are sung. Around 10am, when the morning aarti end,(those seeking) are given Gangajal and tulsi leaves. This is done thrice — at 10am, 12pm and 3pm.” He continued, “In the evening,is read from 5.30pm to 6.30pm. Then, till 7.30pm, bhajans are sung. From 8pm to 9pm, there is another aarti. We wrap up by 10pm.”Who takes care of the dying? “The family,” Dubey said. And the dead? “We help the family arrange everything.”The pandemic, he said, had shut things down for a while. They didn’t have the resources to handle the surge in deaths expected with Covid-19. “Twowere here when the first lockdown was announced in March 2020. One of them got(died) in 10 days. Another felt they could get stuck, so they went back home in an ambulance,” Dubey said. The Bhavan opened again in April 2022. “Five people gotthat month, 3 in May.”Dubey has been here for nine years. He studied scriptures at his village in Bihar and then came here to make a living. Does seeing death up close every day affect him? “It is a matter of joy when someone dies in Kashi. Why should it bother me, or anyone?”We were talking in an unoccupied room. “In this room, for instance, lived a man from Buxar in Bihar. He goton May 16.” It felt melancholic to me. Not to him.The manager, Anurag Hari Shukla, said it was not sadness but a sense of lost time that catches up with people sometimes. “Some cry all night, others tell their families they should not repeat the mistakes they made. All things, bitter and sweet, flash by,” he added.“When my father used to manage the place (three generations of Shukla’s family have been managing the Bhavan), there was afrom Bihar. He asked if someone could find and bring his brother to him. They had fought over property and never reconciled. At the time of his death, he needed his brother.”Did his brother come? “Yes, with his family. They had a reunion. And then, he died happy.”“What will you do if your dead father emerges before you? Will you run to embrace him or run away in fear?” Dandiswami Jairam Ashram, a monk, asked me. I was taken aback.I had asked him what he used to do before he came to Varanasi. He was offended about the question. And I, having lost my father six months ago to a sudden cardiac arrest, was not in a mental space to hear this with any amount of objectivity. But I didn’t say anything. I was here to listen, not find an answer to my own torment ...","At mukti bhavan, those who believe they are close to death and want that to be in varanasi are provided a place to stay.

TOKYO : A man with a knife slashed two passengers waiting for a train at a Tokyo subway station during the evening rush on Wednesday, and their injuries were not believed to be life-threatening, Japanese media reported.Japan’s NHK television said the attacker was seen brandishing a kitchen knife on the platform of a station on the subway’s Namboku line. Tokyo police arrested the suspect at the scene on suspicion of attempted murder and were investigating.Police said there had been no official announcement on the still-developing case. Trains on the line were temporarily suspended for “inspection” of subway cars, operator Tokyo Metro said. Violent crime is relatively rare in Japan, which has a low murder rate and some of the toughest gun laws. But there are occasional stabbings and even shootings, including the assassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abe in 2022.","A man with a knife slashed two passengers waiting for a train at a tokyo subway station during the evening rush on wednesday.
