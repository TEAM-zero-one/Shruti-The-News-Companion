This is digital loot. We have demanded from LG that the IT department of Delhi government should immediately file an FIR, start investigation and take strict action.""The entire account was later deleted.The Delhi BJP chief further expressed his anger on social media calling for action.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of home affairs on Thursday announced that President's Rule has been imposed in Manipur. This came days after Manipur CM Biren Singh tendered his resignation to the governor of the state.""Whereas, I, Droupadi Murmu. President of India, have received a report from the Governor of the State of Manipur and after considering the report and other information received by me, I am satisfied that a situation has arisen in which the Government of that State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of India,"" the notification released by the MHA read."" Now, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred by article 356 of the Constitution. and of all other powers enabling me in that behalf, I hereby proclaim that I —(a) assume to myself as President of India all functions of the Government of the State of Manipur and all powers vested in or exercisable by the Governor of the that State,"" the notification further added.President’s Rule, imposed under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, allows the Centre to take control when a state government fails to function constitutionally. Under this rule, state powers are transferred to the Centre, and legislative functions shift to Parliament, though high courts remain unaffected. Since 1950, President’s Rule has been imposed 134 times across 29 states and Union Territories. Manipur and Uttar Pradesh have seen it most frequently, while Jammu & Kashmir holds the record for the longest duration, over 12 years.On Sunday, Biren Singh had submitted his resignation letter to Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla at the Raj Bhavan in Imphal. Singh, who headed the BJP government in the state, stepped down following ongoing political developments, and violence in the state.The ethnic violence that erupted in 2023 between the Meitei community and Kuki-Zo tribes resulted in over 250 deaths and mass displacement. Manipur's inability to control the unrest raised concerns about CM Singh's leadership. In December 2024, Singh had publicly apologised for the violence and called for reconciliation, urging communities to forgive past mistakes and rebuild peace in the state.Congress had strongly criticised resignation of Biren Singh, accusing him of instigating division in the state. Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi blamed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for allowing Singh to remain in office despite growing unrest. Gandhi said that Singh’s resignation came after mounting public pressure, a Supreme Court investigation, and a planned no-confidence motion by Congress.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh claimed Singh resigned due to the impending no-confidence motion, asserting that he no longer had majority support. Mallikarjun Kharge condemned the delayed resignation, stating it came ""after the horse had bolted"". Kharge also urged Modi to visit Manipur and hear the people's ""stories of horror.""","President’s rule, imposed under article 356 of the indian constitution, allows the centre to take control when a state government fails to function constitutionally.

NEW DELHI: The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has taken cognisance of the disturbing ragging incident at the Government Nursing College in Kottayam, Kerala, calling it “morally reprehensible” and a “severe violation of human rights.” The panel has sought a detailed action taken report from the Kerala Director General of Police (DGP) within ten days.Visuals that surfaced on Thursday showed a junior student tied to a cot, his body repeatedly pierced with a compass while being taunted and mocked by senior students. According to police, the victim was subjected to horrifying acts, including having dumbbells placed on his private parts and facial cream poured into his mouth.The NHRC, citing a complaint, noted that students from Wayanad, Malappuram, and Kottayam were involved in coercing juniors into transferring money and subjecting them to both physical and mental torture. The complaint also alleged that one student was threatened with a knife to his neck while others were bound and inflicted with sharp weapon wounds.“These actions are not only morally reprehensible but also illegal,” the NHRC observed in its proceedings, accessed by PTI.Following a complaint from one victim, five senior students—Samuel Johnson (20), Rahul Raj (22), Jeev (18), Rijil Jith (20), and Vivek (21)—were arrested and remanded to judicial custody. Police suspect there may be more victims and are recording statements to determine the extent of the abuse.The accused have been booked under the Prohibition of Ragging Act and sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, including those related to causing hurt with dangerous weapons, extortion, and criminal intimidation.Student organizations across Kerala condemned the incident. The Students' Federation of India (SFI) called it shocking, while the Kerala Students' Union (KSU) emphasized that such brutalities should not be shielded. The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) has filed complaints with the Kerala Governor, the NHRC, and the Vice-Chancellor of Kerala University of Health Sciences (KUHS), demanding a thorough inquiry.College authorities claimed they had not received complaints before February 11, with Acting Principal Dr. Sulekha A.T. stating that immediate action was taken once they were informed.

NEW DELHI: Amid apparent rift in INDIA bloc after Maharashtra and now Delhi loss, Trinamool Congress’s Abhishek Banerjee has seemingly delivered another blow to the opposition alliance.The Diamond Harbour MP hinted at a possible solo run for the party in the West Bengal polls scheduled for 2026. Banerjee suggested that TMC had performed better when contesting independently, while leaving the door open for discussions on alliances.""Didi (Mamata Banerjee) has already made it clear that we will fight alone in Bengal. This is nothing new. We fought alone in 2014, 2016, 2019, and 2024. We performed well then, and we will do so again,"" he said.""We are part of the INDIA bloc for a larger cause. But in Bengal, we have always fought alone and won. We will do it again,"" he added.While he acknowledged the importance of alliances at the national level, he said the party had historically performed well when fighting solo. However, he added, “Let’s wait, we have a lot of time.”TMC chief and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier ruled out any alliance with Congress in the state elections. According to TMC’s mouthpiece ‘Jago Bangla,’ she told party legislators, “Trinamool will return to power with a two-thirds majority in 2026. We do not need anyone’s help. We will fight alone and win alone.”Her comments prompted sharp reactions from the Congress’s West Bengal unit, which claimed that regional parties had realised their mistake of ignoring Congress after the Delhi polls. Congress leaders cited AAP’s losses in Delhi as proof that a divided opposition only helped the BJP.The BJP, meanwhile, dismissed Mamata Banerjee’s assertions, claiming that the people of Bengal were ready to reject the ruling party over alleged corruption and nepotism. BJP leaders, including Suvendu Adhikari and Sukanta Majumdar, drew comparisons between Bengal and Delhi, arguing that welfare schemes may not translate into electoral gains.Following Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury’s removal as state Congress president and the appointment of Subhankar Sarkar, speculation arose about a possible understanding between Congress and TMC. However, Mamata Banerjee firmly rejected the idea, saying, “There is no question of an alliance. Trinamool will fight alone and secure a historic victory. The Congress doesn’t have any presence in Bengal.”While the TMC, Congress, and CPI(M) are all part of the INDIA bloc at the national level, political alliances in West Bengal remain uncertain. Congress and the Left had aligned against both TMC and BJP in previous elections.BJP leaders, however, remain confident that the party will emerge victorious, regardless of TMC’s strategy. BJP leader Rahul Sinha said, “Whether TMC fights alone or with Congress, the result will be the same. The people of Bengal want to get rid of corruption and nepotism.”","Abhishek banerjee hints at a possible solo run for the party in the west bengal polls scheduled for 2026.

No need to worry about Nitish Kumar: JDU

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray on Thursday issued a warning to Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu, both key members of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA alliance at the Centre.Referencing the collapse of the Shiv Sena government—a move his party has long accused the BJP of orchestrating—Thackeray cautioned that what happened to his party could also happen to them in the future. He warned that the BJP’s ongoing campaign to weaken regional parties poses a serious threat to their political futures.He also raised concerns about alleged electoral malpractice, including voter fraud and electronic voting machine (EVM) manipulation. Ahead of meeting former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, Thackeray said, ""The future of our country is in doubt. We do not know where our vote is going amid voter fraud and EVM fraud. Are elections in India still free and fair? What happened to us, Kejriwal ji, and Congress could happen to Nitish ji, RJD, and Chandrababu ji Naidu in the future.""He accused the BJP of systematically targeting regional parties, saying, ""BJP's dream is to break up and finish off every regional party, just as they are doing with democracy in this country.""Following his meeting with Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi, Thackeray reiterated the importance of opposition unity in addressing electoral issues. ""Governments come and go, but our relationship will remain. The people of Delhi know the work Kejriwal has done over the last decade. The Election Commission played a major role in the Delhi elections. The INDIA Bloc and all opposition parties must strategise on the next steps, as elections in our democracy are no longer free and fair,"" he said.Thackeray's comments come amid growing concerns within the opposition over alleged irregularities in the electoral process. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi recently highlighted discrepancies in Maharashtra's voter registration figures, claiming that 39 lakh new voters were added in just five months after the Lok Sabha elections. He also alleged that Maharashtra's registered voter count exceeded the state's total adult population.On Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray's statement, JDU MP Sanjay Kumar Jha says, ""He has no knowledge of ground reality. The backward, Dalit, and poor communities of Bihar started voting only after the EVM was introduced. Before that, when voting used to happen using ballot paper, people used to steal the booths... He (Aaditya Thackeray) does not need to worry about JDU and Nitish Kumar...""In response to Aaditya Thackeray’s statement, JDU MP Sanjay Kumar Jha has criticised Thackeray’s understanding of the situation in Bihar. Jha stated, ""He has no knowledge of the ground reality. The backward, Dalit, and poor communities of Bihar only began voting after the introduction of the EVM. Prior to that, when ballots were used, booth capturing was rampant.""Jha further asserted that Thackeray should not be concerned about the JDU or Nitish Kumar.","Shiv sena leader aaditya thackeray warns bihar cm nitish kumar and andhra pradesh cm n chandrababu naidu that what happened to his party could happen to them in the future.

JAMMU/HAZARIBAG: Two weddings that were never meant to be. Two soldiers who gave their tomorrows so others could have theirs.In two different homes, one in Jharkhand’s Hazaribag and the other in Samba district of Jammu and Kashmir, families were preparing for April — the month when their sons, both soldiers, would become grooms. The houses were being painted, the invitations were being finalised, and dreams of a new beginning were taking shape. But fate had a cruel twist in store.Captain Karamjit Singh Bakshi , 27, and Naik Mukesh Singh Manhas , 29, were on patrol when terrorists struck near the LoC in Jammu’s Akhnoor sector Tuesday afternoon. An IED blast took them away — two young lives, two unfinished stories, two weddings that would never be.In Hazaribag, Captain Karamjit’s family was caught between anticipation and grief. Just 10 days ago, their son had visited them and broke the news of his engagement to a doctor from Army Medical Corps. April 5 was to be the beginning of his new life.His father Sardar Ajinder Singh Bakshi, a restaurateur, had been overseeing the house repairs. His mother Neelu Bakshi had begun setting aside things for the wedding. Karamjit was their only son.Now, instead of wedding guests, mourners would arrive. Instead of a bride’s entry, a tricolour-draped coffin would return home Thursday night.“He had only been in the Army for five years,” said his uncle Sardar Devinder Singh. “He had so much ahead of him.” Karmajit was attached to Punjab Regimental Centre.Far away in the border village of Bri Kamila in Samba, another family had been preparing for celebration. Naik Mukesh had spent his last holiday putting the final touches on his newly built home — meant for the wife he would bring in April. He had left on Jan 28, his wedding date nearly set for April 20-21.His father Chagatar Singh, a retired policeman, held onto memories of a son who had served more than a decade, braving the icy winds of Siachen, the turmoil of Kashmir, the vigilance of Punjab. “Youngsters in the village looked up to Mukesh,” he said. “He encouraged them to play sports, even gave them cricket and volleyball kits.”Mukesh had joined the Army in 2014 and his younger brother, also in the military, had always looked up to him. Now, the tradition of service in their village had come at an unbearable price.“Almost every home here has sent its son to the armed forces,” said villager Mukhtar Singh. “It has become a tradition.”But some sacrifices are heavier than others. In two households, wedding cards will remain undelivered. The ceremonial turbans will stay folded. The brides, once waiting in anticipation, are now bound to grief.","Captain karamjit singh bakshi, 27, and naik mukesh singh manhas, 29, were on patrol when terrorists struck near the loc in jammu’s akhnoor sector tuesday afternoon.

Spouse entitled to alimony even in void marriages: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/spouse-entitled-to-alimony-even-in-void-marriages-supreme-court/articleshow/118190734.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Wednesday ruled that a spouse involved in a void marriage like bigamy is also entitled to seek permanent alimony and maintenance from his or her partner under the Hindu Marriage Act .In view of contradictory judgments delivered on the issue of maintenance of spouse in cases of void marriage, a three-judge bench of Justices Abhay S Oka, Ahsanuddin Amanullah and Augustine George Masih passed the judgment and held that void marriages also come under the ambit of Sections 24 and 25 of Hindu Marriage Act which talks about maintenance and alimony.The marriages are void under 1995 Act: (1) If one or both the parties to the marriage have a spouse living at the time of marriage; (2) The parties to the marriage are within the degrees of prohibited relationship; and (3) The parties are sapindas of each other, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two. A sapinda relationship is based on a common ancestor within three generations on the mother's side and five generations on the father's side.""A spouse whose marriage has been declared void under Section 11 of 1955 Act is entitled to seek permanent alimony or maintenance from the other spouse by invoking Section 25 of the Act. Whether such a relief of permanent alimony can be granted or not always depends on facts of each case and the conduct of the parties. The grant of relief under Section 25 is always discretionary,"" SC said. It held that maintenance could also be granted during litigation.SC passed the order on a plea filed by a man, who submitted that there may be cases where a wife may be responsible for concealing her first marriage and induce the husband to marry. But the bench said the entitlement under Section 25 does not depend on whether the bigamous marriage is moral or immoral.SC took exception to Bombay HC full bench order for using objectionable terms for women involved in void marriage. ""...the full bench has coined the term illegitimate wife. Calling the wife of a marriage declared as void as an illegitimate wife is very inappropriate. It affects the dignity of the concerned woman.""","Supreme court rules that a spouse involved in a void marriage like bigamy is also entitled to seek permanent alimony and maintenance from his or her partner under the hindu marriage act.

Out-of-syllabus questions

erode

NTA credibility

further

NEW DELHI: A record 12 JEE-Main questions were dropped from the final answer key due to errors, the highest in recent history, raising serious concerns about the National Testing Agency 's ability to conduct a fair and transparent exam of such a large scale.Despite reducing the total number of questions from 90 to 75, the error rate surged to 1.6%, far exceeding historical 0.6% threshold. Adding to the concern is NTA's lack of transparency, with inconsistencies in its claims about the number of dropped questions, raising suspicions of ""under-reporting"" NTA DG P S Kharola did not respond to TOI questions. Education ministry has forwarded a reply from NTA that ignored syllabus discrepancy concerns, deepening scepticism about its accountability.An examination of past answer keys contradicts NTA's claims, revealing multiple instances of error-free papers in previous years. Before 2025, the highest number of dropped questions was six in Session 1 of 2024 and four in Session 2.NTA claimed that six questions were dropped in Session 1 of 2023, 2024 and 2025, but the official answer key for 2025 lists 12 dropped questions. TOI's analysis found five questions were dropped in Session 1 of 2023, while 2022's Session 1 and 2 had four and six dropped questions, respectively. No questions were dropped in the Feb and March 2021 exams. Despite this, the agency defended itself, stating, ""This year's record-low challenge rate and minimal errors reaffirm NTA's commitment to ensuring a fair, transparent, and error-free examination process for engineering aspirants nationwide.""Experts highlight that inconsistencies in language translations further erode trust in the exam process. At least two translation errors were found in the final answer key, causing confusion. Incorrect answers were later marked correct, creating additional discrepancies. Students answering in Hindi and Gujarati had two answer choices, while others had only one, raising concerns about fairness. The inclusion of out-of-syllabus questions further damaged confidence in NTA's reliability.Educators and students have expressed frustration, stating, ""In a prestigious exam like JEE, where students' futures are at stake, such incompetence is unacceptable."" Errors led to confusion, such as a logic gate question from the 22nd Shift 2 paper being dropped after being deemed invalid. Physics questions also contained errors, while translation inconsistencies and marking mistakes persisted.Despite assurances of a well-structured exam, students encountered multiple out-of-syllabus topics.""For example, the Carnot Cycle, removed from the syllabus years ago, appeared unexpectedly in the paper.

This misalignment between the syllabus and the actual exam content further added to students' distress,"" an educator lamented, adding, ""we expected a better paper this year - one without errors and irrelevant questions. Instead, we got a complete mess.""Students lost valuable time on incorrectly framed questions, with some spending 10-15 minutes struggling with ambiguous problems, affecting performance and rankings. As one student put it, ""It's not just about dropping incorrect questions - it's about the time students wasted on them. That's a huge injustice.""NTA has faced criticism for mismanaging various exams, including last year's NEET-UG and UGC-NET, which were marred by controversies over paper leak allegations and irregularities. Given past failures, expectations were high for improvements in JEE-Main 2025 . However, despite recommendations from the Radhakrishnan Committee categorising JEE-Main as a high-stakes exam, the agency appears to have repeated its mistakes. The committee stated, "" ...It is to be ensured that questions created will have uncontested answers... ""Amid these inconsistencies, JEE-Main faces serious credibility issues due to NTA's continued mismanagement and lack of accountability.","A record 12 jee-main questions were dropped from the final answer key due to errors.

Prez rule to create a neutral setting for talks in Manipur



NEW DELHI: The Centre Thursday imposed President's rule in Manipur , days after chief minister N Biren Singh stepped down and subsequent efforts at forming an alternative govt remained unsuccessful. The Manipur assembly, however, will remain in suspended animation, leaving room for formation of a govt as and when an alternative emerges.Assembly polls in Manipur, in the normal course, are due Feb 2027.President Droupadi Murmu, in the proclamation imposing President's rule, said she was ""satisfied a situation has arisen in which govt of that state cannot be carried on in accordance with provisions of the Constitution of India"".The proclamation, sources said, was issued under Rule 12 of the Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961, which allows the PM in emergency situations to depart from the requirement to get the Union Cabinet to make the recommendation for application of Article 356. With PM Narendra Modi away in the US, a meeting of the cabinet could not have been convened. Post-facto approval can be taken from the cabinet on the PM's return.There have been precedents of Rule 12 being applied with regard to President's rule in a state; the last time this was done was to revoke President's rule in Maharashtra in Nov 2019.The proclamation is likely to be placed before Parliament in the current session, when it meets post-recess, unless an alternative emerges in the interim, allowing President's rule to be revoked.While the BJP leadership appeared to be making efforts to pick a successor to Singh, it was reconciled to the prospect of the state having to be put, at least temporarily, under central rule. Perhaps, it can be helpful as the state seeks to achieve normalcy that has eluded it since May 2023.There is an assessment that placing Manipur under President’s rule — with governor Ajay Bhalla, a former home secretary who has worked under home minister Amit Shah for five years, in the saddle — almost 21 months after ethnic violence broke out, will help in creating a neutral setting for talks between Meitei and Kuki-Zo leaders to sort out issues creating mutual mistrust. Kukis, who had been resisting sitting across the table with Singh in the lead, are expected to soften their stance and come forward for substantive talks to bring lasting peace.The fast-paced political developments in Manipur come amid the assessment that Singh’s own support among MLAs and Manipuri people had dwindled over time. There is a sense that people of the state, both from Meitei-dominated Valley and hills occupied by Kuki-Zo, are tired of the prolonged conflict and failure of Biren Singh govt to curb it and now want a decisive leadership to broker peace.","The manipur assembly will remain in suspended animation, leaving room for formation of a govt as and when an alternative emerges.

SC sets aside ‘casual and cavalier’ bail order of HC



NEW DELHI: Observing that the offence of money laundering posed serious threat not only to the financial systems of the country but also to its integrity and sovereignty and could not be regarded as an ordinary crime, Supreme Court on Thursday said courts should refrain from taking a casual or cursory approach while granting bail as it should be given only when the twin conditions under PMLA are fulfilled.A bench of Justices Bela M Trivedi and Prasanna B Varale said the burden was on the accused to prove that he was not involved in generating proceeds of crime . The bench set aside the order of Patna high court granting bail to an accused and directed him to surrender.The apex court’s order is significant as it comes against the backdrop of a series of orders by different courts seeking to extend “bail is the norm, jail an exception” principle to PMLA cases.Section 45 (of PMLA) imposes two conditions for grant of bail to any person accused of an offence punishable for a term of imprisonment of more than three years under Part A of the Schedule. The two conditions are that (i) the prosecutor must be given an opportunity to oppose the application for bail; and (ii) the court must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused person is not guilty of such offence and that he is not liable to commit any offence while on bail. As well settled, these two conditions are mandatory in nature and they need to be complied with before the accused person is released on bail,” the bench said.Setting aside the bail order, the bench said HC passed the order in a “very casual and cavalier manner”, without considering the rigours of Section 45 and there was no finding that there were reasonable grounds for believing that the respondent was not guilty of the alleged offence under the Act and that he was not likely to commit any offence while on bail.“The offence of money laundering is not an ordinary offence. It has been regarded as an aggravated form of crime world over and the offenders involved connected with the proceeds of crime are treated as a separate class from ordinary criminals. Any casual or cursory approach by courts while considering the bail application of the offender and granting him bail by passing cryptic orders without considering the seriousness of the crime and without considering the rigours of Section 45 cannot be vindicated,” the bench said.“It is a very serious offence which is committed by an individual with a deliberate desire and the motive to enhance his gains, disregard ing the interest of the nation and the society as a whole, and such offence by no stretch of imagination can be regarded as an offence of trivial nature. The stringent provisions have been made in the Act to combat the menace of money laundering,” it added.The bench said Section 24 provides that in case a person is charged with the offence of money laundering, the authority or court shall, unless the contrary is proved, presume that such proceeds of crime are involved in money laundering. “Therefore, the burden to prove that proceeds of crime are not involved in money laundering would lie on the person charged with the offence,” the bench said.In this case, accused Kanhaiya Prasad , who is the son of politician Radha Charan Sah, was arrested in Sept 2023 and was granted bail by HC in May 2024. As per ED, both father and son were involved in illegal sand mining in Bihar.",Supreme court sets aside ‘casual and cavalier’ bail order of hc of patna.

NEW DELHI: The share of young electors aged 18-29 years in Kerala, at just over 18% of its total electorate in 2024 Lok Sabha polls , was the lowest among all states/UTs. However, the southern state also had the highest share of electors in 60-79 years age bracket, at 20.5%.These statistics are part of 'Atlas on general elections to Lok Sabha 2024' unveiled by EC Wednesday.For comparison, electors in the 18-29 age group comprised 22.8% of the national electorate as on May 20, 2024, while the all-India share of those in the age bracket of 60-79 years was 14.7%.Among the bigger states, Assam had the highest percentage of electors in the 18-29 years bracket, at nearly 30%, followed by Jharkhand with 28.4%, on May 20, 2024. Delhi electorate had the highest share of voters aged between 30 and 59 years, at nearly 66%, which is way higher than the national average of 60.6%.As per the atlas - released by chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar, flanked by election commissioners Gyanesh Kumar and Sukhbir Singh Sandhu - 310 or 57% of the 542 Lok Sabha constituencies that went to polls last year (not counting Surat where BJP candidate was elected unopposed) had a winning margin of more than one lakh votes, while only 39 had a margin of less than 20,000 votes.Only two parliamentary constituencies, Mumbai North West in Maharashtra and Attingal in Kerala, had the winning margin of less than 1,000 votes, while the winner across 18 constituencies was ahead of the runner-up by over five lakh votes. In Tamil Nadu, the margin was more than one lakh across 33 of total 39 seats. CEC Kumar, while releasing the atlas, said the system of poll data is robust with in-buit ""red flags"" which ensure that ""nothing can go wrong"".Though the voteshare of NOTA option fell to 0.99% from 1.06% in 2019 and 1.08% in 2014, the percentage of NOTA votes in Bihar, at over 2% was more than double the national average, while Nagaland polled the least NOTA votes at 0.2%.

Powerful

spiritual force

aided

Silkyara rescue

, says Australian

tunnelling expert

DEHRADUN: Arnold Dix was in Germany when the first call came. Then another, in Slovenia. The news was urgent - a tunnel collapse in Uttarakhand had left 41 workers stranded. Their survival depended on whether a narrow passage could be drilled through layers of hard rock and debris before time ran out. He didn't hesitate. ""I was asked to join the team working to rescue the trapped workers. Without a second thought, I boarded a flight to India,"" he said.He arrived in Uttarkashi on Nov 20, eight days after the collapse. By then, frustration had begun to seep into the operation. A nation watched as engineers, officials, and workers clawed at the earth, racing against time.Dix, a tunnelling expert from Australia and president of International Tunnelling & Underground Space Association, was a man of engineering, precision, and numbers - he wasn't built to believe in things he couldn't measure. But standing at the mouth of that collapsed tunnel, surrounded by exhaustion & failure, he felt the unshakable presence of something heavier than rock. ""I'm a rational man,"" he told TOI, ""But I am of the firm belief that a powerful spiritual force also played a crucial role in saving the 41 men."" The experience changed him profoundly.As days went by without a substantial breakthrough, Dix knew he had to shift the way they worked. The white hard hat of ""management people"" came off. The yellow helmet of the workers came on. ""With the blessing of Baba Baukhnag , whose temple was near the tunnel, I wore that yellow hat with conviction. We would save them,"" he said.For a moment, it wasn't engineering that defined the rescue. It was belief.The auger machine was their best chance. On Day 14, it failed. It wasn't a slow breakdown. It was abrupt. A hard stop. The team deflated. The energy on-site sagged. He had seen this before - the point in a disaster where exhaustion sets in and hope begins to fray. ""I changed my hat, kept their spirits high, and reminded them that we would bring those men to safety before Christmas.""On his flight to India, somewhere above the Arabian Sea, he had been reading about Kali - goddess of time, doomsday, justice, and death. ""The more I read, the more she made sense to me,"" he wrote in his book 'The Promise', released last week. At the mouth of the tunnel, he thought about her again. ""My first time in the tunnel was overwhelming. This was a much bigger mess than I could have possibly imagined,"" he wrote.On Nov 28, the last slab of rock was cleared. Leaders of the operation, including Dix, were hailed as heroes. But for him, the experience did not end at the tunnel's mouth. It followed him across continents. He studies Sanskrit now. Has faith in things he once dismissed. Carries with him the yellow helmet - not as a souvenir, but as something else. A marker. A threshold. A reminder that sometimes, numbers aren't enough.","Arnold dix was a tunnelling expert from australia and president of international tunnelling & underground space association.

A mourning ritual turned into community feast in celebration



PRAYAGRAJ: To the list of superstitions linked with 'unlucky' 13 has been added the lucky coincidence of a presumed Maha Kumbh stampede victim from Prayagraj trudging back home this Tuesday to find the neighbourhood commemorating his 'tehrvi' - the ritual performed on 13th day after a death.Turns out 60-something Khunti Guru , nonplussed at the fuss over his rumoured death in the Jan 29 stampede, had had one chillum of ganja too many with some sadhus and lost track of time.Almost two weeks would go by before he remembered that his 10x12 room in Chahchand Gali of Prayagraj's Zero Road was waiting for him. By then, Khunti Guru's extended family comprising almost the entire locality had organised elaborate religious rituals in memory of the much-loved local jester.""I slept rather long... could be a few days,"" the 'Dead Man Walking' said, responding to the barrage of questions and curious looks that greeted his arrival. Khunti Guru's tehrvi was quickly forgotten in the euphoria of seeing him alive, but not the food. What was meant to be a mourning ritual turned into community feasting in celebration of the popular, happy-go-lucky character's 'rebirth'.Abhai Awasthi, a social worker, said Khunti Guru, stepped out on the evening of Jan 28, telling whomever he met in Chahchand Gali that he would be back after a dip at Sangam on Mauni Amavasya .""The stampede happened early the next day and we got worried about him. We looked for him everywhere we could but there was no trace of him. Finally, presuming him dead, we organised prayers for him,"" Awasthi told TOI.Just as the rituals were nearing completion, a familiar figure alighted from an e-rickshaw. ""Our beloved Khunti Guru asked us smilingly, ""What are you people up to?' It's hard describing how we felt,"" Awasthi said.Locals say his father, Kanhaiyala Mishra, was a reputable lawyer. Not much is known about what happened to the family but Khunti Guru apparently didn't complete his education and stayed back in the area.The room he now lives in is apparently what remains of the Mishra family's ancestral home. Shopkeepers in the neighbourhood give him food and clothing in return for their daily fix of gossip, peppered with anecdotes delivered in Khunti Guru's inimitable style. ""Although he has a bed in his room, Khunti Guru prefers sleeping in the compound of a local Shiva temple,"" a resident said.","Maha kumbh stampede victim from prayagraj trudging back home to find neighbourhood commemorating his 'tehrvi' - the ritual performed on 13th day after a death.

Statement of suicide victim's father weakens prosecution argument



CHENNAI: One girl, two suitors. But the unspoken battle for her loyalty simmered beneath the surface until it boiled over and the 19-year-old engineering student in Tamil Nadu's Kattankulathur town ended her life on July 14, 2014.The tragedy sent the two men accused of abetting her suicide into a decade-long legal battle, only to be acquitted for lack of evidence this February 10. E Sumithra, a first-year student at a private college, was found dead in her bedroom by her parents. Her death followed a heated confrontation between her fiance M Anandhan and her close friend K Ilayaraaja.Victim Sumithra's fiance M Anandhan and her close friend K Ilayaraaja had expressed romantic interest in her.Sumithra was engaged to Anandhan, a classmate and relative, with family approval. However, Ilayaraaja, a neighbour and long-time friend, also proposed marriage. Though she declined his proposal, she remained in touch with him, leading to tensions between the two men.On the night of July 13, Anandhan and Ilayaraaja had a heated argument near the college, requiring bystanders to intervene. That night, both called Sumithra repeatedly, allegedly pressuring her to sever ties with the other. The calls allegedly continued from midnight until 6am. The next morning, she was found dead.Police conducted an inquiry and filed an abetment case against Anandhan and Ilayaraaja, then aged 23 and 24. However, when the case went to trial at Chengalpet Mahila Court, Judge M Ezhilarasi found serious gaps in the prosecution's claims.In his complaint, Sumithra's father Ezhumalai said: ""I do not know why my daughter took her life."" His statement weakened the prosecution's argument that harassment drove her to suicide.Sumithra's close friend Vaishali, a key prosecution witness, denied in court that she had expressed distress about being pressured by the two men. The prosecution also failed to produce crucial call detail records (CDR) to verify the claim that both men had pressured Sumithra over the phone that night. Without this evidence, the court ruled that the allegations remained unproven.After a trial spanning nearly 10 years, the court acquitted both Anandhan and Ilayaraaja, citing lack of credible evidence, call records or witnesses supporting the abetment charge. Yet, beyond the walls of justice, in the stillness of a home that once echoed with a daughter's laughter, one question lingered unanswered: What truly happened that night?","E sumithra, a first-year student at a private college, was found dead in her bedroom by her parents.
