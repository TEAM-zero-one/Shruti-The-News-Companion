NEW DELHI: The Karnataka High Court dismissed a ""frivolous"" criminal case on Tuesday against a man accused of stealing a cat named 'Daisy'.During the post-lunch hearing, Justice M Nagaprasanna commented with amusement: ""Cat named Daisy has driven everyone crazy"".The proceedings against Taha Husain were terminated after he stated that his neighbour had lodged a false police complaint accusing him of taking her cat.The petitioner approached the high court in 2023 to dismiss the case, which was heard on July 23, 2024. Justice Nagaprasanna provided temporary relief by suspending all legal actions against Husain.The court stated: ""Permitting further proceedings in such frivolous cases will clog the criminal justice system.""In July 2024, police filed a chargesheet following the FIR. Husain faced charges under Sections 504, 506 and 509 of the Indian Penal Code for criminal intimidation, breach of peace, and insulting the modesty of woman. The police cited CCTV evidence showing the cat inside Husain's residence at a particular time.The defence lawyer argued that cats naturally enter and leave houses through windows, which should not be considered a criminal act.","Karnataka high court dismisses a ""frivolous"" criminal case against a man.

Yes, timely support makes a difference No, some outcomes are unavoidable

LUCKNOW/SHILLONG/INDORE: First, it was a case of missing honeymooners in Meghalaya. They might have lost their way on a trek, it was thought.On June 2, as Raja Raghuvanshi's body was found in a gorge, it was suspected to be a robbery gone wrong. A 'dao' (machete) and phone lay near his body, and a blood-stained raincoat found a few kilometres away. His gold ring and chain, it turned out, were missing. As cops dug deeper, the case took a chilling turn.Also read: ‘Happy to marry whoever you choose,’ Sonam had told father Police formed an SIT with SDRF, NDRF, and central and state intelligence units to crack what became a nationwide sensation. Both families demanded a CBI probe. Even after cops claimed to have cracked the case Monday and arrested Raghuvanshi's bride, Sonam, from a dhaba in UP, and four suspects, including her alleged lover Raj Kushwaha, the stories kept coming. She initially told Ghazipur police that miscreants robbed and killed Raja near the falls, but refused to disclose where she had been or how she escaped.""I didn't kill my husband. They killed him for the jewellery,"" Sonam said, referring to the four arrested men. Those were Akash Rajput, 21, from Lalitpur (UP), Vishal Singh Chauhan, 22, and Kushwaha, 21, both from Indore, and Anand Kurmi, 23, from Satna in MP.Indore additional DCP Rajesh Dandotiya said Akash, Vishal and Raj were produced in court and sent on seven-day transit remand.Anand is being brought to Indore & will be presented in court Tuesday.Raj, suspected to be the prime co-conspirator, used to live near Sonam's home and worked as an accountant in Sonam's family business. He moved away a year ago but remained employed. Police claimed Sonam's family was against her relationship with Raj. Eventually, her marriage was arranged with Raja through a Kushwaha community network.Just four days after her wedding, Sonam returned to her parental home for a post-marriage ritual. She allegedly plotted her husband's murder with Raj during that visit. The plot, investigators alleged, was to eliminate him in the next few days so she could reunite with Raj.East Khasi Hills SP Vivek Syiem alleged Sonam had been sending her location to Raj throughout the trip. Investigators believe the killers trailed the couple after they visited Kamakhya temple in Guwahati. Raj remained in Indore, while Akash, Vishal and Anand travelled by train to Assam, police alleged.""The murder weapon was purchased in Guwahati,"" an officer in Indore said. Sonam reportedly pushed Raja to extend their stay in Shillong - a move now seen as part of a premeditated plan.Tourist guide Albert Pde told investigators he saw the couple with three Hindi-speaking men on May 23 as they climbed 3,000 steps from Nongriat to Mawlakhiat. That detail was key - pointing to outsiders shadowing the honeymooners.""All the dots connected to indicate that there was prior planning,"" SP Syiem said. ""We will confirm everything once the accused are interrogated together."" Sonam's parents dismissed the allegations. Her father Devi Singh said his daughter is being ""framed"" by police.","Raja raghuvanshi's body was found in a gorge in meghalaya on june 2.

How former ICICI Bank relationship manager committed fraud: 10 Points

The investigation revealed that Sakshi Gupta had gained unauthorised access to more than 110 accounts of 41 customers and executed multiple illegal transactions.

Investigators found that she had diverted the misappropriated funds into stock market investments, which subsequently resulted in substantial financial losses.

In order to hide the deception, Gupta allegedly substituted the registered mobile numbers of various bank accounts with those of her family members.

The actual account holders were unable to receive transaction notifications and one-time passwords (OTPs) due to this modification, according to police reports.

The investigation revealed multiple fraudulent activities by Gupta, including unauthorised activation of overdraft facilities across 40 accounts.

Further findings showed that she had unlawfully terminated fixed deposits belonging to 31 clients, channeling Rs 1.34 crore to different accounts.

The probe uncovered her unauthorised usage of debit cards, along with their associated PINs and OTPs, to conduct various online and ATM transactions.

Additionally, Gupta was found responsible for processing a fraudulent personal loan amounting to Rs 3.4 lakh.

The investigation also established that she had extensively utilised Insta Kiosk machines and digital banking platforms to execute numerous fraudulent transactions.

The illicit funds were distributed across several Demat accounts, suggesting an attempt to conceal the money trail.

Rs 4.58 crore siphoned off - over 100 accounts of customers accessed - fixed deposits broken: This is not some movie plot - it’s a stunning fraud that a former ICICI Bank relationship manager pulled off! The multi-crore fraud continued for over two years.The accused, Sakshi Gupta, who served at ICICI Bank ’s Shriram Nagar branch in Kota's DCM area from 2020 to 2023, was taken into custody by Udhyog Nagar police on May 31, 2025 after a thorough investigation.According to a TOI report, police records indicate that the fraudulent activities were initially discovered on February 18.Following ICICI Bank's internal probe that identified Sakshi Gupta, who previously worked as a relationship manager at the bank's DCM branch in Kota, as the primary suspect in a significant financial fraud affecting customer accounts, the Kota police have begun their enquiry. The authorities are examining potential accomplices and have asked the bank to furnish pertinent documentation.After identifying irregularities, bank manager Tarun Dadhich registered a complaint, which led to a comprehensive audit and subsequent police investigation.""She systematically transferred funds, sometimes using the account of an elderly woman who had no knowledge of the activity as a pool account,"" said sub-inspector Ibrahim of Udhyog Nagar police station.""By mid-February 2023, over Rs 3 crore had passed through that single account.""Following a one-day police custody, Gupta appeared before the court and was sent to judicial custody. The police continue their enquiries into the matter.A representative from ICICI Bank said, ""The interest of our customers are of paramount importance to us. Immediately upon discovering the fraudulent activity, we filed an FIR with the police. We have a zero-tolerance policy against any fraudulent activity and thus suspended the employee involved. We would like to reassure that genuine claims of impacted customers have been settled.""","Sakshi gupta had gained unauthorised access to more than 110 accounts of 41 customers.

All new ACs to come with minimum temp setting of 20 degrees C,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/all-new-acs-to-come-with-minimum-temp-setting-of-20-degrees-c/articleshow/121759311.cms,"NEW DELHI: Soon all new air-conditioners (ACs) will come with a minimum temperature setting of 20 degrees centigrade (degrees C) instead of 16 or 18 degrees and a maximum of 28 degrees against 30 degrees at present, a move that can potentially result in savings of Rs 18,000-20,000 crore for consumers in three years once the mandate becomes effective.Describing it as a “uniqe experiment”, power minister Manohar Lal on Tuesday said the new mandate for AC makers will improve efficiency in cooling operations, mitigating the surge in power demand and electricity bills as summers get hotter.As and when the new norms are notified, the new mandate will apply to air-conditioners used across sectors — from domestic to commercial establishments such as office blocks, malls, hotels and movie theatres, which often run their units at the lowest setting.The ‘experiment’ appears to be inspired by similar moves in Italy and Japan. While Rome has fixed the lowest temperature setting for public buildings at 23 degrees C, Japan follows a fixed temperature of 27 degrees C.Government data indicate that every 1 degree C increase in temperature setting for cooling reduces power consumption by 6%. They also show that if 6 crore urban households and 12 lakh commercial establishments keep their AC setting between 22 and 24 degrees C, it will save 12-15 billion units of power annually and do away the need to build 4-5 coal-fired power plants and substantially reduce carbon emission.Industry bodies representing the manufacturers said the move will raise their R&D expenses but also push up demand for more efficient units, which usually cost more.Based on a 2018 Bureau of Energy Efficiency study, the government had in 2020 mandated a default setting of 24 degrees C for air-conditioners and suggested running the units at 26-27 degrees C, a temperature level it described as healthy.In October 2023, the International Energy Agency said India's demand for electricity from household air-conditioners will increase significantly by 2050, potentially exceeding total power consumption in Africa. It also anticipated India will experience the highest energy demand growth globally over the next three decades, driven by rising incomes and a warming climate.GoThe minister also announced a Rs 5,400 crore VGF funding for 30 gigawatt of battery storage projects and extending the waiver of inter-state transmission charges for green power till June 28, 2028. These decisions are expected to spur investments of Rs 33,000 crore in the battery storage projects and prove to be a boon for Rs 1 lakh crore worth of green transmission projects underway.",All new air-conditioners will come with a minimum temperature setting of 20 degrees centigrade (degrees c) instead of 16 or 18 degrees and a maximum of 28 degrees against 30 degrees at present.

That was the first clue.Meghalaya Police SIT began suspecting foul play when they noticed newlyweds Raja & Sonam Raghuvanshi hadn't posted any pictures from their scenic trip to the northeast. That silence online opened the lid on what turned out to be a planned murder - a case codenamed unofficially by police as Operation Honeymoon.Raja Raghuvanshi, 28, a transporter from Indore, was found dead on June 2 in a gorge near Weisawdong Falls in Meghalaya's East Khasi Hills. He had disappeared on May 23 along with 24-year-old Sonam, who reappeared at a roadside dhaba in UP's Ghazipur in the early hours of June 9. She was arrested, brought to Shillong Tuesday, and will be produced before a court on Wednesday.he couple had married on May 11 and left days later for Guwahati, telling family they planned to visit the Kamakhya temple. On May 20, they reached Meghalaya. Three days later, both vanished. A rented scooter, abandoned near Shillong-Cherrapunji route, was found on May 24. It would take a nine-day search to locate Raja's body. A ""dao"" (machete) and phone lay nearby, with a blood-stained raincoat found a few km away.As SIT sifted through 42 surveillance videos and behaviour profiles, suspicions deepened. Footage placed Sonam meeting the alleged killers just 10km from the crime scene. The clincher came when a social media post appeared on Raja's account at 2.15am - hours after his death. Police said it was a red herring, likely posted by someone else to throw investigators off track.The conspiracy began well before the trip. Sonam, who returned to her parental home on May 15, allegedly resumed contact with her alleged lover Raj Kushwaha. Next day, Raj allegedly met three childhood friends - Akash Rajput, Vishal Singh Chauhan, and Anand Kurmi - at a restaurant in Indore. The murder plan was allegedly sealed that evening.Raj stayed behind in Indore. The three boarded a train to Guwahati via Delhi and arrived in Shillong on May 21, police said. For the next two days, they allegedly tailed the couple with help from Sonam, who kept sending live locations.

KOCHI: Kerala high court on Tuesday issued notice to Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra seeking her response to a petition challenging her election from the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency in the Nov 2024 byelection.Justice K Babu admitted the election petition filed by BJP candidate Navya Haridas seeking Priyanka's election to be declared void, and posted it for further hearing in Aug.In her petition, Haridas has accused Priyanka of corrupt practices and suppression or non-disclosure of several immovable properties owned by her and her spouse, Robert Vadra, in the affidavit submitted along with her nomination papers.The petition alleges that Priyanka suppressed vital information regarding assets owned by her and her family, thereby misleading and misinforming voters and keeping them in the dark to influence their electoral choice. This, the petitioner contends, amounts to corrupt practices under the Representation of the People Act, 1951. The petition also alleges that Priyanka's nomination papers violated election laws and the Conduct of Election Rules.In the byelection, necessitated by Rahul Gandhi vacating the seat in favour of Rae Bareli, Priyanka secured her maiden electoral victory with a margin exceeding four lakh votes. She polled 6,22,338 votes while LDF candidate Sathyan Mokeri secured 2,11,407 votes.

INDORE/LUCKNOW: Madhya Pradesh police claimed Tuesday Sonam Raghuvanshi had returned to Indore days after her husband's murder in Meghalaya, met her alleged lover in a rented room, and plotted her next move before resurfacing 2,000km away - dazed and dishevelled at a dhaba in eastern UP.Also read: Sonam paid Rs 50k for killers’ travel; 2 accused have confessed, say police Sonam, 24, had vanished on May 23 near Wei Sawdong Falls in East Khasi Hills, where she and her husband Raja Raghuvanshi, 28, had travelled on a sudden honeymoon. On June 2, Raja's body was found in a gorge near the falls' parking lot. She remained missing. Her reappearance in Ghazipur on June 9 deepened the mystery. Indore police said she was never abducted as she claimed. ""We have information that Sonam reached Indore between May 25 and May 27 by train and stayed in a rented room in Dewas Gate,"" additional DCP (Crime Branch) Rajesh Dandotiya said. ""Raj Kushwaha, her co-accused, met her there. He later arranged a taxi to UP.""Police didn’t explain why she was sent to Uttar Pradesh. CCTV footage is being examined to track her route, which investigators said was deliberately confusing. Railway records show she may have taken a train from Guwahati to Patna after May 23-24, dodging flight records and misleading police.A senior UP officer said: “We have CCTV footage of her getting off a Guwahati-Patna train. The route was chosen to misguide investigators.”The 15-day gap between Raja’s death and Sonam’s arrest is being described by police as a calculated effort to fabricate a tale of trauma-induced amnesia. At the Ghazipur One-Stop Centre, a govt support shelter, she reportedly slept for seven of her 15 hours there, avoided doctors and police, and repeated: “Mujhe kuch yaad nahi hai (I don’t remember anything).”Her appearance — swollen face, messy hair, quiet demeanour — baffled the staff. “She looked nothing like a bride. No grief, no mention of husband. Just fatigue and sleepiness,” said a woman officer.According to Indore police, the murder conspiracy was hatched on May 17, six days after the wedding and three days before the trip. Sonam had returned to her parental home on May 15, and reconnected with Raj on another SIM. They spoke for hours on May 16. The next day, Raj allegedly met three childhood friends — Akash Rajput, Vishal Singh Chauhan, and Anand Kurmi — at a restaurant in Indore’s Super Corridor, where the killing was planned.The trio left Indore on a train to Guwahati via New Delhi, reached Shillong on May 21, and allegedly shadowed the couple using a rental car. Sonam sent live locations, lured Raja to isolated spots for photos, and waited for the right moment, police alleged.“They tried to push him off a cliff in a forest first, but it didn’t work out,” said an officer in Indore. “Instead, the attackers used a machete bought in Guwahati and hacked Raja to death in a remote area, as Sonam watched.”Sonam’s phone records and messages to Raj contradict her claims of memory loss and captivity, UP police said. Her silence under questioning, indifferent behaviour, and elaborate route back to UP point to a calculated escape rather than trauma, investigators added.",Sonam raghuvanshi had vanished on may 23 near wei sawdong falls in east khasi hills.

NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: The much-anticipated meeting on Tuesday between the Congress high command, CM Siddaramaiah and DCM DK Shivakumar to discuss alleged lapses that led to the stampede outside cricket stadium resulted in putting up a united front with the party leadership backing its govt. However, the main takeaway from the meeting was that a fresh caste enumeration would be taken up in the state.The meeting, attended by AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge, leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi, AICC general secretaries Randeep Singh Surjewala and KC Venugopal, saw the high command accepting the action taken by the govt in the aftermath of the tragedy.""The CM and PCC chief briefed the leadership about the incident and the action taken post incident.

""We do believe there may be a portfolio reshuffle with controversy-ridden ministers being asked to change their departments,"" said a legislator.The top among the portfolios that are likely to see a change, if any, would be the home department and excise department, both of whose ministers have been in the news for the wrong reasons.","The meeting was attended by aicc president mallikarjun kharge, leader of opposition rahul gandhi.

NEET-UG remains the gateway for over 20 lakh students aspiring to get into MBBS, BDS, and other UG medical courses.In Sikar and Gujarat, candidates received faulty booklets with jumbled page numbers. For example, students who received Paper Code 47 in Sikar found that pages of the question paper were not in order. In Gujarat, particularly in Jamnagar, candidates using Gujarati-medium Paper Code 48 faced the same issue.Due to incorrect sequence of pages in question paper - like question 7 being followed by question 15 - some candidates said they darkened the circle for the wrong question. Others said valuable time was lost trying to figure out the correct corresponding circles on the answer sheet.Following the exam, guardians submitted formal complaints to Gujarat govt and NTA, attaching scanned copies of the faulty booklets as proof. ""Students even raised the issue during the test but were told to solve the faulty paper,"" a parent wrote. A state official confirmed the receipt of such complaints.NTA has declined to comment on the Sikar case, stating the matter is sub judice.Examinees and coaching experts also flagged certain questions as being beyond the medical syllabus.

The answer keys have been published and objections invited from candidates. These will be reviewed by a committee of subject experts"".
