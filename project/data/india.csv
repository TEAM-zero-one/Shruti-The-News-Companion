RAJKOT: A court in Dhoraji town, in Gujarat's Rajkot district, found a 22-year-old man guilty of raping a 14-year-old girl despite his DNA not matching her fetus; the conviction was based on other evidence and the survivor's statement.At the same time, the court, in its recent order, also ordered the Rajkot SP to conduct a departmental inquiry against the investigating officer (IO) for failure to probe two other suspected perpetrators named as her friends in the complaint lodged by the girl's aunt. Himkar Singh, SP, Rajkot, told TOI, ""According to the court's order, I have entrusted ASP Simran Bharadwaj with the departmental inquiry against the IO of the case.""

KANPUR: The phone rang in a small home in Goyera Mughli village of Banda in UP's Bundelkhand. It was February 15. A voice - familiar yet carrying the weight of impending finality - broke the silence. ""This is my last call,"" said Shahzadi Khan , 33.A hush fell over her family. Her brother Shamsher gripped the phone tighter. ""They asked me about my final wish,"" she said, further adding, ""I asked to speak to ammi and abbu.""Her mother gasped in the background, reaching for a daughter who was facing execution after being convicted of murdering a four-month-old child thousands of miles away in Abu Dhabi - too far to hold, too close to lose.

""We filed a writ petition in Delhi high court, where we were informed Monday about her execution,"" the brother said.Executed on February 15 - the same day she made her last call. No one knew how. No one knew where her remains lay. Only that it was over. ""Her last rites will be held on March 5,"" additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma said in court.She had left India in search of healing. ""Shahzadi had childhood burn scars on her face,"" said her brother. The scars had always made her self-conscious. ""She wanted to have them removed,"" Shamsher said. When a man named Uzair from Agra reached out on social media, promising help - a chance for plastic surgery in UAE - she dared to dream.She reached Abu Dhabi in Dec 2021 on a legal visa. Upon arrival, Uzair sent her to the home of his relative Faiz, where she was kept as a domestic worker. No surgery, no transformation - only labour and confinement in an unfamiliar world.In Aug 2022, Faiz's wife gave birth to a son and Shahzadi was assigned as the baby's caregiver. Four months later, on Dec 7, the child received routine vaccinations. By nightfall, he was gone.Fazi's grief turned to fury. Shahzadi was accused of killing the infant.

"Bogged down by internal issues, Mayawati appears uninterested in rebuilding BSP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bogged-down-by-internal-issues-mayawati-appears-uninterested-in-rebuilding-bsp/articleshow/118692498.cms,"BSP supremo Mayawati’s key decisions, like snapping the alliance with SP immediately after 2019 Lok Sabha results, triggered speculation that extraneous factors like govt pressure over her legal woes were dictating her moves

NEW DELHI: The expulsion of heir apparent Akash Anand from BSP, after having been appointed and sacked as the party face twice in less than a year, is emblematic of the fall in the Dalit outfit's fortunes.The party was reduced to a solitary seat out of 403 in UP assembly in 2022 elections and then failed to win any of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state in 2024, even as its cadre and mid-rung leaders have streamed into rival SP in good numbers, boosting the strength of Akhilesh Yadav's ranks while also benefitting BJP in pockets.That encapsulates the misery of BSP over last five years - confusion at the top and erosion at the bottom. How did the party, once imperious in its appeal and strength and the byword for Dalit assertion, reach this miserable stage is difficult to fathom. But as it came after BJP's romp in UP in 2014 LS and 2017 assembly polls, Mayawati's key decisions like snapping the alliance with SP immediately after the 2019 Lok Sabha results in which it managed to win 10 seats, triggered speculation that extraneous factors like govt pressure over her legal woes were dictating her moves. Its choice of candidates in select constituencies in successive elections, which were seen as seeking to damage the BJP's rivals, only fanned the suspicion.As it stands today, BSP is without much of its votebase and without any legislative strength, while rivals BJP and SP both have benefitted from its fading from the scene. The 2024 LS polls have shown strong evidence that SP may emerge as a key destination for Dalit cadre, who are being wooed by BSP turncoats now leading the charge from Samajwadi benches.To many observers, signs of ""behenji"" bogged down in internal issues like succession, and suspicion of successors, instead of focusing on making a deft attempt at recouping the lost base suggests a distracted leader not keen on rebuilding. This is a confirmation of the party's obituaries that emerged in the wake of the 2022 UP election disaster. Few, including close followers, are willing to give the BSP another chance at re-emergence, despite the party retaining a wistful goodwill among its core vote base that is drifting to other options.As a labour of love of the tireless Kanshi Ram, BSP was a trailblazer, the first of the political platforms of Dalits which captured the imagination of the downtrodden and then showed enough realpolitik to become an indispensable political player. Anchored in the largest state of UP, it had appeal across states and became a sub-regional force in many of them. If it was not a player, it was a good enough spoiler. And if it was not a political choice of social groups, it asserted itself as a moral authority on emancipation. Now, BSP risks being nothing than a spent force all around.",The expulsion of heir apparent akash anand from bsp is emblematic of the fall in the dalit outfit's fortunes.

ROHTAK: Haryana Police on Monday arrested one accused in connection with the murder of Congress worker Himani Narwal , whose body was found inside a suitcase near a highway in Rohtak on March 1.According to police officials, the investigation led to the identification and subsequent arrest of the suspect involved in the crime.Further details regarding the accused and the motive behind the murder are yet to be disclosed.Himani’s body was discovered inside a suitcase near Sampla bus stand in Rohtak on Saturday morning, three days after she went missing. According to the police, she had been living alone at her ancestral home in Vijayanagar, Rohtak, for the past five months and had attended a wedding last week.Earlier in the day, Savita Devi reached the mortuary ahead of Himani’s postmortem and expressed dissatisfaction with the police investigation. She also raised suspicions about the role of Congress members, claiming her daughter’s success had made her a target. ""Some people were envious of her progress,"" she alleged, adding that she would not allow Himani’s last rites until the culprits were arrested.SHO Bijender Singh of Sampla police station stated that CCTV footage from National Highway-9, covering the 25-km stretch between Rohtak and Rohad toll plaza, is being examined. Surveillance footage from hotels and roadside eateries is also under review to track the perpetrators. Additionally, police are analyzing CCTV cameras along the route between Himani’s home and Sampla bus stand.Savita Devi recalled that Himani had walked alongside Rahul Gandhi during the Bharat Jodo Yatra in Jammu and Kashmir, but after the elections, she became disillusioned with politics.

At present, the govt claims to operate 590 buses from KCBT.""We often wait 15 to 20 minutes for a bus in the early hours when returning to Chennai after holidays, only to find overcrowded MTC buses.

The problem is worsened by autos encroaching on the left-most lanes. On the opposite side, govt buses are often forced to stop in the middle of the road to drop passengers, despite a designated bus bay.By shifting mofussil bus operations to Kilambakkam, police expect smoother movement of MTC buses and local vehicles through the area, where traffic delays of 10 to 15 minutes have become routine.","Starting tuesday, all govt mofussil buses from southern districts will terminate at kilambakkam instead of tambaram.

NEW DELHI: A couple arrested by ED from Punjab on Friday, who had masterminded a multi-level marketing fraud by duping investors with promises of handsome rental value on purchase of cloud space & leasing it back, has been remanded in ED custody.On Saturday, a special PMLA court in Jalandhar remanded Sukhvinder Singh Kharour to 10 days and Dimple Kharour to five days in ED custody. They allegedly collected over Rs 3,500 crore in past 2-3 years and siphoned off the ""proceeds of crime"".Look out notices were issued after they went underground. At least 26 luxury cars worth Rs 80 crore (belonging to the couple) were seized by ED last month. ED also attached other assets in Punjab, totalling Rs 178 crore.""The cloud sale and lease back model was found non-existent to cheat the investors. The proceeds of crime of Rs 3,558 crore (ascertained so far) generated out of criminal activities were diverted by VMSL (Vuenow Marketing Services Ltd) and group companies in giving commission to channel partners, purchase of various luxurious vehicles, gold and diamonds, routing of hundreds of crores through shell entities and further investment in properties,"" ED said.The accused created multiple shell entities to siphon off proceeds of crime. Huge funds were also diverted into bank accounts of Dimple and to film production units controlled by her, such as Kharour Films LLP, Fruitchaat Entertainment Pvt and Avni ITInfra Ventures Ltd, in which she is a director. However, these companies do not have any relation with the cloud particle business VMSL that collected huge funds from investors, the agency said.ED was on the lookout for the influential couple who had evaded arrest in Punjab for a long time despite several complaints of cheating and fraud. The central agency finally registered an FIR in Noida and with the help of UP Police issued a look out notice. Officials coordinated with international enforcement agencies that helped in tracing the accused in Nepal from where they were sent to India. ""Sukhvinder, CEO and founder of Vuenow Group is 'mastermind' of the scam who in connivance with his close aides orchestrated the 'Cloud Particle Scam',"" ED said.","A court in jalandhar remanded sukhvinder singh kharour to 10 days in ed custody.

The highest court of the UAE, the Court of Cassation, upheld the sentence. The Embassy provided all possible legal assistance to Shahzadi, including sending mercy petitions and pardon requests to the government of the UAE. The UAE authorities intimated to the Embassy on February 28, 2025 that the sentence of Shahzadi has been carried out in accordance with local laws. The family of Shahzadi has been informed of the matter,"" MEA said later in the day.Additional solicitor general (ASG) Chetan Sharma, representing the MEA, informed the Delhi high court about Shahzadi's execution. He also said that the Indian government was providing support to her family, and her cremation is scheduled for March 5.The heartbroken father, Shabbir said that his daughter was not given justice. ""She was not given justice. I tried my best. I have been trying since last year. I don't have enough money to go there (Abu Dhabi) and hire a lawyer. Government did not support us,"" he said.Shabbir Khan had approached the Delhi high court, urging the MEA to intervene in his daughter's case and seek clarity on her legal status. However, with confirmation of her execution, the court disposed of his plea.Shahzadi, a 33-year-old woman from Banda district in Uttar Pradesh, had been working in Abu Dhabi since December 2021 as a caregiver for an Emirati family. The case stemmed from the death of an infant under her care in December 2022, allegedly following routine vaccinations. Initially, the child's parents waived further investigation, but in February 2023, a video surfaced allegedly showing Shahzadi confessing to the murder, a confession her family claimed was obtained through coercion.She was arrested on February 10, 2023, and sentenced to death on July 31, 2023. Her appeals were dismissed, and the death sentence was reaffirmed by the Court of Cassation on February 28, 2024.Shahzadi's family contested the conviction, alleging that she was forced into confessing and denied fair representation. Despite legal assistance provided by the Indian Embassy, her clemency plea faced significant hurdles. Her father, Shabbir Khan, submitted multiple petitions, including one to the Indian Embassy in May 2024, but received no favourable response.On February 14, 2025, Shahzadi reportedly made a distress call to her father, hinting at her imminent execution. Desperate, Shabbir filed an urgent plea with the MEA on February 20, seeking an update on her legal status. However, before any intervention could be secured, the execution was carried out.MEA officials assured that they are extending all necessary assistance to the family, and Shahzadi's last rites are set for March 5. The Indian Embassy has also provided a dedicated contact number for the family to coordinate further arrangements.","Father's plea ends in tragedy for shahzadi khan, convicted of murdering an infant under her care.

Coming to Gir also brings back many memories of the work we collectively did when I was serving as Gujarat CM.

"'Cover blown': Congress's EAGLE team accuses EC of voter list fraud, claims BJP benefiting from duplicate IDs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cover-blown-congresss-eagle-team-accuses-ec-of-voter-list-fraud-claims-bjp-benefiting-from-duplicate-ids/articleshow/118688977.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday accused the Election Commission (EC) of being complicit in large-scale voter list manipulation, alleging that duplicate voter ID numbers have been used to favor the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The allegations were made by the party’s Empowered Action Group of Leaders and Experts (EAGLE), which has called the issue a grave threat to India’s democratic fabric.""The cover is now blown. It is clear that the ruling BJP wins or attempts to win elections by manipulating voter lists in connivance with the Election Commission. Which is why the process of appointment of the Election Commissioners is so critical to the Narendra Modi government that it subverted a Supreme Court ruling to have a balanced committee to appoint Election Commissioners,"" the Congress said in a post on X.The Congress had set up an eight-member team EAGLE last month to keep a “bird’s eye view” of elections in the country and “monitor the conduct of free and fair elections by the Election Commission”. The panel includes Congress leaders Ajay Maken, Digvijaya Singh, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Praveen Chakravarty, Pawan Khera, Gurdeep Singh Sappal, Nitin Raut and Challa Vamshi Chand Reddy.According to the statement by the EAGLE, multiple voters were found registered under the same voter ID number within the same constituency and even across different states. The party called this an unprecedented violation of electoral integrity, comparing it to multiple vehicles being registered under the same license plate number.During the Maharashtra assembly elections held in 2024, the Congress claimed the EC registered an astonishing 40 lakh new voters within just five months—far exceeding the 32 lakh new voter registrations recorded over the entire previous five-year period (2019-2024).“These new voters, suspiciously, seem to have voted overwhelmingly for the BJP-led alliance in Maharashtra, significantly impacting the election results in their favor,” the Congress alleged.The Congress further claimed that when initially confronted with evidence of duplicate voter IDs, the EC dismissed concerns, stating that a voter ID number may be repeated across states but remains unique within a state. However, subsequent findings contradicted this claim, exposing instances of identical voter IDs being used within the same constituency. The party accused the EC of deliberate silence following these revelations.The Congress alleged that the ruling BJP has manipulated the electoral process in collaboration with the EC to secure victories. The party also criticised the Modi government for overriding a Supreme Court directive aimed at ensuring a balanced appointment process for Election Commissioners.“This is a grave danger to India’s democracy,” a statement from the Congress read. “Babasaheb Ambedkar envisioned an independent Election Commission to safeguard elections from executive interference. We will not let this issue fade away and will pursue legal, political, and legislative remedies,” it said.",The congress has accused the election commission of being complicit in large-scale voter list manipulation.
