J&K: Operation Akhal enters Day 3; at least one terrorist killed during encounter with security forces,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-operation-akhal-enters-day-3-at-least-one-terrorist-killed-during-encounter-with-security-forces/articleshow/123071553.cms,"NEW DELHI: At least one terrorist was killed in an encounter after the security forces carried out Operation Akhal in Jammu and Kashmir 's Kulgam district.According to Chinar Corps of the Army, the operation, which started on Friday, continued overnight as troops responded with calibrated fire.""OP AKHAL, Kulgam. Intermittent and intense firefight continued through the night. Alert troops responded with calibrated fire and tightened the noose while maintaining contact,"" Chinar Corps wrote in a social media post on X.""One terrorist has been neutralised by the security forces so far. Operation continues,"" the post added on X.The gunfight broke out on Friday evening in the Akhal Khulsan forest area after joint teams of the Army, J&K Police, and Special Operations Group launched a combing operation, based on intelligence inputs about the presence of three to five terrorists.According to officials, the identity and group affiliation of the slain terrorist are being ascertained. They added that the operation is still underway.Security forces have been carrying out aggressive operations against terrorists in the hinterland, while the Army has been on maximum alert guarding the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir.Three hardcore Pakistani terrorists, including LeT commander Suleman Shah and his two associates Abu Hamza and Jibran, responsible for the Pahalgam attack, were killed on July 28 in the higher reaches of Dachigam National Park at the foot of the Mahadev mountain peak in the Harwan area of Srinagar.The Army code-named this operation Operation Mahadev. After the Pahalgam terror attack, the security forces have been carrying out anti-terrorist operations against gun-wielding terrorists, their overground workers (OGWs), and sympathisers.Drug smugglers and drug peddlers are also on the radar of the security forces, as it is believed that the funds generated by hawala money rackets and drug smuggling are used to sustain terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.The coordinated and information-backed operations of the joint forces are aimed at dismantling the ecosystem of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, rather than focusing solely on the elimination of gun-wielding terrorists.",Security forces carried out operation akhal in jammu and kashmir's kulgam district.

"Malegaon blast case: Judge showed concern over torture methods, detention",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/malegaon-blast-case-judge-showed-concern-over-torture-methods-detention/articleshow/123070485.cms,"MUMBAI: In the 1,036-page judgment in the Malegaon blast case , the judge found merit in allegations that the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) had tortured witnesses and planted evidence. While the court dismissed torture claims from now- acquitted accused Pragya Thakur and Lt Col Prasad Purohit, it did find accused Sameer Kulkarni's claims of illegal detention to be credible.These findings against the agency echo those made by the Bombay high court in the 11/7 train blasts case judgment. The HC in its July 21 judgment discarded the evidence used to imprison 12 men for almost two decades. The HC also expressed serious doubts about the integrity of ATS's investigation methods. It held that confessions of the accused were a result of custodial torture. The court detailed brutal methods allegedly used by police to extract confessions, including, forcing individuals to split their legs 180 degrees, tying people to a chair all night, denying them food for long periods, placing cockroaches in vests and rats in underwear, along with severe beatings.The HC said, ""Not allowing a person to sleep, making him stand the whole night with his arms tied above his head, or stretching his legs to 180 degrees, as has been repeatedly testified to by the accused, will not leave visible scars on the body, no matter how much this may bruise the mind or injure the psyche.""In the Malegaon case, 39 of the 323 who resiled from their statements purportedly given to ATS too made allegations of torture.The NIA judge expressed concern about methods of torture and illegal detention adopted by ATS officers and raised questions about credibility of evidence collected. A witness claimed he was forcibly taken by ATS officers in Nashik and interrogated late into the night. He alleged the officers threatened him and pressured him to give a statement that aligned with their narrative. Feeling sick and fed up with the repeated calls and forceful detentions, he gave a statement as dictated by ATS. He said the facts in that statement are baseless and had filed a complaint against ATS officers with the human rights commission. The judge concluded, ""Thus, the possibility cannot be ruled out that his statement was recorded by browbeating and threatening him to face dire consequences. The testimony of this witness itself shows that his statement was involuntary and forceful. Such a statement cannot be relied upon.""The judgment also called for an inquiry into the actions of ATS officer Shekhar Bagade, whose presence at an accused's house under suspicious circumstances was noted. The accused, Sudhakar Chaturvedi, was acquitted on charges of assembling the bomb. ""Remnants of RDX which were found tilted towards the planting. Two Army officers testified that they had seen... Bagade in the house in suspicious circumstances holding one bag and carrying out some suspicious activities,"" the judge said. Similarly in the train blasts case, HC made observations on the importance of genuine justice. ""But creating a false appearance of having solved a case by presenting that the accused have been brought to justice gives a misleading sense of resolution.""",The court dismissed torture claims from now- acquitted accused pragya thakur and lt col prasad purohit. It did find accused sameer kulkarni's claims of illegal detention to be credible. These findings against the agency echo those made by the bombay high court in the 11/7 train blasts case.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123070526,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1722238,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Poll Should Indian Railways implement stricter access control measures to prevent overcrowding? Yes, it's urgently needed No, current system is enough

NEW DELHI: The stampede at New Delhi Railway Station on Feb 15 that claimed 18 lives was triggered due to a ""big headload falling from one of the passengers"", railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw told Rajya Sabha on Friday, quoting the findings of a high-level inquiry committee.In a written reply to a question from Samajwadi Party MP Ramji Lal Suman about the status of the committee constituted to investigate the stampede, Vaishnaw submitted that the incident happened on foot overbridge (FOB)-3 stairs connecting platforms 14/15 at the station. Sufficient crowd management protocols were in place to handle the overall volume of passengers at the station on that day, he claimed.Also read: Toll rises to 9 in Mansa Devi stampede; 2 still critical ""There was a gradual increase of passenger density on the FOB after 20.15 hrs. Many of the passengers were carrying big headloads, affecting smooth movement on the FOB.

This led to an incident at 20.48 hrs on FOB-3, which was limited to the stairs of FOB. Consequently, passengers fell on each other. In the incident, 18 people lost their lives and 15 others were injured,"" Vaishnaw said in the written reply.Indian Railways has paid Rs 2 crore as ex gratia to 33 victims and their family members-Rs 10 lakh to the next of kin of each deceased, Rs 2.5 lakh each to the grievously injured, and Rs one lakh each to those with simple injuries.Also read: How New Delhi railway station stampede unfolded On the corrective steps being taken, the ministry said a series of measures had been planned to handle heavy rush at stations, including creation of permanent holding areas at 73 identified stations, such as New Delhi, Anand Vihar, Ghaziabad, Varanasi, Ayodhya and Surat, which periodically face heavy crowds.There is a plan to have complete access control, meaning only passengers with confirmed reserved tickets will be given direct access to the platforms and other passengers will wait in the outside waiting area.

NEW DELHI: Suspended JD(S) leader and former MP Prajwal Revanna was sentenced to life imprisonment by a special court in Bengaluru on Saturday in connection with a rape case involving a 47-year-old woman. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 10 lakh on the 34-year-old, as reported by news agency PTI.Revanna, the grandson of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda , broke down in court during the sentencing hearing, claiming he had done “nothing wrong” and pleading for leniency. “The only mistake I made in my life is growing fast in politics,” he told the court, as reported by PTI.Also read: Prajwal Revanna gets life imprisonment for raping 47-year-old domestic worker The suspended JD(S) MP further said, “I have a family, I have not seen my mother and father for six months now… please give me a less sentence is what I request the court.”The case pertains to a domestic help who was allegedly raped by Revanna twice—in 2021 at the family’s Gannikada farmhouse in Holenarasipura and later at a residence in Bengaluru. The accused had allegedly recorded the act on his mobile phone.Ahead of sentencing, Revanna, claimed the charges against him were politically motivated. “They say that I have raped multiple women, but none of the women have come out voluntarily to complain, they came six days prior to election (Lok Sabha polls last year)...the prosecution side brought them purposefully and made them give a complaint,” he told the court, as quoted by PTI.Also read: Prajwal Revanna conviction, a sex scandal that shook Karnataka Revanna also questioned the timing of the complaint, pointing out that the victim had not reported the alleged crime to her husband or relatives until explicit videos began circulating. “She comes and gives complaint when certain videos were circulated,” he said.The Special Investigation Team (SIT), which had been tasked with probing the multiple cases against Revanna, filed a 1,632-page chargesheet in September 2024, featuring 113 witnesses. He was booked under several IPC sections including 376(2)(k), 376(2)(n), 354A, 354B, 354C, 506, and 201, as well as Section 66E of the IT Act.According to Special Public Prosecutor Ashok Nayak, the prosecution relied on digital evidence, including videos recorded by the accused, DNA reports, and material recovered years after the alleged incidents. “The clothes worn by the victim during the rape were also identified and seized after three-four years,” he said, crediting the Investigation Officer for preserving critical forensic evidence.Revanna was arrested on May 31 last year after landing in Bengaluru from Germany. The allegations first came to light in April 2024, just ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, when pen drives containing explicit videos allegedly featuring him were circulated in Hassan. He later failed to retain his Hassan constituency seat in the polls.

Malegaon case

What happened in 2008

NEW DELHI: Sadhvi Pragya, recently acquitted of terror charges in the Malegaon blast case , claimed on Saturday that she was ""tortured and forced to name Prime Minister Narendra Modi, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, and others"".The former Bhopal MP said she did not name them, as it was ""a clear attempt to coerce her into lying"".“They made me name several people, including Ram Madhav. To do all of this, they tortured me. My lungs gave up... I was detained in a hospital illegally. All of this will shared in the story I am writing, but the truth cannot be buried. I lived in Gujarat, so they also asked me name Prime Minister Modi (who was then Gujarat chief minister). I did not take anyone's name because they were trying to make me lie,"" she said.She further claimed that the other names she was pressured to mention included Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Mohan Bhagwat, and senior Sangh functionary Indresh Kumar.""They said take these names and we won't beat you,"" she alleged.After nearly 17 years, a special NIA court in Mumbai on July 31 acquitted all seven accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast case, including former BJP MP Pragya Singh Thakur and Lt Col Prasad Purohit.All were already out on bail.The blast, which struck Malegaon town in Nashik district on September 29, 2008, killed six people and injured over 100. The court ordered compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the families of the deceased and Rs 50,000 to each injured victim.In its verdict, the court noted that the chassis number of the motorcycle allegedly used in the blast had been wiped out. It also ruled that there was no reliable evidence proving that Thakur owned the vehicle. The court further observed that she had taken sanyas (renunciation) two years prior to the incident and had given up material possessions.An explosive device, allegedly strapped to a motorcycle, detonated near a mosque during the holy month of Ramzan and on the eve of Navratri festivities. Among the other accused acquitted are Major Ramesh Upadhyay (Retd), Ajay Rahirkar, Sameer Kulkarni, Sudhakar Chaturvedi, and Sudhakar Dhar Dwivedi.The ATS had alleged that the motorcycle used in the blast belonged to Thakur, while Purohit brought the RDX from Jammu and Kashmir and stored it in his house. Both denied the allegations. They were acquitted from charges under various stringent sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including committing a terrorist act, conspiring to commit a terrorist act, criminal conspiracy, murder, and promoting enmity between religious groups.The investigation, initially led by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) under the late Hemant Karkare, quickly led to the arrest of Thakur and now Purohit in late 2008. The ATS, at the time, alleged, for the first time, the involvement of ""saffron extremists"" and linked the accused to a larger conspiracy, including other blast cases.Investigations into the alleged larger conspiracy of the Abhinav Bharat organization allegedly brought to light a series of crucial meetings, painting a picture of a group purportedly intent on avenging perceived atrocities against Hindus and establishing a ""Central Hindu Government"" (Aryawart). The prosecution contended that these gatherings demonstrate a calculated effort to strike terror by orchestrating a bomb blast in Malegaon, a Muslim-dominated area.The case took a significant turn when it was transferred to the NIA in 2011. In 2015, special public prosecutor Rohini Salian publicly alleged that the NIA had instructed her to ""go soft"" on the accused, leading to a change in prosecution. The NIA's supplementary chargesheet in May 2016, accusing the ATS of planting RDX traces to frame Purohit and, notably, giving a clean chit to Thakur and others, citing insufficient evidence.Despite the NIA's stance, the special court on December 27, 2017, ruled that seven accused, including Thakur and Purohit, would face trial under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), though charges under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) were dropped. Finally, on October 30, 2018, terror and murder charges were formally framed against Thakur, Purohit, and five others.

'I Was Forced To Name PM Modi': Sadhvi Pragya's EXPLOSIVE Claim In Malegaon Blast Case

EW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde on Saturday strongly defended former BJP MP Pragya Thakur after her controversial claim that she was tortured during the Malegaon blast probe, and accused the Congress-led UPA government of using the incident to frame prominent Hindutva leaders.S peaking in Thane, Shinde said: “Even in the blasts that happened before the Malegaon bomb blast, it was said that this is ‘saffron terrorism’. The then Congress and the UPA government gave it this form. This is an insult to Hindus... A retired police officer had said that RSS leader Mohan Bhagwat should also be implicated in this case... An attempt was made to implicate the prominent leaders of Hindutva in this case.”Shinde also backed Thakur’s recent allegations that investigators pressured her to take Prime Minister Narendra Modi's name. “Sadhvi Pragya said that she was tortured to take PM Modi's name in this case... How can anyone do such a disgusting act for votes and politics?” he asked, before launching a sharp attack on Rahul Gandhi “Rahul Gandhi always speaks the language of Pakistan. He is famous in Pakistan... Is this patriotism? This is love for Pakistan.The politicians who pressured those conducting the investigation should be investigated, their narco tests should be performed, and strict action should be taken against them,” Shinde said.Thakur, who was acquitted this week in the 2008 Malegaon blasts case along with six others, had earlier told reporters that officers tried to force her to name top BJP and RSS leaders including PM Modi and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. She alleged illegal detention and torture, although the court found no evidence to support these claims. “I did not take anyone’s name because I didn’t want to lie,” Thakur said, adding that she is writing her story to reveal the full truth.The special NIA court ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.

NEW DELHI: With countries gearing up for a crucial meeting of the UN's International Negotiating Committee (INC) in Geneva from Aug 5-14 to finalise a legally binding global treaty to end plastic pollution, India will pitch for ""consensus-based decision making"" to reach an agreement that should focus on aspects related to ""plastic pollution only"" without affecting right to sustainable development of developing countries.""Aspects which are not directly related to plastic pollution should not be taken up. We need to strike a critical balance between preventing plastic pollution without affecting the right to sustainable development of developing countries and keeping in view their respective national circumstances,"" Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav told TOI recently in an interview.Specifically asked about an obstacle before developing an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution and India's stand in this context, Yadav said the country believes that the success of negotiations at INC require consensus-based decision making with the spirit of mutual trust and cooperation for reaching an agreement on various provisions.He further said, ""As developed countries have higher per capita generation of plastic waste and have historical responsibility, they need to provide financial and technical assistance by setting up a standalone multilateral fund which provides incremental cost for transition to developing countries for meeting compliance obligations.""The treaty is vital as currently more than 460 million metric tonne of plastic is produced globally every year, of which an estimated 20 million tonne ends up polluting the environment by affecting land, freshwater and marine habitats.
