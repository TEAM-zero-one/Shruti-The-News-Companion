'We will have to do something now': Supreme Court moves on passive euthanasia plea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-will-have-to-do-something-now-supreme-court-moves-on-passive-euthanasia-plea/articleshow/125923481.cms,"Supreme Court

We can't allow 31-yr-old to live like this, that's for sure, says SC

NEW DELHI: The choice is between an artificially sustained painful life and peaceful death. As a medical board of four specialised doctors told Supreme Court about the condition of 31-year-old Harish Rana who has been living with 100% disability in a permanent vegetative state for 13 years and stressed the negligible chance of his recovery, the court Thursday decided to set in motion the next stage of the process for passive euthanasia A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan asked the director of AIIMS Delhi to set up a secondary medical board, the second step as per the procedure laid down by the apex court in 2018, and simplified in 2023, on euthanasia pleas. The plea was filed by Harish's father, Ashok Rana.Going through the report of the primary medical board set up by Noida District Hospital, the bench noted there was no hope of recovery. ""The bare reading of the letter would indicate Harish is in a pathetic condition. He was found to be lying on a bed with tracheostomy tube for respiration and gastrostomy for feeding. The photographs attached with the letter would indicate he has suffered huge bed sores. The team of doctors are of the opinion that the chance of his recovery from the present state is negligible. Harish appears to be in this vegetative condition for the past 13 years.In such circumstances...we should now proceed to the next stage in the process,"" the bench said.As per the apex court's guidelines, a secondary medical board comprising one registered medical practitioner nominated by the chief medical officer (CMO) of the district and at least two subject experts with at least five years' experience in the specialty concerned has to be constituted after a primary medical board approves withdrawing artificial life support for a patient in a vegetative state. Though advocate Rashmi Nandakumar, appearing for the petitioner, said that there was no need for a secondary board as the CMO was involved in the primary medical board itself, the bench decided to adhere to the procedure.It said this would be in accordance with the decision of the SC in the 'common cause' case. ""We request the director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi to constitute a secondary board, as referred to above, and give us a report by next Wednesday, ie Dec 17. Let the matter come up for hearing on Thursday,"" the bench said.At the end of the hearing, the court remarked, ""We will have to do something now. We can't allow him to live like this. That's for sure.""Harish's case will be the first to see a court monitor the process on a euthanasia plea since SC framed guidelines and the procedure to allow it. In 2018, the court legalised passive euthanasia by allowing withdrawal of life support for terminally ill patients and ruled that the ""right to die with dignity"" is a part of the fundamental right to life.The court subsequently modified its order in 2023 to simplify the process and put in place two-tier medical board to take the call on a plea for passive euthanasia and also allowed the kin of the patient to move the high court concerned in case of denial of the same.Harish had fallen from the fourth floor of his paying guest accommodation on Aug 20, 2013, while he was pursuing a B Tech degree at Punjab University. He was treated at various hospitals, but his condition did not improve. His father had first moved Delhi HC, which refused his plea to refer the case to a primary medical board.Challenging the HC order, the father said Harish's existence in his current state is a violation of his fundamental right to dignity, and the HC had erred in not adhering to apex court guidelines.","Harish rana, 31, has been living with 100% disability in a permanent vegetative state for 13 years. The court thursday decided to set in motion the next stage of the process for passive euthanasia.

NEW DELHI: Top representatives of airlines, aviation ministry and regulator DGCA will appear on Dec 17 before a parliamentary committee, which is set to question them on the days long ordeal faced by thousands of fliers due to mass-cancellation of flights by IndiGo due to its unpreparedness after a new rule for more rest for pilots kicked in.The meeting of standing committee on transport, tourism & culture headed by JDU MP Sanjay Jha is expected to pose tough questions to not only IndiGo, India's largest airline that commands 63% market share, over the fiasco but also DGCA over its inability to anticipate the crisis that derailed travel plans of people, including Parliamentarians.The committee's deliberations will happen against the backdrop of the widely held suspicion, subject of investigation by directorate general of civil aviation and the ministry, that IndiGo remained resistant to the implementation of guidelines which are consistent with global norms and are aimed at ensuring flyers' safety by allowing pilots enough resting time, and sought the determent of their implementation. It has been acccused of engineering the disruption to force, leveraging its market dominance, the ministry to roll back the Flight Duty Time Limitation regulation as implementing them would have required it to hire more pilots.

Why will we run away from own country: Sunali

NEW DELHI: More than nine months pregnant now, and visibly exhausted, Sunali Khatun's voice carried a strange mix of tired resolve and simmering anger when she spoke to TOI on Thursday. ""I'm tired from inside. The worst part is that despite showing all documents, no one listened to us,"" she said, fighting back tears.The 26-year-old domestic worker from Paikar village in West Bengal's Birbhum district was detained during an identity verification drive in Delhi's Rohini in late June this year. Sunali said she and her husband, Danish Sekh, immediately produced every document they had - Aadhaar, PAN and ration card. ""I even quickly presented my in-laws' ID proofs arranged over WhatsApp the same night."" Nothing worked.We did everything in our power,"" Sunali said. ""We showed every single document. We kept telling them, 'We are not Bangladeshi. We are Indian.' Who will listen to people like us?""Within 48 hours, on June 26, after the Foreigners Regional Registration Office deportation order, police seized the couple's belongings from their Rohini jhuggi and took them and their eight-year-old son, Sabir Sekh, to Guwahati.From there, she said, they were pushed across the Bangladesh border in hot haste.The deportation was sudden and unexpected for the couple and their families back in West Bengal. For the next five months, Sunali was trapped in a maze of suspicion. What followed, she says, ""broke something inside her.""After filing a missing-person complaint at his local Palkar police station on 6 July 2025, Sunali's father, Bhodu Sekh, moved the Calcutta HC three days later. On 9 July 2025, his habeas corpus petition seeking production of his daughter, son-in-law and grandson was registered.With no information from authorities & fearing his heavily pregnant daughter might be left to deliver without medical help in an unknown country, Bhodu filed pleading for urgent intervention. In his petition, he, too, said family had supplied Aadhaar, voter IDs, PAN cards and land records to show their Indian roots, yet authorities deported them.Back in Bangladesh, the time there for Sunali and her family were a blur of hunger, fear and humiliation. ""We remained in hell. We didn't even have Rs 5 to feed our children,"" she said. ""We had a single set of clothes, my yellow kurta and blue salwar. My son his red T-shirt and black half-pants. For food & shelter, there was the mercy of strangers.""When they initially attempted to return a few days after entering Bangladesh, she says the Indian side beat them brutally despite their pleas. ""We were profiled simply because we were Bengali-speaking Muslims.""When produced before a Bangladeshi court, Sunali says she expected questions about who they were, how they crossed, why they were there. But it was over in minutes. ""They didn't ask us anything, just put us in jail,"" she said. ""Humne sirf bola hum Bharat ke hain. Documents hote hue koi kyun bhejega? Wo log bhi hairaan thhe. (We only said in court there that we are from India. Why will we run away from our own country when we possess valid papers. They, too, were surprised)."" Sunali described the months in the jail as ""mental torture"".Though she is home for now, Sunali says her heart is heavy with fear & foreboding. ""Are there any other documents we can get? What if we are shoved out again? I can't sleep thinking about that.""","Sunali khatun was detained during an identity verification drive in delhi's rohini in late june this year.

NEW DELHI: Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of ‘Birch by Romeo Lane’ nightclub in Goa, were detained by Thai Police early on Thursday on the request of Indian law enforcement agencies, sources said. The duo was wanted after fleeing the country following last week’s blaze that claimed 25 lives. They were detained from a resort in Phuket.They had fled to Phuket, Thailand. The Thailand Police on Thursday released pictures showing the brothers in their custody. They will be deported and handed over to the Indian authorities. A team has already reached there, sources said.Goa Police had requested the Interpol through MEA and CBI for their apprehension. A blue corner notice was subsequently issued against them by the Interpol.A blue notice is typically issued to gather additional information about a person’s identity, whereabouts or activities in connection with a criminal investigation.Goa Police said it would help trace the accused and also prevent them from migrating to any other country from their present destination. A senior Goa police officer said while a blue corner notice typically takes about a week to process, in this case, it was issued within two days of the incident with the support of central agencies.India and Thailand signed a formal extradition treaty in 2013, which came into force on June 29, 2015. Goa CM Pramod Sawant told TOI a team will be sent to Thailand to bring back the accused.The regional passport office, New Delhi, has, meanwhile, issued a notice to the brothers seeking an explanation from both as to why action should not be initiated to impound their passports within seven days.On Sunday, a Goa Police team had reached Delhi with an arrest warrant for the Luthra brothers and searched their residential and office premises, but they were not found. “Since they were unavailable, a notice under the appropriate sections of law was pasted at their residence. By the evening of Dec 7, a lookout circular was issued against both by the Bureau of Immigration at the request of Goa Police,” a Goa Police officer said.The Bureau of Immigration in Mumbai later informed investigators that the brothers boarded IndiGo flight 6E 1073 to Phuket at 5.30am Sunday, just hours after the blaze.A lookout notice was also issued against the owner of the property, UK national Surinder Kumar Khosla, and the Luthras’ partner, Ajay Gupta.The blaze broke out around 11.45pm Saturday during an event attended by more than 150 tourists. A preliminary investigation by Goa Police and Directorate of Fire Services found it was triggered when electric firecrackers struck the wooden ceiling. As flames coursed through the roof, the guests and performers bolted. While most of them were able to step out of the club, many were trapped in the basement after the exit caught fire.","Saurabh and gaurav luthra, co-owners of ‘birch by romeo lane’ nightclub in goa, were detained by thai police early on thursday on the request of indian law enforcement agencies.

This included those who had crossed the age of 65 and beneficiaries under the Sanjay Gandhi Niradhar Yojana, which also provides a monthly stipend of Rs 1,500.

Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

GOA: In the aftermath of the devastating December 6 fire at the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, North Goa, which claimed 25 lives, the North Goa district administration on Thursday banned fireworks inside nightclubs, hotels, and other tourist establishments.BJP’s coalition partner in the government, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), on Wednesday called for the closure of all nightclubs in the state to promote “good tourism.” Since 2014, the MGP has opposed pubs, public bikini swimming, massage parlours, and illegal casinos. The party is Goa’s oldest regional political outfit.“Nightclubs do not sync with Goa’s culture. It is the worst culture. Nightclubs should be stopped,” MGP president Deepak ‘Pandurang’ Dhavalikar said.Dhavalikar said that it is his personal opinion and the same would be discussed at the MGP meeting.The culture of pubs, swimming in bikinis on beaches, massage parlours, and illegal casinos is against ‘Bharatiya saunskruti’ (Indian culture) and should be banned, then PWD minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin Dhavalikar had said in 2014.On Wednesday, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant had convened a high-level meeting with senior officials and key tourism stakeholders to reinforce safety measures ahead of the upcoming Christmas and New Year season.During the meeting, the government issued strict directives to prevent any repeat of the tragedy.Licences of tourist establishments in Goa that lacked fire safety compliance were set to be cancelled. The government also prohibited the sale of liquor after 11 pm across the state to curb late-night violations. Tourists were advised to avoid swimming in danger zones, particularly along beaches identified as high-risk by lifeguard agencies. While the tourism season was to continue as planned, it was to operate under heightened monitoring and stricter compliance checks.Six people had been arrested in connection with the Arpora nightclub fire as authorities intensified their crackdown on illegal operations and safety lapses.Officials said the government would conduct surprise inspections of nightclubs, shacks, and high-footfall venues while reviewing all licences and safety certifications to ensure full compliance.The meeting was held against the backdrop of the December 6 fire at the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, North Goa, which claimed 25 lives, according to sources.“The chief minister briefed those present at the meeting about various measures taken to ensure such a tragedy did not recur in the state,” a senior officer privy to the meeting said.He added that the state government had issued multiple orders and formed committees, including a high-level magisterial inquiry panel and a fire safety audit committee, after the incident.“The chief minister ordered all departments to ensure there was no laxity, especially considering Goa would be seeing a large number of tourists during the Christmas and New Year festivities,” the officer said.(With agency inputs)","Bjp’s coalition partner in the government, the maharashtrawadi gomantak party (mgp), on wednesday called for the closure of all nightclubs in the state.

NEW DELHI: Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra co‑owners of the Goa nightclub Birch by Romeo Lane, have been detained by Thai authorities in Phuket and are set to be deported to India to face investigation in connection with a deadly fire that killed 25 people last week.Indian law enforcement agencies, working through diplomatic and international policing channels, coordinated the operation after the brothers left India shortly after the blaze. A police team has already reached Thailand as the deportation process is underway.The tragedy occurred late on December 6 at the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, North Goa, where a fire erupted amid a crowded event, killing 25 people, including five tourists and twenty staff. A magisterial inquiry has been ordered to determine the cause and responsibilities in the incident.Within hours of the fire, the Luthra brothers were reported to have booked and boarded an IndiGo flight to Phuket, with ticket records showing they left at about 5:30 am on December 7 - while rescue efforts were still underway.Goa Police quickly expanded the probe beyond India’s borders, issuing a lookout circular and securing an Interpol blue corner notice on December 9 to locate the duo.The ministry of external affairs (MEA) responded by suspending the Luthras’ passports on December 11, preventing further travel, and alerting Thai authorities.On December 10 brothers moved to Delhi’s Rohini court seeking four weeks of transit anticipatory bail, claiming they are willing to return to India and cooperate with the investigation into the nightclub blaze.Despite their initial plea seeking bail and claiming they had travelled to Thailand “for work,” the court declined interim relief on December 11.Police refuting the claims made by brothers told the court the brothers booked their tickets after the fire broke out and left on December 7, contrary to their assertion that they were on a business trip and had left on December 6, an action officials described as “incriminating.”Thai immigration authorities nabbed the brothers on December 11 and released pictures of brothers handcuffed at a resort in Phuket, taken into custody on the basis of requests from Indian agencies. Authorities in Thailand are now processing their deportation back to India under existing legal frameworks. India and Thailand have an extradition treaty, and the offense of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, among other charges they face, meets the criteria for surrender under the treaty terms.The investigation in India has also led to the arrest of six others connected to the nightclub’s operations. Among them is Ajay Gupta, described as an operational partner.Goa Police traced him to a private hospital in Delhi after he reportedly sought to avoid arrest by faking illness; he was subsequently taken into custody.With the Luthra brothers detained and deportation underway, Indian authorities are expected to formally take them into custody on return and proceed with the legal process. The broader inquiry continues into fire safety compliance at the club and potential lapses by operators and regulators.","Goa club owners saurabh & gaurav luthra arrested in phuket after deadly fire. 25 people, including five tourists and twenty staff, died in the blaze.

Goa Club Owners Saurabh & Gaurav Luthra Arrested in Phuket After Deadly Fire

NEW DELHI: Delhi court on Thursday denied transit anticipatory bail plea of Saurabh and Gaurav Luthras, owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Goa where a massive fire last week killed at least 25 people.The brothers sought four weeks of transit anticipatory bail on Wednesday, seeking protection from immediate arrest after their return to Delhi from Thailand. The brothers were detained by Thai police early on Thursday at the request of Indian law enforcement agencies. According to officials, their deportation from Thailand has also been initiated.Additional Sessions Judge Vandana reserved the order till 5 pm after hearing the arguments of the advocates who appeared for the Luthras.One of the counsels for the applicants argued that they were willing to return immediately and face the investigation, and urged the court not to “punish them at the threshold”.He said the brothers had approached the Delhi court at the earliest opportunity and undertook to join the probe without delay. “If I land in India tonight and the investigating officer (IO) tells me to appear at midnight, I will be there,” he said.The counsel said that transit bail was not a determination on merits but a limited protection to ensure safe access to the right court.Also Read: Goa nightclub fire: Luthra brothers misled police - what cops told court He cited a Supreme Court order permitting an accused abroad, against whom Blue and Red Corner notices were contemplated, to return to India with temporary protection. “I only seek protection for a few days to reach the court safely.

He said the law does not aid those who refuse to submit to summons or warrants.Referring to judicial observations, the counsel said, ""Once it is shown that a person is attempting to evade the process of law, the court should not come to his aid at all.”He added that anticipatory bail is a discretionary relief and cannot be granted to those who have “created obstacles in the execution of warrants or concealed themselves”","Saurabh and gaurav luthras, owners of the birch by romeo lane nightclub in goa where a massive fire last week killed at least 25 people.

Rahul Gandhi's 'Open Challenge' To Amit Shah In Lok Sabha Over SIR Gets 'I Will Decide' Reply

Amit Shah vs Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Thursday repeated his claim that Amit Shah appeared ‘nervous’ and used ‘foul language’ during the Union home minister's Lok Sabha speech the previous day.“He (Shah) used foul language. His hands were trembling. Mentally, he is under pressure, and it was seen in Parliament. Whatever I had asked, he gave no replies and provided no proof. I challenged him openly to discuss over my press conferences, but nothing happened. Everyone now understands the reality,” Gandhi told reporters.Hitting back, BJP MP Jagdambika Pal asked why Gandhi and the opposition INDIA bloc ""ran away"" when the home minister was speaking.""Then why did he leave? People who flee, abandoning the field, the country watches them. During the two-day discussion, he (Shah) held a mirror against all the questions raised on electoral reforms and SIR... When people went to the Supreme Court against SIR, the Supreme Court also said there is no reason to stop SIR... So how long will they keep blaming the Election Commission, voter list, EVM for their defeat?"" Pal said.During his address on electoral reforms, Shah clashed with Gandhi over the Congress leader’s repeated claims of vote chori’ (theft)” by the Election Commission and the ruling BJP.The Lok Sabha leader of opposition, who has held three press conferences on the issue, challenged the home minister to a debate based on those briefings. In response, Shah remarked that the “House will not function according to his (Gandhi’s) wishes.”The heated exchange erupted when Gandhi interjected during Shah’s address in the Lok Sabha on electoral reforms. Criticising the opposition over the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, the senior BJP leader argued that he had responses to all their accusations, including those raised in Gandhi’s three press conferences.“In his press conference, the LoP claimed the voter list is flawed and needs correction. That is exactly what SIR is — a process to clean up the rolls. Yet he opposes it. Your defeat is certain; the voter list has nothing to do with it. Double standards won’t work in a democracy. When you win, the EC is great; when you lose, the EC is biased. I have answers to all these allegations — those three press conferences included,” Shah remarked.Gandhi then interrupted and challenged him to a debate. “Yesterday, I asked why Election Commissioners were given full immunity. We want to understand the reasoning behind it. He (Amit Shah) mentioned Haryana, but there are many other examples — including 19 lakh fake voters. Let’s debate my press conferences. Amit Shah ji, I challenge you to a debate on all three,” the Rae Bareli MP asserted.Shah responded that Gandhi could not dictate the order of his speech and should remain patient. “You cannot run Parliament through obstinacy. I will decide the order of my address. The House won’t function like this. He should be patient. I will respond to every point,” he countered.Opposition MPs walked out of the Lok Sabha during Shah’s reply to the discussion on electoral reforms.","The heated exchange erupted when gandhi interjected during shah’s address in the lok sabha on electoral reforms.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Thursday issued a revised Special Intensive Revision (SIR) schedule for Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, MP, Chhattisgarh, UP and Andaman and Nicobar Islands following requests from CEOs.In the earlier revised schedule, the Enumeration Period for these 6 States/UT was till December 11 and the earlier date of publication of the draft Electoral Rolls was December 16.Earlier, the stretching of all legs of SIR came amid reports of alleged malpractices in states. Instances include submission of enumeration forms by ineligible persons or illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in the name of dead electors, and login credentials of dead BLOs being misused to upload EFs signed in the name of dead electors.The extension of the timeline excludes West Bengal, where the deadline for the submission and digitisation of the enumeration forms in the ongoing SIR will come to an end at 12 midnight on Thursday.As of Wednesday night, a total of 57,52,207 voters have been identified by the ECI as excludable voters in West Bengal. Out of them, 24,14,750 are deceased voters, followed by 19,89,914 shifted voters and 11,57,889 untraceable voters.The rest are duplicate voters and voters deemed to be found excludable for other reasons.Also Read: House-to-house, form-to-form: The unseen daily grind of BLOs amid SIR rollout The total number of voters as per the list as of October 27, 2025, is 7,66,37,529.

What the Luthras claim

NEW DELHI: Goa Police on Thursday told the court that Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, wanted in the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub fire that killed 25 people - had “misled” investigators and shown “no cooperation” during the probe, according to statements made in court.Gaurav Luthra and Saurabh Luthra, co-owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Goa, had moved Delhi’s Rohini court seeking anticipatory bail, and the hearing continued for the second day.Opposing their anticipatory bail pleas, police said the brothers left for Phuket shortly after the December 6 blaze and inaccurately claimed they had departed India earlier than records show.“There is no cooperation on the part of Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, which disentitled them for extraordinary protection by this court. They have no business in Thailand. They left the country on December 7. Though, they said that they had left on the night of December 6. Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra misled the court, misled the authorities and left the country,” police submitted, as per ANI.Investigators told the court that both brothers, along with partner Ajay Gupta, were signatories of the club’s operations. They added that the Panchayat licence for the venue had lapsed and had not been renewed at the time of the incident.The blaze broke out during a musical night attended by nearly 100 people. Videos from minutes before the incident showed performers dancing as electric firecrackers were set off, a likely trigger. The club’s extensive flammable decor, lack of functional fire-safety equipment and a narrow access road that left fire engines stranded about 400 metres away worsened the situation.Twenty-five people, five tourists and 20 staff members, died, most from inhaling toxic smoke while trapped in the basement.Four staffers were arrested soon after the incident, while the Luthra brothers left for Thailand hours after booking their tickets as the fire was still being extinguished. Their partner Ajay Gupta was arrested in Delhi and later moved to Goa for questioning. Both Saurabh and Gaurav have since been detained in Thailand and are expected to be deported.In their bail petition, the brothers argue they are licensees, not owners, of the building, and insist they travelled to Thailand for a business meeting rather than to evade investigators. They have sought four weeks’ transit anticipatory bail to avoid immediate arrest upon arrival.The court will continue hearing their pleas as the investigation into one of Goa’s deadliest nightclub fires proceeds.","Saurabh and gaurav luthra, co-owners of the birch by romeo lane nightclub in goa, had moved delhi’s rohini court seeking anticipatory bail.

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janta Party MP Anurag Thakur on Thursday asked the Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla whether he had allowed e-cigarettes inside the House, accusing the Trinamool Congress MPs of ""continuously vaping"" in the Parliament.“I just want to request something so that the House knows.

NEW DELHI: A local court on Thursday sentenced one person to death and awarded life imprisonment to nine others for the murder committed during communal violence last year in Maharajganj town during a Durga idol immersion procession.The violence took place on October 13 last year, when 21-year-old Ramgopal Mishra was shot dead as a communal clash erupted in the mixed-population area of Maharajganj. The incident triggered widespread tension in Mahsi, Maharajganj and parts of Bahraich city. Large-scale vandalism and arson were reported the next day, prompting an extensive police response.Home Secretary Sanjeev Gupta and STF Chief and ADG (Law & Order) Amitabh Yash were rushed to restore order, while internet services were suspended and heavy deployment of PAC, RRF, STF and police forces from neighbouring districts was made.Thirteen people had been named as accused in the FIR.

22 Feared Dead As Truck Falls Into Gorge In Arunachal Pradesh

GUWAHATI: At least 22 labourers from Assam are feared dead after a mini truck fell into a deep gorge in Arunachal Pradesh’s Anjaw district near the Indo‑China border. The accident occurred on Monday night along the high‑altitude Hayuliang–Chaglagam road.The incident came to light only on Thursday night when a lone survivor, severely injured, managed to climb out of the gorge and walk about 4 km to reach a Border Roads Organisation camp. He alerted officials to the mishap.Anjaw district deputy commissioner Millo Kojin told TOI that an Army team reached the wreckage but could not retrieve any bodies due to the treacherous terrain.“The NDRF team from Assam is reaching the site with specialised equipment tonight, and search and rescue operations are expected to begin tomorrow. The injured survivor has been shifted to Assam Medical College and Hospital in Dibrugarh,” he said.He added that details of 18 individuals are known so far and efforts are on to collect the information of the other four.Defence PRO Lt Col M Rawat said that Indian Army launches search and rescue operation in higher reaches of Arunachal Pradesh.He said that after four hours of intensive search and rope descent on Thursday, the truck was spotted around 200 metres below the road near KM 40 in a re-entrant, inaccessible and not visible from helicopters or the road due to dense tree cover and thick foliage and 18 bodies have been spotted so far.“The accident site, approximately 12 km short of Chaglagam, lies in difficult terrain with limited connectivity and had not been reported by any local agency, contractor or civil representative until the survivor’s arrival,” the PRO said.","A mini truck fell into a deep gorge in arunachal pradesh’s anjaw district.

Amit Shah gives point-by-point rebuttal on 'vote chori' charge

NEW DELHI: The debate on the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in the Lok Sabha turned heated on Wednesday as leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi challenged home minister Amit Shah to an open debate, prompting a firm response from the minister: ""I will decide.""As Shah countered the opposition’s allegations of 'vote chori' and referred to Rahul Gandhi’s charge of ""multiple voters at one Haryana house,"" the Congress leader stood up, interrupting the speech.""My question yesterday was that for the first time in history, full immunity was given to the election commissioner. I wanted to know the reasoning behind this decision. Secondly, about Haryana, he [Amit Shah] took one example of fake voters, but there are 19 lakh fake voters,” Rahul said.""You tell us ... actually, let us have a debate on my press conference, very good idea, let us go, let us have a debate,"" he added.""Amit Shah ji, I challenge you, I challenge you to have a debate,"" Rahul declared in the House.Amid uproar, Shah responded, ""Speaker sir, I want to clarify first, I have been elected as an MLA or MP for the last 30 years. I have a long experience of the procedures.""Looking directly at Rahul Gandhi, he said in a stern manner, ""Parliament will not proceed according to your wishes.I will decide the sequence of my speech. The Parliament will not work like this.""""Speaker sir, he should have some patience to listen to my answer. I will reply to each and everything. But he will not decide the sequence of my speech, I will decide it,"" Shah reiterated.""This is a completely defensive response, a scared response,"" Rahul retorted.Resuming his address with a noticeably calm tone, Shah told Speaker Om Birla, ""I can see worry lines on your face. Do not worry, I will not be provoked by them. I will continue with my reply.""Shah then went on to address the 'vote chori' accusations, stating that such issues occurred during the tenures of Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. He also referenced a case in the Delhi high court, alleging that Sonia Gandhi became a voter before becoming Indian.Amit Shah offered a point-by-point rebuttal over the allegation of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over vote theft in the Lok Sabha.During the ongoing debate on electoral reforms in the Parliament, Shah took a jibe at the Congress leader's ""nuclear bomb"" press conference said that his press conferences are not ""Constitutional provisions.""""Opposition Leader Rahul Gandhi dropped a “nuclear bomb” in a press conference on 5 November 2025. In that ‘nuclear bomb’, he claimed that 501 votes had been cast from a single house in Haryana. The Election Commission has clarified that House Number 265 is no small dwelling, but rather a joint residence for multiple families built on a one-acre ancestral plot,"" the home minister said.""However, separate house numbers have not been assigned to each family, so their house number is simply listed as 265. And in one of those families, three generations are living together. This numbering has been in place since the Congress government was elected in Haryana. It is neither a fake house nor fake votes,"" he added.Shah also said that it is unfair to blame the people who appear twice in the voter list.""Congress has claimed that some individuals are registered in two different locations on the electoral roll. It is unfair to blame the people who appear twice, as this is often a result of systemic issues. Since 2010, the Returning Officer's authority to remove duplicate entries has been revoked, which has led to such discrepancies. In fact, there are several leaders whose names are registered in more than one place. These are common mistakes caused by the updated rules,"" Shah said.","Rahul gandhi's 'open challenge' to amit shah in lok sabha over sir gets 'i will decide' reply.

Duo purchased flight tickets on Dec 7, lookout circular issued within 24 hrs

Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of 'Birch by Romeo Lane' nightclub in Goa, were detained by Thai police early on Thursday on the request of Indian law enforcement agencies. As their passports were suspended, they became persona non grata in Thailand, prompting the local police to take them into custody, sources said.Sources said that a team of Thai police located them at Hotel Indigo in Patong, Phuket, based on their travel and passport details and seized their belongings and luggage. Their pictures in Phuket police's custody were released on Thursday and showed the duo handcuffed. They were subsequently shifted to the immigration detention centre where they are likely to be lodged till their deportation. The cops are hopeful of the brothers' return to India by the end of this week with formal channels in communication with each other. India and Thailand had signed a formal extradition treaty in 2013, which came into force in 2015.A team has been sent to Phuket to coordinate the deportation, sources said. The brothers have turned 'wanted' after fleeing the country following last week's blaze at their club in Goa that claimed 25 lives. They had fled to Phuket, Thailand and were staying at a hotel.Goa police had requested Interpol, through MEA and CBI, for their apprehension. A blue corner notice was subsequently issued against them by Interpol.The regional passport office in Delhi had issued a notice to the brothers seeking an explanation from both as to why action should not be initiated to impound their passports within seven days. Their passports were subsequently declared invalid, easing the execution of Indian request for their detention.According to Goa police, the brothers purchased seats on a Phuket-bound flight at 1.17 am on Dec 7, even as firefighting operations were under way. By 5.30 am, they were airborne on IndiGo flight 6E-1073.By morning, a Goa police team had reached Delhi with an arrest warrant for the Luthra brothers and searched their residential and office premises, but they were not found. ""Since they were unavailable, a notice under the appropriate sections of law was pasted at their residence. By the evening of Dec 7, a lookout circular was issued against both by the Bureau of Immigration at the request of Goa police,"" a police officer said.The blaze broke out around 11.45pm Saturday (Dec 6) during an event attended by more than 150 tourists. A preliminary investigation by Goa police and Directorate of Fire Services found it was triggered when electric firecrackers struck the wooden ceiling. As flames coursed through the roof, guests and performers bolted. While most of them were able to step out of the club, many were trapped in the basement after the exit caught fire.Besides a partner named Ajay Gupta, five staff members of Birch, chief general manager Rajiv Modak, gate manager Priyanshu Thakur, bar manager Rajveer Singhania, general manager Vivek Singh, and operations manager Bharat Kohli have been arrested till now.","Goa club owners saurabh & gaurav luthra arrested in phuket after deadly fire.duo purchased flight tickets on dec 7, lookout circular issued within 24 hrs.
