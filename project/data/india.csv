'True chauvinist and anti-nationals are Hindi zealots': Tamil Nadu CM Stalin's fresh attack on NEP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/true-chauvinist-and-anti-nationals-are-hindi-zealots-tamil-nadu-cm-stalins-fresh-attack-on-nep/articleshow/118747036.cms,"Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin (PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing debate over the three-language policy in the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin has once again taken a strong stand against the BJP-led central government. On Thursday, he used a famous quote to target the Centre's stance on language policy, saying:""When you are accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression.""In his post on X, Stalin said that this quote reminded him of how some ""entitled bigots"" brand Tamil Nadu’s demand for linguistic equality as chauvinistic and anti-national. He accused BJP leaders of questioning the patriotism of the DMK government , despite its contributions to national causes, stating, ""The very people who glorify Godse’s ideology have the audacity to question the patriotism of DMK and its government that contributed the highest amount of funds during the Chinese Aggression, Bangladesh Liberation War, and Kargil War, while their ideological forefather is the one who assassinated 'Bapu' Gandhi.""Stalin continuing his attack on Centre, said that demanding linguistic equality should not be considered chauvinism, adding, ""Chauvinism is naming the three criminal laws that govern 140 crore citizens in a language that Tamils cannot even pronounce or comprehend by reading. Chauvinism is treating the state that contributes the most to the nation as second-class citizens and denying its fair share for refusing to swallow the poison called NEP.""He warned that forcing any language upon people creates enmity and weakens national unity. ""The true chauvinists and anti-nationals are the Hindi zealots who believe their entitlement is natural but our resistance is treason,"" he said.A day earlier, Stalin had also criticised the Centre, urging it to take meaningful steps to support the Tamil language rather than engaging in symbolic gestures. He questioned the BJP’s claim that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has great love for Tamil, arguing that such sentiments are not reflected in action. ""If the BJP's claim that our Hon'ble PM has great love for Tamil is true, why is it never reflected in action?"" he asked.He called on the government to consider concrete measures instead of symbolic acts, stating, ""Rather than installing Sengol in Parliament, uninstall Hindi from Union government offices in Tamil Nadu. Instead of hollow praise, make Tamil an official language on par with Hindi and allot more funds for Tamil than a dead language like Sanskrit.""In response, BJP Tamil Nadu chief K Annamalai questioned the DMK’s efforts in promoting Tamil beyond the state’s borders. ""What were your achievements in propagating our Tamil language beyond the borders of TN while in power in the State and the Centre? Did anyone obstruct DMK from doing it?"" he asked.He also pointed out that the Tamil Development Centre programme was launched by the previous AIADMK government and challenged Stalin’s role in expanding it. ""What efforts have you taken to roll out the Tamil Development Centre programme commenced by the previous AIADMK regime?"" he added.","Stalin used a famous quote to target the centre's stance on language policy.

Fount of prosperity at Sangam? Boatman 'earned Rs 30 crore in 45 days of Maha Kumbh',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fount-of-prosperity-at-sangam-boatman-earned-rs-30-crore-in-45-days-of-maha-kumbh/articleshow/118746846.cms,"Pintu Mahara, his brother and mother Shuklavati Dev

PRAYAGRAJ: A wooden boat glided smoothly towards Sangam - the sacred confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and invisible Saraswati. Rhythmic chants of ""Har Har Gange"" blended with the gentle splash of oars. At the helm stood Pintu Mahara , guiding his passengers towards their spiritual rendezvous and his destiny toward prosperity.For Pintu and his kin, the 45-day Maha Kumbh was not just a gathering of millions - it was a tide of fortune that lifted their once-struggling family to uncharted heights.CM Yogi Adityanath recognised the boatman's success, sharing his story in the UP assembly on Tuesday and claiming the family's earnings touched Rs 30 crore. Pintu remained discreet about the figure but admitted it was an ""unprecedented"" windfall.It was no mere stroke of luck but the result of sharp business acumen honed over years. Recalling the bustling crowds of 2019 Kumbh, Pintu sensed the winds shifting and prepared to ride the crest of this spiritual wave. The boatman from Arail ghat made a bold and calculated gamble: he expanded his fleet from 60 to 130 boats. Each vessel, manned by a member of his extended family, ferried eager pilgrims across the holy waters.""Millions of devotees arrived in Arail, which resulted in a rise in our income,"" he said. A ride for 10 passengers, usually priced at Rs 6,000, soared to as much as Rs 30,000 during the peak of Kumbh.For Pintu's mother Shuklavati Devi, the change was nothing short of divine intervention. ""The family was in financial doldrums after the death of my husband. In such a situation, Maha Kumbh came as a saviour,"" she said.Pintu's success was not an isolated tale. More than 4,500 boatmen, many from nearby districts like Kaushambi, Fatehpur, Pratapgarh and Bhadohi, saw their earnings swell, turning their once-humble occupation into a thriving business.","The 45-day maha kumbh was not just a gathering of millions - it was a tide of fortune that lifted their once-struggling family to uncharted heights.cm yogi adityanath recognised the boatman's success, sharing his story in the up assembly on tuesday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118746915,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-975683,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
ED summons 11 deported from US for quizzing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-summons-11-deported-from-us-for-quizzing/articleshow/118746800.cms,"Photo/Agencies

CHANDIGARH: In a bid to zero in on travel agents involved in selling the 'American dream' to Indian residents and sending them to US through 'dunki' routes, ED on Tuesday sent summons to 11 illegal immigrants deported from the US recently.It has also initiated a probe under PMLA to trace the proceeds of crime.Well-placed sources told TOI that ED asked the 11 to appear at its office in Jalandhar on different dates, and ""at least one"" of the 11 was from Haryana, while the rest were from Punjab.According to preliminary data gathered by state officials after interviewing Punjab deportees at Amritsar airport, more than Rs 44 crore was paid to travel agents, with each person shelling out Rs 40 lakh-Rs 50 lakh on an average to reach the US illegally.A total of 131 deportees belonging to Punjab arrived in four batches after the Trump administration started mass deportation of ""illegal aliens"" soon after taking over on Jan 20.The sources said ED began the investigations by arranging details of the deportees ""on its own"".Of the 15 cases it initially analysed, it managed to get the ""details and addresses of 11 deportees"".Punjab Police have registered around two dozen FIRs on the complaints of the deportees, and ED has not yet officially sought any details from them, the sources said. The debriefing of deportees and the police complaints lodged by them point to a well-oiled network of agents who operate the 'dunki route' in a chain that involves touts and agents in several countries. This network makes the prospective illegal immigrants traverse through air routes, forests and rivers to reach Mexico, and then cross over to the US.The deportation flights to India started last month, with the first batch of 104 illegal immigrants, of which 31 were from Punjab, landing in Amritsar on Feb 5 on a US military plane. The second flight, which landed on the night of Feb 15, had 116 illegal immigrants, including 65 from Punjab. On the third flight that landed on Feb 16, 31 of the 112 deportees were from the state. The last batch of 12 deportees arrived on Feb 23 on a commercial Turkish Airlines flight originating from Panama. The flight landed in Delhi, and four from Punjab were part of this group.","Ed has sent summons to 11 illegal immigrants deported from the us recently.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday took strong exception to the Uttarakhand govt spending compensatory afforestation funds and penalties paid for diversion of forest land, that were to be utilised for re-creation of forest, for purchase of laptops, iPhones, fridges and coolers, and sought the state govt's response within a fortnight.Amicus curiae and senior advocate K Parameshwar placed the CAG report on utilisation of the CAMPA funds before a bench of Justices B R Gavai and K Vinod Chandran. The report said: ""At the divisional level, Rs 13.9 crore were diverted/expended on inadmissible activities like state scheme-Harella, tiger safari work, renovation of existing buildings, expenses on personage visits, court cases, purchases of iPhone, laptops, fridges, coolers, stationary, etc.""The bench said, ""Utilisation of huge funds from CAMPA for such inadmissible items and activities is a serious matter. We direct the chief secretary to file an affidavit by March 19 explaining how such huge funds were spent on such activities. If we do not get a satisfactory answer, we may require his personal presence in court on March 20.""Diversion of CAMPA funds to the tune of Rs 2.7 cr was made at Kalagarh Tiger Reserve for construction of internal path/six-metre-wide tiger safari road, modernisation of forest rest house, construction of forest guard chowkis and elephant protection wall, watch towers as well as removal of lantana. The CAG said, ""These activities were not permissible under Rule 5(4) of the Compensatory Afforestation Fund rules and conditions in the approved Annual Plan Operations by National Authority."" The CAG evaluates the effectiveness of CAMPA and implementing agencies during 2019-22 in implementing the Act and Rules made thereunder.The CAG also flagged the inequitable distribution of CAMPA funds. It said, ""The release of funds was unrealistic and not commensurate with the approved Annual Plan of Operations. The state authority failed to ensure equitable and need based funding of activities in all the implementing agencies.""""There was inefficiency/ineffectiveness in funds release, not adopting accounting procedures as per Compensatory Afforestation Fund rules and not discharging of interest liability. Besides, the state authority did not control the diversion/inadmissible expenditure from the state compensatory afforestation fund,"" it added.The CAG also noticed that the afforestation activities in the state have yielded low returns. ""The overall average survival percentage of plantations was 33.5% which is lower than the mandated 60 to 65%. In the test checked three divisions - Nainital, Pithoragarh and Rudraprayag, the survival rate at plantation sites was very low mainly because of non-suitability of the landscape or poor advance soil work before plantation,"" it said.","Supreme court takes strong exception to uttarakhand govt spending compensatory afforestation funds.

NEW DELHI: BJP and Congress launched a scathing attack on Aam Aadmi Party national convener Arvind Kejriwal questioning scale of the security convoy that accompanied him on Tuesday as he arrived in Hoshiarpur in Punjab for a 10-day Vipassana meditation retreat and his continued access to privileges even as he holds no office.AAP returned fire alleging that BJP was engaging in an ""unnecessary slander campaign"" and claimed that Kejriwal was accompanied by security as per the Z plus security cover approved by the ministry of home affairs. Hoshiarpur SSP Sandeep Kumar Malik said Kejriwal was Z-plus protectee and the security cover was provided to him accordingly.Since losing Delhi polls, this is the first time Kejriwal has left Delhi and his decision to choose Punjab for Vipasanna meditation has yet again given rise to speculations of whether he is now looking at a bigger role in Punjab.Last week, the surprise announcement by AAP of its Rajya Sabha MP Sanjeev Arora's candidature for contesting the yet to be notified bypoll for Ludhiana West constituency in Punjab on Wednesday triggered speculation that the vacancy in Upper House was being created to eventually make way for Kejriwal's entry to Parliament. AAP leadership rejected the claim.A fresh controversy broke out when a video showing Kejriwal's 21-vehicle cavalcade went viral online on Wednesday as it entered the forest rest house in Chauhal, Hoshiarpur, on Tuesday night. Another video of him going to a vipassana centre in Anandgarh village, 12 km from Hoshiarpur, emerged in which the vehicle count was close to two dozen.""After losing the election, he is now looking for a Rajya Sabha seat because he is addicted to a luxurious lifestyle. Vipassana is just an excuse, the real reason for his presence in Punjab is the turmoil in AAP's Punjab unit,"" Delhi BJP President Virendra Sachdeva alleged as he spoke to PTI Videos.Congress too stepped up its attack on AAP with Punjab leader of opposition Partap Singh Bajwa and other representatives alleging that Punjab's resources were being blatantly misused while AAP had no qualms in flaunting VVIP culture. They highlighted that when AAP formed a government in Punjab, Kejriwal and Mann said that those who demand security should leave politics.","Aam aadmi party national convener arvind kejriwal arrived in hoshiarpur in punjab for a 10-day vipassana meditation retreat.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday sought assistance of solicitor general Tushar Mehta in resolving the grievance of Indian Forest Service officers against their performance appraisal reports (PARs) being written by IAS officers as per the last June office order issued by Madhya Pradesh government.A bench of Justices B R Gavai and K Vinod Chandran was dealing with a petition filed by Gaurav Bansal who has challenged the state's new mechanism for PAR of IFS officers that changed the PAR authority from divisional forest officers (DFOs) to Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (PCCF). IFS officers are objecting to their PARs being written by non-forest officers. Justice Gavai said IAS officers tend to boss over IFS officers and there is always a tussle between these two cadres. The IFS officers feel that the IAS officers do not know the intricacies of the forest conservation and wildlife protection steps taken by them and hence their performance appraisal by the IAS officers is bound to be error prone.""It should be resolved,"" the bench said. Mehta said he will deliberate on the issue and discuss with the stakeholders but hinted that the administrative hierarchy is well established and who would write which officer's PAR is provided for.The SC had earlier taken exception to the June 29, 2024, office order and warned that if it is not withdrawn then it may initiate contempt proceedings for issuance of the order in violation of the SC's orders.MP IFS Association had written a protest letter to CM Mohan Yadav highlighting the critical role played by forest service officials in wildlife and forest conservation and argued that the new PAR mechanism would demoralise these officers.The IAS officers supported the new mechanism saying four other biodiversity rich states - Karnataka, Odisha, Maharashtra and Rajasthan - have already implemented similar rules.",Supreme court seeks assistance of solicitor general tushar mehta in resolving grievance of indian forest service officers.

NEW DELHI: Actor-politician Kamal Haasan sharply rebuked the central government over Lok Sabha seats delimitation. He questioned the ""real motive"" behind the PM Modi-led government's move to skip census and dubbed it as the move to create ""Hindia"".""This arbitrary decision is part of that same pattern,"" he said at the the all-party meeting on Wednesday.

This move undermines federalism and is entirely unnecessary,"" he said""Not just today, not just tomorrow, but at all times, keeping the number of parliamentary representatives unchanged is crucial to preserving democracy, federalism, and India's diversity. As an Indian, a Tamilian, and on behalf of Makkal Needhi Maiam, I strongly emphasize this,"" he added.Haasan condemned the Union government for overstepping into states' affairs, selectively allocating extra funds to poll-bound states while neglecting Tamil Nadu ’s fair share of resources. He also accused the Centre of using financial aid as leverage to enforce the Hindi language under the pretext of a ""three-language policy,"" pressuring state governments into compliance.He joined in Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin in opposing the Lok Sabha seats delimitation and said that if representation needed to be expanded, it should be at the state level, as all central government decisions are implemented by the states.Also read: 'Threat to federalism': Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin leads all-party pushback against population-based delimitation ""If at all, they have to increase the number of seats, all govt decisions made in the centre are executed by the states.

The disciplinary notice and its reply are going viral.

NEW DELHI: A UP constable who was recently show-caused for being late in a morning meeting blamed his wife as he said he can't sleep at night as his wife comes in his nightmare. The reply went viral prompting the officials to investigate the identity of the constable and whether he actually wrote it, news agency PTI reported. ""My wife gives me nightmares, which keep me awake at night and cause delays,"" the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) constable in Uttar Pradesh's Meerut wrote in his response. An inquiry has been ordered since the reply has gained traction on social media, Commandant of the 44th Battalion PAC Sachindra Patel told PTI on Wednesday.A notice was issued on February 17 by Battalion In-Charge Dalnayak Madhusudan Sharma to the PAC constable for negligence in duty. The notice accused the constable of arriving late for a morning briefing on February 16, being improperly groomed and frequently missing unit activities, which was deemed a serious violation of discipline.The constable responded, saying he suffers from insomnia due to ongoing marital disputes.""My wife sits on my chest and tries to drink my blood with the intent to kill me,"" the constable wrote describing his nightmares.As a result, he claimed, he is unable to sleep at night, leading to him being late for the official briefing. He further said he is under medication for depression and irritability, and that his mother is suffering from a nerve disorder, which is also adding to his distress.At the end of the reply, the constable made an emotional plea, saying he has lost the will to live and ""wishes to surrender"" himself to god's feet.He requested his superiors to end his suffering by guiding him towards spiritual salvation.An investigation is also underway to determine how the letter found its way to social media platforms, PTI reported.",Up constable who was show-caused for being late in a morning meeting blamed his wife as he said he can't sleep at night as his wife comes in his nightmare.

NEW DELHI: AIADMK chief Edappadi K Palaniswami 's recent remark urging people to ""wait for six months"" when asked about a potential alliance with BJP has set off speculation of a tie-up with BJP ahead of next year's assembly polls.BJP, which contested Lok Sabha polls independently, polled 11.4 per cent votes - an impressive share in a territory which is not seen as hospitable for the party-but failed to win a single seat.More importantly, the failure to sew an alliance with AIADMK which remains strong, saw DMK along with Congress and other allies sweeping the 39 seats.The apprehension of a repeat appears to have led the party to revisit the issue, and this time the state chief, former IPS, K Annamalai, who was opposed to the idea of partnering AIADMK, is said to have mellowed down.Responding to Palaniswami's statement about state BJP, Annamalai echoed a similar sentiment, saying, ""For BJP too, no party is an enemy. Our goal is to defeat DMK.""Known for his 'barefoot penance"" protest against DMK rule and past criticisms of AIADMK icons, Annamalai has softened his stance toward the latter. ""There's enough time to decide on an AIADMK alliance...

Karnataka may revive 4% Muslim quota proposal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-may-revive-4-muslim-quota-proposal/articleshow/118743514.cms,"Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah

BENGALURU: Karnataka government is set to reintroduce a proposal granting 4% quota for Muslim contractors in public civil works, nearly a year after dropping the idea amid controversy and allegations of appeasement politics.The move is seen as an effort by CM Siddaramaiah to consolidate support among Ahinda (a Kannada acronym for minorities, backward classes, & Dalits) - a Congress vote base.The government is planning to amend Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurements Act , 1999, in the assembly's current budget session to bring in the reservation. The finance department has prepared a blueprint, and law and parliamentary affairs minister HK Patil has reportedly given approval to the amendment.Karnataka reserves 24% of civil work contracts for SCs and STs, 4% for OBC category-1, and 15% for OBCs in category-2A. These reservations collectively account for 43% of the total contracts.If the proposed 4% Muslim quota is implemented under category-2B, overall reservation in govt contracts will increase to 47%, with ceiling being doubled to Rs 2 crore.During his first tenure as CM (2013-18), Siddaramaiah introduced reservation in govt contracts for SC/ST contractors. Earlier this year, two OBC categories were granted similar benefits. Communities like Besta, Uppara, and Dalit Christians fall under category-1, while Kurubas, Idigas, and over 100 other communities are part of category-2A. Siddaramaiah belongs to Kuruba community.Karnataka govt's push to expand reservations in public contracts has irked contractors from Vokkaliga and Lingayat communities, who do not receive such benefits.BJP has strongly opposed the move, calling it ""unconstitutional"" and an example of ""appeasement politics"". ""We oppose Congress govt's policy of dividing society based on religion,"" BJP state chief BY Vijayendra said. ""Congress sees only Muslims as minorities, ignoring other genuinely marginalised communities. Muslims already have reservations in education and employment, which goes against the Constitution.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Wednesday took a swipe at Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin over asking more fund for Tamil than ""dead language like Sanskrit.""In a post on X, BJP Tamil Nadu President K Annamalai questioned Stalin’s efforts to spread Tamil beyond the state and claimed that the Tamil Nadu CM deliberately despirtualised Thiruvalluvar to suit his propaganda.""Thiru @mkstalin, instead of listing what you have done to propagate our Tamil language beyond the confines of our State, knowing there aren't any, you've decided to move on to the next topic. It was not our claim; it is a reality, and the Sengol today also stands as a testament in the Parliament to our Hon PM Thiru @narendramodi avl’s commitment to spreading the Tamil language and culture.His comments came after Stalin on Wednesday called out BJP's actions, urging them to make Tamil an official language, halt Hindi imposition, and allot more fund for Tamil than Sanskrit.Stalin said, ""Rather than installing Sengol in Parliament, uninstall Hindi from Union government offices in Tamil Nadu. Instead of hollow praise, make Tamil an official language on par with Hindi and allot more funds for Tamil than a dead language like Sanskrit.""He added, ""Stop the desperate attempts to saffronise Thiruvalluvar and declare his timeless classic, Thirukkural, as India's National Book.""Replying to Stalin's post, Annamalai said, ""Only a Hypocrite would ask about the increased allocation of funds to Sanskrit over Tamil, knowing the rationality behind it very well. We are calling you a “HYPOCRITE” because this is the allocation for the development of Sanskrit & Tamil between 2006-14. Sanskrit: Rs 675.36 Crores Tamil: Rs 75.05 Crores What were you doing back then?""He also asked the Tamil Nadu CM what he did when former home minister Thiru P Chidambaram submitted over 170 recommendations to popularise Hindi nationwide.""Thiru MK Stalin, you deliberately despirtualised Thiruvalluvar to suit your propaganda. Search for cheerleaders elsewhere for your defunct propaganda. Your hatred has blinded you from seeing a locomotive named after our great Rani Velu Nachiyaar. You had a problem with Vande Mataram back then and have a problem with Vande Bharat today. Doesn't come as a surprise to us!"" he added.The language policy dispute has flared up again in Tamil Nadu, where the DMK government stands in opposition to the central government's trilingual approach outlined in NEP-2020. The state administration has consistently rejected the three-language framework, which has existed as national policy since 1968 and was reinforced in 1986. Despite its long-standing status, Tamil Nadu has refrained from putting this policy into practice.","Bjp tamil nadu president k annamalai questioned stalin’s efforts to spread tamil beyond the state.

Poll What is most important in the justice system? Proper Investigation Fair Trial

KANPUR: The phone rang in a small home in Goyera Mughli village of Banda in UP's Bundelkhand. It was February 15. A voice - familiar yet carrying the weight of impending finality - broke the silence. ""This is my last call,"" said Shahzadi Khan , 33.A hush fell over her family. Her brother Shamsher gripped the phone tighter. ""They asked me about my final wish,"" she said, further adding, ""I asked to speak to ammi and abbu.""Her mother gasped in the background, reaching for a daughter who was facing execution after being convicted of murdering a four-month-old child thousands of miles away in Abu Dhabi - too far to hold, too close to lose. And then, silence. Shahzadi was gone.""We did not hear from her afterward,"" Shamsher said Monday. They searched. They begged for news, combing through bureaucratic barriers, unanswered pleas. ""We filed a writ petition in Delhi high court, where we were informed Monday about her execution,"" the brother said.Executed on February 15 - the same day she made her last call. No one knew how. No one knew where her remains lay. Only that it was over. ""Her last rites will be held on March 5,"" additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma said in court.She had left India in search of healing. ""Shahzadi had childhood burn scars on her face,"" said her brother. The scars had always made her self-conscious. ""She wanted to have them removed,"" Shamsher said. When a man named Uzair from Agra reached out on social media, promising help - a chance for plastic surgery in UAE - she dared to dream.She reached Abu Dhabi in Dec 2021 on a legal visa. Upon arrival, Uzair sent her to the home of his relative Faiz, where she was kept as a domestic worker. No surgery, no transformation - only labour and confinement in an unfamiliar world.In Aug 2022, Faiz's wife gave birth to a son and Shahzadi was assigned as the baby's caregiver. Four months later, on Dec 7, the child received routine vaccinations. By nightfall, he was gone.Fazi's grief turned to fury. Shahzadi was accused of killing the infant. She was handed over to Abu Dhabi police on Feb 10, 2023, and was sentenced to death on July 31. She remained in Al Wathba prison until her execution.Her father Shabbir Khan fought relentlessly, sending pleas to anyone who would listen - letters to the President, appeals to the PM. But the clock ran faster than justice. Shamsher demanded his sister's body for a dignified burial at their ancestral home and called for an independent probe, considering their FIR against Uzair for human trafficking ""Uzair deceived my sister with false promises, taking Rs 3 lakh in cash and jewellery from her while also collecting the same amount from his UAE relative to provide them with a maid,"" he said. ""She was a victim, not a criminal. She was innocent,"" Shamsher said. ""She only wanted to fix her scars."" But what of the deeper scars - the ones left behind?",Shahzadi khan was convicted of murdering a four-month-old child in abu dhabi. The 33-year-old was sentenced to death and executed on february 15.

NEW DELHI: Another petition has been filed in Supreme Court challenging the validity of Places of Worship Act , alleging that the law is unconstitutional as it not only closes the doors of mediation but also takes away the power of the judiciary to adjudicate controversy over many disputed religious structures .Challenging validity of Section 4 of the Act which bars jurisdiction of court on declaration of the religious character of Places of Worship Act, the petition said it prevented judicial review which is one of the fundamental aspects of the Constitution and the prohibition undermines the authority of judiciary.""This provision not only closes the doors of mediation but also takes away the power of the judiciary. The legislature cannot take away the power of the judiciary to preside over disputes. This has been done through colourable legislation. If these matters are not fit to be in court, does the legislature have the power to decide so? Even to see whether the issue is fit to be raised in Court or not, it will have to go into the Court. And that power has been encroached upon by the legislature.

DEHRADUN: A motor bridge connecting Govindghat to Hemkund Sahib and the Valley of Flowers National Park collapsed due to a massive landslide on Wednesday. The landslide was triggered by boulders tumbling down the hillside near Govindghat in Chamoli.The bridge was located on the Badrinath National Highway , the main route for the 4km stretch from Govindghat to Pulna village. From there, visitors are required to trek to Hemkund Sahib, a popular shrine of the Sikh community, and the Valley of Flowers, a Unesco World Heritage Site. Both the sites are currently snow-bound and not accessed by visitors.An official said multiple villages in the area which are inhabited in the winter months, including Pulna and Bhyundar, were cut off from the district headquarters after the bridge collapsed and several vehicles were stranded across the Alaknanda river.""The landslide struck in the morning. Connectivity to a few villages has been disrupted, and our top priority is ensuring there is no shortage of essential supplies,"" said Chamoli district magistrate (DM) Sandeep Tewari.He added that officials from the public works department (PWD) were sent to assess the damage and propose urgent measures to restore connectivity. ""The plan proposed by PWD officials will be submitted to the govt to ensure the bridge is rebuilt before the Char Dham Yatra begins,"" said the DM.Notably, the portals of Hemkund Sahib gurdwara are set to open on May 25 while the Valley of Flowers National Park generally opens for visitors in June.","The landslide was triggered by boulders tumbling down the hillside near govindghat in chamoli.

Dallewal completes 100 days of fast:

BATHINDA/CHANDIGARH: Punjab farmers' march to Chandigarh following Samyukt Kisan Morcha 's (SKM) call for a week-long protest from March 5 was headed off at multiple points by police, largely restricting the protesters to their districts.The farmers, who moved towards Chandigarh on tractor-trolleys and other vehicles on Wednesday, were stopped on various highways.Chandigarh police, too, put up barricades at Chandigarh-Mohali border points to prevent the protesting farmers from entering the city. Security was also increased at these points, with police personnel checking vehicles, especially buses.Many farmer union representatives, including Joginder Singh Ugrahan, were detained and later released. SKM strongly condemned AAP govt headed by Bhagwant Mann for detaining octogenarian union representatives, including Ugrahan, Balbir Singh Rajewal and Ruldu Singh Mansa, and demanded an apology.SKM said thousands of farmers started protests on roads at more than 35 centres, as they were prevented by police from going to Chandigarh. They claimed more than 15,000 farmers had joined the protests across the state, despite the arrest and detention of nearly 350 farm activists the previous day.Countering Punjab CM Mann's remarks blaming farmer associations for making Punjab a ""state of dharnas"", SKM said farmers did not block road or rail traffic. The traffic blockades in Chandigarh and across the state were not because of the farmers' struggle, but the unwarranted restrictions imposed by Punjab Police and administration, SKM said. Kisan Mazdoor Morcha burnt Punjab chief minister's effigies in Amritsar to protest the police action.SKM (Non-Political) representative Jagjit Singh Dallewal on Wednesday completed 100 days of his fast unto death in support of farmers' demands , especially with regard to MSP. In a statement to mark the day, Dallewal reiterated his resolve to continue his agitation and urged central govt to accept farmers' demands. Mostly confined to his makeshift chamber on Khanauri-Data Singh Wala border of Punjab and Haryana during these three months, Dallewal had participated in talks with Union ministers on Feb 14 and 22. Over the past few days, Dallewal has not come out of the chamber as his blood pressure has been fluctuating. His fast has also affected the functioning of his kidneys.","Punjab farmers' march to chandigarh headed off at multiple points by police.

RAIPUR: A mysterious illness has claimed 13 lives within a month in a remote village in insurgency-hit Sukma district of Chhattisgarh. The administration, however, says there have been five recent deaths, the cause of only two of which is yet to be ascertained.News of the deaths in Dhanikorta took time to reach the administration. A health team was immediately rushed to the village, around 30km from the district headquarters. All the victims complained of chest pain and persistent coughing before their deaths, said sources.Nearly every household in this small hamlet close to Odisha border is affected, the sources said, adding that residents are in panic.Sukma chief medical and health officer Dr Kapil Dev Kashyap told TOI that there have been five deaths ""in recent past"". ""Three died in the district hospital due to age-related ailments and the causes of the other two are being ascertained. The main reason, our health teams have found, is the change in weather, coinciding with mahua harvest time, when villagers go into the forests and collect mahua the whole day. This is leading to dehydration and they are falling sick,"" he said. Kashyap said villagers are given ORS as they are adamant on going to forest to gather mahua.","A mysterious illness has claimed 13 lives within a month in a remote village in chhattisgarh.
