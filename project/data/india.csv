IndiGo Crisis: Inside Pilot Shortage, Rule Change and Winter Delays Behind Over 200 Cancellations

Ten hours on plastic chairs, midnight boarding, pre-match heebie-jeebies. Mumbai City FC ’s journey to a Super Cup semi-final became the face of a nationwide air travel meltdown as IndiGo cancellations and delays left thousands stranded across India.The former ISL champions reached Goa Thursday morning after their Wednesday afternoon flight was cancelled amid widespread disruption. “After nearly 10 hou-rs at the airport, endless que-ues, and enough chaos to test anyone’s match-day patience, the boys stuck together,” the club posted on social media.They were far from alone. At least 14 IndiGo flights to Goa were cancelled and over 25 delayed. Across Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad, Guwahati, Lucknow and Bhubaneswar, terminals overflowed with stranded passengers, rescheduled departures collapsed without warning and airfares spiked to international levels.“My mother-in-law passed away this morning. We paid Rs 40,000 for two one-way tickets to Trivandrum,” said Gopan Nair, stuck at Mumbai airport’s boarding gate after a four-hour delay. “The funeral was postponed so we could attend, but we’re stuck here.”As cancellations mounted, fares turned punishing. One-way economy tickets from Kolkata to Bengaluru surged to between Rs 21,000 and Rs 1 lakh. Same-day fares from Mumbai to Delhi touched Rs 23,000.Kolkata-Delhi fares rose to Rs 25,000–Rs 84,000. “A UK round trip costs around Rs 80,000. People paid nearly that for a one-way domestic ticket,” said Anjani Dhanuka of Travel Agents Association of India.In Kolkata, MBA student Nishita Chowdhury learned her Mumbai flight was cancelled only after reaching the airport, a day before an exam. Avik Sarkar, flying from Bengaluru to Kolkata for travel to Arunachal Pradesh, had his flight cancelled mid-evening. “The rebooking link didn’t work. I had to pay Rs 24,000 for a new ticket. Now I may miss my next connection,” he said.Others arrived — without luggage. Rakesh Rastogi landed in Kolkata after a 14-hour delay only to find his bags still in Delhi. “We came for a wedding. We arrived without our clothes,” he said. CISF reinforcements were called in as tensions rose at the terminal.At Pune airport, 19 delayed and 11 grounded aircraft occupied most parking bays. Some passengers were trapped inside planes for up to five hours after landing. “The captain said even ATC had no clue when we would deboard,” said Megh Gandhi.In Lucknow, passengers shouted slogans against IndiGo. “No updates, no communication, no responsibility,” posted Dhruv Choudhary. Travel agent Sarvesh Pandey discovered his rescheduled flight had departed without notification, costing him two days and a family function.At Chennai airport, there was similar chaos. “People are sitting on the floor. There’s no proper communication,” said advocate Brahma Puthran, whose Kochi-bound flight was pushed back by hours after being cancelled the previous night.In Guwahati, passengers bound for Aizawl said they were told no flights were available for two days. “They promised refunds but no food or hotels,” one traveller said. Some tried humour to cope. “Getting a flight to Mumbai this weekend is like finding a last-minute Coldplay ticket,” one passenger posted.","Mumbai city fc's journey to a super cup semi-final became the face of a nationwide air travel meltdown.

NEW DELHI: Outside Delhi airport 's departure terminal, a young couple with a toddler - their child fast asleep on the mother's lap - sat glued to their phones as the father repeatedly tried reaching IndiGo's customer care helpline after yet another cancellation. Their flight to Mizoram had been cancelled for the second day in a row on Thursday, they said, and the only alternative being offered was a rebooking costing nearly Rs 50,000 - without any assurance that the family would get seats on the same flight.""We came yesterday as well and returned after waiting for hours when the flight was cancelled.

""Our work is getting affected too now.""Pointing to other families waiting alongside them, she said many were in a more difficult position.""Some people have hotels booked, some are tourists. They are stuck because every new option is either full or too expensive,"" she said.While her family could manage because they had relatives in Delhi, others, she said, were being forced to extend stays or switch to connecting flights after direct routes were repeatedly cancelled.A few metres away, another family - travelling with elderly parents - said they had woken up at 6am and travelled from Noida for their 9.45am flight to Patna, after being told to arrive earlier because departure had been advanced by 15 minutes. Upon reaching, they learned the flight had been cancelled. The next available option was a midnight departure - turning a short morning journey into a 14-hour wait.""My wife is 80.

Summing up her experience through the app, she said: ""Holiday became problem. No one explains.""Across the departure gates on Thursday, families sat on luggage, passengers paced between pillars, and several rested in a temporary waiting area set up outside - unsure whether to return home or wait for a last-minute update.

IndiGo Crisis: Inside Pilot Shortage, Rule Change and Winter Delays Behind Over 200 Cancellations

NEW DELHI: Last evening, I was forewarned. “You’re on an IndiGo flight to Bengaluru tomorrow? Their schedule was haywire today. Tomorrow could be chaotic too. Try to change your carrier,” advised a colleague during the evening editorial meeting.I tried. My flight was scheduled to depart at 2.15 pm on Thursday. I rushed to see if I could get a ticket on another airline. But a ticket to Bengaluru had become pricier than a seat at a Taylor Swift concert. Clearly, other carriers were indulging in ‘surge pricing.’ I briefly considered cancelling the trip but finally decided to go ahead. “How bad can it get,” I thought. Silly me!Thursday began well. I received a message in the morning from IndiGo saying they were looking forward to having me on board with the usual advice about what to pack in cabin baggage. There wasn’t the slightest hint of any disruption or inconvenience. “Maybe they’ve sorted out their problems overnight. Or my flight is among the few unaffected,” I thought optimistically.I left for the airport around 11 am, reached T1 around 12.30 pm. My hopes rose further when the information board said IndiGo’s 2.15 pm flight to Bengaluru, 6E 176, would go ahead as scheduled. Even the gate number, 38 in this case, was mentioned.I thanked my lucky stars.The first hint that something was wrong came as I neared Gate 38 and found a crowd gathered around a single person, their voices sharp with anger. But by the time I reached the spot, the crowd had dispersed. “What’s happening?” I asked. One of the passengers enlightened me. “We’re supposed to be on a 10.30 am flight to Bengaluru, 6E 173. But the flight time has long since passed and there’s no information. We spotted an IndiGo staffer and tried asking him, but he’s completely clueless. ”With a sinking feeling, I checked the information board. It still said that my flight was on schedule. I settled down with a history book, still hopeful but a lot less optimistic.Around 1.30 pm, there was a flurry of movement. A gentleman from IndiGo had arrived on the scene, and a crowd formed around him. “Where is the plane?” demanded one person. “The plane is ready, but we don’t have a pilot to fly it,” he responded. “When will you have a pilot? Is the flight delayed or cancelled?” asked the passengers. He had no answers.As he walked away, some angry flyers to another destination, who had been waiting even longer, stood near the gate and began chanting their flight number. “434, 434!” Briefly, a rumour spread that another IndiGo flight was ready for departure. Some ‘434’ flyers began yelling that they wouldn’t allow the flight to take off till their flight left. It turned out that it was another carrier’s flight, not IndiGo’s. The angry passengers watched sullenly as the lucky flyers filed through the gate, some offering sympathetic smiles.By now, it was 1.45 pm. If my plane were to take off on time, boarding would have to start now. The information board was still saying the flight would take off at 2.15 pm. But there was no boarding announcement. I sighed and headed off for a loo break.When I returned, passengers were filing through Gate 38. I rushed to join the queue, which was quite long. After a few minutes, raised voices were heard again. It turned out that this was a long-delayed flight to Chennai finally taking off.By now, my phone was running low on juice, so I plugged in the charger and sat down. A newly-wed couple was sitting next to me and we got talking. “We’ve been here since 10.30 am,” said the husband. “They checked in our luggage and never said a word about the delay. Now even if we want to cancel, we can’t. We’re helpless and stuck.” (He requested me not to publish his name, saying he’s in the Army and not allowed to speak to the media without authorisation).Around 3 pm, there was another flurry of movement. “Don’t you dare touch me,” yelled a furious IndiGo lady staffer at an irate passenger. Tempers were running high. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed. The passenger apologised and the lady calmed down. “So when is 6E 173 taking off?” asked a passenger. “It’s now scheduled for 5 pm,” she said. “What about 6E 176?” asked others. “That will now leave at 6.30 pm,” she said.I sighed and settled back with my book. After half an hour, I again glanced at the information board. It now said my flight would depart at 7.10 pm. But after some time, the timing changed again to 8.20 pm. And the boarding gate shifted to 42. Rumours began circulating. “The flight will leave at midnight”. “The flight will be cancelled.”I called our aviation correspondent. “Can you ask them for a definite time of departure?” I asked. “I can, but I doubt if even they know for sure,” he replied.I thought of all the hours wasted. I thought of having to do it all over again, on the return flight. And I finally caved in and did what I should have done 24 hours earlier.I cancelled my flight.PS: If I thought my ordeal was over, I was mistaken. As I tried to exit the airport, I found a long queue at the security check point. It was for all flyers whose flights had been cancelled, or had chosen to cancel their tickets.‘Tech-unsavvy people’ who had hard copies of their boarding cards simply got them stamped and breezed through. ‘Digital natives’ who had PDFs or had availed of DigIYatra had to show their cards and ID to an IndiGo staffer, who diligently noted their details.I fumed and fretted for an hour, vowing that next time I’d take a hard copy. Still, I was one of the lucky ones, because I had packed all my stuff in a laptop bag and hadn’t checked in any luggage. Those who had checked in their luggage had no idea how to retrieve it. “We’ll probably have to come back tomorrow,” I heard an elderly gentleman tell his wife.A couple of young women who had missed their connecting flight wondered what had happened to their luggage. Was it still in IGI or had it gone to the next destination? They’d probably have to come back the next day to find out too.Just as I reached the IndiGo staffer, he began walking away. Passengers standing behind me howled in protest.“Where are you going? We’ll have a riot,” a CISF lady standing next to him said sharply.He looked like he was about to burst into tears. “I haven’t eaten or drunk anything since 2pm. Can I please get some water at least?” he pleaded.“Get someone to replace you first,” the lady replied curtly.The man sighed, wiped his face and turned towards me. I felt a pang of sympathy for him. I wished that I had a bottle of water to offer him. But all I could do was quietly proffer my phone, for him to note my details.","Indigo crisis: 'plane ready but no pilot' - first-person account of a harried flyer.

Bangladesh Seeks Hasina’s Extradition After Death Verdict As India Weighs Options | Watch

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday permitted the entry of a pregnant woman and her eight-year-old child into India on “humanitarian grounds,” months after the pair had been pushed into Bangladesh.The top court was hearing the Centre’s challenge to the Calcutta High Court’s September 26 order, which struck down the government’s move to deport Sunali Khatun, Sweety Bibi and their families to Bangladesh after labelling them “illegal immigrants.”A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi directed the West Bengal government to look after the minor and instructed the Birbhum district chief medical officer to ensure full medical support for Khatun, including a free delivery.The bench noted solicitor general Tushar Mehta’s statement that the competent authority had agreed to allow the woman and her child into India purely on humanitarian grounds, without affecting any rights or claims, and that they would be kept under “surveillance.”This followed the Supreme Court’s December 1 direction asking the Centre to consider permitting their entry, also on the condition that they remain under “surveillance.”The Supreme Court had earlier asked Mehta to seek instructions on permitting Khatun, who is in an advanced stage of pregnancy, to enter India through the India–Bangladesh border at Malda in West Bengal.The woman’s father said the family had lived as daily-wage workers in Delhi’s Rohini Sector 26 for more than two decades when police detained them on June 18 on suspicion of being Bangladeshi nationals.Sunali, her husband, Danish Sekh and their son were later taken into custody and, on June 27, were deported to Bangladesh.Also read: ‘Night at thana’: Was very scared, couldn’t sleep one bit, says Sunali During the hearing, the bench noted that the woman and her eight-year-old child, allowed to re-enter India, would ultimately be brought back to Delhi, from where they were picked up and pushed across the border in June, as cited by PTI.However, senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Sanjay Hegde, appearing for Khatun’s father, urged the court to direct that she be taken instead to her home district of Birbhum in West Bengal, where her family resides. They also informed the bench that others, including Khatun’s husband, remained in Bangladesh and sought directions for their return as well, subject to instructions from the Centre.Mehta maintained that he would challenge their claim of Indian citizenship, insisting the family were Bangladeshi nationals and that the government’s decision to admit the woman and her child was purely on humanitarian grounds.Justice Joymalya Bagchi observed that if Khatun could establish that she is the daughter of Bhodu Sheikh, it would be sufficient to prove her Indian citizenship.The court has listed the matter for further hearing on December 10.As per a May 2, 2025, memo issued by the union home ministry, Bangladesh and Myanmar nationals found residing illegally in any state or Union territory will first be subject to an inquiry by the respective state or UT government, after which the deportation process will be initiated.","The supreme court on wednesday permitted the entry of a pregnant woman and her eight-year-old child into india on ""humanitarian grounds"" the top court was hearing the centre's challenge to the calcutta high court's september 26 order, which struck down the government's move to deport sunali khatun, sweety bibi and their families.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125738725,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1379982,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Sidda vs DKS: A long rivalry

Kurubas and Vokkaligas are considered rival castes in the state. While Siddaramaiah hails from the Kuruba caste, DKS is from the Vokkaliga community.

Siddaramaiah is quintessentially a politician and is not known for his business ventures. Meanwhile, DKS is one of the richest politicians and has many big business interests.

Shivakumar is known for having friends across different parties in Karnataka. However, Siddaramaiah has soured relationships with BJP and JDS.

Fine-tuned caste arithmetic

Future of Congress

Status quo, Siddaramaiah stays full-term

Mid-term power rotation naming Shivakumar the chief minister

Hybrid compromise — phased transition, date announced publicly

Dark horse

Kharge factor

NEW DELHI: A lot can happen over a cup of coffee. But even after two breakfasts between Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar , the question over the chief ministerial post in Karnataka still remains unanswered.As the Congress government reached the halfway mark in the state, reports quoting Congress sources suggested that MLAs and MLCs from Shivakumar’s faction had camped in Delhi to push the party high command to make him the next chief minister.Now, both Siddaramaiah and DKS are looking towards the party high command in Delhi for answers.However, the cleanup task for the party high command is not going to be easy, as this is beyond personalities. The Karnataka tussle contains loyalty, fine-tuned caste arithmetic and the future of Congress in the state.Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar together scripted the victory for Congress in the assembly elections in 2023. While Siddaramaiah's AHINDA (Minorities, backward classes and Dalits) countered Bharatiya Janata Party's Lingayat-Brahmin voter base, Shivakumar was credited for managing the organisational machinery in the party.However, even during the run-up to the elections, the rift between both the leaders was clearly visible. During the campaign, Sidda and DKS were rarely seen together sharing a stage. It was only at the eleventh hour that Karnataka party president Shivakumar met Siddaramaiah to put up a united front and bring supporters of both the leaders together.Despite being the pillars of the party in the state, the leaders are polar opposites.After Congress won in Karnataka, the high command was in a fix over the CM face. After days of deliberation, the party went ahead with Siddaramaiah's name given his seniority and popularity. However, an agreement was reportedly reached that DK Shivakumar would take over the reins in the second half of the government.Recently, DKS confirmed the ""secret deal"" after he claimed that there had indeed been “a confidential understanding on leadership transition among five-six leaders” soon after Congress won a landslide in the 2023 elections.“This is confidential. I don’t want to speak publicly on this,” he added.Now after the two and a half years are completed, several seers from the Vokkaliga community are supporting Shivakumar's claim to the chief ministership, emphasising that the community had not held the post since the early 2000s.This has created additional pressure on the party as Vokkaligas have around 13–14 percent share in Karnataka's population, making it the second-most dominant landowning caste after Lingayats.Meanwhile, Siddaramaiah, 79 years old, is the tallest Kuruba leader Karnataka has seen. The Kurubas, a significant OBC community forming around 6–7% of the population, have historically lacked an undisputed mass leader until Siddaramaiah built his political philosophy around them.Additionally, Sidda has also built a support base among the AHINDA community, countering the dominance of Lingayats and Vokkaligas.This has added to the dilemma of the high command as picking Sidda would mean sidelining Vokkaligas and going with DKS would mean looking over the AHINDA and Kurubas.Amid the ongoing tussle over the chief ministerial post, the danger of losing majority in the Vidhan Soudha is looming over Congress government's head.There are 23 Vokkaliga MLAs in the grand old party who are supporting DKS. In a scenario where the Congress high command decides to continue with Siddaramaiah as the chief minister, these MLAs who are openly backing DKS can pull out support from the government.Meanwhile, 9 Kuruba MLAs and 34 Lingayat MLAs are supporting Siddaramaiah, making the CM tussle a Catch-22 situation for the high command.With the decision window narrowing, Congress leadership now has three realistic options:This route maintains continuity, protects AHINDA influence, and sends a signal of stability. A cabinet reshuffle may be sanctioned later as compensation to placate those backing Shivakumar.Backers of DKS see this as honouring commitment and preventing factional drift. But replacing a sitting CM at the midpoint could cause internal rupture if not managed delicately.A future-dated swap could satisfy both camps temporarily, provided the timeline is seen as credible and binding. It is the most politically pragmatic formula but only works if both factions stand down simultaneously.Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party floated another theory that Congress may ignore both Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar and choose a “dark horse” for the chief ministerial post in the state.Talking to reporters, former Karnataka CM and BJP MP Basavaraj Bommai said that chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DKS are “being inflexible due to their ego,” leading the high command to consider alternative options.“CM and Deputy CM both have a very egoistic attitude. They are not ready to budge an inch. Therefore, the high command is compelled to think of the other alternative. So in this context, a dark horse might emerge in the state,” Bommai said.Amid the ongoing developments in the state, all eyes are now on Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge who may be the only one with a solution for this deadlock.Kharge, who also hails from Karnataka, is one of the most seasoned functionaries in the state. First elected to the state assembly in 1972, Kharge won nine consecutive elections until 2008, earning the nickname ‘Solillada Sardara’ (the undefeated chieftain).Acknowledging the power tussle between the CM and his deputy, Kharge played down the “internal conflict” within the party and said that the “high command” will sit together and deliberate on the issue.“Only the people there can say what the government is doing. But I would like to say that we will resolve such issues,” Kharge said.“People in high command — Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and I — will sit together and deliberate on this… We will give the medicine when required,” he added.","'we are united...will go to delhi if high command calls': siddaramaiah, shivakumar after meeting. The karnataka tussle contains loyalty, fine-tuned caste arithmetic and the future of congress. There are 23 vokkaliga mlas in the grand old party who are supporting dks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125746445,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1503963,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

(With agency inputs)

BERHAMPORE/KOLKATA: Trinamool suspended Thursday its MLA Humayun Kabir, who had earned the Bengal governing party’s ire by publicly declaring his plan to “lay the foundation of a Babri Masjid-style mosque in Murshidabad on Dec 6”.The belligerent MLA remained defiant despite getting the stick for “communal politics”, declaring he would go ahead with the mosque foundation plan and float his own party by Dec 22. Assembly elections in Bengal are due next year.Kabir was informed of his suspension when he went to attend a rally of CM Mamata Banerjee in Berhampore. At the rally, Mamata expressed anguish without naming Kabir. “If one grain of rice rots, it needs to be removed, otherwise the rest will spoil... There are some insects and pests. They will be there. But when we spot them, we remove them and continue with our work, our way. Hindus and Muslims will live in unity here,” Mamata said.Kolkata mayor and senior TMC minister Firhad Hakim formally announced Kabir’s suspension, saying the decision had been approved by the CM. “He will have no relation with the party from this moment. Anyone can build a mosque. But there must be no communal provocation,” Hakim said, stressing TMC “does not believe in communal provocation” at a time it is working to maintain peace before the polls.Kabir called his suspension “deliberate humiliation”, announcing he would press ahead with the mosque event in Murshidabad’s Beldanga even if that meant getting “arrested or killed” on Dec 6, marking the Babri demolition anniversary. He declared he would resign as Bharatpur MLA and launch his own party, adding it will contest 135 assembly seats (out of 294) next year.Kabir had moved between Congress, TMC and BJP before returning to the governing party.

NEW DELHI: On an average, 485 people died in road crashes every day in 2024, with total fatalities reaching 1.77 lakh, according to road transport ministry told Lok Sabha on Thursday. National Highways (NHs), which account for barely 2% of India’s road network, recorded 54,443 fatalities (31%), the lowest share in past four years.The total number of deaths last year was 2.3% higher than in 2023, when 1.73 lakh people were killed in road crashes. TOI had reported on Nov 5 on the trend for the year, which suggested that fatalities in 2024 would exceed those in the previous year.In a written reply to a question from DMK’s A Raja, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari said, “As per information received from states/UTs, total number of road accident fatalities reported in the country on all category of roads during 2024 were 1,77,177, which includes data in respect of Bengal taken from electronic detailed accident report (eDAR) portal.”Govt has rolled out eDAR system for real-time collection of data. Sources said experience shows eDAR data are largely correct, though there is scope for minor corrections, and hence there may be a slight increase in the number of deaths when the annual report of accidents is published.Data on crashes and fatalities on NHs, also submitted to Lok Sabha, show that accidents on these stretches have decreased — from 1.52 lakh in 2022 to 1.29 lakh — and fatalities have dropped from 56,007 in 2021 to just over 54,000.UP has reported significant decline in deaths on NHs, from 8,446 in 2023 to 5,524 last year. Officials said while this is a positive indicator, greater effort is needed to reduce fatalities on NHs and state highways, which have less network length comparatively but account for around 55% of deaths.“We are improving roads, technologies and vehicles, but there is a lack of education among all categories of road users. This must be addressed through awareness, motivation and enforcement,” said Manoj Bhatt, former DGP of Rajasthan.Experts said govt must involve civil society and a larger pool of non-government entities for large-scale awareness campaigns, rather than relying on only a few organisations, given the magnitude of the crisis.Meanwhile, govt is roping in IIT-Kanpur to use AI for mapping and scientifically analysing high-risk spots on NHs, officials said. They added that this will help identify causes of frequent crashes at specific locations, enabling targeted interventions.The road transport ministry also plans to amend Motor Vehicles Act by introducing stricter norms for issuing driving licences and a negative-points system for dangerous driving that could result in suspension or cancellation of licences.","On an average, 485 people died in road crashes every day in 2024.

‘Not of right age doesn’t mean one can be deprived of rights’

JAIPUR: The Rajasthan HC has held that two consenting adults have the right to be in a live-in relationship even if they have not attained legal age for marriage. The legal marriageable age for women in India is 18 years, and for men, 21. At 18, men and women are considered adults.. Justice Anoop Dhand delivered the judgment on Monday while hearing a protection petition filed by an 18-year-old woman and a 19-year-old youth from Kota. A copy of the order was uploaded Thursday.Both had approached the HC seeking police protection, stating they had entered a live-in relationship by mutual consent.Both had approached the high court seeking police protection, stating they had entered a live-in relationship by mutual consent. The couple executed a live-in agreement on Oct 27, 2025. However, the girl’s family opposed it and allegedly threatened to kill them. The petitioners told the court that despite submitting a written request to the police in Kota, no action was taken.Appearing for the state, Vivek Choudhary, the public prosecutor argued that since the boy had not completed 21 years of age, he could not legally marry, and, therefore, should not be allowed to be in a live-in partnership.However, the HC rejected this reasoning, observing that the “right to life and personal liberty” is guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, and any threat to it amounts to a constitutional violation.Justice Dhand emphasised that the constitutional duty of the State is to protect the life and liberty of every citizen. “Only because the petitioners are not marriageable by law, they cannot be deprived of their fundamental rights,” the court observed.The court also said live-in relationships are neither illegal, nor an offence under Indian law, directing Bhilwara and Jodhpur (Rural) SPs to verify the facts mentioned in the petition, particularly the threat perception, and provide protection to the couple, if needed.","The legal marriageable age for women in india is 18 years, and for men, 21.

UP BLO Deaths Trigger Outrage As Families Blame Extreme SIR Stress While Officials Deny Any Pressure

It’s for the state to ensure that employees deputed as BLOs are fit to carry out the task: SC

NEW DELHI: In a bid to calm the political slugfest over alleged suicides by BLOs due to heavy work pressure of Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, Supreme Court on Thursday said those BLOs unwilling to do SIR work because of health or mental issues should be substituted with other govt employees by states concerned, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.Dealing with a petition filed by a Tamil Nadu political party, TVK, alleging registration of cases against BLOs by EC when many have allegedly committed suicide due to workload, a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said, “The state govt concerned has provided employees to do the statutorily mandated work which is being carried out by EC.”The bench said, “Can the statutorily mandated work be stopped? The states concerned must ensure that they are not posting such employees who are pregnant or having other health issues for the SIR work.”On BLOs’ selection, Supreme Court said, “EC cannot find out which employee is fit for BLO work. It is for the state to ensure that the employees deputed as booth-level officers are fit to carry out the task.”“Once the state puts the employees at the disposal of EC, they are obliged to perform the work. They are not being sent to other states as it was done on many instances in the past.If any or some of the employees are facing difficulty in carrying out the SIR work, the state must replace them,” the bench said.The court issued two directions — one, the states concerned may depute additional workforce with EC to reduce the workload on BLOs; and, second, if any employee, for a specific reason, seeks exemption from SIR work, the competent authority of the state concerned shall consider such requests on case-to-case basis and replace such employee with another employee.The bench clarified that the state is bound to provide a substitute for every employee it exempts from SIR work. “The workforce of employees put at the disposal of EC as BLOs can be increased by the states but under no circumstance it can be reduced,” the court said.Appearing for EC, senior advocate Maninder Singh said the distribution of enumeration forms have been 96% complete in Tamil Nadu and 86% in Uttar Pradesh.TVK’s counsel G Sankaranarayanan told the court EC should not register FIRs against BLOs for not meeting the target or laxity. The bench said FIRs were registered in Noida alone in UP and another FIR by Bengal police against EC by the husband of a deceased BLO. “Were there any FIR registered in Tamil Nadu,” Justice Bagchi asked.The bench said, “It is not the first time that FIRs were registered by EC against BLOs. It was done earlier too. What else can EC do? The state govt employees are not under its control. At the same time, the statutorily mandated work must be completed. Let us hope the states provide additional workforce.”Senior advocate Kapil Sibal questioned the hurry to complete SIR, the time can be extendede without overburdening BLOs.For EC, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said the work is going on smoothly, but some political parties are politicising the incidents to create a narrative. “Every BLO is to sign and upload approximately 30 forms a day. Is this too much of a workload,” he asked.","Supreme court on thursday said those blos unwilling to do sir work because of health or mental issues should be substituted with other govt employees by states concerned.

NEW DELHI: A parliamentary committee scrutinising the bill seeking removal of PM, CMs and ministers arrested on serious charges on Thursday unanimously resolved to ask opposition parties, which have decided not to join the panel in protest against the proposed law, to share their suggestions, sources said.The committee headed by BJP MP Aparajita Sarangi held its first meeting and, according to her, all members agreed on the need for “decriminalisation of politics”. She added that the panel would ensure “wide-ranging discussion” with all stakeholders.The constitutional amendment bill proposes that PM, CMs and ministers will cease to hold office if they are in detention for 30 consecutive days on serious criminal charges. Opposition parties such as Congress, SP, TMC and DMK have declined to the join the joint parliamentary committee, asserting that the bill can be used to target state govts for political reasons.The committee has decided to reach out to them.

The panel will be speaking to constitutional experts and lawyers’ bodies as well.In the meeting, sources said, AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi cited different criminal laws, including BNS Section 187, which allows detention of an accused for 90 days, as well as PMLA to argue against the proposed law.Another JPC, which is scrutising the constitutional amendment bill for simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly elections met on Thursday, with Law Commission chairperson Dinesh Maheshwari, a former SC judge, endorsing the proposed law.

Major changes in 20 years in voter rolls: Govt

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday told Election Commission to keep documents ready to counter the allegation by NGO Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) that special intensive revision of Bihar’s electoral rolls failed to weed out more than 5 lakh duplicate voters.For the NGO, advocate Prashant Bhushan alleged before a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that even the duplicate names pointed out by petitioner Yogendra Yadav thro-ugh a presentation before SC in Oct continued to remain on the final voter list published by EC after completion of SIR.Displaying astonishing adamancy, EC refuses to run the deduplication software — which is in its possession — through the voter list which could eliminate the 5 lakh duplicate voters, Bhushan said, adding that the SIR exercise in Bihar lacked transparency at every stage as the commission refused to divulge details of the process it adopted to add or delete names from the final list.After hearing Bhushan, the bench told poll panel counsel Eklavya Dwivedi that “EC must respond to these factual aspects. Keep your records ready. EC is required to demonstrate that it scrupulously followed the rules and regulations set by itself for SIR”. Dwivedi said EC had filed an affidavit stating that the rules, regulations as well as the directions of SC were complied with.Bhushan said the purported exercise was to strike off foreigners and illegal migrants from the voter list, but EC was neither constitutionally, statutorily nor judicially empowered to determine a voter’s citizenship.He said if a BLO found a voter’s citizenship to be doubtful, EC could refer the case to the competent authority. Till the authority took a final decision, which was amenable to appeal before a court, EC could not remove that person from the voter list if s/he claimed in an affidavit that s/he was an Indian citizen, he said.Appearing for a petitioner, senior advocate Shoeb Alam said though the general power for conduct and superintendence of elections was entrusted to EC, the commission could not claim to possess powers beyond what was statutorily prescribed.",Supreme court tells election commission to keep documents ready to counter the allegation.

NEW DELHI: Noting that both partners in a marriage must work to meet individual as well as family needs and aspirations, which include securing good education for their wards, SC has said a child custody dispute between working parents cannot be decided in favour of one of them on the criterion that they work from home. A bench of Justices Manoj Misra and Ujjal Bhuyan remarked that it could not be said that the interests of the child would be better served by the parent who worked from home, than the other who went to office daily.“It is not in dispute that both parents are working parents and, therefore, it is expected that they cannot always be physically with their children. But this cannot be a ground to place the custody of the child with the one who may be temporarily working from home because it is a matter of common knowledge that to meet individual as well as family aspirations, married couples have to work to build a proper home, and most importantly, to secure better education for their ward. .. We, therefore, do not subscribe to the view that if one parent is working from home and the other is not (i.e., has to visit his office for work) then it has to be inferred that child’s interest would be better served if he is placed in the custody of one who does not go to office for work,” the bench said.SC was hearing a custody dispute over a five-year-old boy in NCR. The couple has two children — a boy and a girl, with the former living with the father and the girl with the mother.SC interacted with the minor who wanted the company of his sister but was not willing to leave his father.“What is important is that from our interactions we noticed he was not willing to part company of his father. We also took notice of the fact that his father has a few elder members at home, including grandfather, who are giving company to the child. In such circumstances, having regard to thefact that the male child is now above five years old and hecontinues to be in the same school where he was studying earlier, and he has no issues with his own father and is not willing to part company of his father, an interference with the order passed by HC is not required, particularly in view of the fact that the appellant (mother) has visitation rights as directed earlier by this court ,” the court said.HC, while granting custody of the child to the father, had mentioned he was working from home. SC’s clarification came with this in mind.","Supreme court of india said a child custody dispute between working parents cannot be decided in favour of one of them on the criterion that they work from home.

NEW DELHI: Govt policy think tank Niti Aayog has recommended that licences, permits and NOCs should have perpetual validity, except in cases where renewal is required for reasons of national security, serious harm to public safety, human health, environment, or in public interest, among a series of measures to ensure a “trust-based regulatory framework”.A panel headed by Niti Aayog member Rajiv Gauba has also suggested that inspections be carried out by accredited third parties selected through computer-assisted randomised processes based on risk assessment. Officials said that by ensuring predictability, proportionality and fairness, such a system reduces enforcement burden, promotes innovation and sustains confidence, improving governance outcomes. The suggestions have been sent to ministries and departments.The panel has also suggested that even in cases of renewal of licences, permits and NOCs for reasons such as national security and serious harm to public safety or health, the validity period may be for five or 10 years. It has said that licencing and compliance requirements must be proportionate and graded by risk, and there should be no requirement of prior approvals for licences, permits and NOCs in ordinary cases.“Any activity not explicitly prohibited under the law shall be exempted from prior permission,” the think tank said. It has also said registration may be required for maintenance of database or other important purposes, but these must not be subject to approval or rejection.
