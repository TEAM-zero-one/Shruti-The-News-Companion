MNS, Sena UBT Hit Back

MUMBAI: Closing ranks ahead of the civic elections, the opposition bloc of Sena (UBT), Congress and NCP (SP) will hold a joint rally with Raj Thackeray-led MNS on Nov 1 against “arbitrary and corrupt administration of Election Commission”.The announcement was made Sunday, just after Raj accused EC of inserting 96 lakh fake voters in the electoral lists across Maharashtra for the benefit of those in office. “An attempt is being made to finish off regional parties... 8-10 lakh fake voters have been added in Mumbai and 8-8.5 lakh in Thane, Pune and Nashik each,” Raj said at a party meeting.This will be the first time Congress and MNS cadres will be marching together amid rumblings in the national party’s city unit over an alliance, even though the two parties have been part of the opposition’s meeting with EC on electoral lists. Left parties have also signalled their support for the initiative aimed at bringing the opposition together and keeping the ‘vote chori’ narrative alive ahead of the local body polls.“We will soon announce the time and route of the march in Mumbai... We are going to show the entire country how Maharashtra is fighting to protect democracy,” said Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut at a joint press conference at Shiv Sena (UBT) Bhavan.The meet was attended by NCP (SP) MLA Jayant Patil, Congress functionary Sachin Sawant, MNS functionaries Bala Nandgaonkar and Abhijit Panse, and CPI functionary Prakash Reddy.Raut said people from every district who had lost their right to vote would join the march. “We will show the strength of the voters to the PM, the Union home minister and EC. It is necessary to give a jolt to EC. We also want to tell EC and the rulers in Delhi that Maharashtra is not sitting idle while so much injustice is happening,” Raut said.Raj also asked EC how it would hold local body polls without cleaning up the electoral list. Addressing MNS booth-level agents, he urged them to verify the lists to weed out fake voters. “If polls have to be held peacefully, then clean the electoral list first,” he warned. Without naming BJP, he said the party in office wanted to contest elections by adding fake names to the voters’ list. “It does not matter whether you cast a vote or not. The match has been fixed. What kind of democracy is this?” Raj said.","The opposition bloc of sena (ubt), congress and ncp (sp) will hold a joint rally with raj thackeray-led mns on nov 1.

The agency had attached Royal Rajvilas after the project got entangled in multiple cases of fraud, cheating and money laundering. ED later approached Rajasthan HC, and subsequently, the apex court seeking to withdraw its attachment partially and restore the properties to the fraud victims.“We place on record our appreciation for the efforts made by the learned counsels for parties and ED in restoring the attached properties to secure the interests of genuine and innocent homebuyers,” an SC bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and Alok Aradhe said.ED verified the details of 221 homebuyers and submitted ‘no objection’ in restitution of the properties to homebuyers, except in case of eight, which were marked as beneficiaries of “proceeds of crime”.The restitution will help the 213 homebuyers who had been in throes of anxiety because of protracted litigation of over seven years between the successful resolution applicant Udaipur Entertainment World Pvt Ltd and ED. SC has, however, clarified that it has passed the order on the peculiar facts of the case without going into the merits, and so it shall not be treated as a precedent and questions of law shall remain open to be decided in an appropriate case.","Sc lauded ed for helping the homebuyers.

BENGALURU: The feud between Karnataka deputy CM DK Shivakumar and two of Bengaluru’s most prominent corporate captains — Biocon chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw and former Infosys director TV Mohandas Pai — escalated Sunday over the city’s crumbling infrastructure.Mazumdar-Shaw hit back at Shivakumar’s remarks that those criticising govt’s handling of Bengaluru’s civic issues had a “personal agenda” and had remained silent during previous administrations.“Not true. Both TV Mohandas Pai and I have criticised deteriorating infrastructure in our city to previous BJP and JD(S) govts. Our agenda is to clean up and restore roads,” she wrote on X, tagging the deputy CM’s statement.Pai amplified her remarks, reposting several comments slamming the poor state of roads and public infrastructure.Unfazed, Shivakumar said industrialists who built their fortunes in Bengaluru were now turning against the city. “They are forgetting their humble beginnings and how the city helped them grow. We should not forget our roots,” read a statement from his office after his ‘Walk with Bengaluru’ event.He listed ongoing infrastructure projects — tunnel roads, elevated corridors, double-decker flyovers, and buffer roads — costing more than Rs 1 lakh crore, claiming they aim for “integrated development” of the city.“We have formed five corporations to take governance closer to people,” he added.Later in the day, Mazumdar-Shaw softened her tone and responded positively to the Ejipura flyover project update. “This is a positive development which will greatly relieve traffic congestion and has been 10 years in the making, which previous BJP and JD(S) govts did not prioritise. Putting this on a priority track is a good move by DK Shivakumar,” she posted on X.The public spat underscored growing frustration among Bengaluru’s business bosses and citizens over chronic traffic snarls, delayed civic projects, and governance gridlock in India’s technology capital.For his part, Pai had said the city’s infrastructure was “lagging 10-15 years behind its growth”. He stressed that citizens had the right to demand better infrastructure and criticise govt, saying “ministers are representatives, not ‘maliks’ who should fear free speech — they must listen”",Biocon chairperson kiran mazumdar-shaw and former infosys director tv mohandas pai are feuding over the city's crumbling infrastructure.

DURGAPUR/KOLKATA: Two accused in the Durgapur gang-rape case, Sk Riyazuddin and Sk Safiq, moved a plea before a local court on Sunday for permission to confess their role in the Oct 10 incident.Police officers involved in the probe said if the court accepts the plea, the two may be treated as approvers during the trial.The complainant, a 23-year-old MBBS student at a private medical college in Durgapur, was allegedly gangraped shortly after she had stepped out of the campus with a classmate on Oct 10 evening for dinner.Riyazuddin, Safiq and four other men, including the classmate, Wasef Ali, are in custody.The court on Sunday sent Riyazuddin and Safiq, who had been in police remand since their arrest, to jail custody for two days so they could think over their plea for confession. The court will pass an order on Oct 21.The appeal was filed under Section 183 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, which spells out the procedure for a judicial magistrate to record confessions related to an ongoing criminal investigation.Riyazuddin worked as a guard at the medical college where the survivor studied till he was sacked five years ago for indiscipline. Safiq worked at a local factory.In a detailed statement to police and a magistrate, the survivor said one man pinned her to the ground and raped her in a desolate forested spot, while two others watched. Two other men, who police later identified as Riyazuddin and Safiq, arrived at the spot later.But instead of helping her, they called the rapists to the spot and the five demanded Rs 3,000 from the student. They took Rs 200 that the survivor was carrying and also snatched her cellphone.The other three accused are Nasiruddin Sk, Apu Bauri and Firdaus Sk. The survivor has mentioned in the complaint that classmate Wasef Ali molested her and fled when she was struggling to fight off the attackers.The maximum punishment for gang rape is 20 years in jail and for extortion, seven years in jail.Partha Ghosh, the lawyer representing the survivor, said, “We have filed an appeal that a test identification parade be done quickly.”","Sk riyazuddin and sk safiq moved a plea before a local court on sunday for permission to confess their role in the durgapur gang-rape case.

"EPFO final settlement period extended: PF withdrawal now after 12 months, pension after 36 months; what it means for members",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/epfo-final-settlement-period-extended-pf-withdrawal-now-after-12-months-pension-after-36-months-what-it-means-for-members/articleshow/124554802.cms,"



EPFO subscribers take note! The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members. Under the revised rules, members can now withdraw their provident fund after 12 months of unemployment and their pension after 36 months, PTI reported.The change was approved by the apex decision-making body of the EPFO, the Central Board of Trustees, chaired by Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, during a meeting held on Monday. Earlier, the scheme allowed full withdrawals from both accounts after just two months of continuous unemployment.A senior official explained PTI that the move aims to ensure social security for formal sector workers who typically exit the EPFO after two months of unemployment. “Most of these unemployed youth need to enrol again when they secure new jobs and lose chances of earning pension and other benefits, as an account becomes pensionable only after a combined service of 10 years or more,” the official said.The ministry said the revision will also allow partial withdrawals, enabling members to meet immediate financial needs without affecting their retirement savings or pension entitlements.Additionally, a provision has been introduced to maintain a minimum balance of 25 per cent of contributions in members’ accounts at all times.“This will enable members to enjoy the high interest rate currently offered by the EPFO, 8.25 per cent per annum, along with compounding benefits to build a sizeable retirement corpus,” the statement added.The rationalisation is intended to improve ease of access while ensuring members maintain a sufficient retirement fund over the long term.","Epfo has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members.

PATNA: The INDIA bloc continues to grapple with mounting internal friction, which is beginning to derail its election campaign in Bihar as the filing of nomination papers for the second and final phase of closes on Monday. Some seats have witnessed INDIA bloc partners fielding candidates against each other and none of them withdrew their nominations even on Sunday. Meanwhile, the RJD and Congress have so far not stepped in to quell the dispute, sending a worrying signal to voters.In contrast, the NDA campaign is in full swing. Union minister Amit Shah has returned to Delhi after a three-day tour while union minister Dharmendra Pradhan is currently camping in Bihar. The chief ministers of Goa, Haryana and Tripura have addressed rallies in various parts of the state. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch his Bihar poll campaign from Samastipur on Oct 24.“The INDIA bloc leaders need to sit together and tell the people that ‘we are united’ and there is no conflict among us,” Congress MP from Katihar Tariq Anwar told TOI on Sunday, acknowledging the impact of the internal discord.“But we hope everything will be over by Monday, the last date for filing nominations for the second phase. There must not be any scope for a friendly fight,” he added.Despite the mounting tension, top INDIA bloc leaders have been largely absent from the campaign trail. RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, perceived as the opposition’s CM face, remains in Patna, chalking out strategy at home, while there is no clarity on the campaign plans of Congress leaders such as leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, party president Mallikarjun Kharge and Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi.However, state RJD spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan sought to downplay the concerns. “Tejashwi will embark on a poll campaign after Diwali. Every party in the INDIA bloc wants him to campaign for their candidates. Although Tejashwi has filed his nominations from the Raghopur seat, he is, in fact, contesting elections on all 243 seats of Bihar,” Gagan said.Meanwhile, denial of tickets has triggered dramatic protests across the state. Candidates have been seen rolling on the ground, tearing their kurtas, crying bitterly before the camera and threatening to teach lessons to official nominees. The chaos comes just a fortnight before the first phase of polling on Nov 6.In Patna, RJD leader Madan Shah, seeking a ticket from the Madhuban seat, broke down outside the 10,Circular Road residence of former CM Rabri Devi, tearing his kurta in despair. “Lalu ji promised a ticket from the Madhuban seat, but it was given to someone else. I will die… Can’t bear the pain,” he shouted.Another aspirant, Usha Devi, cried bitterly before the reporters outside Rabri’s residence. “I have been associated with the RJD for the past 20 years and have been the torchbearer of the party in the region, but the ticket went to someone else… This is heart-breaking, but I will still campaign for the RJD,” she said, describing RJD chief Lalu Prasad as a “father figure.”In Gopalganj, former RJD legislator Reyazul Haq Raju broke down during a live online session, expressing anguish over not receiving a party ticket while three-time Congress legislator from Kasba in Purnia district, Afaque Alam, accused party leaders of demanding money in exchange for tickets.“The state unit of Congress has now become hostage in the hands of ‘personal brokers of some leaders’. Ground-level workers who have been struggling for the party for years are being ignored for tickets while outsiders have a field day,” Alam alleged on Sunday.",India bloc partners fielding candidates against each other.

Delhi air turns toxic again: GRAP Stage II curbs kick in; AQI crosses 300,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-air-turns-toxic-again-grap-stage-ii-curbs-kick-in-aqi-crosses-300/articleshow/124689532.cms,"Stop Ignoring The AQI Index: Long Exposure To Polluted Air Can Increase Your Risk Of Heart Attack

NEW DELHI: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Saturday invoked Stage II of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi-NCR after air quality showed a sharp deterioration, crossing into the ‘very poor’ category. The decision follows an emergency review by the Sub-Committee on GRAP, which observed a steady rise in pollution levels through the day.According to the order, “The AQI of Delhi has shown an increasing trend since morning and has been recorded as 296 at 4.00pm and 302 at 7.00pm. The forecast by IMD/IITM also predicts further deterioration of AQI in the coming days.” The Sub-Committee, therefore, decided to implement all measures under Stage II of GRAP with immediate effect, in addition to those already active under Stage I.Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed Delhi’s overall Air Quality Index at 296 on Sunday afternoon—just below the ‘very poor’ threshold of 301. Of the 38 monitoring stations across the capital, 12 reported ‘very poor’ air quality, with Anand Vihar topping the chart at a severe 430. Other hotspots included Wazirpur (364), Vivek Vihar (351), Dwarka (335), and RK Puram (323).The India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported maximum and minimum temperatures of 33.3°C and 20.6°C respectively, with humidity touching 91% by evening.Misty conditions are expected on Monday morning, though temperatures are likely to remain steady.Residents have begun expressing frustration over the annual spike in pollution. “Just like every year, pollution in Delhi persists… It causes difficulty in breathing, especially for cyclists like me,” said Aryan Gupta, a resident of Rohini. He attributed the worsening smog to vehicle emissions, stubble burning, and seasonal fireworks, saying that “closing schools and colleges are temporary solutions.”Stage II, applicable when AQI ranges between 301 and 400, includes intensified dust control, public transport expansion, and restrictions on diesel generator sets. Authorities have ordered daily mechanical sweeping and water sprinkling on roads, especially in high-traffic areas.Power supply agencies have been directed to ensure uninterrupted electricity to curb DG set usage. Public transport services—including buses and metro trains—will be augmented, and parking fees increased to discourage private vehicle use.The CAQM also urged Resident Welfare Associations to provide electric heaters to outdoor staff to prevent open burning of waste or biomass. Additionally, only CNG, electric, or BS-VI diesel inter-state buses will be allowed into Delhi.","The commission for air quality management invoked stage ii of the graded response action plan (grap) across delhi-ncr.

Poll Do you believe the Public Safety Act should be repealed in Jammu and Kashmir? Yes, it should be repealed. No, it is necessary for security.

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Saturday launched a sharp attack against Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah over his demand to remove the controversial Public Safety Act in the Union territory.Owaisi reminded Abdullah that the law has been ""misused"" by every elected and unelected government, which has led to ""untold suffering and human rights violations "".Taking a poetic jibe on J&K CM, Owaisi said, ""The Public Safety Act, 1978 (PSA) was introduced by Sheikh Abdullah in 1978 to deal with smuggling. Farooq Abdullah, G M Shah, Mufti Sayeed, GN Azad, Omar Abdullah & Mehbooba Mufti have all been CMs of J&K. They could have easily repealed PSA & prevented untold suffering and human rights violations.""""The law has been misused by virtually every elected CM & unelected Governors. Over 20,000 people have been jailed since 1978 without criminal charges, fair trials or even a proper appeals process. Some detentions were extended for up to 7-12 years. One separatist was detained under the PSA and, when he was later needed, he was served with a court warrant and granted bail. Now there is a truncated elected govt, and it has dawned on it to do away with the PSA,"" he added.""Sab kuch luta ke hosh mein aaye to kya kiya, Din mein agar chiragh jalaye to kya kiya,"" Owaisi further said.This comes after Omar Abdullah said that an elected government must have control over state subjects, including law and order and security, for it to remove the PSA.""We said in the manifesto that we would remove the Public Safety and Security Act (PSA) from Jammu and Kashmir. To remove it, we must have statehood. Security, law and order, all these things should be under the control of the elected government,"" the JK CM said.""The day these things are ours, I won't even wait for the assembly session.

Originally enacted in 1978 to curb timber smuggling, the law was later invoked to detain political leaders and individuals deemed a threat to public order—particularly during the militancy surge in Kashmir in the early 1990s.One of the most recent detentions under the PSA is that of Aam Aadmi Party MLA Mehraj Malik, who has been lodged in Kathua district jail since September 8, 2025, for allegedly disturbing public order in Doda district and using abusive language against the district’s deputy commissioner.","Owaisi reminded abdullah that the law has been ""misused"" by every elected and unelected government, which has led to ""untold suffering and human rights violations"" omar abdullah said that an elected government must have control over state subjects, including law and order and security.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124683479,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1024508,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Ayodhya celebrated Deepotsav 2025 on Sunday with grandeur and devotion, drawing thousands of devotees to the city along the banks of the River Saryu in Uttar Pradesh.Organised by the state government’s tourism and culture department, the festival marked the ninth edition of the celebration of Lord Ram’s life and legacy.The event featured Ramayana-themed tableaux, folk performances, laser shows, and devotional rituals, lighting up the city with millions of diyas.CM Yogi Adityanath inaugurated the festivities, which also saw the setting of new Guinness World Records, highlighting the scale, spiritual fervour, and cultural significance of the festival.Deepotsav 2025 witnessed two new Guinness World Records.One was for most people performing simultaneous diya rotations, and the other for the largest display of oil lamps, with 26,17,215 diyas lit by the department of tourism, district administration, and Ayodhya authorities.Across Uttar Pradesh, 1.51 crore diyas illuminated homes and public spaces, adding grandeur to the celebrations.Over 2,100 scholars participated in the Saryu aarti, creating mesmerising visuals at Ram ki Paidi.A grand Ram Leela was performed at Ram ki Paidi, accompanied by a spectacular laser and light show that lit up the ghats with colourful visuals.The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Temple in Ayodhya was illuminated during the occasion.A drone show with 1,100 drones performed synchronised stunts over the River Saryu, creating mesmerising patterns that captivated thousands of devotees.To mark the grand occasion, the skies above Ayodhya lit up with a spectacular display of firecrackers, creating vibrant patterns that complemented the sea of diyas below.During the inaugural ceremony, CM Yogi Adityanath performed the ‘Rajyabhishek’ of Ram and Sita, along with pujan, vandana, and aarti.Addressing the crowd, he criticised opposition parties for their past stance on the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, saying, “Today, Uttar Pradesh does not have to face an identity crisis. We are now lighting lamps where bullets were once fired”.He hailed the city’s transformation as a centre of development and heritage, and described Deepotsav as a symbol of India’s spiritual and cultural leadership.“The construction of a grand temple is an honour to India's faith. It is a symbol of a new India. It is a symbol of a united and superior India,” he said, urging citizens to celebrate with devotion and enthusiasm.Hours before the lighting of lamps, UP tourism and culture minister Jaiveer Singh inaugurated a Ramayana-themed tableau procession from Saket College, waving a 'Jai Shri Ram' flag and beating drums.Crowds thronged the streets as 22 tableaux depicting the life and journey of Lord Ram across all seven Kandas — Balakanda, Ayodhyakanda, Aranyakanda, Kishkindhakanda, Sundarkanda, Lankakanda, and Uttarakanda — moved along the Rampath.Music, dance, and dramatic performances brought the epic to life, while devotees showered flowers, lit diyas, and performed aarti along the route.Folk arts from across India, including Haryana’s Phaag, Kerala’s Kathakali, Rajasthan’s Jhumar, Punjab’s Bhangra, Odisha’s Sambalpuri, and West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh’s traditional performances, added a pan-Indian flavour to the celebrations.Officials said the tableaux also showcased the achievements of the Uttar Pradesh government, merging cultural devotion with modern development narratives.","Deepotsav 2025 witnessed two new guinness world records.

The new JD(U) constituency





From inclusion to isolation

India's political history is packed with turning points, each shaping the course of the next decade. And a very few years proved as crucial as 2013. That summer, two decisions were made within a week, which seemed to rewire Indian politics.On June 9, the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) named Narendra Modi the head of its 2014 Lok Sabha election campaign committee, effectively setting him on the path to the prime minister's office.Just seven days later, on June 16, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar walked out of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), bringing down the curtain on a 17-year partnership that had helped him rise to power. Three months later, on September 13, BJP formally declared Modi as its prime ministerial candidate.Nitish struck back, calling Modi a ""divisive"" leader and remarking that the BJP’s decision reflected ""(when misfortune strikes, judgment falters). Political observers saw the break as more than a clash of personalities.Some read it as Nitish’s effort to protect his Muslim vote base in Bihar from the polarising politics associated with Modi's BJP. Others believed it was a calculated move to keep his own prime ministerial hopes alive.Cut to 2025. Nitish Kumar’s JD(U), once the dominant partner in Bihar’s NDA, will this time contest the assembly elections on equal footing with the BJP, with 101 seats each.What stands out even more is who gets those tickets. Of JD(U)’s 101 candidates this time, only four are Muslims. The sharp contrast between the Nitish of 2013 and the Nitish of 2025 begs a single question: What changed?Nitish Kumar's evolution from the inclusionist of 2005 to the realist of 2025 is not a sudden shift. It is the outcome of two decades of political recalibration shaped by alliances, arithmetic, and survival instincts.When Nitish came to power in 2005, his slogan ""(development with justice) was aimed at building a broad coalition that could counter the Rashtriya Janata Dal’s ( RJD ) Muslim-Yadav base.Muslims, who make up around 17 per cent of Bihar’s population, were key to this equation.In his early years, JD(U) fielded 8–10 Muslim candidates, and several of them, like Jama Khan and Aslam Azad, won. Nitish’s outreach to Pasmanda (backwards) Muslims and welfare schemes such as scholarships, hostels, and minority commissions earned him goodwill.By 2010, JD(U) had fielded 14 Muslim candidates, the highest in its history, underscoring Nitish’s attempt to project himself as a centrist who could balance development with inclusivity even while in alliance with the BJP.The split with the BJP in 2013 was presented as a stand on ""secular values,"" but it also had a clear political logic. Nitish sought to preserve his minority base at a time when Narendra Modi was rising at the national level and being projected as anti-minority by the opposition.In the 2015 assembly elections, JD(U) allied with the RJD and Congress, giving thegrand alliance) a strong secular image. Although JD(U) itself fielded only 6–7 Muslim candidates (due to seat-sharing), Muslim representation across the alliance was healthy, and Nitish’s image as a moderate remained intact.Nitish's 2017 return to the BJP-led NDA marked the beginning of a slow but clear retreat from minority politics. By then, BJP dominance had grown both nationally and in Bihar, and Nitish's political leverage had shrunk.Muslim voters, disillusioned by his flip-flops, shifted decisively toward the RJD. For JD(U), Muslim candidates now offer little electoral dividend.In the 2020 Bihar elections, JD(U) fielded just 5 Muslim candidates, down from double digits a decade earlier. By 2025, that number stands at 4, the lowest since the party’s formation.JD(U)'s declining Muslim representation also mirrors the changing power equation within the NDA. Nitish, once the “big brother” in Bihar's alliance, now contests the same number of seats as the BJP, a symbolic indication of how much ground he has ceded.Within such a coalition, there's limited room for independent social engineering. The BJP's voter base is heavily majoritarian, and Nitish's attempt to retain Muslim representation risks unsettling that core. His reduced ticket allocation is as much about coalition management as it is about electoral realism.Today, Nitish leans on what party insiders call his ""3W"" base -- women, weaker castes, and welfare beneficiaries.His welfare measures for women, EBCs, and Mahadalits have replaced the old caste-plus-community model with a beneficiary-driven one. In this arithmetic, Muslim representation matters less; welfare visibility matters more.Two decades ago, Nitish Kumar’s politics revolved around bringing people in. Today, it’s about holding ground. His reduced Muslim outreach does not seem to be driven by hostility, but by calculation.At the centenary celebration of the Bihar Madrasa Education Board on August 21, 2025, CM Nitish Kumar made headlines for what he didn’t do. He declined to wear the muslim headgear offered to him on stage.It was a striking image, not least because a decade earlier, Nitish had taunted Narendra Modi for the same gesture. “To run the country, you have to take everyone along,” Nitish had said then, “at times you will have to wear a topi, at times a tilak.”Back then, it was Nitish jabbing Modi on inclusion. This time, it was Modi’s old line that seemed to echo louder, the one he’d delivered in a television interview: “Muslim children should get better education and ideally, they should have the Quran in one hand and a computer in the other.”At that moment, the roles had reversed. The man who once preached symbolism now sidestepped it.Nitish Kumar's journey captures the arc of India’s coalition-era politics itself, from the optimism of inclusion to the pragmatism of survival.His shift seems to be less about ideology and more about adaptation in an age where political space is shrinking for those who once thrived in the middle.For Bihar’s Muslims, the story of Nitish Kumar is no longer about trust lost or gained, but about a leader who adjusted to the times and, in doing so, quietly redrew the boundaries of his own politics.","Bihar chief minister nitish kumar walked out of the bjp-led national democratic alliance (nda) in 2013. The split with the bjp in 2013 was presented as a stand on ""secular values,"" but it also had a clear political logic. Nitish sought to preserve his minority base at a time when narendra modi was rising at the national level.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124688815,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-30304,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

The bigger picture



Sometimes, the margins of victory can be paper thin — and in a state like Bihar, where allegiances and alliances shift like monsoon clouds, that couldn’t be more true. Every election here is a reminder that even a few hundred votes can redraw political maps.As the 2025 Assembly elections draw closer, attention is turning to constituencies that saw the closest contests last time. In seats like Hilsa, Barbigha, and Dehri, the margins were under 500 votes — outcomes that could have flipped with just a few booths. The JD(U) and RJD had both won and lost such razor-edge battles, and with alliances realigned since then, each of these constituencies is now back in play.Perhaps the most dramatic contest of 2020, Hilsa saw JD(U)’s Krishnamurari Sharan, also known as Prem Mukhiya, edge out RJD’s Atri Muni (Shakti Singh Yadav) by just 12 votes — both polling around 37.35% of the total vote. The seat, part of Nalanda district, has historically swung between the two parties and is expected to be one of the most hard-fought battles this time as well. With Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) and RJD once again on opposite sides, Hilsa could become a litmus test for how voters view Nitish’s return to the NDA.In Barbigha, JD(U)’s Sudarshan Kumar barely managed to stay ahead of Congress’s Gajanand Shahi by just 113 votes. Both polled around 33% each, showing how split the electorate was.The Congress had performed strongly here in 2020 despite limited organisational strength in the area. The party’s persistence in contesting the seat again, despite friction with RJD over seat-sharing, underlines its continued importance to the INDIA bloc.RJD’s Sudhakar Singh clinched Ramgarh by a margin of just 189 votes over BSP’s Ambika Singh, while BJP’s Ashok Kumar Singh was only 2,800 votes behind them. With three major parties within 2% of each other, the 2020 result was one of the tightest three-way finishes in Bihar. RJD hopes to consolidate anti-BJP votes this time, but the BSP’s influence among Dalit voters could again make it unpredictable.In Matihani, the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) created a surprise when its candidate Raj Kumar Singh narrowly defeated JD(U)’s Narendra Kumar Singh by only 333 votes, while CPI(M)’s Rajendra Prasad Singh was just another 400 votes behind. With three candidates each securing nearly 29% of the vote, Matihani remains one of Bihar’s most unpredictable battlegrounds. The left’s continued presence here means even small shifts in alliances could change the outcome dramatically.JD(U)’s Sunil Kumar won Bhorey by just 462 votes over CPI(ML)’s Jitendra Paswan, with both polling above 40%. The Left’s strong showing reflected CPI(ML)’s growing rural base, particularly among Dalit and agrarian voters. With CPI(ML) now a formal part of the INDIA bloc, Bhorey could see a direct face-off between NDA and the Left once again.Another cliffhanger unfolded in Dehri, where RJD’s Phate Bahadur Singh beat BJP’s Satyanarayan Singh by just 464 votes, both polling over 41%. The constituency has often mirrored the broader state trend — a reason why both alliances are expected to deploy senior leaders here this year.In Bachhwara, BJP’s Surendra Mehata edged out CPI’s Abdhesh Kumar Rai by only 484 votes. The contest was a straight Left-versus-BJP duel, with both commanding nearly 30% each. The CPI’s local base here, built over decades, remains intact. Interestingly, CPI is again pitted against the Congress in some seats this time, exposing fissures within the INDIA bloc even as they attempt coordination.Chakai produced one of 2020’s biggest upsets when independent candidate Sumit Kumar Singh defeated RJD’s Savitri Devi by just 581 votes. Singh has since joined the NDA and could benefit from the combined BJP–JD(U) machinery. However, with RJD determined to reclaim the seat, Chakai is once again poised for a close battle — especially with JMM also eyeing influence in the region.Kurhani’s 2020 contest between RJD’s Anil Kumar Sahni and BJP’s Kedar Prasad Gupta ended with just 712 votes separating the two. RJD polled 40.23% to BJP’s 39.86%. Kurhani, located in Muzaffarpur district, has changed hands multiple times and was even the site of a bypoll in 2022. Its outcome this year could reflect whether Tejashwi Yadav’s message of youth and jobs resonates against the NDA’s stability pitch.In Bakhri, CPI’s Suryakant Paswan defeated BJP’s Ramshankar Paswan by 777 votes, both getting more than 43% of the vote. As one of Bihar’s few remaining Left bastions, Bakhri will be closely watched to see if CPI can retain its grip amid the NDA’s push into Scheduled Caste–reserved seats.As the NDA and INDIA bloc prepare for the 2025 polls — with voting scheduled for November 6 and 11 and results on November 14 — these ten constituencies exemplify Bihar’s deep political fragmentation. With Nitish Kumar back in the NDA and Tejashwi Yadav leading a divided opposition, margins as thin as those from 2020 could once again decide the fate of Bihar’s 243-seat Assembly.","Hilsa, barbigha, and dehri were the constituencies that saw the closest contests last time. The jd(u) and rjd had both won and lost such razor-edge battles, and with alliances realigned since then, each of these constituencies is now back in play.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124688881,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1210752,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

‘Why Spend Money On Diyas’: Akhilesh Yadav’s Remark On Ayodhya Deepotsav Sparks Row, BJP Hits Out

'They erased Ayodhya’s identity'



'A festival of truth and faith'



From 1.71 lakh diyas to millions



NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday launched a fierce attack on the Congress and Samajwadi Party, accusing them of “insulting India’s eternal faith” and obstructing the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Speaking at the ninth edition of Deepotsav-2025 in Shri Ayodhya Dham, the chief minister framed the festival as both a spiritual celebration and a symbolic triumph of truth over falsehood.Addressing thousands gathered amid the glow of millions of diyas, CM Yogi alleged that both Congress and SP had worked to “erase Ayodhya’s identity” and hinder the construction of the Ram Temple.“While we are illuminating Ayodhya with millions of lamps, we must not forget that during the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, the Congress party declared in court that Lord Shri Ram was a myth. The Congress party gave an affidavit in the Supreme Court stating that Shri Ram was a myth, and the Samajwadi Party had fired bullets at Ram devotees in this very Ayodhya,” he said.He accused the opposition of double standards, saying, “These are the same people who pray at Babar’s tomb but rejected the invitation to the consecration ceremony of Ram Lalla in the temple at Ayodhya.”Continuing his criticism, CM Yogi said the opposition parties had for decades attempted to undermine the spiritual heritage of Ayodhya.“We must remember their double standards. These are the same people who, during the Ram Mandir movement, deployed separate advocates to prevent the construction of the temple in Ayodhya, so they could protest and create obstacles in the path of the Ram Mandir. But today we can say they fired bullets; we are lighting lamps in Ayodhya,” he said.He further claimed that the previous governments had “erased Ayodhya’s identity” by renaming it Faizabad. “We have restored the name and legacy of Ayodhya, making it Ayodhya Dham again,” he added.Reflecting on the origins of Deepotsav, CM Yogi recalled the humble beginnings of the celebration when his government revived the tradition in 2017.“When we decided in 2017 to organise the first Deepotsav in Ayodhya Dham, the sentiment behind it was singular: to show the world how lamp-lighting should be done and on what occasion it should be celebrated,” he said.He added that the festival symbolised a return to India’s ancient roots: “Thousands of years ago, when the world was living in darkness, Ayodhya had lit lamps to welcome its Lord, its deity, and the arrival of its faith--those very lamps became the great festival of Sanatana Dharma in the form of Deepotsav and Deepawali.”The chief minister also recalled the logistical challenges faced during the inaugural Deepotsav.“When we decided to carry forward that campaign again to keep the spirit of Deepotsav alive, in 2017 we did not have sufficient lamps. We collected lamps from across the state and managed to light 1.71 lakh diyas. Today, millions of lamps are lit in Ayodhya Dham,” he said, calling it a symbol of “the awakening of faith and pride in Indian culture.”","Uttar pradesh chief minister yogi adityanath launched a fierce attack on the congress and samajwadi party.

Bihar elections: 5 tips Congress can take from BJP’s pre-poll playbook - from cadre to alliance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-elections-5-tips-congress-can-take-from-bjps-pre-poll-playbook-from-cadre-to-alliance/articleshow/124687528.cms,"Shah Avoids Naming Bihar CM Face, Says Bihar CM to Be Decided by Elected MLAs

Ground cadre

Alliance discipline and timely seat-sharing

Unified leadership and disciplined message

Candidate selection

Forward-looking campaigning

NEW DELHI: When Chirag Paswan campaigns shoulder to shoulder with BJP leaders, Nitish Kumar fine-tunes his alliance messaging, and BJP’s top brass, from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Union home minister Amit Shah, lead high-pitched rallies, the Congress and its Mahagathbandhan allies still appear tangled in seat-sharing disputes and mixed messaging.As Bihar heads for assembly polls, the contrast between the Congress’s pre-poll uncertainty and the BJP’s methodical campaign machinery could not be starker. While results will tell whether the BJP’s precision planning converts into votes, its playbook offers the Congress five clear takeaways if it wants to regain relevance in the election battleground.The BJP’s biggest strength remains its disciplined network of booth-level workers, nurtured through the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and local shakhas. In the run-up to Bihar elections , both Modi and Shah have frequently interacted with ground volunteers through digital town halls, giving micro-tasks such as voter outreach, welfare-scheme verification, and local mobilisation.In contrast, Congress cadres continue to complain about a top-heavy command structure and weak communication between state and central units, problems that the party’s own post-poll reviews since 2019 have acknowledged.As BJP unveiled its full list of 101 candidates, visuals of Congress workers protesting ticket distribution circulated widely last week, highlighting accusations of bias and lack of transparency within its Bihar unit.To counter BJP’s organisational muscle, Congress must rebuild from the booth up - empower local communicators, reward consistent volunteers, and create digital feedback loops that turn engagement into turnout.In Bihar, the BJP finalised its pre-poll arithmetic well before the nomination window — 101 seats each for BJP and JD(U), 29 for LJP (Ram Vilas), and 6 each for HAM (Secular) and RLM.By contrast, the Congress-RJD-CPI(ML) bloc remains locked in disagreements, with smaller allies voicing frustration over delay and imbalance. Several alliance partners even fielded overlapping candidates as nominations for Phase 1 closed.Early seat-sharing sends a message of clarity and control. Congress needs to close deals before deadlines - visible rifts undermine confidence among voters and cadres alike.The BJP has turned PM Modi into its central brand, letting state leaders campaign under a unified triad of vikas (development), samman (respect), and suraksha (security). In Bihar, it avoided naming a chief-ministerial face, insulating itself from Nitish Kumar’s anti-incumbency while keeping focus on ""Modi ki Guarantee.""The Congress, meanwhile, continues to project fragmented messaging. Its Bihar unit has seen frequent leadership churn, and Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra themes have yet to translate into a coherent local pitch.Elections reward consistency. Congress needs one emotionally resonant storyline, Bihar-specific but tied to national aspirations, that every leader can echo without dilution.The BJP’s ticket distribution appears increasingly data-driven: constituency-level surveys, winnability audits, and digital tracking shape final lists. It has also deployed senior organisational leaders from Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand to supervise tough regions.Congress, by contrast, continues to rely on familiar faces and late entrants. Its own internal reviews (AICC, 2022-23) flagged lack of local credibility as a recurring reason for losses.Winnability, not hierarchy, must guide choices. Congress may benefit from focussing on candidates with local connect and accountability, not just name recall.Congress’s current campaign focuses heavily on warnings of “vote chori” and allegations of voter-roll manipulation. While such themes energise the base, they rarely appeal to undecided or aspirational voters who prioritise jobs, growth, and education.The BJP, by contrast, anchors its message in delivery and promises — publicising welfare “guarantees,” housing schemes, and local infrastructure achievements through Modi’s personal brand.A constructive, Bihar-centric vision, job creation, youth opportunities, and agricultural reform, can help Congress shift from grievance to governance mode.As election dates near, Congress risks being squeezed between the NDA’s organisational machine and newer regional fronts seeking to tap disillusioned voters. The party’s revival in Bihar will depend on whether it can blend a forward-looking local agenda with disciplined alliance management and credible grassroots presence.Without that recalibration, it risks remaining a spectator in a contest increasingly defined by clarity of message - something the BJP has mastered ahead of yet another high-stakes Bihar poll.","The congress and its mahagathbandhan allies still appear tangled in seat-sharing disputes and mixed messaging.

No undue leniency or excessive severity in sentencing: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-undue-leniency-or-excessive-severity-in-sentencing-sc/articleshow/124695123.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has cautioned trial courts and HCs against undue leniency or excessive severity while imposing punishment on a person convicted of an offence and said that deviation from this time-tested sentencing policy could erode public faith in the judiciary or lead to injustice.“Undue leniency can cause public confidence in the justice system to plummet, while excessive severity may lead to injustice,” ruled a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Augustine George Masih while rejecting a plea for reduction of the eight-year sentence imposed on a youth who, in the heat of the moment during an altercation, struck a blow that led to the death of a man.The accused bore a grudge against a man who had raped his sister. His sister had given birth to a child on account of the sexual assault. The family of the man who raped the girl was unwilling to accede to the proposal to get the rape survivor married to him. The man was in jail on the charge of sexual assault. When the accused, with his family, was visiting the alleged rapist’s family to resolve the issue of his sister’s proposed marriage to him, an altercation broke out, in course of which the alleged rapist’s brother intervened in an effort to calm the situation.But the accused was so enraged by the sexual assault on his sister, coupled with the alleged rapist’s refusal to marry her, that he picked up an axe and gave a fatal blow to the one attempting to pacify the two sides.Senior advocate Rahul Kaushik told the court that the accused was merely 20 years old when the incident happened.Highlighting that the crime was not pre-meditated, he pleaded for leniency in sentence, which had been reduced to eight years by the HC from 10 years imposed by the trial court.Writing the judgment, Justice Datta agreed that the appellant may have been deprived of self-control because of his sister’s alleged rape at the hands of the man. But he found no sudden provocation in the circumstances to warrant the trial court's converting a murder case into a culpable homicide one.",The accused bore a grudge against a man who had raped his sister.

"As live events industry gets bigger, single-window portal soon for clearances",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/as-live-events-industry-gets-bigger-single-window-portal-soon-for-clearances/articleshow/124695073.cms,"NEW DELHI: Organisers of the Hornbill festival in Nagaland to Bihu in Assam, from Ram Leela in North India to Garba nights in Gujarat, musical concerts and cultural performances, among others, will no longer need to seek clearances from multiple authorities. Those organising live events will soon be able to go online to check venue availability, capacity, pre-approved licences, and get clearance within 15 days through a new single-window digital portal being rolled out by the information and broadcasting ministry.This was decided at the joint working group meeting — renamed Live Events Development Cell — this week to make event organisation in India faster, simpler and more transparent.The cell brings together central ministries, nine state govts, leading industry associations and stakeholders under a common framework to streamline permissions, promote creative employment and establish India as a global live entertainment hub. “The portal, expected to go live by Oct-end, will provide end-to-end digital facilitation — from checking available venues and seating capacities to verifying pre-cleared licences and applicable tariffs,” said senior I&B ministry officials, adding that this has been done to remove redundant permissions and overlapping approvals that have long delayed event organisation in the country.The live events industry, valued at over Rs 20,800 crore in FY25, grew 15% in the past year and is projected to double by 2030, according to a white paper, titled ‘India’s Live Events Economy: A Strategic Growth Imperative’, released earlier this year at the WAVES-2025 summit. The sector could generate 15-20 million direct and indirect jobs by 2030, spanning roles in logistics, hospitality, event management, performance and technical services.A model framework is also being prepared by the ministry to serve as a citizen charter, laying out time-bound clearances and grievance redressal mechanisms.The initiative follows PM Narendra Modi’s remarks at the Utkarsh Odisha Summit earlier this year, where he cited the example of international concerts, like Coldplay’s performances in India, as opportunities to harness the country’s growing youth-driven concert culture for economic, employment and cultural growth.The joint working group, chaired by the I&B Secretary, includes representatives from the ministries of culture, sports, skill development, DPIIT, finance, and tourism, as well as govts of Maharashtra, Assam, Delhi, Telangana, Karnataka, and others.","Organisers of live events will soon be able to go online to check venue availability, capacity, pre-approved licences, and get clearance within 15 days.

Parents remove kids from Kerala convent school over hijab curbs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parents-remove-kids-from-kerala-convent-school-over-hijab-curbs/articleshow/124695035.cms,"KOCHI: A convent-run sch-ool’s curbs on wearing the hijab in Kerala’s Kochi have spiralled into a religious and political dispute, with three students seeking transfer certificates and CPI alleging the controversy is being stoked by Sangh Parivar to deepen communal divides.The row began recently when a class 8 student attended St Rita’s Public School in the Kochi neighbourhood of Palluruthy wearing a hijab, which the management said violated its dress code.The girl’s parents complained to CM Pinarayi Vijayan through his grievance redressal forum.An inquiry found the school had violated the student’s right to education. The school maintained it was merely exercising its right to enforce uniform rules. The row widened as two more students — from classes 2 and 3 — applied for transfer certificates Friday, with their parent alleging religious bias by school authorities.Jesna S Firdous, mother of the two students, said Sunday she decided to withdraw her children after seeing how the principal and parent-teacher association president allegedly treated a girl who wore a hijab. She alleged that the school management harboured deep prejudice against other religions and traditions.CPI’s Ernakulam district secretary M Arun alleged that the controversy was being fuelled by a Sangh Parivar agenda to create communal divisions. He claimed some Christian management-run institutions were being used to advance this strategy.","The row began when a class 8 student attended st rita’s public school in the kochi neighbourhood of palluruthy wearing a hijab, which the management said violated its dress code.
