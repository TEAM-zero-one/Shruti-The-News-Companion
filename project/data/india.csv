Mamata Banerjee Warns BJP With Nation-Shaking Threat As SIR Battle Erupts In Bengal Ahead Of Polls

NEW DELHI: The prospect of disruption looms over an already truncated winter session of Parliament as a united opposition on Sunday pressed for a discussion on SIR, an issue that had all but washed out the previous session, as govt remained non-committal to its demand.At an all-party meeting chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh, Congress and a host of other opposition parties also sought debate on several other issues, including national security following the Delhi blast, and rising air pollution, but the nationwide Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls emerged as their rallying point.Ram Gopal Yadav of SP, whose contingent of 37 Lok Sabha members is the second largest in the opposition, sent out an ominous message as the 19-day session covering 15 sitting begins Monday. “We will not allow Parliament to function if a discussion is not held on SIR,” he said, alleging the review of rolls is marred by irregularities and that some booth-level officers ended their lives due to stress. Many SP lawmakers, including him, have been put on “C category” (requiring more documentation), as a targeted segment of voters is being deleted from rolls, he claimed.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju told the opposition that he would get back to them on their demand after consulting key govt functionaries, but gave no assurance.Rijiju had in the last session cited a ruling by then LS Speaker Balram Jakhar in 1988, when Congress was in office, that the House could not debate decisions and functioning of Election Commission to reject opposition’s demand for a discussion on SIR.The opposition’s protest had washed out LS and Rajya Sabha proceedings, except for a discussion on Operation Sindoor, in that session.At Sunday’s meeting, BJP ally and JDU working president Sanjay Jha made light of the opposition's case against SIR by highlighting that its strident stand cut little ice with people in Bihar, the first state where it was carried out, and no voter or political party came forward with any official complaint.In the meeting attended by 50 representatives from 36 parties, govt shared 14 items, including 13 bills, of its tentative agenda and sought the opposition’s support. Rijiju conveyed govt’s keenness on a discussion of Vande Mataram, the national song whose 150th anniversary was observed with much fervour recently by BJP-led NDA.Congress later held a strategy meet of its key leaders with sources saying the party was veering to the stand that the demand for a SIR discussion was non-negotiable.In business advisory meetings of LS and RS, in which govt and opposition functionaries work out Parliament’s agenda, the deadlock remained. Some opposition members, including CPM’s John Brittas, suggested a short-duration discussion on electoral reforms to get around govt’s unwillingness to discuss SIR as the issue can also cover the ongoing exercise in 12 states and UTs.",Opposition pressed for a discussion on special intensive revision of electoral rolls.

NEW DELHI: As a Rs 50,000-crore sword hangs over air travellers at Delhi and Mumbai airports, the Centre has decided to back passengers in an old legal battle between airport operators and the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (AERA), which has now reachedSupreme Court, where the matter will be heard on Dec 3.The case relates to ""hypothetical regulatory asset base (HRAB)"", the capital value of the assets used to calculate the costs of the regulated services, for the first two years of these airports during the PPP era, which started about 20 years ago.After a protracted legal battle followed by the recent Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) judgment, the case has now reached SC, where the two operators of the Delhi and Mumbai airports, DIAL and MIAL, have challenged the tribunal's order striking down theirRs 50,000-crore HRAB claim.""Aviation ministry is going to back AERA in this case as the implications of fares on air travellers are immense. If the private operators of Delhi and Mumbai airports win the case, we are looking at about Rs 50,000 crore getting due to these two operators, which could mean a manifold hike in both user development fees (UDF) paid directly by passengers, and airline landing and parking charges that air carriers factor in while calculating airfares.Overall, the burden for passengers could increase majorly. So, govt has decided to back AERA completely,"" officials said, adding UDF alone could rise by about nine times in Delhi and 21 times in Mumbai.Civil aviation ministry estimates domestic UDF at Delhi could rise from Rs 129 by almost 10 times to Rs 1,261, and at Mumbai from Rs 175 by 22 times to Rs 3,856.In early 2006, Delhi and Mumbai airports were handed over to private players for being developed in PPP (public private partnership) mode. Until then, the state-run Airports Authority of India used to have common charges for all its airports.AERA, which determines tariffs for major airports, came into being in mid-2009. ""The dispute essentially is for the period between the airports being handed over to GMR Group in Delhi and the then GVK Group in Mumbai, and the time when AERA started deciding aeronautical tariffs. If this amount of Rs 50,000 crore becomes due to the developers, the same will be recovered through passengers paying more, and this has to be fought tooth and nail legally. Aviation ministry will do just that,"" said sources.""DIAL and MIAL want a much higher value of assets they got in 2006. What were the assets that time at the two ariports? Run-down terminals barely worth a few hundred crores. They want value of non-aero assets to be added in the regulatory asset base. If that happens and value of non-aero development like hotels, malls and other commercial development is added, the entire model of brownfield airport development will go for a toss as it will come too expensive for users,"" officials said.","Operators dial and mial have challenged a tdsat verdict striking down their hypothetical regulatory asset base (hrab) claim.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Sunday asked Congress to give account of “loot by its leaders” in the National Herald case instead of levelling baseless allegations against the govt after Delhi Police filed an FIR against Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi along with their six other associates and business entities in the matter on an array of criminal charges.BJP’s Ravi Shankar Prasad rejected Congress’s allegation of political vendetta and said the case predates Modi govt. “The nation should know that Young Indian in which Sonia and Rahul own 38% share each, acquired assets worth thousands of crores belonging to AJL, which was held by Congress and owned by National Herald, with only Rs 50 lakh.”“It is clearly a case of loot. The law is taking its course, and Congress should let it,” he said, underlining Congress pleas in HC and SC to get proceedings against its members quashed were rejected and the judiciary asked them to face trial. On the FIR, he said Sonia & Rahul have been slapped with charges of criminal conspiracy and cheating. ED probed the charges, reached a conclusion and now asked police to lodge an FIR.","Bjp mp ravi shankar prasad rejected congress’s allegation of political vendetta.

Can this change? Yes. But it starts young.

What improvement looks like - small, visible acts

A new civic movement is needed



NEW DELHI: Across India, behaviours such as littering, spitting, flouting queues, honking needlessly, encroaching on public spaces, and damaging shared property have become so routine that they often pass without notice.They are not merely behavioural glitches; they are embedded, inherited patterns. The problem is not just policy, enforcement, or infrastructure. It is about mindsets passed quietly from one generation to the next, shaping how we view shared spaces and each other.These visuals are perhaps the way of life for many Indians: a man flinging garbage from his car window; a commuter spitting paan from a moving train; a woman stealing blankets from railway compartments; adults teaching children to urinate on roadsides even when public toilets are nearby.The story of an unruly passenger urinating on a co-passenger aboard an Air India flight shocked the nation. But is it really shocking in a country where public walls are routinely marked with fresh stains of neglect?As Kanchan Yadav puts it, ""Just the other day I wanted to stop a man and ask him to show some basic civic sense instead of casually peeing in the open. But somehow, in this country, people seem far more offended by kissing in public than by pissing in public.Whether you're at a bus stand, outside a shop, or just walking past any public space, the most uncomfortable sight is men relieving themselves anywhere they want. They turn entire corners mushy, filthy and unbearable, assaulting your olfactory like a crime scene. """"We keep calling our country motherland and talk so proudly about Mother Nature, but do we really have the civic sense to keep this 'mother' clean and safe?"" she added.We as a society lack basic civic sense. Why? Is it poor education? Weak enforcement? Overpopulation? A scarcity mindset? Or simply a general belief that public spaces are 'not our problem?'The answer, like the problem, is layered.Much of our public discourse around India’s livability focuses on government action: policy, policing, infrastructure, budgets. But a nation’s quality of life is equally, if not more, defined by its people.Ayush Pandey reflected these sentiments as he narrated an incident from his childhood. ""What I vividly remember from my childhood is travelling in general compartments of trains. Back then, as a four or five-year-old, my mother would sometimes make me urinate out of the train window. At that age, I obviously did not understand the difference between relieving myself in public and using a proper washroom — I only remember it as something done for convenience during travel,"" he said.""As I grew old enough to understand the idea of private versus public spaces, I don’t remember doing it again. Until a certain age, this responsibility lies completely with parents, and I believe many children have experienced similar moments on highways or at railway stations,"" Pandey added.While he admitted that most civic issues emerge from poor infrastructure, Ayush added that many cases are mere examples of laziness. He said, ""Civic sense is not just something expected from adults — it is basic courtesy and awareness. Still, we often see grown men urinating in public without hesitation, as if it is their right instead of walking to the nearest restroom. According to me, many Indians have developed a habit: if they can avoid walking even 200–300 steps, or if a washroom is not easily accessible, they simply look left and right — and relieve themselves in the open. ""A city with spotless streets and smooth traffic can be ruined in days if citizens refuse to cooperate. And yet, even a modest city can become pleasant if its people practice discipline and collective responsibility.Consider this: In just the first three months of this year, the Eastern Railway collected over Rs 32 lakh in fines from people spitting across railway stations in Kolkata. And this is just one zone of one railway system in one part of the country. Imagine the true nationwide scale.Or take another recurring story: passengers stealing railway blankets, pillows, taps, mugs and even fans. These are not acts of poverty-driven desperation. Often, they are simply opportunistic and shameless—small acts that collectively damage India’s reputation and weaken public services.Then there are examples from the other side—moments that feel like a slap of irony. In Gurugram, a group of foreign nationals recently organized a cleanliness drive, clearing roads and drains and urging residents to keep the surroundings outside their homes and shops clean.The sight of foreigners cleaning Indian streets while locals walk by unfazed speaks volumes about our civic apathy.These examples do not mean Indians are inherently careless. Rather, they show what happens when generations grow up without structured civic education, without consistent enforcement, and without cultural emphasis on responsibility for shared spaces.In 1982, Wilson and Kelling proposed the now famous Broken Windows Theory: if a broken window is left unrepaired, it signals that more damage will not cost anything. Disorder invites more disorder.India’s streets are a perfect case study. A clean street invites caution. A dirty street becomes a public dustbin. The moment someone sees a pile of garbage on the curb, the brain goes 'Arre yahan sab phenk rahe hain—main bhi dal deta hoon.'Children observe this too. When they see adults casually littering, they internalise it as 'normal behaviour.' With time, this turns into a collective moral numbness: If the environment is already dirty, what difference will my one wrapper make?This is how individual choices compound into national outcomes.Environmentalist Vimlendu Jha believes the problem lies both at policy and individual level. ""It is a behavioural problem when someone says 'chalta hai' while throwing a wrapper outside their car but the same individual won't do so abroad. Forget America, you will not find litter even in Delhi metro. But you will find the railway station across that metro station dirty, the adjoining streets and markets dirty.""""If littering is naturally coming to me, why is this behavior not showing when I take the metro? Why is the New Delhi Metro Station cleaner than New Delhi Railway station? This talks volumes of both the norms and the laws that are being followed,"" said Jha. ""I don't believe littering is part of our DNA as Indians. We are not dirty by design. We work on convenience, we believe in taking shortcuts when no one is watching and the same Indian behaves differently in another country. ""Generations of Indians have lived in an environment where resources—jobs, seats, houses, promotions, rations—were limited. This created a deeply rooted scarcity mindset: If you don’t rush, push, grab, or seize, someone else will take your seat.This mindset spills into daily behaviour:- pushing into trains before passengers have exited- jostling for space in queues- rushing into elevators without letting people out- honking aggressively- breaking traffic rules, overspeedingEven among the affluent, this scarcity attitude persists. It is not about poverty; it is about conditioning.The result is a society where individual urgency trumps collective order, where personal convenience often matters more than mutual respect.Another major factor is the disconnect between rules and consequences.In India, rules are often seen as suggestions, not obligations. Why? Because breaking them rarely brings consequences.People see influential individuals—politicians, celebrities, senior bureaucrats—violating rules with impunity: driving on the wrong side of the road, avoiding fines, intimidating enforcement authorities, or using privilege to bypass regulations.This teaches the public two dangerous lessons:- Rules apply only to the powerless.-Breaking rules is fine as long as you don’t get caught.Children absorb this quickly. They see their parents bragging about how they avoided a(fine), or how a(hack) helped them bypass a procedure. They learn that bending rules is not just acceptable—it is admired.Thus, a culture develops where accountability is weak, and civic sense becomes optional rather than essential.A fundamental misconception in India is that public spaces belong to the government, not the people.'This is not my property' becomes 'I don’t need to take care of it.'So we litter on beaches, damage train seats, spit on walls, break public taps, vandalise monuments, scribble names on heritage structures—all because we subconsciously feel these spaces belong to nobody (or “the government”), and therefore to everyone in a way that excuses neglect.In Scandinavian countries, Japan, or Singapore, public spaces are treated as collective property—extensions of one’s home. In India, public spaces are treated as expendable.Even the most civic-minded citizen struggles in an environment where infrastructure is inadequate:- garbage bins are scarce- footpaths are encroached- public toilets are dirty- traffic systems are chaotic- drainage systems fail in monsoonsAnother difficult truth: civic sense is tied to how we treat people we consider 'lesser.'Many Indians behave respectfully in five-star hotels, airports, or foreign countries—but act very differently in markets, bus stations, and public offices. Why? Because we treat certain spaces, and certain people, as 'inferior,' not worth respecting.The presence of hierarchies—class, caste, gender—distorts our public behaviour:- yelling at sanitation workers, domestic helpers- ignoring queues when domestic helpers are standing in them- bargaining with vegetable-sellers, autorickshaw drivers- honking at pedestrians as if they are obstaclesWithout equality, civic sense withers.For decades, civic education in India has been treated as a formality — light textbook chapters, boring diagrams, no real-world application. Schools focus on exams, not on building socially responsible citizens. Parents often prioritise grades, not behaviour in public spaces. And children learn most strongly not from books, but from what they see adults do.When a child sees a parent throw garbage on the street, it becomes normal. When a child watches elders jump queues, bribe officials, break traffic rules, talk down to domestic workers, or misuse public property, it creates a blueprint for adulthood.""Environment education should not be treated as a subject to score marks. It is a lifestyle choice at the end of the day with clear implications on our lives and culture. We really need to enforce that value system. Environment education paradigm has to shift from just mere knowledge which is information based vs value and action based,"" said Jha.And these habits persist because public behaviour is contagious. Which brings us to the first root cause.India eradicated diseases like Polio through mass awareness and coordinated action. Civic behaviour can be transformed the same way—with a structured, nation-wide effort involving schools, parents, media, and community institutions.And the most crucial piece of this change is children.Children are still forming values. They observe, absorb, and imitate. If given the right guidance, they can reshape the cultural norms that adults have broken.Schools must treat civic sense not as a textbook chapter but as a core part of learning:- daily cleanliness rituals- community outreach programs- traffic rule workshops- waste segregation practices- field visits to understand sanitation and water management- compulsory social responsibility modulesParents must lead by example:- no littering- following queues- treating workers with dignity- obeying traffic rules- stop flexing 'jugaads' in front of childrenChildren learn civic sense from what they see, not what they are told.Advertisements, influencers, films, and social media campaigns can normalise good behaviour the way they normalise trends. Positive peer pressure works better than moral lectures.When civic sense improves, it won’t happen in grand gestures. It will happen in:- a driver stopping before a zebra crossing- a child refusing to litter- a shopkeeper keeping his storefront clean- neighbours cooperating in waste segregation- a commuter asking another not to spit- a tourist complimenting Indians over discipline- a railway coach that remains clean after a long journeyCivic sense is not theoretical. It’s practical, everyday discipline that builds a collective culture.Today, India stands as one of the largest economies and one of the most influential global powers. Yet, the basics— public cleanliness, traffic discipline, respect for common spaces — lag far behind.If we want to become a truly developed society, civic sense must be reimagined as a moral responsibility, a cultural value, a national priority and a daily habit.We have the ingenuity, the youth power, the technological tools, and the community strength to transform our civic culture. What we need is intention.The responsibility lies with all of usIndia’s lack of civic sense is not an unchangeable flaw. It is the result of years of neglect, inconsistent education, overcrowded cities, poor enforcement, and inherited habits. But every habit can be unlearned. Every culture can evolve. Every generation can do better than the last.Just as we took pride in eradicating Polio, we can take pride in building a cleaner, more respectful, more disciplined India.The responsibility lies with all of us—parents, teachers, leaders, citizens—and especially the children who will inherit this country. Because at the end of the day, a nation is not made great by its government. It is made great by its people.",The story of an unruly passenger urinating on a co-passenger aboard an air india flight shocked the nation. But is it really shocking in a country where public walls are routinely marked with fresh stains of neglect? Is it poor education? Weak enforcement? Overpopulation? Or simply a general belief that public spaces are 'not our problem?',"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125672919,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-970783,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his monthly radio pogramme Mann Ki Baat , on Sunday said the month of November has ""brought a lot of aspirations"" and recalled the major events of which the nation witnessed in the 11th month of the 2025.""India has taken a major step in maintenance, repair, and overhaul in the aviation sector. Last week, INS Mahe was inducted into the Indian Navy in Mumbai. Last week, India's space ecosystem got a new boost with Skyroot's Infinity Campus. All this has become a reflection of Bharat's new ideas, innovation, and youth power.""Addressing the nation during the 128th episode of the Mann Ki Baat, PM Modi lauded a team of young people from Pune, who attempted to fly drones in Mars-like conditions.He said, ""A few days ago, a video on social media caught my attention. It was about a unique drone competition organised by ISRO. In this video, our country's youth, especially our Gen-Z, were attempting to fly drones in Martian-like conditions. In this competition, a team of young people from Pune achieved some success. Their drone even fell and crashed several times, but they did not give up. After several attempts, this team's drone managed to fly for some time in the conditions of Mars.He added that the video reminded him of the setback when Chandrayaan went out of network coverage. Further, the Prime Minister added that the setback was followed by the success of Chandrayaan-3.""This video reminded me of the day Chandrayaan went out of network coverage. That day, the entire country, especially the scientists, was demoralised. But this setback did not deter them. On that very day, they started writing the success story of Chandrayaan-3. The determination of our youth is the greatest strength of Viksit Bharat,"" he said.In 2019, ISRO lost communication with the Vikram lander during the Chandrayaan-2 mission.Mann Ki Baat has served as one of the Prime Minister’s key platforms for connecting with citizens both within India and abroad. PM Modi shares his thoughts on a range of national issues, highlights grassroots initiatives, and encourages public participation in developmental and social campaigns, an approach that has become a hallmark of the programme.The previous episode, aired on October 26, marked the 127th edition of the broadcast. During that address, the Prime Minister extended greetings on the occasion of Chhath Parv and applauded young creators contributing to the revival of Sanskrit. He also celebrated India’s coffee sector gaining greater global recognition.Touching upon public welfare efforts, PM Modi had spoken about the ‘GST Bachat Utsav’, noting the widespread enthusiasm it generated.He highlighted several citizen-driven initiatives promoting cleanliness and sustainability, including the ‘Garbage Café’ in Ambikapur, Chhattisgarh, where meals are offered in exchange for plastic waste, as well as a Bengaluru campaign led by engineer Kapil Sharma to rejuvenate the city’s lakes.The Prime Minister also praised the Border Security Force (BSF) and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) for increasing the presence of Indian-breed dogs in their units, underscoring the country’s growing emphasis on indigenous capabilities.Over the years, Mann Ki Baat has evolved into a significant platform for showcasing inspiring grassroots efforts and promoting civic engagement.Since its launch in October 2014, the programme has played a notable role in raising awareness on issues such as cleanliness, environmental conservation, digital literacy, and women’s empowerment, often catalysing widespread participation and people-driven movements.","Pm narendra modi said the month of november has ""brought a lot of aspirations"" pm modi lauded a team of young people from pune, who attempted to fly drones in mars-like conditions.

‘Not Just Congress’: Tharoor Calls Out RJD Amid NDA’s Big Bihar Lead

NEW DELHI: The Mahagathbandhan on Saturday unanimously elected Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav as the opposition coalition’s leader in the Bihar assembly, a decision taken at the alliance's first meeting since its drubbing in the recent state polls.The meeting was convened by Yadav ahead of the five-day assembly session beginning Monday.RJD MLA Bhai Virendra told reporters, “Tejashwi Yadav has been elected leader of the Mahagathbandhan in the state legislature. Naturally, he will also lead our party in the assembly.”Congress MLC Samir Kumar Singh, a working president of the grand old party’s state unit, noted that the choice was unanimous. “We have sufficient numbers, and he (Tejashwi) will also be the Leader of the Opposition,” he remarked.The Mahagathbandhan was routed in the elections, with the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) retaining power with 202 seats. The RJD-led alliance, which had won 110 seats against the NDA’s 125 in 2020, managed just 35 seats this time — 25 of them from the RJD.Singh added that members of both Houses voiced “concern” over how the elections were conducted. “These were anything but free and fair. The SIR, first carried out in Bihar, remains questionable. It’s no surprise there’s so much political friction in a state like West Bengal,” he observed.He further noted that the alliance would “continue to raise its voice inside the House on issues concerning the people and confront the BJP-led coalition if it backtracks on promises made during the elections.”",Tejashwi yadav is the opposition coalition's leader in the bihar assembly.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India (ECI) has pulled up the West Bengal government for not releasing the increased honorarium for booth level officers (BLOs) and the additional payment approved for the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls.In a statement, the poll body said it had informed an All India Trinamool Congress delegation during a November 28 meeting that the delay in payments was “very strange”.“We told the AITC delegation… that it is very strange that the increased honorarium of Rs 12,000 per year for BLOs and an additional Rs 6,000 to BLOs for SIRs approved by the ECI has not yet been paid by the state government. This should be done without any further delay.”In August, the poll body had doubled the annual remuneration of BLOs from Rs 6,000 to Rs 12,000 and raised the payment for BLO supervisors from Rs 12,000 to Rs 18,000. It also approved an honorarium for electoral registration officers (EROs) and assistant electoral registration officers (AEROs).The Commission said the revision was meant to acknowledge the crucial work of field teams engaged in preparing clean and transparent voter lists.""Pure electoral rolls are the bedrock of democracy. The electoral roll machinery, consisting of EROs, AEROs, BLO Supervisors and BLOs, does a lot of hard work and plays a pivotal role in the preparation of impartial and transparent electoral rolls,"" a press release said.The release added, ""The commission has therefore decided to double the annual remuneration for BLOs & also enhanced the remuneration of BLO Supervisors involved in the preparation and revision of electoral rolls.""Responding to ECI allegations TMC MP Partha Bhowmick said state election commission to reach out to state government. He also hit out at BJP saying Bengal government would give 50,000 to BLOs, but first let 'Bangla birodhi' central government release 2000 crore funds, due to Bengal.""The state commission should talk to state govt or chief secretary on this. Also, BJP that is lecturing - the Central govt should first release the Rs 2000 crore funds, due to Bengal. The AITC govt will pay Rs 50,000 instead of Rs 12,000 to BLOs. But, let 'Bangla Birodhi' govt at Centre first release the Bengal funds they have blocked.""The development comes amid sharp criticism from TMC, whose 10-member MPs’ delegation met chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar on Friday to oppose the SIR exercise being conducted in West Bengal and other states.After the meeting, party MP Derek O’Brien said the delegation handed over a list of nearly 40 people allegedly “dead because of the SIR process”. “We started the meeting by telling him that Mr Kumar and the Election Commission of India have blood on their hands,” he said.The standoff adds to the ongoing friction between the state government and the ECI over electoral roll revisions, with both sides trading charges.(with inputs from agencies)","The election commission of india (eci) has pulled up the west bengal government for not releasing the increased honorarium for booth level officers.

'Doesn’t Deserve LoP Post’: BJP Slams Rahul Gandhi For Missing CJI Surya Kant’s Oath Ceremony

NEW DELHI: The economic offences wing of the Delhi police has registered a fresh FIR against senior Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, along with six other associates and business entities in an alleged case of criminal conspiracy to ""fraudulently"" acquire Associated Journals Ltd, then a Congress held entity having properties worth Rs 2,000 crore. The acquisition was made through Young Indian in which the Gandhis held 76% shareholding.The Delhi police FIR, dated Oct 3, is based on a complaint filed by the Headquarters Investigative Unit (HIU) of the ED, which has shared detailed findings of its investigation into National Herald money laundering case from 2008-2024.Sharing of information under Sec 66(2) of the PMLA allows ED to ask another enforcement agency to register and probe a scheduled offence, which can then become a predicate offence necessary for the ED to carry out its own investigation under the PMLA.The ongoing money laundering probe by ED is based on a private complaint from former BJP MP Subramanian Swamy and its cognisance by metropolitan magistrate's court in Patiala House in June 2014. In this case, the central agency filed a prosecution complaint (chargesheet) under PMLA against Gandhis and other accused on April 9 before a special MPs/MLAs court here at Rouse Avenue. The court has not taken cognisance yet of the matter.Congress has consistently disputed the charges and has accused ED of carrying out a political witchunt at govt's instance. When TOI contacted the party again on Delhi police registering an FIR, it said they are not aware of it.Besides Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, the FIR registered by the Delhi Police has named three others, including chief of Indian Overseas Congress Sam Pitroda. It also names three entities, AJL, Young Indian and the Dotex Merchandise Pvt Ltd, allegedly a Kolkata-based shell company that provided Rs 1 crore to Young India from which Gandhis paid Congress Rs 50 lakh to allegedly acquire AJL with assets allegedly worth Rs 2,000 crore.Sources said the police is likely to summon shareholders of AJL for questioning to ascertain whether the Congress consulted them and took their approval before transferring the company to Young Indian, beneficially owned by Sonia and Rahul Gandhi.",The economic offences wing of the delhi police has registered a fresh fir against senior congress leaders sonia gandhi and rahul gandhi.

Next polls due only in April-May, EC can stretch SIR by a week

NEW DELHI: Election Commission on Sunday extended the timeline for SIR Phase 2 across all 12 states and Union territories, allowing an additional week to booth level officers (BLOs) to share the list of absent, shifted, dead and duplicate electors with booth level agents (BLAs) of political parties prior to publication of the draft electoral roll, so as to ensure full transparency.The enumeration period will now continue till Dec 11 instead of the earlier Dec 4. The draft electoral roll will be published on Dec 16 instead of Dec 9. Claims and objections can be submitted until Jan 15, 2026, and final roll will be out on Feb 14 (Feb 7 earlier).The stretching of all legs of SIR comes amid reports of alleged malpractices in states. Instances include submission of enumeration forms by ineligible persons or illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in the name of dead electors, and login credentials of dead BLOs being misused to upload EFs signed in the name of dead electors.Even though these cases may be limited, there is a view that sharing the list of absent, permanently shifted, dead and duplicate entries with the parties through their BLAs even before the draft rolls are published will allow rival parties an opportunity to object to any incorrect findings. They can also point out attempts to sneak in ineligible persons into the draft roll through impersonation of dead voters.An official said since the next round of assembly polls in five states/UT, including West Bengal, is due only in April-May 2026, the poll authority has time to stretch SIR by a week if it helps ensure a perfect electoral roll.Any errors or anomalies can be corrected in advance, minimising doubts, apprehensions and complaints after the draft rolls are published, the official underlined.Incidentally, the extension in SIR timeline comes even as the enumeration exercise is well on track, with EFs of 84.3% electors across 12 states/UTs collected by far. The EF collection stands at 100% in Lakshadweep, 96.6% in Goa, 95.6% in Rajasthan, 95.2% in West Bengal, 92.7% in Madhya Pradesh, 92.1% in Puducherry, 88.7% in Chhattisgarh, 87.6% in Tamil Nadu, 86% in Gujarat, 83.6% in Andaman & Nicobar, 81.2% in Kerala and 69.5% in UP. EC officials said the progress of work in all five states/UT due for polls in mid-2026, including West Bengal, is satisfactory.As regards UP, they underlined that assembly poll is due there only in mid-2027, giving EC ample scope to extend the timeline further specifically for the state.","Next polls due only in april-may, ec can stretch sir by a week if it helps ensure a perfect electoral roll.

SRINAGAR: J&K chief minister’s Omar Abdullah ’s National Conference (NC) has foregrounded a recently adopted resolution for restoration of special status, seeking to blunt claims that the party has jettisoned a core issue and is cosying up to BJP.Spokesperson Imran Nabi Dar stressed the resolution, passed on Nov 28 at NC’s working committee -- its highest decision-making body --was a message to all that the party’s ideological position remains unchanged.“In the working committee meeting, party legislators stressed that we must not be seen as giving up on our political agenda of restoring the special status under Article 370 . The resolution reaffirms our commitment to special status. It reflects the dominant sentiment within the party,” Dar told TOI.The resolution states that “the working committee unanimously reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to the restoration of J&K’s special status”, adding the issue is central to aspirations and dignity of the people and must be addressed without further delay. “The party will continue its principled fight for its full restoration.”NC also urged the Centre to immediately restore full statehood to J&K, as “promised on the floor of Parliament, repeatedly affirmed in public domain, and noted by Supreme Court”.NC’s manifesto for the 2024 polls had vowed to strive for restoration of “Article 370 and statehood as prior to Aug 5, 2019” -- when the Centre abrogated the special status and turned J&K into a Union territory.On Nov 6 last year, weeks after NC was voted to office, J&K assembly passed a resolution seeking special status. Later, NC was accused by one of its own MPs, Aga Ruhullah Mehdi, and opposition PDP of giving up on Article 370 and concentrating on “restoration of statehood”.Dar said several legislators in the working committee meeting pushed for protests in Delhi to press for statehood, citing difficulties they face at the ground level in getting developmental work executed. But the leadership decided to wait at this stage. “The party expects the Centre to restore statehood as promised in Supreme Court and Parliament,” Dar said.Another NC functionary, Salman Sagar, underscored concerns about attempts to link the party with BJP and the need to counter such narratives firmly.“Central govt and BJP are two different things. As a border state, maintaining a working and cordial relationship with Centre is necessary. But that does not mean we are aligned with BJP. CM (Omar) has made it clear we will never partner with BJP. He reiterated this in the working committee meeting, too. We have decided to challenge any narrative that seeks to portray NC as BJP-friendly. We will fight this narrative war,” Sagar said.","National conference (nc) seeks to blunt claims that the party has jettisoned a core issue and is cosying up to bjp.

‘Full Stop to Many Questions’ Chirag Paswan Hails PM Modi, Nitish as NDA Soars Past 200 Seats

NEW DELHI: Union minister and Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) president Chirag Paswan — whose party is part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) that swept the recent Bihar assembly polls — on Sunday claimed that “several MLAs” from the opposition Mahagathbandhan are in touch with the ruling camp.Paswan made the remark while responding to questions from journalists about speculation that at least four newly elected Congress MLAs — the party won only six seats — are in touch with the Janata Dal (United), led by chief minister Nitish Kumar.“I cannot say about any specific party but many opposition MLAs are in touch with the NDA. They feel that it is only in this coalition, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , that they can serve the people,” he said, according to news agency PTI.The Hajipur MP argued that there is “growing disenchantment” with the opposition, which he accused of doing “nothing constructive” and of ""obstructing"" the government’s functioning.“This has been noticed during every session of the Parliament. We anticipate similar behaviour in the session beginning tomorrow when, incidentally, the session of the state assembly is also going to commence,” Paswan, a former actor, remarked.The winter session of Parliament and a special five-day session of the Bihar assembly — the first since the elections — will begin on Monday. The Parliament session will conclude on December 19.However, Bihar Congress president Rajesh Ram — who himself lost in the recent polls — bristled at the LJP (RV) chief claim.“This has been a narrative that always does the rounds whenever elections are held. We heard similar things in 2020, but all our 19 MLAs remained with the party,” Ram stated.The NDA secured 202 of the assembly’s 243 seats. The BJP emerged as the single largest party with 89 seats, followed by ally JD(U) with 85. The LJP (RV) recorded its best-ever performance, winning 19 of the 28 seats it contested, with two of its MLAs inducted as ministers. Alliance partners Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and Rashtriya Lok Morcha bagged five and four seats, respectively.In contrast, the Mahagathbandhan managed only 35 seats, of which 25 came from its biggest constituent, the Rashtriya Janata Dal.",Lok janshakti party (ram vilas) president chirag paswan claims'several' opposition mlas are in touch with the nda.

People may measure it in AQI or any other form, but I consider it murder. Doctors have said that those living in Delhi in such an environment will see their life expectancy reduced. It is as simple as slowly poisoning somebody to death, and we are all responsible for this crime. ”Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, has also demanded a parliamentary debate on Delhi’s worsening air quality.","Delhi's air quality moves from'very poor' to 'poor' with an aqi of 269 at 7 am.
