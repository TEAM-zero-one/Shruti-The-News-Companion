NEW DELHI: Indian Railways ’ first Vande Bharat sleeper train attracted widespread attention for its modern features and promise of faster overnight travel. However, Indian tourists were quick to prove a lack of civic sense, as a video showing litter on the newly inaugurated train emerged.The high-tech Vande Bharat Sleeper, connecting Howrah and Guwahati, was flagged off on Saturday. A passenger-recorded video from Malda shows plastic packets and spoons scattered across one of the coaches.Sharing the video, X handle @Indianinfoguide wrote, “People litter on vande bharat Sleeper train within hours of its inaugural run. Just see the civic sense.”Several social media users criticised the commuters for their behaviour. One commented, “honestly, this was an expected behaviour from the citizens of India.”Another added, “India doesn’t need enemies. We sabotage ourselves just fine. From breaking rules to trashing infrastructure, from apathy to entitlement, we do more damage internally than any external force could. The real national security threat isn’t always at the border. It’s our collective indifference to the country we live in.”Some users were more casual, with one writing, “Expected !! What’s new here…Wait for orange gutka stamps.”According to the Ministry of Railways, the first commercial run of the Vande Bharat Sleeper between Kamakhya and Howrah saw all tickets sell out within hours of bookings opening.The train’s launch followed the flagging off of India’s first Vande Bharat Sleeper by Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Malda town in West Bengal on January 17. The service aims to make long-distance overnight travel faster and more comfortable while improving connectivity between eastern India and the Northeast.The semi-high-speed, fully air-conditioned train will operate six days a week, except Wednesdays from Kamakhya and Thursdays from Howrah. It will complete the Howrah–Kamakhya journey in about 14 hours, making it the fastest train on the route. Key stops include Malda Town, New Jalpaiguri, New Cooch Behar, and New Alipurduar.The service is expected to significantly benefit passengers travelling between West Bengal and Assam, particularly those undertaking overnight journeys.","Vande bharat sleeper, connecting howrah and guwahati, was flagged off on saturday.

PM Modi Signals Generational Shift As Nitin Nabin Becomes New BJP President, Calls Him His Boss

It may seem to people that Narendra Modi is the third-term PM of the country, he became CM at only 50 years of age and has been head of a govt for 25 continuous years. But above all this in my life is the fact that I am a BJP worker. This is my biggest pride, PM Modi said.He chose the occasion to emphasise the role of BJP’s organisational strength and discipline behind its rise, contrasting this with decline of Congress from the all-time high of over 400 parliamentary seats and nearly 50% votes in 1984 — the largest mandate for any political party — to its current struggle to win even 100 seats.“Congress can never introspect over its decline because it will raise questions over the family which has captured it. They keep looking for excuses. They have lost courage to look for even correct reasons behind their fall,” he said. LoP in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi has repeatedly blamed an alleged collusion of EC and BJP for “vote chori” behind Congress’s string of dismal poll shows.“This family rule is an enemy of democracy,” Modi said and recalled after BJP’s big win in 2002 Gujarat polls, when he was CM, he was at a meeting to review reasons for its loss in some seats.BJP started as a party with a difference and has become the preferred party of governance, he said, in a nod to its “unprecedented” strike rate in recent assembly and civic polls.Raising the issue of infiltration and demographic imbalance, which he had flagged at a recent rally in assembly poll-bound West Bengal, Modi said even rich and strong countries are deporting infiltrators. “The world does not question them for expelling infiltrators,” he said, adding that these nations would claim to be flag-bearers of democracy and act like “nawabs (lords)” of the world. No country accepts infiltrators, he said, without naming any nation. While US has launched an expansive crackdown on infiltrators, several wealthy countries are also tightening measures against them.Asserting that India, too, cannot allow illegals on its soil, he called them a big threat to national security. “We will have to expose parties that are shielding them for vote-bank politics,” he said.In the same breath, he also slammed “urban naxals”, saying they are acquiring international dimensions and conspiring to harm India. They must be defeated by the party’s organisational and ideological strength, he said. Maoism is in its last breath in the country, he said.Modi touched on a host of his govt’s welfare measures and said he is giving an account of his work to the new chief who will write his confidential report, drawing good cheers from the audience.","Modi had previously visited motihari, siwan, madhubani and patna since april.

ED writes to Tamil Nadu govt seeking FIR against minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-writes-to-tamil-nadu-govt-seeking-fir-against-minister/articleshow/126884605.cms,"NEW DEK: Enforcement Directorate ( ED ) has written a letter to the Tamil Nadu govt asking it to register an FIR against municipal administration and water supply (MAWS) minister KN Nehru and take action against corruption in transfer posting of officials in the MAWS dept, while alleging money laundering of Rs 366 crore by the minister and his associates.In the letter, sources said, ED has provided evidence of alleged corruption to the chief secretary and the anti-corruption unit. This is the third time in the last three months that ED has written to the state govt pointing out alleged corruption in municipal administration and made corruption charges against Nehru.The probe agency mentioned that in its earlier letter written to govt on Oct 27 last year, it had brought to its notice the alleged malpractices in the exams and selection process for officers and staff (2024-25, 2025-26) of MAWS dept of Tamil Nadu.Its note had provided purported “evidence of bribes of Rs 25 lakh to Rs 35 lakh being collected from each candidate” and shared details of 150 such candidates, which were seized from a close associate of KN Nehru. Based on this, the agency had sought a probe regarding the appointment of 2,500 candidates.ED had written to the state govt again on Dec 3, alleging “manipulation and corruption” in govt contracts in MAWS dept.It provided additional evidence of purported tender rigging and bribery amounting to 7-15% of contract values.“The present note (letter) deals with evidence relating to corruption in transfer of govt officers/engineers of MAWS by KN Nehru and his associates,” ED is believed to have pointed out.This report, the letter said, also provides direct evidence of money laundering of Rs 365.87 crore by the minister and his family and close associates through various means. The minister had earlier denied all the allegations and termed ED’s actions as being politically motivated.Sources said the agency pointed out in its letter that the bribes were utilised for luxurious lifestyle, creation of personal assets, political expenditure, etc. by its beneficiaries. The proceeds of crime were laundered through the hawala network, both within and outside the country, to keep the identity of ultimate beneficiaries a secret and leave no money trail.The agency claimed that it had seized the evidence during searches at several premises of relatives and associates of KN Nehru across Chennai, Trichy and Coimbatore in April 2025 in connection with its investigation into a bank fraud case based on an FIR registered by CBI-ACB, Chennai.The predicate offence, i.e. the case registered by the CBI-ACB, eventually collapsed after the accused settled their loan which was outstanding with the bank.",Ed has written a letter to the tamil nadu govt asking it to register an fir against municipal administration and water supply (maws) minister kn nehru.

NEW DELHI: Sameer Wankhede — the IRS-Customs officer who left Narcotics Control Bureau under controversial circumstances over a botched up probe in a drug-related case involving Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan ’s son — on Monday got a reprieve from Central Administrative Tribunal, which set aside the disciplinary charges framed against him by his administrative department Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC).Central Administrative Tribunal’s principal bench of chairman Ranjit More allowed Wankhede’s challenge to a Aug 2025 charge memorandum filed against him by CBIC and restrained authorities from taking any disciplinary action as his challenge to the charges against him were subject matter of a case sub-judice before Bombay high court.The bench observed that CBIC must uphold the rule of law as “the chain of events unmistakably demonstrates that the impugned Charge Memorandum bears no real nexus with the purported allegations but appears to be retaliation of respondents arising out of a number of decisions in the matters of the applicant and also is looked as an endeavour to stall the promotion of the applicant”.The CAT’s principal bench noted that “such conduct is ex facie demonstrative of malice in law and personal vendetta and colourable exercise of power”, while warning CBIC of facing a cost for such action unless they “mend their ways” and establish an administrative mechanism that upholds the rule of law.

From party worker to its president: Nitin Nabin becomes BJP's youngest chief — 10 things to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-party-worker-to-president-nitin-nabin-takes-charge-as-youngest-bjp-chief-10-things-to-know/articleshow/126757934.cms,"Nitin Nabin takes charge as BJP chief

Who is Nitin Nabin?

Nitin Nabin is a Bihar cabinet minister who has been elected unopposed to the BJP’s national president post.

He is 45 years old and is the youngest national president of the BJP, surpassing Nitin Gadkari’s record.

Nabin is a five-term MLA from Bankipur in Patna, one of the BJP’s strongest urban constituencies in Bihar.

The new BJP chief currently serves as Public Works Department (PWD) minister in the Bihar government.

His rise in the BJP is closely associated with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership style and organisational inputs from Amit Shah.

He comes from a strong political lineage and is the son of veteran BJP leader Nabin Kishore Sinha , who died in 2006, after which Nabin entered electoral politics.

, who died in 2006, after which Nabin entered electoral politics. Nabin began his political journey through the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and later rose through the BJP’s youth wing.

He has held key organisational roles, including national general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha and BJYM Bihar president (2016–19).

Nabin played a crucial organisational role in BJP’s Chhattisgarh turnaround, accurately predicting the party’s 2023 assembly victory and later overseeing its strong 2024 Lok Sabha performance.

Belonging to the Kayastha community, a numerically small group in Bihar, his elevation underlines the BJP leadership’s preference for organisational ability over caste arithmetic.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Nitin Nabin on Tuesday assumed charge as the party's new national president, marking a key transition in the ruling party's organisational leadership.The swearing-in ceremony was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with several senior party leaders. BJP chief ministers, national office-bearers, state unit presidents and members of the party’s national executive were also present at the event held in the national capital.The ruling party on Monday declared Nabin as its sole candidate for the post after the nomination and scrutiny process concluded without any rival contenders. This cleared the path for his unopposed election as the party’s 12th national president.In a late-night statement, BJP National Returning Officer K. Laxman said that only Nabin’s name remained after the completion of nominations and the withdrawal window, confirming his election by consensus.After assuming the position, Nitin Nabin said the moment is ""a moment of resolve"" for him and expressed heartfelt gratitude to the Prime Minister.""Today, I am not just assuming a position. I am accepting the ideology, traditions, and the responsibility of a nationalist movement of this party, and on this occasion, I also pay my respects to all my senior colleagues...Today, 140 crore Indians are connecting themselves with the dream of a developed India and are working to take the country forward,"" Nitin Nabin said in his first address after taking charge as the BJP chief.“When it is about the party, Nitin Nabin is my boss,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, calling himself a “party worker” of the BJP.Addressing the gathering after the inauguration of Nitin Nabin as the BJP's youngest-ever national president, PM Modi said: “When it is about the party, Nitin Nabin is my boss.”The Prime Minister also highlighted new party chief's age, saying, “…Nitin Nabin ji will carry forward the legacy of the BJP. To put it in the language of today’s youth, Nitin ji himself is, in a way, a millennial.”Elaborating further, PM Modi said, “The next 25 years are very important. This is the period when a developed India is to be built, and it is destined to happen. At the beginning of this crucial period, our Nitin Nabin ji will carry forward the legacy of the BJP.Ahead of the formal assumption of office, the BJP headquarters in New Delhi wore a festive look on Tuesday morning. Nabin began the day by offering prayers at the Jhandewalan Temple and later visited the Hanuman Mandir in Connaught Place.Reacting to his elevation, BJP MP Manan Kumar Mishra said the party’s decision reflected its intent to promote younger leadership while relying on experience.“The party has taken a resolve to give space to young leadership. He is young and also quite social. He has a lot of experience. Our party is the largest party in the world. Under his leadership, even better work will be done,” Mishra told reporters.Nabin has been serving as the party’s working national president prior to this elevation.","Nitin nabin is a bihar cabinet minister who has been elected unopposed to the bjp’s national president post.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu governor RN Ravi walked out of the state assembly on Tuesday before delivering his inaugural address, expressing disappointment over what he said was a lack of respect for the national anthem . He also claimed that his microphone was switched off during the proceedings.“I am disappointed. National Anthem was not given due respect,” the governor said. He added that “it is unfortunate that his speech was interrupted.”Inside the House, the situation led to a sharp exchange, with assembly Speaker M Appavu urging the governor to follow established rules and customs of the assembly.Later, Raj Bhavan issued a press release explaining the reasons behind the governor’s walkout. “The governor’s mic was repeatedly switched off, and he was not allowed to speak,” the statement said. It also claimed that issues such as “atrocities against Dalits and sexual violence against Dalit women are sharply increasing,” but were “totally bypassed in the speech.”The release further alleged that the “National Anthem is yet again insulted, and the Fundamental Constitutional Duty is disregarded.”Meanwhile, AIADMK general secretary and leader of opposition in assembly Edappadi Palaniswamy raised slogans with party leaders at the entrance of assembly after they walked out from the House over law and order issues in Tamil Nadu.This was not the first such incident. A similar episode took place last year when governor Ravi walked out of the Assembly in what he described as “deep anguish,” alleging that the “constitution of Bharat” and the National Anthem were insulted.With Assembly elections drawing closer, the session is being viewed as politically crucial. Opposition parties, including the AIADMK and the BJP, are expected to level several allegations against the ruling party and the state government.Chief minister M K Stalin and his Cabinet colleagues are preparing to counter the attacks, setting the stage for a tense and politically charged assembly session.",Tamil nadu governor rn ravi walked out of the state assembly on tuesday before delivering his inaugural address.

Nabin’s rise in BJP

NEW DELHI: Nitin Nabin , who formally took charge as the national president of the Bharatiya Janata Party today, has his task cut out for him. His immediate challenge are the assembly elections in Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.The BJP has a lot at stake in this round of elections as it defends its government in Assam and Puducherry and goes all-out to wrest power from Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress in West Bengal. In Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the BJP is trying hard to expand its base.2027 will be another busy year electorally for the BJP president as seven states, including Uttar Pradesh, will vote to elect new assemblies. The other six are: Gujarat, Goa, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Himachal and Manipur.Chhattisgarh, a state which played a key role in giving prominence to Nitin Nabin, will vote in 2028 along with eight other states - Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana, Karnataka, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura and Meghalaya. Nitin Nabin was the party in charge in Chhattisgarh in the 2022 assembly elections and the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.And finally, 2029 will see the BJP under Nitin Nabin go all out for a record fourth consecutive victory in the general elections.The five-time Bihar MLA, who is widely recognised for his organisational acumen and administrative experience, will play a key role in anchoring the BJP's election efforts.More than the opposition parties, his toughest competition will come from his predecessors in the party who have led the party to great electoral successes since 2014.With coalitions becoming an integral part of today’s politics, Nitin Nabin will also have to play an important role in working with the party’s regional allies in different states.The appointment of 45-year-old Nitin marks a generational shift in the BJP’s leadership role and has been hailed by all the party leaders. However, for Nitin Nabin, this comes as a challenge as he faces the difficult task of managing the many senior leaders who have decades of experience and some of whom were hopeful of getting the coveted top BJP post.While on the one hand he would want to use their experience to the hilt, on the other hand he would have to ensure to keep them all in good humour for the smooth functioning of the party.For Nitin Nabin, the youth and Gen Z outreach will be both personal and political. Nabin has become the first millennial born post-Emergency president of the BJP.Thus, he must make fresh attempts to connect with Gen Z voters born after 1997, a voter base critical in upcoming assembly elections. This outreach will also test whether the BJP’s ""25-year vision"" resonates with young voters to be converted into election polls or not.Soon after assuming the party president post, he appealed to the youth to enter politics to fulfil PM Modi 's resolve of making India developed.""On August 15, 2025, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called upon the country's youth to enter public life. I want to ask the country's youth that keeping distance from politics is not the solution but making active contributions,"" he said.""At the same time, I would also like to point out to the youths that there is no shortcut in politics. Politics is not a 100-metre race but a marathon where one's stamina and not speed is tested. Come forward and let's work on this political pitch keeping our roots strong,"" he added.In his address after taking charge, Nabin said that this day is ""a moment of resolve"" for him, as he is not just assuming a post but also the ""ideology, traditions, and the responsibility of a nationalist movement of the party"".""We are associated with such a political party, where politics is not power, it is spiritual practice, not indulgence, but sacrifice. It is not luxury and comfort, it is austerity. Politics is not a position of authority, it is responsibility,"" Nabin said.He asked party leaders and workers to make an all-out effort to ensure the BJP's success in the upcoming assembly polls in five states, including West Bengal, to protect the ""Sanatan traditions and faith"" and the country from demographic changes.PM Modi led the party in congratulating Nitin Nabin and said, ""To put it in the language of today's youth, Nitin ji himself is, in a way, a millennial."" He elaborated that 45-year-old Nabin belongs to a generation that has witnessed major economic, social and technological transformations, saying, ""He belongs to the generation that received information from the radio in their childhood and is now an active user of AI. ""Highlighting the importance of the coming decades, PM Modi said, ""The next 25 years are very important. This is the period when a developed India is to be built, and it is destined to happen."" He expressed confidence that Nitin Nabin would carry forward the party's legacy, adding, ""At the beginning of this crucial period, our Nitin Nabin ji will carry forward the legacy of the BJP.""Stressing on Nabin’s important role ahead, PM Modi said: ""When it is about the party, Nitin Nabin is the boss, and I am a party worker. Now Honourable Nitin Nabin ji is the president of all of us, and his responsibility is not just to manage the BJP, but also to ensure coordination among all NDA allies.""However, the Congress was quick to mock the BJP’s election process. The ruling party announced the president first and then stated that there would be an election, but there was none, the Congress said.The opposition party also took a dig at Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar, saying he is unhappy as he did not get anything to ""manipulate"" in this process.""Gyanesh Kumar wants to resign in protest; he has no role, he can't even influence, he can't even manipulate anything,"" the Congress' media and publicity department head, Pawan Khera, said while targeting the CEC, whom the opposition party has been attacking over alleged irregularities in elections.Congress MP Manickam Tagore claimed that key decisions in the BJP are taken only by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah .""There is no democracy in the BJP, only HM Amit Shah and PM Modi take the decisions, and they have proved it again... What is the work of the returning officer when there is no election? We hold elections in Congress, and Mallikarjun Kharge and Shashi Tharoor were candidates, and voting took place. This is called democracy. PM Modi and Amit Shah want to take over the role of all the workers... BJP is an authoritative party and moving towards dictatorship,"" he said.Congress ally Rashtriya Janata Dal also criticised the BJP, with MP Manoj Jha saying, ""Don’t call it an election... an election is only called when there are two or more choices. Nevertheless, he has become the national president, and I extend my best wishes to him.""Born on May 23, 1980, in Jharkhand's Ranchi, Nabin entered electoral politics at a young age and was first elected to the Bihar legislative assembly in 2006 from the Patna West Assembly constituency. Since 2010, Nabin has been elected from the Bankipur assembly constituency in 2010, 2015, 2020, and 2025, thereby becoming a five-time MLA. He has held key portfolios like road construction, urban development & housing and law in the Bihar government as a cabinet minister.Nabin’s soft demeanour, which may have played a key role in his elevation as BJP president, will be put to the ultimate test as he navigates the complexities of his new role.","Nitin nabin formally took charge as the national president of the bharatiya janata party today. His immediate challenge is the assembly elections in assam, west bengal, kerala, tamil nadu and puducherry. The appointment of 45-year-old nitin marks a generational shift in the bjp’s leadership role.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126819173,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-947951,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

The elimination of bonds as an anonymous source of political funding by corporates corresponded with a nearly three-fold rise in donations from companies and organisations declared by BJP in its annual audit report for 2024-25. As per the report filed with EC, corporate donations to BJP rose to Rs 5,422 crore from Rs 1,885 crore in 2023-24.Congress, in its 2024-25 annual audit report filed earlier, had declared a total income of Rs 918 crore and expenditure of Rs 1,112 crore.The main opposition party's receipts via grants, donations and contributions saw a nearly 54% dip to Rs 522 crore from Rs 1,130 crore in 2023-24. This may be on account of the elimination of bonds, considering Congress had raised almost Rs 828 crore through this route in 2023-24.Individual donors contributed Rs 641 crore to BJP in the last fiscal, up from Rs 240 crore in 2023-24.Of the total Rs 6,769 crore income declared by BJP in its annual audit report for 2024-25 - up from Rs 4,340 crore declared in 2023-24 - Rs 6,125 crore came from voluntary contributions, Rs 634 crore as interest from banks, Rs 5.7 crore as fees and subscriptions and Rs 4.5 crore as 'other income'.On the expenditure side, BJP spent a total of Rs 3,775 crore in 2024-25, of which Rs 3,335 crore was for election propaganda. This is almost double the Rs 1,754 crore it had spent under the same head in 2023-24. Congress election expenditure in 2024-25 stood at Rs 896 crore, up from Rs 620 crore in 2023-24.Electronic media publicity saw the highest spend by BJP in the last financial year, touching almost Rs 1,125 crore compared to Rs 435 crore in 2023-24.Hoardings cost the BJP nearly Rs 107 crore; air travel, Rs 583 crore; and financial assistance to candidates, Rs 313 crore. Another Rs 91 crore was spent on morchas and rallies, while meeting expenses amounted to nearly Rs 52 crore.Having started 2024-25 with a general fund opening balance of Rs 9,170 crore, BJP ended the year with a surplus of Rs 2,995 crore, which made for a closing balance of Rs 12,164 crore.","Voluntary contributions received by bjp in 2024-25 rose almost 54% to rs 6,125 crore.

""Noting that the number of matrimonial litigation has gone up several-fold in recent years, the court said family members should intervene to settle the dispute before it reaches the court.""Even this court is flooded with transfer petitions, mainly filed by wives, seeking transfer of the proceedings initiated by their husbands, may be at the first instance or as a counter blast. In such situations, it is the duty of all concerned including the family members of the parties to make their earnest effort to resolve the dispute before any civil or criminal proceedings are launched.""

The judges said public safety must come first, especially in places like schools, hospitals, and railway stations.They also said people who feed stray dogs should act responsibly. The court questioned who would be held responsible if a dog attacks someone and said that those who want to care for dogs should keep them as licensed pets rather than letting them roam freely.Last year, the SC had directed that stray dogs be removed from the premises of educational institutions, hospitals, and bus and railway stations, and ruled that they should not be returned to the same areas after sterilisation.Maneka had criticised this order saying: ""This is as bad as or even worse than Justice Pardiwala's judgement. This cannot be put into practice...If 5000 dogs are removed, where will you keep them? You need 50 shelters...But you do not have that. You need people to pick them up.

'We Are United...Will Go To Delhi If High Command Calls': Siddaramaiah, Shivakumar After Meeting

NEW DELHI: The ongoing tension over the Karnataka chief minister 's post resurfaced on Tuesday after DK Shivakumar ’s brother said Rahul Gandhi had assured the deputy chief minister that a decision would be taken at an appropriate time.Former MP DK Suresh described Shivakumar as a committed party functionary and said the Congress leadership, including Gandhi, had asked him to exercise restraint while assuring him that the matter would be resolved in due course.“The party has already asked him to be patient. Rahul Gandhi, during the meeting in Mysuru, also said that an appropriate decision would be taken at the right time,"" news agency PTI reported him as saying.He also said that Shivakumar’s approach was guided by the need to keep all 140 Congress legislators together and maintain stability in the government. Emphasising that political authority requires perseverance, he added, “In the interest of the party and legislators, and with the goal of keeping all 140 legislators together, he is patiently waiting for the party’s decision.”With an eye on the 2028 assembly elections, Suresh also stressed that unity within the Congress would be critical.“He is also the party president and should maintain discipline first, which he is following diligently,"" he said refering to Shivakumar.The leadership churn in Karnataka intensified after the Congress government completed the halfway mark of its five-year term on November 20, 2025. The speculation centres on a reported power-sharing understanding between Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar at the time of government formation in 2023. Shivakumar has previously said discussions on the issue were held with the Congress high command and that while a decision had been taken, its timing is yet to be finalised.Suresh indicated that the upcoming legislative session, scheduled from January 22 to 31, could be a reference point, after which the party leadership’s stand may become clearer.Meanwhile, chief minister Siddaramaiah said he would travel to New Delhi if called by the Congress high command to discuss the leadership issue. He reiterated that any such engagement would depend on a formal summons from the party leadership. ""I will go if I am called by the Congress high command,"" he said.Siddaramaiah also sought to shift focus to governance, noting that the joint session of the state legislature would be held from January 22 to 31, alongside a special session on MGNREGA. He said preparations for the 2026–27 state budget would begin after the session, with official ANI sources indicating that the budget is likely to be presented in March.

Whenever my daughter travelled in India, she was left deeply bewildered—why people spoke to her while staring at her chest instead of meeting her eyes, why they asked for selfies as if she were an object rather than a person, and why so many felt entitled to touch, feel, or grab her. The experience was confusing, unsettling, and profoundly violating.""Another said, ""Most unfortunate.

NEW DELHI: In his maiden address after taking over as BJP national president, Nitin Nabin on Tuesday asked party workers to mount a fight to “protect” the centres and legacy of Sanatan faith, saying political parties opposed to ‘deepam’ tradition in Madurai or existence of Ram Setu should have no space in politics.Nabin, whose elevation at 45 years of age is being seen as a generational shift in BJP, called Prime Minister Narendra Modi an inspiration and urged the youth to heed his call for joining active politics by saying “keeping a distance is no solution”. Youth should treat politics as a marathon and not a 100-metre sprint and prioritise stamina over speed, he said, adding that BJP’s “watch tower” is vigilant enough to identify their talent.Nabin’s unopposed election as the 12th BJP president was announced at a function at the party headquarters in New Delhi in the presence of PM Modi and several former party chiefs, including JP Nadda, Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadkari.Shah congratulated Nabin, expressing confidence that his tenure as BJP president under Modi’s guidance will infuse new energy and speed in the party’s dedicated work towards national interest and people’s welfare.The fifth-term MLA and first person from Bihar to head BJP’s organisation ticked off the party’s twin planks of Hindutva and nationalism in his inaugural address, which will be pored over by its rank and file, a large number of whom might not have heard much of him before he was appointed BJP working president last month. DMK ’s strident opposition to bid by Hindu groups to light a ‘deepam’ at a hilltop considered sacred by them was seized by BJP to mount a political challenge as the state heads to assembly polls.Nabin also flagged the decision by DMK and its allies to move a motion for removal of Madras high court Judge GR Swaminathan, who had decided in favour of Hindu groups, to target the parties. A division bench had later rejected state govt’s challenge to the verdict. He also voiced the party’s concerns over infiltration, which is a key part of its agenda in poll-bound Bengal and Assam.","Nitin nabin, 45, is the 12th bjp president.
