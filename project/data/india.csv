NEW DELHI: Members of a parliamentary committee on Wednesday debated whether opposition parties, which have refused joining their panel formed to study a bill aimed at ""decriminalisation"" of politics, should be invited to offer their views on the proposed law and if the leader of opposition can be removed from office under its provisions.Law Commission of India chairperson Dinesh Maheshwari was among the key figures who shared their views with the Joint Committee of Parliament scrutinising the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill and two related bills, which seek removal from office of PM, CMs and ministers if they are under arrest for 30 days and more on serious criminal charges.A BJP MP, sources said, flagged a scenario when the governing party refuses to name the replacement for PM and CMs in case they are removed from office due to their detention and said amendments should be made to plug this loophole to rule out such a possibility that can cripple governance, especially in times of crisis in the country or a state.If such a case arises, then the president of the country or the governor of a state should be legally empowered to use their discretion if a replacement of the arrested head of govt is not forthcoming, he suggested.Congress and most other opposition parties have refused to join the committee, which is headed by BJP's Aparajita Sarangi, as they have slammed the bill as unconstitutional and politically motivated.The committee has only two MPs from the opposition among its members-Supriya Sule of NCP(SP) and AIMIM's Asaduddin Owaisi.When one of them suggested that opposition parties should be invited to offer their views on the bill, several MPs questioned the proposal noting that they had ignored repeated suggestions by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to join the panel.Some members also wondered if the leader of opposition can be removed from office under the bill's provisions.Though the two LoPs in Parliament, and LoPs in state assemblies enjoy certain govt protocols, they are not considered part of the executive and are not covered under the current provisions of the bill.Sources said Maheshwari and Hyderabad-based National Academy of Legal Studies and Research's VC Sri Krishna Deva Rao agreed with the idea behind the bill's aim for decriminalisation of politics amid several suggestions made by them and committee's members.",Law commission of india chairperson dinesh maheshwari was among the key figures who shared their views with the joint committee of parliament scrutinising the constitution (130th amendment) bill.

'Believed shrine revamp harmed India's image': BJP cites letters by Nehru to accuse him of 'hating' Somnath temple deity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/believed-shrine-revamp-harmed-indias-image-bjp-cites-letters-by-nehru-to-accuse-him-of-hating-somnath-temple-deity/articleshow/126404662.cms,"NEW DELHI/ RAJKOT: Ahead of the launch of year-long ""Somnath Swabhiman Parv"" by PM Narendra Modi on Jan 11, BJP on Wednesday launched a fresh attack on Congress for its govt's opposition to the reconstruction of the revered temple and flagged letters written by Jawaharlal Nehru to accuse him of ""hating"" the deity.BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said Nehru believed the temple's reconstruction and association of Congress stalwarts like Rajendra Prasad, then President, harmed India's global image and said the opposition party continued to follow a similar distaste for the country's Hindu heritage.At a press conference in Delhi, Trivedi said the first PM addressed his Pakistani counterpart Liaquat Ali Khan as ""my dear nawabzada"" to protest false reports in that country over the temple's construction instead of defending India's civilisational memory.He also wrote to India's ambassador in China to play down its significance apparently to minimise any adverse reaction from Mao Zedong, the Rajya Sabha MP said, alleging that he pursued ""blind appeasement politics by repeatedly emphasising his opposition to then President Rajendra Prasad's association with its inauguration. ""Our opposition to Nehru is not personal but on principles. His letters underline how scary and dangerous his ideas were.We are not tarnishing his image. We are merely unmasking it as Congress continues to follow the same principle,"" BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said.Modi will offer prayers at the temple and pay tributes at the statue of Sardar Patel outside its precincts. He is also scheduled to attend a roadshow and Shaurya Yatra, dedicated to those who laid down their lives defending the temple from invaders, and address a large public gathering.""The year marks 1,000 years since Mahmud Ghazni's attack on the Somnath temple in 1026 AD, while also completing 75 years of Sardar Patel's historic resolve to rebuild the shrine. To mark this rare convergence, the festival has been planned to honour Somnath's legacy of resilience and valour,"" Gujarat minister Jitu Vaghani said. Highlighting the key attractions of the festival, the Gujarat minister said a mega drone show featuring 3,000 drones - the largest of its kind - will depict the history and grandeur of Somnath in the night sky.Prime Minister Modi's visit on Jan 11, which marks 1,000 years of the temple's destruction by Mahmud Ghazni, and his projection of its revival as a tribute to India's cultural resilience coupled with Nehru's wariness of the revered temple's rebuilding have provided a fresh ballast to BJP's campaign to paint Congress as indifferent if not outrightly hostile to the country's Hindu heritage but being rather sensitive to interests of minorities, especially Muslims.Nehru wrote over 17 letters to question the need for Somnath temple's reconstruction, including to the then president, vice president, cabinet ministers and chief ministers, and asked public broadcasters to minimise its coverage.He said Nehru prioritised ""external appeasement over internal self-confidence"". ""Somnath was plundered by Mahmud Ghazni and Khilji in the past, but in independent India, Pandit Nehru harboured the greatest hatred towards Lord Somnath,"" he alleged.","Bjp launches fresh attack on congress for its opposition to the reconstruction of the revered temple.

Varma: Jt probe panel needed for removal motion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/varma-jt-probe-panel-needed-for-removal-motion-sc-disagrees-with-justice-varmas-stand-on-rs-notice/articleshow/126404603.cms,"SC disagrees with Justice Varma over RS notice



NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday asked Justice Yashwant Varma, facing a removal motion in the Lok Sabha, how he was prejudiced by the Speaker constituting a panel to inquire into the charges of cash being found at his residence as he pleaded that it should have been done in consultation with the Rajya Sabha chairman.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said that as per the Judges Inquiry Act, 1968, if the motion for removal is presented in both Houses on the same day, the inquiry committee was to be constituted jointly by the Speaker and the Chairman. However, the Speaker unilaterally constituted the panel. tnnRohatgi, aided by senior advocates Sidharth Luthra and Sidharth Agarwal, argued on behalf of Justice Varma for little over an hour raising three issues - that then RS Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar had found the motion moved by more than 50 MPs in the Upper House to be in order, RS deputy chairperson had no authority to reject the motion on Aug 11, and that the inquiry committee should have been constituted jointly.The bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Satish Chandra Sharma said it prima facie disagreed with the arguments on two points and posted the hearing for Thursday to hear Rohatgi on how the constitution of the inquiry committee by the LS Speaker vitiated the process.Responding to Justice Varma's charge that the law stipulated only the RS Chair to admit or reject a notice for removal motion, solicitor general Tushar Mehta was able to convince the court that when the post of Chairperson was vacant, which was when Dhankar resigned on July 21 hours after receiving the removal motion, the deputy chairperson is constitutionally capable of discharging all the duties.He said the RS Chairman had neither scrutinised the motion nor taken a decision to admit it as is being wrongly projected by Justice Varma. ""The secretary general of RS undertook scrutiny of the motion presented by 62 MPs and notice of the motion was presented before the RS deputy chairperson along with the report of the secretary general showing that the motion was defective on many counts,"" he said.In any case, the very purpose of the MPs who moved the motion in RS was to initiate proceedings under section 3 of the Act for removal of Justice Varma, which is fully satisfied due to admission of similar motion by the LS Speaker, Mehta said.On Justice Varma's plea that reference to the CJI-constituted in-house committee, which found him liable, in the Speaker's order has rendered the inquiry biased against him, the LS secretariat in its affidavit said the Speaker merely mentioned the in-house inquiry report and it would not be correct to say that the Speaker had relied on it.The Speaker-constituted inquiry panel headed by Justice Aravind Kumar has already supplied to Justice Varma the memo of charges along with the evidence, mainly comprising of the videos of the burning cash recorded by Delhi Police and Delhi Fire Service personnel on the night of March 14-15 while dousing a fire in a room inside the judge's Lutyens Zone bungalow.It has permitted Justice Varma to respond to the charges by Jan-end.",Sc disagrees with justice varma over rs notice for removal motion.

"NMC charges Rs 2 lakh one-time fee for colleges to hike MBBS seats, PG intake up 450 so far",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nmc-charges-rs-2-lakh-one-time-fee-for-colleges-to-hike-mbbs-seats-pg-intake-up-450-so-far/articleshow/126404591.cms,"NEW DELHI: The National Medical Commission has so far cleared around 450 additional postgraduate (PG) medical seats for the 2025–26 academic year through the appeal process. It has also introduced a non-refundable one-time registration fee of Rs 2 lakh plus 18% GST and removed the earlier cap that limited applications for an increase of up to 100 MBBS seats at a time.On PG admissions, Dr M K Ramesh, president of Medical Assessment and Rating Board, told TOI, PG seat approvals by the first appeal committee are cumulative and ongoing. While earlier notices cited 171 and later 262 additional seats, the total cleared through appeals so far is around 450, with further additions possible.The additional PG seats — mostly incremental increases of one to four seats per programme— span high-demand specialties, including general medicine, radiodiagnosis, dermatology, paediatrics, orthopaedics, obstetrics and gynaecology, psychiatry and general surgery, across medical colleges. Most of these seats have gone to private medical colleges, though some govt institutions are also included, as per the available list.MARB has directed counselling authorities to include the newly sanctioned PG seats without waiting for individual Letters of Permission (LoPs), treating the consolidated list uploaded on the NMC website as a valid document for counselling. Officials said publishing consolidated appeal approvals online was introduced to speed up admissions and improve transparency.Separately, NMC has introduced a non-refundable one-time registration fee of Rs 2 lakh plus 18% GST for institutions seeking to start new MBBS colleges or increase undergraduate seats from the 2026–27 academic year. Explaining the move, Dr Ramesh said the fee is aimed at ensuring serious intent and accountability, stressing that establishing a medical college cannot be treated as a routine business decision. He said the registration fee is separate from the existing application fee of Rs 5 lakh for 50 MBBS seats, which rises with higher intake, and only partly offsets the cost of inspections, including travel and stay for three to five assessors conducting multi-day assessments.On MBBS expansion, Dr Ramesh said the earlier cap allowing applications for a maximum increase of 100 MBBS seats at a time was withdrawn because it had no explicit backing in existing regulations and could not be legally sustained.","The national medical commission has so far cleared around 450 additional postgraduate (pg) medical seats for the 2025–26 academic year through the appeal process.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday backed the use of electric vehicles as Delhi continues to battle air pollution. The apex court said that car ownership has turned into a status symbol and urging greater responsibility from rricher sections of society.Hearing a plea related to air pollution, CJI Surya Kant remarked that personal transport choices were contributing significantly to the crisis.“Car has become a status symbol… People are saving money to buy cars and have stopped using cycles,” the CJI said, as reported by PTI.The CJI said, “The rich people should also sacrifice. Instead of going for high-end vehicles, they should go for good electric vehicles.”Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing in the matter, argued that curbing the ownership of multiple vehicles could be one way forward, while also pointing out that the automobile industry wielded considerable influence.The court also came down heavily on the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), describing it as “failing in its duty” after it sought a two-month adjournment on the issue of temporarily closing or relocating toll plazas at Delhi borders to ease congestion. The bench criticised the authority for a lack of urgency and seriousness in dealing with the pollution emergency.“Have you been able to identify the causes of pollution? … By holding a meeting on January 2 and telling us that we will come after two months, that is not acceptable to us.

JAMMU: A gun battle broke out between security forces and terrorists in the forests in the upper reaches of Billawar, in J&K’s Kathua district, on Wednesday, where a group of two-three ultras was suspected to be hiding. Around 4pm that evening, locals had reported spotting a terror suspect in Kamad Nallah area.“On being alerted, a joint team of security forces, including SOG Kathua and CRPF personnel, rushed to the area and launched a massive search operation. Holed-up terrorists opened fire at the search party, triggering an encounter. As the firefight erupted, the ultras ran into the forest,” an official said.IGP (Jammu Zone) Bhim Sen Tuti, in an X post, stated that the troops were relentlessly engaging the terrorists despite “darkness, thick vegetation and treacherous terrain”. Officials said the area had been cordoned off. The operation remained in progress till late Wednesday.Earlier this month, a village defence guard (VDG) fired warning shots in the air on Jan 2, upon observing suspicious movement near his house in Dessa village, Doda district, following which security forces launched an anti-terror operation in the area. On Dec 31, 2025, a similar operation was carried out in Dali village in Rajouri district’s Kalakote area based on a VDG’s report about suspicious movement.A string of counter-terror operations has been underway in the upper reaches of Doda, Kishtwar and Ramban districts in Chenab region, and the border areas along Udhampur and Kathua districts, to track and kill ultras on the move. Such operations were also continuing in the two frontier districts of Rajouri and Poonch, and Reasi district, which shares a border with Rajouri-Ramban in Jammu division and Kulgam in south Kashmir.","A gun battle broke out between security forces and terrorists in the forests in the upper reaches of billawar, in j&k’s kathua district, on wednesday.

"Medical college row: Omar says Jammu’s loss, blames protesters for ‘destroying’ students’ future; BJP & Hindu groups celebrate",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/medical-college-row-omar-says-jammus-loss-blames-protesters-for-destroying-students-future-bjp-hindu-groups-celebrate/articleshow/126401866.cms,"SRINAGAR: BJP and Hindu groups on Wednesday celebrated the National Medical Commission’s decision to withdraw permission to Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence (SMVDIME) in Reasi, Jammu, to run an MBBS course from 2025-26 academic session, while J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah reacted sharply, accusing them of playing with the future of students.As activists of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Sangharsh Samiti — a conglomerate of Hindu social and religious organisations that led an agitation against the admission of non-Hindu students to the shrine board-run medical college — held victory marches in Jammu, burst crackers and danced, Omar on Wednesday evening said it was unfortunate that people were celebrating the “closure of a medical college”. “In other parts of the country people fight to get such institutions,” he said. “If you are happy to destroy the future of our children, then go ahead and burst crackers.”The Sangharsh Samiti had been protesting since Nov against the admission of 42 Muslim students, mostly from Kashmir, in the first batch of 50, with only seven Hindus and one Sikh among the selected candidates. Its contention was that an institution funded by Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board should give preference to Hindu students and those who have faith in Mata Vaishno Devi.CM Omar said within two years, the institute’s intake capacity would have risen to 400, of which about 250 would have come from Jammu. “Now, no one will get those seats because the college has been closed in the name of religion,” he said. Students who fail to secure admission in medical colleges in future should remember the role played by the Sangharsh Samiti in closing this institute, he added.On Tuesday, barely an hour before the NMC order, the CM had said the medical college was not worth running given the religious politics played around it, and had suggested shutting it down. “In the given scenario, I don’t feel the students themselves would like to study there. We request GoI and the health ministry to adjust these children in other colleges. Had I been a parent of these students, I wouldn’t send them there,” Omar had said.Although NMC stated that the Letter of Permission was being withdrawn as an inspection found non-compliance with minimum standards, the Sangharsh Samiti claimed it was a result of its prolonged agitation. “This is our first major victory,” its representatives said at a news briefing, adding, “Our current protest has ended but there are more issues, like the Shrine Board Act which needs amendment.”BJP’s J&K president and Rajya Sabha member Sat Sharma, too, welcomed the NMC decision, and thanked LG Manoj Sinha and Union health minister J P Nadda, for withdrawal of permission while safeguarding the interests of selected students.Kashmir-based parties, however, slammed the decision, terming it Jammu’s loss, and blamed BJP. NC minister Javed Rana said admissions in educational institutions shouldn’t be sought on the basis of religion. He accused BJP of “communalising” the issue of admissions in SMVDIME.PDP called it “a ruthless setback” for Jammu region, and blamed BJP. “People of Jammu must wake up to the reality that religious polarisation only sabotages their future. This entire episode was cynically engineered by BJP for narrow political gains in the name of religion, and it is Jammu that has been made to pay the price,” PDP youth wing president Aditya Gupta said.","National medical commission withdraws permission to shri mata vaishno devi institute of medical excellence (smvdime) in reasi, jammu.

It was then bifurcated into Ladakh and J&K. Those who split J&K state now want to divide it further and desire to make even Kanak Mandi a state,” minister for jal shakti, environment and tribal affairs Javed Rana said, taking a veiled dig at BJP. Kanak Mandi is a historic wholesale market in Jammu city.BJP legislators were free to raise the issue of separate statehood for Jammu, but there was no such demand from large parts of the region, including Pir Panjal areas of Rajouri and Poonch and the Chenab Valley, said Rana talking to reporters. “Instead, I believe that the day is not far when Ladakh will again become part of J&K,” he added.BJP MLAs, especially former minister Sham Lal Sharma, have renewed calls for a separate Jammu state. Sharma said the demand was not new and that he had raised it way back in 2010, when he was a minister in then Congress govt. Sharma claimed the people of Jammu are more “nationalistic”, while Kashmir, he alleged, has been politically unstable due to the rhetoric of political parties like National Conference that says J&K only acceded to India and did not fully merge with it.Sharma alleged that Jammu was facing discrimination at the hands of “Kashmir-based rulers”. He also called for a Hindu chief minister.On Jan 5, BJP spokesperson Rajni Sethi said Jammu was suffering because of what she described as “fundamentalists in Kashmir”. “When people from Jammu travel outside J&K, they are treated with suspicion and their identity is questioned. People assume Jammu is also influenced by extremism,” she said.Rejecting the charges, NC spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq said: “BJP has no politics except tarnishing Kashmiris and their image.” The govt would not allow BJP members to create a rift between Jammu and Kashmir,, he said, adding: “We believe in equitable development of both regions.

This new line — a set of machines — will replace two of the three lines at the Security Paper Mill, Narmadapuram in Madhya Pradesh, which have been in operation since the 1970s.With the addition of the new line at SPM, the facility will have the annual capacity to produce about 12,000 tonnes of high-security papers.Officials said the new line — comprising machines and other process systems — will be environment-friendly and save water. “The need was felt considering that the number of passports issued annually increased to over 14 million (1.4 crore) in 2024-25, and there is also more demand for stamp paper and sovereign security papers. There has also been an increase in the replacement of old banknotes.

Ten of these will be flagged off from poll-bound West Bengal and the remaining three from Assam, which is also going to the polls.TOI has learnt that on Jan 17, Modi will flag off Vande Bharat sleeper train from Howrah to Guwahati and six Amrit Bharat trains from Malda, where he will address a public event as well. The next day, he is scheduled to flag off two Amrit Bharat trains from Assam and three more from West Bengal.Officials said this is the first time in recent years that so many trains will be flagged off from West Bengal in such a short span of time. “The Amrit Bharat trains from West Bengal will be for all parts of the country — north, south and west. Amrit Bharat trains are the most affordable for the poor and the middle class, offering best comforts to passengers,” said an official.As per the plan, one Amrit Bharat train will operate between Guwahati and Rohtak (Haryana) and another between Dibrugarh and Lucknow. The Amrit Bharat trains from West Bengal are New Jalpaiguri-Nagercoil, New Jalpaiguri-Tiruchirappalli , Alipurduar-Bengaluru, Alipurduar-Panvel, Balurghat-Bengaluru, Radhikapur-Bengaluru, Santragachi (Kolkata)-Tambaram, Howrah-Anand Vihar (Delhi) and Sealdah-Banaras.“The focus is on running more Amrit Bharat trains as these cater to a large share of long-distance passengers. The zonal railways will soon notify the fares for each service,” said a railway official.So many modern trains being flagged off from West Bengal is being seen as a message that Centre is keen to improve transport infrastructure in the state.","Pm narendra modi is scheduled to flag off 13 trains next week, including the country’s first vande bharat sleeper train.

The project will connect the Delhi–Mumbai Expressway with the Bundelkhand Expressway and will pass through parts of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh.The 420-km expressway, a mix of expansion of existing highway stretches and construction of a greenfield section, would cost around Rs 14,000 crore. Road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari confirmed this to TOI on Tuesday. The decision was taken at a review meeting chaired by Gadkari on Monday evening and was attended by MP CM Mohan Yadav and two Union ministers — Bhupender Yadav and Jyotiraditya Scindia.National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will build the 6-lane access-controlled corridor. Officials said the alignment of the project was reworked after the earlier plan faced some issues. “The new alignment falls outside forest and wildlife areas, and also outside the Chambal ravines (beehad). After major modification in the alignment, the environment clearances have been obtained. The project will benefit aspirational (backward) regions in all the three states,” said an official.The access-controlled corridor will connect Kota in Rajasthan with Etawah in UP and cities in MP, including Morena and Bhind. This will reduce both travel time from 10-11 hours at present, to only 5-6 hoursOfficials said the corridor will also provide connectivity to Agra-Jhansi, Kota-Jhansi-Kanpur and Agra-Kanpur highways.

"For family’s sake, SC saves man from going to jail; stabbed wife in neck, flung 3-year-old child from first floor",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-familys-sake-sc-saves-man-from-going-to-jail-stabbed-wife-in-neck-flung-3-year-old-child-from-first-floor/articleshow/126404042.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a poignant reflection of women’s status in many marriages and the fear of ignominy and destitution that a divorce evokes, a wife, despite having been stabbed in the neck and having her child flung from the first floor by the husband, agreed to patch up with her spouse to save him from going to jail.The man from Himachal Pradesh wounded his wife with a knife and flung their three-year-old son from the first floor, leaving him seriously injured. He was chargesheeted for attempt to murder and other offences under IPC. The wife had also filed for divorce and sought maintenance.Facing incarceration for the grave offence, the man approached his wife, showed repentance and persuaded her to settle for a compromise, following which she withdrew the divorce petition. Soon, the man moved the Himachal high court for the quashing of charges on the ground that the couple were now living together peacefully. The HC refused to quash the charges, terming them grave in nature.Advocate Sukumar Pattajoshi, appearing for the man, pleaded Wednesday with an SC bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and S C Sharma, citing the the welfare of the young couple, who got married in 2020, and said the compromise was reached through the elder’s intervention.The state counsel opposed the plea, but the bench said, “No doubt it is a grave offence, but the couple’s wishes to stay together and give their married life a fresh chance should be respected. Sending the man to jail would not be in the interest of the family.”It issued a stern warning and asked him to give a written undertaking that he would take good care of his wife and child and not do anything detrimental to their interests and safety. Pattajoshi said he had agreed to appear for the man only after he gave an undertaking to that effect.Adding a caveat that it was quashing the criminal charges given the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case,it accepted the man’s written undertaking for amiable behaviour towards his wife and child and warned him of drastic consequences if he breached the undertaking.“If you do anything to the wife and child, you will be sent to jail straight away. Since Supreme Court will be sending you to jail, no court in the country will grant you bail,” the bench told the man who was present in court.",The man from himachal pradesh wounded his wife with a knife and flung their three-year-old son from the first floor.

Govt considers raising EPFO monthly wage cap to Rs 25k-30k; current Rs 15k ceiling fixed in Sept 2014,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-considers-raising-epfo-monthly-wage-cap-to-rs-25k-30k-current-rs-15k-ceiling-fixed-in-sept-2014/articleshow/126403263.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a move that could significantly enhance the coverage of Employees Provident Fund Organisation, a proposal to increase monthly wage ceiling beyond the current Rs 15,000 is back on the table amid suggestions that it should be raised to Rs 25,000-30,000 a month.The wage ceiling refers to the salary threshold up to which it is mandatory for a worker in an establishment covered under EPFO to make monthly contributions.Govt had earlier discussed a proposal to increase the threshold to Rs 25,000 - but it was put on the backburner due to reluctance of employers, who wanted the limit to be retained, with some suggesting that a higher cap should come with lower contribution. Some of the employee unions, however, had demanded a Rs 30,000 cut-off.The current ceiling was fixed over a decade ago, in Sept 2014, making it optional for anyone earning over Rs 15,000 to be part of EPFO. Since then, salaries have gone up significantly, and minimum monthly wages in many states even for unskilled workers are now above this threshold. This leaves many low wage or minimum wage earners outside the ambit of the social security organisation. Earlier this week, Supreme Court asked the labour ministry to review the cap within four months.The move will widen EPFO's subscriber base and bring more workers, especially in the unorganised sector, under the ambit of the retirement fund body. It comes at a time when the new labour codes have been notified, being likely to be implemented in the next few months with a clear focus to ensure that an employee's wages add up to at least 50% of the total remuneration, with the remaining being allowances.Officials said by clearly defining wages, the labour codes would reduce disputes over eligibility. They also said at the current cap, the bulk of contributions amount to around Rs 15,000 and increase will push up the level, helping workers have a larger pool of money at their disposal when they retire, especially with the role of compounding playing out. Recently, EPFO had mandated a minimum 25% balance in a subscriber's corpus while easing rules for withdrawal.Data available till FY24 has pegged the number of active contributing members under EPFO at nearly 7.4 crore, while nearly 32 crore member acco-unts exist under the retirement fund body, which include a mix of active and past contributors.","The wage ceiling refers to the salary threshold up to which it is mandatory for a worker in an establishment covered under epfo to make monthly contributions.

The central agency has taken over 27 FIRs linked to the unrest - 19 involving crimes against women, three armoury loot cases, two murders, and one each of rioting, kidnapping and criminal conspiracy.Last Friday, special judge Chatra Bhukhan Gogoi ruled that all six accused ""be tried by this court"". Appearing through video-conferencing from Manipur, the accused pleaded not guilty after charges were read out and explained.CBI prosecutor Swayamjeet Sharma told the court the investigation had yielded sufficient material and a strong prima facie case.
