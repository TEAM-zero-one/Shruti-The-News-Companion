Chirag tries to meet Paras, but fails

How will the BJP react?

'I have saved the party'

NEW DELHI: In a surprise turn of events, Chirag Paswan , the president of Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) founded by his father late Ram Vilas Paswan , was on Monday unceremoniusly unseated as the leader of the party in Lok Sabha.Chirag, who took over the mantle of the party in 2020 after the death of Ram Vilas Paswan, stood completely isolated at the top within his party.Five of the six members of Parliament of the LJP revolted against Chirag in an overnight coup and elected Pashupati Kumar Paras, his uncle, as the new leader of the party in Lok Sabha.Besides Pashupati Paras, the rebel group includes Chirag's cousin Prince Raj, Chandan Singh, Veena Devi and Mehboob Ali Kaiser.The group has already met Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to inform him about the changes in the party. In the coming days, the rebels may stake claim in the Election Commission to represent the real LJP and could also move to oust Chirag from the top party post. Nitish Kumar 's party, the Janta Dal (United), reacted with a sense of vindication to the deveopments within the LJP.Chirag had led an aggressive anti-Nitish Kumar campaign in the 2020 assembly elections and in the process dealt a heavy political blow to the ruling Janta Dal (United) inChirag walked out of the NDA in the state and contested the assembly elections against Nitish Kumar's party. He fielded nominees, some of them BJP rebels, against all the JD(U) candidates.As a result, the JD(U) ended up losing several seats due to triangular contest and for the first time it became the junior partner to the BJP in Bihar NDA.Little wonder, Nitish Kumar's party reacted with a dig at the developments within the LJP.""You reap what you sow,"" said JD(U)national president RCP Singh as he blamed Chirag for doing negative politics.""Chirag Paswan has committed so many blunders in the recent past. The people of Bihar and his own party workers and leaders were not happy with whatever he did during the Bihar assembly election. Now, it's results are coming in the form of a split in the party,"" Singh said.Given the bitter political rivalry between the two parties since the 2020 assembly elections, sources close to Chirag Paswan accused the JD(U) for the split in the LJP.The JD(U), on the other hand, blamed Chirag Paswan's negative politics for the rift within his party.The lone LJP MLA in the Bihar assembly has already left the party to join the JD(U).As the events unfolded on Monday, Chirag Paswan drove to his uncle's residence in the national capital to meet him and Prince Raj.Paswan, who has not been keeping well for some time, waited for over 20 minutes in his car before he was let into the house and then left after spending more than an hour inside.He left without saying a word to waiting media persons.It is believed that neither of the two rebel MPs met him. A household help said the two were not at home when the LJP chief arrived.It would be interesting to see as to how the BJP reacts to the latest developments in this game of one-upmanship between the JD(U) and the LJP in Bihar.Chirag Paswan has all along kept a very strong pro-BJP and pro-PM Modi stand and announced ahead of assembly elections that he is working for a BJP government in Bihar.Pashupati Paras, on the other hand, is percieved as pro-Nitish Kumar.Paras today lauded Nitish Kumar as a good leader and ""vikas purush"" (development-oriented man).With talks of Union Cabinet reshuffle, it would be interesting to see if the BJP decides to include Chirag Paswan to ensure that he is not completely marginalised within his own party.The JD(U) has declined to comment on speculations about one or more rebel LJP MPs being inducted into the Union cabinet from the party quota or getting accommodated in the state ministry.However, it has reiterated the party stand that all NDA allies ought to get a ""respectable"" share at the Centre.Pashupati Paras, who is an MP from Hajipur, a seat represented by Ram Vilas Paswan for several years, caimed that 99 per cent of LJP workers were unhappy with the leadership of Chirag Paswan in Bihar.""There are six MPs in our party. It was the desire of five MPs to save our party. So, I have not broken the party. I have saved it. Chirag Paswan is my nephew as well as the party's national president. I have no objection against him,"" Paras said when asked about the developments.Paras said his group will continue to be part of the BJP-led NDA, and added that Paswan can remain in the organisation.Regarding the rumours that LJP will be joining the Janta Dal (United) in Bihar, the Hajipur MP said, ""Existence of LJP will continue, we are not joining JDU. We will fulfill the ambition of Late Ramvilas Paswan.""",Lok janshakti party (ljp) chief chirag paswan failed to meet pashupati kumar paras at his house in new delhi.

Single dose of Covid-19 vaccine sufficient for already infected people: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/single-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-sufficient-for-already-infected-people-study/articleshow/83513073.cms,"HYDERABAD: A single dose of Covid-19 vaccine is sufficient for an infected person as there was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection, according to a study released by AIG Hospitals on Monday.The city-based AIG Hospitals recently published a study conducted on 260 healthcare workers, who got vaccinated between January 16 and February 5, in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases (a peer-reviewed journal).The study was designed to assess the immunological memory response in all those patients.All patients were given the Covishield vaccine.The study also said Memory T-cell responses elicited by a single dose of vaccine were significantly higher in the previously infected group compared with those who had no prior infection.Commenting on the impact that this study can have on the overall vaccine administration strategy, Dr. D Nageshwar Reddy , Chairman, AIG Hospitals, and one of the co-authors of the study, said the results show that people who got infected with Covid-19 need not take two doses of vaccine as a single dose can develop robust antibody and memory cell response at par with two-doses for those who didnt get the infection.This will significantly help at a time when theres a shortage of vaccine in the country and more people can be covered using the saved doses, Dr Reddy said.Once the requisite number of people are vaccinated for achieving herd immunity, these patients who got infected and received only one dose can take the second dose of the vaccine, he further said.At this point, all our strategies should be directed at the widespread distribution of available vaccines and to include the maximum number of people at least with a single dose, Dr Reddy added.",A single dose of covid-19 vaccine is sufficient for an infected person.

"Bihar polls: My age may be young, but my promise is mature, says Tejashwi Yadav",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-my-age-may-be-young-but-my-promise-is-mature-says-tejashwi-yadav/articleshow/125009260.cms,"Tejashwi Yadav (ANI)

As the Bihar assembly election campaign intensifies, INDIA bloc’s chief ministerial candidate, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, lays out his vision for development, employment and economic justice while taking aim at his political rivals.

He shares his plans to create jobs, strengthen the economy and build an inclusive Bihar with TOI’s AlokKNMishra. Excerpts:

You are the chief ministerial candidate of the INDIA bloc and have been campaigning extensively across Bihar for the past several weeks. What promises are you making to people, and what feedback are you getting?

“My Age May Be Young, But My Promise Is Mature,” Says Tejashwi Yadav Ahead of Bihar Polls

You have pledged to provide a govt job for every family. Critics argue that this may not be financially feasible for Bihar, which does not have the financial resources to fund this. How do you plan to implement this promise?

Have you consulted experts, carried out any study or prepared a blueprint for this?

The INDIA bloc and the NDA are both contesting the election on the development plank. How is the RJD-led alliance’s development plank different from the NDA's?

Having served as deputy chief minister under Nitish Kumar, what do you think about Nitish Kumar's style of leadership and the way he runs the Government?

RJD has traditionally relied on support from the Muslim-Yadav vote base. This time, you have fielded more candidates from women, Dalits, and EBC communities. How is the RJD attempting to broaden its appeal beyond the MuslimYadav combination?

The voting patterns in recent Bihar elections indicate that a larger share of EBC, upper-caste and several groups within the Dalit community voters have favoured the NDA over the RJD

Women in Bihar have traditionally been seen as strong supporters of Nitish Kumar. What strategies is the RJD adopting to attract more women voters in this election?

Do you think the women of Bihar are going to support the INDIA bloc this time?

The NDA is contesting the election under the leadership of Nitish Kumar, but it has not yet categorically announced that Nitish will be the CM if the NDA wins. What is your view on this?

Why will the NDA not make Nitish Kumar the CM?

RJD rule in Bihar ended 20 years ago. Even now, many people say that a return of the RJD to power could bring back the ‘jungle raj’ of the past. Why do such perceptions persist even after so many years since the RJD last governed Bihar?

You have been saying that Lalu Yadav gave social justice to the people of Bihar, and you will deliver economic justice. Can you elaborate?

There have been reports of internal differences within the INDIA bloc. How have you addressed or managed these challenges?

But across 11 se

ats, the INDIA bloc partners are contesting against each other in what is being described as a friendly fight.

Congress is an important partner of the RJD-led alliance in Bihar. It won 19 seats in 2020. How do you feel it is going to perform in this election?

Did you give any suggestions to Congress when they were finalising the tickets?

There seems to be tension in your family, with your elder brother’s newly formed party (Janshakti Janata Dal) contesting the election against many RJD candidates. As his younger brother, many would expect him to support you and stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this crucial time. How do you respond to this?

Is there any possibility of the RJD again aligning with Nitish Kumar’s party JD(U) in future?

How challenging is Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj for the INDIA bloc?

You are the INDIA bloc’s CM face. The VIP (Vikassheel Insaan Party) chief is the deputy chief minister face. Is there a possibility that there could be another deputy CM from the Muslim community?

We have taken an oath to make Bihar the number one state in the country and that is our ultimate objective. Our vision is to build a Bihar where no Bihari brother or sister has to migrate in search of work or opportunities. Every facility and opportunity should be available right here, in our own state. Bihar should have factories and job opportunities, as well as quality hospitals, colleges and universities.Factories should be set up, jute mills reopened, food processing units established and new IT parks and SEZs developed.Our goal is to make Bihar an educational hub so that students do not have to go to places like Kota to prepare for exams and we want to build good hospitals so that people do not have to travel outside the state for treatment. Bihar today is one of the poorest states with the lowest per capita income. We are determined to change that by ensuring that every citizen has access to education, healthcare, income, opportunities and justice – and that the govt is truly action-oriented.Bihar also has immense potential in the tourism sector – whether it is religious tourism, heritage tourism or general tourism. We want to develop this potential and promote Bihar as a major tourism destination. We want to make such a Bihar that moves ahead on the path of progress. We are getting a great response from the people who want a change in Bihar.Let the people say what they want to say. The last time, they were saying that giving 10 lakh jobs was impossible. Now, the same people – the BJP and JD(U) – have been forced to talk about jobs, and they are saying they will give one crore jobs. We have done and shown what we promised.We gave five lakh jobs – about 3.5 lakh every year during the 17 months from Aug 2022 to Jan 2024, when I served as deputy chief minister in the Grand Alliance govt. We also gave the status of Bihar govt employees to over four lakh contractual teachers in the state in Dec 2023. So, we have already done it, and soon we will turn this task – which looks impossible – into a possible one. My age may be young, but my promise is mature.We do not make any announcements without consulting the experts and without conducting the required research and study. We only make announcements that are feasible and practical. We have prepared the blueprint for it.The NDA has no development plank and no vision for Bihar. The BJP wants factories to be set up only in Gujarat – the semiconductor factory is in Gujarat, investor meetings are held there, SEZs are established there, and even the international stadium is built there.Everything is being done in Gujarat, while nothing is being done for Bihar. They have no road map or vision for Bihar. Amit Shah (union home minister) himself said that there is a dearth of land in Bihar, which is why factories and industries cannot be set up here. So, they have made it clear that they have no development plan for Bihar.At present, Nitish Kumar has been reduced to just a puppet. BJP is running the govt while Nitish Kumar is merely a figurehead – the real power lies with Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. We even have sympathy for Nitish Kumar, considering his current condition.This is the same Nitish Kumar who once snapped ties with the NDA after Narendra Modi was announced the chief of the BJP’s campaign committee for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. He had even cancelled a dinner planned for Modi in Patna. In the past, the same Nitish Kumar returned the Rs 5 crore Koshi flood relief donation from the Narendra Modi-led Gujarat govt in 2010 when the Gujarat govt issued advertisements for it.And now, Nitish ji has, unfortunately, become a puppet and his health condition also does not allow him to run the govt effectivelyThe RJD has always been a party for everyone – inclusive since the very beginning. No govt has given as much representation in the state cabinet to upper castes as the one led by Laluji. Similarly, no other govt has matched the number of leaders from the EBC category who were made MLAs, MLCs, and given various opportunities under the govt of Laluji.It was Laluji who made Bhagwati Devi, the daughter of the Musahar community, an MP. He ensured that every section of society received respect and representation in governance. Yes, some people may have left us at times, but eventually, all of them have come back — because they know that the RJD truly belongs to everyone.In the 2020 election, the difference between the NDA and the Mahagathbandhan was only 12,000 votes, which was less than 1%. It shows that we got votes from all sections of society.The women have woken up now. The truth has come out in the open – that women were often exploited and were denied the respect and rights they truly deserved. This is why there is a growing sense of dissatisfaction among women with the Nitish govt.See, due to growing dissatisfaction among women, the Nitish govt had to give a Rs 10,000 bribe to each woman just before the elections. They realised that their support base among women was drifting away, especially after we announced the ‘Mai Bahin Maan Yojana’ for the women of Bihar, under which women in Bihar will receive Rs 2,500 per month as financial assistance to make them financially independent, and we spoke about making Jeevika Didis permanent.This has clearly panicked the NDA. That is why they are giving out Rs 10,000 in the middle of the election, and yet the Election Commission is not stopping them. What is the emergency that justifies this?Amit Shah ji and the BJP are clear that Nitish Kumar will not become the chief minister again. It is totally clear. He will meet the same fate as Shinde ji (Eknath Shinde was not reinstated as CM after the BJP won a majority in the 2024 Maharashtra assembly elections).His situation is not the same. The BJP wants to have its own chief minister in Bihar because, until now, they have never had one. They aspire for it, but that ambition will never be fulfilled.See, this is nothing but complete propaganda and a wrong perception fuelled by those opposed to the RJD. Lalu ji always gave respect to everyone and worked to ensure equality in society. Those who considered themselves superior by birth had to sit at the same level as Dalits and backward communities. This created resentment among such people. True superiority comes from one’s actions, not from birth. Lalu ji made everyone equal and upheld this principle consistently.We are living in an economic age, and people deserve economic justice. Inflation is soaring, jobs are scarce, and household expenses are rising rapidly. How are people supposed to manage their daily lives? Since Modi came to power, under the NDA govt, everything has become more expensive.Modi ji had promised to bring down inflation, but prices have risen fivefold since he took office – fuel, food, and almost everything has become costlier, while people’s incomes remain stagnant. Small and medium-scale factories are shutting down, businesses are struggling and the economy is not growing as it should. The situation worsened further after Trump imposed tariffs. Now is the time to ensure true economic justice for the people.There were no fissures in the INDIA bloc. There was no problem. It was only in the media.The friendly fight is being conducted strategically. In Jharkhand, we contested and won elections despite similar arrangements. Likewise, in Jammu & Kashmir, the INDIA bloc had friendly fights, and they emerged victorious. In Bihar, the situation is no different. We remain united and strong, contesting the elections with our full strength, and we are going to win the elections.Congress will perform much better this time. We are confident of winning more seats compared to 2020, as we have focused carefully on the winnability factor and meticulously selected our candidates.We all sit together and discuss it – the selection of candidates.That’s alright. In a democracy, everyone has the right to form their own party and contest elections. Yes, it would have been far better if the things that happened had not happened, but this is the reality, and we have to accept it.Now, the Janata Dal (United) will not survive after the elections are over. Half of the JD(U) leaders will go to the BJP and half will come to the RJD.We do not care about such things – who is coming to Bihar, who is making what party. Our only focus is to make Bihar the number one state in the country. Our fight is against unemployment.It has already been announced that there will be one more deputy CM if the INDIA bloc forms the govt. When the right time comes, the decision about it will be taken collectively by the alliance partners and an announcement will be made.","Tejashwi prasad yadav is the chief ministerial candidate of the india bloc.

MUMBAI: Rohit Aarrya had doused the Powai studio with a petrol and rubber solution, threatening to set it ablaze if his demands were not met, according to the FIR filed by assistant police inspector Amol Waghmare, who entered the premises with three other cops to rescue the children and shot the captor in self defence after he “pointed to the pistol tucked in his waist at children’s side for a moment, and then pointed it towards me and my team, and he was about to fire”.Assistant police inspector Amol Waghmare, complainant in the hostage crisis, said in the FIR he reached the RA Studio complex around 2pm when chaos broke out. “A few parents rushed in, shouting that their children were not answering calls. Someone showed me a video circulating on WhatsApp — a man named Rohit Arryya claiming he had taken several children hostage inside the studio. He was threatening to burn the place down if anyone tried to intervene.Within minutes, police teams led by API Sohail Subedar and senior PI Sonawane reached the spot. The atmosphere was tense—parents were crying, and we could smell petrol from outside the studio. The accused doused the premises with a petrol and rubber solution, threatening to set it ablaze if his demands were not met. There were also batteries nearby. Police gained access through a duct and reached the first-floor bathroom where the children were confined.” TOI has a copy of the FIR.The children were kept hostage on the first floor. Waghmare along with sub-inspectors Rakesh Nalawade, Bade and Shinde entered through the bathroom window with the help of fire brigade. “We heard children crying in the bathroom.Then Rohit Aarrya entered and, leaving the children alone, at a distance of about two to three feet, he used a pepper spray, and then pointed to the pistol tucked in his waist... and was about to fire. To save myself, our team and children from being harmed, I fired a shot from my service pistol and he was injured. He was immediately taken to Jogeshwari trauma care hospital and the hostages were rescued and handed over to their parents. ”The FIR stated before the police team entered the studio, Rohan Aher who worked as assistant to Aarrya appeared at the window and told the cops that Aarrya had confined four children with ropes and put adhesive tapes on their mouths. “We saw a person from the window on the first floor saying his name was Rohit Aarrya and he started talking to us policemen. At that time, since his voice was not clear, Sonawane took his mobile number from one Amol Dorugade and called Aarrya on his mobile number. ” Aher is the key witness in the case, said the police.Cops requested him to release the children and promised to fulfil his demands. DCP Datta Nalawade called and tried to talk to him, but he was not stating clearly what his demand was. He threatened on phone that he would set the place on fire and may harm the children, the FIR said.","Aarrya poured petrol all over, pointed gun at kids and pointed it at cops.

Deadly Stampede at Andhra Pradesh After Chaos, Panic Strikes Venkateswara Temple, At Least 10 Dead





VIJAYAWADA: A stampede at a privately run temple in Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh killed nine devotees — eight women and a 13-year-old boy — and left more than 25 injured Saturday morning, after a railing collapse on a narrow staircase caused panic in a crowd of over 20,000 gathered for Karthika Ekadashi.The toll may rise as the condition of some of the injured is critical.The Venkateswara Swamy temple, located at Kasibugga under Palasa mandal and modelled on the Tirumala shrine in Tirupati, was built by 94-year-old Hari Mukund Panda from Odisha and opened just four months ago.One gate serving as both entry and exit, poor crowd control, and lack of official clearance turned the pilgrimage into chaos. “Nobody is responsible — it was an act of god,” Panda said.District police chief KV Maheswara Reddy said the main sanctum sits on the first floor with about 20 steps leading to it.“A railing along the staircase, believed to be poorly constructed, collapsed and caused a person to fall, triggering panic as the packed crowd surged forward,” he said.Calling the deaths “extremely heart-breaking”, CM N Chandrababu Naidu said: “Had police been informed in advance, they could have implemented a crowd management plan.Those responsible will face action.”Venkateswara Swamy temple at Kasibugga, visited by around 3,000 devotees on Saturdays, saw a crowd nearly seven times that number on the day of the stampede as it was the first Karthika Ekadashi since the temple’s inauguration. With no prior approval for the gathering or adequate security, the few guards were overwhelmed.District police chief K V Maheswara Reddy said temple authorities failed to alert police or the district administration about the festival and the likely crowd. Police have registered a case under section 100 (culpable homicide) of BNS and detained four temple staff for questioning.The shrine isn’t registered with Andhra Pradesh’s endowments department, which oversees thousands of temples. “Everything looked fine around 9am, but suddenly the number of devotees surged. Narrow stairway was choked. I was nearby when the railing broke and people started falling over each other,” said R Ramanamma, a devotee.The deceasad were identified as E Chinnammi (46), R Vijaya (48) from Tekkali; M Neelamma (60) from Vajrapukotturu; D Rajeswari (60), G Rupa (50), B Brunda from Mandasa; Ch Yasodamma (56) from Nandigam; D Ammulamma from Kasibugga; and L Nikhil (13) from Sompeta. Two women — B Kalavathi and R Kumari — remain critical. “I have instructed officials to ensure proper treatment for the injured,” chief minister Naidu said.PM Modi said he was “pained” by the tragedy. “My thoughts are with those who have lost their near and dear ones. I pray that the injured recover soon,” he said, announcing Rs 2 lakh ex gratia to each victim’s family and Rs 50,000 to the injured. Saturday’s crush was the third major temple tragedy in Andhra Pradesh this year — following six deaths at Tirupati’s Vaikunta Ekadashi token centre on Jan 8 and seven killed in a wall collapse at Visakhapatnam’s Simhachalam temple on Apr 30.","A railing collapse on a narrow staircase caused panic in a crowd of over 20,000 gathered for karthika ekadashi.

NEW DELHI: Stepping up its money laundering probe against Anil Ambani and his Reliance group, ED on Friday attached properties worth more than 3,000 crore, which included Ambani's Pali Hill house in Bandra in Mumbai and other flats, plots and offices of Reliance Communication and Reliance Infrastructure Ltd in Delhi, Noida, Mumbai, Goa, Pune, Hyderabad and Chennai among other cities.Asked for its reaction, Anil Ambani's Reliance group did not comment. According to sources, the Reliance Centre, Ambani's office at Hotel Ranjit in Delhi, is among several properties attached by ED in lieu of alleged diversion of bank funds of more than 20,000 crore.According to sources, the Reliance Centre, Ambani's office at Hotel Ranjit in the heart of Delhi - spread over more than three acres at Maharaja Ranjit Singh Marg, located between Ramlila Ground and Ranjit Singh flyover - is among the several properties attached by the central agency in lieu of alleged diversion of bank funds to the tune of more than 20,000 crore.Sources said ED in its attachment order has alleged that Ambani group entities indulged in diversion of bank funds, which were further lent to shell companies and wholly owned subsidiaries of the group with an intention to siphon off the proceeds. ""Substantial portions of corporate loans ultimately landed in accounts of Reliance group companies,"" sources said, hinting at round-tripping of the laundered funds.More attachments are likely to follow in the weeks ahead.Since July, ED has carried out multiple searches on Ambani, his associates and group entities, including at his Mumbai residence. He was also summoned and questioned at ED's headquarters in Delhi on Aug 5.ED's investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act is based on two FIRs registered by CBI against Ambani and his entities for alleged bank loan frauds. Ambani has already been put under a travel ban, and cannot go out of the country. His close aide Angarai Sethuraman is among a number of his close associates already grilled by ED.Reliance Communication, the group entity of Ambani which owns the Reliance Centre office at Maharaja Ranjit Singh Marg in Delhi, is under investigation for alleged diversion of more than 13,600 crore of funds.","Anil ambani's pali hill house in bandra in mumbai attached by ed.

Justice Ramana

slams attempts to crush farmers’ movement

Justice N V Ramana (retd) disclosed Saturday that the Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government filed police cases against his family to target him before he became the Chief Justice of India in 2021 because they supported Amaravati capital city project of Andhra Pradesh.""All of you present here know how my family was targeted and criminal cases were filed against them. All this was done only to coerce me,"" he said while addressing students at the convocation ceremony of VIT-AP at Amaravati.The Jagan Reddy government diluted the previous N Chandrababu Naidu government's Amaravati capital project by announcing the trifurcation of the capital, which was opposed by farmers whose land had already been acquired.The farmers agitated for five years from 2019 till 2024 and the trifurcation idea was dropped after the Chandrababu Naidu government returned to office last year.Recalling his deep association with Amaravati since his student days, he said, ""Present-day Amaravati owes its existence to the resilience of the farmers of this region. The city survives on the back of the farmers' struggle, one of the longest in southern India.""Talking about attempts to ""crush the farmers' struggle"", Justice Ramana said, ""Rarely the media or any politician ever spoken the truth or given real credit as to how the capital of Amaravati survived and sustained,"" he said.Briefly touching on the ""painful days of police action"" against his family members, the former CJI said, ""I was not alone. During that difficult period, all those who empathised with the cause of the farmers, faced intimidation and coercion."" ""Even members of the judiciary who upheld constitutional principles faced transfers, pressure, and at times, persecution. Families of judges, who had no role, suffered collateral damage because of political machinations,"" he said.In these testing times, many political leaders hesitated to take a stand and preferred silence, he said. ""It was the jurists, lawyers and the courts which stood by their constitutional promise,"" he said. ""While govts may change, the courts and the rule of law remain as the anchor of stability. The rule of law survives only when people, in whom the public repose trust, decline to surrender their integrity for convenience,"" he said.""In the coming times, the role of farmers, lawyers, jurists, members of civil society and judges will have to remain the enduring source of inspiration with their integrity and commitment to rule of law,"" he said.","Y s jagan mohan reddy government targeted my family with cases, says ex-cji n v ramana.

Chandigarh Press Club condemned the police action in the ""strongest terms"" and said, ""Such actions are seen as an attack on Press freedom and an attempt to control the free flow of information through state machinery. ""Newspapers could not be delivered in many areas because of this, leaving readers miffed. In others, it was severely delayed.

Later, Punjab Police issued a statement to say that ""various kinds of commercial vehicles"" were searched following ""intelligence inputs"" that drugs and weapons were smuggled in connivance with such drivers.Punjab DGP Gaurav Yadav declined calls from TOI. Special DGP Arpit Shukla said over the phone, ""I have come to know that the searches were carried out following inputs that drivers of the vehicles may have connived to smuggle drugs and illegal weapons.""The coordinated police action started around 4am on Sunday just when vehicles carrying newspapers began leaving presses.Several drivers told TOI that their phones were taken away.

""The scheme of the Act, insofar as it contemplates attachment of properties of an accused prior to conviction, is necessary because of the fact that on initiation of criminal proceedings, it is often the case that the accused transfer or alienate the properties acquired by them through commission of offences to frustrate the trial,"" it said.""In view of the covert nature of the operation of gangs, recovery of such properties, consequent to their alienation by the accused, is rendered hopeless.

Mokama Murder Case: JD(U) Candidate Anant Singh Arrested Over Killing of Jan Suraaj Worker

From allies to arch-rivals

The killing that reignited the faultlines



The caste arithmetic in Mokama

Bhumihars: Around 55,000–60,000

Yadavs: Around 40,000

Dhanuks (Koeris): Around 45,000

Muslims and Dalits: Together account for roughly 30 per cent of the electorate.

Verdict to echo beyond boundaries

NEW DELHI: The murder of 76-year-old Dularchand Yadav while he was campaigning for a Jan Suraaj candidate has ruptured a long-smouldering local equilibrium in Mokama, turning what should have been a routine assembly fight into a high-stakes prestige battle between two bahubali figures and the caste blocs that back them.The Mokama battle is centred around two powerful strongmen from the influential Bhumihar caste: Anant Singh , akaof JD(U) and Surajbhan Singh, who is aligned with RJD.What was shaping up to be a familiar, muscle-driven election in Mokama has now turned into a prestige battle with caste loyalties, community pride, and the question of law and order hanging in the balance.To understand the intensity of Mokama’s politics, one must go back two decades to a time when the Singh brothers of Barh and Mokama defined the region’s power matrix. Anant Kumar Singh, once a close aide of Nitish Kumar , rose rapidly in the early 2000s as the enforcer of the JD(U)’s presence in the Bhumihar belt. Known for his flamboyant persona, blunt speech, and a knack for dispensing justice outside the system, Anant became both feared and adored -- the archetypal bahubali of central Bihar.On the other hand, Surajbhan Singh, hailing from the nearby Begusarai–Barh area, was cut from the same cloth -- a Bhumihar strongman who turned to politics after a string of criminal cases.Aligned first with the LJP under Ram Vilas Paswan and later seen close to the RJD ecosystem, Surajbhan represented the rival pole of Bhumihar assertion. Their rivalry was not just personal. It was territorial and symbolic.Both commanded loyalty among the Bhumihars, both controlled local networks of influence, and both saw themselves as the natural claimant to the region’s political crown.In the early 2000s, there were phases when the two operated within the same broader political alliance. But as Nitish Kumar consolidated power in 2005, Anant Singh emerged as the JD(U)’s uncontested strongman, while Surajbhan’s camp drifted toward the LJP-RJD axis.Anant Singh's political rise, from muscleman to MLA, coincided with Surajbhan's declining electoral influence due to criminal convictions. Yet, the latter's family continued to retain sway over nearby constituencies through his wife, Veena Devi.Over the years, the rivalry took violent turns as their supporters clashed over land control, local contracts, and political dominance.Mokama, Barh, and adjoining areas became a microcosm of Bihar’s bahubali politics, where muscle met caste mobilisation and the rule of law often bent to the weight of reputation.The murder of Dularchand Yadav on Thursday has revived the darker shades of that rivalry. Yadav, a campaigner for Jan Suraaj, was reportedly attacked while mobilising support for the party’s candidate in a region where Yadav and Dhanuk voters are crucial swing blocs.Police have arrested Anant Singh in connection with the killing, prompting a wave of outrage from opposition ranks and a renewed debate over Bihar’s law and order under Nitish Kumar.For the ruling camp, it’s an embarrassment to have a high-profile candidate in custody during an election campaign. For the opposition, it is less a moral crusade than a political opening and a chance to highlight administrative ""lapses"", question Nitish Kumar's control over his own strongmen, and mobilise discontent in a constituency long defined by muscle and loyalty rather than party lines.However, reacting to Anant Singh's arrest, the ruling NDA has maintained that, unlike the Lalu regime, no leader can have immunity from legal action.According to the latest electoral roll (as of January 2024), Mokama has about 2.9 lakh registered voters. The constituency’s caste composition is sharply layered:In the 2020 Bihar Assembly election, Anant Kumar Singh, contesting as an Independent, secured 78,721 votes, which was about 53 per cent of all valid votes cast in Mokama. The victory affirmed his influence among sections of the Bhumihar community, which forms a significant part of the constituency’s voter base.This time, however, the equations appear more fluid. The killing of a Jan Suraaj worker belonging to the Yadav community has introduced an unpredictable element into the contest.It is believed the incident could influence voter sentiment, particularly among backward caste groups such as Yadavs and Dhanuks, who together make up nearly 30 per cent of the electorate.At the same time, the Bhumihar vote, which has largely remained cohesive in previous elections, may witness some degree of division given the presence of more than one influential leader from within the community.With both Anant Singh and Surajbhan Singh commanding their own networks, political observers say a section of forward-caste voters could align differently this time.In a constituency with fewer than three lakh electors, even a 5–10 per cent shift in turnout or community alignment is equivalent to about 15,000–25,000 votes, which could significantly affect the final outcome.If Anant Singh wins, it will restate that the Bahubali era in Bihar has not ended -- it has merely evolved. The forms may have changed, but the substance of power remains rooted in personality, caste pride, and the defiant cult of local strongmen.For Nitish Kumar, a victory under such a shadow would still signal control, proof that his political arithmetic can withstand scandal, sentiment, and scrutiny alike.If the opposition wrests the seat, it would not necessarily mark a moral shift, for none of Mokama’s contenders are untouched by the state’s legacy of muscle and might, but it would signal a recalibration. It would suggest that alliances, caste equations, and public perception can still tilt the scales even against entrenched power.Either way, the fight in Mokama has outgrown the ballot box. It has become a test of endurance between two political orders, both born of Bihar’s rough-and-tumble past, both adapting to a voter base that now weighs loyalty as much as legacy.","Mokama battle centred around two powerful strongmen from influential bhumihar caste. Anant singh akaof jd(u) and surajbhan singh, who is aligned with rjd. Yadav, a campaigner for jan suraaj, was reportedly attacked while mobilising support for the party’s candidate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125032619,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-57646,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav has drawn sharp criticism from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after videos of him celebrating Halloween with his grandchildren surfaced on social media on Saturday.The BJP accused the former Bihar chief minister of hypocrisy, pointing out that he had earlier termed the Maha Kumbh festival “meaningless”.The party’s Kisan Morcha, in a post on X, said, “Don’t forget, people of Bihar, this is the same Lalu Yadav who had called the grand festival of faith and spirituality Maha Kumbh useless and is now celebrating the festival of Halloween. Those who attack faith will not get votes from the people of Bihar.”The videos were shared by Lalu’s daughter and RJD leader Rohini Acharya, who posted pictures of the family’s Halloween celebrations with the caption, “Happy Halloween to everyone.” The visuals showed Yadav posing for photos with his grandchildren dressed in costumes.Halloween, observed annually on October 31, is one of the most popular festivals in Western countries. Its roots trace back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, which marked the close of the harvest season and the onset of winter - a period once thought to dissolve the boundary between the living and the dead.In modern times, the celebration features costumes, trick-or-treating, pumpkin carving, eerie decorations, and themed parties.Lalu had sparked a row in February this year after he called the Maha Kumbh festival in Prayagraj “faltu"" (meaningless). Asked about the large crowds attending the religious gathering, he had said, “The Kumbh has no meaning… It is just meaningless.” His comment came while reacting to a stampede at the New Delhi railway station that left 18 people dead and several injured as passengers rushed to board trains bound for the religious congregation.Asked about the massive crowds travelling to Prayagraj and measures for crowd management, the RJD chief had said, “Kumbh ka kahan koi matlab hai. Faltu hai Kumbh (Is there any meaning to Kumbh? It is just meaningless).”The remarks triggered strong criticism from the BJP and several Hindu religious leaders, who accused Yadav of politicising the tragedy. Bihar BJP spokesperson Manoj Sharma said the statement reflected the RJD’s “mindset towards Hinduism”, while deputy chief minister Vijay Kumar Sinha charged the RJD leader with insulting Sanatana dharma and engaging in politics over the deaths.The fresh exchange between the BJP and RJD comes just days before the Bihar assembly elections, with polling scheduled in two phases on November 6 and 11 for the 243-seat assembly. Counting of votes will take place on November 14.","Lalu prasad yadav has drawn sharp criticism from the bharatiya janata party (bjp) the bjp accused the former bihar chief minister of hypocrisy, pointing out that he had earlier termed the maha kumbh festival “meaningless”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125028769,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1026852,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

PM Modi Rips Into RJD-Congress For ‘Insulting Faith’, Warns Bihar Voters

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday sharpened his attack on the Opposition’s INDIA bloc during his campaign rallies in Bihar’s Arrah, Bhojpur, and Nawada districts, alleging that the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) “forced” the Congress to announce Tejashwi Yadav as their chief ministerial candidate.As per PTI, PM Modi claimed that the Congress “never wanted” Tejashwi to be declared the alliance’s CM face but was pressured into doing so. “The RJD secured it by placing a katta (country-made gun) on the head of the Congress. They have learnt their lessons in the school of jungle raj. Such elements can never do good for Bihar,” he said at a rally in Bhojpur.The Prime Minister alleged that the RJD’s “hooliganism” and “strong-arm politics” reflected the party’s old ways of governance.As per news agency ANI, the Prime Minister said, “Just a day before nomination filing, behind closed doors, gundagardi was happening. Congress did not want to have an RJD CM, but RJD did not leave the opportunity. They put a gun on Congress' head and stole the CM’s post.”He further claimed that the alliance partners were divided and would “break each other’s heads” after the elections.PM Modi also said that the ruling NDA represented unity and development, while the Opposition alliance symbolised “jungle raj marked by katta, grirta, katuta, kusanskar, kushashan, and corruption.”He alleged that the RJD-Congress combine was working to “erase Bihar’s identity” by supporting infiltrators.In Nawada, PM Modi highlighted the NDA’s promise to give an additional Rs 3,000 to farmers under the state’s ‘Kapurgari Thakur Kisan Samman Nidhi’ scheme, over and above the ₹6,000 provided annually under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi.“This is Modi — jinhe koi nahi poochhta, Modi unhe poojta hai (Modi worships those whom no one else cares about),” he said, as reported by ANI.The PM claimed Rs 650 crore had already been deposited into accounts of two lakh farmers in Nawada and noted that the NDA’s policies were aimed at uplifting small farmers, “ignored since Independence.”He also took a swipe at the Congress for corruption during past governments, recalling Rajiv Gandhi’s remark that only “15 paisa out of every rupee sent from Delhi reached the villages.”PM Modi added that his government ensures that “the full amount reaches farmers without any cut or commission.”As per news agency PTI, the PM urged people to reject “those responsible for jungle raj,” asserting that the NDA government was “upright, foresighted, and committed to building a developed Bihar as part of a Viksit Bharat.”He also invoked Operation Sindoor, saying it “made the nation proud,” and targeted the Congress for “losing sleep when terrorists were being bombed.”Polling for Bihar’s 243 assembly seats will take place in two phases — on November 6 and 11 — with counting on November 14.",Pm narendra modi sharpened his attack on the opposition’s india bloc during his campaign rallies in bihar.

MUMBAI: A 45-year-old social entrepreneur who ran a project for the state govt held 17 children, aged 12-15, a 75-year-old woman and his staffer hostage for three hours at a recording studio in Powai Thursday afternoon after calling them for auditions for a web series.The crisis ended after a police commando team stormed the studio following failed negotiations. Police said they shot him in the chest in self-defence after he fired from an air gun. He was declared dead in hospital.Police said Aarrya owned a company, Apsara Media, that directed awareness videos on social causes and had extensively worked with children.They said he had been holding auditions at RA Studio in Powai for the past five days for a web series he was planning. Thursday was the final casting call.Auditions began at 10am and the children—hailing from Navi Mumbai, Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli and other parts of the state—arrived earlier, said a security guard at Mahavir Classik, which housed the studio.The hostage drama played out after the captor, Rohit Aarrya, who had been living in a relative’s Chembur flat for the past few days, released a video saying he wanted “simple answers” to some questions and threatened to set the place ablaze if there was any move made to challenge him.In the clip, which was circulated to many media outlets, he said he was not a terrorist and only wanted “to be heard”. “Instead of dying by suicide, I have held some children hostage,” he said.The captor, Rohit Aarrya , was a social entrepreneur and project management consultant who owned a company, Apsara Media, that directed awareness videos on social causes.His social media profile showed he was an alumnus of Symbiosis International University, Pune, and had completed an executive MBA from ISB, Mumbai.He had worked extensively with children on the central govt’s Swacchh Bharat initiative, saying he was inspired by PM Narendra Modi’s plan for cleanliness in public spaces.Since 2017, Aarrya had engaged actors, including Prem Chopra, to enact short videos to generate awareness. He claimed actor Ramesh Deo as his mentor. His social media profiles contain pictures of ministers and a few celebrities.He said he had taken the children hostage “according to a plan”. “I really want to conduct the ‘Let’s Change’ programme. I am going to do it. If I am alive, then I will do it. If I die, then someone else will do it. But it will definitely happen,” he said.His tone then turned menacing. “It will happen with these kids only if they are not harmed. Because the slightest wrong move from your end will trigger me to set this place on fire and die in it.Whether I die or not, the kids will definitely be unnecessarily hurt and traumatised. I don’t know what will happen to them. If something does happen to them, I should not be held responsible.""Those persons should be held responsible who are triggering this unnecessarily, when a normal, common person just wants to talk. After my discussions are over, I will come out myself. I am not alone. I have more people with me. Many people have similar problems as mine. And I am going to give this solution only by talking. Please do not trigger me to do some harm to anybody.”Police spent nearly two hours trying to negotiate with the captor, Rohit Aarrya, and gauge his demands, but he refused to cooperate, even after one of the girls’ parents said she suffered from seizures, cops said. An official said he appeared calm when police spoke to him.City police chief Deven Bharti maintained that Aarrya fired first, prompting retaliatory police firing.“Regardless of his demands, we couldn’t let him play with lives. Our team fired back in self-defence. There was no other option.”Other officials reiterated that the safety of those held captive was the priority, adding that the team’s response was measured and as per the protocol. The death prompted calls by legal experts for a magisterial inquiry.","The crisis ended after a police commando team stormed the studio following failed negotiations.
