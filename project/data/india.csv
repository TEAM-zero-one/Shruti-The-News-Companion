Who was Saquib Nanchan?



NEW DELHI: Saquib Nachan, an ISIS-linked convicted terrorist, died at Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi on Saturday while receiving medical treatment, as confirmed by Tihar Jail authorities.Nachan was incarcerated in Tihar Jail Number 1 from December 27, 2023, before being transferred to a hospital due to his declining health condition.His medical journey involved an initial referral to Deen Dayal Upadhyay (DDU) Hospital on June 22, followed by a transfer to Safdarjung Hospital on June 25. The Tihar administration received notification at 4 pm that Nachan had expired at 11.30 am on Saturday, according to ANI.His remains will be released to his family following post-mortem examination, with the final rites scheduled for Sunday at Borivali village near Padgha.Saquib faced conviction for his role in the Mumbai bomb blasts of 2002 and 2003, and held the position of self-proclaimed Amir-e-Hind for ISIS in India.The NIA's 2023 arrest of Nachan was based on allegations of his active involvement in promoting ISIS terrorist activities, the designated foreign terrorist organisation.The agency alleged his participation in the creation, instruction and assessment of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) intended for terrorist operations.According to the federal agency, Nachan collaborated with other accused individuals in what became known as the Pune ISIS module case.Sources indicate that his son and legal representative visited him in hospital earlier this week.Following his conviction in 2016 for the 2002-03 Mumbai bomb blasts, Nachan completed a 10-year sentence before release, according to the official.In 2023, the National Investigation Agency apprehended Nachan and others for alleged terrorist activities, including IED production to advance the agenda of the banned ISIS organisation.NIA reports identified Nachan as the primary accused and self-proclaimed leader who administered the 'Bayath' oath of allegiance to the self-styled 'Khalifa' of ISIS for new members.Investigation agencies reported that the accused had declared the village an independent zone and centre for their alleged anti-national operations.In June 2024, the NIA filed charges against him and 16 other ISIS operatives. The charges pertained to their alleged conspiracy to recruit youth, produce explosives, propagate ISIS ideology in India, and manufacture improvised explosive devices in connection with the Delhi-Padgha ISIS terror module case.The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) conducted extensive searches at 22 locations in Borivali and Padgha in early June, briefly detaining several suspects, including Nachan's relatives, who were released after questioning.""Two separate cases were registered in connection with these searches, which were based on specific inputs that Nachan and his associates had brainwashed and instigated people from the village to participate in anti-national activities,"" the official said.The ATS statement indicated the searches were part of measures following the April 22 Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir, aimed at identifying anti-national elements providing logistical support for terrorist activities.Police have increased security presence in Padgha and neighbouring Bhiwandi in preparation for Nachan's final rites.""We are keeping a tab on the situation,"" said a police official.","Saquib nachan, an isis-linked convicted terrorist, died at safdarjung hospital in new delhi on saturday.

Maharashtra language row: Deputy CM Eknath Shinde hits back at Shiv Sena (UBT); calls opposition ‘double-faced’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-language-row-deputy-cm-eknath-shinde-hits-back-at-shiv-sena-ubt-calls-opposition-double-faced/articleshow/122138171.cms,"File photo: Maharashtra deputy CM Eknath Shinde (Picture credit: PTI)

NEW DELHI: Amid a growing political uproar over the Maharashtra government’s move to introduce Hindi in schools, deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde on Saturday lashed out at the Shiv Sena (UBT), accusing it of playing “double-faced” politics and misrepresenting facts around the three-language formula.Responding to Uddhav Thackeray ’s faction’s demand for the resignation of school education minister Dada Bhuse, Shinde was quoted as saying by news agency ANI, “The then chief minister of Maharashtra had made mandatory the teaching of three languages – Marathi, English, and Hindi – based on the recommendations of the Raghunath Mashelkar Committee. When they were in power, they had a different opinion. Now that they are not, their stand has completely changed. The people who practise double-faced politics have no right to demand Dada Bhuse’s resignation.”This comes after Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray accused the BJP-led state government of forcing Hindi upon students and demanded that no language should be imposed. “Focus on what children are already studying. Restructure it and make it better. But don’t burden students further,” he said.NCP supremo Sharad Pawar also opposed the move, stating that while Hindi is widely spoken, it should not be forced at the primary level.“Let them learn Hindi after Class 5. But imposing it too early burdens children and sidelines their mother tongue,” he told reporters, urging the state to withdraw its insistence.Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut blamed the central government, claiming that the decision was part of the new education policy promoted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah. “This wasn’t the Maharashtra government’s decision. It was imposed by the Centre. The new education policy has been opposed by many states,” Raut alleged, as quoted by ANI.Meanwhile, deputy CM Ajit Pawar clarified that the cabinet would soon discuss the matter. “We’ve never supported forcing Hindi from the beginning. Let it be taught from Class 5, not earlier,” he said, according to news agency PTI.The controversy was triggered after an April 16 government resolution made Hindi mandatory as a third language in Marathi- and English-medium schools. Following backlash, the rule was amended to say Hindi would be the third language “in general,” with students allowed to opt for alternatives if at least 20 of them chose so.CM Devendra Fadnavis has also defended the policy, asserting that Marathi remains compulsory, while Hindi and English follow the Mashelkar committee recommendations accepted by the previous Uddhav Thackeray government. He said, “Marathi is compulsory. Hindi is optional. Students can choose any Indian language.”The issue is likely to be discussed during the upcoming monsoon session of the state legislature, with opposition parties planning joint protests against what they call the “imposition” of Hindi.",Eknath shinde accuses shiv sena (ubt) of playing 'double-faced' politics.

NEW DELHI: Amidst the growing rift with the Congress Party, Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor on Saturday appears to have sided with the RSS-BJP over the leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi's accusation that the RSS wanted 'Manusmriti', not the Constitution.While answering to a question over Rahul Gandhi's tweet that the RSS-BJP want Manusmriti instead of the Constitution, Congress MP said that historically the Raebareli MP is right as then RSS chief MS Golwalkar had said that one of the greatest flaws of the Constitution is that there is nothing of the Manusmriti in it. ""But I think the RSS itself has moved on from those days,"" Tharoor said.""Historically, he's (Rahul Gandhi) referring to the fact that that was a criticism expressed at the time of the adoption of the Constitution. Mr Golwalkar, amongst others, said that one of the greatest flaws of the Constitution is that there is nothing of the Manusmriti in it, but I think the RSS itself has moved on from those days. So, as a historical statement, it's accurate, whether it's a reflection of how they feel today. The RSS should be in the best position to answer that..."" Tharoor said while talking to reporters.Shashi Tharoor’s widening rift with the Congress Party has come under renewed spotlight after a string of pointed remarks and cryptic social media posts seemingly challenging the party's leadership.One such post read, “Don’t ask permission to fly. The wings are yours. And the sky belongs to no one.” This, followed by a series of similar messages, signaled growing tensions between Tharoor and the party.The tensions between Tharoor and Congress leadership rose after he praised PM Modi’s diplomacy during Operation Sindoor in a Hindu article, describing his “energy” and “dynamism” as assets for India’s global standing. The PMO shared the piece, fuelling speculation about Tharoor’s loyalty.Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge indirectly rebuked him, suggesting his praise for PM Modi was inappropriate. ""We say nation first, but some consider Modi first, country later. What can we do about that?"" he asked.Tharoor, however, clarified that his remarks reflected national interest, not support for the BJP.","Thiruvananthapuram mp shashi tharoor appears to have sided with the rss-bjp over rahul gandhi's accusation that the rss wanted 'manusmriti', not the constitution.

IIT-Kanpur to conduct trials for artificial rain

Delhi govt is likely to conduct a cloud seeding pilot project between July 4 and 11, when weather is expected to be feasible for causing artificial rain, city environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said. He added that govt had received a report from IMD, which has been shared with DGCA along with a flight map for getting permission for the project.The govt has chalked out a tentative flight plan for the experiment, which includes Bawana, Rohini, Alipur, Kundli and Burari. The minister said IMD's reports and the flight map were approved in coordination with IIT Kanpur.The Delhi cabinet had on May 7 okayed a proposal to conduct five cloud-seeding trials, with a project outlay of Rs 3.21 crore. The trials were to be carried out in May-end and early June in collaboration with IIT Kanpur.""The met department told us that till July 3 conditions are not feasible for cloud seeding; however, the July 4-11 window is favourable. DGCA has sought a backup time window in case cloud-seeding turns unfeasible during July 4-11 due to weather changes,"" Sirsa said.""We believe that by Monday we'll see progress in getting approvals from DGCA,"" the minister said.Cloud seeding is a weather-modification technique that introduces chemicals into the air to aggregate and condense moisture particles into rain. In this technique, compounds such as silver iodide (AgI) are released into the atmosphere to aid the formation of ice crystals that lead to rain.Soon after the formation of the BJP-led govt in Delhi, Sirsa announced that they would seek no-objection certificates from agencies concerned for conducting artificial rain in the winter season, when the capital records high pollution levels. Later, on June 18, the minister said govt had received all clearances barring that from the DGCA. For cloud seeding, clearances are needed from the Special Protection Group (SPG), Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Union ministries of environment, defence and home, UP govt, IMD as well as DGCA, Airport Authority of India and the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security.Trials for artificial rain will be executed by IIT Kanpur, which had earlier conducted the experiment using its own modified aircraft equipped with a mist sprinkler aiming to cover a minimum of 100sq km per sortie. The minister had earlier said IIT Kanpur's aircraft has the necessary permit from DGCA and can remain in the air for around five hours. Scientists from IIT Kanpur expect the sortie to take at least one hour and 30 minutes. The minister had also stated that after the trial, water samples will be collected to conduct a study to ensure see if there are harmful chemicals in it.He added that as per global studies and an earlier trial run by IIT Kanpur, the success rate is around 60-70%. As per IIT Kanpur, nimbostratus clouds are the most suitable type for seeding experiments. These are usually at heights of 500-6,000 meters above ground level.The previous AAP govt had repeatedly proposed conducting artificial rain during winters but shelved it citing unfavourable meteorological conditions. During the winter of 2024, the AAP govt had floated the plan again but later alleged that it was not getting enough support or backing from the Centre.",The delhi cabinet had on may 7 okayed a proposal to conduct five cloud-seeding trials.

KOLKATA: A law student of a south Kolkata college was allegedly gang-raped at the campus security guards' room on Wednesday evening after being offered a key union post.Read also: ‘Always a troublemaker’: Kolkata 'gang-rape' accused Manojit Mishra was ousted from Trinamool unit in 2021; got college seat despite limit Cops arrested three persons — college alumnus and ad-hoc staff Manojit Mishra and current students Pramit Mukherjee and Zaib Ahmed — after a medical test on the survivor corroborated her complaint.Mishra was thrown out of the college's Trinamool unit in 2021 and graduated in 2022, after which he started practising law.He, however, returned to the college recently as an ad-hoc non-teaching staff member.First-year student Mukherjee and second-year student Ahmed are known to be close aides of Mishra.

They took me to the guards' room forcefully, undressed me and raped me,"" her complaint said, adding that the accused recorded videos of the act and threatened to circulate them if she went to cops.She tried to fight back and escape but was hit with a hockey stick, she said.She was allowed to leave only after she complained she was having a panic attack and was short of breath.She pleaded that they take her to a hospital, a request that was denied; but she was allowed to use the inhaler she had in her bag, she added.She was finally allowed to leave around 10.50 pm, when she called her father who came and took her home.The woman lodged the complaint with Kasba cops on Thursday. ""The preliminary medical examination was done at Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital,"" joint commissioner of police (crime & traffic) Rupesh Kumar said, adding that witnesses had been examined and their statements recorded. Additional commissioner of police Santosh Pandey and South Suburban Division deputy commissioner Bidisha Kalita visited the scene of crime on Friday evening.Mishra and Ahmed were arrested around 7.30 p.m. on Thursday near the Kasba P.S.; Mukherjee was arrested from his residence just after midnight on Friday. Cops have seized the trio's mobile phones, suspecting the sexual assault may have been filmed, and have secured the crime scene for forensic investigation. The accused were produced at Alipore court on Friday and sent to police custody till July 1. ""The medical evidence corroborates the woman's version,"" public prosecutor Sourin Ghosal submitted in court.The principal of the college said the college could not evade responsibility though the incident happened more than three hours after classes gave over. Calcutta University vice-chancellor Santa Datta De said the college teacher-in-charge had been asked to submit a detailed report and the university would set up a fact-finding committee by Tuesday.Kolkata Police later issued a social media statement, commending the local police station's ""swift and decisive response"" to the complaint.""The investigation is being pursued with seriousness, professionalism and sensitivity. We appeal to the public and digital platforms to refrain from circulating unverified or misleading content that could hinder the judicial process and compromise the dignity of the survivor,"" it added.","A law student of a south kolkata college was allegedly gang-raped at the campus security guards' room.

In India, health insurance is generally often an afterthought, something you purchase for tax benefits, or workplace compliance. And many of us assume that having a policy means being protected. Sure, there’s protection, but is it enough?Imagine this scenario: a family member is hospitalised, and there’s a comforting thought:But as bills arrive, comfort gives way to confusion. There are deductions for choosing a certain room, charges for procedures that aren’t included, and diagnostic costs that must be paid out of pocket. Suddenly, what looked like full protection feels anything but that.This isn’t just one person’s story, it’s increasingly common. And it raises a critical question: is your health insurance truly designed for the way healthcare works today?Healthcare has evolved dramatically over the last decade. There are more treatment options, earlier interventions, and a broader focus on prevention and recovery. With that has come a rise in costs, even for everyday care.Yet not all insurance plans have kept pace. While many policies offer a dependable foundation, some still have limitations that can leave policyholders exposed.Let’s take a closer look at what this means in real life.Imagine your policy has a room rent cap of ₹4,000. You’re admitted to a hospital and opt for a private room that exceeds the cap by ₹1,000 a day. Because of this, your entire claim; doctor’s fees, medicines, procedures, and tests; is reimbursed at only 80-90% on the claim.That one small upgrade leads to proportionally lower payouts across your bill. Plus, non-medical items like admission kits and registration fees aren’t covered; leaving you to cover the gap out of your pocket.These are part of your everyday healthcare journey. Having a policy that covers it all is crucial.Out-of-pocket healthcare spending in India continues to be high. Even with insurance, individuals often bear a significant share of healthcare costs.As health needs become more complex, insurance cover should reflect that shift. A good comprehensive health plan is structured around how people actually seek and receive care across hospitals, clinics and homes.Take, for example, a couple planning a family. A comprehensive plan would ensure maternity benefits are accessible, newborn care is covered from day one, and even vaccinations are included in the first year.Similarly, someone undergoing surgery should have access to pre-operative diagnostics, a second opinion if needed, and rehabilitation support post-discharge.A coverage that supports the entire spectrum, from pre-hospitalisation to post-recovery, secures both health and finances. A thoughtfully designed health policy not only responds to illness but anticipates life’s medical milestones. These features are what define meaningful coverage:Covering medical expenses before admission and after discharge helps manage the full treatment arc.Especially valuable for critical illnesses, this provides clarity and confidence before proceeding further.If the full coverage amount is used, it’s automatically restored for future use in the same year.Often overlooked, certain policies offer support for acute dental or eye-related treatments.Good comprehensive plans cover both the recipient’s treatment and the donor’s hospitalisation, including complications.Some plans offer home care; useful for post-surgery recovery, chronic illnesses or conditions that require clinical supervision without hospitalisation.For couples facing fertility challenges, some plans offer financial support for assisted reproductive procedures, helping make parenthood more accessible.Covers delivery expenses (normal or caesarean), congenital conditions, and early vaccinations for your baby.If recommended for obesity-related health issues like diabetes or cardiac risks, this is included after a waiting period.Some health plans now reward healthy habits with wellness points that are redeemable for renewal discounts.Select plans also include free expert teleconsultations and AI-based face scan to track vitals making preventive care digital-first and accessible.Regular check-ups are often included as part of the cover, encouraging preventive care and early detection of potential health issues.If you’re unsure whether your plan is truly comprehensive, use this checklist.It’s easy to treat health insurance as a box to tick. But when life takes a turn what matters is whether your cover holds up. Taking the time to reassess your plan is not only prudent, but essential. The right cover is the one that stands by you through the full spectrum of health: hospital, home, recovery, and beyond.That’s why it helps to go with an insurer that has seen it all. With over 19 years of experience and 1 crore+ claims settled, STAR Health has shaped its policies around the realities people face every day.Because in healthcare, the true cost is not what you pay for a policy; It’s what you pay when your policy falls short.","Maternity care often comes with a long waiting period or may not be included at all.

NEW DELHI/PATNA: Disregarding opposition parties' protests against its move to conduct a special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar - requiring submission of citizenship proof by electors enrolled after 2003 - Election Commission has started the exercise in the state's 243 constituencies, with 98,450 booth level officers set to conduct door-to-door verification over the next one month.EC will treat the state's 2003 electoral roll - which has listed 4.9 crore electors - as probative evidence of eligibility, including pres-umption of Indian citizenship unless it receives any input otherwise.Also read: Bihar drive: EC to refer illegals for action under Citizenship Act Any person whose name is not recorded in the 2003 roll will be required to submit from among a set of 11 eligible government documents to establish his/her eligibility as an elector.

To justify the timing, EC sources said Section 21(2)(a) of Representation of the People Act, 1950, and Rule 25 of Registration of Elector Rules, 1961, make revision of electoral roll mandatory before every election/byelection, unless otherwise directed by EC for reasons to be recorded in writing.Also read: EC defends special voter roll revision amid oppn protests EC's statement on pursuing SIR in Bihar as per schedule, came a day after opposition INDIA bloc's members criticised the timing of the revision and alleged that the exercise was a veiled attempt to disenfranchise sections of the electorate in order to favour the ruling alliance.

"‘Misogyny cuts across party lines’: Mohua Moitra reacts after TMC distances from Kalyan, Mitra remarks on Kolkata gang-rape case; Banerjee 'disagrees'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/misogyny-cuts-across-party-lines-mohua-moitra-reacts-after-tmc-distances-from-kalyan-mitra-remarks-on-kolkata-gang-rape-case-banerjee-disagrees/articleshow/122133090.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Trinamool Congress on Saturday publicly distanced itself from party MP Kalyan Banerjee and MLA Madan Mitra over their controversial remarks on the Kolkata law college gang-rape case, prompting Banerjee to hit back at the party’s statement, saying a ""moral and intellectual alignment"" was lacking.In an official post on X, the party said, “The remarks made by MP Kalyan Banerjee and MLA Madan Mitra concerning the heinous crime at South Calcutta Law College were made in their personal capacities. The party unequivocally disassociates itself from their statements and strongly condemns the same.”Backing the party’s statement, TMC MP Mahua Moitra wrote on X: “Misogyny in India cuts across party lines. What differentiates @AITCofficial is that we condemn these disgusting comments no matter who makes them.”However, the party's censure prompted a sharp response from Kalyan Banerjee, who posted a strongly worded reply on X, questioning the party's moral clarity. “Completely disagree with the post made by @AITCofficial on X. Are they indirectly supporting the leaders who are shielding these criminals? Mere academic statements won't bring any real change unless immediate action is taken against those leaders directly responsible,” he wrote.Banerjee further said, “What's even more unfortunate is that some of the leaders who emerged after 2011 are themselves under question in such crimes. I also wish to clearly distance myself from those who are encouraging or protecting these criminals. To truly understand the intent behind my words and statements, a certain level of moral and intellectual alignment is required — which, unfortunately, seems to be missing. ”Meanwhile, Banerjee also took a veiled swipe at sections within his own party, alleging that some leaders who rose to prominence after 2011 were themselves facing serious allegations. “What’s even more unfortunate is that some of the leaders who emerged after 2011 are themselves under question in such crimes,” he said.The backlash followed remarks made by Banerjee on Friday when he said, “What can be done if a friend rapes his friend? Will the police be there in schools? This was done by students to another student. Who will protect her?” While he maintained that the accused should be arrested, his comments were widely criticised for appearing to shift responsibility away from the perpetrators.Earlier in the day, TMC MLA Madan Mitra also sparked outrage for blaming the survivor. “If someone calls you when the college is closed, then don't go. If she had taken a friend or informed someone, this wouldn’t have happened,” he had said.The alleged gang-rape took place on June 25 at South Calcutta Law College. The 24-year-old complainant accused three men - Manojit Mishra, Pramit Mukherjee, and Zaib Ahmed - of taking her to a guard’s room, raping her, recording the assault, and threatening to leak the video. She said she was confined for over three hours and was hit with a hockey stick when she resisted.All three accused were arrested within 24 hours. Mishra, a former Trinamool Chhatra Parishad office-bearer, was working at the college on a temporary staff contract and is a practising lawyer. The college’s security guard, Pinaki Banerjee, has also been arrested. The accused are in police custody until July 1, and a Special Investigation Team (SIT) has been set up.The National Commission for Women (NCW) has taken suo motu cognisance of the incident and demanded a time-bound probe. The BJP, meanwhile, has launched an attack on chief minister Mamata Banerjee, with senior leaders demanding her resignation and accusing the state government of failing to protect women.","The trinamool congress publicly distanced itself from party mp kalyan banerjee and mla madan mitra over their controversial remarks on the kolkata law college gang-rape case.

NEW DELHI: TMC leader Madan Mitra on Saturday, while defending his party, appeared to blame the victim in the Kolkata law college gang-rape case, saying, ""If someone calls you when the college is closed, then don't go. ""Addressing reporters in North 24 Parganas, the former West Bengal minister said the incident sent a message to girls about caution.“If that girl had not gone there, this wouldn't have happened. If she had informed someone before going or had taken a couple of friends with her, then this wouldn't have happened,” he said.He further added, “The one who committed this dirty deed took advantage of the situation.”Mitra also attempted to distance the party from the accused, saying, “TMC is a big party. Someone or the other is associated with Trinamool everywhere... We get our photos taken with everyone, but what's inside a person, only a psychologist can tell.”MP Kalyan Banerjee on Friday also triggered a controversy by saying, “What can be done if a friend rapes his friend?”Banerjee questioned the role of police in such incidents and added, “Will the police be there in schools?

A few men commit this type of crime.”His remarks came even as the alleged gang-rape of the 24-year-old law student continues to trigger public outrage and political backlash in West Bengal. The incident, which took place inside the premises of South Calcutta Law College, has drawn comparisons to the earlier RG Kar case, reviving grim memories of systemic lapses.According to the student’s police complaint, she was raped by three men — Manojit Mishra, a former Trinamool Chhatra Parishad office-bearer now working on an ad hoc teaching assignment, and two junior students, Pramit Mukherjee and Zaib Ahmed. She alleged that the trio forced her into the college guard room, undressed and gang-raped her, filmed the assault, and threatened to leak the footage if she approached police.“When I resisted, one of them hit me with a hockey stick,” she said. “I touched his feet, but he did not let me go.” She also reported that she was confined for over three hours and suffered a panic attack. The assailants only allowed her to use an inhaler, denying her further help.All three accused were arrested within 24 hours. Later, the college security guard, Pinaki Banerjee, was also held. A five-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed by Kolkata Police to probe the case. The accused have been remanded to police custody till July 1.The National Commission for Women (NCW) has taken suo motu cognisance of the incident and has demanded a time-bound investigation under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. BJP national president JP Nadda has also constituted a four-member inquiry team comprising Satpal Singh, Meenakshi Lekhi, Biplab Deb and Manan Mishra to visit the college and submit a detailed report.Meanwhile, BJP leaders across Bengal have mounted pressure on chief minister Mamata Banerjee. “This incident reveals the character of TMC and their thoughts towards women.
