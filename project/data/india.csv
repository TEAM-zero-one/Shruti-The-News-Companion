Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.Among the many couplets of Thirukkural on human connections, one stands out - friendships not swayed by emotions but steadied by clarity and enduring grace.The wise remain firm in friendships that neither blossom nor wither with time—unlike a flower that opens and closes its petals.Most of us know what it means to lose a friend; not with a dramatic rupture, but in the quiet drift of time. Bonds that once felt like lifelines slowly unravel. At times, life simply steers us in different directions. Sharp disagreements leave bruises. Or a shadow of a doubt — was something said behind one’s back— leads to a faltering of trust.I’ve had friends who were once the heartbeat of my days, now reduced to strangers. When we cross paths, it’s like walking through a museum of memories; echoes everywhere, but no one speaks. Some recollections are warm, others cut deep. The sting of betrayal resurfaces, uninvited. In those moments, I tell myself: You have to let people go. At some point, you see who truly mattered, who never did, and whose chapter in your story is simply over. They no longer belong to yours now.And yet, some friendships defy time, disagreement, and distance. Not because they are effortless, but because they are chosen, again and again, despite the friction.A shining example is that of Thiru V Kalyanasundaram (Thiru V Ka), the Tamil scholar and trade union pioneer. His friend and contemporary, M C Raja, was one of the earliest leaders of the Justice party. Both were reformers and thinkers, classmates and colleagues at Wesley College, and residents of Royapettah in Chennai.In 1921, the Binny Mill strike rattled the city. Thiru V Ka and Raja found themselves on opposing sides, not as enemies, but as leaders representing different groups of workers with diverging ideological paths.As tensions rose, whispers emerged that Thiru V Ka might be targeted, by police or angry factions. One day, a car halted at his door. Raja stepped out. “Trouble is on its way. Just get in,” he said.Thiru V Ka declined. But he never forgot the tears he saw in his friend’s eyes.Later, as the storm passed, Raja said something that stayed with him: Our friendship was strong enough to find harmony in the heart of conflict.Eventually, Raja moved to Alandur, and the rhythm of their friendship faltered.Another story, equally poignant, unfolded in 1933, again in Chennai. The newly formed Music Academy announced a dance performance by Rajalakshmi and Jeevarathnam—women from the devadasi community. The event was organised by E Krishna Iyer, then secretary of the Academy and a passionate cultural activist.At the time, Muthulakshmi Reddy was leading a fierce campaign to abolish the devadasi system, determined to restore dignity and civil rights to the women trapped within it. Krishna Iyer, while agreeing on the need for reform, argued that sadir—the classical dance form—should be preserved. To him, it was art, unjustly condemned by its social associations.The two began an intense public debate, exchanging letters through newspapers. Madras society split down the middle: some backed Reddy, others Krishna Iyer. Yet despite their differences, the two remained family friends, sharing stages, events, and mutual respect.In time, both found success. Reddy’s legislation helped abolish the devadasi system. Krishna Iyer, aided by Rukmini Devi Arundale, revived the art under a new name—Bharatanatyam—transforming it into a respected cultural treasure.Thiru V Ka and Raja. Krishna Iyer and Muthulakshmi Reddy. Four people divided by ideology, united by something deeper. Their friendships endured—not in the absence of disagreement, but because they held space for it. They lived what Thiruvalluvar wrote: relationships that neither bloom in prosperity nor wither in dissent.Not all of us are fortunate to have such enduring bonds. But perhaps the true test of friendship isn’t how brightly it blooms—but whether it survives when the petals fall.","Thirukkural with the times explores real-world lessons from the classic tamil text.

Yes, with improved security and trust No, recovery will take much longer

PAHALGAM: On a relatively warm May morning, Mohit Kumar stands beside an empty table at a Pahalgam restaurant, his eyes locked on the road in the hope of sighting a potential customer.Until a month ago, the 38-year-old native of UP’s Bijnor would barely get time to glance outside as he and 21 others waiting tables at the restaurant served customers filing in and out all day.The silence at Poonam Restaurant tells the story of what’s changed in a month at J&K’s Pahalgam since terror struck at Baisaran meadow on April 22.""We called Pahalgam ‘Mini India’,"" said Mohit, one among 14 waiters at the restaurant still holding on to their jobs. “We were among the first restaurants to open, confident that tourism in these parts would only grow bigger. Now, the situation is such that not even Kashmiris visit Pahalgam.”Muhammad Tasneem, who owns Poonam Restaurant, is banking on the next festive season to resurrect Pahalgam’s flagging tourism sector. “Hopefully, the tourist footfall will increase during Diwali. We have seen the worst over the past three decades, and hopefully this too shall pass.It takes a lot of time to build trust.”In the mid-90s, Tasneem’s father Mustafa, whose roots are in Bijnor, rented the place and set up shop with employees mostly from his hometown.A few metres from the restaurant, Darshan Ram, 18, sells wooden key holders, key chains, pen boxes, and toy shikaras inscribed with “I love Kashmir” or “Gift from Kashmir”. Before the meadow massacre, Darshan’s family would earn between Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 a day selling souvenirs.“In the past 10 days, I haven’t sold anything,” he told TOI on Thursday.Darshan landed in J&K from Rajasthan this Feb with his parents and two siblings. When he saw Pahalgam, it was love at first sight. “It was going well for us. Now, we don’t know how to survive if the situation doesn’t return to normal.”Srinagar native Nawaz, who runs Kashmir Arts Emporium, cleans the outlet and waits all day for customers who never turn up. “I have been doing this for the past three weeks, praying each new day would mark a change. Most shops are shut, but I am not giving up yet,” the 37-year-old said.At Hotel Heevan Pahalgam, nestled on the banks of the Lidder, Asif Iqbal Burza wears a despondent look as he speaks of how one brazen act of violence destroyed so many lives, livelihoods and Pahalgam’s reputation.Burza, who led a protest against terrorism after the April 22 killings, said his phone wouldn’t stop ringing in the aftermath of the attack as families and friends of guests at the hotel called to enquire about their safety.Also read: One month since Pahalgam attack: How India has punished, isolated Pakistan since April 22 He remains hopeful that tourists will return. “Pahalgam holds countless memories for so many people, it belongs to everyone,” he said.At the entrance to the hotel, a collage of photographs featuring actors Dharmendra, Hema Malini, Shah Rukh Khan, Anushka Sharma and other celebrities reminds visitors of Pahalgam’s enduring connection with cinema and popular culture.“People have deep emotional ties to this place,” Burza said. “They will return and, together, we will defeat the designs of those who aim to destroy tourism here.”The few tourists who have visited Pahalham since the terrorist attack have mostly spent time along the picture-perfect riverbank. All parks in Pahalgam and nearby destinations such as Betaab Valley, Aru Valley, Chandanwari, Lidderwat, Sheshnag, Tulian Lake and the Kolhai Glacier have been closed for visitors and tourists.A Chennai resident visiting Pahalgam along with 11 members of his extended family said he planned the trip three months ago. “I didn’t postpone it even after the terrorist attack as I expected security to be in place. I was right. The parks are shut, but the riverside is pretty,” he said.Hotel operators said the Amarnath Yatra, beginning July 3, could potentially be the start of a resurgence in tourism in these parts and pick up further during the autumnal festivities.","Pahalgam, j&k's tourist hub, has been hit hard by the april 22 terrorist attack.

JAIPUR: Sixteen days after Supreme Court dismissed Rajasthan BJP MLA Kanwarlal Meena's appeal and two days after his surrender, assembly Speaker Vasudev Devnani finally disqualified the governing party's legislator on Friday.The move came hours after Congress filed a contempt petition against Devnani in Rajasthan high court for allegedly delaying action against Kanwarlal Meena , sentenced to three years for intimidating a govt officer at gunpoint during a panchayat bypoll in 2005.Devnani defended the timing of his decision, stating his office acted upon receiving a formal legal opinion from the advocate-general on Friday. ""I do not act under any pressure. Every decision is rooted in legal and constitutional principles. Even in past cases, Speakers took time for due diligence,"" Devnani said.Opposition Congress, however, cited examples of Rahul Gandhi being disqualified from Lok Sabha within 24 hours of his conviction in 2023 and Rajasthan BSP MLA BL Kushwaha being disqualified within two days of his conviction in 2016. Congress accused Devnani of having deliberately delayed disqualification of Meena and acting only after the contempt petition was filed, attributing the final outcome to its sustained pressure.""The Speaker acted only to avoid further embarrassment in the high court,"" state opposition leader Tikaram Jully of Congress said.Meena has been disqualified from May 1 when the HC upheld a trial court's three-year sentence to him. Meena had then approached the apex court for relief but it dismissed his plea on May 7 citing the legislator's extensive criminal record.The disqualification has reduced BJP's strength in the 200-member assembly from 119 to 118 and necessitates a bypoll in Anta, Meena's assembly seat in Baran district, within six months.

The decision violated Rule 12 of the Aircrafts Security Rules, 2023, rendering it invalid. The rule stipulates that govt must provide an entity an opportunity to present its case before suspending security clearance. Any suspension requires documented justification and cannot exceed one year.Cancellation is permitted only on reasonable grounds of national security, civil aviation security, or over non-compliance with security conditions.Rohatgi contended that Centre was not endowed with plenary powers, as it claimed to, and it was not open for govt to say it could be in breach of its own rules of granting an opportunity of hearing while revoking security clearance.Celebi urged the HC not to examine materials provided to it in a sealed cover until the firm was given a gist of the allegations it faced. Emphasising the firm ought to have been put on notice before govt's action, Rohatgi said: ""Notice has to say the proposed punishment based on the gravamen of the facts... In a given case you can redact some information...something I should know, or should I argue from newspapers?... Give me a gist of allegations.

CBI officer who exposed railway scam in 1993 shot with arrow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cbi-officer-who-exposed-scam-shot-with-arrow/articleshow/121370686.cms,"LUCKNOW: A Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officer in Lucknow's Hazratganj on Friday had to pay a hefty price for uncovering a railway scam in 1993 - when an iron-tipped traditional arrow pierced his chest in broad daylight.The incident occurred around 11:15am at the main gate of the CBI office located on Naval Kishore Road, Hazratganj - one of Lucknow's busiest areas.Eyewitnesses were stunned as a man emerged from behind a tree, aimed a wooden bow, and released an iron-tipped arrow directly at CBI ASI Virendra Singh, piercing his chest and knocking him to the ground.The accused, identified as Dinesh Murmu, a former railway employee from Khadagpur, Munger district in Bihar, was immediately overpowered by onlookers and handed over to police.Sources said that Murmu nursed a grudge for over three decades after losing his job in a 1993 CBI-led railway trap case that Singh helped investigate.Murmu is reportedly from a tribal community and worked as a junior employee in Indian Railways.After his dismissal, he returned to his village and largely lived off the grid. Preliminary questioning suggests that he spent months preparing for the attack and may have even practised using the weapon in isolated forested areas.According to police, the attacker used a handmade wooden bow and a sharpened metal arrow, reportedly crafted specifically for the assault. He waited behind a tree near the CBI gate, timing the attack for maximum impact as Singh stood momentarily alone. Singh was rushed to Lucknow's civil hospital with a 5cm wound to the left side of his chest.Chief medical superintendent Dr Rajesh Srivastava confirmed that Singh was in a stable condition and under continuous observation. ""If the arrow struck just slightly to the right, it could have pierced a major artery or even the heart,"" he said.CBI officers are also reviewing whether Singh received any threats in recent months, or if there were signs of surveillance prior to the attack.","A central bureau of investigation (cbi) officer in lucknow's hazratganj had to pay a hefty price for uncovering a railway scam in 1993.

Govt on Waqf Act in SC: Proof of being Muslim in sync with Sharia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-on-waqf-act-in-sc-proof-of-being-muslim-in-sync-with-sharia/articleshow/121348573.cms,"No mention of 'waqf by user' term in 1923 Act: Raj govt to SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its verdict on the ambit, contours and necessity of an interim order after arguments over three days between the Centre and petitioners for and against the validity of Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra. Responding to the petitioners' objection to the provision that only a practising Muslim for five years could dedicate properties for waqf, SG Tushar Mehta said it was in sync with the requirement of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937.Given the widespread misuse of waqf properties and their usurpation for personal purposes noted from 1870s, registration of waqf properties, including 'waqf by user', needed to be mandatorily registered under the 1923 and 1995 Waqf Acts, he said. Mehta said a person could be governed by the 1937 Act only if he satisfied the prescribed authority that he was a Muslim and filled a form before that authority declaring that he desired to follow Sharia law and be governed by its provisions - ranging from marriage to waqfs. ""So, what is the problem in the new law asking a person to be mandatorily a Muslim for the purpose of making a waqf?"" he asked.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, supported by A M Singhvi, Rajeev Dhavan and Huzefa Ahmadi, said the way the new waqf law was drafted, it would allow govt to take over 'waqf by user' properties, which were not registered for decades because of fault of state govts, an eventuality which would result in punishing the community for no fault of its.Sibal said waqf was part of zakat, one of the 5 cardinal principles intrinsic to Islam. ""Waqf was purely religious, and no authority could interfere in this as the Constitution guarantees that every religious denomination has the absolute right to manage its religious institutions, which in this case is waqf,"" he added.Appearing for Rajasthan, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said 'waqf by user' was a term evolved by Privy Council and did not find mention in the 1923 Waqf Act. There was no dedication to Allah in case of 'waqf by user', he said. For ST Muslim organisation, Odisha, and a waqf board, senior advocates Ranjit Kumar, Maninder Singh and Gopal Sankaranarayanan supported Centre's stand.An advocate brought to the court's notice that in Tamil Nadu's Tiruchendurai, its 1,500-year-old Chola-era temple and the surrounding area had been declared waqf property by TN waqf board. She said the board's claim was met with resistance from villagers, who were unable to sell their land without the board's approval. She said the new law would curb such practices.","No mention of 'waqf by user' term in 1923 act: raj govt to sc.
