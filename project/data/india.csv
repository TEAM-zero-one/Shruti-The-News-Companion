'You reap what you sow'

Chirag tries to meet Paras, but fails

How will the BJP react?

'I have saved the party'

NEW DELHI: In a surprise turn of events, Chirag Paswan , the president of Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) founded by his father late Ram Vilas Paswan , was on Monday unceremoniusly unseated as the leader of the party in Lok Sabha.Chirag, who took over the mantle of the party in 2020 after the death of Ram Vilas Paswan, stood completely isolated at the top within his party.Five of the six members of Parliament of the LJP revolted against Chirag in an overnight coup and elected Pashupati Kumar Paras, his uncle, as the new leader of the party in Lok Sabha.Besides Pashupati Paras, the rebel group includes Chirag's cousin Prince Raj, Chandan Singh, Veena Devi and Mehboob Ali Kaiser.The group has already met Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to inform him about the changes in the party. In the coming days, the rebels may stake claim in the Election Commission to represent the real LJP and could also move to oust Chirag from the top party post. Nitish Kumar 's party, the Janta Dal (United), reacted with a sense of vindication to the deveopments within the LJP.Chirag had led an aggressive anti-Nitish Kumar campaign in the 2020 assembly elections and in the process dealt a heavy political blow to the ruling Janta Dal (United) inChirag walked out of the NDA in the state and contested the assembly elections against Nitish Kumar's party. He fielded nominees, some of them BJP rebels, against all the JD(U) candidates.As a result, the JD(U) ended up losing several seats due to triangular contest and for the first time it became the junior partner to the BJP in Bihar NDA.Little wonder, Nitish Kumar's party reacted with a dig at the developments within the LJP.""You reap what you sow,"" said JD(U)national president RCP Singh as he blamed Chirag for doing negative politics.""Chirag Paswan has committed so many blunders in the recent past. The people of Bihar and his own party workers and leaders were not happy with whatever he did during the Bihar assembly election. Now, it's results are coming in the form of a split in the party,"" Singh said.Given the bitter political rivalry between the two parties since the 2020 assembly elections, sources close to Chirag Paswan accused the JD(U) for the split in the LJP.The JD(U), on the other hand, blamed Chirag Paswan's negative politics for the rift within his party.The lone LJP MLA in the Bihar assembly has already left the party to join the JD(U).As the events unfolded on Monday, Chirag Paswan drove to his uncle's residence in the national capital to meet him and Prince Raj.Paswan, who has not been keeping well for some time, waited for over 20 minutes in his car before he was let into the house and then left after spending more than an hour inside.He left without saying a word to waiting media persons.It is believed that neither of the two rebel MPs met him. A household help said the two were not at home when the LJP chief arrived.It would be interesting to see as to how the BJP reacts to the latest developments in this game of one-upmanship between the JD(U) and the LJP in Bihar.Chirag Paswan has all along kept a very strong pro-BJP and pro-PM Modi stand and announced ahead of assembly elections that he is working for a BJP government in Bihar.Pashupati Paras, on the other hand, is percieved as pro-Nitish Kumar.Paras today lauded Nitish Kumar as a good leader and ""vikas purush"" (development-oriented man).With talks of Union Cabinet reshuffle, it would be interesting to see if the BJP decides to include Chirag Paswan to ensure that he is not completely marginalised within his own party.The JD(U) has declined to comment on speculations about one or more rebel LJP MPs being inducted into the Union cabinet from the party quota or getting accommodated in the state ministry.However, it has reiterated the party stand that all NDA allies ought to get a ""respectable"" share at the Centre.Pashupati Paras, who is an MP from Hajipur, a seat represented by Ram Vilas Paswan for several years, caimed that 99 per cent of LJP workers were unhappy with the leadership of Chirag Paswan in Bihar.""There are six MPs in our party. It was the desire of five MPs to save our party. So, I have not broken the party. I have saved it. Chirag Paswan is my nephew as well as the party's national president. I have no objection against him,"" Paras said when asked about the developments.Paras said his group will continue to be part of the BJP-led NDA, and added that Paswan can remain in the organisation.Regarding the rumours that LJP will be joining the Janta Dal (United) in Bihar, the Hajipur MP said, ""Existence of LJP will continue, we are not joining JDU. We will fulfill the ambition of Late Ramvilas Paswan.""",Lok janshakti party (ljp) chief chirag paswan failed to meet pashupati kumar paras at his house in new delhi.

Single dose of Covid-19 vaccine sufficient for already infected people: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/single-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-sufficient-for-already-infected-people-study/articleshow/83513073.cms,"HYDERABAD: A single dose of Covid-19 vaccine is sufficient for an infected person as there was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection, according to a study released by AIG Hospitals on Monday.The city-based AIG Hospitals recently published a study conducted on 260 healthcare workers, who got vaccinated between January 16 and February 5, in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases (a peer-reviewed journal).The study was designed to assess the immunological memory response in all those patients.All patients were given the Covishield vaccine.The study also said Memory T-cell responses elicited by a single dose of vaccine were significantly higher in the previously infected group compared with those who had no prior infection.Commenting on the impact that this study can have on the overall vaccine administration strategy, Dr. D Nageshwar Reddy , Chairman, AIG Hospitals, and one of the co-authors of the study, said the results show that people who got infected with Covid-19 need not take two doses of vaccine as a single dose can develop robust antibody and memory cell response at par with two-doses for those who didnt get the infection.This will significantly help at a time when theres a shortage of vaccine in the country and more people can be covered using the saved doses, Dr Reddy said.Once the requisite number of people are vaccinated for achieving herd immunity, these patients who got infected and received only one dose can take the second dose of the vaccine, he further said.At this point, all our strategies should be directed at the widespread distribution of available vaccines and to include the maximum number of people at least with a single dose, Dr Reddy added.",A single dose of covid-19 vaccine is sufficient for an infected person.

"Bihar polls: My age may be young, but my promise is mature, says Tejashwi Yadav",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-my-age-may-be-young-but-my-promise-is-mature-says-tejashwi-yadav/articleshow/125009260.cms,"Tejashwi Yadav (ANI)

As the Bihar assembly election campaign intensifies, INDIA bloc’s chief ministerial candidate, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, lays out his vision for development, employment and economic justice while taking aim at his political rivals.

He shares his plans to create jobs, strengthen the economy and build an inclusive Bihar with TOI’s AlokKNMishra. Excerpts:

You are the chief ministerial candidate of the INDIA bloc and have been campaigning extensively across Bihar for the past several weeks. What promises are you making to people, and what feedback are you getting?

“My Age May Be Young, But My Promise Is Mature,” Says Tejashwi Yadav Ahead of Bihar Polls

You have pledged to provide a govt job for every family. Critics argue that this may not be financially feasible for Bihar, which does not have the financial resources to fund this. How do you plan to implement this promise?

Have you consulted experts, carried out any study or prepared a blueprint for this?

The INDIA bloc and the NDA are both contesting the election on the development plank. How is the RJD-led alliance’s development plank different from the NDA's?

Having served as deputy chief minister under Nitish Kumar, what do you think about Nitish Kumar's style of leadership and the way he runs the Government?

RJD has traditionally relied on support from the Muslim-Yadav vote base. This time, you have fielded more candidates from women, Dalits, and EBC communities. How is the RJD attempting to broaden its appeal beyond the MuslimYadav combination?

The voting patterns in recent Bihar elections indicate that a larger share of EBC, upper-caste and several groups within the Dalit community voters have favoured the NDA over the RJD

Women in Bihar have traditionally been seen as strong supporters of Nitish Kumar. What strategies is the RJD adopting to attract more women voters in this election?

Do you think the women of Bihar are going to support the INDIA bloc this time?

The NDA is contesting the election under the leadership of Nitish Kumar, but it has not yet categorically announced that Nitish will be the CM if the NDA wins. What is your view on this?

Why will the NDA not make Nitish Kumar the CM?

RJD rule in Bihar ended 20 years ago. Even now, many people say that a return of the RJD to power could bring back the ‘jungle raj’ of the past. Why do such perceptions persist even after so many years since the RJD last governed Bihar?

You have been saying that Lalu Yadav gave social justice to the people of Bihar, and you will deliver economic justice. Can you elaborate?

There have been reports of internal differences within the INDIA bloc. How have you addressed or managed these challenges?

But across 11 se

ats, the INDIA bloc partners are contesting against each other in what is being described as a friendly fight.

Congress is an important partner of the RJD-led alliance in Bihar. It won 19 seats in 2020. How do you feel it is going to perform in this election?

Did you give any suggestions to Congress when they were finalising the tickets?

There seems to be tension in your family, with your elder brother’s newly formed party (Janshakti Janata Dal) contesting the election against many RJD candidates. As his younger brother, many would expect him to support you and stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this crucial time. How do you respond to this?

Is there any possibility of the RJD again aligning with Nitish Kumar’s party JD(U) in future?

How challenging is Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj for the INDIA bloc?

You are the INDIA bloc’s CM face. The VIP (Vikassheel Insaan Party) chief is the deputy chief minister face. Is there a possibility that there could be another deputy CM from the Muslim community?

We have taken an oath to make Bihar the number one state in the country and that is our ultimate objective. Our vision is to build a Bihar where no Bihari brother or sister has to migrate in search of work or opportunities. Every facility and opportunity should be available right here, in our own state. Bihar should have factories and job opportunities, as well as quality hospitals, colleges and universities.Factories should be set up, jute mills reopened, food processing units established and new IT parks and SEZs developed.Our goal is to make Bihar an educational hub so that students do not have to go to places like Kota to prepare for exams and we want to build good hospitals so that people do not have to travel outside the state for treatment. Bihar today is one of the poorest states with the lowest per capita income. We are determined to change that by ensuring that every citizen has access to education, healthcare, income, opportunities and justice – and that the govt is truly action-oriented.Bihar also has immense potential in the tourism sector – whether it is religious tourism, heritage tourism or general tourism. We want to develop this potential and promote Bihar as a major tourism destination. We want to make such a Bihar that moves ahead on the path of progress. We are getting a great response from the people who want a change in Bihar.Let the people say what they want to say. The last time, they were saying that giving 10 lakh jobs was impossible. Now, the same people – the BJP and JD(U) – have been forced to talk about jobs, and they are saying they will give one crore jobs. We have done and shown what we promised.We gave five lakh jobs – about 3.5 lakh every year during the 17 months from Aug 2022 to Jan 2024, when I served as deputy chief minister in the Grand Alliance govt. We also gave the status of Bihar govt employees to over four lakh contractual teachers in the state in Dec 2023. So, we have already done it, and soon we will turn this task – which looks impossible – into a possible one. My age may be young, but my promise is mature.We do not make any announcements without consulting the experts and without conducting the required research and study. We only make announcements that are feasible and practical. We have prepared the blueprint for it.The NDA has no development plank and no vision for Bihar. The BJP wants factories to be set up only in Gujarat – the semiconductor factory is in Gujarat, investor meetings are held there, SEZs are established there, and even the international stadium is built there.Everything is being done in Gujarat, while nothing is being done for Bihar. They have no road map or vision for Bihar. Amit Shah (union home minister) himself said that there is a dearth of land in Bihar, which is why factories and industries cannot be set up here. So, they have made it clear that they have no development plan for Bihar.At present, Nitish Kumar has been reduced to just a puppet. BJP is running the govt while Nitish Kumar is merely a figurehead – the real power lies with Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. We even have sympathy for Nitish Kumar, considering his current condition.This is the same Nitish Kumar who once snapped ties with the NDA after Narendra Modi was announced the chief of the BJP’s campaign committee for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. He had even cancelled a dinner planned for Modi in Patna. In the past, the same Nitish Kumar returned the Rs 5 crore Koshi flood relief donation from the Narendra Modi-led Gujarat govt in 2010 when the Gujarat govt issued advertisements for it.And now, Nitish ji has, unfortunately, become a puppet and his health condition also does not allow him to run the govt effectivelyThe RJD has always been a party for everyone – inclusive since the very beginning. No govt has given as much representation in the state cabinet to upper castes as the one led by Laluji. Similarly, no other govt has matched the number of leaders from the EBC category who were made MLAs, MLCs, and given various opportunities under the govt of Laluji.It was Laluji who made Bhagwati Devi, the daughter of the Musahar community, an MP. He ensured that every section of society received respect and representation in governance. Yes, some people may have left us at times, but eventually, all of them have come back — because they know that the RJD truly belongs to everyone.In the 2020 election, the difference between the NDA and the Mahagathbandhan was only 12,000 votes, which was less than 1%. It shows that we got votes from all sections of society.The women have woken up now. The truth has come out in the open – that women were often exploited and were denied the respect and rights they truly deserved. This is why there is a growing sense of dissatisfaction among women with the Nitish govt.See, due to growing dissatisfaction among women, the Nitish govt had to give a Rs 10,000 bribe to each woman just before the elections. They realised that their support base among women was drifting away, especially after we announced the ‘Mai Bahin Maan Yojana’ for the women of Bihar, under which women in Bihar will receive Rs 2,500 per month as financial assistance to make them financially independent, and we spoke about making Jeevika Didis permanent.This has clearly panicked the NDA. That is why they are giving out Rs 10,000 in the middle of the election, and yet the Election Commission is not stopping them. What is the emergency that justifies this?Amit Shah ji and the BJP are clear that Nitish Kumar will not become the chief minister again. It is totally clear. He will meet the same fate as Shinde ji (Eknath Shinde was not reinstated as CM after the BJP won a majority in the 2024 Maharashtra assembly elections).His situation is not the same. The BJP wants to have its own chief minister in Bihar because, until now, they have never had one. They aspire for it, but that ambition will never be fulfilled.See, this is nothing but complete propaganda and a wrong perception fuelled by those opposed to the RJD. Lalu ji always gave respect to everyone and worked to ensure equality in society. Those who considered themselves superior by birth had to sit at the same level as Dalits and backward communities. This created resentment among such people. True superiority comes from one’s actions, not from birth. Lalu ji made everyone equal and upheld this principle consistently.We are living in an economic age, and people deserve economic justice. Inflation is soaring, jobs are scarce, and household expenses are rising rapidly. How are people supposed to manage their daily lives? Since Modi came to power, under the NDA govt, everything has become more expensive.Modi ji had promised to bring down inflation, but prices have risen fivefold since he took office – fuel, food, and almost everything has become costlier, while people’s incomes remain stagnant. Small and medium-scale factories are shutting down, businesses are struggling and the economy is not growing as it should. The situation worsened further after Trump imposed tariffs. Now is the time to ensure true economic justice for the people.There were no fissures in the INDIA bloc. There was no problem. It was only in the media.The friendly fight is being conducted strategically. In Jharkhand, we contested and won elections despite similar arrangements. Likewise, in Jammu & Kashmir, the INDIA bloc had friendly fights, and they emerged victorious. In Bihar, the situation is no different. We remain united and strong, contesting the elections with our full strength, and we are going to win the elections.Congress will perform much better this time. We are confident of winning more seats compared to 2020, as we have focused carefully on the winnability factor and meticulously selected our candidates.We all sit together and discuss it – the selection of candidates.That’s alright. In a democracy, everyone has the right to form their own party and contest elections. Yes, it would have been far better if the things that happened had not happened, but this is the reality, and we have to accept it.Now, the Janata Dal (United) will not survive after the elections are over. Half of the JD(U) leaders will go to the BJP and half will come to the RJD.We do not care about such things – who is coming to Bihar, who is making what party. Our only focus is to make Bihar the number one state in the country. Our fight is against unemployment.It has already been announced that there will be one more deputy CM if the INDIA bloc forms the govt. When the right time comes, the decision about it will be taken collectively by the alliance partners and an announcement will be made.","Tejashwi prasad yadav is the chief ministerial candidate of the india bloc.

MUMBAI: Rohit Aarrya had doused the Powai studio with a petrol and rubber solution, threatening to set it ablaze if his demands were not met, according to the FIR filed by assistant police inspector Amol Waghmare, who entered the premises with three other cops to rescue the children and shot the captor in self defence after he “pointed to the pistol tucked in his waist at children’s side for a moment, and then pointed it towards me and my team, and he was about to fire”.Assistant police inspector Amol Waghmare, complainant in the hostage crisis, said in the FIR he reached the RA Studio complex around 2pm when chaos broke out. “A few parents rushed in, shouting that their children were not answering calls. Someone showed me a video circulating on WhatsApp — a man named Rohit Arryya claiming he had taken several children hostage inside the studio. He was threatening to burn the place down if anyone tried to intervene.Within minutes, police teams led by API Sohail Subedar and senior PI Sonawane reached the spot. The atmosphere was tense—parents were crying, and we could smell petrol from outside the studio. The accused doused the premises with a petrol and rubber solution, threatening to set it ablaze if his demands were not met. There were also batteries nearby. Police gained access through a duct and reached the first-floor bathroom where the children were confined.” TOI has a copy of the FIR.The children were kept hostage on the first floor. Waghmare along with sub-inspectors Rakesh Nalawade, Bade and Shinde entered through the bathroom window with the help of fire brigade. “We heard children crying in the bathroom.Then Rohit Aarrya entered and, leaving the children alone, at a distance of about two to three feet, he used a pepper spray, and then pointed to the pistol tucked in his waist... and was about to fire. To save myself, our team and children from being harmed, I fired a shot from my service pistol and he was injured. He was immediately taken to Jogeshwari trauma care hospital and the hostages were rescued and handed over to their parents. ”The FIR stated before the police team entered the studio, Rohan Aher who worked as assistant to Aarrya appeared at the window and told the cops that Aarrya had confined four children with ropes and put adhesive tapes on their mouths. “We saw a person from the window on the first floor saying his name was Rohit Aarrya and he started talking to us policemen. At that time, since his voice was not clear, Sonawane took his mobile number from one Amol Dorugade and called Aarrya on his mobile number. ” Aher is the key witness in the case, said the police.Cops requested him to release the children and promised to fulfil his demands. DCP Datta Nalawade called and tried to talk to him, but he was not stating clearly what his demand was. He threatened on phone that he would set the place on fire and may harm the children, the FIR said.","Aarrya poured petrol all over, pointed gun at kids and pointed it at cops.

'Paid Campaign': Nitin Gadkari Slams Criticism Of E20 Program; Calls It 'Politically Motivated'

Expansion and technology push

Environmental balance and logistics efficiency





NEW DELHI: In a unique move, the road transport ministry has directed the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and highway builders to create their own YouTube channels and upload regular videos of highway projects at various stages of construction.Union minister Nitin Gadkari said he has ordered the installation of hoardings with QR codes on national highways. Commuters will be able to scan these codes to view details of the contractor, consultant, and government officials responsible for the stretch, including their names and contact information.Gadkari said, “Main kyu gaali khaun? The QR code will have information of the contractor, consultant, and officers who cleared the road. If a road is bad and people are complaining about it on social media, take it seriously. From A to Z in road construction, we need ownership, sincerity, and a positive approach. Roads must be good, and they must stay good.”He emphasised that if people are paying toll, they deserve international-quality roads. “Weather or poor bitumen cannot be excuses. If the surface is not comfortable, fix it — cost may increase but comfort is non-negotiable,” Gadkari said.The minister also pushed for performance audits to identify design and maintenance lapses, promote accountability, and reward quality work. “When audits are regular, transparency increases, and excuses decrease. That’s how we should work,” he said.At the same event, road transport secretary V Umashankar on Tuesday instructed NHAI to upload such project videos for public viewing and feedback. Speaking at a CII event, he said, “We often get information and updates about projects and problems from videos uploaded by independent YouTubers. Some comments also give insight into issues. We are working to make video uploading part of project contract documents.”Officials said builders already submit drone-shot videos during construction, so making them public will not be an issue. The move aims to enhance transparency, accountability, and public participation in highway projects.Gadkari said work is underway to upgrade 25,000 km of highways to four lanes and connect major ports under a ₹2 lakh crore plan, highlighting that improved connectivity is also supporting religious tourism and adventure travel. The ministry is making precast technology mandatory in highway construction to enhance quality and speed up completion.Citing the transplantation of 8,500 trees along the Dwarka Expressway, Gadkari said the government is committed to balancing infrastructure growth with environmental sustainability.He added that improved road infrastructure will help reduce logistics and fuel costs, noting that “80% of goods traffic in India moves by road, while 18% uses other modes and only 1% by air. With better highways, logistics costs are expected to come down to single digits.”Reaffirming the government’s commitment, Gadkari said the goal is to build safe, sustainable, and modern roads that boost economic activity and improve the quality of life across India.","Nitin gadkari orders babus to put qr codes on highways with contractor and officers’ details.

NEW DELHI: Janata Dal (United) candidate and former Mokama MLA Anant Singh was arrested by the Patna Police on Saturday night in connection with the murder of Jan Suraaj Party worker Dularchand Yadav, the Patna senior superintendent of Police Kartikeya Sharma confirmed.Anant Singh has been arrested along with two associates, Manikant Thakur and Ranjit Ram, from Bedna village.According to officials, a massive police operation involving around 150 personnel was carried out at Singh’s residence in Barh, near Patna, late Saturday night. Singh, a well-known strongman in Bihar politics, was taken into custody and brought to Patna for interrogation. “Further details will be shared during a scheduled press conference at 1:30 am on Sunday,” the SSP said.SSP Patna, Kartikeya K Sharma said, ""... On 30 October, there was a clash between two groups of competing candidates. Stones were pelted resulting in injuries. A dead body was recovered after the incident. The deceased, Dularchand Yadav, aged 75 years, was a resident of the village where this clash occurred... Both sides registered cases, and police started investigating the case... Based on evidence, eyewitness accounts, and the postmortem report of the deceased, it appears that the Model Code of Conduct was violated, and it is a serious issue.It was found that all this happened in the presence of the candidate, Anant Singh, who is also the main accused in the case. Anant Singh has been arrested. His accomplices, Manikant Thakur and Ranjeet Ram, have also been arrested with him... All three will be presented before the magistrate, and due investigation will follow.""Patna DM Thiyagarajan SM said the incident was taken “very seriously.” The Model Code of Conduct will be enforced strictly, he said, adding that all licensed arms must be deposited during polls to ensure peaceful elections.The case pertains to the killing of former RJD leader Dularchand Yadav, who was attacked in the Mokama Tal area on Thursday afternoon while campaigning for Jan Suraaj’s candidate Piyush Priyadarshi. A violent clash reportedly erupted between rival groups, during which Yadav was shot by an unidentified assailant and later run over by a vehicle. The postmortem report released on Friday confirmed that his ribcage was crushed, suggesting he was run over after being shot.An FIR filed by Yadav’s grandson Neeraj Kumar named Anant Singh, his nephews Karamveer and Ranveer, and two others as accused. Police sources said further arrests may follow as the investigation continues.Reacting to the arrest, Jan Suraaj candidate Piyush Priyadarshi told ANI, “This is a good gesture, but it would have been good had they taken action sooner. Today, he was moving around in a convoy of 50 vehicles and even participated in election campaigning. When an FIR was registered against him, he should have been arrested sooner... But better late than never. What is important now is how the police investigate the whole case. .. It is a relief for his family.”Meanwhile, the Election Commission took strong action following the murder, ordering the replacement of the Patna Rural SP and Mokama returning officer, and initiating disciplinary proceedings against three officials for lapses. The poll panel directed the immediate suspension of SDPO Abhishek Singh and sought a compliance report by 12 noon on November 2, 2025.The Mokama Assembly seat, which votes on November 6, has long been notorious as a stronghold of powerful “bahubalis” who wield influence during elections. The killing of Yadav has intensified the political battle in Bihar, with opposition leaders, including RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, accusing the administration of failing to maintain law and order.","Janata dal (united) candidate and former mokama mla anant singh was arrested by the patna police on saturday night in connection with the murder of dularchand yadav.

Deadly Stampede at Andhra Pradesh After Chaos, Panic Strikes Venkateswara Temple, At Least 10 Dead

NEW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu on Saturday vowed strict action against those responsible for the deadly stampede in Venkateswara Swami Temple in Kasibugga.While addressing a gathering in Sri Sathya Sai district, CM Naidu accused the organisers of not informing the police or local authorities about the event.“It is extremely painful that innocent people lost their lives in the stampede.

NEW DELHI: As most sleeper coaches and long-haul buses remain outside the ambit of the mandatory Bus Body Code that came into effect in September 2025, providing an easy escape for operators and local transport authorities, the government is set to issue a mandatory checklist of safety features that regional transport offices (RTOs) must verify while renewing registration and fitness certificates.Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari this week held a meeting on the recent bus fire incidents in Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, and directed officials to take necessary steps, including writing to state govts for stricter enforcement and compliance of notified norms by transport departments.TOI has learnt that the checklist — aimed at preventing mishaps like fires and ensuring faster evacuation of passengers in emergencies — will include provisions such as a minimum 450 mm passageway, at least four emergency doors, fire-resistant electrical equipment and wiring, two fire extinguishers, a fire detection and suppression system (FDSS), and hammers at each berth to break glass windows during emergencies.Sources said other items on the checklist include provisions for fixing yellow reflective tapes along the edge of the passageway and retro-reflective tapes on all borders of the inside face of emergency doors.While several of these provisions — forming part of the Automotive Industry Standards — were notified in phases since 2016 and came into force after March 2017, their enforcement remains a challenge.Officials added that since these norms are already in place, and with additional requirements such as mandatory emergency lighting of the passageway and removal of partition doors between driver and passenger sections from July this year, these features can be included in the checklist for older buses when they come for fitness tests and renewal of registration.Compliance with the Bus Body Code was voluntary before Sept 2025, and RTOs granted permissions based on self-declarations submitted by body builders claiming adherence to the norms. However, from Sept onwards, all fully built buses with seating capacity exceeding 22 passengers require type approval from govt-recognised testing agencies, and self-certification is no longer permitted.Meanwhile, in an appeal, the Bus and Car Operators Confederation of India (BOCI) urged its members not to shy away from taking responsibility for fire incidents by giving lame excuses, but instead to take immediate corrective measures. “If we don’t take due care of passenger safety, the survival of private bus operations — and of sleeper coaches in general — will be at risk,” BOCI chief Prasanna Patwardhan said, appealing to members to adhere strictly to the Bus Body Code and ensure full compliance with all legal requirements.New model of buses & trucks to have Advanced Driver Assistance System from 2027All new model buses and trucks will need to have Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) from Oct 2027 and existing models will need them from Jan 2028. ADAS will include features such as automatic emergency braking system, driver drowsiness alert system and lane departure warning system. These changes aim to prevent crashes by alerting drivers and applying brakes if there is a delay in their response.",Most sleeper coaches and long-haul buses remain outside the ambit of the mandatory bus body code that came into effect in september 2025.

How a 94-yr-old man’s mini-Tirupati shrine turned into a site of death





SRIKAKULAM: A stampede at a privately run temple in Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh killed nine devotees - eight women and a 13-year-old boy - and left more than 25 injured Saturday morning, after a railing collapse on a narrow staircase caused panic in a crowd of over 20,000 gathered for Karthika Ekadashi. The toll may rise as the condition of some of the injured is critical.The Venkateswara Swamy temple, located at Kasibugga under Palasa mandal and modelled on the Tirumala shrine in Tirupati, was built by 94-year-old Hari Mukund Panda from Odisha and opened just four months ago. One gate serving both entry and exit, poor crowd control, and lack of official clearance turned the pilgrimage into chaos. ""Nobody is responsible - it was an act of god,"" Panda said.District police chief KV Maheswara Reddy said the main sanctum sits on the first floor with about 20 steps leading to it.""A railing along the staircase, believed to be poorly constructed, collapsed and caused a person to fall, triggering panic as the packed crowd surged forward,"" he said.Calling the deaths ""extremely heart-breaking"", CM N Chandrababu Naidu said: ""Had police been informed in advance, they could have implemented a crowd management plan.Those responsible will face action.""Srikakulam: The Venkateswara Swamy temple at Kasibugga, visited by around 3,000 devotees on Saturdays, saw a crowd nearly seven times that number on the day of the stampede as it was the first Karthika Ekadashi since the temple's inauguration. With no prior approval for the gathering or adequate security, the few guards were overwhelmed.District police chief KV Maheswara Reddy said temple authorities failed to alert police or the district administration about the festival and the likely crowd. Police have registered a case under section 100 (culpable homicide) of BNS and detained four temple staff for questioning. The shrine is not registered with Andhra endowments department, which oversees thousands of temples statewide.""Everything looked fine around 9am, but suddenly the number of devotees surged. The narrow stairway was choked. I was nearby when the railing broke and people started falling over each other,"" said R Ramanamma, a devotee.The deceasad were E Chinnammi (46), R Vijaya (48) from Tekkali; M Neelamma (60) from Vajrapukotturu; D Rajeswari (60), G Rupa (50), B Brunda from Mandasa; Ch Yasodamma (56) from Nandigam; D Ammulamma from Kasibugga; and L Nikhil (13) from Sompeta. Two women - B Kalavathi and R Kumari - remain critical. ""I have instructed officials to ensure treatment for the injured,"" CM Naidu said. PM Modi said he was ""pained"" by the tragedy. ""I pray that the injured recover soon,"" he said, announcing Rs 2 lakh ex gratia to each victim's family and Rs 50,000 to the injured. Saturday's crush was the third major temple tragedy in Andhra this year.Faith met fury of fate Saturday morning at Kasibugga in Srikakulam when a temple born of one man’s devotion turned into a site of death. Nine devotees were crushed to death at Lord Venkateswara Swamy temple, built by 94-year-old Hari Mukund Panda, reports Umamaheswara Rao.Panda, originally from Odisha, had dreamed of building the shrine after an “unsatisfactory” darshan at Tirupati a decade ago. His mother Hari Vishnupriya had urged him to build a temple of their own. That suggestion became a mission. On 12 acres of family land, Panda created a near-replica of Tirumala — complete with rituals, architecture, and traditions — to bring Lord Venkateswara closer to devotees of north coastal Andhra and southern Odisha.The temple, locally known as ‘chinna-Tirupati’ (mini-Tirupati), opened four months ago. It was built entirely with Panda’s own funds — no donations, no trustees. The 9ft single-stone idol of Lord Venkateswara was carved in Tirupati and dominates the sanctum. Hundreds of other divine idols dot the complex, blending Odisha’s sculptural style with south Indian temple design.But on the temple’s first major festival — Karthika Ekadasi — devotion overwhelmed design. The Ekadasi tithi began at 9.10am, and within minutes, volunteers were overrun.Beyond the temple, Panda is known for quiet philanthropy — feeding hundreds of poor and differently abled people weekly, funding pensions and arranging transport from Palasa railway station to his orchard for Monday meals. Panda said, “I built this temple to offer devotees peaceful and free darshan of Lord Venkateswara, not to witness such deaths.”","A railing collapse on a narrow staircase caused panic in a crowd of over 20,000 gathered for karthika ekadashi.

Andhra Tragedy Sixth Incident This Year

NEW DELHI: Stampedes, categorised as avoidable accidents, have claimed at least 114 lives so far this year, marking the second-highest toll in recent years. In 2024, at least 123 people lost their lives in such incidents, with the crowd crush in Hathras, UP, alone accounting for 116 deaths at the end of a satsang conducted by self-styled godman Narayan Sakar Hari.The stampede at the Venkateswara Swamy Temple in Srikakulam district, Andhra Pradesh, was the sixth such incident this year. Experts have often pointed out that the absence of proper crowd control mechanisms, poor communication, and inadequate emergency response systems aggravate such situations. Authorities frequently underestimate the expected number of attendees, leading to overcrowding and chaos.There have been five major stampedes that occurred earlier this year. On January 29, during the Mahakumbh, 30 people lost their lives. On February 15, at the New Delhi Railway Station, 18 people died in a stampede. In North Goa's Shirgao village, seven devotees were killed when lakhs had gathered to participate in the annual Lairai Jatra at the Shree Lairai Devi Temple. On June 4, 11 fans died and several others were injured in a stampede near Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru, during celebrations of RCB's maiden IPL win.The most recent tragedy occurred in Karur, Tamil Nadu, where at least 39 people died during a rally organised by Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) president and popular actor Vijay.","The stampede at the venkateswara swamy temple in srikakulam district, andhra pradesh, was the sixth such incident this year.

NEW DELHI: At least nine devotees, including eight women and a 13-year-old boy, died and several others were injured after a stampede broke out at the Sri Venkateswara Swamy Temple—popularly known as Chinna Tirupati—in Kasibugga town of Srikakulam district on Saturday morning.According to official reports, the incident occurred around 11:45 am when an estimated 15,000 devotees gathered for Ekadashi darshan at the newly constructed temple, which was inaugurated just four months ago.The temple, privately managed and not registered under the Endowments Department, reportedly had the same route for entry and exit.As per news agency PTI, police said the stampede occurred after an iron railing near the temple steps collapsed due to crowd pressure, triggering panic among devotees.Srikakulam SP KV Maheswara Reddy stated, “It is purely an accident and due to the owner’s mistake.

"Kerala free of extreme poverty, declares CM Pinarayi Vijayan; opposition calls it ‘hoax’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kerala-free-of-extreme-poverty-declares-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-opposition-calls-it-hoax/articleshow/125023910.cms,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday declared Kerala free of extreme poverty, saying it was the first state to achieve the feat. He made the announcement during a special assembly session convened to mark the state’s 69th formation day.Congress-led opposition, however, walked out of the House, terming the declaration a politically motivated “hoax”, made without any scientific basis.The CM said the Left govt had through a meticulous process identified 64,006 extremely poor families and lifted them out of abject poverty through micro plans. He added that successive govts had contributed to this achievement over time.Vijayan said the accomplishment marked a major milestone in the march towards creating a new Kerala. “Every Kerala Piravi Day (state foundation day) is celebrated with joy. However, this year’s Kerala Piravi Day marks a new dawn. Today, Kerala makes history by becoming the first Indian state without extreme poverty. The eradication of extreme poverty was a major decision taken at the first cabinet meeting after the new (Left) ministry was sworn in in 2021,” the CM said.The project began with the identification of beneficiary families “through a comprehensive participatory process”.“This list was presented in Gram Sabhas, from which 1,03,099 individuals from 64,006 families across 1,032 local bodies were identified as extremely poor, “ the CM explained.“Food, health, housing, and income were considered as the distress factors for identifying the extremely poor. Subsequently, micro plans were prepared for each family,” he added.For the financial years 2023–24 and 2024–25, Rs 50 crore each was allocated for the project and Rs 60 crore for 2025–26. “These funds were utilised for healthcare, housing and livelihood support...,” Vijayan said.Among the 64,006 families, 4,677 families required homes, which were built under the LIFE Mission, the CM said. Similarly, 2,713 families were first provided land and then assistance for house construction.","Chief minister pinarayi vijayan declared kerala free of extreme poverty.

"Opened after 54 years, Banke Bihari treasury reveals dust, raises doubts; SC-appointed panel is now auditing assets of temple",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opened-after-54-years-banke-bihari-treasury-reveals-dust-raises-doubts-sc-appointed-panel-is-now-auditing-assets-of-temple/articleshow/125027537.cms,"SC-Appointed Panel Is Now Auditing Assets Of Temple

MATHURA: The long-sealed treasury - toshakhana - of Vrindavan's Banke Bihari temple, believed to hold royal gifts, ornaments and centuries-old offerings, was opened last month after 54 years on the orders of an SC-appointed panel tasked with overseeing the temple's financial, structural and administrative functioning. But what emerged from the vault shocked many: one gold and three silver bars and utensils. With no inventory or donor records, the panel has launched the temple's first full asset audit, covering bank deposits worth up to Rs 400 crore, sealed lockers, land holdings and donation records - as questions mount over where the ""missing treasure"" is.Like on every Dhanteras, on Oct 18, the priest lit a small earthen lamp and placed it at the foot of the door of the treasury. The wood had darkened, carvings dulled, a panel eaten halfway by termites. No key had survived and a metal cutter was brought in. Snake catchers moved in first as forest officials stood by with oxygen cylinders. Behind the panels - sealed for more than five decades - lay the toshakhana.When it opened, there was no gold crown as expected. Or a gemstone necklace. Just a long wooden box containing a single gold bar and three silver bars streaked faintly with vermilion.Around them, there were brass utensils, wooden trays, and layers of dust so thick that one official described it as ""undisturbed for generations"". The chamber yielded no spectacle. But what it did offer was unsettling - the near-total absence of any official record of what had once been kept there: no donor register, no inventory, no valuation documents, and no reconciliation with decades of temple offerings.The toshakhana, last opened in 1971, had been spoken of for years in reverent tones - a place where ornaments, royal gifts from Bharatpur, Karauli and Gwalior, land deeds and handwritten letters were believed to lie, donated by kings and commoners to ""Thakurji"". Instead, the inventory was strikingly thin and sparked disbelief among devotees, demands for a CBI probe from locals, and a quiet but unmistakable scrutiny of the shrine's financial history.As of now, the items found in the toshakhana have not been formally valued, though they have been sealed. No FIR has been filed, and no report has been made public. ""The audit is on. This is the first official attempt to document the temple's assets,"" said a senior official associated with the panel. ""We don't have the full inventory yet. Even the panel is trying to find out. A CA firm has been appointed.""Banke Bihari temple, founded in 1864 by followers of saint and musician Swami Haridas, receives some 50,000 visitors a day - a number that rises to several lakhs on festivals and auspicious days. Yet unlike temples in the south, whose wealth was historically documented and regulated under systems of royal patronage and formal audits, Banke Bihari has evolved with a structure rooted in tradition rather than regulation. Offerings - jewellery, land, cash - have come in over generations, but few comprehensive records exist to track them.Among devotees, reactions have been mixed. ""My devotion is to the deity, not to any treasure,"" said Ramesh Patel, a Surat-based cloth trader who visits Vrindavan two or three times a year. ""Yes, I too was expecting something spectacular. But I am not disappointed. We hope all the assets will eventually be documented."" Others, however, have gone further. Dinesh Falhari, a local, has written to PM Narendra Modi seeking a CBI probe. Several residents in the vicinity have echoed the concern.The committee, chaired by retired HC judge Ashok Kumar, was formed after a series of PILs raised concerns over crowd management and administrative lapses. The recent vault opening has prompted the panel to expand its scope and begin a full structural and financial audit - the temple's first.As per official estimates, the temple holds between Rs 350 to 400 crore across over 10 bank accounts in Mathura and Vrindavan, most currently in Multi-Option Deposit form - a product that offers lower interest rates than fixed deposits. The panel has directed that these accounts be converted into FDs for better returns and asked bank officials to submit details of the temple's funds and their status.The audit has also raised questions about assets held outside the temple premises. While members of the Goswami community - hereditary sevayats who manage rituals and daily operations - acknowledge that jewellery had once been deposited in SBI's Mathura branch, there is no documentation on when this was done or what was deposited. ""Still not with us,"" said the official. ""The Goswamis say the jewellery is there. But no order to open the lockers has been given yet. We don't have a list of items, and there is no record of valuation.""There is no exhaustive list of temple-owned land, income from leases, or encroachment details. Officials have said that the local tehsildar and SDM have been asked to retrieve land records from around the temple. The temple manager has also been asked to prepare a consolidated report of all bank accounts, financial assets and donation receipts before the panel's next meeting on Nov 19.Within the sevayat community, there is growing discomfort over public speculation around the temple's finances. ""People are comparing Banke Bihari with temples in the south,"" said Shailendra Goswami, a member of the committee and part of the lineage of Swami Haridas. ""But those temples were built by kings. Our's was built in stages, in 1864, with around Rs 70,000 collected from devotees. Even the large Hindola (rocking cradle) was made from offerings. Some of Bihariji's jewellery is in the SBI branch - this has been shared with the committee. No one can make a single accusation against the priests.""Three of the four Goswami members who are part of the high-powered committee confirmed that their concerns had been placed on record at the committee's Oct 29 meeting. Among the issues discussed was the crowd situation and the perception being created around the vault opening. ""This is Bihariji's temple,"" one of them said. ""The service is done by love. Let them do their audit. We have nothing to hide.""","Sc-appointed panel is now auditing assets of vrindavan's banke bihari temple. With no inventory or donor records, the panel has launched the temple's first full asset audit. It covers bank deposits worth up to rs 400 crore, sealed lockers, land holdings and donation records.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125027574,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1634329,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
