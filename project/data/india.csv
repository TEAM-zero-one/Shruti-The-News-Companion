Violation of norms in vaccination of stray dogs and non-implementation of ABC progs flagged by the Centre multiple times,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/violation-of-norms-in-vaccination-of-stray-dogs-and-non-implementation-of-abc-progs-flagged-by-the-centre-multiple-times/articleshow/123514945.cms,"NEW DELHI: Much before the Supreme Court’s order that led to renewed attention towards tackling the menace of stray dogs, the Centre had sent multiple letters/advisories to states and UTs with the latest one on July 16 asking local civic bodies to undertake large-scale sterilisation programmes, covering 70% of stray dogs. These letters had constantly been flagging inaction on the ground — the point which the apex court too had underlined in its orders this month.One of the letters, sent by the ministry of animal husbandry and dairying in Nov last year, clearly pointed out the failure of states in implementing the animal birth control (ABC) programme and the anti-rabies vaccination programme.“The central government has framed the Animal Birth Control Rules, 2023. However, there has been violation of the Rules by state local bodies,” said the ministry in its letter to the chief secretaries of states/UTs on November 11, 2024.It said, “Municipal bodies should ensure that dogs within their jurisdiction, especially in areas such as anganwadis, schools and hospitals are mandatorily sterilised.”Since the incidents of dog bites continued unabated, secretaries of three ministries — animal husbandry, housing and urban affairs, and panchayati raj — jointly issued an advisory on July 16, reiterating that “sterilisation of stray dogs is central to dog population management”.Pointing out that the current infrastructure in many urban areas remains inadequate, they requested all urban local bodies to establish ABC units and roll-out large-scale sterilisation programmes, targeting at least 70% of the stray dog population to achieve measurable outcomes.The day Supreme Court had come out with its order on Aug 11, directing local civic bodies in Delhi-NCR to round up stray dogs and confine them in shelters, the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) asked the states/UTs to adopt the revised ABC module/scheme — published on February 27 — to implement sterilisation and vaccination programmes.Under the revised scheme, financial assistance of up to Rs 800 per dog is given for local bodies to conduct ABC programmes. Besides a one-time grant of Rs 2 crore is provisioned for state-run veterinary hospitals. In addition, the AWBI provides assistance up to Rs 15 lakh for establishment of small animal shelter to Urban Local Bodies, Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animal and recognised animal welfare organisations.In response to a parliament question during the monsoon session on August 19, the minister of state for fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying S P Singh Baghel in his written response said that the issue of stray dogs falls under the purview of state governments, with local bodies mandated to manage related matters.“To ensure humane and effective dog population management, the central government has framed the Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules, 2023, under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. These Rules align with the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) standards for the Capture–Neuter–Vaccinate–Release (CNVR) approach. Under the Rules, local bodies are responsible for implementing sterilisation and vaccination programmes in collaboration with animal welfare organisations,” Singh informed the Lok Sabha.",The centre had sent multiple letters/advisories to states and uts with the latest one on july 16 asking local civic bodies to undertake large-scale sterilisation programmes.

SSC Recruitment Scam: Massive Protest In Kolkata, Police Detains Protesting Teachers Amid Scuffles

NEW DELHI: Amid protests over glitches and irregularities in the conduct of computer-based govt recruitment examinations by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), SSC chairman S Gopalakrishnan on Monday assured that the “technical and operational matters” faced by a few candidates in the first selection post examination on July 24, have been “stabilised” and no major disruptions anticipated in the upcoming exams.Gopalakrishnan said around 5.5 lakh candidates had appeared in the first exam, the first to be held after M/s Eduquity replaced M/s TCS as the exam conducting agency (ECA) in July 2025, with questions being set by other content agencies and delivered digitally from a vault. Some candidates at two of the total 194 centres faced issues due to bugs, like duplication of questions, repeat of same options, etc.“A detailed analysis by CDAC identified about 59,000 candidates affected by system disruptions. They will now retake the exam in three shifts on August 29, 2025,” he said adding that the stenographer exams conducted from Aug 6-8 had witnessed no disruptions. SSC has also rescheduled the Combined Graduate Level (CGL) Exam from August 13 to mid-September.On Congress alleging “rigging” of government recruitment exams under the Modi government and slamming the “brutal lathicharge” on those protesting against it, SSC alleged that the protests, led by coaching institutes, were aimed at protecting business models rather than the genuine interests of candidates.Elaborating on the recent SSC examination reforms, Gopalakrishnan said aadhaar-based authentication at the application level and exam venue has helped prevent impersonation and repeated attempts by candidates to appear in multiple sessions or to take the role of scribes and exam functionaries. Also, deviation from old question patterns had denied the coaching institutes undue advantage. Rather than a single agency like TCS performing all tasks, SSC, has, from July onwards, entrusted different aspects of the examinations to four agencies.Eduquity is now the ECA, even as content agencies set the questions, CDAC handles IT security and detects hacking/malpractices and an independent agency monitors the exams. The idea is that no single agency can hijack or compromise the exams, and to maintain transparency and fairness, according to Gopalakrishnan.He further noted that the content providers, ECA and monitoring agencies are subject to deterrent penalties for any shortcomings in performance.The multiple agency system, it was highlighted, has resulted in certain entities (led by some online tutors or coaching institutes) attributing the initial system hiccups to ECA and demanding that TCS be brought back. Gopalakrishnan however explained that Eduquity was selected through a tender, with TCS listed only at third position in the bid.","Ssc chairman s gopalakrishnan assured that the “technical and operational matters” faced by a few candidates in the first selection post examination on july 24, have been ‘stabilised’ he said no major disruptions are anticipated in the upcoming exams.

'Couple had a heated row just before incident'

Noida: The investigation into the death of 26-year-old Nikki Bhati, in which her husband Vipin is the prime accused and has been charged with murder, has taken a turn. CCTV footage that emerged on Monday purportedly shows Vipin standing at a grocery shop outside their Greater Noida house at the time when Nikki was allegedly attacked on Aug 21 evening.The footage, from a shop diagonally opposite from the Bhati house in Sirsa village, has prompted police to revisit the timeline and scrutinise videos of the alleged assault shared by Nikki's family. These videos, including one in which Nikki is seen purportedly staggering down the stairs with her torso on fire, were taken by her sister Kanchan, who lives in the same house and is married to Vipin's younger brother Rohit.On Monday, police made two more arrests, taking into custody Vipin's father Satveer and Rohit, both of whom had been absconding since the alleged murder.Vipin and his mother Daya were arrested on Sunday. Vipin, who allegedly tried to flee cops while he was being taken to the crime scene, was shot in the leg in an encounter.The time stamp on the footage from the camera that purportedly shows Vipin and his six-year-old son standing on the road puts him at the grocery store at the time of the alleged assault, which - according to the complaint from Nikki's family and the time recorded on the video shared by Kanchan of Nikki engulfed in flames - is 5.45pm, police sources said.In the CCTV clip, the man, believed to be Vipin wearing a check shirt and blue trousers, is seen standing near a white car parked on the main road outside the house at 5.42pm. A boy joins him, apparently holding a rope that he tugs several times. The man lingers, glancing down the road and chatting with two or three boys. Suddenly, at 5.47pm, a commotion appears to erupt. The man in the check shirt sprints towards the house, followed closely by an older man who also rushes inside. Moments later, the younger man emerges again, gesturing to bystanders who gather. He is seen talking to a man in shorts as the crowd swells. At 5.48pm, the man gets into the white car, briefly steps out, and then reverses the vehicle into the lane as more people gather.Devendra, Vipin's cousin, claimed that Nikki suffered burns from a cylinder blast in the kitchen. ""The shop where Vipin is standing is opposite their house. I heard Vipin shouting about rushing Nikki to hospital. Everyone was shouting about Nikki being injured in a fire. If you see the footage, you'll see me walking out of my shop in shorts after Vipin. I downed the shutters and drove the car. Along with uncle and aunty (Daya and Satveer), I took Nikki to hospital. She told us there was a cylinder blast inside the house and kept asking for water all the way to the hospital as she couldn't breathe. We took her to Fortis Hospital, where she also told the doctor about a cylinder blast,"" he said.A senior officer said the timing of the footage and that of videos shared by Nikki's family need to be matched. ""We will cross-check a few things, especially the time span. We are anyway verifying the contents of the footage and the video handed over to us by Kanchan as the main evidence. Footage from the hospital where Nikki was taken to initially needs to be examined too,"" he told TOI.Devendra's version conflicts with that of Kanchan, who alleged her sister was set on fire. In one of the videos posted by Kanchan on her YouTube channel, Vipin is seen dragging Nikki by the hair and taunting her to ""make a video"". Another brief video shows Nikki engulfed in flames. According to Vipin's relatives, the clips are from last winter, not Aug 21.Police said they would probe all possibilities, including dowry harassment, domestic violence and suicide. ""The accused, the husband, father-in-law, mother-in-law and brother-in-law, have all been arrested,"" said Sudhir Kumar, additional DCP, Greater Noida.Investigators have learned that tension started after Nikki and Kanchan opened a beauty parlour at home. The family allegedly opposed the venture, but Nikki persisted. Relations deteriorated further in 2024 after Nikki discovered Vipin's affair with a woman from Jarcha, who later filed a police case against him for physical abuse. In the days leading up to Nikki's death, the couple was not on talking terms, living in separate rooms, sources said. ""The couple had a heated argument minutes before the incident, during which Vipin allegedly slapped Nikki several times,"" a police source said.","Nikki bhati, 26, was found dead on august 21 in greater noida. Her husband vipin is the prime accused and has been charged with murder. Cctv footage that emerged on monday purportedly shows him at a grocery shop at the time when nikki was allegedly attacked. The footage has prompted police to revisit the timeline and scrutinise videos of the alleged assault.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123512681,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-87340,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Framing norms shouldn’t be knee-jerk reaction: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday said online shows by influencers and YouTubers do not enjoy the protection that free speech does. Saying so, it asked five popular content creators to tender public apologies on their channels - they have already apologised to the court - for ridiculing people with disability in their shows.""Influencers commercialise speech. When a speech falls in the ambit of commercial or prohibitive categories, the immunity under right to free speech is not available,"" a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi ruled.The case that started with Ranveer Allahbadia's vulgar comments was expanded to cover these five: Samay Raina, Vipul Goyal, Balraj Paramjeet Singh Ghai, Sonali Thakur and Nishant Jagdish Tanwar.AG R Venkataramani said he has held consultations with stakeholders, including I&B ministry, for framing guidelines for speeches on the web world, but added the issue required sensitive handling since it concerns free speech.SC said framing of guidelines should not be a knee-jerk reaction to infractions by a few influencers but must be broad-based, considering the advances in communication technology and the challenges that might arise in future and would need to be tackled to ensure an inclusive society.“Unless effective guidelines are in place, the young generation’s fertile mind would enable them to step around it. Consequences for breaching the line should be proportional to the harm/damage caused. Otherwise, they would think that they would be off the hook by tendering an apology,"" SC said.The influencers faced SC’s heat after SMA Foundation accused them of ridiculing the exorbitant cost of treatment for spinal muscular atrophy, a rare disease and disability. Senior advocate Aparajita Singh said influencers must be responsible in their speeches as what they say matters a lot to the younger generation.Singh suggested that apart from tendering apologies, they must carry out activities towards creating an inclusive society.Kant and Bagchi said the influencers present in the courtroom must tender public apologies on their channels and file affidavits detailing the activities they have undertaken towards mainstreaming people with disability. “Degree of repentance should be proportionate to the degree of violation,” the bench said. It said the question of appropriate penalty/cost that may be imposed on them would be considered later.",Supreme court says online shows by influencers and youtubers do not enjoy the protection that free speech does.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday revealed why he left Gujarat for two years while the probe into the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case was under way.Shah said it was he who submitted in the court to leave the state, as Justice Aftab Alam, who was hearing the case, feared the BJP leader could tamper with the evidence, given his past influential position.Amit Shah was the home minister of the BJP-ruled Gujarat under then-chief minister Narendra Modi.Responding to ANI’s question on whether Justice Aftab Alam had visited his house to take his signature mandating his exile, Amit Shah said: ""This never happened. Aftab Alam never came to my house, nor did such a need ever arise. On Sunday, he convened a special court to hear my bail application and observed that Amit Shah, who had served as home minister, could tamper with the evidence.""The Union home minister futher said: ""Therefore, responding to that observation, my lawyer submitted that unless the bail application was decided, my client would stay outside Gujarat. That was my statement (about leaving Gujarat).""Pointing out the delay in the hearing of his bail application, Shah said: ""I stayed outside Gujarat for two years because, in India’s history, no bail application was ever dragged for that long (2 years).The maximum a bail application had taken to be heard was 11 days.""Shah defended the government's 130th Constitutional (Amendment) Bill by giving his example when he stepped down as the minister merely on the CBI 's summons.He added that he did not hold any constitutional post until the case was fully quashed.""As I received the summons from CBI, I resigned the very next day. I was arrested later. The case went on, and the judgment also came that this was a case of political vendetta, and I am completely innocent. That judgment came later, I was granted bail earlier...

Thakur hails India’s space strides



NEW DELHI: BJP MP Anurag Thakur, during an interaction with school children on National Space Day, asked “who was the first person to travel to space.” When the students answered “Neil Armstrong,” Thakur responded, “I think Hanuman ji was the first person to travel to space. ” The exchange has drawn sharp criticism from the opposition, with the DMK accusing him of “confusing fact with fable.”While interacting with students at Shri Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Una, Himachal Pradesh, on National Space Day, Thakur argued that knowledge traditions should extend beyond what he described as “textbooks given to us by the British.” He urged teachers to look towards “our veds, our textbooks and our knowledge,” saying this would allow students to see “a lot more.”The remark triggered an immediate backlash from the DMK. Party MP Kanimozhi, in a post on X, said: “A member of parliament and former union minister asking school children who first set foot on the moon, and insisting that it was not Neil Armstrong but Hanuman, is deeply troubling. Science is not mythology. To mislead young minds in classrooms is an insult to knowledge, reason, and the spirit of scientific temper enshrined in our Constitution.India’s future lies in nurturing curiosity, not confusing fact with fable.”At the same event, Thakur highlighted India’s recent achievements in the space sector, noting the Chandrayaan-3 success in 2023 and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s role in supporting scientists. He said India is aiming to set up its own space station by 2035 and achieve a crewed lunar landing by 2040.He also pointed to India’s growing space economy, the development of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, and milestones such as launching 104 satellites in one flight and the successful testing of the reusable launch vehicle. “Earlier we had to seek help from foreign countries to launch our satellites, but now foreign nations seek help from us,” Thakur told students.The occasion marked the second National Space Day, commemorating India’s Chandrayaan-3 mission.

NEW DELHI: Villagers from Sukma and Bastar in Chhattisgarh, who had been victims of Left-Wing extremism and Naxal violence, have written an open letter to Members of Parliament, urging them not to vote for Opposition bloc’s vice-presidential candidate B Sudershan Reddy.The letter points to Justice Reddy's order against the Salwa Judum movement - a state-backed campaign launched to drive out Naxals from Bastar.The villagers claim his judgment weakened efforts against insurgency. ""The entire Bastar region would have been peaceful, but after the 2011 Supreme Court verdict, Bastar has been trembling with fear,"" the letter reads.Raising sharp questions, the villagers ask: ""Should such a supporter of Naxals be seated on this post in the country?"" and ""Think again — what do Congress and its senior leaders want to establish by making such a person their candidate?""They further add, ""Is Congress against peace in Bastar?""The protest comes after the BJP named CP Radhakrishnan as its nominee for Vice-President, following which the Congress-led INDIA bloc declared Justice B Sudershan Reddy as its challenger.Villagers in Bastar and Sukma have now voiced concern over his candidacy, citing his past stance on Salwa Judum.Senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad also hit out at retired SC judge Reddy, alleging that his 2011 verdict on Salwa Judum reflected an “inclination towards Maoism.”“In India, the office of the Vice President holds the second-highest constitutional position. It is therefore crucial to understand the mindset and ideology of the person nominated for this post.

What happened during earlier hearings

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday directed five social media influencers, including India’s Got Latent host Samay Raina, to issue a public apology for mocking persons with disabilities. The apex court observed that freedom of speech and expression can't be applicable to commercial speech hurting sentiments of other community.The court asked the Centre to frame guidelines for social media to curb speeches offending or ridiculing disabled, women, children and senior citizens.The top court also said that it will impose penalties on the social media influencers, including Raina for targeting persons with disabilities.Guidelines for social media regulations shouldn't be knee jerk reaction but based on broad parameters having views of all stakeholders, the SC observed, as reported by PTI.Also read - Row over joke on disability: SC pulls up Samay Raina, 4 others; observes 'many free advisors in market' According to LiveLaw, counsel for the respondents undertook that each of them would display an apology on their YouTube channels and podcasts and also file affidavits confirming compliance. The court said their personal appearance was dispensed with for now, provided they adhered to this undertaking.Also read - Samay Raina, other influencers must appear personally in court: Supreme Court ""Humor is well taken and is a part of life. We laugh at ourselves. But when we start laughing at others and create a breach of sensibility...on a community plane, when humor is generated, it becomes problematic. And this is what so-called influencers of today should bear in mind. They are commercializing speech. The community at large should not be utilized to hurt the sentiments of certain sections. It's not only freedom of speech, it's commercial speech,"" the bench said, as quoted by LiveLaw.The bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi also said the question of penalty or costs would be decided later.During the hearing, Justice Kant remarked, “There should be a balance of rights and duties”.During the hearing on July 15, the court asked Attorney General R Venkataramani to draft social media guidelines balancing free speech and others' rights. Emphasising the difficulty of enforcing such guidelines, the bench remarked, “Article 19... can’t overpower Article 21,” adding, “Suppose a race takes place between Article 19 and 21, Article 21 has to trump Article 19.”Justice Kant had stressed the need to protect dignity: “What we are doing is for posterity. You have to ensure that not a single word is misused by anyone... A framework must be there that the dignity of anyone is not violated.”The petition was filed by NGO Cure SMA Foundation of India. The court previously warned that mocking the disabled cannot be allowed under the guise of free speech and termed the influencers’ actions “damaging” and “demoralising.”Raina, along with podcaster Ranveer Allahbadia, was booked by Maharashtra and Assam police.

The agency then sent the seized NRI certificates to Indian embassies and missions for verification. Most of them were found to be forged or fake. The probe further revealed these medical colleges were paying agents to have fake NRI documents prepared.The agents also prepared fake family trees of NRIs, wherein these unrelated NRIs were shown as relatives of students to help secure admissions under the NRI quota. In some cases, the agents and medical colleges used documents of one NRI for admissions of multiple candidates, who were unrelated to the NRI sponsor and to each other.The promoters of these medical colleges were found to be behind the illegal admission racket, with their agents spread across the country bringing ""clients"" and helping them generate huge ""proceeds of crime"".The Centre has since revised its NRI admission policy, with the DG of health services issuing fresh guidelines wherein each NRI certificate has to be authenticated by embassies and missions before admission is granted on its basis. This happened after coordinated action involving multiple Union ministries.The MEA too has issued fresh guidelines to its embassies and missions abroad, for strict due diligence in issuance of NRI certificates, outlining the eligibility criteria and clearly delineating 'first degree' and 'second degree' relatives in respect of whom NRIs can get certificates for admissions under the quota in India.The involvement of some NRIs has also come to light. They allowed their names to be used after receiving bribes from the agents of the medical colleges. ""The agents approached and obtained credentials of unrelated NRIs by paying money to them,"" the investigation found.The existing rules specify that the fees of the NRI student must be paid by the NRI sponsor. However, the investigation found that in a majority of the cases fees were paid by the family of the student and not the NRI sponsor, thereby defeating the very purpose of the policy, which is to earn foreign exchange, sources said.Probe revealed many NRI sponsors were not present in India on the dates affidavits were notarised and signed, a senior official said.","Private medical colleges were found offering admissions on about 18,000 reserved mbbs ug and pg seats under the quota by using forged documents of non-resident indians.

What is Mysuru Dasara



NEW DELHI: Senior BJP leaders have objected to the Karnataka government’s decision to invite Booker Prize-winning author and activist Banu Mushtaq to inaugurate this year’s Mysuru Dasara celebrations. Karnataka minister G Parameshwara, however, countered the criticism, saying, ""This is not a religious issue.""Former minister and BJP MLC CT Ravi argued that it was inappropriate for someone ""whose faith is uncertain"" to lead a religious ceremony.Former Mysuru MP Pratap Simha said while he respects Mushtaq’s achievements, she should preside over literary events, not Dasara. ""It is acceptable when she chairs the Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelana but not Dasara, a Hindu religious event which begins with pooja to Goddess Chamundeshwari. Does she have faith in Chamundeshwari Devi? Is she following our traditions?"" he asked.Expelled BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal echoed similar views on X. ""I personally hold respect for Banu Mushtaq madam as a writer and activist. However, her inaugurating Dasara by offering flowers and lighting the lamp to Goddess Chamundeshwari seems to be in conflict with her own religious beliefs,"" he said. Yatnal added that Mushtaq should clarify whether she continues to follow Islam or believes in a broader path that aligns with Hindu traditions, stressing that such clarity was necessary before she performed the inaugural rituals.""She may certainly inaugurate cultural or literary events within Dasara festivities, but the religious inauguration itself should be refrained from,"" Yatnal said, using the hashtag #KarnatakaDasara2025.In another post on X, written in Kannada, he said, ""It is not right for the Dasara inauguration to be done by those from other religions who do not believe in Hindu dharma and practices, and who consider flower worship and idol worship to be 'haram'.""However, BJP MP Tejasvi Surya struck a slightly different note, saying, ""I don’t have an objection to anybody. But Mysuru Dasara is an important religious festival of Karnataka, and we only expect that whoever inaugurates it and offers the first prayers should make their belief in Goddess Chamundeshwari public and clear.""Congress-ruled Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara hit back at BJP's objections to Banu Mushtaq inaugurating Mysuru Dasara, saying, ""It is not right to oppose this.
