On the growing trend of benches overturning orders of earlier ones within days or months of them being pronounced - such as on the menace of dog bites, retrospective environmental clearance, Bhushan Steel Ltd's insolvency and the ban on fire crackers - the apex court observed ""painfully"" that the practice would ""undermine this court's authority"".In another instance, though it was done through a curative petition filed against SC's 2021 verdict on the dispute between Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and Reliance Infrastructure's Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Ltd (DAMEPL), the court had overruled the judgment last year, quashing the Rs 7,687-crore award in favour of DAMEPL.A bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Augustine George Masih said that public confidence in the judiciary would be undermined if cases were reopened and special benches set up to re-hear them at the behest of parties aggrieved by the verdicts.Quoting Justice Robert Jackson, it said, ""We are not final because we are infallible, but we are infallible only because we are final.""""In the recent past, we have rather painfully observed a growing trend in this court (of which we too are an indispensable part) of verdicts pronounced by judges, whether still in office or not and irrespective of the time lapse since the pronouncement, being overturned by succeeding benches or specially constituted benches at the behest of some party aggrieved by the verdicts prior in point of time.To us, the object of Article 141 of the Constitution seems to be this: the pronouncement of a verdict by a bench on a particular issue of law (arising out of the facts involved) should settle the controversy, being final, and has to be followed by all courts as law declared by SC,"" the bench said.It said that if a verdict was allowed to be reopened, the very purpose of enacting Article 141 (law declared by SC is binding) would stand defeated. The court passed the order while hearing a plea seeking relaxation of bail conditions for an accused who was directed not to leave Kolkata during trial of a murder case. The court noted that he had filed an application after the retirement of the apex court judge who had imposed the condition, and dismissed his plea.The bench held that judicial discipline, propriety and comity demanded that a succeeding bench of different judges defers to the view expressed by the earlier bench, unless there was something so grossly erroneous on the face of the record or palpably wrong that it necessitated a relook in exercise of inherent jurisdiction either through a review or curative petition. ""...As judges of this court, we are alive to the position that overturning a prior verdict by a later verdict does not necessarily mean that justice is better served,"" the bench said.""However, with an over looming sense of dissatisfaction and remorse, we propose not to walk that path. While it is true that in a case of the present nature - where an issue of a citizen's right to move freely throughout the territory of India is involved - the principle of finality may not be applied strictly against the party whose right has been so restricted, but the antecedent facts in the light whereof the restriction is imposed assume significance and must, of necessity, bear serious thought.

Explained: How new labour laws could hit your take-home salary, increase your provident fund & gratuity contributions

New Labour Codes: Why will your take home pay go down?

Mandatory retirement contributions, including provident fund and gratuity payments, are set to rise following the implementation of the Code on Wages.

and payments, are set to rise following the implementation of the Code on Wages. The new regulation requires that an employee's basic salary must constitute at least 50% of their total CTC, or meet the government-specified percentage.

This adjustment will lead to higher contributions as both PF and gratuity calculations are based on an individual’s basic pay .

. Whilst this change ensures enhanced retirement benefits for workers, it also means reduced take-home pay, as the increased contributions will come from the existing CTC.

The regulation concerning basic salary aims to stop organisations from intentionally maintaining low basic salary whilst increasing allowances to reduce their obligations towards retirement benefits and gratuity.

Currently, PF contributions are set at 12% of the basic salary, whilst gratuity payments are determined by the final basic pay and tenure at an organisation.

New labour Codes: Impact on Take-Home Salary

.

New Labour Codes: Top points to know

.

New labour codes 2025: In a significant move, the government has notified the new labour laws that may require companies to ensure that the basic salary makes up at least 50% of the total cost-to-company (CTC). This could potentially prompt changes in how pay packages are structured. As a result, for many employees, take-home pay could come down over time as contributions to retirement savings are likely to rise.The government has unified 29 labour-related central laws into four extensive Labour Codes: the Code on Wages (2019), Industrial Relations Code (2020), Code on Social Security (2020), and Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSHWC) Code (2020). Starting November 21, 2025, these Codes seek to simplify regulatory compliance, enhance worker safeguards, and modernise India's workforce regulations in accordance with contemporary economic conditions.The Code on Wages became operational on Friday, with the government expected to announce detailed rules within the next 45 days. Companies will need to restructure their salary frameworks to comply with these new regulations.According to experts, employees might receive reduced take-home pay under the new rules, as both provident fund and gratuity contributions would increase within the existing CTC framework.""The new labour codes unify the definition of 'wages' under the Code on Wages and Social Security. This would mean better retirement security through higher gratuity and provident fund but a possible dip in take-home pay if employers restructure allowances downward to offset costs,"" Suchita Dutta, executive director of the Indian Staffing Federation was quoted as saying by ET.The standardisation of wage definitions across labour codes ensures uniformity in computing social security benefits.""Wages now include basic pay, dearness allowance and retaining allowance; 50% of the total remuneration (or such percentage as may be notified) shall be added back to compute wages, ensuring consistency in calculating gratuity, pension and social security benefits,"" explains Anjali Malhotra, partner at professional services firm Nangia Group.According to Puneet Gupta, partner, People Advisory Services at EY India, the implementation of labour codes could result in increased gratuity payments since calculations will be based on ""wages"", encompassing basic salary and all allowances, excluding HRA and conveyance allowance.The new labour codes introduce universal minimum wages for all employees across organised and unorganised sectors, replacing the earlier system that covered only about 30% of workers.A statutory floor wage will be set by the government based on minimum living standards, and no state can fix wages below this benchmark.A uniform definition of wages now applies, where basic pay, dearness allowance, and retaining allowance together must account for at least 50% of total remuneration.The codes mandate gender equality, prohibiting discrimination in hiring, wages, or employment terms for similar work, along with universal wage payment coverage that ensures timely payments and prevents unauthorised deductions for employees earning up to ₹24,000 per month. Overtime compensation must be paid at twice the normal rate.Several compliance and enforcement reforms are included as well. Decriminalisation of offences replaces imprisonment with monetary penalties for first-time violations, and compounding of offences allows certain fines to be settled without prosecution.The threshold for government approval of lay-offs, retrenchment, or closure has increased from 100 to 300 workers, with states allowed to raise it further.Work-from-home is formally recognised in services sectors based on mutual agreement, while dispute resolution will be handled by two-member tribunals for faster outcomes.A mandatory 14-day strike notice aims to prevent sudden disruptions and includes mass casual leave within the definition of a strike.The codes extend social protections to new categories, requiring aggregators to contribute 1–2% of annual turnover towards gig and platform workers’ social security (capped at 5% of their payments).Fixed-term employees become eligible for gratuity after just one year of continuous service instead of five.The inspector-cum-facilitator system introduces randomised, technology-driven inspections to reduce harassment and improve transparency. Compliance is simplified through digitisation of records, as well as a streamlined one license, one registration, one return system.Employers must issue formal appointment letters detailing job roles, wages, and social security.The codes also expand labour flexibility and reduce burdens on small units.Night shifts for women are permitted in all establishments with their consent and safety measures. Contract labour rules include an all-India licence valid for five years.Factory thresholds have been raised to 20 workers for units using power and 40 for those without, reducing compliance requirements for smaller factories.Finally, working hours remain capped at 8 hours per day and 48 hours per week, with flexible weekly structures allowed through mutual consent.","Mandatory retirement contributions, including provident fund and gratuity payments, are set to rise following the implementation of the code on wages. The new regulation requires that an employee's basic salary must constitute at least 50% of the total cost-to-company (ctc) this adjustment will lead to higher contributions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125516988,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-41896,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Amid reports of leadership reshuffle, Karnataka minister Satish Jarkiholi on Wednesday said chief minister Siddaramaiah has asked the Congress high command to take an early call on the question of leadership change in the state.Jarkiholi, who handles the public works portfolio, told reporters that he plans to seek an appointment with Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge to discuss the matter. He said the issue of succession must be settled by the party’s national leadership and revealed that Siddaramaiah too prefers a swift decision.According to Jarkiholi, deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar has openly expressed his desire to take over as chief minister since the beginning of the government’s term, though the party chose Siddaramaiah for the top job. He said the final call rests with the high command but added that the chief minister’s remarks make the situation more urgent.""When CM says it, then seniors in the party should take note of it,"" he stated. However, he maintained that no internal discussions have taken place among MLAs on a possible leadership shift. ""There is no discussion about leadership change in the party. Once it comes up then we will discuss but there is no discussion about it in the party right now,"" Jarkiholi said.He also confirmed that he plans to meet Kharge soon to share his views. On speculation around Shivakumar’s active outreach, he remarked that the deputy chief minister has met several people both formally and informally, and added that he too had met him.Responding to home minister G Parameshwara’s claim that he should also be considered for chief ministership, Jarkiholi said Parameshwara had served as Pradesh Congress Committee chief for five years. ""I had said in Belagavi that there is nothing wrong in making such claims. So he too is senior but who will decide finally? It happens in Delhi. All that we can do is just make a claim"".Jarkiholi also indicated that Siddaramaiah’s role would remain important even after any future transition. ""We (Congress) will require CM Siddaramaiah’s leadership, his service and guidance even after his retirement from the active politics"".The leadership tussle between Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar has intensified in recent months, with party sources claiming Shivakumar has been pushing to be named the next chief minister.

NEW DELHI: Stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra has once again landed in controversy -- this time over a photo he shared online wearing a T-shirt that appeared to mock the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The post quickly triggered outrage within the BJP , with the saffron party warning of police action.The row erupted after Kamra posted on his social media accounts a photo of himself in the respective T-shirt. He captioned the photo 'not clicked at a comedy show', hinting at the previous controversy that angered Shiv Sena , resulting in the destruction of the venue of his comedy show.Maharashtra minister and senior BJP leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule said the government would not ignore such posts. “The police would take action against anyone who puts out such objectionable posts,” he warned, responding to Kamra’s picture that showed a dog image alongside a reference to the RSS, the ideological parent of the BJP.Shiv Sena cabinet minister Sanjay Shirsat -- whose party is a BJP ally -- said the saffron party must respond strongly this time, recalling Kamra’s past potshots at both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde . “Earlier, he targeted Prime Minister Modi and Eknath Shinde, and now he has dared to directly attack the RSS. The BJP needs to respond to this,” Shirsat said.“We (Shiv Sena) responded to it (to Kamra's critical comments on Shinde earlier this year).Now, he has mustered the courage to make an objectionable post against the RSS,” he added.This is not Kamra’s first clash with political leaders. In March, he sparked a storm after mocking Shinde during a show by tweaking the lyrics of a popular Hindi film song. Angered by his remarks, Shiv Sena workers later vandalised the Habitat Comedy Club in Mumbai’s Khar -- the venue where Kamra had performed -- as well as the hotel building it is housed in.","Stand-up comedian kunal kamra has once again landed in controversy.

Delhi Student Suicide Case: Massive Protest Outside School After Note Alleges Harassment By Teachers

Defining the boundary between scolding and humiliation

The shifting emotional world of students

Pressure, competition and the punishment loop

A fragile safety system

So what's the way forward



The words come from Suman Prakash, a teacher and a career counsellor with over twenty years of experience, but they echo through classrooms across the country.His warning lands heavily in a year where student suicides have reached their highest levels ever recorded in India. Government data shows that student suicides rose from just over eight thousand a decade ago to nearly fourteen thousand in 2023, an increase far steeper than population growth.Behind the numbers are classrooms shaped by competition, families weighed down by expectations and schools where discipline often blurs into public shame.The death of a Class 10 student in Delhi, who allegedly named teachers in a suicide note and had complained of humiliation, has now placed renewed scrutiny on whether certain disciplinary practices have become psychologically unsafe. Protests outside his school, questioning by police and testimonies from classmates have built a portrait of a child who struggled not with failure, but with fear.At the heart of the debate is a simple question:When does teaching a lesson stop being discipline and start becoming emotional injury?Teachers, psychologists and counsellors consistently draw a distinction between corrective reprimand and humiliation, although that distinction often collapses inside real classrooms.Scolding, in its intended form, is private and behaviour specific. It pinpoints an action, suggests correction and remains controlled in tone.Humiliation, on the other hand, is public, identity directed and often delivered with mockery, comparison or threat. It takes the shape of comments about character rather than conduct, such as “you will never succeed”, “look at others, learn from them” or “you are always the problem”.Humiliation traps a child in a social spotlight they cannot escape, and psychologists note that it activates the same pain pathways as physical harm. The difference between the two is not mere semantics, because children interpret them very differently. A behaviour based correction can motivate, but identity based shaming can rupture trust and trigger panic, especially when the student is already anxious about parental expectations or peer comparison.This is the environment in which punishment culture thrives. In schools where academic output determines reputation, in coaching centres where competitive ranks shape futures, and in homes where opportunity is tied to marks, punishment often becomes a normalised tool, even when its emotional cost is profound.Teachers with long experience describe students today as more vulnerable to harsh reprimand than those of two decades ago. Science teacher Biva Jha, who has taught for more than twenty five years, attributes this sensitivity to changes in childhood routines and family structures.She points to declining physical activity, heavy reliance on mobile phones and the increasing number of single child households. “Children today are physically and emotionally more sensitive. With less outdoor play and more exposure to social media, they become easily overwhelmed,” she explains. Many are unaccustomed to hearing the word no at home, which reduces their resilience when faced with criticism outside.Her view is echoed, though differently framed, by younger teachers entering the profession. Rashi Mungia, who has been teaching for a year, says even primary school children now “understand mental health, emotions and what feels right or wrong.” This awareness demands that teachers monitor not only what they say, but how they say it. “One negative remark can affect a child for years,” she says, calling for discipline that is “respectful and restorative, not punitive. ”She also acknowledges friction between generations of teachers. Some experienced staff see empathy driven methods as too lenient, while younger teachers believe the emotional climate of classrooms has fundamentally changed. “Balancing kindness with authority is the real challenge,” she says, “but hurting a child’s confidence cannot be part of discipline.”Despite differing methods, both experienced and newer teachers agree on one point: emotional thresholds have shifted.If schools set one kind of pressure, coaching centres set another. With competitive exams acting as gateways to careers, families often invest high hopes and high fees into after school coaching. This intensifies expectations, and teachers in such environments navigate far thinner margins between motivation and harm.For Suman Prakash, the problem begins earlier, in parental choices. Many parents, he says, place their children in schools that do not match their socio economic reality. “They think a top school will help them, but it creates pressure. Parents worry about fees, children worry about matching the lifestyle of their peers,” he says. The result is an unequal emotional burden before a child even reaches the blackboard.A second shift, he argues, comes from the collapse of social outlets. “Earlier, if a teacher scolded us, we met friends, talked, laughed, released the stress. Children today have no such outlet. Everything is on the phone, no games, no informal support,” he explains. Without a peer space to process embarrassment or fear, reprimands linger and intensify.He also highlights what he calls the “marks inflation bubble”. With schools awarding higher marks more frequently, students may develop a false sense of ability. “Someone with 50 per cent ability is scoring in the 80s. When reality hits, the fall is very hard,” he says. In this environment, even a routine scolding can feel like a personal crisis, especially for students conditioned to believe that high marks validate worth.Prakash recalls an incident from his institute where a girl skipped class but accidentally revealed this by leaving her lunchbox behind. When her mother rushed to the centre, he urged her not to confront the girl immediately. “Children panic easily, and confrontation at the wrong moment can push them into extreme decisions,” he says. The matter was resolved privately the next day, avoiding both escalation and humiliation.The anecdote shows how small missteps can become high stakes events when fear replaces communication.The Delhi student’s death has also exposed structural weaknesses in school safety systems. Classmates have said he approached a school counsellor about suicidal thoughts, but was allegedly dismissed as joking. Teachers named in his note have been questioned and internal inquiries are ongoing. These gaps are not unusual, because many Indian schools have only one counsellor for hundreds of students, inconsistent complaint mechanisms and limited training for teachers on trauma informed discipline.With rising academic pressure and limited mental health infrastructure, punishment often becomes the default response to underperformance or behavioural issues, rather than a carefully calibrated tool.This creates a cycle that students struggle to break. A reprimand leads to shame, shame leads to fear of parental reaction, fear leads to silence and silence leaves children without any safe avenue to report distress.Across interviews, three themes emerge as essential for reform.First, teachers emphasise that discipline must be tied to behaviour, not character. Scolding that aims to correct can be valuable, but reprimand that aims to embarrass is counterproductive and risky.Second, the emotional environment of students must be recognised as fundamentally different from earlier decades. With higher expectations, sharper competition and reduced social outlets, children today process criticism with heightened sensitivity.Third, schools and families must rebuild channels of trust. The absence of safe spaces for children to express fear or failure allows humiliation, whether intended or not, to become destructive.As student suicides continue to rise, the cost of inaction becomes clearer. Punishment culture is not simply about tough love or maintaining discipline, it carries psychological weight that many children are no longer equipped to manage.","The death of a class 10 student in delhi, who allegedly named teachers in a suicide note, has placed renewed scrutiny on whether certain disciplinary practices have become psychologically unsafe.

More legislators are expected to follow. Last week, around ten MLAs had also met Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge.Shivakumar, who is also the state Congress chief, said on Tuesday that he doesn't want to speak on the matter in public as there was a ""secret deal"" between ""5-6 of us"" in the party and that he believes in his conscience.""I don't know. I have not asked to make me the CM. It is a secret deal between five and six of us. I don't want to speak publicly on this. I believe in my conscience. We should work with our conscience.

Marking a Political Milestone, Nitish Kumar Sworn In as Bihar CM for the 10th Time

ji

NEW DELHI: The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on Wednesday asserted that former Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi, wife of party supremo and ex-CM Lalu Prasad Yadav , will not vacate the government bungalow she has been living in for the past two decades, despite instructions to do so.The RJD's Bihar unit chief, Mangani Lal Mandal, made the remark a day after the state building construction department issued a notification directing Rabri Devi to shift to 39, Hardinge Road, which has been ""earmarked"" as the residence of the leader of the opposition in the legislative council, a post she currently holds.Speaking to reporters, Mandal said the residence at 10, Circular Road, situated directly across from chief minister Nitish Kumar ’s official residence at 1, Anney Marg, “will not be vacated, come what may.”He accused the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) of harbouring ""malice"" against Lalu Prasad Yadav: “Why did Nitish Kumar wait for two decades before earmarking a government bungalow for the leader of the opposition in the legislative council? And if it was necessary, why did the government not earmark 10, Circular Road? They should have considered that its occupants, Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi, have both served as chief ministers,” he told reporters, according to PTI.Mandal further alleged that Kumar, who leads the Janata Dal (United), took the decision to ask Rabri Devi to vacate the residence in order to “appease” Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP, the JD(U)’s alliance partner that emerged as the largest party in Bihar after the NDA’s recent assembly sweep.""Nitish Kumar has taken the decision to curry favour with the BJP. The JD(U) supremo has been rattled by the aggression of his alliance partner, which forced him to give up the Home portfolio he held so dear. Knowing the BJP’s ill-will towards Lalu, Nitish Kumar has tried to appease Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ilk by insulting our leader,"" Mandal added, warning the BJP not to “belittle” the RJD and its leaders.State minister Santosh Kumar Suman, however, pointed to a court ruling , noting that the bungalow had originally been allotted to Rabri Devi under a provision granting a “life-long” residence to former chief ministers.“That provision had to be scrapped following an Allahabad High Court ruling a few years ago. In any case, we are not depriving Rabri Devi of the bungalow. Moreover, the government has the right to decide which bungalow should be allotted to whom,” Suman noted.","Rabri devi will not vacate bungalow she has been living in for the past two decades.

Untold Bravery in Operation Sindoor: CISF Reveals It Foiled Pakistan Attack on Uri Hydro Power Plant

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's retaliation put the Uri hydroelectric plant near the Line of Control (LoC) under significant risk during a high-risk security situation that unfolded after India launched Operation Sindoor . However, the CISF successfully foiled the attempted attack, protecting both the power project and the residents living nearby.On Tuesday, the CISF honoured 19 of its personnel with the director general's disc for their extraordinary courage during this high-risk situation. The awards were presented at a ceremony in the CISF headquarters, where the leadership praised the team for safeguarding a critical national installation during intense cross-border shelling.The CISF provided counterterror security cover to the Uri Hydro Electric Power Projects (UHEP-I and II), located along the Jhelum river in Jammu and Kashmir’s Baramulla district, located 8-10 kms from the LoC.The personnel have been honoured and recognise for their door-to-door evacuation of civilians in the time of high military tensions. The troops evacuated women, children, NHPC (national hydroelectric power corporation) staff and their families -- amidst Pakistani shelling.""Their prompt and fearless actions ensured the safe evacuation of around 250 civilians, preventing any loss of life. Even as rounds landed dangerously close to the premises, the personnel continued to reinforce bunkers, maintain communication lines through POLNET and satellite systems, and provide emergency assistance,"" the statement said.The troops also neutralised ""hostile"" drones targeting Indian installations and secured armoury stockpiles by quickly redistributing weapons to avoid potential destruction, it added.Throughout the crisis, the ""integrity"" of critical national assets remained protected due to the vigilance and preparedness of the CISF personnel, the statement said.Commandant Ravi Yadav, along with deputy commandant Manohar Singh and assistant commandant Subash Kumar, led teams at Uri-I and Uri-II in initiating immediate protective measures for the installations and nearby townships.The personnel recognised include constables, head constables, inspectors and sub-inspectors from both Uri units. Among them are Constables Sushil Vasant Kamble, Raziqe Ahmad Abdul Rafique, Wankhede Ravindra Gulab, Tridev Chakma, Sohan Lal, Mufeed Ahmad, Mahesh Kumar and Sandenaboina Raju; Head Constables Gurjit Singh, Manoj Kumar Sharma and Ram Lal; Inspector Deepak Kumar Jha; Sub-inspectors Anil Kumar and Deepak Kumar; and Assistant Sub-Inspectors Rajeev Kumar and Sukhdev Singh.According to the CISF, ""They carried out real-time analysis of incoming shell trajectories, identified safe zones and organised the relocation of residents to bunker shelters.""India launched Operation Sindoor on the intervening night of May 6-7, under which 9 major terror hideouts were blown to bits in Pakistan and PoK. This counterterror action was taken as a strong retaliatory measure after a Pakistan-sponsored terrorist attack in South Kashmir's Pahalgam.","Pakistan's retaliation put the uri hydroelectric plant near the line of control (loc) under significant risk.

Mamata Banerjee Warns BJP With Nation-Shaking Threat As SIR Battle Erupts In Bengal Ahead Of Polls

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Wednesday wrote to Kolkata Police Commissioner Manoj Kumar Verma, raising alarm over a “serious security breach” during a protest by booth-level officers (BLOs) at the Chief Electoral Officer’s office in Kolkata.The poll body has directed the police to ensure the safety of its officials and submit an action-taken report within 48 hours.The letter was issued following a security breach on Monday during a protest by booth-level officers (BLOs) outside the Chief Electoral Officer’s office in Kolkata, where some demonstrators attempted to force entry, prompting police intervention and a brief scuffle.“It has come to the notice of ECI that on 24.11.2025 a serious security breach has occurred at the office of the Chief Electoral Officer, West Bengal, which has also been widely reported in Media,” the letter read.The poll body warned that the situation could endanger senior election officials.“The existing security in the office of the CEO appeared to be inadequate to handle the situation, which could lead to threat to the safety and security of the Chief Electoral Officer, Additional Chief Electoral Officers, Joint Chief Electoral Officers, Deputy Chief Electoral Officers and other officers and staff working in the office of the Chief Electoral Officer,” it said.The Commission has asked the police to ensure safety at the office, at residences of officials and during their travel.“The Commission has taken a serious view of the incident and directs that the Police Authorities should take all possible measures to ensure safety and security of officers and staff posted in the office of the CEO, at their residences and while commuting to and fro,” the letter stated.It further sought heightened security due to “sensitivity involved” ahead of upcoming elections in the state.“The Commission further directs that adequate security classification shall be done on account of sensitivity involved due to SIR activities and forthcoming elections in the State and ensure that no untoward incident occurs again. An action taken report may be sent to the Commission within 48 Hours of receipt of this letter,"" it further read.The breach occurred during a demonstration by booth-level officers outside the CEO’s office. Their protest march began around 1pm from College Street and reached the NSC Bose Road office at approximately 2.30pm.BLOs have alleged “inhumane stress” from the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls. Authorities had barricaded the entrance, but protesters tried to scale it, leading to a scuffle with police.At least 13 representatives were later allowed inside to submit a memorandum demanding an extension of deadlines and relief from online data-upload duties.Their agitation came days after the deaths of two BLOs, with families blaming excessive workload. Another officer suffered a cerebral attack, further fuelling anger among workers.West Bengal CEO Manoj Kumar Agarwal earlier said BLOs were “heroes” of the electoral process and assured that no action would be taken against them for genuine errors.The situation has intensified an already sharp confrontation between the state government and the ECI.On Monday, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee wrote to Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, flagging what she called two “disturbing yet urgent developments” ahead of polls.She criticised a centralised proposal by the CEO to outsource data entry staff:In her letter, Mamata wrote: “When district offices already have a substantial number of competent professionals performing such functions, what necessitates the CEO's initiative to outsource the same work through an external agency for a full year?”She also objected to a plan to set up polling stations inside private residential complexes, calling it “deeply problematic”.""It has further been brought to my attention that the Election Commission is considering setting up polling stations within private residential complexes, and DEOs have been asked to provide recommendations.This proposal is deeply problematic. Polling stations have always been-and must remain-located in government or semi-government institutions, preferably within a 2 km radius, to ensure accessibility and neutrality,"" Banerjee wrote in her letter.Banerjee appealed to the ECI to act “with utmost seriousness, impartiality and transparency.”The Special Intensive Revision exercise, which began on November 4, will conclude on December 4 and draft electoral rolls are scheduled for publication on December 9. Elections in West Bengal are scheduled next year.","The poll body has directed the police to ensure the safety of its officials.

NEW DELHI: Senior IAS officer Santosh Verma, state president of the Anusuchit Jati-Janjati Adhikari Karmachari Sangh (AJJAKS) in Madhya Pradesh, has drawn sharp criticism after a video of a remark he made at an event in Bhopal went viral, prompting demands for a police case and disciplinary action.Speaking on whether reservation should be granted on economic basis he said, ""until a Brahmin donates his daughter to my son or has a relationship with him, reservations should continue.”The All India Brahmin Society condemned Verma’s statement, its state president Pushpendra Mishra termed the comment “indecent” and “casteist,” alleging that it insults Brahmin daughters and violates All India Services Conduct Rules.In a post on X Mishra said ""An FIR should be lodged immediately for comments made against Brahmin daughters. The IAS officer's remarks are indecent, objectionable, and an insult to the Brahmin community. If a criminal case is not filed soon, the Brahmin Samaj will launch a statewide protest.""He added that the comments were inappropriate at a time when schemes such as Ladli Laxmi, Ladli Behna, and Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao focus on the dignity and welfare of girls.He warned that it would pursue both legal and street-level agitation if the government fails to act. “The government should immediately take the strictest possible action against IAS officer Santosh Verma, otherwise the Brahmin society will fight against IAS officer Santosh Verma in court as well as on the road,” Mishra said.Amid the escalating controversy, Verma issued a clarification, stating that his comments were taken out of context during a discussion on whether reservation should be linked to economic criteria.He told ANI, ""my aim was not to create a political uproar… I had said that if I am financially independent and not socially backward anymore, then my children should receive 'roti-beti' treatment from society. I don't have ill will against any community. I did not want to hurt women's sentiments. I express regret if I have hurt anyone. But some people propagated only a portion of what I had said.""","Santosh verma, state president of the anusuchit jati-janjati adhikari karmachari sangh (ajjaks) in madhya pradesh, has drawn sharp criticism after a video of a remark he made at an event in bhopal went viral.
