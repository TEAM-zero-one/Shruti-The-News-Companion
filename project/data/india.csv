NEW DELHI: The Congress on Sunday launched a sharp attack on the Maharashtra government, claiming that law and order in the state has “collapsed” following the alleged rape and suicide of a woman doctor in Satara. The grand old party also accused the state’s home department of being “bankrupt.”Congress leader Vijay Wadettiwar said, “The Home Department of Maharashtra is bankrupt. The law and order situation has completely collapsed... Ordinary people don't even have the courage to go to the police station... The police have become vagrants, resorting to hooliganism...”Deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde, meanwhile, condemned the incident and assured that the accused would face strict action. “The accused have been arrested. The incident is condemnable and unfortunate. In this case, none of the accused will be let go, there will be very harsh punishment, and the whole matter will go to the fast-track court,” Shinde said.Maharashtra minister Pankaja Gopinath Munde also met the victim’s family in Phaltan and expressed support and solidarity, assuring them of justice.Earlier, Satara Police arrested two individuals -- Police Sub-Inspector Gopal Badne and Prashant Bankar — in connection with the case.The two have been booked under charges of rape and abetment to suicide. PSI Badne, who was named in the suicide note, has been suspended, officials confirmed.Authorities said the woman doctor died by suicide on Friday, leaving behind a message written on her hand that mentioned a police officer and two others.The victim’s cousin alleged that she had been facing sustained political and police pressure related to her professional duties. “There was a lot of police and political pressure on her to make wrong mortem reports. She tried to complain about it. My sister should get justice,” the cousin told ANI.“She was under a lot of political and police pressure for the last year. Medical staff at the hospital are also involved. Everyone forced her to make wrong postmortem reports and forge fitness certificates. She was being forced to perform more and more postmortems despite other officers being present at the hospital,” the cousin added.The family suspects that another suicide note may exist, suggesting that the doctor had been documenting her complaints and distress in writing. Another relative demanded exemplary punishment, saying, “The accused should get the strictest of punishment.”The Federation of All India Medical Association (FAIMA) has condemned the death of Dr Sampada Mundhe and called for an immediate and transparent investigation into the case.","Congress leader vijay wadettiwar said, “the home department of maharashtra is bankrupt.

MUMBAI: The Dindoshi Special Pocso Court acquitted a 35-year-old man accused of repeatedly raping his minor daughter, citing lack of evidence and contradictions in the prosecution's case.Criticising the police for a shoddy investigation, the court said that the investigating officer failed to record a supplementary statement of the victim after receiving the medical papers and did not seize the clothes of the victim and accused for forensic analysis.Special Judge Smt Ashwini D Lokhande, while acquitting the father, said that he was in judicial custody since his arrest in 2019 when the case was registered by Kandivli police station.According to the public prosecutor, Geeta Malankar, the alleged incidents took place between 2020 and 2022, when the victim was aged between 8 and 10 years.However, the Special Pocso Court observed that the victim's testimony did not support the allegation of sexual assault.In her deposition, the girl stated that her father beat her and her mother after an argument over mobile phone use but did not mention any act of sexual assault.The judge noted that she retracted from her earlier statements to the police and before the magistrate and did not provide any incriminating evidence against the accused.The victim's mother, who was also examined as a witness, denied the allegation that her husband committed any sexual act with their daughter.She claimed the police did not read the contents of the complaint to her before she signed it.The court also noted that there were frequent quarrels between the couple, and the mother often stayed at her maternal home, indicating family discord.The medical evidence, too, did not support the prosecution. The doctor who examined the child, did not find any internal or external injuries on the victim's private parts and gave no opinion regarding sexual assault in her report.""The evidence of the prosecution witnesses is not sufficient to prove the charges. There is no iota of evidence to draw any adverse inference against the accused,"" the court observed.

West Bengal Police Arrest Three in Connection with Durgapur Gang-Rape Case

My mother treated Phaltan doctor like own daughter: Sister of arrested techie





PUNE: The Satara police arrested a techie and a police sub-inspector on Saturday in connection with the alleged rape and abetment of suicide of a 28-year-old doctor employed at the Phaltan subdistrict hospital.While the techie was arrested early in the morning, the police sub-inspector surrendered before the Phaltan rural police late in the night, a senior police officer said.“A court remanded the techie in four-day police custody till Oct 28,” said Satara superintendent of police Tushar Doshi.The brother and sister of the techie, speaking to TOI, denied the claim that he was arrested from a farmhouse in Pune. “My brother was arrested from our house in Phaltan. We had called him and told him to surrender. His social media records and call details have been given to the police. My brother never called the doctor. Instead, it was the doctor who used to call him repeatedly and harass him,” said the brother of the accused.Doctors’ associations in the state demanded transfer of the case to the state CID/ SIT to ensure an “independent, fair, and transparent investigation”.The doctor had been paying a monthly rent of Rs 4,000 to the family of the accused and residing at the place for the past year.The techie’s younger sister said, “Last month, my brother came to Phaltan to recover from dengue infection. At that time, this doctor treated him, and they exchanged numbers. Some 15 days ago, the doctor proposed marriage to my brother. My brother turned down the proposal. During Diwali, the doctor seemed tense, but we thought it might be a work-related issue. She was like a family member to us, and my mother used to treat her like her own daughter. ”The police said during questioning on Saturday, the arrested techie also claimed that the doctor used to harass him by insisting that he marry her and maintain a physical relationship with her. “A large number of chats and call recordings between the accused and the deceased have been found in which she is speaking about stress, pressure, etc.” a police officer said.The police are also investigating whether the accused sub-inspector — who is also named in the FIR for rape and suicide abetment, and comes from Beed, the same district as the doctor — knew her or had any relationship with her.Following the doctor’s suicide, police discovered a note written on her palm, naming the sub-inspector and the landlord’s son for driving her to take the extreme step by subjecting her to physical and mental harassment over the past five months. Based on this note and other evidence, such as WhatsApp chats exchanged between the doctor and the techie, an FIR was registered on Friday under sections 64 (rape) and 108 (abetment of suicide) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) against the two suspects.SP Tushar Doshi said, “A woman ended her life, and there might be some truth to her allegations. We are trying to establish everything. It is a challenging case as she had not complained about this earlier. Technical evidence and WhatsApp chats will be verified, but again, that can only prove that there was sexual contact. Whether there was any blackmail angle is what the investigation will bring to the fore.”Doctors’ associations in the state demanded the transfer of the case to the state CID/SIT to ensure an independent, fair, and transparent investigation, insisting on a time-bound completion of the inquiry and the public release of its findings.Additionally, the associations are seeking accountability from administrative officers who allegedly ignored repeated complaints.Dr Sachin Patil, the president of Central Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD), said, “We have written to the chief minister to personally intervene in this issue and to ensure that the case is handled with utmost seriousness. There is a sense of immense grief and collective outrage amongst the medical fraternity. As per statements from her colleagues, the doctor repeatedly informed her seniors about being mentally and physically harassed by the two men. Despite clear warnings that she was under extreme distress, no effective preventive action was taken by the administration.”The Central MARD, Association of Medical Officers (AMO), and Federation of All India Medical Association (FAIMA) have condemned the tragic death and held black ribbon protest on Saturday. In a note issued by these organisations, they have demanded immediate action and warned that if their demands are not met, doctors will intensify their agitation and initiate statewide protests.Additionally, Health Rights NGO Jan Aarogya Abhiyan (JAA) has written to the CM requesting the case be registered as “institutional murder’. Dr Abhay Shukla, the national co-convenor of JAA, said, “We believe that the death of this young doctor is caused by patriarchal attitudes, administrative apathy, and negligence within the system. We demand an independent judicial inquiry committee and also request the govt to implement a ‘Women’s Safety Policy’ in all govt hospitals across Maharashtra. ”CM Devendra Fadnavis on Friday spoke to the Satara SP and directed the immediate suspension of the sub-inspector named in the note.","The satara police arrested a techie and a police sub-inspector on saturday in connection with the alleged rape and abetment of suicide of a 28-year-old doctor employed at the phaltan subdistrict hospital.

MIG police register FIR following Simmons’ plaint





INDORE : Two Australian women cricketers were allegedly stalked and molested by a man on a street here on Thursday morning. The cricketers, who reached Indore on Oct 17 to participate in their group match against South Africa on Saturday in the ICC Women’s World Cup, were accosted while they were going to a café in the city’s Saket area from their hotel around 11am in Indore’s upmarket Vijay Nagar area.Police have arrested the accused, Akil Khan, after going through CCTV footage following a complaint by Australian team’s security manager Danny Simmons late on Thursday evening.According to the FIR filed by Simmons, the incident happened barely 500m from the team hotel when a bikeborne person rode up to them twice and molested them before fleeing the area.“The incident was brought to the notice of the police by BCCI. Multiple teams were deployed, and after extensive effort, the accused was traced and apprehended. He attempted to flee and even tried to jump into a sewage drain. Based on the complaint of the Australian team’s security manager, a case was registered at MIG police station,” Indore police commissioner Santosh Kumar Singh said on Saturday.“Whenever an international event is underway, specific security protocols are laid down by all stakeholders involved.An investigation will determine at which level those protocols failed or were not followed,” said Singh.“A case was registered on Thursday night and the accused identified and arrested in an intensive strategic operation,” additional DCP (crime branch) Rajesh Dandotiya said.Also watch: Accused in Australian cricketers’ molestation case caught on video limping None of the Australian players appeared at the ceremonial post-match press conference at Holkar Stadium on Saturday, despite a commanding win over South Africa. Australian coach Shelley Nitschke represented the team, addressing the media while the team chose not to respond to questions regarding the incident.Australia defeated South Africa in a commanding display at Holkar Stadium, restricting them to a total of just 97 runs. The match, which drew hundreds of fans eager to witness the ICC Women’s World Cup clash, was the final fixture of the tournament scheduled in the city.“We had received a complaint from the security manager of the Australian team stating that two female players had faced inappropriate behaviour while walking to a cafe from their hotel on Thursday morning. A case was registered on Thursday night at MIG police station and the accused Akil Khan was identified and arrested in an intensive strategic operation. He was produced before the court and sent to jail on Saturday,” additional DCP (crime branch) Rajesh Dandotiya said.A total of five matches, including the Australia-South Africa clash on Saturday, have been held at the Holkar Stadium here and many of the teams have stayed at the same hotel. Following Simmons’ complaint, lodged at MIG police station late on Thursday evening, an FIR was registered under Sections 74 and 78 of the BNS for assault or criminal force on a woman with intent to outrage her modesty and stalking.According to the FIR, the incident took place around 11am when the two players had stepped out of the hotel to visit a nearby café after informing Simmons.“At approximately 11am, two players advised me they were leaving the hotel to go to a cafe. They were planning to walk to the cafe and I had no concerns with this as they had previously been to the cafe as have several members of the Australian team,” Simmons mentioned in the FIR.“I received a live location notification from one of the players on my mobile phone at 11.08am. This message signifies an emergency distress signal to me from a player to advise they may need assistance. The players were about 500m from the hotel when she sent me a message saying a man on a motorcycle had approached them and tried to grab one of them before being confronted. He again came behind another player and touched her inappropriately before he drove off,” the FIR said.The incident took place in Indore’s MIG area, primarily a marketplace, between their hotel and the café in Saket.Simmons said that the player texted him, “Hey SoS, just sending you my live location... there’s a guy following us trying to grab us.”The man was described as around 30 years old, wearing a white shirt and black cap, and riding a black motorcycle without a helmet.The team’s liaison officers were informed and directed to go to the location to assist the players. A police patrol unit later reached the spot and escorted the cricketers back to their hotel. The complaint stated that the player later messaged again, informing Simmons that local police had arrived and helped them return safely.“I received a further message stating that a nice man in a suit in a car stopped and asked if we were alright and stated that he rang police with the guy’s bike number,” Simmons mentioned in the FIR.Ayush Jain, owner of the café, which is about 5km from the hotel the Australian team was staying in, told TOI, “Many of the Australian team members have been visiting our café in groups of threefour ever since they reached Indore on Oct 17. Nobody in the neighbourhood knew their identity, except us, since the café is thronged by many foreigners who check into nearby hotels.Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association (MPCA) on Saturday said it is examining “whether the players had sought security cover for the movement outside the hotel.”“The Australian team has a security officer appointed by Cricket Australia along with two security officers appointed by BCCI and the local police. It shall be examined whether the players had sought security cover or not,"" MPCA chief administrative officer Rohit Pandit told TOI .“Extremely pained and hurt by the unfortunate incident that took place with the two members of the Australian women’s cricket team. No woman deserves to face such inappropriate behaviour. This incident is painful for not just the players but for the state and city too. Madhya Pradesh, especially Indore, has always been known for its hospitality, ensuring respect and safety for its guests. This inappropriate behaviour by one person has harmed this reputation and we are all extremely sorry for this,” MPCA president Mahanaryaman Scindia posted on X.","2 australian cricketers molested in indore on thursday morning.

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

CHANDIGARH: Justice Surya Kant, the most senior Supreme Court judge, is poised to assume the office of Chief Justice of India (CJI) next month. Few are aware of the extraordinary journey that brought him to the nation's highest judicial position.Unlike many who come from families with strong legal background, Justice Kant's journey began in Petwar - a nondescript village in Haryana's Hisar. He grew up far from privileges often associated with corridors of power. The first time he saw a city was when he travelled to Hansi, a small town in Hisar, for his Class X board exam.Until Class VIII, he studied in a village school that had no benches. As a student, he shared everyday responsibilities of rural life - working in fields during his spare time to support his family like any other rural boy. His father was a teacher.On formal confirmation, he will be the first Haryanvi to become CJI. He is expected to take over as 53rd Chief Justice of India on Nov 24, and slated to serve until Feb 9, 2027.Those who have worked closely with him describe Justice Kant as a jurist of deep learning and measured wisdom, admired for his balanced judgments and unwavering commitment to justice. Having served for over 14 years in Punjab and Haryana HC before his elevation as Himachal Pradesh HC Chief Justice and later as SC judge, he has consistently demonstrated a keen sensitivity toward matters concerning protection of public resources, land acquisition and compensation, victims' rights, reservation policies, and broader balance of constitutional principles.Sometime ago, while visiting his alma mater, Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak, Justice Kant spoke about his early life and modest beginnings. Electricity was a rarity in Petwar, he recalled and fondly remembered studying at night with friends, huddled under dim lamps, driven by hope of securing a govt job - a goal, he said, inspired him to persevere through every hardship.Born on Feb 10, 1962, Justice Kant completed his early education from Petwar and LLB in 1984 from MDU. He started as a lawyer at Hisar district court before moving to Chandigarh to practice at Punjab and Haryana HC.Justice Kant became the youngest advocate general of Haryana at 38. In 2004, aged 42, he was elevated as a judge of Punjab and Haryana HC. Even then, he continued his academic pursuits, securing first-class-first in his master's degree in law in 2011 from Kurukshetra University's directorate of distance education.After serving as HC judge for over 14 years, he was elevated as Himachal Pradesh HC CJ on Oct 5, 2018. On May 24, 2019, he became SC judge.In his 14-year stint as HC judge in Chandigarh, Justice Kant passed several landmark judgments, including right of jail inmates to have conjugal visits or artificial insemination for progeny.He also passed an order in a case where a husband had killed his wife. While punishing the guilty, he noticed the accused had four daughters. He personally spoke with a college principal, requesting free education for the eldest daughter.In Punjab and Haryana HC, he was part of the full bench that ordered sanitisation of Dera Sacha Sauda in 2017 following violence after imprisonment of the Dera chief in rape cases and directed a central probe into financial irregularities inside it. He served as a member of governing body of National Legal Services Authority from 2007 to 2011. In SC, he was part of benches that passed several landmark judgments.As CJ of Himachal Pradesh HC, he focused on administrative reforms and improving judicial efficiency. He reaffirmed access to basic amenities constituted an integral part of the fundamental right to life enshrined in the Constitution.",Justice surya kant will be the first haryanvi to become cji.

Bihar Assembly Polls: EC Announces Two-Phase Voting, Unveils 17 New Measures For Transparent Voting

Unlike Bihar, pan-India SIR to be announced at press meet

Also read-

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission will on Monday announce the first phase of the pan-India special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, covering 10-15 states/UTs, including poll-bound West Bengal, Tamil Nadu , Kerala, Assam and Puducherry.Sources in the poll body said the initial phase will leave out states like Maharashtra, where local body elections are to be held by Jan 31, 2026, as per Supreme Court directives, as well as the snow-bound states/UTs of J&K, Himachal, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Ladakh. The last intensive revision of electoral rolls in India was undertaken two decades ago.Ahead of the EC presser, Tamil Nadu CM and DMK chief M K Stalin accused BJP of ""plotting to remove names from voter list"" ahead of state polls, as in Bihar . ""It (SIR) deprived nearly 65 lakh voters in poll-bound Bihar of their voting rights,"" he alleged.DMK and other INDIA bloc parties have warned that BJP govt is ""attempting to use EC as its puppet to replicate the same in Tamil Nadu"", Stalin said in a letter to the party cadre.""BJP and its ally AIADMK believe that if the names of voters from the working class, minorities, scheduled castes, women and the poor are deleted through SIR, they can secure victory without facing the people.But this calculation will fail in Tamil Nadu,"" he said.Unlike Bihar, where EC launched SIR with a written order, the pan-India exercise will be announced at a press conference, allowing any queries and doubts to be addressed on the spot.Sources indicated that the nationwide SIR shall be announced and conducted in stages, with three broad categories of states/UTs likely to witness the exercise later. These include states/UTs that will soon be in the grip of harsh winter and snow; ones where local body polls are due over the next three months and which are held with electoral rolls prepared as per provisions of the Representation of the People Act; and where at least 75%-80% of the electorate has already been mapped by matching current electors with entries in the roll from the last intensive revision, requiring only the remaining 20% or so to submit documents to prove their eligibility as per Article 326 of the Constitution.EC sources said the list of documents to be accepted as proof of eligibility will more or less remain the same as in Bihar and will only be indicative and not exhaustive. Aadhaar will only be accepted as proof of identity.Going by the three-month SIR schedule followed in Bihar, the enrolment stage for the first phase of SIR - requiring the elector to sign the enrolment form and, where required, submit proof of eligibility - may start on Nov 1 and the final roll published, after settling claims and objections to the draft roll, by Jan end or beginning of Feb.The groundwork for the upcoming countrywide SIR - the intent for which was announced by EC in its June 24 notification for SIR in Bihar - has been under way for the past two months, with two separate conferences of chief electoral officers held by EC in Sept and Oct. The last CEOs conference on Oct 22-23 saw EC assessing the preparedness of all state/UT CEO offices, particularly progress of the mapping of their current electors with the roll from the last intensive revision.With Bihar having shown the way, sources said, CEOs are better prepared for the SIR and the EC's confident of pulling off a cleaner, error-free electoral roll after removing duplicate entries, illegal immigrants, and dead or shifted voters. All state/UT rolls are digitised and map-ped with the roll from the last SIR, with 50%-70% electors already linked to it; booth level officers have been trained and parties urged to appoint enough booth level agents.","Ec will on monday announce the first phase of the pan-india special intensive revision (sir) of electoral rolls. Initial phase will leave out states like maharashtra, where local body elections are to be held by jan 31, 2026. Tamil nadu cm and dmk chief m k stalin accused bjp of ""plotting to remove names from voter list"" ahead of state polls.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124836986,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-12824,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

KOLKATA: Centre has moved Supreme Court challenging a Calcutta HC order on Sept 26 to repatriate Sunali Khatun and five others, who were pushed into Bangladesh on the grounds of being illegal immigrants, within four weeks.Centre's petition, filed on Oct 22, comes amid reports the families of the six, who are from Bengal's Birbhum and were rounded up in New Delhi, are planning to plead with HC for an order to Indian authorities to implement the repatriation order. The four-week period during which Sunali, husband Danish Sheikh, their 8-year-old son Sabir, Sweety Bibi and her two minor sons were to be brought back home ended on Oct 24.A habeas corpus petition filed by Sunali's father Bhodu Sheikh in HC in Aug mentioned that she was eight months pregnant.

"CAC Member Flags RERA Gaps, Urges Mandatory Declaration from Builders on Pending Dues",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cac-member-flags-rera-gaps-urges-mandatory-declaration-from-builders-on-pending-dues/articleshow/124830762.cms,"An AI-generated image

NEW DELHI: A member of the government’s Central Advisory Council (CAC) has told the housing ministry that mandatory registration of real estate projects under RERA has become meaningless as it doesn’t ensure compliance or protect homebuyers. He has urged the ministry to make mandatory the submission of a “declaration” by builders and their group entities before registration of any project, confirming that all dues to buyers, the authorities and courts in other projects have been cleared.In a letter to housing minister Manohar Lal Khattar, CAC member Abhay Upadhyay has suggested that any false declaration by builders result in such promoters being barred permanently from real estate business across India and imposition of heavy penalties on them.Upadhyay, who also heads FPCE, a pan-India homebuyers’ organisation, has sought urgent govt intervention to plug critical gaps in the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), which continue to leave buyers vulnerable to exploitation by builders. The homebuyers’ body has urged the ministry to issue standard operating procedures (SOPs) to all state RERA bodies until formal amendments are made to the Act.“Unlike FSSAI , where the stamp itself instills confidence that the product is safe for consumption, the RERA registration number has failed to become a symbol of trust. Instead, it has become a mere formality that builders flaunt while continuing to flout the law,” the FPCE said. It pointed out that many RERA authorities have not exercised the powers provided to them under the law to penalise errant developers or ensure compliance with their orders.Raising the issue of builders failing to complete or inordinately delaying promised amenities such as clubhouses, swimming pools and landscaped gardens, FPCE said that the existing provisions, which deal only with compensation for delay in possession, are “grossly inadequate”. It urged the ministry to issue SOPs to RERA bodies to ensure developers deposit adequate funds in escrow accounts for completion of such amenities and also compensate buyers until these are completed and made functional.The FPCE has further sought a clear exit policy for homebuyers to remove the uncertainty following a recent Supreme Court judgment that distinguished between ‘genuine homebuyers’ and ‘speculative investors’. It proposed that buyers be entitled to a full refund within one year of booking and a 90% refund thereafter, to ensure fairness and predictability.It also recommended barring developers from collecting more than 75% of the unit cost, with the remaining 25% being collected only after the project is complete in all respects and completion certificate is obtained.",A member of the government’s central advisory council has told the housing ministry that mandatory registration of real estate projects under rera has become meaningless.

Even today, Parliament closes each session with an instrumental version rather than a vocal rendition.Modi also recalled how the song's first public rendition was by Rabindranath Tagore at the 1896 session of Congress. ""Vande Mataram was composed 150 years ago, and in 1896, Tagore sang it for the first time,"" he said.Modi also paid tribute to Komaram Bheem - the tribal leader who spearheaded the Gond rebellion against the British and feudal Nizams of Hyderabad in 1928 - as well as tribal icon and freedom fighter Birsa Munda ahead of his birth anniversary on Nov 15, celebrated as 'Janajateeya Gaurav Diwas'.
