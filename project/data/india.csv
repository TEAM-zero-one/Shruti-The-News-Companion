"Astronaut, IISc prof pitch for back-up control for safer re-entry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/astronaut-iisc-prof-pitch-for-back-up-control-for-safer-re-entry/articleshow/121388989.cms,"BENGALURU: Isro astronaut Group Captain Angad Pratap and Assistant Professor Jishnu Keshavan from IISc, are in the final phases of their research to demonstrate the viability of a manual control system as an additional safety measure during the critical atmospheric re-entry phase of a manned spacecraft returning to Earth.The re-entry phase involves complex aerodynamics and narrow margins for error. Too steep an entry could lead to excessive heating, while too shallow a path risks the capsule skipping off the atmosphere. Pratap and Keshavan’s research focuses on a possible scenario of a failure in the primary automatic Navigation, Guidance and Control (NGC) system of a crew module during re-entry.To address this, the team explored whether an astronaut could manually guide the spacecraft in such conditions with support from a partially degraded NGC system. Their system is not being designed to replace the primary NGC architecture but to complement it.The objective of automated guidance during re-entry is to ensure accurate tracking of a predefined reference trajectory all the way to touchdown. This requires designing a guidance law capable of countering potential disturbances that could otherwise alter the spacecraft’s descent profile and cause deviations from the intended landing point—an outcome that must be avoided in practice.As per the abstract of their research presented at the recently concluded Global Space Exploration Conference (GLEX-2025), to mitigate this possibility, the study explored the feasibility of incorporating “a novel bank-angle based manual control scheme in a manned spacecraft during re-entry in the atmospheric altitudes of 120km - 10 km”.“Bank-angle manipulation” used here is the same fundamental principle employed by automated systems, but adapted for human operation, as per the abstract titled “Robust Manual Guidance Law For Manned Spacecraft Re-Entry Applications”.Using sophisticated 6-DOF (six degree-of-freedom) modelling incorporating both translational and rotational dynamics, researchers demonstrated that human pilots could successfully guide a representative manned spacecraft from re-entry altitude to parachute deployment while maintaining all critical parameters within safe limits.Manual mode is proposed as an additional backup to the multiple chains of automated modes of reentry control in case of the flight profile either exceeding predefined perturbation models, or identical failure across all automated control chains.Incorporating this additional degree of manual redundancy may enhance mission reliability for the crew capsule. The manual control scheme was explored from the standpoint of guiding the manned spacecraft manually from a predefined reentry altitude to the terminal altitude thus guaranteeing subsequent touchdown at the predefined target location.The study describes the design and testing of a “reduced-order” flight display and manual control setup intended for emergency use. Drawing from operational precedents such as Nasa’s Apollo missions, the system provides a pilot with essential information through an intuitive interface. This would allow the crew to steer the capsule towards a pre-designated landing area, even in the absence of automated controls.","Group captain angad pratap and assistant professor jishnu keshavan from iisc are in the final phases of their research to demonstrate the viability of a manual control system.

Several parts of neighbouring Haryana, including Jhajjar, also witnessed heavy downpour.The IMD had on Saturday warned of a thunderstorm cell approaching Delhi and adjoining areas from the west and northwest. “Under its influence, severe thunderstorm or dust-raising wind activity accompanied by frequent lightning and gusty winds (speed reaching 40–60 km/h or more) will likely affect parts of the city in the next 1 to 2 hours,” the IMD said in a statement.The warning was part of the agency’s Nowcast alert system, based on immediate weather patterns. Authorities urged people to remain indoors and avoid open areas. “Avoid open spaces and not to take shelter under trees,” the IMD cautioned, also advising people to stay clear of weak walls, unstable structures, and water bodies.The weather event raised concerns over possible impacts, including uprooting of trees, falling branches, and moderate damage to crops like bananas and papayas.Dry limbs could snap and fall due to strong winds, and localised dust storms were also likely, the IMD said.Officials asked residents to remain alert and follow safety instructions as the weather remains volatile across the region.Severe waterlogging was reported in several parts of Delhi after heavy rains and thunderstorm struck the national capital in the early hours of Sunday. Areas affected include Moti Bagh, Minto Road, and near Delhi Airport Terminal 1.Visuals from Delhi's Minto Road show a car submerged due to severe waterlogging caused by the heavy rainfall. The heavy rain accompanied by thunderstorms also lashed several parts of Haryana's Jhajjar.This was the second major storm event in less than a week. On Wednesday, strong winds and a dust storm swept through Delhi, with wind speeds reaching 50–60 km/h, and gusts touching 70 km/h. Light rainfall was also reported, along with thunderstorms in parts of Haryana's Karnal district.The mid-week storm had caused widespread power outages across the capital. Neighbourhoods such as Bawana, Narela, Jahangirpuri, Civil Lines, Shakti Nagar, Model Town, Wazirabad, Dhirpur, and Burari faced disruptions in electricity supply. According to Tata Power DDL, power was deliberately suspended in some areas to prevent electrocution, as trees and branches fell on live wires, damaging infrastructure.","Heavy rain, thunderstorms, and high-speed winds lashed delhi and parts of the national capital region late saturday night.

Conditions favourable for advance of SW monsoon

.

NEW DELHI: The southwest (summer) monsoon hit Kerala on Saturday, eight days ahead of its normal onset date of June 1, marking the beginning of the four-month-long rainy season in India. This is the earliest date of monsoon onset over Kerala after 2009 when it set in over the state on May 23, said India Meteorological Department (IMD).Besides showers in Kerala and other parts of south peninsula, including Tamil Nadu and parts of Karnataka, the monsoon on Saturday simultaneously arrived in Mizoram (NE) - 12 days before the normal onset date of June 5.Though the monsoon's arrival simultaneously over Kerala and NE is quite an uncommon phenomenon, this time it has happened second year in a row. Before 2024, simultaneous onset happened on May 30, 2017.Normally southwest monsoon sets in over Kerala on June 1 and it advances over most part of northeast India by June 5. Advance of the monsoon to most parts of Tamil Nadu and some parts of Karnataka on the very first day of the onset is significant but not unusual. It, however, signals the possibility of its fast progress in the next few days.""Monsoon arrival in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu is not unusual. It invariably happens and the monsoon will now make further progress as per our forecast,"" IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra told TOI. Announcing the monsoon onset, the Met department said the conditions are favourable for further advance of southwest monsoon into entire Goa, some parts of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, some more parts of Karnataka, remaining parts of Tamil Nadu, some more parts of northeastern states, and some parts of sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim during the next 2-3 days.Early monsoon onset and its further advance will pave the way for early start of the kharif (summer crops) sowing operations in the country, specifically in south and central India. Since the IMD predicted 'above normal' monsoon rainfall in most parts of the country this year, the situation may help increase the acreage and production of the summer crops such as paddy, pulses, maize and other coarse cereals and steer the country towards realising its goal of record foodgrains output of 354 million tonne in the 2025-26 crop year.On Saturday, the monsoon advanced into the entire Lakshadweep area, Kerala, Mahe, some parts of Karnataka, remaining parts of Maldives and Comorin area, many parts of Tamil Nadu and some parts of Mizoram. IMD, meanwhile, predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall over west coast (Kerala, Karnataka, coastal Maharashtra & Goa) during the next seven days; coastal and ghat areas of Karnataka till May 27; and ghat areas of Tamil Nadu on May 25-26 due to prevailing weather phenomena.","The southwest (summer) monsoon hit kerala on saturday, eight days ahead of its normal onset date of june 1.

Telangana proposes national task force for holistic metro development



NEW DELHI: From 50% share in central taxes to solving water disputes, non-Bharatiya Janata Party states presented a myriad demands at the Niti Aayog meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday.This year’s meeting centered on the theme ‘Viksit Rajya for Viksit Bharat@2047’, highlighting the crucial role of states in driving India’s transformation into a developed nation by 2047, according to a press release from Niti Aayog.Additionally, PM Modi categorically pressed upon the importance for a Centre-state cooperation for a developed nation. ""If Centre and states work together like Team India, no goal is impossible,"" he said.The non-BJP states that attended the meeting include Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Punjab. States like West Bengal, Kerala and Karnataka skipped the meeting.Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin has demanded 50% share of states in central taxes and urged the Union government to release Rs 2,200 crore in pending funds under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), withheld because the state had not signed a MoU with the Union education ministry for the ""PM Shri"" scheme.""Particularly, nearly Rs 2,200 crore of Union funds have been denied to Tamil Nadu in the year 2024-2025.

This will affect the development of the state and nation, as well,"" he added.Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann accused the central government of meeting out a ""step motherly"" treatment to the state and warned against ""discriminatory treatment"".Amid the ongoing dispute over water sharing, the chief minister emphasized that given the state's worsening water crisis, constructing a Yamuna-Sutlej-Link (YSL) canal should be considered as an alternative to the Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal.He said that Punjab has repeatedly sought inclusion in negotiations over Yamuna water allocation, citing a 1954 agreement with Uttar Pradesh that granted the erstwhile Punjab two-thirds of the Yamuna waters. He noted the agreement didn’t specify irrigation areas and pointed out that, unlike the Ravi and Beas rivers, Yamuna waters were not considered during the Punjab-Haryana reorganization, despite the river originally flowing through Punjab.He raised concerns over the deployment of CISF personnel at the Bhakra Nangal Dam, stating that security has traditionally been managed by the respective states. He criticized the ministry of power’s decision to involve the CISF as unnecessary and disruptive to an effective existing system, arguing it undermines Punjab’s rights over the dams. He urged that the decision be revoked immediately.Telangana chief ministers A Revanth Reddy proposed the formation of a national task force, led by the prime minister and comprising the chief ministers of key states, to unlock the full economic potential of India’s six major metropolitan cities—Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Chennai, and Hyderabad. Addressing the Niti Aayog governing council in Delhi, he stressed the need to acknowledge the critical economic role these cities play in the nation's growth.""To harness their full potential, there is a pressing need to establish a national-level task force under the leadership of the Prime Minister and the respective chief ministers.

In 2024, he again chose not to attend, with Bihar being represented instead by deputy chief ministers Samrat Choudhary and Vijay Kumar Sinha.The council is the apex body of the Niti Ayog, which includes chief ministers, lieutenant governors of all states and Union territories along with several Union ministers. This was the first major meeting of the PM with chief ministers of all states and lieutenant governors after US President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs and Operation Sindoor.Despite the absence of some states, the meeting went ahead with participation from several state heads.PM Modi began the Niti Aayog meeting by advocating for joint development initiatives between the Centre and states. He stressed the importance of developing cities that are prepared for the future, considering India's growing urbanisation.“India is getting rapidly urbanised. We should work towards future-ready cities. Growth, innovation, and sustainability should be the engines of urban development,” the Prime Minister said.Highlighting the theme of “Team India,” PM Modi added, “We have to increase the speed of development. If the Centre and all States come together and work as a team, no goal is impossible.”The Prime Minister encouraged states to enhance tourism, recommending that each state should establish one internationally recognised tourist destination.“One State: One Global Destination should be our mantra. It will not only elevate that location but also lead to the development of surrounding areas,” he added.The Niti Aayog governing council meeting is a platform for the Centre and states/UTs to discuss how to work together to achieve the goal of a developed India by 2047.

SHIMLA: A day after Himachal Pradesh high court raised serious questions about an SIT probe under Shimla SP Sanjeev Gandhi and asked CBI to investigate state power corporation general manager Vimal Negi's mysterious death, Gandhi on Saturday attacked DGP Atul Verma for filing an ""ulteriorly motivated affidavit"" in the court in an alleged bid to insult him.Stating that he would rather resign than tolerate insults and questions about his professional integrity, Gandhi said he and members of the SIT had decided to challenge Friday's HC verdict with facts to expose the DGP's motives and how, he claimed, police headquarters had tried to implicate him.The SP said he has filed a petition in the HC seeking action against BJP MLA from Dharamshala Sudhir Sharma for allegedly circulating a video clip of the live-streaming of court proceedings in Negi's death case, held on May 21, without the court's permission. He claimed the MLA did this deliberately to malign his image since he is probing horse-trading allegations against Sharma and others in connection with last year's Rajya Sabha polls. He added that Sharma's action amounts to contempt of proceedings and violates copyright and information laws.In response, Sharma served a legal notice on Gandhi for claiming that he was the mastermind of last year's ""horse-trading"".Sharma told media that his name is not in the FIR pertaining to the alleged horse-trading, and that he was never called for investigation. He accused the Shimla SP of issuing misleading statements against him, asking what stopped police from filing a chargesheet against him if he was involved in horse-trading.Gandhi told reporters on Saturday that the SIT had carried out an honest investigation of Negi's death and that the DGP's status report in court was very irresponsible. He said he would soon expose how investigations conducted under him were being adversely impacted through what he alleged was a ""police headquarters and politico nexus"".He also announced plans to expose senior officers posted at police headquarters for holding a grudge against him. ""Someone wants an extension (service), someone wants posts, but Sanjeev Gandhi needs nothing except justice for Vimal Negi,"" the SP said.Gandhi claimed that the investigation revealed that a member of the DGP's staff has links with the Sanjay Bhuria gang, involved in drug trafficking.The SP also targeted former DGP Sanjay Kundu for allegedly hatching a conspiracy against him and projecting an LPG leak blast at an eatery in the city as an RDX blast through the National Security Guard (NSG) investigation.","Bjp mla released court clip to malign my image: shimla sp sanjeev gandhi.

NEW DELHI: The extent to which the legal system can take the poor and the ignorant for a ride, fleecing and exploiting them in the process, came to light when Supreme Court decided to find out the legal expenses of a woman from a small village in West Bengal in her fight to protect her husband. Shocking details emerged: she paid a tout who promised to secure bail and an additional amount to an advocate 'for winning the case'.The woman, who lives in a ramshackle dwelling with a tarpaulin sheet for a roof and no doors, ended up spending Rs 3.5 lakh from the trial court to the SC, which admitted that the legal system had failed her. The man was sentenced to 20 years by a Pocso court for having a physical relationship with the woman when she was a minor, and she fought to get him released.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan had appointed a committee to interact with the woman and the panel filed a report in a sealed envelope. In its judgment, the bench mentioned the findings of the panel which said she was now in a debt trap.""She had to run from pillar to post... She spent large amounts by way of payment of fees to lawyers for his release. The amount she spent as noted in the final report of the committee are startling,"" it said.At different stages, the woman paid a total of Rs 40,000 to advocates. In addition, she claims to have paid a sum of Rs 10,000 to an advocate 'for winning the case'. She spent a sum of Rs 20,000 to get copies of the chargesheet and Rs 7,000 for getting duplicate copies of court papers, court said.She paid Rs 18,000 to a tout who promised to get bail for her husband. Thus, she ended up spending over Rs 2 lakh (in trial court proceedings) by incurring debt for defending the accused. In fact, the committee records that the indebtedness has become vicious, the court said in its verdict.The woman had to approach high court and had to bear additional expenses of nearly Rs 1.4 lakh. As the apex court appointed two leading senior advocates as amici to assist the bench, she did not have to pay much in the SC.""The figures stated make it obvious that she has been exploited. This is evident from the fact that she had to pay Rs 60,000 for grant of bail, Rs 25,000 for securing acquittal, Rs 15,000 for filing a case in this court and Rs 25,000 towards air fare, to enable her husband's advocate to appear before this court,"" the bench said.The top court said that the family is very poor and staying in a temporary shelter enclosed by brick walls, but the roof is of tarpaulin with no door.It said the facts of this case were an eye-opener for everyone as it highlighted the lacunae in the legal system which failed her. ""In this case, the society, the family of the victim and the legal system have done enough injustice to the victim,"" the bench said.","Case an eye-opener for everyone, shows lacunae in legal system: sc.

Government should consider suggestion for a sex education policy: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-should-consider-suggestion-for-a-sex-education-policy-supreme-court/articleshow/121386196.cms,"Govt should consider suggestion for a sex education policy: SC

NEW DELHI: To ensure that adolescents don't get sent to jail under the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso) for being in romantic relationships, Supreme Court has directed the Centre to consider decriminalising such consensual relationships and frame a policy for sexual and reproductive health education in the country.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan issued notice to the Centre through the ministry of women and child development to form an expert committee to examine the issue and file a report before it by July 25. The court said it would pass further directions after getting the report.The trigger for the court order was the legal battle of a woman from West Bengal to protect her husband who was sentenced to 20 years in jail under Pocso for having a relationship with her when she was 14.The court had appointed two senior women advocates - Madhavi Divan and Liz Mathew - to assist it on the sensitive issue and they suggested that adolescents in consensual relationships needed to be protected. While Pocso Act served an essential purpose in protecting minors from sexual exploitation, its rigid application in cases of adolescent relationships could lead to outcomes that may not align with the best interests of the prosecutrix and her dependants, they suggested.Accepting the suggestions of the senior advocates, the court impleaded the Centre in the case and issued notice.The advocates also pointed out that various high courts, including Delhi and Madras, have taken a nuanced approach and interpreted the statement of objects and reasons of the Pocso Act as not intending to criminalise consensual romantic relationships. In several cases, Madras high court adopted a legal interpretation that consensual acts did not fulfil the requirement of 'assault' in the offence of 'penetrative sexual assault'.Calcutta HC held that Pocso Act defined 'penetration' as a unilateral act by the accused and, therefore, in cases of consensual intercourse, the act of penetration may not solely be attributed to the accused. Various HCs have also considered the impact such prosecution has on the victim and have proceeded to quash proceedings if pursuing the case would harm the victim.Accepting the suggestions of the senior advocates, the court impleaded Centre in the case and issued notice. ""For carrying forward the suggestion of the learned amici, we propose to implead the Union of India through the ministry of women and child development, so that more effective orders can be passed,"" it said.""The secretary of the ministry shall appoint a committee of experts to deal with the suggestions of the amici curiae. Senior officers of the state shall be part of the committee. If necessary, the committee can also consult the senior counsel appointed as amici curiae. Immediately on service of notice, the secretary shall constitute a committee. The members of the committee constituted by this court (comprising Dr Pekham Basu from TISS; Jayita Saha, clinical psychologist; and Sanjeeb Rakshit, district social welfare officer, South 24 Parganas) shall be permanent invitees to the said committee,"" the bench said.Government should also consider the suggestion to have a policy on comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education because as per a Unesco report, education policies on life skills-based HIV and sexuality education was only at secondary education-level in India, the bench added.Way back in 2001, Madras HC had suggested amending the law not to penalise such relationships. ""An adolescent boy and girl who are in the grips of their hormones and biological changes and whose decision-making ability is yet to fully develop, should essentially receive the support and guidance of their parents and the society at large. These incidents should never be perceived from an adult's point of view and such an understanding will, in fact, lead to lack of empathy. An adolescent boy who is sent to prison in a case of this nature will be persecuted throughout his life. It is high time that the legislature takes into consideration cases of this nature involving adolescents involved in relationships and swiftly bring in necessary amendments under the Act. The legislature has to keep pace with changing societal needs and bring about necessary changes in law and, more particularly, in a stringent law such as Pocso Act,"" it had said.Delhi HC recently in Feb granted relief to a boy and quashed the case against him and had said that the focus of the law should be on preventing exploitation and abuse, rather than punishing love. ""Love is a fundamental human experience, and adolescents have the right to form emotional connections. The law should evolve to acknowledge and respect these relationships, as long as they are consensual and free from coercion,"" HC had said.",Supreme court orders centre to consider decriminalising consensual relationships. Justices abhay s oka and ujjal bhuyan issued notice to the centre through the ministry of women and child development to form an expert committee to examine the issue.

About Jagadguru Kripalu Parishat (JKP)



PRAYAGRAJ: In the heart of Braj, Kirti Mandir stands as a shining symbol of devotion, architectural brilliance, and humanitarian spirit. Located in Rangeeli Mahal, Barsana Dham, this spiritually resonant temple is the world’s first and only shrine depicting Shri Radha Rani in her divine childhood form, tenderly seated in the lap of her mother Kirti Maiya.Inaugurated on the auspicious day of Basant Panchmi on Feb 10 in 2019, Kirti Mandir was envisioned by Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji Maharaj and brought to completion through the tireless efforts of his daughters and Jagadguru Kripalu Parishat (JKP) presidents — Vishakha Tripathi, Shyama Tripathi and Krishna Tripathi.Built over 12 years, this 80,000-square-foot temple is a true architectural marvel, integrating elements of both Nagara and Dravidian styles without the use of cement or steel. The exterior features pink sandstone intricately carved by master artisans, while the interior is adorned with Italian Carrara marble inlaid with semi-precious stones.A distinctive spiritual element of the temple is the inclusion of 38 devotional couplets from Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji Maharaj’s compositions Radha Govind Geet and Shyama Shyam Geet, inlaid in marble, making the sacred text a part of the very structure.The sanctum sanctorum houses the unprecedented deity of baby Radha cradled in Kirti Maiya’s lap — a depiction never seen before. Flanking them are idols of Shri Sita Rama and Shri Radha Krishna, with Ashtamahasakhis, Shri Radha Rani's eight eternal companions, enshrined nearby.The temple’s design and spiritual significance echo the deep vatsalya bhava, the sacred maternal love, experienced by Kirti Maiya for Shri Radha. According to scriptural tradition, Kirti Maiya and Vrishabhanu Ji performed penance for over 4.3 million years to receive the divine blessing of being Radha Rani’s parents.The temple is also a centre of visual devotion, with walls adorned by vivid paintings of Shri Radha’s pastimes with her sakhis and Shri Krishna's divine glance filled with love. The temple’s spires are said to radiate Radha’s divine name across the cosmos, making it a beacon for spiritual seekers worldwide.Adjacent to the temple is the Jagadguru Kripalu Chikitsalaya (JKC), which offers 100% free medical services to the underprivileged. At the time of the temple’s inauguration, over 50,000 villagers were provided with essential items in a large-scale distribution drive. This tradition of selfless seva (service) continues to this day through regular health camps and support initiatives.Founded by Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji Maharaj in 1970, JKP is a spiritual, educational, and philanthropic non-profit dedicated to spreading devotion to Radha-Krishna and serving humanity through charitable schools, colleges, hospitals, temples and welfare programs.","Kirti mandir is the world’s first and only shrine depicting shri radha rani in her divine childhood form.
