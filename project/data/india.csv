NEW DELHI: Govt told the Lok Sabha on Wednesday that 13,000 more general tickets than the daily average were sold at New Delhi railway station on Feb 15, the day 18 people died because of a crowd rush. “On Feb 15, approximately 49,000 general tickets were issued from New Delhi railway station, which were 13,000 more than the daily average number of tickets sold during the previous six months,” railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said in a written reply to TMC member Mala Roy.The minister, however, stressed that “to cater to this extra” (demand), five Kumbh special trains , each with room to accommodate 3,000 passengers, were operated from NDLS. He also pointed out that “unreserved tickets issued from a particular station on a particular date may or may not be for that station and date”, in a reference to the usual practice of passengers buying tickets well ahead of the travel date.Five trains were sufficient for 15,000 extra passengers,” the minister said. Railways has since transferred the divisional and additional divisional managers of Delhi along with the station director and senior divisional commercial manager pending completion of an inquiry into the crowd rush.Roy had asked for “details of average general rail ticket sale in New Delhi railway station per day during the last six months; the number of general rail ticket sale from New Delhi railway station on Feb 15, 2025; and whether sale of tickets was abnormally high, and, if so, the reasons thereof ”.In his reply, Vaishnaw gave details of how unreserved tickets can be procured through various ticketing counters and not necessarily at the station counter. “Unreserved tickets for distance up to 199km can be procured on the same day while advance period for procuring unreserved tickets for a distance of 200 km and above is three days.Further, from a railway station, unreserved tickets can be issued for the journey originating from any of the cluster stations defined in the system, viz from New Delhi railway station, unreserved tickets can be issued for the journey originating from any of the 57 stations of Delhi area,” he said.","13,000 more general tickets than daily average were sold at new delhi railway station on feb 15, the day 18 people died because of a crowd rush.

BENGALURU: Forget Chandrayaan, Isro. If you really want to test lunar terrain, just get your mission vehicles to take a drive down Bellandur's crater-riddled roads! This was the new cry that echoed in the IT hub Wednesday.With deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar scheduled to visit Bellandur at 4pm, hundreds of residents hit the road at Devarabeesanahalli near Sakra Hospital. Waving placards that read, ‘No Need for Moon Mission, Isro — Just Drive Here!', frustrated residents chanted ""Beku beku, road beku."" That Shivakumar did not turn up only left them angry and frustrated.""This road has been in a terrible condition for the last six months,"" said Kusum Sahay , an elderly resident, adding, ""There are no pavements for pedestrians, and stepping out of a car itself is a challenge.""Venkat, another resident, fumed over the neglect of one of the city's key localities. ""We are the creme de la creme of Bengaluru, yet infrastructure here is cringe-worthy. This is a major road connecting Koramangala and Indiranagar — how hard is it to fix it quickly?""A resident of Mantri Espana highlighted the daily struggle. ""We moved here two years ago hoping things would improve, but nothing has changed. Just yesterday (Tuesday), I took my father to an eye hospital — a seven-minute drive took 20 minutes because of these crater-sized potholes. For elderly people, walking to Sakra Hospital is impossible. We are forced to take cars even for short distances, and that just adds to the traffic chaos.""Kanchana Ganeshan, another protester, recalled how she used to cycle on the lake road four years ago. ""Now, I wouldn't dare. What used to be a smooth ride turned into a bone-rattling nightmare. Every day, travelling just seven kilometres is an ordeal.""Rajesh Narka, representing Bellandur Rising 2025 initiative, called for swift action. ""Bellandur is home to some of the biggest IT hubs, yet the roads are in a shambles. We take pride in our city, but we cannot be expected to tolerate this mess. If the govt really wanted to fix this, it wouldn't have taken long.""Joginder Yadav, a resident, pointed to the irony of last-minute patchwork before the DCM's scheduled visit. ""BBMP suddenly laid gravel and sprinkled water just because a minister was expected. Illegal parking, footpath encroachments and lack of traffic lights make things worse. We pay our taxes — we contribute to nation-building. Even though many of us are migrants, the govt should remember ‘Atithi Devo Bhava' and give us basic infrastructure in return,"" he said.","Hundreds of residents hit the road at devarabeesanahalli near sakra hospital.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu government, led by MK Stalin , on Thursday replaced the Rupee symbol ""₹"" with the Tamil script ""ரூ"" in the logo for the state's 2025-26 budget. This move comes amid the ongoing language debate, with the BJP-led central government and the DMK-led Tamil Nadu government once again at odds over the NEP's three-language policy .Tamil Nadu finance minister Thangam Thennarasu is set to present the 2025-26 budget on Friday.The budget logo features ""ரூ"" (ru), the first letter of the Tamil word ""Rubaai,"" which represents the Indian currency in the Tamil language.It also includes the caption ""Everything for All,"" reflecting the ruling DMK’s emphasis on an inclusive model of governance.This move has further fuelled the language debate, with Tamil Nadu repeatedly accusing the Centre of trying to ""impose Hindi"" on southern states.Earlier, Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin strongly criticised the central government, arguing that the push for Hindi threatens the diversity of regional languages in North India.He said, ""More than 25 native languages in North India have disappeared due to the dominance of Hindi and Sanskrit.

NEW DELHI: The Karnataka government on Wednesday rescinded its directive for the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to probe potential lapses and dereliction of duty by police officers at Kempegowda International Airport in connection with actress Ranya Rao’s gold smuggling case .The CID investigation was initially ordered on Monday night but was later withdrawn, news agency PTI reported. According to a revised order, additional chief secretary Gaurav Gupta is already conducting an inquiry into the possible involvement of Ranya’s stepfather, K Ramachandra Rao , a senior police officer of DGP rank.Ramachandra Rao, who currently serves as the Managing Director of the Karnataka State Police Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation, is under scrutiny for the alleged misuse of protocol-related facilities. Gupta’s inquiry aims to establish the facts surrounding his role in the case.The case gained prominence after authorities seized gold bars worth ₹12.56 crore from Ranya at Kempegowda International Airport. Subsequent searches at her residence led to the recovery of gold jewelry worth ₹2.06 crore and ₹2.67 crore in cash, officials said.Earlier in the day, a Bengaluru Special Court for Economic Offences reserved its verdict on the bail plea of Ranya Rao. The court is expected to announce its decision on March 14.During the bail hearing, senior advocate Kiran Javali, representing Rao, argued that the DRI failed to follow proper legal procedures during her arrest and interrogation. He contended that the arrest memo did not explicitly mention the ""grounds of arrest,"" violating the Supreme Court’s guidelines established in the DK Basu case.Javali further stated that such procedural lapses warrant bail, irrespective of the seriousness of the allegations.Countering the arguments, the DRI’s legal team emphasised the seriousness of the charges, alleging that Rao was involved in a major gold smuggling operation. They argued that releasing her on bail could hinder the investigation and potentially lead to evidence tampering or witness intimidation.Meanwhile, Rao has alleged mistreatment in custody, claiming that DRI officials verbally abused her when she hesitated to answer certain questions. She also accused them of coercing her into signing documents without proper consent.The DRI has strongly denied these allegations, maintaining that all procedures were conducted lawfully and respectfully.As the case unfolds, Rao’s husband, Jatin Hukkeri, has sought interim relief from the Karnataka high court, anticipating possible arrest. The court has granted him temporary protection from arrest, providing a brief reprieve as the investigation continues.",The karnataka government rescinded its directive for the criminal investigation department (cid) to probe potential lapses and dereliction of duty by police officers.

With the body of a youth killed in Manipur’s Kuki-dominated Kangpokpi on March 8 finally handed over to his family, authorities there said Wednesday they expect protests and blockade in the district to end soon.However, the road to lasting peace in the restive state may be a long way off. Ongoing talks between the Kuki-Zo community and Centre’s interlocutor A K Mishra are unlikely to make much headway with the former sticking to its demand for a “separate hill state” after hiving off Meitei-dominated Valley areas.The demand, which goes against the Constitutional framework, will not be acceptable to the Centre.Govt also does not seem keen to concede to the Kuki demand for a separate administrative framework for the tribal-dominated hilly regions either, recognising that it can fuel the demand for a separate state, besides giving fillip to separatist tendencies in the strategically crucial border state.Still, efforts would be to stay engaged with both Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities, while tactfully persuading the latter to settle for a solution within the four corners of the Constitution, including granting them more autonomy and preserving their unique culture, heritage and language.Sources said the district magistrate and superintendent of police of Kangpokpi had been engaging with Kuki-Zo protestors over the past few days to persuade them to accept the body of the local killed during protests on March 8, amid clashes between them and security forces.The killing had triggered further tension with Kuki-Zo protestors ordering a shutdown, apart from blocking roads and stopping the movement of vehicles. “The blockade call was given for all areas with a significant Kuki-Zo population. But its effect was seen largely in Kangpokpi. However, the talks between the local administration and community representatives have made headway, with the family of the deceased protester taking back his body for last rites,” said a Manipur govt functionary.A senior Manipur police functionary shared that a total 4,500 weapons, including those looted after ethnic violence broke out in Manipur in May 2023, were now back with police. Of these, around 1,050 were surrendered by rebels in response to a call given by Governor Ajay Bhalla.“The remaining weapons were recovered in raids and searches undertaken over time by police and security forces. These raids shall continue, now that the deadline set by the governor to voluntarily surrender weapons has ended,” said the functionary.Manipur MP Bimol Akoijam protested in Lok Sabha that his question about the state was removed from the list of questions after having been listed initially. He raised the issue in Lok Sabha during the zero hour. Jagdambika Pal, who was in the chair, denied permission to raise the issue. “This issue cannot be raised here,” he said. Akoijam has been raising issues related to the state which is affected by ethnic strife for around two years. His office, however, refused to answer what the issue was about.","The body of a youth killed in manipur’s kuki-dominated kangpokpi on march 8 finally handed over to his family.

Stay updated to make your trip smooth and problem-free.As per the CBIC guidelines, Indian passengers returning from Dubai after a stay of more than six months can bring up to 1 kg of gold with them. However, as per Economic Times report, this is allowed only if they pay the applicable customs duty. The gold can be in the form of jewelry, coins, or bars. It is important for travelers to carry proper documentation, such as purchase invoices, that provide details on the price, purity, and date of purchase.

NEW DELHI: The post-mortem reports of three youths from J&K’s Kathua, who were found dead three days after they went missing, have not revealed any gunshot wound or physical assault, ruling out a “terrorist attack” angle.The trauma injuries , including to their heads, point to their death by “accidental fall from a height,” said sources.Sharing this, sources in the J&K govt also told TOI that two more minors, who went missing from the same district — they were reported by their family as missing only a couple of days ago though they have been gone since Feb 28 — had an argument with their family and possibly left home to work elsewhere on daily wages.This, the sources said, has happened before with the cousins, aged 12 and 15 and both herders, staying away from their family home for days to do daily-wage jobs. The police are making enquiries with their relatives and past employers to trace them.As per the post-mortem reports of the three Kathua residents — identified as Darshan Singh, 40, Yogesh Singh, 32, and Varun Singh, 15 — whose bodies were discovered on March 8 in a gorge next to a waterfall, the cause of their death was trauma and head injury, purportedly caused by their accidentally slipping in the dark, down a rocky gorge. A backpack carried by one of them got stuck on a branch as they fell. A mobile used by them was also recovered from the spot. A liquor bottle with half of its contents consumed was found, pointing to possible inebriated state of the two adults.“Their viscera reports are now awaited for further insight into the cause and circumstances of the deaths,” said a source.Interviews with the family members of the three deceased persons, who were on their way to a wedding in Lohai Malhar, revealed that they were in touch with them over phone till the evening of March 5 and had even communicated that they had lost their way while moving with wedding party. However, a couple of hours later their phones were found to be switched off.","Post-mortem reports of three youths from j&k’s kathua, who were found dead three days after they went missing, have not revealed any gunshot wound or physical assault.

NEW DELHI: A parliamentary panel has flagged that the housing and urban affairs ministry may not be able to spend over Rs 50,000 crore of the Centre’s allocation for the second phase of its urban rejuvenation scheme , AMRUT, even after the tenure ends in March 2026. It has also highlighted how the ministry is unable to utilise funds for the National Urban Digital Mission (NUDM) as the cabinet has not yet approved it, despite it being announced in the last budget.The panel, in its report on the ‘Demand for Grants for 2025-26’ tabled in both Houses of Parliament on Wednesday, stated that the public bus transport scheme, which was announced in the 2021-22 Budget, was approved by govt only in Aug 2023 as the PM-eBus Sewa Scheme . The funds under this scheme were, “for the first time, actually spent during the financial year 2024-25”.Similarly, the NUDM, which was announced as a new scheme in the July 2024 Budget with an allocation of Rs 1,150 crore for FY 2024-25, has yet to receive cabinet approval. “The funds allocated thus remained unutilised,” it said.On fund utilisation under the AMRUT 2.0 mission, which was launched in Oct 2021 with the target to make cities ‘water secure’ and provide functional water tap connections to all households in all of about 4,852 urban local bodies and universal coverage of sewerage and septage management in 500 AMRUT cities, the panel observed that the size of the scheme was Rs 2.8 lakh crore, including the central share of Rs 76,760 crore for five years (2021-22 to 2025-26). However, only Rs 13,172 crore central assistance has been disbursed so far since the inception of the scheme and the total outlay for 2025-26 is Rs 10,000 crore.“Accordingly, post proposed budgetary allocation of Rs 10,000 crore, the remaining amount of the central share for the mission will be Rs 52,651 crore. The committee has observed that even after the utilisation of the proposed budgetary allocation of Rs 10,000 crore in the FY 2025-26, the mission which is ending in 2026 still has to spend 68% of its centre share of Rs 76,760 crore,” it added.In its report, the panel on PM-eBus Sewa Scheme, which targets to deploy 10,000 electric buses, mentioned that the ministry has informed that the total demand of buses so far tendered for aggregation stands 6,518 from 13 states and four UTs. Flagging concerns, it said the eligibility of buses per city based on the 2011 census may not provide the correct parameter for their allocation.It added that the central assistance (CA) of Rs 24, Rs 22 and Rs 20 per km proposed to be provided for 12, 9 and 7 metre buses is less and may result in increased financial burden on municipal corporations. Similarly, the condition of fixed assured kms of 160, 180 and 200 for 7, 9 and 12 metre respectively needs to be revisited as many municipal buses operate only for 150-160 kms daily.","The housing and urban affairs ministry may not be able to spend over rs 50,000 crore of the centre’s allocation for the second phase of its urban rejuvenation scheme.
