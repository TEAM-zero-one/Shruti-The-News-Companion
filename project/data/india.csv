"Amid talk of Thackerays reunion, MNS 2nd rung recalls hostilities",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-talk-of-thackerays-reunion-mns-2nd-rung-recalls-hostilities/articleshow/120467966.cms,"MUMBAI: A day after estranged cousins Raj and Uddhav Thackeray hinted at a possible patch-up between their parties, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena and Shiv Sena (UBT), there were already rumblings from party workers.Speaking to the media Sunday, MNS’ functionary Sandeep Deshpande asked whether Uddhav would apologise for the 17,000 cases lodged against MNS workers when he was CM and pointed out that he had rejected an olive branch from MNS in 2017. “The parties should not come together just for elections but there are larger issues affecting Marathi people ,” he added.In response, Sena (UBT) spokesperson Sanjay Raut pointed out that Deshpande was a party functionary and the words of Raj Thackeray would prevail. “Raj Thackeray made a statement and Uddhav Thackeray welcomed it. What someone else says is not relevant. Everything is for the good of Maharashtra but those who are anti-Maharashtra should not be entertained. We have not given pre- conditions. Raj Thackerary knows who is anti-Maharashtra.”Raj’s frequent overtures to BJP are likely to remain a sticking point with Uddhav’s party which had a bitter parting from its former ally. “Both Raj and Uddhav spoke about the good of Maharashtra. BJP does not fit into this formula. Nor do those who support it. This is not a pre-condition but the sentiment among people,” Raut added.Naresh Mhaske from Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena, meanwhile, dismissed the possibility of a patch-up and said, “When Raj was in the party, Uddhav did not want to give him responsibility and did not want him to visit shakhas. How is he going to include him now?”Industries minister Uday Samant from Shiv Sena also dismissed the possibility of a reconciliation. “Raj is an independent thinker and he is unlikely to respond to riders and pre-conditions,” he said.","Mns’ functionary sandeep deshpande asked whether uddhav would apologise for the 17,000 cases lodged against mns workers when he was cm.

NEW DELHI: In an incident reminiscent of the Atul Subhash case , a 33-year-old techie from Uttar Pradesh, Mohit Yadav , has died by suicide, allegedly due to mental harassment by his wife. In a video message recorded before his death, Yadav cited the lack of legal protection for men as a key reason behind his decision.""By the time you get this video, I will be gone from this world. If there was a law for men, maybe I wouldn’t have taken this step. I couldn’t bear the mental torture by my wife and her family. Mom, Dad, please forgive me,"" Yadav said in the video. ""If I don’t get justice even after my death, then let my ashes be immersed in a drain,"" he added.He claimed that his wife Priya Yadav threatened him to register his house and property in her name and accused his mother-in-law of making his wife abort their child. The TOI could not independently verify the authenticity of the video.""My wife threatened me that if I didn't register my house and property in her name, she would implicate my family in a dowry case. Her father, Manoj Yadav, filed a false complaint, and her brother threatened to kill me,"" he said.This comes only two days after a 30-year-old woman in UP was booked for allegedly driving her husband, Mohit Tyagi, a 34-year-old media professional, to suicide through constant harassment and financial demands. According to the FIR filed by Mohit's brother, the trouble began soon after Mohit married Priyanka from Sambhal in December 2020. She allegedly took off with gifted jewellery and lodged false complaints against him and his family.Last year in December, Atul Subhash, a 34-year-old Bengaluru techie, died by suicide in his apartment. Before his death, he left behind a 24-page note and a video message, in which he accused his wife and in-laws of relentless harassment. He alleged they had filed eight false police complaints against him and demanded Rs 3 crore to settle a divorce, along with an additional Rs 30 lakh for access to his son. Following a complaint lodged by Atul’s younger brother, Bikas Modi, the three accused were arrested.Also read: Meerut murder Déjà Vu: Woman, lover kill hubby in UP","Mohit yadav, a 33-year-old techie from uttar pradesh, has died by suicide.

It’s not just about my desire or selfishness. We need to look at the bigger picture.

If people settle their differences, it’s a good thing. What else can I say about it? I also appeal to all Marathi people to come together for the benefit of Maharashtra and Marathi,” Fadnavis said.Echoing a similar sentiment, Maharashtra BJP president Chandrashekhar Bawankule said it was entirely up to Raj Thackeray whether or not to align with Uddhav Thackeray.“It is Raj Thackeray's prerogative whether to join hands with Uddhav Thackeray or not. He can decide his party's future. The BJP has no objection to it,” Bawankule said.Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde, on the other hand, appeared irked when asked about the possible alliance between the Thackeray brothers.Shinde seemed visibly irritated and brushed off the reporter’s mic. He asked the reporter to focus on the government's work instead.“Talk about work,” Shinde said.State Congress chief Harshwardhan Sapkal said if the two Thackeray families came together, there was no reason to object.""When Raj Thackeray says his issues with Uddhav Thackeray are not bigger than Maharashtra, he must be hinting that BJP is causing harm to Maharashtra.. that investment is going out of Maharashtra,"" he said in Pune. Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT) are allies at present.""The BJP is trying to undermine the language and culture of Maharashtra, and Raj Thackeray's stand seems to endorse this view,"" he added.However, Shiv Sena MP Naresh Mhaske expressed skepticism over the possibility of reconciliation, pointing to past tensions between the two.“Uddhav Thackeray had threatened to leave the house if Raj Thackeray was given any responsibility. He even opposed Raj’s visits to party branches in Mumbai and differentiated between his supporters. Uddhav should answer why he opposed Raj Thackeray,” Mhaske said.Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam took a jibe at the potential alliance, dismissing it as electorally irrelevant. “Two zeros always make a zero,” he said.“Uddhav aligned with Congress and relied on Muslim votes. Now, realising that this strategy hasn’t worked, he is leaning toward Raj Thackeray. This is not about Maharashtra’s interest—it’s about personal survival. Even together, they cannot pose a challenge to Mahayuti,” Nirupam added.Meanwhile, NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) MP Supriya Sule said the move should be welcomed if it is in the interest of the state.“Raj Thackeray said that the state’s issues are bigger than their personal dispute. That is happy news to me.

Here are the key points:



Rescue operations were still under way when last reports came in, with police and emergency teams battling rough weather to reach affected villagers.

Over 100 people were safely rescued from flood-hit Dharam Kund village, where nearly 40 houses were damaged -- 10 of them completely washed away.

The downpour led to multiple landslides and mudslides between Nashri and Banihal on the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway (NH-44), forcing its closure.

Hundreds of vehicles were stranded as stretches of the highway were rendered impassable, including a portion near Panthiyal that was swept away. Officials advised commuters to avoid travel until the road is cleared and weather improves.

The latest casualties bring the rain-related death toll in the Jammu region to five in the last 48 hours. On Saturday, two people, including a woman, were killed and another injured by lightning strikes in Reasi’s Arnas area.

A senior government official confirmed ""massive damage"" in the district due to landslides, hailstorms, and strong winds, saying the immediate priority was to protect lives. An official meeting was scheduled for later in the day to assess the situation and plan aid.

Union minister and Udhampur MP Jitendra Singh, who has been closely monitoring the developments, praised the swift response of the Ramban district administration led by Deputy Commissioner Baseer-ul-Haq Chaudhary.

Singh, in a post on X, highlighted the challenging weather conditions and said relief efforts, including financial support, were being extended. He added that his personal resources were also available for those in need and urged the public to remain calm.

“The district administration deserves appreciation for timely and prompt action, which helped save several precious lives,” he said.

Authorities continue to assess damage and provide relief, while NH-44 remains shut, cutting off the Kashmir Valley’s only all-weather road link with the rest of the country.

NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav stirred the pot with a claim about the Maha Kumbh of this year, suggesting that it was part of a BJP plot to present Yogi Adityanath as the Prime Ministerial candidate.Addressing the media in Prayagraj, SP supremo said, ""It is being heard that during the Maha Kumbh, it was their plan to announce his (CM Yogi Adityanath) name as the Prime Minister's face. They wanted to make this a political Kumbh. This was not a religious Kumbh.""Yadav didn’t stop there. He targeted the saffron party, accusing it of fostering division in society. ""The truth is that if anyone is creating rifts between religions, then it is the BJP. Creating a divide in society in the name of religion, caste is a very well-planned programme of the BJP, and they spend funds on it. Whatever was said is the thinking of the BJP,"" he said.His comments came on the heels of the heated political row surrounding BJP MP Nishikant Dubey's remarks about the Supreme Court.Dubey had alleged that the apex court was ""inciting religious wars"" and questioned its authority, suggesting that Parliament should shut down if the judiciary was to make laws.""The top court has only one aim: 'Show me the face, and I will show you the law'. The Supreme Court is going beyond its limits. If one has to go to the Supreme Court for everything, then Parliament and the State Assembly should be shut,"" Dubey said.The BJP, meanwhile, distanced itself from Dubey’s statements, with party leaders asserting that these remarks were personal and not aligned with the party's position.",Samajwadi party chief akhilesh yadav claims bjp wanted to present yogi adityanath as prime ministerial candidate.

His comments came as families who had fled from Dhuliyan to a relief camp in Malda due to widespread violence in the district were brought back to their homes under tight security arrangements.""These people were not brought back, they have willingly returned... The houses in their area were not vandalised, they just fled out of fear. And now they are returning home... Our city is returning to normalcy. It has been seven days and the situation is peaceful... Our brotherhood will prevail,"" he said.This statement comes amid ongoing tensions following the violence in Murshidabad, which led to hundreds of families fleeing their homes. Islam's comments were echoed by TMC MP Khalilur Rahaman, who expressed relief over the return of those displaced by the violence. Rahaman said, ""It is a good thing that our friends who migrated from Dhuliyan are now coming back home out of their own will. The atmosphere in Dhuliyan is very peaceful. This is what everyone wants and it will continue like this.""The violence, which broke out in multiple areas of Murshidabad, prompted many families to flee to relief camps in neighbouring Malda. These families were reportedly brought back under heavy security, with the local government working to restore normalcy. However, the National Commission for Women (NCW) has raised concerns over the treatment of women and children during the unrest.The unrest was linked to protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act, with several villages in Murshidabad seeing significant damage. Despite the ongoing political tensions, Islam remains optimistic that the region will recover, and the return of displaced families marks a positive step toward restoring stability in the area.Vijaya Rahatkar, chairperson of the NCW, called on the West Bengal government to act urgently to address the suffering of the riot-affected people, particularly women. During a visit to the relief camps, Rahatkar described the distressing conditions faced by the displaced individuals, stating, ""The torture and suffering they faced was beyond imagination, having left a deep scar in their minds which need to be healed and addressed on an urgent basis with a humanitarian approach.""Rahatkar further criticised the state government for its lack of response, saying it was their ""moral duty"" to provide security and compensation for the victims. She emphasised the need for confidence-building measures and highlighted the calls from the affected women for greater security, including the establishment of a Border Security Force (BSF) camp in the area.","Amirul islam, tmc mla from samsherganj, denies reports of vandalism in murshidabad.
