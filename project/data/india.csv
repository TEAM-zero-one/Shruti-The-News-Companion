Mamata Banerjee Slams BJP as Over 300 Bengal Workers Jailed in Rajasthan for Speaking Bengali

NEW DELHI: Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran met West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on Wednesday, signalling a possible reset in ties between the industrial group and the state.The meeting, the first between Mamata Banerjee and a Tata group chairman since Banerjee became chief minister, comes over 17 years after her agitation led to Tata motors pulling out its Nano project from Singur.In a post on X, the TMC said, ""Mamata Banerjje hosted Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Sons and the Tata Group, for a constructive dialogue on Bengal's industrial growth and emerging opportunities. The meeting reflected Bengal's commitment to fostering meaningful public-private partnerships that drive innovation, investment, and inclusive development.""Seventeen years ago, following a protest led by Banerjee against land acquisition for a Tata Motors facility in Singur, the company relocated the plant. At the time, the state was governed by CPM under the late Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.The opposition Trinamool Congress in West Bengal, led by Mamata Banerjee, had led widespread protests after the state government had rejected her demand to return 400 acres land to farmers.In a move that was termed ""sad"" by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Tata announced his exit plan. PM Modi, who was then chief minister of Gujarat, spotted an opportunity and slid into the industrialist's DMs with a 'welcome' text.""When Ratan Tata said in a press conference in Kolkata that they are leaving West Bengal, I sent him a short SMS saying 'welcome'. And now you can see what a Re 1 (worth) SMS can do,"" Modi had said.Production of Nano cars was discontinued in 2018.At the Bengal global business summit (BGBS), held in February this year, Banerjee had said in her speech that the Tata group chairman could not make it to the summit owing to certain exigencies.Banerjee had a detailed discussion with him on the eve of the summit. ""He has assured (me) that they want to invest more and more in Bengal. And he will come to Bengal very soon and discuss (things) in detail,"" she had said then.","Tata group chairman n chandrasekaran met west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee in kolkata on wednesday.

All shots fired from behind, reveals autopsy

GURGAON: The investigation into the murder of a 25-year-old former international tennis player, allegedly by her father, has revealed a sudden deterioration in their relationship. The apparent reason was a disagreement over the academy she ran near their house, but the roots clearly run deeper. The father, who claims to have spent Rs 2 crore on his daughter's tennis career, told interrogators he was troubled by questions about her ""character"" that some of his associates had raised.Deepak Yadav, who shot Radhika at their house Thursday morning, had allegedly been insisting for two weeks on her closing the academy, even offering to compensate her for financial losses. She refused. Three days before the shooting, there was another bust-up during which he threatened to shoot himself or her if she did not do as he said, police said. She refused again.What has become increasingly clear is the chasm - between the father who claims to have spent Rs 2 crore on grooming his daughter as a tennis player, even accompanying her for training and tournaments, and the father so poisoned by ""taunts"" he claims to have faced because of Radhika's academy, his own ego and insecurities, and suspicions about her that grew in his mind that he would turn the gun on the same daughter.Vinod Kumar, SHO of Sector 56 police station and IO in the case, said Deepak (49) appeared to be eccentric and temperamental. ""He has psychological issues. He claims to have been subjected to taunts from associates in Wazirabad village near his house for allowing his daughter to run an academy and using her money. He tends to nurse grudges. He would believe anyone and fight with family members. There was no other motive for her murder but his desire to discontinue the academy,"" Kumar said.Sources said Deepak visited relatives at Kasan in Manesar 15 days ago. On his return, his spat with Radhika blew up. A source said Radhika's mother Manju, who is indisposed, had told police Deepak doubted everyone. ""She told us that after they got married, he had objected to her interactions with a close male relative, after which she did not speak to him for a long time. However, Deepak supported Radhika's dream of playing tennis wholeheartedly,"" the source said. The supportive father that those close to the family and Radhika's tennis circle knew Deepak as was also by her side when Radhika acted in a music video, which was released last year. During the shoot in 2023, both Deepak and Manju were present at the location, police sources said, ruling out any connection between the video and the murder. Police will, however, seek access to her deleted Instagram account for further leads into the probe. Radhika is believed to have deleted the account around a month ago.Raj Kumar, a maternal cousin of Deepak, expressed disbelief about the shooting and its apparent trigger - differences over Radhika's academy. ""He had supported her career for years and invested a lot in it,"" said Raj Kumar. The autopsy report revealed Radhika was shot not three but four times by Deepak. According to the report, all the shots were fired from behind, striking her upper torso, specifically the chest area. ""Entry wounds indicated deep penetration, causing extensive internal damage. Bullets passed through her lungs and pierced her heart, leading to rapid and massive internal bleeding. Medical examiners concluded she died within minutes of being shot due to catastrophic and irreversible damage to vital organs,"" the report said.In his statement, Deepak claimed to have shot Radhika three times. A source involved in the probe said it indicated the killer's state of mind and likely a rage so intense he was not even sure how many shots he had fired at her. According to the FIR, Deepak told police Radhika had won several trophies in her tennis career but had recently suffered a shoulder injury, preventing her from playing and leading her to start the academy.""When I visited Wazirabad village to buy milk, people taunted me for enjoying my daughter's earnings and questioned her character. I asked my daughter to shut her academy, but she refused. I felt hurt and insulted and kept thinking about it for days.In fury, I took out my revolver and shot her three times in the back while she was preparing food, killing her,"" the FIR, quoting Deepak, says. It adds that while Deepak's son Dheeraj was at work, Manju was resting in a room at the time of the shooting. Deepak's brother Kuldeep, who lives on the ground floor of House No. G-156, Sushant Lok-II, Sector 57, along with his wife, son and daughter, was the one who filed the police complaint.","Tennis player radhika yadav, 25, was shot dead by her father on thursday.

Judge seeks 'reasonable care' while invoking BNS' stringent Sec 152

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad high court has observed that merely expressing support for Pakistan without referencing any specific incident or mentioning India does not prima facie constitute an offence under Section 152 (act endangering sovereignty or unity and integrity of India) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).Allowing the bail plea of Riyaz, accused of pledging support to Pakistan in an Instagram post, Justice Arun Kumar Singh Deshwal said a perusal of record showed ""the applicant has not mentioned anything which shows disrespect towards our country"".""Merely posting a message to...show support for any country may create anger or disharmony among citizens of India"", and may be punishable under Sec 196 of BNS (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc), but ""definitively will not attract"" Sec 152, the HC said in its July 10 order.Sec 196 of BNS provides for up to seven years in jail, while an offence under Sec 152 is non-bailable and carries a life sentence or imprisonment up to seven years and fine. The judge called for exercising ""reasonable care"" while invoking Sec 152 of BNS, saying it was a new provision stipulating stringent punishment, which had no equivalence in IPC.""For attracting ingredients of Sec 152, there must be purpose by spoken or written words, signs, visible representations, electronic communication to promote secession, armed rebellion, subversive activities or encourages feeling of separating activities or endangers the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India,"" HC said.""Merely posting a message to show support for any country may create anger or disharmony among citizens of India"", and may be punishable under Sec 196 of BNS (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc), which provides for up to seven years jail, but ""definitively will not attract ingredients of Sec 152, BNS"", HC said in its order July 10.Justice Deshwal said spoken words or posts on social media are also covered under the right to freedom of speech and expression, and should not be narrowly interpreted, unless they are of such nature which threaten the country's sovereignty and integrity or encourages separatism.During the hearing, the applicant submitted through his counsel that his social media post did not lower the dignity and sovereignty of the country. Neither was India named, nor the Indian flag or any photo was posted which showed disrespect to the country, he argued. ""Merely supporting a country, even if that country is an enemy to India, does not attract the ingredients of BNS Sec 152,"" the applicant's counsel said.State opposed the bail plea, submitting that such posts encourages separatism. HC, granting bail, directed applicant not to post any material on social media which could create disharmony among people.","Allahabad high court observed that merely expressing support for pakistan does not prima facie constitute an offence.

The police later reached her home and discovered that she was a tennis player and ran a tennis academy,” Kumar said.According to police, Deepak was upset that his daughter continued to run the academy despite his repeated objections.He allegedly believed there was no financial need for her to work, given the family’s considerable income from rental properties. “He said he was financially well off so his daughter need not run the academy,” Kumar added. “They had frequent arguments about this.”Police have ruled out other motives, including speculation related to a music video Radhika had featured in. “This is just a rumour… He has accepted to have committed the entire incident and the reason he has given behind the murder is that he was angry about the running of the academy and due to this anger he committed this crime,” Kumar said.The weapon used, a licensed pistol owned by the accused since 2004, has been seized. Deepak Yadav was arrested from the scene and produced in court on Friday. The court sent him to police custody for a day. Officers are now working to recover the remaining ammunition, with a search planned on his property in Kasam village near Rewari.Police confirmed that Radhika’s mother, Manju Yadav, was present on the first floor of the house at the time of the shooting. Investigators have termed the case as being in its early stages but say all evidence so far points to the academy dispute as the sole motive.","National-level tennis player radhika yadav, 25, was found dead in a private hospital after being brought in with bullet injuries.

Tharoor's praise, fuel for BJP

NEW DELHI: The conspicuous tension between Shashi Tharoor and the Congress party has become more pronounced as the Kerala unit leaders launched a scathing attack on the Thiruvananthapuram MP after he pitched himself as the CM face for the state polls due next year.Ambitious Tharoor, who had earlier thrown his hat into the Congress presidential race, a move that reportedly left a sour taste for the Gandhis, once again stirred the pot on Wednesday by sharing a survey that found 28.3 per cent of respondents saw him as the most suitable leader for the state.The post by Thaoor triggered a reaction from the Kerala Congress unit, with senior party leader K Muraleedharan taking a swipe at Thaoor, saying ""he should first decide which party he belongs to"".""Even if someone else is leading in the survey, if the UDF comes to power in the 2026 Assembly polls, the chief minister will be from the UDF,"" Muraleedharan told reporters on Thursday, reacting to a query on Tharoor's post on 'X'.""Our aim is to win the elections. We are not interested in such unnecessary controversies,"" he said.Amid growing rumblings within the Congress, senior leader Muraleedharan sought to downplay talk of Shashi Tharoor emerging as the party’s chief ministerial face in Kerala.""There are several senior leaders in the Kerala unit of Congress who would be in consideration for the post of CM, irrespective of what any survey says,"" he said.Muraleedharan added that the party follows a defined internal process: ""The party has a framework of rules according to which a decision would be taken as to who would be the next CM.""Another Kerala leader, Ramesh Chennithala, said it was not correct for the Congress Working Committee (CWC) member to praise PM Modi.""One thing is very clear, a Member of Parliament and a member of the CWC cannot praise the Prime Minister. It is not correct. It is painful for all the Congress workers and leaders in Kerala and throughout the country... It is a very serious issue,"" Chennithala told news agency ANI.The rift between Tharoor and the Congress high command appears to have deepened, particularly after his reaction to the recent terror attack in Pahalgam. His remarks drew sharp internal criticism, with some in the party accusing him of putting the Congress on the defensive at a sensitive time.Kerala is set to go to polls in April next year, as the five-year term of the second LDF government, led by Communist Party of India (Marxist) veteran Pinarayi Vijayan , comes to an end.",Kerala unit leaders launch scathing attack on the thiruvananthapuram mp.

NEW DELHI: Fresh off slapping a canteen worker over “stale food,” Shiv Sena MLA Sanjay Gaikwad on Friday upped the ante by publicly threatening AIMIM leader Imtiaz Jaleel.“I will beat Imtiaz Jaleel so badly that he will not be in a position to run a hotel,” Gaikwad told news agency PTI, reacting to Jaleel’s criticism of the assault.The original incident began when Gaikwad, a two-time MLA from Buldhana, ordered dinner on Tuesday night and claimed the dal and rice were stale and foul-smelling. Enraged, he stormed into the canteen, forced a worker to smell the food, and slapped and punched him. A video of the assault soon went viral, prompting condemnation from across the political spectrum and sparking a debate on legislators' conduct.Also read: Case registered against Shiv Sena MLA for slapping canteen worker; 2 days after viral video Jaleel, a former MP and the Maharashtra state president of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, condemned Gaikwad’s actions. “Beating a poor person in such a way is not right,” he said.Responding to Gaikwad's threat, Jaleel said, “Gaikwad has a history of fighting. If he is threatening me, then let me know the time and place. He doesn’t need to make an effort, I will reach that place… I have nothing to do with Sanjay Gaikwad, but if you are doing wrong… then I will stand with the poor person.”Jaleel also remarked that Gaikwad should have written a letter to the Speaker instead of resorting to violence.“Had Gaikwad been a bit educated, he would have written a letter to the Speaker. If the Speaker takes him seriously, he would have acted,” he added.On Friday, police registered a non-cognisable offence against Gaikwad and one of his supporters under sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita relating to voluntarily causing hurt and common intention. As the offence is minor, police cannot arrest the accused without court permission.Despite backlash, Gaikwad remained unapologetic. “I punched him twice. If needed, I will do it again,” he said, justifying his actions by accusing the canteen of “playing with people’s lives.” Following the incident, the Maharashtra FDA suspended the canteen’s licence, citing food safety violations.","Shiv sena mla sanjay gaikwad threatened aimim leader imtiaz jaleel on friday.

Supreme Court Asks EC to Consider Aadhaar, Ration, Voter ID for Bihar Voter Roll Revision

NEW DELHI: While Aadhaar was conceived as an identity proof, and not as proof of citizenship, allowing onboarding without real scrutiny, recent moves have meant that only verified adults can enrol for the unique ID. Besides, the Unique Identification Authority of India UIDAI ) is going to tap the online database for passport, ration cards, and birth and matriculation certificates in the future for enrolment of adults and also for updates to ensure that Aadhaar remains foolproof.While Section 9 of the Aadhaar Act states that it is not evidence of citizenship or domicile, the new tools are seeking to ensure only citizens get the unique number.Over the last 15 years, over 140 crore Aadhaars have been generated, including for those who have died, and there is near adult saturation. With infants also now getting Aadhaar soon after birth, govt has decided to tighten the norms for new adult registrations.To thwart attempts by illegal immigrants to get the unique ID based on forged or fake documents, for the last couple of years, the onus has been on states to verify credentials and that Aadhaar is only issued after rigorous checks through a state portal.In the past, there were concerns over illegal immigrants getting Aadhaar and then using it for other purposes, including other IDs.""It is going to be difficult for any illegal immigrant to now get Aadhaar,"" argued an official, indicating a shift from the relaxed, if existent at all, rules of enrolment.Sources said that even if illegal immigrants use Aadhaar to clear the SIR of electoral rolls, there is little possibility of new ones being able to use that as the launchpad for acquiring documents, and most crucially, citizenship.A new tool developed by UIDAI is also going to put a second layer of check for updates as well as enrolments by tapping into documents available online, such as driving licenses, PAN, MNREGS details, and going forward, things like electricity bill. These documents are also in line with the prescriptions for centralized KYC, and ensure a homogenous identity.","New tools are seeking to ensure only citizens get the unique number.

He was impressed with the idea and implemented it in Ramavilasam Vocational Higher Secondary School (RVGHSS) at Valakom, where he is part of the school management,"" said debutant director Vinesh Viswanath.At least eight schools in the state, and one in Punjab, have since altered seating inside classrooms to improve the optics of teacher-student interaction. ""We never expected this kind of social impact.

The protagonist, during a science fair, proposes semi-circular seating to bridge the student divide.In the movie's finale, his idea is adopted by the school, marking a shift in teaching patterns.""In a typical classroom, students at the back often feel left out, and teachers unintentionally focus more on those in the front rows. With a semi-circular layout, every student is now part of the core,"" said Sunil P Sekhar, principal of RVGHSS. ""We have noticed more participation, improved teacher-student interaction, and a sense of equality among students.""Amruth G Kumar, professor at Central University of Kerala's School of Education, said classroom seating used to be ""U-shaped"" until education spread. ""Schools shifted to a row-like system when the number of enrolments increased in the 19th century,"" he said.Teachers in schools that have shifted to semi-circular seating acknowledge that the change has resulted in students showing improved focus and better posture, making learning easier, clutter-free and more engaging.","Idea inspired by malayalam movie 'sthanarthi sreekuttan' eight schools in kerala and one in punjab have altered seating inside classrooms.

Shirsat, however, rubbished the claim, saying the bag only contained clothes.The allegation came a day after it emerged that Shirsat had received a notice from the income tax department seeking an explanation for increase in his financial worth between the 2019 and 2024 assembly elections from Rs 3.3 crore to Rs 35 crore. Last month, Shirsat and his son withdrew from a hotel deal after an opposition outcry.Raut said in his post that Union home minister Amit Shah should take note. “I feel pity for CM Devendra Fadnavis! How many more times will he just sit and watch his reputation being torn to shreds? Helplessness has another name: Fadnavis!” Shirsat said in response, “The house seen in the video is my home. It shows I am sitting (clad in a vest) in my bedroom. My pet dog and a bag are also seen. This means I have just returned from travel and removed my clothes. If I have to keep such a big bag of money, is there a dearth of cupboards?” Criticizing the opposition for raking up the issue “deliberately,” Shirsat said, “They see (currency) notes even in cloth bags.” He added, “Had there been money, I would have kept it in the cupboard.”Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray said sarcastically that Mahayuti legislators were showing disregard for the rule framed by Modi govt that a person should not handle cash beyond Rs 2 lakh on a given day. Raut and Thackeray expressed their apprehensions about whether action would be taken against Shirsat and Sena MLA Sanjay Gaikwad (who assaulted MLA hostel canteen staffers) when their videos, they said, were “good enough to prove their crime.”Shirsat said, “Such claims won’t affect my (political) career.” Shirsat had told the media on Thursday he had sought more time to reply to the I-T department’s notice asking for an explanation for the increase in his financial worth. However, he had to backtrack on his remark that Kalyan MP Shrikant Shinde had received a similar notice and later clarified that he had no knowledge of Shrikant Shinde receiving any I-T notice.Shirsat, an MLA from Sambhajinagar West, had declared Rs 44.8 crore in cash and liabilities of Rs 26.5 crore in loans from multiple banks in his election affidavit in Oct 2024.
