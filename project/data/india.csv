NEW DELHI: Saying that time has come for it to decide on the passive euthanasia plea regarding 31-year-old Harish Rana, who has been in a vegetative state for the last 13 years, Supreme Court on Thursday decided to talk to his parents before it moves further in the matter.Significantly, the secondary report filed by AIIMS medical board, as was directed by SC, is similar to the primary medical board’s report, which had said that there is negligible chance of the man’s recovery.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan called AIIMS Delhi’s secondary medical report a “sad” one and said it wanted to talk to the parents in person before moving ahead.It requested them to come to court on Jan 13 when it would interact with them in the chamber. The court also directed its registry to furnish the AIIMS medical report to additional SG Aishwarya Bhati.The Supreme Court also directed its registry to furnish the AIIMS medical report additional SG and advocate Rashmi Nandakumar, who is appearing for Harish's father. “We have reached a stage wherein we will have to take a final call. So, your thorough assistance will be required. We will ask the registry to provide you with one copy of the report.Study the report. You will have to assist us. It's a very sad report, and it will be a big challenge for us also, but we can't keep the boy like this for all time to come,” it told both the lawyers.The bench also asked the two lawyers to meet and interact with Harish’s parents and his siblings to discuss the issue before the next date of hearing.“In pursuance of our last order dated Dec 11, a secondary medical board was constituted by AIIMS, New Delhi. The team of doctors medically examined the patient, and a report has been forwarded. The report consists of the medical history, general examination, neurological examination and other observations made and diagnostic criteria. We direct the registry to provide each copy to Ms Rashmi and Ms Aishwarya Bhati, learned ASG. We request them to look into the report and study the same and assist us in the report. We request them to jointly speak to the parents and other family members of Harish Rana and give us a report in that regard,” the bench said.As per the procedure framed by SC on passive euthanasia, a decision to withdraw artificial life support is to be made after the primary and secondary medical boards concur. In case of contradictory reports from the two, the matter is to be decided by court, which may constitute an independent committee to depute three doctors from the fields of general medicine, cardiology, neurology, nephrology, psychiatry or oncology, with experience in critical care and with overall standing in the medical profession of at least 20 years.Harish had fallen from the fourth floor on Aug 20, 2013. He was treated at various hospitals, but his condition did not improve. His father had first moved Delhi HC, which refused his plea to refer the case to a primary medical board.Last week, the court went through the report of the primary medical board set up by Noida District Hospital and said, “The bare reading of the letter would indicate Harish is in a pathetic condition.”","Court asks two lawyers to meet & interact with harish’s parents, siblings.

VB - G RAM G row: Opposition sleeps outside Parliament in protest - watch video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vb-g-ram-g-bill-opposition-stages-overnight-protest-in-parliament-over-mgnrega-replacement-video/articleshow/126067758.cms,"Lok Sabha Passes Viksit Bharat G Ram G Bill Amid Protests, Opposition Tears Copies Over Gandhi Name

NEW DELHI: Opposition parties staged a 12-hour overnight dharna in the Parliament complex on Thursday night to protest the passage of the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill, or VB-G RAM G Bill, which replaces the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act.The protest came hours after Parliament cleared the Bill amid noisy scenes and walkouts. The Rajya Sabha passed the legislation post midnight by a voice vote, following its approval by the Lok Sabha earlier in the day, even as opposition members demanded its withdrawal and sought its referral to a parliamentary panel.Opposition MPs accused the government of rushing the Bill through without adequate debate and of scrapping a flagship rural employment scheme that, they said, supported crores of poor households. Several members walked out of the Upper House, raised slogans against the government and tore copies of the Bill, prompting repeated warnings from the Chair.Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha deputy leader Sagarika Ghose alleged that the government had “bulldozed” the legislation. “This is an insult to India's poor, it is an insult to Mahatma Gandhi, it is an insult to Rabindranath Tagore. With just five hours' notice, this bill was given to us.We were not allowed a proper debate,” she said.“Our demand was such an important bill should be sent to the Select Committee and let the opposition parties examine it, let the opposition parties discuss it, let all stakeholders discuss it, but no, in a display of tyranny, in a murder of democracy,” Ghose said, announcing the overnight protest. “We are now going to sit on a 12-hour dharna, 12-hour dharna against the manner in which the Modi government has brought this black law against the people of India, against the poor of India, against the rural poor of India. ”Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala described the development as a “sad day for the country's labour force” and alleged that the government had hit the livelihoods of millions. “This is perhaps the saddest day for the labourers of India. BJP government has attacked the livelihood of 12 crore people by repealing the MGNREGA . They have proved that the Modi government is anti-farmer and anti-poor,” he said.Congress leader Mukul Wasnik said the original law was framed after extensive consultations. “When MGNREGA was drafted, consultations were held for 14 months. It was passed by Parliament with consensus. The scheme would put an extreme burden on states. As a result, this scheme will collapse,” he said.DMK leader Tiruchi Siva accused the government of erasing Mahatma Gandhi’s legacy. “Likewise they have removed Mahatma Gandhi's name himself. Without Gandhi there is no freedom, that is the total belief in this country. Even in Britain parliament we are having Gandhi statue, but here in Indian parliament his statue is hidden somewhere, and now the scheme which bore his name, his name has also been removed,” he said.Defending the legislation, Rural Development Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the new law was necessary to address shortcomings in the old scheme and to boost rural development. “This Bill is very necessary as it will help provide employment opportunities, help development of rural India and take the country forward,” he said while replying to the debate in the Rajya Sabha.Chouhan accused the Congress of misusing Mahatma Gandhi’s name for political gains and of disrupting parliamentary proceedings. “I heard the opposition with patience all these hours and expected the opposition to hear my response to the discussion. Making their points, making allegations and running away is like murdering the dreams and ideals of Mahatma Gandhi,” he said.“The entire nation is watching their 'goondagardi' and the opposition is committing the sin of insulting democracy. House 'dadagiri se nahin chalega',” the minister added.He also cited funding figures to defend the government’s record, claiming that while the previous UPA government released Rs 2.13 lakh crore for MGNREGA, the NDA had released nearly Rs 8.53 lakh crore. The opposition, however, maintained that the passage of the Bill without detailed scrutiny set a dangerous precedent and said it would take its protest against the law to the streets across the country.","Lok sabha passes viksit bharat g ram g bill amid protests, opposition tears copies over gandhi name.

AQI Severe-Plus, Delhi’s Worst In More Than 1 Yr

Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

NEW DELHI: A dense blanket of fog enveloped Delhi-NCR on Monday morning, severely reducing visibility across roads and disrupting normal movement, while the region continued to grapple with toxic air quality in the ‘severe-plus’ category. The deteriorating weather and pollution conditions also impacted air travel, prompting IndiGo Airlines to issue a travel advisory warning passengers of possible delays and urging them to plan their journeys with extra caution.Amid changing weather conditions, IndiGo Airlines on Monday issued a travel advisory for passengers as Delhi witnessed the first signs of winter fog this season, impacting visibility at the airport.In its advisory, the airline said visibility levels around the airport were currently reduced, and as a result, flight operations were being adjusted, with some departures likely to take longer than usual. IndiGo assured passengers that its teams remain available to provide support, acknowledging that travel plans, schedules, and connections are important.The airline also cautioned that road traffic could be slower due to foggy conditions and advised passengers to plan their journeys accordingly and allow additional time to reach the airport.IndiGo said it is closely monitoring the situation and will keep passengers informed, adding that departures will continue as conditions improve, with safety remaining the top priority.Similarly Air India issued a travel advisory for passengers; it said, ""Poor visibility due to dense fog is impacting flight operations in Delhi and parts of Northern India. Please check your flight status at: http://airindia.com/in/en/manage/flight-status.html before heading to the airport.""Earlier on Sunday, Delhiites could literally see poison in the air. A thick layer of toxic smog enveloped the capital, turning the city into a gas chamber with air quality plunging to 'severe-plus' category for the first time this year.The city's 24-hour average air quality index stood at 461, the second-worst recorded in Dec and the worst in nearly 13 months. Since the scale began in April 2015, only once has a higher AQI been recorded in Dec - 469 on Dec 21, 2017. For any month, the last time Delhiites a suffered worst AQI was on Nov 18 last year (494).High moisture, low temperatures and calm winds effectively trapped pollution close to the surface even as a grey smog screened out the sun for most of the day. Winds are predicted to pick up slightly post-noon on Monday, which could disperse some pollutants.On Sunday, atmospheric ‘inversion’ made the situation worse. This occurs when cooler air near the ground gets trapped under warmer air above, stopping pollutants from dispersing. Though meteorological conditions remained unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants, local emissions continued to remain high.“This is a true depiction of Delhi’s local emissions because wind speeds are almost zero, meaning there is hardly any inflow or outflow of air. Vertical ventilation is confined to a column of just 600 metres, which means whatever remains in the box — Delhi — is largely its own emissions. Under these conditions, the contribution of dust is negligible. When dust is released from construction activity, it usually spreads to other areas due to wind, but with winds nearly calm, it cannot pollute places beyond the immediate site of release,” said Gufran Beig, founder of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) and Chair Professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS).Of the total 39 active air quality monitoring stations, 38 saw ‘severe’ AQI while only Shadipur was placed in the ‘very poor’ category at 375. Of these, three stations — Wazirpur, Rohini and Ashok Vihar — maxed out at 500, while several others reported AQI above 490.This is the second spell of severe air days in Delhi this season. The city had recorded three consecutive severe days from Nov 11 to 13. In this winter season, the city has recorded five such days, when AQI surpassed 400.After air quality started rapidly deteriorating on Saturday, the Graded Response Action Plan’s stage III was imposed in the morning. Stage IV was invoked on Saturday evening as AQI showed no sign of improvement. Currently, all stages of GRAP are in force.Delhi’s highest-ever AQI of 497 was recorded on Nov 6, 2016. The second-worst air quality day followed on Nov 18 last year with AQI reaching 494.Experts said since winds are likely to rise only marginally post-noon, no significant respite from toxic air quality is expected on Monday. However, the Centre’s Air Quality Early Warning System (EWS) stated that the AQI may dip to ‘very poor’ on Monday. “Delhi’s air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ category from Dec 15 till 17. The outlook for the subsequent six days from Dec 18 is that AQI is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ category,” said the EWS.The CPCB classifies AQI 050 as 'good', 51-100 as 'satisfactory', 101-200 as 'moderate', 201300 as 'poor', 301-400 as 'very poor', 401-450 as 'severe', and 451 and above as ‘severe plus.’ Meanwhile, the lowest visibility on Sunday morning was recorded at 200 metres at Safdarjung. It was 350 metres at Palam. “Safdarjung reported 300 metres at 5.30am but calm winds further reduced the visibility to 200 metres at 8am,” said a Met official.India Meteorological Department measures fog in terms of visibility. Visibility between 500-1,000 metres is considered ‘shallow’ fog. Fog is 'moderate' when visibility is between 200-500 metres, and ‘dense’ below 200 metres.The maximum temperature was recorded at 24 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. The minimum stood at 8.2 degrees C. IMD has predicted shallow to moderate fog in the early hours of Monday.","A dense blanket of fog enveloped delhi-ncr on monday morning, severely reducing visibility across roads and disrupting normal movement.

A shrinking global water reserve



Groundwater: India’s invisible lifeline



States/cities staring at ‘Day Zero’



The most vulnerable regions are concentrated in three broad zones:

Northwest India: Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh — where groundwater recharge exists but indiscriminate withdrawal, driven largely by agriculture, has led to over-extraction.

Rajasthan and parts of Gujarat — where arid conditions limit natural recharge. Southern peninsular India: including Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, where hard, crystalline aquifers have low storage capacity.

NITI Aayog has warned that 21 major Indian cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru and Chennai, face the risk of depleting their groundwater reserves.

Bengaluru water crisis

Why is India running out of water?



Rising demand: India’s water demand is expected to outstrip supply by 2030

Agricultural overuse: Water-intensive crops like paddy in Punjab and Haryana

Encroachment of water bodies: Lakes and ponds disappearing, especially in cities like Bengaluru

Climate change: Erratic monsoons and declining river flows

Pollution: Industrial waste, sewage, and mining contaminating groundwater

Weak regulation: Outdated laws like the Easement Act of 1882, which ties groundwater ownership to land

Fragmented governance: Separate authorities for surface and groundwater management

Public apathy: Water treated as a free, unlimited resource

Groundwater overuse and contamination



Nearly 70% of groundwater sources are contaminated

India ranks 120th out of 122 countries on the global water quality index

State and UT-wise classification shows:

Over-exploited (>100%): Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan

Critical (90–100%): Delhi

High stress (70–90%): Tamil Nadu and Puducherry

Moderate to low stress (<70%): All remaining states and UTs, including Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, West Bengal, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and several northeastern states.

The invisible crisis beneath our feet



Behind this lies a darker reality, an informal and often illegal groundwater trade.

In a narrow lane of India, men and women wait quietly with plastic drums lined in rows. Some squat, some sit, with eyes fixed on the bend ahead.Suddenly, the silence breaks. A water tanker reverses into the alley, its engine drowning out the waiting. Young men rush forward, climbing atop the truck, lowering pipes into the tank. Within moments, quiet order unravels into chaos.Hundreds of kilometres away, in rural India, women walk long distances to empty wells, dried-up tubewells and shrinking water bodies, hoping to find a few litres of water.Just because some cities suffered floods doesn’t mean you have water. For a country that supports nearly 17% of the world’s population with just 4% of its freshwater resources, water scarcity has become a daily reality, and not just a distant threat.With India’s population expected to rise from 1.3 billion to nearly 1.7 billion by 2050, the question is no longer whether India is facing a water crisis.But how soon parts of the country will run out!A water crisis occurs when the availability of safe, usable water falls short of demand. The World Bank defines water scarcity as a situation where annual per capita water availability drops below 1,000 cubic metres.India is steadily moving towards this threshold.Despite supporting 17% of the world’s population, India has access to only 4% of global freshwater resources. According to NITI Aayog's Composite Water Management Index (CWMI), the country is facing the worst water crisis in its history, with nearly 600 million people experiencing high to extreme water stress.India’s per capita water availability stood at 1,486 cubic metres in 2021, placing it in the water-stressed category (below 1,700 cubic metres). Government estimates suggest this could fall further to 1,341 cubic metres by 2025 and 1,140 cubic metres by 2050, pushing large parts of the country closer to scarcity.Globally, freshwater reserves have declined sharply over the last two decades, with losses estimated at 324 billion cubic metres every year, enough to meet the annual water needs of 280 million people.According to the Union minister of Jal Shakti releases Dynamic Ground Water Resource Assessment Report of the Country for the Year 2025, “Groundwater assessment units across India are categorised as safe, semi critical, critical and over exploited, based on the ratio of annual groundwater extraction and replenishment in the phreatic aquifer. The assigned categories aid in planning, management, and regulation of the country's groundwater resources. ”Water consumption worldwide increased by 25% between 2000 and 2019, with nearly a third of that growth occurring in already water-stressed regions, the report stated.Northern India figures prominently among these drying zones, alongside parts of northern China, Central America and the southwestern United States. Rising temperatures, erratic rainfall, worsening droughts and unsustainable land and water use have accelerated the decline.For India, the implications are stark. Agriculture, livelihoods, urban growth and ecological sustainability all hinge on groundwater, the country’s most heavily used and least regulated water source.Groundwater forms the backbone of India’s water security. According to the 2019 NITI Aayog report, the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB) stated that the contribution of groundwater is nearly 62% in irrigation, 85% in rural water supply and 45% in urban water supply.Yet this invisible lifeline is being drawn down faster than it can be replenished. As per the Dynamic Ground Water Resource Assessment 2025, India’s total annual groundwater recharge stands at 448.52 billion cubic metres (bcm).After accounting for natural discharge, the annual extractable resource is estimated at 407.75 bcm. Current extraction has reached 247.22 bcm, pushing the national stage of groundwater extraction to about 60.6%.While the national average may suggest moderate stress, the reality on the ground is far more uneven.Out of the total 6,762 assessment units, around 25% have been categorised as Overexploited, Critical, or Semi-Critical. These are areas where extraction is approaching or exceeding natural recharge, a warning sign that aquifers are under severe stress.States with the highest proportion of over-exploited and critical units include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Delhi. In Punjab, groundwater extraction stands at over 156% of annual recharge. Rajasthan follows closely at 147%, while Delhi’s extraction level exceeds 90%, placing it in the critical category.Urban centres are not immune.Chennai already experienced ‘day zero’ in June 2019, when all four major reservoirs of the big city reservoirs ran dry. People had to line up for hours to wait for a small allocation of water brought in by trucks from other areas.A BBC report, citing UN projections, ranked Bengaluru second after Brazil’s São Paulo, among 11 global cities at risk of running out of drinking water. As water levels drop and summer temperatures rise, cities are imposing restrictions.Lakhs of residents across the 'city of dreams,' Mumbai are too grappling with acute water scarcity. In Bengaluru, authorities have banned the use of potable water for non-essential activities such as washing cars and watering gardens. Yet questions remain over whether fines and regulations alone can avert a full-blown crisis.In rural areas, the crisis manifests differently, in longer walks for water, abandoned wells and failed crops.Experts point to multiple, interconnected causes:India is the largest user of groundwater in the world, accounting for over 25% of global groundwater extraction. The consequences are severe:Groundwater extraction in India is assessed using data from the Minor Irrigation Census and sample surveys conducted by State Ground Water Departments. According to the National Compilation on Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India, 2025, the country’s total annual groundwater extraction is estimated at 247.22 billion cubic metres (bcm).The agriculture sector remains the largest consumer, accounting for 87% of total extraction, or 215.10 bcm. Domestic use contributes 11% (27.89 bcm), while industrial use accounts for the remaining 2% (4.23 bcm).Water-intensive cropping patterns, such as paddy cultivation in Punjab and Haryana, and it continues to strain aquifers, even in regions where rainfall is relatively adequate. As India’s population grows and incomes rise, food demand is expected to surge.According to the NITI report, India’s population is expected to increase to 1.66 billion by 2050. At the same time, per capita income is estimated to increase by 5.5% per annum. With increasing population and purchasing power, the annual food requirement in the country will exceed 250 million tons by 2050. The total demand for grains will increase to 375 million tons including grain for feeding livestock by 2050.”“This will increase the demand for food. The surge in demand for these water-intensive crops will, ceteris paribus, multiply our current agricultural consumption of water,” it added.Despite a national average that masks local crises, groundwater stress is highly concentrated. More than 25% of administrative units fall under over-exploited, critical or semi-critical categories in nine states and UTs: Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Puducherry.These regions face the highest risk of aquifer depletion, underscoring the urgent need for targeted groundwater management, crop diversification and demand-side interventions.Rainfall remains the primary source of groundwater recharge in India, but its distribution varies widely across regions and seasons. Most of the country receives rainfall during the southwest monsoon, while long dry spells dominate the rest of the year.Groundwater levels typically fall before the monsoon and recover partially during and after it. However, CGWB data shows that in 2024, more than 57% of monitored wells recorded a fall in water levels compared to the previous year, with significant declines observed in states such as Punjab, Rajasthan, Delhi, Maharashtra, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.Geology further complicates the picture.According to the National Compilation on Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India, 2025, Karnataka’s annual groundwater recharge is estimated at 19.27 bcm, while extractable resources stand at 17.41 bcm. While recharge and extractable resources have increased marginally from 2024, extraction has also risen slightly. Overall, the state has seen a modest improvement, with extraction levels dropping from 68.44% in 2024 to 66.49% in 2025.Central Maharashtra, a drought-prone region receiving only 400–700 mm of rainfall annually, remains heavily dependent on groundwater. The state’s annual groundwater recharge is estimated at 33.89 bcm, with extractable resources of 31.99 bcm. Extraction stands at 16.57 bcm, translating to a stage of extraction of 51.79% — a slight improvement from 2024.Punjab remains among the most over-exploited states. Its annual groundwater extraction (26.27 bcm) far exceeds its extractable resource (16.8 bcm), pushing the stage of groundwater extraction to 156.36%.Although extraction has marginally declined from 2024, the state continues to draw far more water than it replenishes, largely due to water-intensive agriculture.Rajasthan’s groundwater situation is similarly alarming. With an annual extraction of 17.10 bcm against extractable resources of 11.62 bcm, the stage of extraction stands at 147.11%. Despite slight improvements in recharge, over-extraction remains entrenched.Delhi’s groundwater extraction stands at 92.10%, placing it in the critical category. While extraction has reduced slightly since 2024, the city remains heavily dependent on groundwater to meet domestic demand.address India’s growing water crisis, the government has rolled out a series of initiatives aimed at conservation, recharge, and equitable access to water. One of the key programmes is the Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), launched in 2019 as a nationwide movement to promote water conservation, groundwater recharge and rainwater harvesting.Another major intervention is the Atal Bhujal Yojana, which emphasises sustainable groundwater management through community participation, improved recharge and regulated extraction.In urban areas, the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) 2.0 supports rainwater harvesting through stormwater drainage systems and promotes groundwater recharge via aquifer management plans.The Centre has also launched the Amrit Sarovar initiative, under which 50,000 water bodies, each roughly one acre in size, are being developed across the country to enhance local water storage and recharge.To improve transparency and monitoring, the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has developed a GIS-based public platform called the India Groundwater Resource Estimation System (IN-GRES). The portal visualises groundwater recharge, extraction, rainfall and categorisation at the level of individual assessment units, allowing comparisons with previous years.Yet, even as policies and programmes expand on paper, a parallel and troubling reality persists.India’s water crisis is not just about scarcity, but governance. Groundwater ownership laws dating back to the Easement Act of 1882 allow landowners to extract water beneath their land with few restrictions.Fragmented water management, weak enforcement and limited public awareness have allowed overuse to continue unchecked.While government initiatives, from the Jal Shakti Abhiyan and Atal Bhujal Yojana to large-scale rainwater harvesting and aquifer mapping programmes, aim to reverse the trend, experts may warn that without behavioural change and strict regulation, these measures may not be enough.Water budgeting, which treats water like a financial account, balancing availability against demand is also increasingly being seen as a crucial tool to identify stressed regions before they reach breaking point.Tankers extract water from over-exploited aquifers, frequently without regulation or quality checks, accelerating depletion while raising concerns over contamination.For now, the scenes of tankers, queues and dried wells serve as a warning. India may not be out of water yet, but in many places, it is running out of time. This underground trade, operating largely unchecked risks pushing India towards a long-term groundwater collapse tomorrow.","Niti aayog has warned that 21 major indian cities face the risk of depleting their groundwater reserves. The most vulnerable regions are concentrated in three broad zones: punjab, haryana, delhi and western uttar pradesh. Despite supporting 17% of the world’s population, india has access to only 4% of global freshwater resources.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126059201,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-112698,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Rahul Gandhi’s fading charm

NEW DELHI: The Congress 's internal churn burst into the open again recently after former Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim wrote to Sonia Gandhi, calling for ""open-heart surgery"" in the party and flagging a growing disconnect between the leadership and its workers.Similar concerns were raised in the run-up to the Bihar assembly elections this year in November, where the distance between the ""leadership"" and the workers was on display during seat distribution talks.Since its formation in 1885, the Congress has had problem of plenty. There were too many popular leaders, too many dedicated party workers and too many loyal supporters during the country’s freedom struggle.After Independence, the country rallied behind Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and the Congress, helping the party win almost every election. To its credit, the party served as a broad canopy under which different ideologies co-existed.Cut to the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha election: everything seemed to go against the grand old party. After a 10-year run at the Centre, the Congress found itself reeling under corruption charges, anti-incumbency and a sudden exodus of senior leaders just ahead of the polls. The final nail in the coffin was the ""Modi wave"", which helped the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sweep away the general election.Since then, the stars have not aligned for the Congress. The party continues to face more or less the same problems it did a decade ago. It remains plagued by infighting, disillusioned workers and senior leaders jumping ship after flagging serious leadership issues.In his letter to Sonia Gandhi dated December 8, ex-Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim highlighted six consecutive election losses in Odisha and three in Lok Sabha while also questioning the selection of Mallikarjun Kharge as the party's leader, claiming that the 83-year-old veteran ""is unable to resonate with India's youth.""In his five-page letter, he also complained that he had not been granted an audience with Rahul Gandhi for almost three years. “This is not a personal grievance … but a reflection of a wider emotional disconnect felt by workers across India, who feel unseen and unheard,” he wrote.This is not the first time a party leader has complained about not getting an audience with the Congress scion. The list has only grown longer. Leaders such as Himanta Biswa Sarma, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Jitin Prasada have quit the Congress and joined rival parties after raising similar concerns.This raises a key question: why are so many leaders disgruntled with the grand old party, and why is it steadily losing its cadre across states?After suffering a debacle in the 2014 general election at the hands of the BJP, the Congress has lost more elections than it has won. Even after a promising performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, the party soon lost steam.The sharpest slide came in the Maharashtra Assembly elections, where the Congress was reduced to just 16 seats. In Bihar, its tally halved from 12 to six, while in Haryana - where it hoped to convert Lok Sabha momentum into victory - it slipped from 42 to 37. Even in Delhi, where the Congress was trying to claw back to relevance, the party drew a blank for the third consecutive time.The only two states where the Congress did marginally better - Jammu & Kashmir and Jharkhand - were ones where it fought as a junior partner in a coalition.In political alliances, chemistry between parties is paramount. Historically, however, many regional parties allied with the Congress were either born out of splits from it or emerged from anti-Congress sentiment.This unequal match often creates friction for the grand old party. For instance, the Congress’s alliance with the National Conference in Jammu and Kashmir appeared to be on the brink of collapse following sharp differences.Chief minister Omar Abdullah has, on several occasions, publicly expressed displeasure over the Congress’s decision to launch a campaign for the restoration of statehood without consulting its ally.Similarly, the Congress’s relationship with the Aam Aadmi Party has been turbulent within the INDIA bloc. After prolonged seat-sharing negotiations and resistance from the Congress’s Delhi unit, the two parties fought together in Delhi, Gujarat and Haryana in the Lok Sabha polls, but against each other in Punjab.Last year, they failed to reach a consensus on seat-sharing in the Haryana Assembly elections and contested separately. In the Delhi Assembly elections earlier this year as well, both parties fought a bitter battle, raising questions over how the two would function as allies within the INDIA bloc.In such situations, party workers on the ground - wired to defend their own party - often find themselves confused while coordinating with alliance partners who hold opposing ideological positions.The Congress 'high command' is also frequently accused of taking too long to act when power tussles erupt within state units.As an ongoing standoff between Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar forces the leadership into repeated deliberations, no decisive call has yet been taken.Similar leadership tussles played out in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, where factionalism among state leaders eventually contributed to the party losing power. The common thread across these states has been the Congress leadership’s reluctance to act decisively in battles between the old guard and younger turks.In Rajasthan, Sachin Pilot - who as state president had led the party to a decisive victory in 2018 - staked claim to the chief minister’s post. The party, however, backed veteran Ashok Gehlot, who had led the Congress to defeat in 2013. Pilot and his supporters were left disappointed. When he intensified his campaign for the top job, Gehlot used his influence to quell the rebellion. Though the Gandhi family persuaded Pilot to stay, the high command’s bet on Gehlot failed, with the party losing the state in 2024.Several Congress leaders, including Sanjay Nirupam, have alleged that the party suffers from multiple power centres, each backed by its own lobby.Expelled from the party in 2024, Nirupam claimed there was no future for the Congress and accused the leadership of “tremendous arrogance”.“Earlier there was one power centre in the Congress. Now there are five - Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Mallikarjun Kharge and general secretary KC Venugopal. All have their own lobbies, which keep clashing. In the middle of this, lakhs of workers like me are stuck,” Nirupam had said.In the Bihar assembly elections, Rahul Gandhi once again failed to make an impact. His Voter Adhikar Yatra, launched just days before polling, did not turn out to be the trump card the party was hoping it would. His repeated attacks on the Election Commission and allegations of “vote theft” also failed to resonate with voters.After the yatra, Rahul remained largely absent, returning to the campaign trail only in the last leg. His absence became a major issue amid unrest within party ranks, with leaders alleging discrepancies in ticket distribution.As the polls approached, cracks within the Congress’s Bihar unit resurfaced. Rebel leaders, including several MLAs, staged protests after being denied tickets and demanded the immediate replacement of the party’s Bihar in-charge, Krishna Allavaru, with a “political” appointee. As expected, the writing was on the wall and the party emerged as the weakest link in its alliance, recording the lowest strike rate among the major partners.The Congress seems to be mired in a cycle of post-mortems, exits, and letters for the time being, while its rival BJP is busy expanding its presence on the ground. As the five states/UT, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Kerala and Puducherry, gear up for the high-stakes elections next year, the real test no longer remains about winning for Congress, but whether the party can still reform itself in time.","Former odisha mla mohammed moquim wrote to sonia gandhi, calling for ""open-heart surgery"" in the party. Similar concerns were raised in the run-up to the bihar assembly elections this year in november. The party continues to face more or less the same problems it did a decade ago.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126055772,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-675752,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday announced that the state government’s job scheme ‘Karmashree’ will be renamed after Mahatma Gandhi , saying she felt “ashamed” that the Father of the Nation’s name was being removed from welfare scheme at the national level.Speaking at a public event, Banerjee said the scheme, which provides 75 to 100 days of employment, would be renamed to honour Mahatma Gandhi, asserting that the state would uphold the legacy of national leaders if the Centre fails to do so.“We have started a scheme ‘Karmashree’, Gandhi ji name is not there. I’m really sorry, I'm ashamed. I’m feeling shame, father of the nation, MGNREGA program named after him, now the bill came Gandhi ji name won’t be there,” Banerjee said.She added, “I can’t blame anybody except me because I belong to this country. I'm feeling ashamed because we are even forgetting the father of the nation.”The CM said the scheme’s name would now be changed to reflect Mahatma Gandhi’s legacy. “So we have started a scheme called ‘Karmashree’, it’s name will be changed to Mahatma ji scheme. It will also give 75 to 100 days of job…we’re not beggars,” she said.Banerjee also took a swipe at the Centre, saying, “We only won’t respect nothing else, if you will not give respect to Mahatma ji we will.”In her address, Banerjee invoked several national leaders, what she described as Bengal’s inclusive ethos.“We know how to give respect to Mahatma ji, Neta Ji, Guru dev Rabindranath, Baba Sahaeb Ambedkar, Maulana Abul kalam, Sardar Patel, Lal Bal Pal, we love every community,” she said.The remarks come amid an ongoing political row over changes made to the name of MGNREGA, including the omission of Mahatma Gandhi’s name from official titles, which the TMC and other opposition parties have criticised.",Cm mamata banerjee renames west bengal's job guarantee scheme 'karmashree' after mahatma gandhi.

Nitish Kumar's Hijab Shocker: BJP MP Giriraj Singh Defends Bihar CM's Act With 'Go To Hell' Remark

What was the controversy?

Opposition calls it 'cheap mentality':

NEW DELHI: Union minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh on Thursday defended Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar after a video showing him pulling down the hijab of a woman doctor during an official programme went viral. He claimed that there was “nothing wrong” in the chief minister’s action.On reportedly being asked about the woman at the centre of the row may refuse to take up the government job, Singh said it was up to the woman to refuse the government job or “go to hell”. He added that Kumar “has done nothing wrong” and framed the incident as a procedural act.“Whether she refuses the job or goes to hell, that is her choice,” Singh said.Defending Nitish, the union minister argued that the incident should not be viewed through a religious lens and described the chief minister’s action as that of a guardian verifying identity at an official function.“If someone is going to collect an appointment letter, should they not show their face? Is this some Islamic country? Nitish Kumar acted as a guardian,” Singh said.Drawing parallels with other official procedures, he added, “When you go to get a passport, do you not show your face? When you go to the airport, do you not show your face? People talk about Pakistan and Englishtan, but this is India.In India, the rule of law prevails.”The controversy stems from an incident earlier this week during an appointment letter distribution programme for newly recruited AYUSH doctors at the chief minister’s residence in Patna.A video shared by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on X shows Nitish Kumar on stage alongside deputy chief minister Samrat Choudhary and health minister Mangal Pandey.When a woman doctor, identified as Nusrat Parveen, approached the stage with her face covered by a hijab, Kumar appeared displeased, remarked “What is this?”, bent down and pulled the veil down.The woman was seen visibly flustered as an official moved her aside, while Samrat Choudhary appeared to tug at Kumar’s sleeve, seemingly trying to restrain him.According to the Chief Minister’s Office, the programme involved the distribution of appointment letters to 1,283 AYUSH doctors, including Ayurveda, Homeopathy and Unani practitioners, with only 10 receiving letters in person and the rest online.The incident and union minister's comments drew sharp criticism from opposition parties. Congress MP Tariq Anwar called Singh’s statement indicative of a “cheap mentality” and condemned Kumar’s action as “shameful and saddening”.""These are third-rate people, they have a cheap mindset. They dont understand that our country is secular. Everyone is free to practice their religion. What Nitish Kumar has done is shameful and saddening,"" Anwar said.Reacting to Singh's statement, J&K CM Omar Abdullah said: ""This is exactly what we can expect from the BJP. If it had been a Hindu woman from Rajasthan or Haryana, wearing a veil, and I had removed it, would the BJP have said the same thing? Imagine the uproar if a Muslim leader had removed the veil of a Hindu woman. But now, because it was a Muslim woman doctor, the BJP's reaction is different. What else can we expect from them?""Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Iltija Mufti also expressed outrage, saying such remarks and acts are deeply offensive to Muslim women.""Only phenyl will work to clean this man's filthy mouth. You dare not touch the hijabs & naqabs of our Muslim mothers and sisters. Otherwise we Muslim women will set you right by teaching you a lesson you and your ilk will remember for all times to come,"" she said in a post on X.NCP (SP) MP Fauzia Khan also hit out at both leaders.""It is very saddening that responsible people do such acts, this will send a wrong message in the world. It is a personal decision of a woman as to how much she covers up and removing the veil is akin to disrobing a woman. He (Kumar) should have given a pubic apology but instead of that they are saying that what happened was right,"" she said.RJD MP Manoj Jha said the visuals were “unsettling” and raised serious concerns, adding that such actions did not send a good message from the state’s top constitutional authority.The Congress also came down heavily on the Bihar chief minister, calling the act “shameless” and “vile” and demanding his resignation.Congress MP Sukhdeo Bhagat said the incident was condemnable and violated traditions and faith, while the party said publicly humiliating a woman at a government event raised questions about women’s safety and dignity.""This does not seem appropriate from any angle. Treating a woman like this is condemnable,” Bhagat said.Leaders from other opposition parties echoed similar concerns. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi said no one, regardless of position, had the right to publicly humiliate an adult woman for her choice of attire, stressing that equality must be rooted in consent. The AAP also criticised the incident, warning against normalising control over women’s choices.Amid the outrage, the BJP sought to counter the criticism by sharing an old video of former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot removing a woman’s ghoonghat, arguing that the opposition was being selective in its outrage. BJP leaders also accused opposition parties of politicising the issue for electoral gains.The row further escalated after Uttar Pradesh minister Sanjay Nishad made controversial remarks defending Kumar, which were widely criticised as misogynistic.Nishad later said his comments were misunderstood due to translation issues and offered to withdraw them if they had hurt sentiments, even as opposition parties continued to demand an unconditional apology.",Bihar chief minister nitish kumar pulled down the hijab of a woman doctor during an official programme.

Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

NEW DELHI: Advocate Vishnu Joshi, representing a victim’s family in the Goa nightclub fire case, on Wednesday said that one of the Luthra brothers requested a Dunlop mattress during police remand.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before granting custody. Speaking to reporters, he said, “Today, when the Goa Police presented them in court, one accused, during their arguments, claimed he had spinal issues and other health problems. He requested that they be provided with a Dunlop mattress during their police remand. The state strongly opposed this... Their pre-medical examination showed them to be perfectly fit. ”He added that the duo had attempted to evade legal proceedings since fleeing India.“Since these people (Luthra brothers) absconded and fled the country, they have been employing tactics to somehow escape. First, they filed an anticipatory bail application on vague grounds in the Rohini Court, even though that court had no jurisdiction... But that bail application was rejected. Since then, they have been trying wherever they get a chance to obtain some kind of relaxation,” Joshi said.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before ordering custody.“The brothers claimed to be suffering from back pain. The court considered all submissions and directed the police to first conduct a pre-medical examination and re-examination. No medical necessity was found, following which the court, exercising its full authority, granted five days of police remand,” he said.The Luthra brothers, owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, were remanded to five-day police custody by the Mapusa Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) court.They were brought back to Goa from Thailand following their deportation and produced before the court after undergoing multiple medical examinations.After landing at Manohar International Airport, Mopa, under police escort around 10.45 am, the duo was taken to a primary health centre in Siolim and then to the District Hospital in Mapusa. The court directed fresh medical examinations before ordering the five-day custody to allow investigators to question them regarding alleged safety lapses at the club.The blaze broke out on December 6 around 11.45 pm during a crowded event at the nightclub, when electric firecrackers allegedly struck the wooden ceiling. The incident claimed the lives of 25 people, including tourists and staff, while several others were injured.Police said the brothers fled India hours after the incident on December 7, leaving for Thailand while rescue operations were under way. Goa Police launched a nationwide and international manhunt, issued a lookout circular and sought an Interpol Blue Notice.Following their detention by Thai authorities for illegal stay and the suspension of their passports, the brothers were deported to India on emergency travel documents.They landed at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport on Tuesday and were arrested by Goa Police, who obtained a 48-hour transit remand from a Delhi court to facilitate their return to Goa.They have been booked under several provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder and negligence. Investigators have also arrested several others linked to the nightclub’s operations and are probing allegations that the venue was operating with expired licences and without mandatory safety clearances.","Advocate vishnu joshi, representing victim's family, says one of the luthra brothers requested a dunlop mattress during police remand.

End Of MGNREGA? What VB–G Ram G Means For Rural Workers, Farmers And Viksit Bharat Plan

Also Read |

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Thursday passed the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill amid sustained opposition protests, leading to repeated disruptions and the adjournment of the House after a ruckus.The Bill, which replaces the 20-year-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act , seeks to provide a statutory guarantee of 125 days of wage employment in a financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to undertake unskilled manual work.Moving the Bill for consideration and passage, Union rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the legislation would ensure employment and help fulfil Mahatma Gandhi’s vision of self-reliant villages. He said the VB-G RAM G Bill would ensure all-round development of villages, make them poverty-free and fuel their growth journey.Opposition parties, however, mounted a sharp attack on the government over the repeal and renaming of MGNREGA. Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra accused the government of undermining Gandhi’s legacy. She said the Bill was destroying the idea of Ram Rajya both in letter and spirit by repealing MGNREGA and renaming the scheme.Moitra also accused the government of “dishonouring” Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore by removing Gandhi’s name from the landmark rural employment law. Taking a swipe at the ruling dispensation, she said the Bill showed that the government believed in “Na kisi ka saath, na kisi ka vikas, na Rahim ka, na Ram ka”.Opposing the Bill, she said the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act of 2005 had revolutionised rural India’s concept of livelihood security.Congress MP Jai Prakash said removing the name of the Father of the Nation from the legislation was “the biggest crime”. He claimed the proposed law would create fresh financial liabilities for states and deprive grassroots institutions such as gram sabhas of their right to decide on works under the scheme. He termed the Bill “anti-poor” and “anti-Dalit”, alleging it reflected a pro-rich approach.Speaker Om Birla had earlier said the debate on the Bill would take place on Wednesday, with the minister replying on Thursday before it was taken up for passage.Defending the legislation, BJP MP Brijmohan Agarwal said the previous Congress government had reduced MNREGA to a “dig the pit and cover the pit” scheme. He alleged it failed to strengthen the rural economy and led to large-scale corruption. Agarwal said the inclusion of “Ram” in the new law would deter corruption.According to the Bill, states will be required to frame schemes consistent with the new law within six months of the Act coming into force.",The lok sabha on thursday passed the viksit bharat guarantee for rozgar and ajeevika mission (gramin) bill.

‘Not Rummy, Solitaire’: Kokate Blames Staff, Denies Playing Rummy in Assembly

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra Cabinet minister Manikrao Kokate on Thursday submitted his resignation to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar , a day after he was divested of all his ministerial portfolios.Kokate lost all his portfolio after a Nashik court issued warrants for his and his brother Vijay's arrest in a 1995 EWS housing quota cheating case.Kokate has been sentenced to two years of rigorous imprisonment for securing two flats in 1995 under the state's 10 per cent economically weaker sections (EWS) quota by understating their income.CM Devendra Fadanvis accepted Kokate's resignation and forwarded the same to governor Acharya Devvrat for further action.Earlier, Pawar said the ex-minister's resignation had been accepted in principle and was forwarded to CM Fadnavis for due consideration and acceptance.""In keeping with our party’s long-standing philosophy that the rule of law is supreme and above all individuals, the resignation has been accepted in principle. I have forwarded Shri Kokate’s resignation to the Hon’ble CM for due consideration and acceptance, in accordance with constitutional procedure,"" Ajit Pawar wrote on X.Meanwhile, Maharashtra governor Acharya Devvrat has allotted the Sports and Youth Affairs, Minority Affairs, and Waqf ministries, previously held by Manikrao Kokate, to Ajit Pawar.The governor approved the letter sent by Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis in this regard yesterday.Kokate, who is the MLA from Sinnar, is the second NCP politician after Dhananjay Munde to have faced action since the Mahayuti alliance formed government in November 2024. Munde had to step down in March after the CM called for his resignation over allegations linking his associate Valmik Karad to the murder of Massajog sarpanch Santosh Deshmukh.While Nashik commissioner of police Sandeep Karnik said they had received a non-bailable warrant against Kokate and his brother, Bombay high court has posted the hearing of the minister's application for relief on Friday. Kokate got admitted to Mumbai's Leelavati Hospital on Wednesday.Earlier, a section of NCP functionaries demanded that Kokate should resign, and even the opposition said merely divesting him of portfolios was not enough, and he should be disqualified with immediate effect.The court of additional chief judicial magistrate Rupali C Narwadiya in Nashik rejected Kokate's application citing medical grounds to seek four days to surrender and issued the arrest warrants.",Kokate has been sentenced to two years of rigorous imprisonment for securing two flats in 1995 under the state's 10 per cent economically weaker sections (ews) quota by understating their income.

Krishna contended that the investigation contained serious loopholes that resulted in a clean chit to Siddaramaiah, Parvati, her brother Mallikarjuna Swamy, and the original landowner, Devaraju.In his complaint to the court last year, Krishna accused Siddaramaiah and his family of profiting by Rs 56 crore. In 2021, Siddaramaiah's wife received 14 housing sites from Muda in exchange for 3.16 acres of land acquired by Muda. The land was gifted to Parvati by her brother in 2010.After the special court directed a probe, Siddaramaiah's family returned the sites to Muda. Krishna told TOI, ""The special judge, Santosh Gajanana Bhat, has directed the Lokayukta police to submit their report by Dec 23.

Digital and determined: Uttarakhand's Gen-Z pradhans shatter stereotypes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/digital-and-determined-ukhands-gen-z-pradhans-shatter-stereotypes/articleshow/126067133.cms,"Real change starts at your doorstep, says a GenZ pradhan

DEHRADUN: In the hills of Uttarakhand, with outmigration that has long hollowed out many of its villages, a political shift is taking root with a new cadre of Gen Z pradhans - many of them women, and barely out of college. Armed with degrees and smartphones, they are stepping into local governance with a determination to rebuild the places they call home.When Uttarakhand's latest panchayat results came out at the end of July, many young women entered seats long held by older generations as first-timers. Few months in, they are now challenging two long-standing Himalayan realities: migration and patriarchy. And they are doing so while shattering the stereotype of the pradhan-pati (village head's husband) model that dominates grassroots politics. For these 20-year-somethings, entering the panchayat is not a ticket to fame or wealth, but a conscious choice to ""return home"". And the mandate they've taken on is ambitious: fixing schools, strengthening healthcare, improving roads, and above all, slowing the steady flow of young people who leave the state in search of opportunity.At 22, Sakshi Rawat could have been working in a lab in Dehradun. Instead, three months after completing her biotechnology degree, she chose to return to her village, Kui, in Pauri Garhwal.This, even as her friends chased private jobs in cities. ""Most youngsters leave their villages after studying,"" Sakshi said. ""I want them to stay, to build something of their own here."" The decision to contest was entirely her own. Inspired by young grassroots innovators like Pawan Bisht of nearby village Maroda, who returned to the hills to pursue advanced farming, Sakshi believes Uttarakhand's revival will be youth-led. ""Our biggest challenge isn't geography or funds but mindset. People still think success lies outside the village. Real change will come when results at home become visible,"" she said.In Chamoli's Sarkot village, 21-year-old Priyanka Negi once wanted to be a mathematician. But her father, himself a two-time village head, saw the spark early and began taking her to block meetings. ""I was always drawn to numbers,"" she said, ""but during my graduation, I realised governance is the real math...."" Her priorities are clear. ""Road connectivity... Fix the roads, and half the problems of rural, hill life resolve themselves. ""For 22-year-old Deeksha Mandoli, leadership came early, as did motherhood. Married at 20 and a mother by 21, she is now the pradhan of Gulari village, Chamoli. An English graduate, she believes addiction among youth is an emerging issue. Deeksha rejects the old ""pradhan-pati"" dynamic with calmness. ""People now talk to us directly..."" In Chari, a Chamoli village with 250 voters, Kiran Negi has taken the new pradhan charge. Kiran, the youngest pradhan from her block, said ""This village is tiny, but problems aren't. Roads, water... Everything needs work."" The absence of a male figure by her side, has made her decisions more visible, Kiran said, challenging the old idea that ambition lives only in cities.","In the hills of uttarakhand, a political shift is taking root with a new cadre of gen z pradhans.

The minister said 40% of PM2.5 pollution in Delhi is caused by vehicles.Asked about how the issue is tackled globally, Yadav said the govt has carried out a comparative study of measures taken by different cities, such as London, to improve air quality. ""Different countries have taken different measures. We are fully sensitive to this problem and are working on science-based solutions.""""Cities across the world that have reduced pollution have improved fuel quality.We moved from BS-IV to BS-VI. Old vehicles should have been phased out, but they were granted a stay against coercive action in Aug. That stay was withdrawn yesterday (Wednesday),"" Yadav said.He was referring to Supreme Court modifying its Aug order, which had barred coercive action against diesel vehicles older than 10 years and petrol vehicles older than 15 years in the National Capital Region (NCR), and clarifying that action can be taken against vehicles that do not meet BS-IV emission standards. Responding to a question, the minister regretted that Lok Sabha could not take up a discussion on air pollution on Thursday, saying it was due to the ""ruckus created by Congress members"" in the House. ""They (opposition members) stood on chairs and tore documents. It was total chaos,"" Yadav said.The minister also appealed to people to cooperate through their voluntary actions in the fight against air pollution.",Union environment minister bhupender yadav said the govt was taking multiple measures to deal with the problem of air pollution.

SC upholds man's will cutting off daughter for marrying 'outsider',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-upholds-mans-will-cutting-off-daughter-for-marrying-outsider/articleshow/126064884.cms,"Says Testator’s Wish Assumes Pre-Eminence

NEW DELHI: The string of landmark judgments on gender equality could not help Shyla Joseph get an equitable 1/9th share of the property of her father N S Sreedharan, who had nine children but in his will disinherited her for marrying outside the community.A Supreme Court bench of Justices Ahsanuddin Amanullah and K Vinod Chandran reversed the concurrent findings of the HC and the trial court which had doubted the will and allowed equitable partition of Sreedharan's property among the nine children, including Shyla.Writing the judgment, Justice Chandran said, ""There can be no interference to the will which stands proved unequivocally. The judgment and decree of the high court and that of the trial court stands set aside. The plaintiff (Shyla) is found to have no claim over the properties of her father, which by a will have been bequeathed to the other siblings of the plaintiff.""Once the SC doubted the claim, senior advocate P B Krishnan, appearing for Shyla, requested the bench that her entitlement at best was just 1/9th share of her father's assets which is a negligible portion of the properties.The bench said the question of equality does not arise in a case relating to the wish of a man about division and inheritance of his properties.It said, ""We are not on equity, and the wish of the testator assumes pre-eminence. The last will and testament of the testator cannot be digressed from or frustrated."" While allowing the appeal of her siblings, the bench ordered dismissal of the suit she had filed for equitable partition of her father's properties.It said the rule of prudence cannot apply to the contents of a will, which is the wish of the individual who has absolute discretion to divide his properties. If all siblings had been divested of their inheritance through a will, then the rule of prudence could have been applied by the courts, the bench said.Referring to the reason for which Sreedharan had disinherited Shyla, the SC said, ""There is a reason stated for such exclusion, the acceptability of which to our minds, is not what the rule of prudence dictates. We cannot put the testator in our shoes... We cannot substitute our opinions in place of that of the testator; his desire prompted by his own justifications.""",Shyla joseph was disinherited by her father n s sreedharan for marrying outside the community.

It passed the order after both CM and governor consented for the panel. The dispute refused to die as both functionaries again did not come to consensus on selecting two out of nine names suggested by the committee and the court thereafter asked the panel to recommend names on the order of preference.As the matter was called Thursday, attorney general R Venkataramani, appearing for governor, told SC that both functionaries have come to a consensus on who are to be appointed. ""We are happy to record that the chancellor and govt, in one voice, reported that appointment of VC in two universities have been made from empanelled list. We place our gratitude to the office of Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia.
