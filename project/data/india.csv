CHENNAI: A war of words broke out between former chief of BJP's Tamil Nadu unit K Annamalai and functionaries of Sena UBT and MNS over his remarks that Mumbai is an international city and does not belong to Maharashtra alone. Annamalai made the comment while campaigning for BMC polls in Mumbai last week.At a joint rally of Sena UBT and MNS in Mumbai on Monday, MNS chief Raj Thackeray mocked Annamalai, calling him ""rasmalai"" and invoked the slogan ""hatao lungi, bajao pungi"", a phrase derogatorily used to target south Indians in Mumbai.Annamalai hit back: ""Some wrote that they would cut my legs if I visit Mumbai.

Accenture techie murdered in Bengaluru: Student plotted killing after she resisted his advances; flat set ablaze to mask crime,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/neighbour-student-held-for-murder-of-techie-in-bengaluru-flat-torched-to-destroy-evidence/articleshow/126469068.cms,"





BENGALURU: What was first believed to be a tragic death in a house fire has now been uncovered as a brutal murder.A second-year pre-university student has been arrested for the killing of a 34-year-old software engineer in east Bengaluru earlier this month. Police said the accused allegedly smothered the woman after she resisted his advances and then set fire to her flat in a calculated attempt to erase evidence.The victim, Sharmila Kushalappa, a native of Mangaluru, worked with Accenture and lived alone in a rented flat in Subramanya Layout, Ramamurthynagar. On the night of Jan 3, she was found unconscious inside her locked two-bedroom apartment after a fire broke out. She was later declared dead, with initial suspicion pointing to smoke inhalation — a theory that investigators would soon prove wrong.The accused, Karnal Kurai K, a IInd-year PU student at a private college and from Arasunagar in Virajpet town of Kodagu district, lived with his mother in the same building, next door to Sharmila's flat on the second floor. He has been arrested and remanded to three days of police custody.According to police, the case took a decisive turn after forensic and postmortem findings contradicted the initial assumption that Sharmila had died due to smoke inhalation. Ramamurthynagar police had received a complaint from Sharmila's friend, K Rohit, who suspected foul play after learning of her death.On the night of the incident, at 10.30pm, the building owner alerted the fire department after noticing smoke coming from Sharmila's flat. Fire personnel broke open the locked door and doused the flames. Sharmila was found lying motionless near the kitchen and was rushed to hospital, where doctors declared her brought dead.Investigators said injuries on her hands and visible signs of a struggle at the scene raised doubts. During autopsy, doctors found that the injuries were inflicted prior to the fire and were inconsistent with accidental burns. Medical opinion indicated that Sharmila had been smothered just before she lost consciousness.Based on this, police narrowed their probe and detained Karnal for questioning. He reportedly confessed to the crime. A police officer said Karnal entered Sharmila's flat through a sliding window at 9pm. When confronted, he expressed his desire towards her, which she resisted, shouting at him to leave. Enraged by the rejection, he allegedly held her mouth and nose shut, causing her to lose consciousness.Police said bloodstains from her mouth and nose were found on her clothes. To destroy this evidence, the accused allegedly removed the clothes and set them on fire before escaping through the same window. The fire later spread to other parts of the flat.","Karnal kurai k, a second-year pre-university student, has been arrested for the killing of a 34-year-old software engineer in east bengaluru.

Between the numbers

The evolving battle

Late-night meetings in Delhi rarely make for calm politics, and the one that unfolded late evening last week between Union home minister Amit Shah and AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami, or EPS, was no exception.In optics, it was another routine round of(alliance) discussions ahead of the 2026 Tamil Nadu Assembly elections. In substance, it revealed how the push for(control) was unsettling the alliance, exposing the deepest fault lines yet in the National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) attempt to present a credible, unified challenge to the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam ( DMK ) government led by chief minister MK Stalin.At the heart of the tension lies a demand that goes beyond the usual arithmetic of seat-sharing. The BJP reportedly wants a formal power-sharing assurance from the AIADMK, including at least three cabinet berths if an AIADMK-led NDA were to form the next government.For Tamil Nadu’s political culture, shaped by decades of Dravidian assertion and a strong emphasis on regional autonomy, such an explicit pre-election claim has few precedents.The reaction within the AIADMK has been wary, if not outright resistant, as the BJP’s clout in the South remains lean.The pre-poll power-sharing deal, however, is only one strand in a much larger and more byzantine political development. With just months to go before the 2026 polls, Tamil Nadu’s political field is unusually crowded and unsettled.The NDA is trying to stitch together a fragmented anti-DMK vote; the DMK is defending its record amid murmurs of alliance unease with the Congress, while actor-turned-politician Vijay has injected a new variable through his fledgling but closely watched Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK). The result is a state on the cusp of a multi-cornered contest, where perception may matter as much as numbers.For the BJP, Tamil Nadu remains the most challenging large state on the electoral map. Despite steady organisational work over the past decade and a growing vote share, the party has not yet translated presence into power.Its alliance with the AIADMK has therefore always been more than tactical and is seen in Delhi as the primary vehicle for relevance in the southern state. However, the current BJP strategy, curated mainly by Amit Shah, reflects this urgency.BJP has consistently maintained that merely contesting a limited number of seats as a junior partner no longer serves the long-term interests of the party. The proposal that the BJP and its own allies together contest around 56 of the state’s 234 assembly seats is part of this thinking.More striking, however, is the reported insistence on cabinet representation, a move intended to signal to cadres and voters alike that the BJP is not just supporting an AIADMK government but would be a stakeholder in governance.This push has coincided with a renewed effort by Shah and the central leadership to rebuild a broader NDA in the state. Former allies and breakaway factions are being courted again, including leaders who left the alliance last year. The BJP believes that consolidating these forces is essential to prevent vote-splitting that could once again hand the DMK an advantage.Yet, this centralised approach has also revived old anxieties. In Tamil Nadu, where electoral narratives are often framed around resistance to “Delhi control”, any perception that the BJP is dictating terms risks becoming a political liability rather than an asset for the AIADMK.For the AIADMK, the alliance question is as much about survival as it is about strategy. Since the death of J Jayalalithaa, oras she was popularly known, the party has struggled to regain the dominance it once enjoyed.In the 2016 elections, the AIADMK under Jayalalithaa had emerged victorious with 136 seats.The AIADMK-led alliance, in the 2021 state polls, which were fought in the absence of, won 75 seats, of which the AIADMK itself secured 66, while the DMK-led front swept to power with 159 seats. The verdict underlined both the AIADMK’s residual strength and the scale of the challenge ahead.After the 2021 assembly defeat, EPS moved decisively to consolidate control over the AIADMK, marginalising rivals and asserting himself as the party’s sole authority. This process effectively pushed out O Panneerselvam (OPS), once a key face of the party and a former chief minister. The EPS–OPS split was not just a leadership clash but a symptom of the AIADMK’s post-Jayalalithaa identity crisis.Palaniswami argued that a single centre of authority was essential for electoral recovery, while Panneerselvam continued to claim legitimacy through loyalty to Jayalalithaa’s legacy and sympathy among sections of the cadre. EPS emerged stronger within the party, but the split narrowed the AIADMK’s social and political reach at a time when it could least afford division.For the BJP, this internal fracture has been an enduring source of discomfort. The party has viewed Panneerselvam as more approachable and politically expendable, someone who could be accommodated without threatening the alliance’s structure. Palaniswami, by contrast, has been guarded and transactional, keen to keep both the BJP and expelled leaders at arm’s length to protect his authority and the party’s regional identity.This has left the BJP caught between competing compulsions: it cannot ignore EPS without risking the alliance, but it also hesitates to shut the door on OPS, whose limited yet specific influence could matter in a tight contest. The result has been an uneasy balancing act, one that reflects the BJP’s broader struggle to manage Tamil Nadu politics without appearing overbearing.Against this backdrop, Palaniswami’s reluctance to commit publicly to power-sharing with the BJP is rooted in political instinct.The AIADMK is also cautious about re-inducting expelled leaders and rival factions like the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK).The AMMK did not win seats but polled enough votes in several regions to dent the AIADMK’s prospects, particularly in the southern and delta districts.This residual vote base, drawn mainly from sections of the Thevar community and AIADMK loyalists disillusioned with the current leadership, makes the AMMK less a kingmaker and more a potential spoiler. For the BJP, bringing Dhinakaran back into the NDA is about preventing further fragmentation of the anti-DMK vote rather than expecting direct seat gains.While the BJP sees figures like O Panneerselvam and TTV Dhinakaran’s AMMK as assets who can consolidate specific caste and regional vote banks, Palaniswami views their return as a threat to internal cohesion and his own authority.The re-entry of the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) into the NDA has given the alliance a symbolic boost, but not without complications. Anbumani Ramadoss’s decision to align with the AIADMK-BJP front was meant to strengthen the NDA’s presence in northern Tamil Nadu, where the PMK traditionally draws support from the Vanniyar community. Though this adds social breadth to the coalition at a time when consolidation is critical, the PMK is far from united.The sharp and public rift between Anbumani and his father, party founder S Ramadoss, has fractured the cadre and weakened the party’s ability to transfer votes as a bloc. Rival claims over leadership and legitimacy have created confusion at the grassroots, blunting what was once the PMK’s core electoral strength.For the NDA, the PMK’s return improves optics but not certainty. Without internal cohesion, the party risks becoming an unreliable ally rather than a decisive force against the DMK in 2026.For the DMK, the turbulence within the NDA offers both opportunity and warning. The party’s sweeping victory in 2021, when it returned to power after a decade in opposition, was built on a broad coalition that included the Congress and several regional players.Since then, the government has focused on welfare schemes, social justice narratives, Tamil identity and language. However, incumbency carries its own risks. There are murmurs of unease within the DMK-led alliance, particularly the Congress seeking greater seat shares or a more visible role post the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.While these strains are far from a rupture, they are being closely watched by rivals eager to exploit any cracks. The DMK leadership, which is slowly transitioning from MK Stalin to Udhayanidhi Stalin , is also conscious that a fragmented opposition could paradoxically complicate its task.A three- or four-cornered contest may lower the winning threshold in individual constituencies, but it also introduces unpredictability. The party’s messaging has therefore doubled down on stability, contrasting its governance record with what it portrays as an unstable and opportunistic opposition camp.Perhaps the most intriguing element in the current churn is the emergence of Vijay as a political actor. His TVK has yet to contest a major election, but its entry has already altered calculations across the spectrum.Vijay’s appeal cuts across age groups, with particular resonance among younger voters and sections disillusioned with established parties.His carefully calibrated stance, critical of both the BJP and the DMK, positions the TVK as an alternative rather than an adjunct. This has attracted exploratory overtures from leaders sidelined within traditional formations, adding to the sense of flux.At the same time, the TVK’s strengths remain largely potential rather than proven.Organisational depth, booth-level machinery, and the ability to translate popular enthusiasm into votes are tests that only an election can provide. For now, Vijay’s presence serves as a wildcard, expectedly capable of influencing outcomes even if it falls short of forming a government.Tamil Nadu’s recent electoral history offers important context. In 2016, the AIADMK won 136 seats with around 41 per cent of the vote, while the DMK secured 98 seats with just under 40 per cent. The narrow margin reflected how small shifts in alliances and turnout can have outsized effects.Five years later, in 2021, the pendulum swung decisively. The DMK-led alliance polled close to 46 per cent and won 159 seats, while the AIADMK alliance’s vote share dipped to around 39 per cent, translating into 75 seats. The BJP, contesting as an ally, won four seats and improved its vote share, but remained dependent on the larger Dravidian partner.These figures highlight two enduring truths. First, alliances matter enormously in Tamil Nadu’s first-past-the-post system. Second, no single party, outside of peak DMK or AIADMK waves, can easily dominate without a broad coalition.As the state heads towards the 2026 elections, the political picture remains fluid. The BJP is betting that a reconstituted NDA, bolstered by returning allies and clearer power-sharing signals, can present itself as a viable alternative.The AIADMK is trying to balance that partnership with its need to project independence and reassure its core electorate. The DMK is defending its turf while watching for signs of opposition consolidation. And Vijay’s TVK is carving out space in a crowded field, its final impact yet to be measured.What is clear is that Tamil Nadu’s politics is entering a phase where old certainties no longer apply automatically. The familiar binary of DMK versus AIADMK is giving way to a more layered contest, shaped by national ambitions, regional identities, and the aspirations of a new generation of voters.Whether the NDA’s current troubles are a prelude to a stronger, more coherent front, or a symptom of deeper contradictions, will become evident only as alliances crystallise and campaigns take shape. For now, the state watches as negotiations continue behind closed doors, aware that in Tamil Nadu, the path to power is rarely straightforward and often decided as much by perception as by pact.",Aiadmk and bjp announced alliance for tamil nadu's 2026 polls.

BMC Becomes Mega Battleground As Thackerays Reunite And Alliances Shift Ahead Of Civic Wars 2026

MUMBAI: In a setback to the Mahayuti government, which was planning to transfer a double instalment of Rs 3,000 under its Ladki Bahin scheme to underprivileged women by Jan 14 - shortly before the Jan 15 elections to 29 municipal corporations, including BMC - state election commissioner Dinesh Waghmare has barred the advance payment for the month of Jan while allowing the pending payment for Dec 2025.Hence, the state will only be allowed to dispense the sum of Rs 1,500 for Dec to around 2.5 crore eligible women in the state by Jan 14.""The regular benefits of the scheme can be given while the model code of conduct is in force. But benefits cannot be given in advance. And new beneficiaries are also not allowed to be selected,"" Waghmare said in his order.In doing so, Waghmare went beyond the report of state chief secretary Rajesh Aggarwal which had only said that ""development work and schemes that were actually started before the announcement of the elections are allowed to continue during the code of conduct period.""In a post on X on Jan 7, rural development minister Girish Mahajan of BJP said that eligible beneficiaries of the Ladki Bahin scheme will receive a combined transfer of Rs 3,000 for Dec and Jan in their bank accounts before Makar Sankranti, which falls on Jan 14, terming it a ""special gift"" from chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.The flagship scheme of govt was credited with powering a landslide victory for the Mahayuti in the assembly polls last year.Congress filed a complaint to SEC and questioned the timing of the announcement, alleging it was a violation of the model code of conduct and aimed at influencing voters ahead of the corporation elections. SEC in turn had asked the chief secretary to send a report on the issue. Waghmare's order came after the report was sent.Meanwhile, on the issue of around 70 of 2,869 posts in the state's municipal corporations set for unopposed elections in favour of Mahayuti candidates, Waghmaresaid that the count was just 2.4% of the total seats.""This cannot be considered a threat to democracy. In fact, in the Lok Sabha elections last year, around 50 MPs were elected unopposed,"" said a senior official.Asked if Fadnavis' statement that Mumbai would have a Marathi and Hindu mayor was a violation of the model code of conduct, Waghmare said, ""If someone sends a complaint to SEC, we will issue notice on the statement.""","The flagship scheme was credited with powering a landslide victory for mahayuti in the 2025 assembly polls that brought back fadnavis as cm.

Hinduism vs Hindutva: TMC MP Mahua Moitra’s 'Love Jihad' Remark Ignites Fierce Political Debate

RAIPUR: The headmistress of a govt school in Chhattisgarh has been suspended while a contractual assistant teacher faces dismissal after a Class 4 English exam paper listed 'Ram' as a possible answer to a multiple-choice question about the name of a protagonist's dog, reports Partha Behera. The paper-setter said the error occurred as a result of inadvertently dropping the last letter of 'Ramu'.The school education department announced the decision on Saturday, four days after the question paper sparked protests across state by VHP, Bajrang Dal and other organisations.

Nabin ascension is seen as a move towards overhaul of BJP

NEW DELHI: BJP working president Nitin Nabin is set to take over as full-fledged national president of the party on Jan 20, in the presence of PM Modi and other senior leaders, including chief ministers, national office-bearers, state party presidents and national executive council members, reports Akhilesh Singh. He will replace JP Nadda , one of the longest-serving party presidents.Since his appointment as working president, Nabin has enjoyed the support of the party brass. His ascension, following elections on Jan 20, therefore, is being seen as a formality.With full-throttle endorsement from the saffron fountainhead, RSS, Nitin Nabin (46) will be the youngest party president, and his ascension is seen as a move towards a complete overhaul of the party, with a possible mix of youth and experience. Party sources have indicated that nominations for the president’s election will take place on Jan 19, followed by election the next day.Party sources said that after completing the nomination process, Nabin will be elected national president the next day. He had been appointed BJP working president on Dec 15, but his formal takeover was on hold due to “kharmas”, an inauspicious phase when Hindus avoid taking up new work or marking a beginning.Since his appointment, Nabin has been meeting party workers at the BJP headquarters.Widely regarded as an organisational chief, Nabin currently represents Bankipur assembly constituency in Patna district. Nabin is the son of the late BJP politician and former BJP MLA Nabin Kishore Prasad Sinha. With nearly two decades of organisational experience, Nabin has held several key roles within the party, including as Bihar president of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha and BJP’s election in-charge for Chhattisgarh.","Nitin nabin set to take over as full-fledged national president of the party on jan 20.

People say they were not ‘witnesses’, cops say probe will reveal all

BHOPAL: From late-night raids to routine seizures spread across villages miles apart, they were present everywhere - many a time simultaneously at different locations. Allegations of 'omnipresent' police witnesses in Madhya Pradesh's Mauganj district have snowballed into a major controversy after scrutiny of digital crime tracking records confirmed that the same six individuals were repeatedly cited as govt witnesses in hundreds of cases registered at Laur and Naigadhi police stations in the district.The pattern of a few selected names recurring case after case emerged from FIRs accessed through Crime & Criminal Tracking Network & Systems, a home ministry project.At the centre of the allegations is Jagdish Singh Thakur, former in-charge of Naigadhi and Laur police stations, against whom complaints were lodged by an RTI activist, accusing him of misusing his position to register over 150 questionable FIRs. The complaint alleged that under his charge at the two police stations, the same favoured individuals were repeatedly cited witnesses to facilitate routine police action, justify the cases on paper and enable corruption.One of the six individuals, Amit Kushwaha, who was cited as a witness in hundreds of cases, allegedly moved with Thakur during his transfers. The activist, Kunj Bihari Tiwari, first lodged a police complaint in 2022. He filed another detailed complaint in Dec 2025, sharing 'proof'.Acting on the complaint, Mauganj SP Dilip Soni removed Thakur as Naigadhi police station incharge Sunday. “We are getting the complaint probed in detail.The complainant shared details regarding 145 FIRs with common witnesses,” Soni told TOI. He however, added that “this was not the only reason, but one of the reasons for which the action was taken”. Some of the ‘witnesses’ have now distanced themselves from the police’s move.Dinesh Kushwaha, a vegetable vendor, told TOI: “I signed as a witness in only one or two cases where I was present. I wasn’t a witness in so many other cases. Police wrote my name as a witness without my knowledge.” Another witness, Rahul Vishwakarma, said: “I was not present during the action. Iused to sign after the accused were arrested and brought to the police station. But I did not sign as a witness in so many cases. I am a driver. ” Tiwari claimed the rot runs much deeper.“I examined FIRs of more than a year and found around 200 cases with common names. When I scanned the records from the year 2000, I found similar names in about 1,000 FIRs. I am also a victim, as I was framed in a case by the same police officer,” the complainant alleged. TOIaccessed and examined copies of over 40 such FIRs and found the same names repeatedly listed as witnesses across unrelated cases. Police officers said the probe will determine whether legal procedures and norms were violated and whether disciplinary or criminal action was required.","The pattern of a few selected names recurring case after case emerged from firs accessed through crime & criminal tracking network & systems, a home ministry project.

"'Will come to Mumbai, try cutting my legs': BJP’s Annamalai fires back at Raj Thackeray; slams ‘rasmalai’ jibe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-come-to-mumbai-try-cutting-my-legs-bjps-annamalai-fires-back-at-raj-thackeray-slams-rasmalai-jibe/articleshow/126479823.cms,"'Will Come to Mumbai, Try Cutting My Legs: Annamalai Hits Back at Raj Thackeray

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP )leader K Annamalai on Monday launched a broadside against Raj Thackeray and dared the MNS chief to stop him from entering Mumbai.The reaction came a day after Thackeray mockingly referred to the BJP leader as “rasmalai” and questioned his standing to speak on issues related to Mumbai.At a press conference in Chennai, the BJP leader alleged that he has received multiple threats, with some people even threatening to cut off his legs.“Who are Aaditya Thackeray and Raj Thackeray to threaten me? I am proud to be a farmer’s son. They have organised meetings just to abuse me. I don’t know whether I have become that important,” Annamalai said.“Some have written that they will cut my legs if I come to Mumbai. I will come to Mumbai—try cutting my legs. If I were afraid of such threats, I would have stayed in my village. If I say Kamaraj is one of India’s greatest leaders, does it mean he is no longer a Tamil? If I say Mumbai is a world-class city, does it mean Maharashtrians didn’t build it? These people are just ignorant,” former Tamil Nadu BJP chief added.Earlier on Sunday, Thackeray attacked Annamalai for suggesting that Mumbai is an “international city”.Thackeray also referred to his uncle Bal Thackeray's slogan from the 1960s and 1970s — “Hatao lungi, bajao pungi.”“One rasmalai came from Tamil Nadu… what is your connection to here? Hatao lungi, bajao pungi,” Thackeray said at a joint UBT–MNS rally in Mumbai.Additionally, Thackeray also said that he would “kick” people from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh out of Maharashtra if they “try to impose Hindi”.“People from UP and Bihar should understand that Hindi is not your language. I don’t hate the language… but if you try to impose it, I’ll kick you. They’re coming from all sides to Maharashtra and snatching away your share. If land and language are gone, you will be finished,” Raj Thackeray was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray and his cousin Raj Thackeray also mounted a joint attack on the rival BJP over what they described as “fake Hindutva”, saying their political reunion was prompted by an imminent “danger” to Mumbai.Uddhav said he and Raj Thackeray had set aside their differences in the interest of the Marathi manoos, Hindus, and Maharashtra. Appealing to the core Marathi vote bank, Raj said the two leaders had come together as Mumbai was facing danger.Calling the BMC polls the “last election for the Marathi man”, Thackeray said: “If you miss this opportunity today, you will be finished. Unite for Marathi and Maharashtra.”The State Election Commission in Maharashtra has announced elections to 29 municipal corporations across the state, including the Pune Municipal Corporation, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, and the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation. Polling will be held on January 15, with counting scheduled for January 16.","'will come to mumbai, try cutting my legs': annamalai hits back at raj thackeray.

Wife’s qualification no ground to deny maintenance: HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wifes-qualification-no-ground-to-deny-maintenance-hc/articleshow/126494553.cms,".

PRAYAGRAJ: A wife cannot be denied maintenance under Section 125 of CrPC merely because she is highly qualified or possesses vocational skills, Allahabad HC has ruled, setting aside a Bulandshahr family court’s order. In its Jan 8 order, a bench of Justice Garima Prashad said it was misplaced for a husband to rely solely on his wife’s qualifications to evade his legal obligation to maintain her.The bench observed that a wife’s statutory right to maintenance cannot be infringed by claiming she has the capacity to earn, noting that mere potential to earn is distinct from actual gainful employment. The court said it is difficult for a woman to rejoin the workforce after years of domestic and childcare duties. The hard reality is that women are expected to fulfill these obligations, often at the cost of their education or career. But when marital discord arises, the very “sacrifice” is often portrayed as a ploy to extract money from the husband, HC said.“Such sweeping assumptions are not only unfair, but deeply insensitive to the social and emotional realities that women face,” HC added. The high court remanded the matter to the family court, directing it to determine maintenance for the petitioner wife and son on the basis of the husband’s gross income and the principles of social justice embedded in Section 125 CrPC, within a month.The additional principal judge of Bulandshahr court had rejected the wife’s application on the grounds that she concealed her professional education, was living separately without sufficient cause, and refused to return to her matrimonial home despite proceedings under Section 9 of Hindu Marriage Act.","Allahabad hc sets aside a bulandshahr family court’s order.

SC blocks reinstatement of 'peeing' judge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-blocks-reinstatement-of-peeing-judge/articleshow/126494541.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Terming the actions of a Madhya Pradesh judicial officer who created a ruckus inside a train and allegedly urinated on the seat of a female co-passenger as disgusting and grossest misconduct, Supreme Court on Monday blocked the way for his reinstatement in the service. It stayed a MP HC order which had set aside his termination and directed his reinduction.Interestingly, it is MP HC administration which has approached SC challenging the order passed by its judicial side. Acting on the recommendation of the administrative committee and its full court reference, HC administration had terminated his job but he challenged it on the judicial side and a division bench set aside the termination order.""This is a shocking case. You urinated in the compartment. There was a lady... It is disgusting,"" a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said. It expressed surprise on how can HC pass the order in favour of a judicial officer after his disgusting behaviour in public.HC, in his petition filed by advocate Divyakant Lahoti, said that the judicial officer ""indulged in an extremely indecent conduct by urinating on the seat of a female co-passenger, exposing his private parts which is unbecoming of a judge"".It said that HC erred in reinstating him on the basis that he was acquitted in a criminal case lodged against him after the incident.""The reasoning adopted by HC, if allowed to stand, sets a damaging precedent whereby judicial officers proven guilty of misconduct in duly conducted departmental inquires may evade accountability by relying on technical criminal acquittals. Such an approach erodes the autonomy of disciplinary mechanisms, weakens institutional discipline, and risks undermining the very confidence that the public reposes in the judiciary. The preservation of judicial integrity demands that departmental findings, reached through a fair process and on the standard of preponderance of probabilities, be accorded their due weight, or the credibility of the institution itself would be in great peril,"" the petition said.The incident happened when the judge was travelling in an overnight express in June 2018 & was allegedly drunk. He had misbehaved and harassed co-passengers & indulged in obscene actions. He was arrested and was immediately released on bail. He was also acquitted in criminal case lodged against him after witnesses including TTE & victim passengers turned hostile.tnn","A madhya pradesh judicial officer created a ruckus inside a train and allegedly urinated on the seat of a female co-passenger.

NEW DELHI: While sympathising with a young man from UP who will lose his govt job because of its adverse order over his not declaring a pending criminal case against him at the time of recruitment, Supreme Court on Monday emphasised that sympathy cannot supplant the law as such disclosure is not a simple procedural formality but a basic requirement for public service.""There is a maxim in law to the effect that ' dura lex, sed lex', which means the law may be harsh, but the law is law,"" a bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and N K Singh said while quashing the order of Allahabad HC which had held that the non-disclosure was of ""trivial nature"" and his appointment could not be set aside on that ground.""It is also a settled position in law that sympathy cannot supplant law. As such, while we acknowledge that loss of a govt job is not an easy loss to come to terms with, at the same time awareness of consequences is a necessary component of actions,"" the bench said.""Proper and complete disclosure in applications for govt employment is not a simple procedural formality, but a basic requirement rooted in fairness, integrity and public trust. Govt posts attract hundreds, and often thousands, of applicants for a single vacancy, each competing under the same stated conditions; scrupulous vetting of every candidate becomes imperative and essential to ensure a level playing field and to protect the credibility of the selection process.When an applicant withholds information about criminal antecedents, it undermines this process by depriving the appointing authority of the opportunity to make a fully informed assessment of suitability,"" the bench said.While the law recognises that non-disclosure, depending on the nature of the offence and accompanying circumstances, may not invariably be fatal to a candidature, it nevertheless remains a serious lapse. ""The gravity is significantly compounded when the non-disclosure is repeated, as it ceases to be accidental or inadvertent and instead reflects deliberate concealment. Such strikes at the core of trust reposed in candidates for public service, where honesty and transparency are indispensable attributes, and justify a far stricter view by the authorities,"" it said.In the case before it, the person was appointed as Sahayak Samiksha Adhikari, but his services were terminated after it was found there were two pending criminal cases against him, which were not disclosed by him in the form. He approached Allahabad HC, whose single as well as division bench quashed his termination, following which state govt moved SC.",A young man from up will lose his govt job because of its adverse order over his not declaring a pending criminal case against him at the time of recruitment.

‘Attack On My Life’: Suvendu Adhikari Targets Mamata Banerjee, Levels Serious Allegation

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday asked Election Commission to respond within a week to TMC MP Dola Sen's plea accusing the poll panel of arbitrarily deleting more than 58 lakh names from West Bengal's draft voters' list by refusing to accept valid and permissible documents from people during the SIR exercise.Appearing for Sen, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said, ""What is this happening? EC is sending instructions to various election officers through WhatsApp messages or through video conferencing. This is impermissible as all such instructions must be in writing to ensure transparency in the process of preparation of voters' list.""A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi asked EC counsel Eklavya Dwivedi to respond to Sen's petition by Saturday, and posted the matter for Jan 19.Sen has sought extension of Jan 15 deadline for submission of claims and objections to draft voters' list. Calling EC 'WhatsApp commission"" for issuing instructions to election officers through the messaging platform and not through written orders, the MP said EC must be directed to accept permanent residence certificates, panchayat residence certificates and family registers as valid documents for inclusion in voters' list.The draft electoral roll for Bengal was published on Dec 16, and 58,20,898 names were deleted, which the Rajya Sabha MP alleged was without any notice or personal hearing. She said there has been a precipitous decline from 7,66,37,529 voters after the Special Summary Revision of 2025 to 7,08,16,616 voters on the draft electoral roll.She said contrary to the SOP for SIR, in several assembly constituencies, deletion decisions with respect to voters categorised as absentee, shifted, dead and duplicate (ASDD) are being processed centrally and marked en masse as 'Disposed - Form 7' on the Electoral Registration Officer Net Portal. ""Alarmingly, this appears to be occurring without physical verification, individual hearing or meaningful involvement of the EROs concerned,"" she alleged.Sen said, ""A majority of affected electors are women voters, whose surnames have changed post-marriage, leading to misclassification by algorithm used by EC; over 90% of the cases are mismatch in names attributable largely to failure of algorithm; minorities are largely affected by misclassification of algorithm.""As the final roll, scheduled to be published on Feb 14 (after closure of notice and hearing phase on Feb 7), Sen apprehended that the Bengal assembly elections will be immediately declared thereafter, and requested SC to direct EC to correct its voters' list revision process and attempt to include all eligible voters.","Supreme court asks election commission to respond within a week to tmc mp dola sen's plea.
