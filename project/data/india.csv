KALYAN/NAVI MUMBAI: In back-to-back incidents highlighting tensions over the Marathi versus non-Marathi divide in the state, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) workers in Kalyan assaulted an idli vendor over alleged derogatory remarks about Marathi-speaking people, while a video from a local train showed two women locked in a heated argument over the language.The Kalyan incident took place on Friday outside the Royal Star Idliwala eatery.

Rahul Gandhi’s ‘vote theft’ charge: Sharad Pawar claims offer of 160 ‘guaranteed’ seats before Maharashtra polls; Fadnavis questions timing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vote-theft-row-after-rahul-gandhis-charge-sharad-pawar-says-he-was-offered-160-guaranteed-seats-before-maharashtra-polls/articleshow/123205951.cms,"Rahul Gandhi Releases New Video, Claims More 'Proof' On EC, BJP Collusion in Voter List Fraud

NEW DELHI: Amid Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s “vote theft” accusations, NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday claimed that two individuals approached him before the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly elections, offering to secure victory in 160 of the 288 seats.Meanwhile, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis questioned the timing of the disclosure, linking it to Rahul Gandhi’s recent allegations against the Election Commission (EC) and the BJP.“I remember that before the Maharashtra Assembly elections were announced, two people came to meet me in Delhi... They told me that out of 288 seats in Maharashtra, we guarantee you 160 seats. I was surprised, to be honest, I had no doubts about the Election Commission,” Pawar told reporters in Nagpur.Pawar said he later introduced the individuals to Rahul Gandhi. “Whatever they wanted to say, they said in front of Rahul Gandhi. But Rahul Gandhi and I were of the opinion that we should not pay attention to this; this is not our path,” he added.Fadnavis questioned why Pawar made the revelation now, suggesting it supported Rahul Gandhi’s narrative. “Why is Pawar disclosing this after Rahul Gandhi's claims? Earlier Pawar never endorsed Gandhi's claims about (manipulation of) EVMs.No matter what, free and fair polls are held in India... Rahul Gandhi tells stories that sound like a Salim-Javed script, and what Pawar has said seems to be the same script,” he said.The chief minister also criticised Rahul Gandhi for not filing an affidavit as demanded by the EC to substantiate his claims of “huge criminal fraud” in the polls. “Why doesn't Gandhi give a declaration in a quasi-judicial matter?....because he is lying, and if caught, he will be liable to face criminal proceedings,” Fadnavis said.On August 7, Rahul Gandhi alleged that the 2024 Lok Sabha elections were “choreographed” by the EC to favour the BJP, pointing to Maharashtra and Karnataka as examples of voter roll irregularities and sudden spikes in turnout. “In Maharashtra and Haryana, we saw it right in front of our faces… More voters were added in five months than in five years in Maharashtra… Huge jump in voter turnout after 5 pm,” he said.Rahul claimed some constituencies recorded new voter additions exceeding the population of Maharashtra and accused the EC of refusing to share voter lists or CCTV footage. The Maharashtra chief electoral officer has since asked him to provide an affidavit and evidence of illegal voter inclusion or deletion.The 2024 Maharashtra Assembly elections saw the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance win 235 seats, including 132 for the BJP, 57 for the Shiv Sena, and 41 for the NCP (Ajit Pawar faction). The Maha Vikas Aghadi was reduced to 20 seats for Shiv Sena (UBT), 16 for Congress, and 10 for the NCP (Sharad Pawar faction).","Ncp (sp) chief sharad pawar claims two individuals approached him before the 2024 maharashtra assembly elections.

In response to an RTI query, National Medical Commission (NMC) stated that of the 11,200 applications for registration received, 91% have not been approved as of Aug 8.Launched with much fanfare by Union health minister on Aug 23, 2024, the NMR portal of NMC for registration of all MBBS doctors eligible to practise in India has failed to take off. NMR was hailed as a move to ""strengthen the digital healthcare ecosystem"", after which similar registers were to be launched for paramedics and other healthcare professionals. Yet, with the register for doctors - who constitute the smallest professional group in the health system - not materialising, it remains to be seen whether the registers for an estimated 35 lakh nurses and for paramedics, who would be more than double the number of nurses, will happen any time soon.In response to a question in Parliament, the health ministry said that 13.9 lakh MBBS doctors are registered with state councils, of which it is assumed that about 80% (over 11 lakh) are available.NMC had issued the Registration of Medical Practitioners and Licence to Practice Medicine Regulations, 2023, on June 8, 2023. According to the regulation, NMC's Ethics & Medical Registration Board shall maintain the NMR, which shall contain entries of all doctors in all state registers maintained by state medical councils. The regulations envisage a unique identification number for every doctor, centrally generated by EMRB, which will ""grant registration in NMR and eligibility to practice medicine in India"".All existing medical practitioners enrolled in the Indian Medical Register or the State Medical Register not having registration number as per the regulation were mandated to update their registration in the web portal of EMRB within three months of publication of the regulation.However, applications have petered out as approvals for 90% of those who applied are still pending. From 6,000 applications in the first three months after launch, applications have dwindled to less than 800 in past four months.The renewal of registration every five years is supposed to happen through state councils and the status of registration in the state registry ""shall automatically reflected (sic) in the National Register"". However, state registries are yet to be linked to NMR.""Even when state councils confirm the membership of a doctor, NMC is rejecting it, as in my case,"" said Dr KV Babu, an ophthalmologist and RTI activist.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal Police on Saturday lathi-charged protesters in central Kolkata as they attempted to breach barricades during the 'Nabanna Chalo Abhiyan,' march to the state secretariat.Meanwhile, the victim's parents alleged manhandling by the state police and claimed attempts were made to stop them from joining the march.The rally marked the first anniversary of the rape and murder of a doctor at RG Kar Medical College Protesters waved the Tricolour, carried banners demanding justice for the RG Kar victim, and shouted slogans for the resignation of chief minister Mamata Banerjee, PTI reported.The mother of the RG Kar victim alleged that the she was roughed up by Bengal police personnel and suffered a head injury while she was on her way to join a march to West Bengal state secretariat 'Nabanna'. The scuffle led to her 'shankha' (traditional conch shell bangle) being broken, she said.""Why are they stopping us like this? All we want is to reach Nabanna and seek justice for my daughter,"" PTI quoted her saying.The victim’s father alleged that police tried to stop the family from joining the march despite court permission for a peaceful rally.""We had to come dodging police at several points to get here,"" the father told reporters, terming the obstruction a violation of their rights.The parents had urged the citizens to join the march accusing the authorities of attempting to silence their demand for justice.Adhikari had also urged BJP workers to join the march without party flags, while declaring that the 'Nabanna Abhijan' was not a political event but a call by the murdered doctor’s parents.Tension gripped as protesters tried to break through police barricades while marching towards Vidyasagar Setu, defying warnings to remain at the Rani Rashmoni Road assembly point.Police, citing a Calcutta High Court order, had earlier designated Santragachi bus stand and Rani Rashmoni Avenue as protest sites.Despite repeated police appeals over loudspeakers to follow the high court’s order, protesters were seen scaling 10-foot barricades, using blunt tools to break through iron walls, and forcing openings to move ahead.Heavy police and RAF deployment, along with water cannons, were positioned at key points to block the march.""The police can fire upon us, but we are determined to reach 'Nabanna', where the state government must answer why justice has not been delivered to Abhaya (RG Kar victim) even after one year,"" a protestor said, the agency added.West Bengal leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari, BJP leader Agnimitra Paul, and several party MLAs staged a sit-in at the Park Street–J L Nehru Road crossing, alleging that over 100 protesters, including themselves and the RG Kar victim’s parents, were injured in the police lathi-charge.""Mamata Banerjee will pay dearly for this. This protest is only going to get bigger from here,"" Adhikari warned, PTI reported.BJP IT chief Amit Malviya claimed that ""West Bengal Police trampled the Indian national flag in Howrah"" during the march. He also shared a video of the incident. The TOI could not independently verify the video.""During Nabanna Abhiyaan, West Bengal Police trampled the Indian national flag in Howrah. The same day, they lathi-charged grieving parents of Dr Abhaya, a state hospital doctor raped and murdered, and attacked patriots carrying the Tiranga. This is Mamata Banerjee’s Bengal. Bengal Police now protect only TMC, not the nation,"" he said in a post on X.Prohibitory orders under Section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita were enforced near Nabanna, with multi-layer barricades at several crossings.Traffic movement on Howrah Bridge and Vidyasagar Setu over the Hooghly River was halted as part of security measures.The incident traces back to the August 9, 2024, killing of a young doctor, whose body was found in a seminar room at RG Kar Hospital in north Kolkata.Former civic volunteer Sanjay Roy was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment until death in January 2025. The CBI, which took over the probe following court orders, maintained Roy as the sole accused.","The rally marked the first anniversary of the rape and murder of a doctor at rg kar medical college.

Sibal said he tried to speak to Dhankhar but there has been no response, and several politicians have shared similar experience with him. ""What should we do? Should we file a habeas corpus?"" he asked.Dhankhar, in his earlier responsibilities as Bengal governor and VP, was very vocal and active in public life but he has not spoken or put anything on social media since his resignation as VP on July 21.Taking a swipe at govt, Sibal said Dhankhar supported govt throughout his tenure but it now seems opposition will have to protect him. On X, he wrote, ""Can we be informed: Where is he? Is he safe? Why is he incommunicado?""Earlier in the day, Sibal said he had heard of the movie 'Laapataa Ladies' but never heard of a ""laapataa vice president"". He also said home ministry would be aware of Dhankhar's whereabouts and Shah should give a statement on where Dhankhar is. ""Is he getting treatment somewhere? People of his family have also not said anything. What is the issue? We had heard of such things only in other countries but India is democratic so such things should be in public domain,"" Sibal said.Meanwhile, sources said govt will soon have to decide on Dhankhar's new home as the VP Enclave would have to be readied for his successor.TOI has learnt so far there has been no communication from govt to housing ministry with regard to Dhankhar's new home.

Justice Pardiwala's anti-quota remark expunged in 2015,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/justice-pardiwalas-anti-quota-remark-expunged-in-2015/articleshow/123210856.cms,"NEW DELHI: The age-old saying that a human being's life moves in a cycle is strangely true for judges of constitutional courts, especially for Justice J B Pardiwala who became a judge of Gujarat HC in Feb 2011 and was fast-tracked to Supreme Court in May 2022.No one other than Justice Pardiwala can better explain the complications that entail when a constitutional court judge sidetracks the issue before him and makes observations not germane to the pleadings before courts of record - SC and HCs.Unfortunately, Justice Pardiwala did not fall back on his own experience while dictating the order on Aug 4 making harsh comments about the competence of an Allahabad HC judge in criminal matters, and worse barring him from touching criminal cases for adjudication for his entire tenure as an HC judge.CJI B R Gavai's intervention and the graciousness of Justices Pardiwala and R Mahadevan to expunge the remarks against the HC judge may have helped salvage the HC judge's stature, but he may have to live with the memory of the odium.Interestingly in Dec 2015, Justice Pardiwala, as a Gujarat HC judge, while refusing to quash sedition charges against Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti convener Hardik Patel, had drifted away from the criminal case before him to make sweeping anti-reservation comments.In his judgment, he had said, ""If I am asked by anyone to name two things, which has destroyed this country or rather, has not allowed the country to progress in the right direction, then the same is - reservation and corruption. It is very shameful for any citizen of this country to ask for reservation after 65 years of independence. When our Constitution was framed, it was understood that reservation would remain for a period of 10 years but unfortunately it has continued even after 65 years of independence. The biggest threat, today, for the country is corruption.""Saying that reservations have caused social divisiveness, Justice Pardiwala had observed, ""The parody of the situation is that India must be the only country wherein some of the citizens crave to be called backward.""This anti-quota remark in a judgment incensed many political leaders and 58 Rajya Sabha MPs moved a notice for initiation of his removal from judgeship. Within a few hours of the motion being filed by the MPs, the Gujarat govt came to Justice Pardiwala's rescue by moving an application requesting the judge to expunge the 'offensive' remarks.Justice Pardiwala acted swiftly and expunged the entire paragraph 62 from his judgment. He directed the HC registry to issue a fresh certified copy of the judgment sans Paragraph 62 which had contained the controversial anti-quota observation.","Justice j b pardiwala was fast-tracked to supreme court in may 2022.

Karra announced that Congress workers would fast in different districts of J&K from Aug 9 to Aug 21 --- when Parliament’s monsoon session concludes.Amid chants of “We want statehood”, Karra pointed out that after the abrogation of Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019, the Narendra Modi govt had repeatedly promised to restore statehood and BJP leaders had publicly reaffirmed their commitment during election campaigns.“No steps have been taken. We feel they are not serious about their promise. This has compelled us to stage protests last month in Srinagar, Jammu, and at Jantar Mantar in Delhi. Now we have started this hunger strike programme,” Karra said.On July 17, Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge wrote to PM Modi to introduce a bill in the ongoing monsoon session to restore J&K’s statehood.Two days later, the party held protests in Kashmir, followed by a demonstration on the first day of the monsoon session in Delhi. The party also observed Aug 5 as a “black day.”K arra urged political forces, irrespective of political ideologies, to join the latest protests. “Every party is appealing for restoration of statehood. What stops them from joining us?” Karra asked in comments seen as an allusion to ally NC.Chief minister and NC vice-president Omar Abdullah had last month voiced displeasure at not being consulted or informed when Congress launched its protests in Delhi. Three days ago, Omar wrote to all national parties, including BJP, to help bring a bill in the Parliament’s current session for statehood restoration.Karra, however, argued that the CM should have directly written to Modi. “I don’t know why he (Omar) preferred parties for the letter rather than the PM.”",J&k congress president tariq hamid karra led the fasts in srinagar coinciding with quit india movement’s anniversary.

Army, paramilitary and J&K police units — backed by drones, helicopters and para commandos — have so far killed at least two terrorists and left about 10 security personnel wounded, according to sources.The deaths took the toll of security personnel killed in operations in J&K this year to 16 — three in Kashmir valley and 13 in Jammu division, including three from Pakistani firing during the standoff following Operation Sindoor.Army’s Srinagar-based Chinar Corps said the two soldiers from Punjab “fell in the line of duty”. “Indian Army expresses deepest condolences and stands in solidarity with the bereaved families,” it posted on X.Pritpal from Manupur village in Khanna district was married Feb 24 and had returned to duty in April. He joined the Army in 2015 after clearing class 12, continuing a family tradition — two of his uncles served in uniform.“We got a call at 5.30am saying he was wounded, and then another an hour later saying he died fighting terrorists,” said his elder brother Harpreet. His father Harbans said Pritpal last told him two days ago he was fine and would come home on leave at month’s end.According to the Army, Pritpal was hit by splinters when a hiding terrorist threw a grenade at him. His body will be flown to Halwara air force station and taken by road to Manupur for cremation with full military honours.Harminder from Mandi Gobindgarh in Fatehgarh Sahib district was the sole breadwinner for his parents and an ailing sister. He joined the Army eight years ago. “He had told me that he would take care of all the arrangements for my daughter’s wedding in Oct. ‘Don’t worry,’ he assured,” said his uncle Harbans Singh, adding the family had planned to arrange Harminder’s wedding next.“They are living in abject poverty. Harminder’s father Jaswant is landless and works as a labourer. He was their lone hope.” His body is expected to reach his village Sunday for cremation.J&K CM Omar Abdullah paid tributes at Chinar Corps HQ in Srinagar, while LG Manoj Sinha said: “Their valour, grit and determination will never be forgotten.

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and former Bihar deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav on Saturday criticized union home minister Amit Shah , accusing him of delivering repetitive and unproductive speeches during his visits to the state.Referring to his speech as “pakau-thakau,” Yadav alleged that BJP practices 'politics of negativity' and avoids discussing core issues such as unemployment, inflation, education, healthcare, poverty and large-scale migration from Bihar.Speaking to reporters, Yadav said, “Amit Shah speaks the same 'pakau-thaku' things whenever he visits. He should speak about the development of Bihar, about ending unemployment and inflation. He doesn't speak about any of these. Bihar will not benefit if they keep abusing Lalu Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav. Unless unemployment, poverty and migration end in Bihar, they do not speak about education and health facilities. Their is only the politics of negativity. Let them do it, this doesn't matter.”The strong reaction came in response to Amit Shah's recent visit to Sitamarhi on Friday where he laid the foundation stone for the redevelopment of Janki Mata Temple at Punaura Dham. Later, while addressing a public rally, Shah accused the Congress party and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav 's camp of opposing the government’s anti-terror Operation Sindoor He also criticized them for opposing the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the voter list in Bihar, accusing them of indulging in vote bank politics. He alleged that opposition parties oppose the SIR to protect “infiltrators” in their vote bank. The union home minister asserted that this exercise is not happening for the first time and dates back to former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s tenure.","Tejashwi yadav accuses amit shah of delivering repetitive and unproductive speeches.
