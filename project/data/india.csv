"Can't free Katara case lifer after 20-year term, Delhi government tells SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-free-katara-case-lifer-after-20-year-term-delhi-government-tells-sc/articleshow/118542041.cms,"SC: 20-year jail terms would become meaningless if state takes such stand

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday took exception to Delhi govt's stand that a convict, sentenced to life imprisonment with 20 years of jail term without remission , could not be released even after completion of the period.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan expressed surprise over the oral submission made by the Delhi govt counsel in the case of convict Sukhdev Yadav alisa Pehalwan in the Nitish Katara murder case and asked that it be said on oath in an affidavit. It said the govt's stand might amount to contempt of the court's order which awarded a 20-year jail term.How can a govt take such a stand? Twenty-year jail terms would become meaningless. The court had said 20-year imprisonment and now the state is saying he cannot be released even after 20 years,"" the bench said.The court was hearing a plea by Sukhdev Yadav alias Pehalwan who was sentenced to life imprisonment with a caveat that it shall be 20 years of actual imprisonment without consideration of remission. He was convicted in the 2002 Nitish Katara murder case and had filed a petition seeking furlough. As his jail term is about to get over in a few weeks, the court sought the state's response on when he could be released from jail.Senior advocate Aparajita Singh, appearing for Nitish's mother Neelam Katara, said it was a life sentence with 20 years without remission which meant that the convict could be eligible for remission after 20 years.The bench, however, was not convinced and disapproved of the state govt's stand on the issue relating to freedom. ""This is the concept of liberty for the state? We will deal with it. Let your home secretary take a stand on oath after taking legal opinion. If needed we can haul up your home secretary,"" the bench said.On Oct 3, 2016, Supreme Court had awarded 25-year jail term without any benefit of remission to Vikas Yadav and his cousin Vishal for their role in the kidnapping and killing of Nitish Katara. Co-convict Sukhdev Yadav was handed down a 20-year jail term in the case.Earlier, Delhi high court, while upholding the life imprisonment awarded to Vikas and Vishal Yadav by the trial court, had specified a 30-year sentence, without any remission, to the two. It had awarded 25-year jail term to Sukhdev Yadav.All three were convicted and sentenced for kidnapping Nitish from a marriage party on the night of Feb 16, 2002, and killing him for his alleged affair with Bharti Yadav, Vikas's sister. Bharti is the daughter of Uttar Pradesh politician D P Yadav who is in jail in connection with another murder case.",Sc: 20-year jail terms would become meaningless if state takes such stand.

"DTC losses mounted by Rs 35,000 crore in 6 years: CAG",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dtc-losses-mounted-by-rs-35k-crore-in-6-years-cag/articleshow/118541905.cms,"DTC losses mounted by Rs 35k crore in 6 years: CAG (Pic credit: PTI)

CAG points out deficient route planning by DTC

NEW DELHI: The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has stated that Delhi Transport Corporation 's cumulative losses soared from Rs 25,300 crore in 2015-16 to nearly 60,750 crore in 2021-22 as it was weighed down by dwindling fleet, with 45% of buses being overage and prone to high levels of breakdown, resulting in below-par fleet utilisation.In the long overdue report, expected to be tabled in assembly by the new BJP govt on Tuesday, the auditor pointed to multiple lapses, including the transport utility's inability to augment its fleet, sources told TOI. This is the first of 14 reports that the AAP govt had refused to share in the assembly.The primary reason for the losses was DTC fares remaining unchanged since 2009, sources said, with the Delhi govt refusing to pay heed to multiple requests. The burden further went up as women were given free bus rides. The auditor also pointed to the absence of any business plan and there was no roadmap to check the bleeding and to ensure its financial viability , said sources who have seen the report.The skeletal DTC fleet, with broken down buses part of commuters' daily experience, turned into a political issue, with BJP and Congress repeatedly talking up AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal's 2015 promise to boost the fleet by 10,000.In 2007, Delhi High Court had ordered that DTC should have a fleet of 11,000 buses. However, five years later, the Delhi cabinet pegged the number at 5,500. The CAG report is learnt to have pointed out that at the end of March 2022, DTC had a fleet of 3,937 buses, of which 1,770 were overage. The low-floor buses were more than 10 years old and were due to be phased out by the end of next month.Although there was a shortage of 1,740 buses, except the addition of 300 buses in 2022, procurement was not done despite Rs 233 crore being available. It did not avail of central assistance of another Rs 49 crore under FAME-I scheme, which CAG attributed to indecision and lack of clarity on specifications. A delay in the finalisation of 300 electric buses under FAME-II resulted in the contract period being reduced from 12 years to 10 years.An ageing fleet meant that DTC could not achieve operational efficiency compared to the national average. Besides, breakdowns ranged between 2.9 and 4.5 for every 10,000 km of operations, which was seen to be very high in comparison to other state transport corporations as well as cluster buses run by private operators on contract.CAG pointed out that the performance of cluster buses was much better than that of the DTC fleet on each operational parameter, despite both operating in similar circumstances.The federal auditor also faulted DTC for deficient route planning with the state utility operating on 468 routes or 57% of the total 814 routes. ""The corporation was unable to recover its operational cost in any of the routes operated by it. As a result, it suffered losses of Rs 14,199 crore on operations during 2015-22,"" a source said.While losses soared, the Delhi govt provided a revenue grant of Rs 13,381 crore between 2015 and 2022, which left a gap of Rs 818 crore. Further, DTC did not sign an MoU with the Delhi transport department setting physical and financial targets.Further, CAG is learnt to have pulled up DTC for not implementing an automatic fare collection system and having CCTV surveillance system that remained incomplete even nine years after the project was initiated.","Delhi transport corporation's losses soared from rs 25,300 crore in 2015-16 to nearly 60,750 crore in 2021-22.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Monday accused Congress of defending ""covert interference"" by foreign donors seeking to destabilise India's democracy, after the opposition party cited a finance ministry report on USAID-funded projects in India to claim that it has thoroughly exposed govt's ""lies"".BJP IT department head Amit Malviya claimed the desperation of Congress and its ecosystem to deflect from the controversial USAID funding routed through various ""George Soros-linked fronts and a labyrinth of NGO structures to meddle with India's electoral process is a dead giveaway"". ""It is now obvious who the beneficiaries are,"" he said on X.He said USAID projects are official govt-to-govt partnerships, transparently executed as externally aided projects. Centre simply channels these funds to states for development, which is well within the framework of cooperative federalism, Malviya added.The projects cited in the finance ministry's 2023-24 report trace their origins back to 2010-11, Malviya said, adding that this is not new as even the 2014-15 report confirms the same.He said the question is why Congress is defending ""covert interference"" by foreign donors and organisations linked to Soros and which seek to destabilise Indian democracy under the guise of philanthropy.""India's sovereignty is not up for sale. Let us drop the selective amnesia and political theatrics. Facts matter. India's governance will not be dictated by foreign agents masquerading as benefactors,"" Malviya said.For financial year 2023-24, an obligation of $97 million was made by USAID under the seven projects, the finance ministry report said.

Poll What Is Most Important for the Success of the Current Assembly Session? Advancing Development Projects Ensuring Financial Accountability

Will focus on making Delhi a 'viksit rajdhani': Sachdeva

NEW DELHI: CM Rekha Gupta said Sunday the previous AAP dispensation left the state coffers ""empty"", but assured that the BJP govt was ""committed"" to rolling out the Rs 2,500-per month honorarium scheme for eligible women.Addressing a joint press meet with Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva after a legislative party huddle, Gupta said several rounds of meetings had been held with govt officials on the issue in the past four days since she took over.""The condition the previous govt left for us... when we sit with officers to review the financial status... the entire govt exchequer is found empty,"" Gupta said, while replying to a question on preparations to implement the women's aid scheme. ""But giving the money to women is a routine work we have to do. We will surely implement the scheme with detailed planning. It's our commitment. We will do it 1,000%,"" the CM said.According to an estimate, after excluding taxpayers, govt servants and beneficiaries of other state welfare schemes, around 38 lakh women above 18 will be eligible for assistance under this scheme. The govt may need over Rs 11,000 crore annually for this.Giving a monthly honorarium of Rs 2,500 per month to women in Delhi under the ' Mahila Samriddhi Yojana ' was one of the prominent electoral promises made by BJP in the run-up to the assembly polls.The Delhi CM said the first day of the Delhi assembly session on Monday will see the election of Speaker and Deputy Speaker followed by the newly-elected legislators taking oath. She added that the three-day assembly session will focus on discussions about development projects. ""The most important aspect of the session, as we committed, will be the laying of the pending CAG reports in the house and the previous govt must now answer the people of Delhi for the misuse of their hard-earned money,"" Gupta said, adding that all commitments made by BJP will be fulfilled.On former CM Atishi's statement that her govt followed the procedure and forwarded the CAG reports to the lieutenant governor for approval before tabling them in the house, Sachdeva said the AAP dispensation was in a habit of ""peddling lies."" ""They should be ready to reply (on CAG reports),"" he added. The assembly session is starting Monday and will continue till Thursday.Sachdeva also said that the BJP govt in the next five years will focus on making Delhi a ""viksit rajdhani"" (developed capital). ""All MLAs discussed in the meeting on how to take forward the developmental works in their respective constituencies.

Chennai Water Safety: Govt rejects IIT Madras findings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/chennai-water-safe-govt-rejects-iit-madras-findings/articleshow/118511457.cms,"Chennai: Rejecting IIT Madras' findings, govt asserted that Chennai's drinking water sources, including lakes, are free from ‘forever chemicals' PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances).A state pollution control board study across 40 locations, including Chembarambakkam lake, Adyar river, and Buckingham Canal, found PFAS levels below the quantification threshold. Govt maintained that industries near waterbodies follow strict waste discharge policies, though some samples collected between Napier Bridge and Tondiarpet contained fluoride, iron, and chloride. On the outskirts and southern part of the city, sewage mixing was detected, and steps are being taken to address it.IIT-M's study reported PFAS levels between 23 and 136 ng/L about 400 times higher than advisory limits of 0.004-0.02 ng/L. NGT principal bench in New Delhi, taking suo motu cognizance, directed TN and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to hold a detailed examination.PFAS are synthetic chemicals, commonly found in non-stick cookware, upholstery, industrial materials, and food packaging. Their presence in drinking water has been linked to serious health risks, including liver damage, low infant birth weights, hormonal imbalances, fertility issues, immune system suppression, and even cancer.While Tamil Nadu has asserted that its water is safe, CPCB informed NGT that only a limited number of studies on forever chemicals have been conducted in India. Based on past research, CPCB noted a significant rise in perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) levels in water samples from south India. CPCB attributed this increase to a shift in industrial production from developed nations to countries such as China and India, following the US environmental protection agency's (EPA) phase-out initiative under the stewardship programme a voluntary agreement with manufacturers to reduce and eliminate PFAS use.The tribunal noted that while Bureau of Indian Standards has yet to set drinking water standards for PFAS, this does not absolve CPCB and the Union environment ministry from establishing compliance norms under Water Act, 1974. It has added the ministry as a respondent in the case, which is scheduled for a hearing on April 29.","Iit madras' study reported pfas levels between 23 and 136 ng/l about 400 times higher than advisory limits.

NEW DELHI/AMRITSAR: A batch of 12 illegal Indian immigrants deported from the US to Panama arrived Sunday in Delhi via Istanbul on a Turkish Airlines flight, making them the first group to be sent back without restraints since three American military aircraft brought 332 deportees to Amritsar within a fortnight this month.The 12 deportees are said to be among 50 undocumented Indian nationals who reportedly arrived in Panama recently. Panama has been assisting the US in its deportation efforts.According to local media reports, the UN-affiliated International Organisation for Migration helped purchase plane tickets for people of various nationalities whose citizenship was confirmed, 17 of them Indians. More deportees from the group are expected next week once MEA verifies their nationality.Deportation from Panama is being carried out under the Regional Assisted Voluntary Return Programme , an IOM protection and support response to facilitate the dignified, safe, regular and orderly return, as well as voluntary and based on an informed decision, of migrants to their countries of origin.Four men from Punjab in the latest batch took a connecting IndiGo flight from Delhi to Amritsar.Airport authorities in the city were informed in advance about the arrival of Patiala resident Jatinder Singh, Maninder Dutt of Jalandhar, and Jugraj Singh and Harpreet Singh from Gurdaspur, but it wasn't immediately clear whether they came unescorted all the way from Panama.Official sources said after the mandatory debriefing that Jatinder, 34, paid a travel agent from Patiala Rs 52 lakh to help him enter the US through a route criss-crossing Guyana, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico.Maninder, 21, put his faith and Rs 42 lakh in the hands of a Delhi-based illegal immigration agent, who then sent him on a perilous journey through Spain, Salvador, Guatemala, and Mexico. Jugraj and Harpreet, both 30, paid Rs 38 lakh each to an agent from Batala and reached the US via Nicaragua.Punjab NRI minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal said the state govt had registered cases against 15 travel agents based on complaints from natives of the state who were deported from the US this month. Of these, three agents have been arrested, while police have been raiding offices and homes in search of the absconding 12.Sources said the deportees who arrived on Sunday told authorities they intended to file cases against the travel agents who duped them only if there was a chance of getting their money back.The first US military flight that arrived on Feb 5 brought 104 deportees, with both men and women handcuffed and their feet shackled. The second flight, carrying 119 deportees, arrived on Feb 15. The third flight, with 112 deportees, landed on Feb 16, this time with only the men in shackles.",Four men from punjab in the latest batch took a connecting indigo flight from delhi to amritsar.

""The political resolution is talking about the danger of Hindutva-corporate authoritarianism going towards neo-fascism if BJP-RSS are not fought back and halted.""Unlike CPI and CPI (ML), both fiercely antagonistic towards the Sangh, CPM has all along taken an admittedly nuanced stand, with multiple political resolutions stating that the ""authoritarian and Hindutva communal attacks display emerging fascist trends"" (22nd party congress) and that the Modi govt was carrying out the ""fascist agenda of RSS"" (23rd party congress).Congress reacted sharply to the note while CPI said it couldn't understand the ""haste"" to cushion the fascist labelling of the Modi govt.""Fascist ideology teaches how religion and faith can be used for political gain and the BJP govt is implementing these in practice,"" CPI state secretary Binoy Viswam said.Leader of the opposition V D Satheesan of Congress said the CPM's assessment was part of its decision to ""align with Modi and work in subservience to the Sangh"".

BAREILLY: A drunk groom 's misstep at his own wedding in UP - in which he mistakenly garlanded his bride's best friend - set off a series of mishaps, ending with his arrest and the bride calling off the marriage.It started as Indian weddings often do - with a delay. The groom, Ravindra Kumar, 26, was late, and when he arrived, he didn't seem to be in a hurry, lingering with his friends, catching up over drinks.The 500-odd guests at a house in Naughwa Bhagwantpur village in Bareilly stayed in their seats as the bride waited. The garland-exchanging ceremony - one of those formalities that takes only a moment - was about to begin. Then, Kumar turned to the wrong woman. It was just a second. A miscalculation. But in that brief pause, before anyone could intervene, he placed the ceremonial garland over the bride's best friend.As confusion rippled through the crowd, he took the garland off and placed it around the neck of a male friend beside her. Then, to perhaps maintain a certain symmetry, he garlanded an elderly guest as well. There are moments when silence is more telling than noise. The wedding guests did not react immediately. They watched. The bride, Radha Devi, 21, did not. She slapped him and walked away. It had taken months of preparation.Omkar Verma, the bride's brother, said the family had spent over Rs 10 lakh on the wedding. He had his own theory for why things had gone wrong. ""They were unhappy with the dowry gifts. Maybe this was their way of humiliating us,"" he told TOI. ""And then we find out that he isn't even a farmer as his family told us-he's a truck driver.""At 4am, a complaint was filed at Kularia police station. By morning, the wedding was off, and Kumar was in police custody. By noon, he had apologised. His family suggested the wedding should go on. Radha refused.Circle officer Harsh Modi-used to break-ins and thefts but less accustomed to cases of misdirected garlanding-kept his summary brief. ""The groom was intoxicated. He misbehaved. His medical examination confirmed he was drunk. He was booked under sections of the Dowry Act.""","Medical examination confirms groom was drunk; booked under dowry act.

Complaints, which have been communicated to the govt, include pressuring the firm to inflate orders to contractors, stalling approvals for key staff and imposing arbitrary penalties.Systra sought diplomatic intervention. In a letter dated Nov 12, 2024, the French embassy asked Rupinder Singh, resident commissioner of Maharashtra in Delhi, to intervene for the firm, which cited ""severe harassment and challenges"" while working as general consultant on MMRDA projects.CM Devendra Fadnavis said the complaint had not reached him but he would speak to chief secretary Sujata Saunik. ""Transparency is at the core of our administration. We will ensure it is restored at any cost,"" Fadnavis told TOI.In its response, MMRDA called the allegations ""baseless"" and ""a deliberate attempt to malign"" the reputation of the agency and its personnel.Systra's complaint routed through the embassy highlighted its record in executing rail and metro projects in India and said, ""Since August 2023, Systra has been facing severe problems in its daily operations, escalating to the suspension of its payments due in January 2024.""It requested that the matter be ""studied in depth"" and left it in the hands of the resident commissioner ""to resolve the situation.""

As general consultant for Mumbai's Metro lines 5, 6, 7A, 9, 10, and 12, and detailed design provider for lines 2A, 7, and associated depots, the company alleges that MMRDA officials began pressing for monetary benefits, which were thinly veiled as demands from higher-ups.Systra claimed ""favours"" were sought on the pretext that the ""MC (metropolitan commissioner)"" was demanding it. Systra said it informed the authority that the company ""shall not be able to do the same"".Reacting to the allegations, MMRDA said a detailed report was sought from the department concerned and submitted to govt for consideration. The report revealed multiple contractual and regulatory violations by Systra, extending beyond the initial cost overruns of 4.27% to 10% in fees, it said.MMRDA said it has issued a termination notice to Systra for various violations, including security concerns and operational lapses. ""It is important to note that the present matter pertains to a commercial dispute,"" it said. ""Unfortunately, Systra appears to be attempting to escalate this into an issue between a foreign country and an agency of the government of Maharashtra, which is not an appropriate practice.""Systra's general manager for Mumbai, Arun Mishra, said, ""We cannot comment as the matter is sub judice."" Systra has approached Bombay high court over the issue.Between Jan and Feb 2024, Systra alleges that MMRDA issued payment suspension notices, citing supposed deficiencies in already-resolved issues on line 5 (Thane-Bhiwandi-Kalyan), 9 (Dahisar-Mira-Bhayander), 7A (Gundavli-Airport), and line 6 (Lokhandwala to Vikhroli). Additionally, MMRDA issued notices changing the scope of contractual work, alleging deficiencies in civil and systems contracts for line 10 (Gaimukh-Shivaji Chowk) and 12 (Kalyan-Taloja), issues that had already been resolved, it said.Systra said the payment suspension was lifted for lines 6, 5, 9, and 7A (systems) in June 2024 following the company's response. However, the freeze continues for lines 5, 9, and 7A (civil), with Rs 30 crore still unpaid. Systra also alleges MMRDA attempted to pressure the firm into approving inflated orders for a contractor on line 9. It said, ""Since we are not obliging... we believe MMRDA is continuing the suspension of payments for general consultant services for lines 5, 9, and 7A (civil). From what we understand, MMRDA is taking further steps to terminate the general consultant services for these contracts.""It claims similar pressure tactics are being applied to DB E&C, a German consultancy handling the general consultant contract for line 4. Systra and DB E&C are consortium partners for lines 10 and 12. Systra said MMRDA has stopped making payments on these projects, including the ones where suspension notices were revoked. Compounding the issue, Systra says MMRDA has stalled approvals for key staff, imposed arbitrary penalties, and demanded certifications for payments to minor contractors hired directly by the agency.","French firm levels graft charges against mmrda, seeks diplomatic intervention.

NEW DELHI: Facing allegations from Centre that ""lakhs of crores of rupees"" were being collected through issuance of halal certification for various products, including cement, iron bars, bottles, etc, Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind Halal Trust told SC Monday that govt's statement in court ""was completely incorrect, vexatious and scandalous"".In an affidavit filed in SC to counter Centre's allegation, the trust said it had never given certification to cement and iron bars and pleaded the court to seek explanation from Centre on what basis it had made the statement. It also said its annual collection is close to only Rs 2.1 crore, out of which Rs 59.2 lakh is paid as tax. It, however, justified halal certification for lipstick, tulsi water , biscuit, water bottle, etc, saying it is done to ensure that animal fat, bones or any other component has not been used in their manufacturing.Referring to Centre's statement during court hearing on Jan 20, the affidavit said, ""It is submitted that statements of Centre are completely incorrect, vexatious and scandalous. The statements are without any basis, inconsistent with the record and the pleadings sworn on oath by public officials submitted before this court. The instructing officer of govt has shown irresponsible behaviour while instructing the solicitor general to make such statements. This court may direct govt for disclosure of the fact as to which officer instructed the SG to make such statement before this court as these statements have caused serious prejudice to the concept of halal; which is considered to be one of the basic requirements of behaviour and lifestyle of a very large community of our country.""Centre had told court that 'halal' certification was not confined to food items but it was done for all sorts of products, even cement & iron bars have to be halal-certified.Responding to allegations, the trust said, ""It is submitted that the petitioner has not issued any halal certification to iron bars or cement. Govt is hereby put to strict proof for producing such certification having been granted to any of such manufacturing. However, there are few, predominantly, steel and cement manufacturing companies which produce materials to be used in preserving or protecting edible materials, like tin plates/food cans (for packaging) and are interested in doing their export for their material benefit. When it comes to making exports outside India, the importing establishments from outside India, place conditions on exporting companies that the said materials be halal certified.""The trust said halal certification is a serious issue of religious belief and practice of a large section of Indian citizenry and the same is protected under Article 25 and 26 of the Constitution and it is also related to international trade and commerce.""It is further submitted that halal certification, mostly, if not all, are consumer driven. In the process as to whether this certification is required or not, there is no role to be played by the certifying agency. It is a business decision of manufacturing companies to opt for such certifications because consumers, who want to consume certain products, necessarily want such certifications,"" it said.","Jamiat ulama-i-hind halal trust tells sc govt's statement in court ""was completely incorrect, vexatious and scandalous"" trust says its annual collection is close to only rs 2.1 crore, out of which rs 59.2 lakh is paid as tax.

Indian-origin billionaire’s daughter Vasundhara Oswal narrates shocking ordeal in Uganda jail

Arrested without a warrant, thrown into a van

Denied legal rights, trapped in the system

From petty crimes to murderers’ block

'They wanted money'

Seeking justice

NEW DELHI: Vasundhara Oswal , daughter of Indian-origin billionaire Pankaj Oswal , has broken her silence on her three-week nightmare behind bars in Uganda. Falsely accused of kidnapping and murdering her father’s former employee, she endured prison conditions that she calls a “gross violation of human rights.”The 26-year-old was arrested on October 1, 2024, over the alleged abduction of Mukesh Menaria , a former employee of Pankaj Oswal. However, the case crumbled when Menaria was found alive in Tanzania just days later.Despite this, Vasundhara remained imprisoned for weeks. Speaking to PTI on Friday, she recalled the horrors she faced, ""I was detained for five days, then thrown in prison for two weeks. I wasn’t allowed to shower, and they denied me food and water. My parents had to bribe police officers just to get me basic necessities.”At one point, she was reportedly denied access to a washroom as punishment.According to Vasundhara, Ugandan police raided her premises without a warrant and took her away under false pretenses. ""When I asked them to present a search warrant, they said, ‘We are in Uganda, we can do anything. You’re not in Europe anymore,’” she alleged.She claimed a male officer physically forced her into a police van when she refused to comply immediately.Forced to give a statement without a criminal lawyer, Vasundhara said she was made to pay $30,000 and surrender her passport for a police bond—yet she was still thrown back in her cell. Even after obtaining an unconditional release order from the courts, she was illegally detained for another 72 hours.Shockingly, instead of dismissing the case after Menaria was found alive on October 10, authorities kept her in prison and even escalated her charges from kidnapping to attempted murder.Initially housed in a facility for petty criminals, Vasundhara was later moved to a prison for convicted murderers and human traffickers. She spent two weeks in Nakasongola prison , fearing for her life.After weeks of legal battles, she secured bail on October 21, but her ordeal was far from over. Her passport was only returned on December 10, and the case was not dismissed until December 19.Vasundhara alleges that corrupt officials kept the charges alive even after Menaria was found, reducing them later to a misdemeanor confinement charge—all in an attempt to extort more money.""This was done to keep something over our heads and squeeze more money from my family,"" she said.Now free, Vasundhara wants the Ugandan government to be held accountable for what she calls an unjust persecution. ""This is up to the Ugandan government to correct its mistakes. We have invested in their country for years, and this is how they treat us?"" she said.As she reviews legal options, her case has raised global concerns over police corruption and human rights violations in Uganda.","Vasundhara oswal was detained in a cell after providing a statement and was asked to pay usd 30,000 and surrender her passport as part of a police bond.

She also increased the private-practice distance cap from 20 km to 30 km for state service doctors (they can now conduct private practice up to 30 km from their workplace) and, in another significant decision, scrapped the suspension of seven Midnapore Medical College junior doctors (which followed the death of a young mother after a Caesarean delivery).The CM also outlined her expectations from the community: doctors should spend at least the required eight hours at their workplace and seniors should not leave patient care, including Caesarean deliveries, to junior doctors. Doctors should not have any ""political colour""; they should rise above politics and have ""only one colour (humanity)"", she said.Monday's meet, organised by the grievance cell set up by the state in the wake of the RG Kar crime and the public protests that followed it, was Banerjee's first with a general body of doctors following the August 9 incident (though she has met agitating doctors as well as other small groups of doctors in the interim). Her 40-minute speech started with a reference to the RG Kar crime: ""I extend my condolences to the family of the sister who was killed. We demand proper punishment. Our government has passed the Aparajita Bill but it is pending (with Rashtrapati Bhavan). I give the responsibility to my brothers (so that such incidents are not repeated); you protect our sisters.

More than 48 hours, still 8 people trapped after tunnel collapsed

Chances of survival very, very remote: Telangana minister Krishna Rao

'Gush of water increased and loose soil also started falling off': Survivor

Six teams of rat miners have arrived in Telangana's Nagarkurnool to assist in the ongoing rescue operation for the Srisailam Left Bank Canal collapse (SLBC), where eight workers are trapped.Firoz Qureshi, a member of rat miner's team, said that a total 6 more teams set to join their 6 teams who already arrived for the rescue of 8 more people, who are trapped after the tunnel collapsed.""I have come from Delhi, our whole team has come from Delhi, Collector has called us here. 6 of us have come here and 6 more will be coming, we are a team of 12 people. In Uttarakhand, we had rescued 41 labourers...till now, we have not received much information. As of now, we have been told that we need to go along with NDRF and SDRF teams. It will be difficult to say something until we see the situation there,"" he added.These Rat miners were previously involved in the successful rescue mission during the Uttarkashi tunnel collapse in Uttarakhand that occurred on October 31 last year.A miner from the team discussed the difficulties ahead, noting that the presence of water in the tunnel and the considerable distance would present significant obstacles during the rescue operation. Nevertheless, he remained optimistic about their chances of success."" We have come from Delhi...we will go inside along with the NDRF and SDRF teams. We will be able to say something when we see the situation inside...our 12-member team rescued the labourers when an incident took place in Uttarakhand during Diwali...we took part in the last 26-hour operation...that situation was different from here...there is difficulty as the distance where the incident has happened is 14 km from entrance point and because of water as well...it might take some time, but we hope that we will succeed,"" one of the members of the Rat miners team.The survival prospects appear grim for the eight individuals who have been trapped for more than two days in the SLBC tunnel following its partial collapse. The rescue teams continue their tireless efforts to reach them. The Indian Army, Navy, NDRF, and other agencies have faced significant challenges in their rescue attempts, having to work through dense muck, intertwined iron rods, and cement blocks.The accident occurred at the Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) project in Telangana's Nagarkurnool district on Saturday morning.A substantial rescue force comprising 584 skilled personnel from the Army, Navy, Singareni Collieries, and other agencies, alongside central and state disaster response teams, has conducted seven tunnel inspections. Official sources confirm that gas cutters are being used continuously to cut through the metal obstructions.The rescue operation also employed sniffer dogs to locate the trapped individuals. However, their progress was hindered by water accumulation in the tunnel.The chances of survival of the eight persons who remain trapped in the SLBC tunnel after a partial collapse two days ago are ""very remote,"" though every effort is being made to reach them, Telangana Minister Jupally Krishna Rao said on Monday.""To be honest, the chances of their survival are very, very, very, very remote. Because, I myself went up to the end, almost just 50 meters short (of the mishap site).When we took photographs, the end (of the tunnel) was visible. And out of the 9 meter diameter (of the tunnel)--almost 30 feet, out of that 30 feet, mud has piled up up to 25 feet"", he said.""When we shouted their names also, there was no response...so, there is no chance at all,"" he said.During the ongoing rescue mission for the eight trapped personnel, survivors of the incident remained hopeful for their colleagues' safe return whilst recounting the harrowing events they witnessed.Nirmal Sahu, a worker from Jharkhand, described how on February 22 morning, they encountered a sudden increase in water flow inside the tunnel, accompanied by falling loose soil. He told PTI videos that whilst some workers managed to escape after recognising the imminent danger, eight individuals remained trapped inside.Obi Sahu, who is related to one of the trapped workers, Sandeep Sahu, mentioned that several workers sustained minor injuries whilst fleeing from the tunnel.","The accident occurred at the srisailam left bank canal (slbc) project in telangana's nagarkurnool district on saturday morning.

J&K is peaceful even now but you should make sure that the peace is permanent,” he said while exhorting the children to carry back the message of peace and development that they have witnessed in rest of the country during the ‘Watan ko Jano’ tour, to their family, friends, neighbours and village in J&K.Around 250 children from J&K visited Jaipur and Delhi as part of the tour aimed at familiarising them with the social and cultural diversities of the country and bringing about an emotional connect among them. “We got a chance to visit the Hawa Mahal and enjoyed the non-Kashmiri cuisine in Jaipur,” Samriti Balraj from Reasi replied when asked by Shah about her experience. “Get your parents to visit next,” he promptly advised.Stating that he sincerely believes that “no govt can maintain peace in J&K as only its children can”, the home minister asked the young J&K visitors to convince their parents and neighbourhood that the entire country belongs to them and that terrorism should be replaced with peaceful co-existence “that is witnessed in the other parts of the country”. To make sure that his message was understood by the children, the home minister gave the analogy of a house with several rooms, saying that states/UTs are like rooms that make India and that Kashmir is one such room. “Like you visit all rooms in your house, you must familiarise with the other states/UTs as well,” he said, even persuading them jokingly to fight with their parents to plan their next family vacation outside J&K.Stating that J&K had witnessed a major change in the last 10 years, with civilian deaths down by 80% and a big push to development, infrastructure and industry, Shah said he was still not satisfied as he firmly believes that not a single Kashmiri youth should die. “Fifteen years ago there were no religious processions like tazia, schools were facing shutdowns and cinema halls were closed. In the past 10 years, roads, bridges, hospitals and educational institutions came up...we empowered the grassroots with the panchayati raj system. Stone-pelting, bomb attacks and terrorism were controlled and school shutdowns became a thing of the past...Development follows when there is peace..You should tell your family and friends that terrorism will not lead you anywhere,” he said.",Around 250 children from j&k visited jaipur and delhi as part of the tour aimed at familiarising them with the social and cultural diversities of the country. ‘watan ko jano’ (know your country) programme aimed at bringing about an emotional connect among them.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118540219,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1144546,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
