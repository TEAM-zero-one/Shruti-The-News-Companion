INDORE: New CCTV footage that surfaced on Saturday in Raja Raghuvanshi murder case shows prime accused Raj Kushwaha holding a white shroud and a floral garland while standing outside the victim's residence on the day of his funeral.The footage, captured on June 4 when Raja's body was brought to his Indore home, shows Raj not only participating in the rituals but also consoling Sonam Raghuwanshi's father, Devi Singh. Raj is seen placing his hand on Devi Singh's shoulder and remaining close to him throughout the mourning.While pictures of Raj consoling Sonam's father had gone viral on social media earlier, this footage has raised suspicion as it shows him making repeated phone calls during the funeral. Investigators suspect he may have been relaying real-time updates from the house, possibly to Sonam.Officials are now trying to determine whom Raj was communicating with during the funeral and whether the calls were connected to a larger conspiracy behind Raja's murder.

The byelection, held on Thursday, saw a voter turnout of 69.85% by 5pm and was largely peaceful, aside from a few isolated incidents.Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee expressed gratitude saying, ""People of all religions, castes, races and walks of life in the area have blessed us immensely by exercising their right to vote in the by-elections to the Kaliganj Assembly constituency.

House in Mumbai: Richest 5% need 109 years' savings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/house-in-mumbai-richest-5-need-109-years-savings/articleshow/122035515.cms,"This is an AI image

Even for the top 5% of urban families by income in Maharashtra, buying a house in Mumbai would take more than 100 years of saving to fund. In Haryana and Odisha, it would take over 50 years of saving by the richest 5% to buy a house in their biggest cities. Chandigarh, by contrast, is the most affordable capital.These numbers have been arrived at by comparing the income of the top 5% households in a state/UT with average price of a 110sq m (1,184sq ft) house in its capital city - the middle of the three house size categories for which National Housing Board (NHB) compiles data. In 2022-23, India's gross savings to GDP ratio was 30.2%, and the same ratio has been applied to calculate savings of the richest 5% households.The income of the top 5% of urban families is derived from the average Monthly Per Capita Consumption Expenditure (MPCE) of the top 5% of urban folks in a state. The rural MPCE is considerably lower.In Maharashtra, for instance, the urban MPCE for the top 5% is Rs 22,352 per person per month. For a family of four, the income would be Rs 89,408 per month or Rs 10.7 lakh per annum.Applying the 30.2% saving rate to Maharashtra's top 5% families, their annual savings would be around Rs 3.2 lakh.NHB's data on house prices shows that the per square foot price for a house with a carpet area between 645 sq feet and 1,184 sq feet was Rs 29,911 in March 2025.This means a 1,184 square feet house on average cost over Rs 3.5 crore in Mumbai. With a saving of Rs 3.2 lakh per annum, the top 5% urban families of Maharashtra would have to save for 109 years to afford this house.NHB's average carpet area price is based on the registration data collected from sub-registrar offices (SROs) as well as the valuation data collected from primary lending institutions.A similar calculation shows that for the top 5% urban families in Haryana, it would take 63 years to afford a house of similar size in Gurgaon.

NEW DELHI: AAP won two, while BJP, Congress and Trinamool Congress picked up one each in assembly bypolls to five seats across Gujarat, Punjab, Kerala and Bengal. Voting was held on June 19, with results declared Monday.In Gujarat, AAP's Gopal Italia clinched Visavadar seat in Junagadh by 17,554 votes, defeating BJP's Kirit Patel. Italia, a former state unit president, secured 75,942 votes as BJP failed to break an 18-year losing streak in the constituency.BJP retained the SC-reserved Kadi seat in Mehsana, where Rajendra Chavda trounced Congress's Ramesh Chavda by 39,452 votes. BJP now holds 162 seats in Gujarat's 182-member assembly. Congress state chief Shaktisinh Gohil stepped down, accepting responsibility for the party's poor performance in both seats.The contest followed the death of BJP MLA Karshan Solanki in Feb. Visavadar had fallen vacant in Dec 2023 after AAP's Bhupendra Bhayani resigned and joined BJP. Bypolls were delayed as Bhayani's election was under judicial scrutiny, until Congress's Harshad Ribadiya - who had filed the case in high court - joined BJP and withdrew his petition this year.Congress last held Visavadar in 2017 under Ribadiya, who lost to Bhayani in 2022. BJP last won the seat in 2007 through Kanu Bhalala. Former CM Keshubhai Patel captured it in 2012 on a Gujarat Parivartan Party ticket.In Punjab's Ludhiana West, AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjeev Arora won by 10,637 votes. The seat fell vacant after AAP MLA Gurpreet Gogi died in Jan. Congress's Bharat Bhushan Ashu got 24,542 votes, BJP's Jiwan Gupta 20,323. Ashu, a two-time MLA and former cabinet minister, resigned as working president of the party's state unit, saying: ""I, and not the Congress party, contested the election. So, I must take the responsibility of defeat. ""Calling the twin wins ""a major boost"" ahead of the 2027 state elections in Gujarat and Punjab, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal said: ""Both Congress and BJP contested the elections together... But people rejected them in both places."" He dismissed speculation about replacing Arora in Rajya Sabha. ""I am not going to RS. The party's political affairs panel will decide whom to nominate.""The name of senior party member Manish Sisodia is doing the rounds as Arora's replacement, with another senior member, Satyendar Jain (co-incharge, Punjab), also in the reckoning. There is also talk of the party going for a party member from Punjab as it may want Sisodia to focus on his job as in-charge of Punjab - the only state where AAP is in office.TMC retained Kaliganj in Bengal, where Alifa Ahmed defeated BJP's Ashish Ghosh by over 50,000 votes. Daughter of the late legislator Nasiruddin Ahmed, whose death in Feb prompted the bypolls, the 38-year-old engineer left her IT job in Kolkata to contest. Congress, backed by the Left Front, finished third but increased its vote share to 28,348 - around 3,000 more than in 2021. BJP's vote count dropped to 52,710.In Kerala, Congress wrested Nilambur from CPM in a major win before the 2026 assembly polls. Aryadan Shoukath defeated CPM's M Swaraj by 11,077 votes. Independent PV Anvar, once a Left ally and Trinamool's Kerala convenor, took nearly 20,000 votes, denting CPM's prospects. BJP polled around 8,000 votes, consistent with past performances.Shoukath reclaimed father Aryadan Mohammed's former stronghold after nine years. Anvar had won Nilambur in 2021 as a CPM-backed independent but resigned earlier this year after falling out with CM Pinarayi Vijayan. The result marks first time Congress-led UDF has flipped a sitting LDF seat since current Left govt took office. CPM's M Swaraj has now lost twice in a row after a 2021 defeat in Thripunithara.","Voting was held on june 19, with results declared monday.

"Mughal Road gets tunnel, Omar Abdullah says ‘major achievement of my govt’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mughal-road-gets-tunnel-omar-abdullah-says-major-achievement-of-my-govt/articleshow/122033386.cms,"SRINAGAR: The Union government’s approval on Monday of 19 major road and tunnel projects worth Rs 10,637 crore, including a key tunnel on the historical Mughal Road linking Shopian, in the Kashmir Valley, with Poonch in Jammu, has caused widespread excitement across Kashmir.The proposed Peer Ki Gali tunnel, which will turn the 84-km Mughal Road into an all-weather road providing a crucial alternative to the Srinagar-Jammu national highway, has excited political leaders across the board. “It is a major achievement of my government,” Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah said.Construction of a modern road on the old Mughal Road began in the 1970s, during the government of Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, but the project saw little progress. It was revived in 2003 under Mufti Mohammad Sayeed’s government, and by 2009 traffic was allowed during the tenure of Omar Abdullah. Though the road is now operational, it remains open only during summer as heavy snowfall on the key stretches of Peer Ki Gali and Bafliaz forces its closure in winter.Over the past eight months the National Conference government has been pushing for the tunnel project on the Mughal Road.“We have been working hard on this and held several rounds of discussions with government of India, particularly the ministry of road transport and highways. Finally, these major projects have been sanctioned,” CM Omar Abdullah told TOI. “The tunnel on the Mughal Road is of crucial importance as it will provide year-round connectivity between Kashmir and Jammu. It holds both strategic and commercial value.”Omar said that ever since he first drove on the Mughal Road in 2009, his party and his government have been advocating for construction of a tunnel. “We’ve been pursuing this for years, and I am glad it has finally received approval,” he said.Among the sanctioned projects is also the Sadhana Tunnel, which will connect Kupwara with the border region of Karnah, at an estimated cost of Rs 3,330 crore. Omar said he will also pursue a tunnel project for Gurez Valley in north Kashmir and intends to raise the matter with the Union government.The Mughal Road also holds historical significance. It was used by Mughal emperors in the 16th century to enter Kashmir. Emperor Akbar took this route to conquer the region in 1586, and his son, Jahangir, is believed to have died near Rajouri while returning from Kashmir.In a separate statement issued in Srinagar, both LG Manoj Sinha and Omar thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari for approving these major projects.National Conference was quick to take credit, stating that “under the leadership of J&K CM Omar Abdullah our government has successfully convinced government of India to take up key infrastructure projects like the Mughal Road tunnel and the tunnel to Tangdhar.”A senior NC politician said the projects were sanctioned because J&K’s elected government pursued them with the Union government.","The proposed peer ki gali tunnel will turn the 84-km mughal road into an all-weather road providing a crucial alternative to the srinagar-jammu national highway. “it is a major achievement of my government,” jammu and kashmir chief minister omar abdullah said.

NEW DELHI: After a campaign for assured pension, there is only a small proportion of central govt employees who have opted for the Unified Pension Scheme , offering assured 50 per cent pension, with several seeking further clarifications to exercise the one-time option.As a result, govt has extended the June-end deadline by three months. Employees want to be absolutely sure about the terms of the agreement before deciding to switch to UPS.A concern for employees who joined national pension system from 2004 is the lack of clarity on death benefits. While an assurance was given last week, there are still a few issues that are to be resolved.Under the UPS, while an employee will contribute 10 per cent of his or her salary towards pension, a matching contribution will be made by the Centre, which was 14 per cent under NPS. Under the new scheme, apart from the 10 per cent pension payment, another 8.5 per cent contribution is to be made by the Centre which will not reflect in the balance of the subscriber’s account. While most employees understand the change, there are some who believe that the payout may be lower.Further, some of the all India service officers want to know about the difference in contribution between the Centre and states, which don’t have a scheme yet.An IAS, IPS or Indian Forest Service officer spends time in the state with some of them also opting for central deputation. While the rules are quite clear, some of the officers have raised doubts.Meanwhile, fund managers, who have been asked to conduct outreach programmes, are smelling a rat and allege that some private players are sowing doubts as they stand to lose out on the annuity business under UPS.Employees now have time to exercise the switching option up to the end of September. The option can be exercised by 23 lakh government employees.",Only a small proportion of central govt employees have opted for the unified pension scheme.
