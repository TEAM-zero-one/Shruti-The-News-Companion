New Delhi: Forty-eight hours after publication of the draft electoral roll in Bihar, booth level agents (BLAs) of 12 political parties in the state were yet to file any claim or objection against wrongful inclusions and exclusions. However, 941 individual applicants came forward between 3pm on Aug 2 and 3pm on Aug 3 to submit claims or objections.EC, in its daily update on claims and exclusions on Sunday, said it also received 4,374 applications over the past two days from newly eligible electors, seeking enrolment by submitting their Form 6 and mandatory declaration.Parties, including RJD, Congress, CPM, BJP, JD(U), BSP, AAP, National People's Party, CPI(ML) Liberation, LJP, Rashtriya LJP and Rashtriya Lok Samta Party, have over 1.6 lakh BLAs in the field to study the draft rolls for any inclusion of ineligible persons or exclusion of eligible electors.EC sources said the list of nearly 65 lakh deletions from the roll as it existed on June 24, 2025 was prepared with the involvement of BLAs and also shared with them on July 20. ""So practically, they have had a much longer window - of the past 13 days - to spot any wrongful inclusions or exclusions,"" an EC official said.","Ec received 4,374 applications over the past two days from newly eligible electors.

EC needs 'Parliamentary oversight' to save its credibility: Gogoi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-needs-parliamentary-oversight-to-save-its-credibility-gogoi/articleshow/123082712.cms,"NEW DELHIl In the middle of a war of wits between government and the opposition over the revision of Bihar's electoral rolls and allegations of bias against Election Commission, deputy leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Gaurav Gogoi has said the poll watchdog should be brought under ""parliamentary oversight"" to save its credibility - a demand that may touch off a new debate amid the chaos that threatens to sink the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament.The Congress MP said Parliament had a role in the appointment process of EC through the presence of the leader of opposition in the collegium for its selection, but had no role in its regular functioning and oversight. He said the same was true of other constitutional bodies.""The credibility of EC is at stake, and until some parliamentary oversight is brought over EC, it will remain a tool at the hands of govt,"" he told TOI. Gogoi said the nature of parliamentary oversight could be debated but the fact that it was required cannot be disputed any more.The opposition is set to escalate its focus on EC in coming days, with INDIA bloc demanding that govt schedule a discussion on Bihar's rolls review in Parliament, a demand that looks likely to blockade the two Houses in the coming weeks. At the same time, Congress MP and LoP in LS Rahul Gandhi is set to lead a protest in Bengaluru on Tuesday against what he alleges is tampering of the voters' list in Bangalore Rural LS seat - a sample that Congress has researched to claim similar irregularities exist elsewhere.He may also give a presentation on the ""Bangalore findings"" of Congress to allies on Thursday.Gogoi argued, ""I think to put EC back on track should be the duty of every citizen. It is not for a party but for the future of Indian democracy.""Buttressing his demand, he said other democracies had parliamentary oversight over all key organisations, including law enforcement and intelligence. ""Parliament should be supreme when it comes to these institutions that are at the bedrock of Indian democracy,"" he said.","Deputy leader of opposition in lok sabha gaurav gogoi has said the poll watchdog should be brought under ""parliamentary oversight"" the opposition is set to escalate its focus on ec in coming days.

NEW DELHI: An Army official allegedly “grievously assaulted” four SpiceJet employees at Srinagar Airport on July 26, 2025, after they asked him to pay for excess cabin baggage he was carrying on a flight (SG 386) to Delhi. The airline says its staff members “suffered a spinal fracture and serious jaw injuries after being attacked with punches, repeated kicks and a queue stand.”The passenger, an army officer, “was carrying two pieces of cabin baggage weighing a total of 16 kg, more than double the permitted limit of 7 kg. When politely informed of the excess baggage and asked to pay the applicable charges, the passenger refused and forcefully entered the aerobridge without completing the boarding process – a clear violation of aviation security protocols. He was escorted back to the gate by a CISF official. At the gate, the passenger grew increasingly aggressive and physically assaulted four members of the SpiceJet ground staff,” a SpiceJet spokesperson said.""One SpiceJet employee collapsed unconscious on the floor but the passenger continued kicking and hitting the fainted employee. Another staff member suffered bleeding from the nose and mouth after receiving a forceful kick to the jaw while bending down to assist the colleague who had fainted.The injured employees were rushed to hospital and remain under treatment for the grievous injuries sustained,” he added.PRO (Defence), Srinagar, said in a statement: ""The matter involving an alleged altercation between an Army personnel and airline staff at Srinagar Airport on July 26, 2025, has come to the notice of the Indian Army.

While 65 lakh voters are in danger of being disenfranchised in Bihar, reports of ""adding"" 6.5 lakh persons as voters in Tamil Nadu is alarming and patently illegal.

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday launched a sharp attack on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi , calling him 'anti-national' and accusing him of supporting only Muslims from Bangladesh and Pakistan, as reported by news agency PTI.Speaking to reporters during a election campaign meeting in the Bodoland Territorial Region, Sarma also claimed that the Congress party does ""not respect icons of Assam"", such as the Kamakhya temple and spiritual reformer Mahapurush Srimanta Sankardeva.""Rahul Gandhi is an anti-India person. He is only with Bangladeshi and Pakistani Muslims. He is not with Indian Hindus, not even with Indian Muslims. Rahul Gandhi is an anti-national personality,"" Sarma alleged.He did not provide any specific reasons for labelling Rahul Gandhi, the current Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha, as anti-national.Just days before, Rahul Gandhi had criticized CM Sarma during his visit to Guwahati.

He stated that unlike Gandhi, he is a true son of Assam, raised by its soil and people.

"Govt says National Medical Commission rules allow complaints against docs, but commission rejects them",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-says-national-medical-commission-rules-allow-complaints-against-docs-but-commission-rejects-them/articleshow/123076303.cms,"NEW DELHI: Responding to a Parliament question on whether the National Medical Commission (NMC) was biased towards doctors, the health ministry has stated that the ethics regulation of 2002 provided for complaints against doctors. However, NMC’s ethics section has been rejecting all patient appeals claiming that the NMC Act prevails over the 2002 ethics regulation.The NMC act states that doctors can file appeals against state medical council decisions. Referring to this, the ethics section has been dismissing all appeals filed by patients claiming that only doctors can file an appeal, even though it is against the law.The NMC Act itself clearly states that “the rules and regulations made under the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956, shall continue to be in force and operate till new standards or requirements are specified under this Act or the rules and regulations made thereunder”.Since the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 has not been replaced, it still stands. Clause 8.8 of the 2002 ethics regulation states: “Any person aggrieved by the decision of the State Medical Council on any complaint against a delinquent physician, shall have the right to file an appeal to the MCI within a period of 60 days from the date of receipt of the order passed by the said Medical Council”.Yet, over 162 appeals of patients have been rejected by the NMC.In the reply to Parliament, minister of state for health Anupriya Patel stated that “to ensure that the NMC functions in a transparent and fair manner”, the central government appoints the chairperson and presidents of four autonomous boards as per the NMC Act 2019. However, there is no transparency as even the minutes of the meetings of the NMC and its autonomous boards are not available in the public domain as used to be the case with the erstwhile Medical Council of India. Moreover, all autonomous boards including the posts of presidents are currently almost entirely vacant with the government having failed to make appointments for over 10 months.The few minutes of commission’s meetings accessed using RTI show that most non-doctor ex-officio members hardly ever attend meetings and hence most decisions are taken by commission members, almost most of whom are doctors. Of the 33-member commission, about 20 are doctors.“I have complained to the health ministry and the law ministry by registered post about NMC rejecting patient appeals and hence I have proof. So, the health ministry cannot claim to have not received any complaints,” said Gokul Aneja, husband of a victim of alleged medical negligence, who appealed against the decision of the Punjab state medical council, only to have his appeal rejected twice.","The nmc act states that doctors can file appeals against state medical council decisions.

INDIA bloc planning march to EC office

NEW DELHI: As the month-long monsoon session of Parliament enters its third week on Monday, another round of deadlock is not ruled out even as the govt has no option but to seek passage of several crucial bills, amid opposition's determined bid to carry on with its protests over the special intensive revision (SIR) of Bihar's electoral rolls.Opposition parties have been demanding a discussion on the SIR exercise, which the govt has rejected because it cannot make a reply on behalf of the Election Commission, an independent constitutional body not represented by any department. Besides, the govt has cited a ruling of former speaker Balram Jakhar that Parliament can't discuss the administrative work of constitutional bodies like EC.The govt is likely to remain firm on its stand and has more reasons for it as it will cite the ""double voter ID"" held by Bihar opposition leader, RJD's Tejashwi Yadav. Yadav had said that his name from the voters' roll had been omitted, a claim promptly rejected by EC, which disclosed the voter roll number and sought a reply from him for holding two EPIC cards.The govt's confidence to negate the opposition's claims has further grown as the analysis of SIR figures has shown no systematic targeting of Muslims. Figures released Friday also show that migrants have not been affected and the number of deletions in constituencies where BJP-led NDA candidates won is not higher than in those taken by the opposition 'Mahagathbandhan' in Bihar.With more reasons to assert that there are no irregularities in the SIR exercise, the govt is likely to push the passage of a key sports bill in Lok Sabha. The Lower House has listed the National Sports Governance Bill, which envisages greater transparency in the functioning of sports bodies, including BCCI, for consideration and passage.Rajya Sabha has listed for passage on Monday a resolution from home minister Amit Shah on the extension of President's Rule in Manipur by another six months with effect from Aug 13.Except for a two-day discussion on the Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor in both the Houses, parliamentary proceedings have been all but a washout since the session began on July 21 as the SIR has ignited vociferous protests from opposition parties.INDIA bloc, which has in previous sessions often spoken in different voices, has joined ranks over the issue, alleging that EC's exercise is aimed at removing voters sympathetic to its agenda and boosting the prospects of NDA.EC has said it will roll out the exercise nationally to ""protect"" the integrity of electoral rolls to ensure only eligible voters are allowed to cast votes. However, leader of opposition in LS Rahul Gandhi has accused EC of ""vote chori (stealing votes)"" and has been fiercely critical of the poll body. EC in a statement Saturday rejected Rahul's allegations as ""baseless"", ""unsubstantiated"" and ""misleading"".INDIA bloc is mulling a march to the EC office on Friday to protest the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar and the exercise being planned nationally. The march, if finalised, would come a day after the opposition alliance meets for a dinner discussion on Thursday. The meeting has been called to discuss the Bihar SIR exercise, but Rahul Gandhi may give a presentation to allies on the “deep dive” in a sample seat — Bangalore rural LS — that Congress has done which, he claimed, has unearthed irregularities in the voters’ list. He has called it the modus operandi of how voters’ lists are being manipulated all over states.","The month-long monsoon session of parliament enters its third week on monday.

NEW DELHI: The opposition may field a strong ""ideological"" face as candidate in the vice-presidential election, as it looks to portray a strong contrast with the governing BJP's nominee to send out a political message across the country.Ahead of discussions on picking a candidate, it is felt that since winnability is an uphill task due to opposition's weaker numerical strength in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, INDIA bloc should use the vice-president (VP) contest to send out an unambiguous signal to its core constituencies of marginalised sections, including backwards and minorities, farmers, and intellectuals and the civil society.INDIA bloc is scheduled to meet Thursday (Aug 7), where Bihar assembly election is likely to be an issue as also the special intensive revision of the state's electoral rolls. The meeting, sources said, may also initiate a preliminary discussion on the likely candidate for the VP polls.At the meet, Rahul Gandhi may give a presentation on Congress 's ""research"" on voters' lists which he has said proves beyond doubt that the rolls are being tampered with to help BJP.The VP election has come prematurely after the controversial resignation by Jagdeep Dhankhar last month following an alleged confrontation with the govt over his decision to accept the notices to remove Justices Shekhar Yadav and Yashwant Varma.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge Saturday alleged that Dhankhar was biased against the opposition, but he took one independent decision and it led to his downfall, as he accused the Modi govt of pressuring constitutional authorities.The opposition has been accusing the governing BJP of attacking constitutional values, secularism, fair elections, marginalised sections, besides weakening the economy and endangering the future of the youth. Some feel that an ideal VP candidate from the opposition camp should be able to represent these issues and send out a strong message.Such a move by the opposition, insiders argue, will hammer home the ideological distinction between BJP and the opposition parties, and help rally the base as the latter looks to build upon its gains in the 2024 LS polls.However, ensuring unity with a consensus candidate will also be a challenge for the opposition camp, where many partners compete against each other and are antagonistic.In the first vice presidential election held after BJP assumed office in 2014, Congress and opposition had fielded Mahatma Gandhi's grandson and known intellectual Gopal Krishna Gandhi to take on BJP's M Venkaiah Naidu in 2017. However, when the opposition witnessed fissures in its ranks in 2022, there was a paucity of candidates and Congress was forced to field a party leader in Margaret Alva to take on BJP candidate Dhankhar.","Opposition may field a strong ""ideological"" face as candidate in the vice-presidential election.

Tejashwi Yadav's 'Name Missing' From Bihar Draft List Claim Prompts Forgery Probe By EC

‘EPIC cited by Tejashwi not used in 10 yrs’

NEW DELHI: A day after top RJD functionary Tejashwi Prasad Yadav claimed that a search of Bihar's draft electoral roll with his EPIC No. RAB2916120 had found his name missing, only to be ""fact-checked"" by the Election Commission that his name and actual EPIC No. RAB0456228 were very much included in the voter list, the poll panel on Sunday said it had failed to find any EPIC No. RAB2916120 issued by its authorised officers in its records.On Sunday, the electoral registration officer (ERO) concerned wrote to Tejashwi, saying that upon preliminary investigation, it appears that EPIC No. RAB2916120 flashed by him at a press conference in Patna on Saturday was not officially issued. The ERO asked the RJD scion to share the the EPIC card he cited at the press conference in original for a ""thorough investigation"".If found to be fake, there may be legal consequences, including an FIR.Sources told TOI that Tejashwi has been using EPIC No. RAB0456228 issued to him on March 18, 2014, which also appears in the latest draft electoral roll. It was this valid EPIC No. that he cited in his nomination papers/affidavit filed during the 2015 and 2020 assembly polls in Bihar.EPIC No. RAB2916120, which Tejashwi Yadav cited as ‘missing’ on Saturday, has not been used by him, at least for the past 10 years, said an EC source.In another case, EC has found that CPI(ML) Liberation MP Sudama Prasad’s wife Shobha Devi was registered as an elector from two different assembly constituencies (ACs) in Arrah, Bihar. The Left party is one of petitioners in the special intensive revision (SIR) case being heard by Supreme Court.Devi, as per documents seen by TOI, was registered with EPIC No. RGX3264140 at Lavarish Seva Kendra polling station in Arrah AC and under EPIC No. WVA0308544 at Samudayik Bhawan polling station in Agiaon AC. Her age cited in the two documents is several years apart.

NEW DELHI: A charter aircraft flying Rajasthan CM Bhajan Lal Sharma from Delhi to Phalodi on last Thursday (July 31) landed on a “wrong” airstrip at its destination. While the Falcon 2000 was to land at Phalodi Air Force Station, it landed at a civil airstrip of the city. Sources say the pilots realised their mistake and then took off from the civil airstrip to land the jet at the IAF station. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is probing this case and has taken the pilots off flying duty pending investigation.“The CM flew from Delhi to Phalodi on July 31 at 3 pm. The aircraft landed at the civil airstrip in Phalodi. The pilots immediately took off from the wrong airstrip and then landed at the Phalodi IAF station, which was the scheduled airport for it and about 5 km away from the former. The CM alighted there and a couple of hours later flew the aircraft to Jaipur. The Falcon 2000 then flew back to Delhi the same night,” said people in the know.The charter company filed a voluntary report on the “wrong airport landing incident” with the DGCA. The civil airstrip and the IAF station in Phalodi are about 5 km apart and both the facilities have similar geographical positioning. “Both the runways have similar orientation and visual characteristics.The flight crew misidentified the intended runway during approach. Seemingly there was inadequate pre-flight briefing about the presence of two airfields in close vicinity. Pilots must get proper pre-flight briefing and that is something operators need to work on to ensure such things don’t happen,” say sources. The Dassault Falcon 2000 is a French business jet that can carry 8-10 passengers with a range of upto 6,000 km.This case has raised concern as an aircraft supposed to land at the civil airstrip by mistake entering the restricted military airspace could have legal and safety consequences. “The civil airstrip may not support the aircraft’s weight category, compromising landing safety. Also, military-civil coordination may be lacking during such mis-landings, increasing response time for corrective action,” they add.The headquarters for the eponymous district, Phalodi is also called the “salt city” due to the salt industry in Rin. Phalodi is in the buffer zone of Thar Desert and close to Bikaner, Jodhpur and Jaisalmer.",Charter aircraft flying rajasthan cm bhajan lal sharma from delhi to phalodi landed on a “wrong’ airstrip at its destination.

'Jaw broken, spine injured': SpiceJet staff attacked by Senior Army Official; Video Goes Viral

NEW DELHI: An FIR has been filed against an Army officer posted in north Kashmir for allegedly assaulting and wounding four SpiceJet employees at Srinagar airport on July 26 after being asked to pay for carrying excess cabin baggage on Flight SG 386 to New Delhi. The wounds included a spinal fracture and serious jaw trauma, the airline said Sunday.The officer from High-Altitude Warfare School in Gulmarg unleashed what the airline called a “murderous assault” after refusing to pay the fee. The airline said he was carrying “two pieces of cabin baggage weighing a total of 16kg” — more than double the 7kg limit.He allegedly forced his way into the aerobridge without completing boarding formalities — a violation of aviation security protocols — and was escorted back by a CISF officer. At the gate, he turned violent.A video of the attack — showing the officer in jeans and a T-shirt kicking, punching, and hitting staff with a queue stand — has gone viral.“One SpiceJet employee collapsed unconscious on the floor but the passenger continued kicking and hitting the fainted employee,” the airline said. “Another staff member suffered bleeding from the nose and mouth after receiving a forceful kick to the jaw while bending down to assist the colleague who had fainted.”The four staffers were rushed to Bone and Joint Hospital and later referred to SMHS Hospital in Srinagar.Police registered an FIR based on the airline’s complaint. CCTV footage was secured from airport authorities and submitted to police. SpiceJet also started the process to place the officer — whose name and rank hasn’t been made public — on the no-fly list. “SpiceJet will pursue this matter to its fullest legal and regulatory conclusion,” a spokesperson said.Sources claimed the officer was traveling on emergency leave, mistreated by staff, and missed his flight. “He, too, has filed an FIR,” a source said.According to the Army, the case is under investigation. “Based on the outcome, further course of action will be decided,” it said.The defence PRO in Srinagar said: “Indian Army is committed to upholding the highest standards of discipline and conduct and takes all allegations seriously. Full cooperation is being extended to the authorities in investigating the case.”Relatives of the wounded airline staff expressed outrage. “We trusted the system and didn’t approach the media immediately. But we were shocked he was allowed to leave Srinagar the very next day,” one said Sunday.J&K police have not issued a formal statement. CISF said it “intervened promptly, managed the situation and ensured no disruption to flight operations”.SpiceJet has written to civil aviation ministry seeking action and urging a regulatory response.According to DGCA rules, the assault qualifies as Level 2 (physical abuse) and potentially Level 3 — life-threatening behaviour. A Level 2 offence can lead to a six-month flying ban. Level 3 carries a penalty of two years or more, with no upper limit.","An army officer posted in north kashmir allegedly assaulted and wounded four spicejet employees at srinagar airport.
