"Concept of ‘brain-dead’ unscientific, says petitioner: SC struggles to understand medical jargon, adjourns hearing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/concept-of-brain-dead-unscientific-says-petitioner-sc-struggles-to-understand-medical-jargon-adjourns-hearing/articleshow/123776993.cms,"NEW DELHI: Attuned to understand the legal jargons, a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Monday found it difficult to digest the medical terminology saturated arguments of a doctor who challenged the validity of the definition of brain-dead in the Transplantation of Organs and Tissues Act (THOTA), 1994.Appealing against a Kerala HC judgment, Dr S Ganapathy told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi that the concept of brain death and certification in India is unscientific and is violative of Article 21 of the Constitution. He said Sections 2(d) and 2(e) THOTA, relatable to brain death, are unconstitutional.Section 2(d) provided the meaning of ‘brain-stem-death’ as a stage when all functions of the brainstem have ceased permanently and irreversibly. Sec 2(e) provided that ‘deceased person’ means a person in whom permanent disappearance of all evidence of life occurs, by reason of brain-stem death or in a cardio-pulmonary sense, at any time after live birth has taken place.As he continued to explain brain-stem death, and its different meanings in different countries, Justice Kant-led bench said, “It is almost impossible for us to understand the medical terminologies you use. Why don’t you make a presentation on this before the National Medical Commission or experts from the health ministry?”“Ultimately, even if the court or the authorities accept your definition of bran-death, ultimately it would require the government to move a Bill in Parliament to amend the law.Can SC direct Parliament to amend a law? Will it not violate the Constitution-mandated separation of power,” the bench asked.Dr Ganapathy said organ transplant is the biggest business in India and only the poor patients are declared brain-dead to enable harvesting of the organs for other rich patients. “Why is it that hospitals declare only poor patients as brain-dead and not the kin of a SC judge, advocate or a rich and influential person,” he asked.The bench said, “If Parliament chose a definition of brain-death, the courts must accept it. We will not be able to change it even as the Supreme Court. You may argue that the brain-death definition given in the law is incomplete, but it is not an incorrect one.”When the court was about to dispose of the appeal, Dr Ganapathy said his earlier petition, challenging another order of the Kerala HC asking him to approach appropriate authority regarding malpractice in hospitals in declaring a person brain-dead, is pending since 2018 and requested that the present appeal be tagged with that one. SC gladly agreed to escape the medical jargon.","Dr s ganapathy challenged the validity of the definition of brain-dead in the transplantation of organs and tissues act (thota), 1994. He said sections 2(d) and 2(e) thota, relatable to brain death, are unconstitutional.

SC stays projects in proposed Goa tiger reserve,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-stays-projects-in-proposed-goa-tiger-reserve/articleshow/123776893.cms,"PANAJI: In a major setback to Goa govt's ambitious plans to start hinterland tourism activities in five sanctuaries, Supreme Court on Monday granted a stay on carrying out any development activities in the proposed tiger reserve areas in state.SC, hearing a special leave petition by the state govt challenging a July 2023 Bombay HC order directing the state to declare Mhadei wildlife sanctuary and its surrounding areas as a tiger reserve in three months, referred the matter to Central Empowered Committee (CEC) and sought a report within two weeks. The bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices K Vinod Chandran and A S Chandurkar said until the report is filed, and SC examines it, Goa govt would not carry out developmental work in the areas which are the subject matter of the Bombay HC order.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi arguing for Goa said if the 2023 order for designating wildlife sanctuaries - Mhadei, Bhagwan Mahavir, Netravali, Cotigao and Bondla - as a 1,000sq-km tiger reserve is implemented, the state would have to earmark one-third of its entire geographical area as a protected zone. ""If in one-third of its geographical area is earmarked as tiger reserve, tigers will roam the streets not human beings,"" Rohatgi said and faulted the HC order for taking recommendation of National Tiger Conservation Authority as gospel truth.In response to the court's query as to whether any steps were taken by forest department pursuant to NTCA's recommendation to the state govt to notify Mhadei-Cotigao wildlife sanctuaries as a tiger reserve, senior counsel Normal Alvares appearing for NGO Goa Foundation said the state responded positively to the recommendation and demarcated 745.18sq-km as tiger reserve, which is why the HC directed it to notify the tiger reserve within three months.Goa State Board for Wildlife has already outlined a proposed core zone of 587sq-km and a buffer zone of 167sq-km within the existing protected areas, where no relocation is required. Alvares told SC the areas for the proposed reserve were already notified as wildlife sanctuaries and national park and that not an inch of Goa's land outside the existing protected areas was to be notified as a tiger reserve as per the area already demarcated by forest department.The bench said this issue would require further examination by the CEC, whose assistance in fact finding is taken by the Supreme Court in environmental matters.",Supreme court grants a stay on carrying out any development activities in proposed tiger reserve areas in state.

AGRA: Semi high-speed trains Gatimaan Express and Vande Bharat, which usually run at 160 kmph, have been operating at a reduced speed of 130 kmph for over a year, largely due to the absence of the Kavach system on the Delhi-Agra rail route. The Railway Board had directed the speed reduction from 160 kmph to 130 kmph (maximum speed) until the automatic train protection system (Kavach) became operational.As per an RTI reply by Indian Railways to TOI, clarified: ""Train numbers 12049, 12050, 12001, 12002, 20171, 20172, 22469 and 22470 are currently being operated at a speed of 130 kmph.

""On June 24, the Railway Board issued a letter and stated the issue of speed of these trains was examined, and specifically mentioned three trains: 20171/20172 (Hzt Nizamuddin-Rani Kamalapati Vande Bharat Express), 22470/22469 (Hzt Nizamuddin-Khajuraho Vande Bharat Express) and 12049/12050 (New Delhi-Virangana Lakshmibai Jhansi Gatimaan Express).Gatiman is India's first semi high-speed train, launched in April 2016 to connect Delhi's Hzt Nizamuddin station with Agra Cantt in just 100 minutes, which runs between Nizamuddin and Jhansi.It used to run at a speed of 160 kmph between Delhi and Agra as tracks were laid there to suit the train's speed. In addition, trains 20171/20172 and 22470/22469 also used to run at 160 kmph between Delhi and Agra.Similarly, New Delhi-Rani Kamalapati Shatabdi Exp (12002/12001) used to run at 150 kmph between Delhi and Agra. The RTI stated the combined ""punctuality of these trains between April 1 and July 31 stood at 77.9%."" Giving details about the Kavach system in the Delhi-Agra section, the RTI added: ""ATP work is in progress in the Palwal-Bhuteshwar section of North Central Railway. Equipment has been installed, energised and RFID tags are fixed at the site. An Independent Safety Assessment (ISA) inspection has been done by the inspecting authority and the ISA report is awaited.

'Only Mistake I Made Was...': Prajwal Revanna Tells Court Before Life Sentence In Rape Case

Poll Do you think protests will effectively change the political situation in Punjab? Yes No

PATIALA: AAP MLA Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra has allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.According to Punjab Police sources, Pathanmajra and his accomplices fired at police officers during the escape and even ran over one personnel, leaving him injured.According to reports, Pathanmajra and his accomplices ran over police personnel with an SUV.The Sanour MLA was arrested a day after publicly criticising his party’s Delhi leadership.His detention in Patiala was linked to a rape case filed against him, sparking political uproar in the region.In a social media post, Pathanmajra claimed the case related to his former wife and alleged that the fresh charges of rape were politically motivated.“I was booked because I raised my voice against my own government, especially the Delhi leadership,” he wrote.His brother, Hardev Singh, said the MLA was taken into custody under Section 376 of the IPC despite already having been granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. “He was arrested from Dabri in Haryana in a case where bail was already granted. This is clearly an attempt to silence him,” he alleged.CIA Patiala confirmed that three weapons have been recovered and one accomplice of MLA Pathanmajra has been arrested.The arrested individual has been identified as Balwinder Singh, while the search for MLA Pathanmajra continues.Police said two officers were injured when stones were thrown at them during the MLA’s escape attempt.Authorities added that supporters of the MLA not only pelted stones but also opened fire at the police team.Before his arrest, Pathanmajra had appealed to colleagues and supporters via Facebook to protest outside the Patiala SSP’s office at the Mini Secretariat. He urged people to reach “in tractors, trolleys, and cars” to demand his release. “I will not be silenced even if more cases are registered against me. Will AAP’s Delhi leadership rule Punjabis now? Even Congress and BJP did not interfere to this extent,” he said.The MLA has repeatedly accused the party’s central leadership of sidelining Punjab leaders and “remote-controlling” the state. Recently, he criticised officials of the Irrigation Department over flood relief efforts in his constituency. Soon after, his security cover was withdrawn and police officers in the area were reshuffled — moves that raised eyebrows.“This is retaliation. They looted Punjab more than Abdali. Now they want to sell Punjab,” Pathanmajra declared.","Harmeet singh pathanmajra allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station.

NEW DELHI: A wildlife survey conducted in Arunachal Pradesh has brought out first-ever photographic evidence of the elusive Pallas’s cat in the state, reaffirming the eastern Himalayan terrain as a global biodiversity hotspot.The survey, conducted by WWF-India in association with the forest department of the Arunachal Pradesh government, also recorded the presence of other wild cats - snow leopard, common leopard, clouded leopard and marbled cat - above 4200 metres, indicating the landscape’s unique wild cat diversity.“The discovery of Pallas’s cat in Arunachal Pradesh at nearly 5,000 metres is a powerful reminder of how little we still know about life in the high Himalayas,” said Rishi Kumar Sharma, head-science and conservation, Himalayas programme, WWF-India.Pallas’s cat is one of the most elusive and rarely photographed wild cats, and remains one of the least studied feline species. Its documentation in Arunachal Pradesh extends the known distribution of the species in the eastern Himalaya, adding to earlier confirmed records from Sikkim, Bhutan, and eastern Nepal.Though WWF-India conducted the survey during July-Sept last year, its findings were released only recently.The organisation claimed to have deployed 136 camera traps in 83 locations across 2,000 sq km of rugged high-altitude rangelands in West Kameng and Tawang districts, making it one of the most extensive wildlife monitoring exercises.Besides getting photographic record of Pallas’s cat, the survey documented the highest elevation records for common leopard at 4,600 metres above sea level (masl), clouded leopard at 4,650 masl, marbled cat at 4,326 masl, Himalayan wood owl at 4,194 masl and grey-headed flying squirrel at 4,506 masl.WWF-India’s findings noted that the elevation records for these species were the “highest in India to dateand may exceed previously known global elevation limits”.“The discovery of Pallas’s cat in Arunachal Pradesh is a milestone for wildlife research in the eastern Himalayas. These findings reaffirm the state’s importance as a global biodiversity hotspot and highlight the need for continued investment in scientific monitoring and conservation,” said Ngilyang Tam, state’s principal chief conservator of forests and chief wildlife warden (wildlife and biodiversity).",First-ever photographic evidence of the elusive pallas’s cat in arunachal pradesh.

JAMMU/SRINAGAR: Aam Aadmi Party ’s J&K unit chief and Doda MLA Mehraj Malik was on Monday detained under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA) on charges of disturbing public order.While the unprecedented action came amid a massive protest against Malik, the lone AAP MLA in J&K Assembly, by govt employees across the district for allegedly using abusive language against Doda district’s deputy commissioner (DC) Harvinder Singh and using a social media platform to target him, the move drew condemnation from political parties, with CM Omar Abdullah describing it as an assault on democracy.“There is no justification for detaining Mehraj Malik under PSA. He’s not a threat to ‘public safety’ & using this discredited law to detain him is wrong. If the unelected govt can use its powers against an elected representative like this then how does anyone expect the people of J&K to continue to have faith in democracy (sic.),” Omar said in a post on X.AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal also took to X and asserted that the MLA would continue raising his voice for the people. “Is demanding a hospital for the people of your area such a grave crime that an elected MLA has to be thrown in jail for it? Mehraj Malik is the lion of AAP,” Kejriwal said in his post.BJP and Sikh bodies, however, had criticised the MLA’s abusive behaviour with public functionaries, terming him a “habitual trouble maker” and calling for action against him.PAS was previously invoked against a number of political functionaries in J&K, including former CMs Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, who were detained after the abrogation of Article 370 and held in prolonged custody under the Act, an administrative law that allows a person to be kept in preventive detention for up to two years without charge or trial.Malik, who was held at Dak Bungalow before being shifted to district jail, addressed his followers online, saying, “I am fighting for people’s rights. It is not my family’s fight, it’s the fight for my people.”The row erupted after a police case was registered against the MLA under BNS for removing medical equipment and drugs from a govt-run Ayushman Arogya Mandir, Health and Wellness Centre, in Kencha village. In a statement online, Malik said he had already submitted a request to the Doda chief medical officer to relocate the health centre, as demanded by the people, to a more suitable site. But, at Singh’s behest, an FIR was filed against him for theft, he alleged, accusing the DC of attempting to “favour the mafia”.Protesting govt employees condemned the use of derogatory language and baseless allegations against the DC, terming them as “unfortunate, deplorable and unacceptable”, and lauded the officer for his exceptional service, integrity and dedication to public welfare, especially in flood-hit hilly district. The protesters accused the AAP legislator of habitually hurling abuses at senior govt officers and provoking youths against the official machinery.","Mehraj malik was detained under the stringent public safety act (psa) on charges of disturbing public order.

Police have not issued any statement on the detentions so far.PDP president Mehbooba Mufti said her party would approach Hazratbal police station for the registration of an FIR against Andrabi for allegedly hurting the sentiments of Muslims by placing a plaque with the National Emblem inside the shrine.In a post on X, the former CM claimed PDP had approached “Nigeen police station” to file an FIR “but it was denied”. “I urge @JmuKmrPolice to initiate an FIR immediately given the gravity of the offence — deliberately hurting the religious sentiments of Muslims, thereby provoking them,” Mehbooba said. Her daughter, PDP representative Iltija Mufti, claimed, “Laws in Kashmir are being turned upside down on their head by being applied inversely. Instead of filing an FIR against the waqf chairperson for wilfully hurting religious sentiments of Muslims, police have caved in to her threatening orders by booking 50 civilians. No accountability for her hurtful irresponsible actions.”Andrabi, at the centre of controversy, is visiting shrines. On Sunday evening she visited Aasar-e-Sharif Jinab Sahib Soura Shrine Srinagar. After the visit she wrote on X, “Prayed for peace and harmony for all. Took stock of the ongoing construction works at the shrine campus, including the new grand mosque. Also reviewed facilities for devotees.”At the mausoleum of NC founder Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah on the latter’s 43rd death anniversary, NC politicians, including education minister Sakina Itoo, said the FIR in the case should be withdrawn and all “detainees should be released”. The minister sought action against the Waqf Board for “misusing the National Emblem”.J&K BJP spokesman Sajid Yousuf Shah said “whatever has happened at the Hazratbal shrine is debatable, whether a plaque with the National Emblem should have been there or not. But attacking the emblem and disrespecting the shrine is condemnable.” “Those who committed this heinous act are backed by political parties to divert public attention to hide their failures.” He said he expected “harsh punishment” for the culprits, “including those glorifying and shielding them”, and demanded that those who had “vandalised the Ashoka emblem must be booked under the PSA (J&K Public Safety Act). ”",Pdp president mehbooba mufti said her party would approach hazratbal police station for the registration of an fir against j&k waqf board chairperson darakhshan andrabi.

"Bihar SIR: Consider Aadhaar as valid ID document, SC tells EC; clarifies it's not a citizenship proof",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-sir-consider-aadhaar-a-valid-id-document-sc-tells-ec-clarifies-its-not-a-citizenship-proof/articleshow/123762607.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday directed the Election Commission (EC) to accept Aadhaar as the 12th prescribed document for establishing the identity of voters in the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in poll-bound Bihar.At present, Bihar SIR allows voters to submit 11 types of identity documents along with their enumeration forms.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi underlined that Aadhaar can serve as proof of identity but not proof of citizenship, news agency PTI reported. The EC, it said, must verify the genuineness of Aadhaar numbers submitted and ensure that only genuine citizens are added to the rolls, while excluding those using forged papers.“Nobody wants the EC to include illegal immigrants in the electoral roll. Only genuine citizens can vote,” the bench observed, asking the poll body to issue necessary directions during the day for Aadhaar’s acceptance.The court also sought the EC’s explanation on show-cause notices served to officials for refusing Aadhaar as identity proof.Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for the EC, argued that the demand for Aadhaar’s inclusion serves “no practical purpose” as 99.6% of the 7.24 crore voters on the draft roll had already submitted documents.The bench referred to the Aadhaar Act, 2016 and the Representation of the People Act, reiterating that Aadhaar cannot prove citizenship but can be used for identity verification.On September 1, while hearing pleas from political parties seeking an extension of deadlines, the Court was told by the EC that claims, objections and corrections to the draft rolls (published August 1) could still be filed beyond the September 1 cut-off, though they would be considered only after the final roll is published.The SC termed the confusion around Bihar’s SIR “largely a trust issue” and directed the state legal services authority to deploy paralegal volunteers to help voters and parties file claims and objections.As per the EC’s June 24 schedule, the deadline for claims and objections ended on September 1, and the final electoral roll will be out on September 30.Between August 22 and 30, the EC said, 22,723 claims for inclusion and 1,34,738 objections for exclusion were filed.",Justices surya kant and joymalya bagchi underlined that aadhaar can serve as proof of identity but not proof of citizenship.

Who is NDA bloc candidate Ponnusamy Radhakrishnan

An abrupt resignation and the need for new VP



Who is INDIA bloc candidate B Sudershan Reddy

The vice-presidential polls are set to take place on September 9 with INDIA bloc candidate B Sudershan Reddy all set to face NDA pick CP Radhakrishnan.Jagdeep Dhankhar stepped down on July 21, the opening day of the Monsoon session, citing health concerns. He has since stayed out of the public eye and had been residing at the Vice-President’s Enclave near Parliament House until recently.Meanwhile, Reddy has urged the MPs to “vote thoughtfully keeping the nation's interest above the party interest.”“Honourable Members...The election for the Vice-Presidential post is going to take place in 2-3 days. I earnestly request everyone to vote thoughtfully, keeping the nation's interest above the party interest,” he said.The BJP-led NDA holds a strong majority with around 422 projected votes, comfortably above the required mark. However, defections to the INDIA bloc could narrow the margin.Meanwhile, TMC, AAP and AIMIM have offered their support to Reddy. Moreover, BRS and BJD will abstain from voting in the polls.The vice president is chosen by members of both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, with nominated members of the Upper House also eligible to vote.At present, the NDA enjoys a clear advantage.Together, the two Houses have 786 members, accounting for six vacancies, one in the Lok Sabha (Basirhat, West Bengal) and five in the Rajya Sabha (four from Jammu and Kashmir and one from Punjab, following AAP MP Sanjeev Arora’s resignation after his victory in a state assembly bypoll last month). To win, a candidate must secure at least 394 votes, assuming full turnout.Dhankhar’s abrupt resignation on July 21, citing health reasons, sent shockwaves through Delhi’s political circles. With two years still remaining in his five-year term, Dhankhar became only the third vice president in history to resign before completing his tenure, after VV Giri and R Venkataraman. The timing of his exit, on the very first day of the Monsoon session of Parliament, raised eyebrows, and many speculated that the official explanation was masking deeper political undercurrents.Much of the intrigue centered on the curious sequence of events in the hours leading up to his resignation. Dhankhar remained active earlier in the day, chairing the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) at 12.30 pm, which was attended by senior leaders including JP Nadda and Kiren Rijiju. However, when the BAC had reconvened at 4.30 pm, neither leader showed up, and Dhankhar reportedly not was not informed in advance of their absence.Congress’s Jairam Ramesh seized on the episode, arguing that “something very serious” had happened between 1 pm and 4.30 pm. Speculation only deepened after Dhankhar’s final official act: permitting a motion for the removal of Justice Yashwant Varma of the Allahabad high court, an unprecedented move that had aligned with his history of sharp criticism of the judiciary.Meanwhile, political theories proliferated. RJD suggested that the resignation was part of a BJP strategy to sideline chief minister Nitish Kumar by pushing him toward the vice president’s office, a claim NDA leaders dismissed but one that had been widely discussed in poll-bound Bihar. The BJP, for its part, pushed back against opposition insinuations, with Nadda clarifying that both he and Rijiju had informed the vice president’s office about their inability to attend the BAC meeting. Yet, with unanswered questions about Dhankhar’s health, timing, and final acts in office, his resignation had become fertile ground for conspiracy theories and political maneuvering alike.","Jagdeep dhankhar stepped down on july 21, the opening day of the monsoon session.

However, past records of procurement scams suggest the rot may run much deeper.A closer scrutiny of the data reveals that in at least nine districts, procurement figures exceeded actual production reported in 2022-23. In Chhindwara, 7,628 tonnes of pulses were procured this year against a production of 3,074 tonnes in 2022-23. If accurate, this would mean the district's pulse production more than doubled in just a year.In Khargone, procurement reached 10,712 tonnes compared with 8,120 tonnes of output in 2022-23. Even in smaller districts like Umaria, Betul, Mandla, Dhar, and Satna, procurement exceeded last year's production - in some cases more than two-fold.Some districts that reported zero production in 2022-23 also showed procurement this year.In 2017, TOI reported how more pulses were procured than produced in Narsinghpur's Tendukheda block. At least 300 ""farmers"" who sold pulses worth Rs 7 crore could not be verified, leading to probe committees and demands for a CBI inquiry.
