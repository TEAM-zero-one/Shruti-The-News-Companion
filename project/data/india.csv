"India losing its sunshine to cloud cover, bad air: Study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-losing-its-sunshine-to-cloud-cover-bad-air-study/articleshow/124402640.cms,"Representative image

PUNE: If this year's prolonged monsoon and endless overcast skies have made it feel like the Sun has gone missing, there is data to back up the impression.In a new study by Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) and India Meteorological Department (IMD), among others, scientists have found that sunshine hours across most parts of India have been steadily declining over the past three decades - a trend linked to thicker cloud cover and rising aerosol pollution.The research, published in ""Nature's Scientific Reports"" this month, examined sunshine-hour data from 20 met stations across nine regions between 1988 and 2018. It found the annual sunshine hours - the duration when sunlight is strong enough to be recorded as a sunshine hour - have declined in all regions, except northeast where a marginal seasonal ""levelling off"" was seen.BHU scientist Manoj K Srivastava told TOI: ""On average, the west coast saw sunshine hours fall by 8.6 hours per year, while the north Indian plains recorded the steepest drop at 13.1 hours a year.""""The east coast and Deccan plateau also showed declining trends of 4.9 and 3.1 hours per year, respectively. Even the central inland region showed a loss of about 4.7 hours per year.""The study said sunshine increased between Oct and May - the drier months - but declined sharply from June to Sept, coinciding with the monsoon. The scientists associated with the study attributed the long-term ""solar dimming"" to higher aerosol concentrations - tiny particles released from industrial emissions, biomass burning and vehicular pollution.""These aerosols act as condensation nuclei, creating smaller and longer-lived cloud droplets that keep skies overcast for extended periods. This year's monsoon, too, has been marked by persistently cloudy skies across much of India, especially over the west coast, central India and Deccan plateau, which saw frequent overcast conditions even on days without rain. Though the study period spans till 2018, trends remain just as relevant today, as the same haze, humidity and cloud patterns persist - if anything, more strongly than before,"" one scientist said.""Higher aerosol numbers increase the residence time of clouds in the atmosphere, reducing the hours of sunlight reaching the ground,"" Srivastava said. The scientists said the decline in sunshine hours has major implications for solar energy generation, agriculture and climate modelling. While India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing solar markets, reduced solar incidence could affect power output and long-term planning for renewable infrastructure.","Sunshine hours across most parts of india have been steadily declining over the past three decades.

Serious issues with IHFL's financial transactions: ED to Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/serious-issues-with-ihfls-financial-transactions-ed-to-supreme-court/articleshow/124402436.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: The ED on Wednesday flagged serious irregularities in the financial transactions of Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd (IHFL), now known as Sammaan Capital Ltd, even as an NGO told the Supreme Court that the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) had condoned a litany of corporate governance irregularities by IHFL, brushing aside market regulator Sebi's adverse reports.Notwithstanding sneering objections to the allegations made by the NGO, Citizens' Whistleblowers Forum, from senior advocate Harish Salve, who was appearing for Indiabulls, a bench of Justices Surya Kant, Ujjal Bhuyan and N K Singh asked a 'responsible officer' from MCA to remain present with the original files of IHFL in court on Nov 19. ""We would like to see the original records of the ministry of corporate affairs relating to compounding of irregularities referred to by SEBI in its report. We would also like to know in which all cases you (MCA) have been so magnanimous in condoning corporate governance violations,"" the bench said.Additional solicitor general S V Raju, along with advocate A Venkatesh Rao, told SC ""there is something seriously wrong in this case."" The bench directed ED to clarify the stand taken by CBI in an affidavit that there was prima facie evidence of money laundering activities by IHFL.It also asked the ED to explain the steps taken by it pursuant to the CBI affidavit.For the NGO, Prashant Bhushan attempted to detail the allegedly surreptitious activities of IHFL in conspiracy with various realtors and banks. Salve termed the case as 'blackmail litigation' and said the petition was ""nothing but a cut-paste of another similar petition which was dismissed by the Delhi HC."" Salve said the entire loan amount advanced has been recovered, while A M Singhvi said seven agencies had investigated the cases against IHFL and given it a clean chit.Bhushan recalled that a Justice Kant-led bench had recently permitted CBI to register FIRs against seven realtors for abusing the subvention scheme to defraud homebuyers, and said Indiabulls, in criminal conspiracy with the Vatika group, has similarly defrauded flat buyers, with Sebi giving a detailed report on these and other irregularities by IHFL to MCA, which instead compounded 200 acts of misdeeds.The ED, in its probe status report, detailed the allegedly dubious deals of IHFL with Yes Bank and Dewan Housing Finance Corporation involving proceeds of crime (POC) worth Rs 5,333 crore; with Gautam Thapar-led Avantha group involving POC of Rs 307 cr; and with Americorp group that took loans worth Rs 9,480 cr from IHFL to invest in shares of Indiabulls to hike its price and earn profits worth Rs 532 crore.","The ed on wednesday flagged serious irregularities in the financial transactions of indiabulls housing finance ltd (ihfl), now known as sammaan capital ltd. an ngo told the supreme court that the ministry of corporate affairs (mca) had condoned a litany of corporate governance irregularities by ihfl.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124402469,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-844971,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

'Lack Of Trust' Opposition Slams EC Over Voter List Irregularities in Bihar

NEW DELHI: Raising questions about SIR in Bihar Congress has asked who the 30 lakh people who didn’t make it to the electoral rolls are and how many of them voted in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Congress said that as CEC had allowed applications for inclusion up to ten days before the last date of nomination, the final electoral roll must be frozen on that date, and elections be held on the basis of that list.The AICC expert group on elections and voters’ list, EAGLE, said the identity of the 30 lakh people removed was important as there were 7.7 crore registered voters in the parliamentary polls, but after SIR the number had come down to 7.42 crore.EAGLE, which comprises Ajay Maken, Digvijaya Singh, Abhishek Singhvi, Praveen Chakravarty, Pawan Khera, Gurdeep Sappal and Nitin Raut, said EC had claimed that 21.5 lakh voters were added in Bihar but Form 6 was available for only 16.9 lakh, which raises the question of “where the remaining 4.6 lakh forms are, and if these voters were added without due process”.",The identity of the 30 lakh people removed was important as there were 7.7 crore registered voters in the parliamentary polls.

NEW DELHI: Election Commission on Wednesday told Supreme Court that during the special intensive revision (SIR) of Bihar's electoral rolls, Aadhaar number of a person was accepted, according to SC's directive, as proof of identity but not as a document to establish Indian citizenship.Responding to an application filed by advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, seeking clarification to the effect that EC must not allow Aadhaar as proof of citizenship as it could enable illegal migrants to register as voters, the poll panel in a late evening affidavit said neither Aadhaar Act nor court orders permitted use of Aadhaar as proof of citizenship.""The commission is conscious of its responsibilities to ensure that the purity and integrity of electoral roll is maintained and only eligible persons as per Article 326 of the Constitution, that is those of 18 years of age and citizens of India and fulfilling residency requirements, are enrolled,"" EC said.On Sept 8, SC directed EC and its officials to accept Aadhaar as proof of identity for the purpose of inclusion or exclusion in the revised voter list of Bihar and to treat it as the 12th document for the purpose of identity verification purposes.In response to another application by Upadhyay seeking SIR of voters' lists of Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Puducherry where assembly elections are due next year, EC said it had already issued an order on June 24 stating SIR would be conducted for the entire country, the state-wise schedule for which would be issued separately in due course.","Election commission tells supreme court that during the special intensive revision (sir) of bihar's electoral rolls, aadhaar number of a person was accepted as proof of identity but not as a document to establish indian citizenship.

CHANDIGARH: The mystery over Haryana ADG Y Puran Kumar’s suicide lingered on Wednesday as the postmortem was deferred and rumours swirled around amid police’s silence on the contents of the nine-page ‘final note’ left behind by the IPS officer.Kumar’s wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, arrived in Chandigarh in the afternoon after cutting short her Japan trip as a member of CM Nayab Singh Saini’s delegation. She went to her official residence in sector 24 for a while. At 3pm, she left for the sector 11 house where Kumar allegedly shot himself with his gunman’s service revolver. From there, she headed for the mortuary in the sector 16 govt hospital where the IPS officer’s body awaits an autopsy.All this while, Amneet maintained distance from the media. When attempts were made to talk to her, she walked away with folded hands and in tears. In the hospital, she told officials present that she would “get justice at any cost”. She demanded a complete probe and told officials that she would not back down from any step to get justice, sources said.Officers said Amneet did not agree to the postmortem on Wednesday, and the autopsy, as well as last rites, will be conducted only after the couple’s elder daughter returns from the US on Oct 9.A police officer said Kumar had named at least seven serving and retired IPS officers in his final note, alleging that some seniors spoiled his ACR report and he faced unnecessary hurdles in promotion. He, however, did not name anyone specifically as the reason for his suicide, said sources, though he alleged that he was continuously harassed by officers of his own department. The note also spoke of his “stressful transfers” and “demeaning attitudes towards him” in social and professional environments.","Y puran kumar's wife, ias officer amneet p kumar, arrived in chandigarh in the afternoon after cutting short her japan trip as a member of cm nayab singh saini’s delegation.

What the court said



The outcome



Why the judgment matters



The broader context



The takeaway



A single high-value product does not automatically mean commercial intent.

Declaration rules must still be followed — non-declaration can attract penalties.

Customs authorities must base decisions on context and evidence, not assumptions.





On March 7, 2024, Mahesh Malkani, an Indian citizen living in Dubai, arrived at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport wearing a Rolex Submariner worth around AED 56,000 (approximately ₹12.7 lakh). Believing he had nothing dutiable to declare, Malkani passed through the Green Channel — reserved for passengers without goods requiring customs declaration.Customs officers, however, intercepted him, seized the watch, and issued a detention receipt. Officials claimed that Malkani had used the wrong channel and violated baggage rules. They further classified the single watch as a “commercial quantity,” implying it was intended for trade rather than personal use.Following the seizure, the Commissioner of Customs at IGI Airport issued an Order-in-Original on January 30, 2025. The order allowed Malkani to redeem the Rolex watch for re-export upon payment of the following:The order required Malkani to complete the redemption within 120 days. Instead of paying, he moved the Delhi High Court , challenging both the classification of the watch as “commercial” and the penalty terms.A Division Bench of Justices Pratibha M. Singh and Sahil Jain heard the case and delivered judgment on September 17, 2025.The High Court upheld the customs department’s right to impose a redemption fine and penalty but disagreed with the classification of the Rolex as a commercial consignment. The judges observed: “Clearly, this Court is of the view that one Rolex watch cannot be held to be a commercial quantity, and there is no reason why the same cannot be kept for personal use.”The bench noted that wearing a high-value watch during international travel does not, by itself, justify treating it as a commercial import. It emphasised that customs officials must take a practical view when distinguishing between personal and commercial use.While the court did not waive the fines or penalties, it extended the redemption deadline to October 31, 2025, thereby allowing Malkani additional time to reclaim his watch. The judgment effectively clears him to retrieve the Rolex after payment, while also reaffirming that the mere possession of an expensive personal item cannot automatically be equated with commercial intent.The High Court also strongly urged customs authorities to avoid arbitrary classifications in future cases, warning that such broad, blanket assumptions may not stand up to thorough judicial scrutiny.The decision clarifies an important grey area in customs enforcement: value alone cannot determine intent. A single high-end item, such as a luxury watch or jewellery, may still qualify as a personal belonging if it is clearly meant for personal use.Legal experts have welcomed the ruling as a sensible interpretation of customs law. Supreme Court advocate Dr. Sujay Kantawala said the judgment “underscores that customs must take a practical view of what counts as personal use versus commercial quantity.”The case also reflects broader judicial concern over how customs officers apply baggage rules, especially to international passengers carrying high-value personal goods.Under Indian customs regulations, travellers arriving from abroad are allowed to carry personal items and gifts up to a certain value without paying duty — currently around ₹45,000 (approximately AED 2,000). Anything beyond that must be declared at the Red Channel.Failure to do so can lead to detention, fines, or confiscation, even if the items are personal. Over the past year, courts have repeatedly reminded customs officials to exercise discretion, particularly when dealing with worn items such as watches or jewellery that are clearly for personal use.The Delhi High Court’s ruling sets a precedent for future customs disputes involving luxury items. It makes clear that:For travellers, the message is equally clear: when in doubt, declare. For customs, the case is a reminder that practicality and fairness must guide enforcement — not just the price tag on someone’s wrist.","Delhi high court rules single rolex watch worn by dubai resident is for personal use, not commercial import.

NEW DELHI: For the first time, India will establish an apex federal agency for planning and monitoring the entire transport sector, similar to institutions in developed countries. The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by PM Narendra Modi and attended by five cabinet ministers and their secretaries dealing with this sector.Sources said the agency — Gati-Shakti Transport Planning and Research Organisation (GTPRO) — will be set up within the cabinet secretariat and will be headed by a secretary-level officer to ensure better coordination. This move comes as the government aims at breaking down silos in transport infrastructure planning, which has seen over Rs 50 lakh crore invested in the past 11 years. The apex body, after gathering detailed data and research inputs, will initiate master planning and monitor progress.The government has also noted that current planning is primarily consultant-driven, with minimal collaboration among ministries and states. Also, there is no central agency responsible for policy advocacy or recommending changes to Acts and Rules to improve planning and project implementation.Sources added that there is no mechanism for mid-course correction in case of project failures.TOI on Sept 23 had reported the government’s plan to set up an apex empowered agency for preparation of comprehensive transport strategies for all modes of transportation and end-to-end mobility.Sources said that during the meeting, international best practices were discussed, including the Korea Transport Institute (KOTI), a think tank under the South Korean prime minister’s office that provides recommendations and alternatives for the nation’s transport policies. Other models from China, the United States, and Australia were also reviewed.“The PM has been vocal about breaking silos and moving towards integrated infrastructure planning. He emphasised the need for integrated transport planning to achieve maximum results. The necessity of such an ecosystem in India was discussed in detail, especially since there is currently no apex agency and each ministry has its own vision document. The absence of such a central body means there are no defined five-year or ten-year plans,” a source said.Though the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan framework has been in place, it has largely become a project appraisal platform. Moreover, multiple frameworks for project monitoring exist, but there is no agency tasked with recommending global best practices or innovative implementation methods.To start, the govt will constitute a Group of Transport Experts (GTE) from fields such as transport planning, supply chain management, data science, and network optimisation, with members drawn from IITs in Delhi, Chennai, BHU, and BITS Pilani. This group will provide technical support to the sectoral group of secretaries and suggest appropriate plans spanning five, 10, and 15 years.","For the first time, india will establish an apex federal agency for planning and monitoring the entire transport sector. The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by pm narendra modi. The agency — gati-shakti transport planning and research organisation (gtpro) — will be set up within the cabinet secretariat.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124396692,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-727257,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: Days after an advocate hurled a shoe at Chief Justice of India BR Gavai, Punjab Police on Wednesday registered several FIRs over objectionable social media post targeting Gavai.According to Punjab Police, the FIRs were registered after several complaints were received in various districts of the state against more than 100 social media handles.A Punjab Police spokesperson said social media content relating to attacks on high constitutional authority, caste-based vilification and incitement, public mischief with a direct attempt to disturb peace and public order by unjustly exploiting caste and communal sentiments has been flagged and FIRs have been registered in accordance with the law.The posts and videos in question contain casteist and hate-filled expressions intended to promote communal disharmony, disturb public order and erode respect for judicial institutions, said the spokesperson.""The contents of the social media posts included posts intended to provoke violence and erode respect for constitutional position, intentional intimidation and insult to a member of a Scheduled Caste (SC), attempts to promote enmity, hatred and ill-will against a member of SC category, promotion of enmity between groups on grounds of caste and intentional insult with the intent to provoke breach of peace and statements conducting to public mischief,"" the spokesperson said.""Further investigations in these FIRs are being conducted in accordance with the law,"" the spokesperson added.The contents of the social media posts included posts intended to provoke violence and erode respect for constitutional position, intentional intimidation and insult to a member of a Scheduled Caste (SC), attempts to promote enmity, hatred and ill-will against a member of SC category, promotion of enmity between groups on grounds of caste and intentional insult with the intent to provoke breach of peace and statements conducting to public mischief, said the spokesperson.On Monday, a 71-year-old advocate Rakesh Kishore allegedly attempted to hurl a shoe towards CJI Gavai during a hearing in Supreme Court .

Poll Do you agree with Jitan Ram Manjhi's plea for fairness in seat-sharing negotiations? Yes, it’s a reasonable request. No, he should demand more.

Rashmirathi

The Mahagathbandhan's not so 'dignified' proposal



What does Chirag want from NDA?



Tejashwi for CM, Tejashwi for CM not







A throwback to Nitish's flips but no flops



NEW DELHI: As Bihar gears up for another high-stakes assembly election, the political landscape is once again abuzz - not with Nitish Kumar 's next move - but with poetry, posturing, and power plays. From poetic pleas for justice to sharp rebukes over “dignity” in seat offers, alliance partners across the spectrum are flexing muscles and testing loyalties.In the NDA camp, Union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has invoked Dinkar’s Rashmirathi to press for a fair share, while in the Mahagathbandhan, Left allies are growing restless over what they deem “insulting” proposals. Amid the flurry of negotiations, one thing is clear — in Bihar’s shifting sands of coalition politics, every seat counts, and every word carries weight.Yet, beneath the poetic appeals and fiery rejections lies a deeper churn: the absence of a clear chief ministerial face, the confusion over leadership within alliances, and the persistent tug-of-war between old guards and rising heirs.Union minister and former Bihar chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi struck a poetic yet pointed note as he expressed his seat-sharing expectations. Hinting that his party, the Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM), had once aspired to contest half of the state’s 243 constituencies, Manjhi said he was ready to settle for 15 seats in the spirit of coalition unity.Taking inspiration from Ramdhari Singh Dinkar’s, he invoked Lord Krishna’s appeal for justice before the Mahabharata war, writing on X, “Ho Nyay Aagar To Aadha Do” — a plea for fairness seemingly directed at the BJP.Continuing in the same poetic vein, Manjhi added that if full justice was not possible, HAM would be content with “15 villages” — a metaphor for 15 constituencies — and would not “raise arms against kin,” underscoring his commitment to the NDA alliance. The statement came shortly after BJP leaders Dharmendra Pradhan and Vinod Tawde visited his residence to deliberate on seat-sharing.After putting up quite a show in the last assembly elections, the CPI (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation did not find the proposal to contest on 19 seats ""dignified"" enough. In 2020, CPI (ML) won 12 seats of the 19 contested.This time, it demanded 40 seats initially, later bringing it down to 30, PTI reported citing a party source. The party has kept ""all its options open"" in case its demands are rejected.""CPI(ML) rejected the offer as it was not a dignified proposal, and we are going to make a fresh proposal to fight around 30 seats. We are reducing the number of seats by almost 25 per cent,"" the source said.In 2020, RJD contested 144 seats and won 75, while the Congress contested 70 seats and won 19.Meanwhile, Congress’ central election committee is set to meet today to finalize its candidates.Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) president Chirag Paswan has made headlines for calling out Bihar administration, ruled by ally Nitish Kumar's JDU, on rising crime levels and his recent war cry of ""Abki baari, yuva Bihari,"" as unemployment remains major poll attack agenda of the opposition this time.It had left the NDA in 2020 over disagreements with chief minister Nitish Kumar, dealing a significant blow to the JD(U), despite managing to win only one of the more than 135 seats it contested.This time, while he has explicitly ruled out any CM ambitions, his party is eyeing specific constituencies considered favorable and has requested a few assembly seats in each of the five Lok Sabha constituencies it won in 2024, PTI reported citing a party source.Whether RJD patriarch is in ""dilemma between his sons and daughters"" or not, Congress has clearly stated its stance. Tejashwi Yadav could be RJD's CM face, but not INDIA bloc's, at least not for now.""Tejashwi Yadav may be CM face for RJD but INDIA bloc's CM face will be decided collectively,"" Congress leader Udit Raj said.This came after Tejashwi posted on X, a poster which implied him as the CM face: ""When Tejashwi becomes the CM, none of our brothers and sisters in Bihar household would be unemployed.""BJP was quick to catch on to this mocking Tejashwi saying that while ""he called Rahul Gandhi PM several times but Rahul Gandhi did not call him (CM candidate).""""He is presenting himself but people of his alliance are not saying the same. He called Rahul Gandhi PM several times but Rahul Gandhi did not call him (CM candidate). Let alone the alliance, now the situation is different even within the family. Lalu Yadav is in dilemma between his sons and daughters. There is a crisis in the family,"" BJP MP Sudhanshu Trivedi said.In the 2020 Bihar elections, Nitish Kumar led the NDA to a 125-seat majority. In August 2022, he broke with the BJP to form a government with the RJD-Congress-led Mahagathbandhan and became a key figure in the INDIA bloc.However, in January 2024, ahead of the Parliamentary polls, Kumar returned to the NDA, which now includes JD(U), BJP, Chirag Paswan’s LJP (Ram Vilas), Jitin Manjhi’s Hindustan Awami Morcha, and Upendra Khushwaha’s RLSP.This time, the NDA faces the INDIA bloc, led by Tejashwi Yadav, along with Congress, Left parties, Mukesh Sahani’s VIP, and newcomer Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj.Well, there's a saying in Bihar. No matter the poll outcome, the winner is always Nitish Kumar. Let's see if it holds true this time.","As bihar gears up for another high-stakes assembly election, the political landscape is once again abuzz.

Ladakh Statehood Violence: BJP Blames Congress While Sonam Wangchuk Says Gen-Z Led The Protests

SRINAGAR: The Leh Bar Association on Wednesday demanded Rs 1-crore compensation each for the families of four people killed in the September 24 firing in Leh and called for an impartial judicial inquiry headed by a retired Supreme Court judge into the incident.“All four victims belonged to poor families. Three were young, and the fourth was an ex-serviceman who had fought for the country in the 1999 Kargil War. We expect the government to provide adequate compensation,” Bar president Mohammad Shafi Lassu said at a press conference in Leh.“In Ladakh’s history, this is the first such incident. The deceased belonged to underprivileged sections,” Lassu said, while seeking interim cash compensation along with a government job for one member of each of the four families.He said the Bar supports the Leh Apex Body and Kargil Democratic Alliance’s demand for a Supreme Court judge-led probe. “It would signal that the government stands for a healing touch,” he said.Lassu said arrests have continued since Sept 24. “Even today, two people were arrested. Yesterday also, two persons were taken into custody,” he said, adding that they have filed bail applications on their behalf.He said of the 39 people arrested on Sept 24, bail has been granted to 38 so far.“Subsequently, around 40 more people have been arrested, and we are pleading their cases in court.”Lassu said the Bar is appealing to the government to stop these arrests. “We are Indian nationalists. Despite that, one of our leaders, Sonam Wangchuk, was arrested and lodged in Jodhpur. It is painful for us. These arrests should stop now,” he said.On September 24, police and paramilitary forces allegedly opened fire on protesters after their demonstration turned violent, killing four people and injuring more than 70.The protesters were demanding Sixth Schedule status and statehood for Ladakh. The Sixth Schedule status, enshrined in the Indian Constitution, aims to protect the rights and distinct cultural identities of tribal populations, ensuring their self-governance through autonomous district councils (ADCs).After the violence, authorities in Leh imposed curfew-like restrictions, suspended mobile internet, and arrested more than 60 people.The protests erupted while environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk, a member of the Leh Apex Body, was on a 35-day hunger strike at Martyrs’ Park that began on September 10 to press for restoration of “democratic rights.”After the clashes turned fatal, Wangchuk called off his fast. He was taken into custody on Sept 26 under the National Security Act.While the Ladakh administration has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the violence, the Leh Apex Body and the Kargil Democratic Alliance have rejected it, reiterating their demand for a judicial probe by a retired SC judge. The two groups also withdrew from talks with the Union home ministry’s high-powered committee scheduled for October 6, seeking Wangchuk’s release and an impartial investigation.","Leh bar association demands rs 1-crore compensation each for the families of four people killed in the september 24 firing in leh.

Country paid price with loss of lives repeatedly, says PM

NAVI MUMBAI: PM Modi said here on Wednesday that Congress should tell the nation who had caved in to foreign pressure and prevented India from mounting a military response to the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.Referring to a recent interview of P Chidambaram , PM Modi said, without naming him, ""A Congress neta, who has been Union home minister, has said India was ready to respond after 26/11, but because of the pressure exerted by some country, then Congress government stopped India's armed forces from attacking Pakistan. Congress must say who it was who took the decision... and who trampled on the sentiments of the country and of Mumbai. The nation has the right to know.""By doing so, the government in 2008 sent out a message of weakness and of surrendering to terror, Modi said. ""This strengthened terrorists and weakened national security.""PM Modi said, ""(As a result), the country had to pay the price for it with loss of lives again and again."" He made the remarks while addressing a gathering after inaugurating Phase One of the Navi Mumbai International Airport and the final stretch of Mumbai's underground Metro 3 line.PM Modi said, ""For our government, nothing is more important than the security of the nation and its citizens. Today's India strikes back with strength. Aaj ka Bharat ghar mein ghus ke maarta hain (India strikes deep inside the enemy's own territory). The world has seen this during Operation Sindoor.""Chidambaram , who had taken over as home minister just days after the 26/11 attacks, told a channel recently that after the Mumbai terror attacks, ""the whole world descended on Delhi to tell us 'don't start a war."" He said then US secretary of state Condoleeza Rice had met him and then PM Manmohan Singh to say India should not react. Chidambaram has since said he has been misquoted. Congress neta Manish Tewari however was quoted as saying that Chidambaram's remarks ""cannot be disregarded. ""The PM's attack on Congress comes after the opposition party's repeated questioning of his govt on US president Trump's claim that he used the threat of tariffs to get India and Pakistan to agree to a ceasefire in May.Describing the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) as a ""glimpse of Viksit Bharat"" that will help make Mumbai region Asia's biggest connectivity hub, Modi said, ""The long wait of Mumbai is over as the city has now got its second airport which will link Maharashtra's farmers and small industries to global markets."" The airport project was first announced in the 1990s and had since faced numerous delays.The inauguration event began with the PM's aircraft landing at the Navi Mumbai airport runway. The PM did a short walk through the new terminal 1 before addressing the gathering.PM Modi said India's airports had doubled from 74 in 2014 to more than 160, and the UDAN scheme had enabled millions to fly for the first time. The PM said that with the opening of the Navi Mumbai airport, the goal was to establish India as a major MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) hub by the end of the decade.He inaugurated Phase 2B of Metro Line-3 from Acharya Atre Chowk to Cuffe Parade, marking completion of the 33.5-km Aqua Line from Aarey to South Mumbai. Terming it ""a living symbol of a developing India,"" he praised the engineers who built it beneath the heritage precincts without disturbing historic structures.PM Modi said the Metro 3 line reminded him of the ""karnaamey"" (devious acts) of the opposition which ""likes to take development projects off the rails."" He accused the former MVA govt of halting the project. ""I participated in bhoompujan... At that time, lakhs of Mumbaikars had hoped that their (commuting) difficulties would be reduced.""",Pm modi said congress should tell the nation who prevented india from mounting a military response to the 26/11 mumbai terror attacks.

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party and Janata Dal (United)-led National Democratic Alliance in Bihar has hit a roadblock amid seat-sharing talks, with smaller allies making large demands as the assembly elections inch closer.Citing sources, news agency PTI reported that both BJP and JD(U) are likely to contest on 102 and 101 seats respectively to manage the demands of other allies. This is a sharp reduction in the seats of both the parties as BJP contested on 110 seats in 2020 assembly elections, while JD(U) contested on 115 seats.Meanwhile, Chirag Paswan's LJP (RV) has convened an emergency party meeting at its Patna office on Tuesday to discuss the Bihar Assembly elections ""A meeting has been called by the party's in-charge, who has also been given the responsibility of election in-charge. This meeting will be held under the leadership of our state president Raju Tiwari. In the coming days, discussions will take place regarding election strategies, seats, and candidates.

Moreover, senior leaders in the party are of the opinion that the party should get at least 45 seats, a party leader said on the condition of anonymity.In the 2020 elections, Paswan walked out of NDA and contested separately, winning just one seat but damaging the JD(U) in dozens of constituencies and contributing to chief minister Nitish Kumar's party posting its lowest tally in two decades, 43.Additionally, another NDA ally HAM also demanded at least 15 seats to contest. After his poetic dig at BJP, former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi asserted that ""My party would prefer not to contest polls if we don't get a respectable number of seats. But, I must make it clear that even if we don't contest polls, our party will keep working for the NDA partners.""Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, along with other senior BJP leaders, had earlier met Manjhi also to discuss the seat-sharing arrangements.Meanwhile, Pradhan, along with Vinod Tawde, met party leaders in Patna to discuss the seat-sharing arrangements and finalise the list of party candidates.Talking to reporters, BJP MP Sanjay Jaiswal said, ""Everything is fine within the NDA.

Bail rejected to doctor who prescribed ‘killer’ syrup

BHOPAL: The first cases of children’s deaths in Madhya Pradesh after consuming cough syrup were reported on September 3, but it was only on September 16 that the administration recognised the severity of the situation and began a survey to check children’s health in Parasia block of Chhindwara district.The exercise gained pace two days later, after Nagpur hospitals alerted authorities about multiple child deaths due to renal failure. However, medicine samples were collected only after September 26, when a biopsy report from Nagpur’s Government Medical College and Hospital revealed “acute tubular injury” in one of the deceased children.Officials said during the initial public hearings, the administration came across several similar cases of renal failure among local children. An alert on September 18 from Metropolitan Surveillance Unit, a centralised public health facility to monitor, control and prevent disease outbreaks, further strengthened suspicion, prompting intensified screening. “At that time, the exact reason was not known, but the pattern suggested a possible toxin-induced illness,” said an official.A team from the state headquarters was sent to Parasia, and biological samples were dispatched to NIV Pune, which ruled out viral infections.The Nagpur biopsy report on September 24 confirmed that the deaths were due to renal failure, though the reason for kidney damage remained uncertain. The rapid progression of symptoms indicated chemical poisoning.Joint teams from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation and MP Food and Drugs Administration collected syrup samples between September 26 and 29. Nineteen medicines used for the affected children were tested. Initial reports on October 1 and 3 found all samples of standard quality, but subsequent tests revealed that Coldrif cough syrup was substandard.Two more syrups — Respifresh TR and Relife — were also found below standards. Following confirmation from Tamil Nadu that Coldrif contained 48% diethylene glycol (DEG), a highly toxic chemical causing acute kidney failure, a state-wide ban was imposed on October 4.A district court in MP on Wednesday rejected bail to Dr Pravin Soni, the government pediatrician accused of prescribing contaminated cough syrup to children during his private practice.","The first cases of children’s deaths in madhya pradesh after consuming cough syrup were reported on september 3.
