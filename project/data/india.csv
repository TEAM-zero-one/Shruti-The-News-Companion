HIV jab for 115 nations rests on Indian regulators,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hiv-jab-for-115-nations-rests-on-indian-regulators/articleshow/124199149.cms,"Mumbai: There will be a dramatic shift in how the world prevents HIV and the timelines depend on how quickly Indian drug regulators act. A US-based pharma giant has granted royalty-free licences to four Indian generic manufacturers to produce lenacapavir, which prevents transmission by almost 100%, at $40 per person per year, roughly 0.1% of the original cost.Lenacapavir is an injectable drug whose protection from one jab lasts six months. The licensed manufacturers by Gilead Sciences include Dr Reddy's, Hetero, Emcureand Mylan. The first two have announced their pricing. The drugs are estimated to roll out in 2027. But, it could be much sooner or delayed, and what happens in India will impact local access as well as 115 low- and middle-income countries as these firms will be key exporters. Twenty-six additional such countries where people participated in crucial clinical trials are excluded from it as per licence terms.The exports depend on registration and a certificate of pharmaceutical product from Indian FDA. Besides, there could be regulatory demand for local clinical trials despite strong phase-3 trial data from elsewhere. ""In that case, the delays could spill over into 2027,"" said Leena Menghaney, public health lawyer.There is another pathway to faster access. FDA could provide a waiver for local clinical trials on the grounds that HIV is an epidemic. India reports more than 60,000 new HIV infections annually.There is precedent for such a move. ""Waivers have been given for HIV and TB drugs. These decisions are based on the results of phase-3 clinical trials in countries with very strong regulatory systems,"" Menghaney said.In 2015, the apex committee of the regulator Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation also granted a waiver of local trials for antiviral drugs against Hepatitis C.Even if local production moves ahead quickly, access in India will be limited. National AIDS Control Organisation (Naco) has so far included only condoms as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in its HIV prevention programme.There have been drugs similar to lenacapavir, although not on a par in terms of protection and cost, that were not included in the national programme. Naco officials had previously defended this position, saying condoms also help prevent the spread of other STDs and STIs, which increased in some countries when PrEP was introduced and condom use declined.However, Dr Ishwar Gilada, an HIV specialist, said, ""Bringing about behaviour change is difficult, but sex education and awareness are also part of Naco's responsibilities. For the first time in over 40 years, we have a way to control HIV's transmission by almost 100%. This will reduce the number of people requiring lifelong treatment.""Ganesh Acharya, a city-based HIV-TB survivor, said, ""Other such drugs so far have been needed to be taken monthly, are costly and offer relatively lower protection. Even condoms carry a risk of tearing. This drug could bring down new HIV numbers.""","Lenacapavir is an injectable drug whose protection from one jab lasts six months.

Sonu Sood Questioned For Nearly Seven Hours By ED In Betting App PMLA Case

NEW DELHI: With some celebrities, including former cricketers and filmstars, not appearing despite summonses being issued to them in connection with alleged laundering of illegal proceeds of 1xBet online betting platform, ED is considering attaching properties of those linked to cases in which money trails have been established.ED is also likely to soon file a chargesheet in the case, wherein these celebrities may also be named as accused for endorsing illegal activities, sources said.On Sept 24, actor Sonu Sood had appeared before ED at its headquarters for questioning in connection with his alleged association with the 1xBet online betting syndicate. Earlier, cricketers Suresh Raina, Shikhar Dhawan, Robin Utthappa and Yuvraj Singh, and actor and ex-TMC MP Mimi Chakraborty had appeared before the agency and recorded their statements regarding fees received for endorsing illegal betting activities. Actor Urvashi Rautela, who missed the summons issued to her, has been asked to appear for questioning in the same case.The agency is probing the promoters and associates of 1xBet for illegally running a betting and gambling racket in the country and siphoning the proceeds of crime out of India. Attachment of assets in foreign countries is also likely where the agency has found trails of proceeds of crime. Earlier, in the case of Fairplay, another illegal betting app, the enforcement agency had attached assets worth over Rs 307 crore in Dubai, including land, villas and bank balances, linked to the accused.Fairplay was allegedly involved in illegal broadcast of cricket matches, besides online gambling.Among several FIRs registered against Fairplay, one by Viacom18 Media Pvt Ltd in Mumbai accused the betting app of causing loss of revenue of more than Rs 100 crore by illegally broadcasting cricket matches.","Ed likely to name celebrities as accused for endorsing illegal betting activities.

in 2023 to

modifiable risk factors

NEW DELHI: The incidence of cancer in India has gone up by 26%, from 84.8 per 1 lakh population in 1990 to 107.2 in 2023, according to a new study. Published in The Lancet, it shows deaths due to cancer increased by 21% during this period, despite advances in treatment.In comparison, both incidence and mortality have declined significantly in US and China over the 33-year period. The reason behind this is strong tobacco control, universal vaccination and organised screening in these two countries, Dr Abhishek Shankar, radiation-oncologist at AIIMS Delhi, said.India, he added, continues to fare poorly on both counts because of persisting risk factors such as high use of tobacco, obesity and infections, coupled with limited access to early detection.Evidence-based strategies like HPV and Hepatitis-B vaccination, mammography, lung cancer screening with low-dose CT, and colonoscopy screening, and timely treatment remain uneven or inadequate.For India to reverse its trajectory, we must urgently strengthen risk prevention strategies, expand evidence-based screening programmes and integrate cancer care into its universal health coverage agenda,"" Shankar said.The study's lead author Dr Lisa Force from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), University of Washington, said, ""Cancer remains an important contributor to disease burden globally and our study highlights how it is anticipated to grow substantially over the coming decades, with disproportionate growth in countries with limited resources.""She added that despite the clear need for action, cancer control policies and implementation remain under-prioritised in global health, and there is insufficient funding to address this challenge in many settings.The study shows cancer incidence has declined by 19% and 20% in China and the US, respectively, between 1990 and 2023, while their mortality rates attributable to cancer has also seen a robust decline - 43% decline in mortality due to cancer in China and 33% in the US.The study estimates that 42% (4.3 million) of the estimated 10.4 million cancer deaths in 2023 were attributable to 44 potentially modifiable risk factors - presenting an opportunity for action.""Behavioural risk factors contributed to the most cancer deaths across all country income levels in 2023, especially tobacco use which contributed to 21% of cancer deaths globally. Tobacco was the leading risk factor in all country income levels except low-income countries, where the leading risk factor was unsafe sex (linked to 12.5% of all cancer deaths),"" the study said.A parliamentary committee report tabled in 2023 suggested raising taxes on tobacco products in India to make them less affordable.""Committee recommends the ministry (health) to pursue with the department of revenue to expedite the decision on raising taxes on tobacco products,"" it said.It also stressed upon the need to link the Population-Based Cancer Registry to Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission to get real time data on cancer patients.The mission is a key health initiative by the govt which aims at providing digital health IDs for all Indian citizens to help hospitals, insurance firms, and citizens access health records electronically when required.Most cancer cases in India are detected in late stages leading to poor prognosis.The parliamentary committee suggested that the issue of screening for cancer should be taken up at 'Jan Aandolan Pace', a mass movement to fight against cancer by timely screening.""A day in a month may be fixed for cancer screening on the lines of reproductive and child health,"" the parliamentary committee suggested.","The incidence of cancer in india has gone up by 26%, from 84.8 per 1 lakh population in 1990 to 107.2 in 2023.

Minor tracked target's movement for 15 days

NEW DELHI: It was an almost decade-long vendetta that led to the murder of 56-year-old property dealer Lakhpat Singh Kataria in south Delhi's Malviya Nagar, police said on Sunday. A father-son duo has been nabbed for the crime after a 48-hour manhunt aided by CCTV analysis, technical surveillance and human intelligence, cops said.The man arrested for Kataria's murder has criminal antecedents, special commissioner (law and order) Ravindra Yadav said. He had filed an FIR against Kataria in 2016 following a brawl that he claimed left him bedridden for nine months. The son was just nine at the time. They nurtured the grudge for nine long years and finally attacked Kataria last week.The suspect, 47, roped in his 17-year-old son for the murder, deliberately timing the act a day before the boy's 18th birthday so that he could benefit from juvenile laws.On the day of incident, the father-son duo first attacked the victim with a cricket bat and fired multiple shots at him inside Vijay Mandal Park, Malviya Nagar. Singh was declared brought dead at AIIMS.At the crime scene, cops found bloodstains scattered across the park, along with a broken cricket bat handle and the bat itself. A case under Sections 103 (murder) and 3(5) (common intention) of BNS)and Sections 25/27 of the Arms Act was registered at Malviya Nagar police station.Deputy commissioner of police (South) Ankit Chauhan said, ""Around 650 CCTV cameras across a 55km stretch were scrutinised to track the movements of the assailants, who had arrived on a black Hero Splendor with no number plate. ""The accused waited outside the park and chased the victim inside, where they murdered him. After the incident, they escaped towards Outer Delhi using multiple routes.The CCTV analysis, combined with call detail records (CDRs), pointed towards the involvement of a 47-year-old man residing in Auchandi village, Chauhan added. His mobile phone was switched off during the relevant period, further raising suspicion. Police teams then apprehended his minor son, who led them to his father.Police have seized the motorcycle used in the crime. The accused has four FIRs registered at Malviya Nagar police station between 2006 and 2016, involving charges of attempt to murder, assault, criminal intimidation, and extortion.During interrogation, the accused revealed that the motive stemmed from a violent clash in 2016. At the time, Lakhpat Singh and his associates had allegedly assaulted the accused over a property dispute. A case was then registered against Singh and his brother, while a cross-case was filed against the accused and his family.""He has disclosed that he instigated his 17-year-old son to join him in the plan, timing the execution a day before the boy's 18th birthday to exploit juvenile laws. The accused deputed his son to recce the victim's morning routine and then arranged a country-made pistol,"" DCP Chauhan added.The son had come to stay with a relative in the area about 15 days before the incident and closely tracked the victim's movements. He noted that Singh regularly went for morning walks in Vijay Mandal Park. On Sept 25, he shared this information with his father, and together they executed the plan next morning. On Sept 26, the duo, with faces covered, arrived on a motorcycle without a number plate and executed the murder.","Property dealer lakhpat singh kataria, 56, was shot dead in south delhi last week.

CHENNAI: Chaotic images from a political rally in Karur, Tamil Nadu, show massive crowds packed along the 2 km stretch from the Karur-Trichy highway roundabout to the Karur-Erode highway on Saturday evening.Supporters and party workers surrounded actor-turned-politician Vijay’s campaign vehicle, with many women, children, and young girls among the attendees. Cadres stood dangerously close to the vehicle, according to the images.The gathering quickly turned chaotic, triggering panic and a stampede. Several attendees fainted and were rushed to nearby hospitals.At least 39 people, including 10 children and 17 women, were killed, while 81 were hospitalised, many with serious injuries.Witnesses said the stampede began shortly after Vijay started his speech, when disturbances in the crowd caused panic. The actor appealed to the crowd and police to remain calm before cutting his speech short and leaving the venue.Survivors described floodlights failing, parents searching for missing children, and people trapped under two-wheelers and barricades. Some even climbed rooftops to help others, but the structures collapsed, worsening the situation.In response to the tragedy, Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin announced an inquiry commission, headed by retired judge Justice Aruna Jagatheesan, to investigate the incident.

NEW DELHI: The main accused in the recent BMW accident case, in which a senior finance ministry official had died, was granted bail on Saturday after a court noted that CCTV footage placed the prosecution's allegations on a ""fragile foundation"".Gaganpreet Makkad (38) has been accused of hitting the Navjot Singh's bike from behind, killing the 52-year-old and injuring his wife.Judicial magistrate first class Ankit Garg said that while the FIR stated that the car directly struck the motorcycle from behind, the footage did not support a straightforward, deliberate high-speed ramming of the bike. Instead, he pointed out, the footage showed that Makkad's car lost control, struck the divider, flipped and, while flipping, came into contact with a DTC bus and the motorcyclist. The people on the motorcycle then hit the bus alongside them and the pillion rider fell in front of the BMW car while its driver was crushed beneath it, the court noted.Stating that while Delhi Police invoked Section 105 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the court said the footage brought the occurrence closer to rash or negligent driving, premised on the mode of collision.The DTC bus continued to drive without caring for the impact of the accident, the court noted, adding that the footage had introduced intervening factors such as the conduct of the bus and that of an ambulance driver and a paramedic who had arrived at the spot within seconds of the accident but left almost immediately.Pulling up the ambulance driver and the paramedic for not showing humanity and failing in professional duty, Garg said the primary golden-hour lapse happened because of them. Denouncing their ""highly unprofessional and unethical"" conduct, the court said that despite being first on the scene, they provided no aid and left. When they approached the scene, the motorcyclist was unconscious beneath the car, but they left within roughly 40 seconds - the first to leave the spot - without checking Singh's pulse or administering first aid, the judge pointed out.On the allegation of the injured deliberately being taken to a faraway hospital, the court said whether Makkad was trying to help the victim or create evidence in her favour was a question for investigation and trial.Dismissing the prosecution's argument for extending Makkad's police custody as ""academic"", the judge said no such application was made till now. Underlining the judicial precedents, according to which there is a presumption of innocence in favour of the accused and that bail is the norm, jail is the exception, the judge granted Makkad bail.The relief is subject to furnishing a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh along with two sureties of the same amount. The court also imposed other conditions, including surrendering her passport and not contacting any witness.","Gaganpreet makkad (38) has been accused of hitting the navjot singh's bike from behind, killing the 52-year-old and injuring his wife.

NEW DELHI: An image of Jesus Christ inside a 'Vatican City-themed' Durga Puja pandal in Ranchi was replaced on Friday with that of Lord Krishna.The development came following objections raised by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). The VHP alleged that the marquee, organised by R R Sporting Club at Ratu Road, was made to ""hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus"" and encourage conversion. The organisers had rejected these charges earlier on Thursday.The club’s patron Vicky Yadav said the decision was taken by the puja committee members and not due to protests by any section, reports news agency PTI. “It was not due to the protest by a certain section but by our committee members to show all religions on the same platform,” he said. He said that European-style statues placed outside the pandal were retained.Yadav claimed that the design aimed to promote peace and brotherhood. ""India stands for religious harmony. If that doesn’t exist, then why not just declare this a Hindu nation?"" he asked, showing videos of Prime Minister Narendra Modi visiting churches abroad during official trips.He said the idea was inspired by India’s multi-faith culture and that the club promotes Sanatan Dharma..""We have been organising Durga Puja for the last 50 years, and every year we make pandals based on certain themes. This year, we decided to replicate the Durga Puja pandal made by Sreebhumi Sporting Club in Kolkata in 2022 on the theme of Vatican City,"" Yadav said.VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal had expressed concern on Thursday on X, saying, ""This has been done with an objective to hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus and aimed at encouraging religious conversion. If the organising committee of this Durga Puja pandal is so interested in secularism, I would ask them to display a photograph of a Hindu God or Goddess at any event organised by the Church or at Madrasas in Ranchi.

TVK president Vijay was supposed to arrive at the rally between noon and 1pm. But by the time he reached the spot, it was 7pm. As a result, the crowd had swelled, way beyond the venue at Velusamypuram could hold. Fans and cadres had assembled at the venue from 11am, transforming the place into a carnival as songs were played. Since it was a weekend, women too visited the spot with children. As the evening approached, scores of workers from textile, mosquito net making units and others who had completed their shifts started gathering at the spot.""Saturday is payday for the workers. So attendance in the units would be high, which in turn resulted in higher turnout at the rally venue,"" S Vijayan, a social worker from Thavittupalayam, said.Add to this the frenzied fans of Vijay following him from Namakkal, his earlier campaign spot. The four lanes of Karur-Erode stretch at Velusamypuram was packed by 5pm. Scores of youths on bikes and cars who followed Vijay from Namakkal joined this crowd.""The infusion of cadres and fans that tailed the actor's vehicle further created congestion,"" a police officer said.Also read: TVK rally tragedy: Long delay, overcrowded what we know so far Unlike other political rallies where a dedicated place is cordoned off for the neta's campaign vehicle to halt, TVK's rally at Karur had no such spot for Vijay's vehicle. The last straw was when Vijay's campaign vehicle waded through the crowd, displacing those on the road towards both sides. This, in turn, squeezed others who were on the sides, triggering a commotion.As frenzied crowd spilled into a shed accommodating generator powering floodlights, thus disrupting power supply, darkness created the first wave of chaos. People pushing each other caused families moving in different directions, missing their kin. Women raised alarms to save their children who got lost in the crowd.""A part of a tree in front of a commercial complex broke and fell over a shed, causing people, mostly youths, to fall on women and children standing below,"" said an eyewitness.Police say the deaths were from two different spots, one about 50m from Vijay's campaign vehicle and the other few metres away.""Many people died on the spot. Vijay and TVK functionaries threw water bottles, assuming that people had fell unconscious,"" said N Devi, a resident of Veluswamypuram.Darkness made people run helter-skelter to find a safe zone, and the rush caused a stampede between 7 and 7.30pm. All this while, blaring speakers played high decibel songs, unaware of the tragedy unfolding.Also read: TVK rally tragedy: Stampede-like situation at Vijay's Karur rally; at least 10 dead & 30 injured TVK had sought permission to hold the meeting at Karur lighthouse roundabout or Uzhavar Sandhai, citing a crowd of 10,000 people.

"Amit Shah rejects Naxals' truce offer, vows menace will end in March",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amit-shah-rejects-naxals-truce-offer-vows-menace-will-end-in-march/articleshow/124200346.cms,"NEW DELHI: While underlining that the March 31, 2026 deadline to end armed Naxalism would be met, home minister Amit Shah has rejected the recent ""misleading"" statement by CPI(Maoist) offering to lay down arms and seeking a ceasefire, saying there shall be no ceasefire at the security forces' end.""For those who wish to surrender, no ceasefire is required. Lay down arms, the police will not fire a single bullet at you...you will, in fact, be re-established (rehabilitated),"" he said, while addressing the valedictory session of 'Bharat Manthan 2025: Naxal Mukt Bharat' conclave, organised by the Syama Prasad Mookerjee Foundation, here on Sunday.While stressing that armed Naxalism will end in Mar 2026, the home minister warned that the fight against Left-wing extremism (LWE) will not be over until elements in civil society offering it ideological, legal and funding support are identified, understood and weaned off.Shah took a dig at Left parties for ""jumping"" at and endorsing the CPI(Maoist) ""ceasefire offer"", asking them why their sympathies, and those of a section of civil society and the media, lie with the Maoists who engage in wanton killing of innocent tribals and block development and welfare initiatives, infrastructure works, education and governance in 'Red corridor' areas. ""Why are your thoughts selectively with the Maoists and not with their victims?"" he asked.Recalling the rise of Maoist forces, he said that while the influence of People's War Group (PWG) had spread across several states, it somehow ended in West Bengal the day the Left came to power in the state. He indicated that this was no coincidence. Talking of the CPI(Maoist) vision of creating a Red corridor from 'Pashupati to Tirupati', he said 17% of the country's area was once under the influence of Naxalism, compared to 3.3% hit by insurgency in the Northeast and 1% by terrorism in J&K.Taking a dig at Maoist sympathisers in civil society - often labelled as 'urban Naxals' Shah said: ""Those who write articles sympathising and siding with the violent Maoists who reject the Constitution, legal processes and democratically elected govts, please rise above ideology and put the nation first. The governance vacuum in LWE-hit areas is not the cause of armed Naxalism but the result of Maoists blocking development and welfare activities from reaching the poor tribals for several decades. ""The home minister shared that in the past two years of BJP rule in Chhattisgarh, 2,106 Maoists had surrendered, 1,770 Naxalites were arrested and 560 were neutralised . He underlined that a comparison of the ten-year regime of the Manmohan Singh govt (2004-2014) and ten years of rule by Narendra Modi govt (2014-24) showed that fatalities of security forces were down by 73% and that of civilians by 74% in LWE areas.Stating that the ""scattered"" and ""response-driven"" approach of previous regimes was replaced by the Modi govt with a ""unified and ruthless"" strategy, Shah said: ""Those who lay down arms and surrender will be given a red-carpet welcome. But for those who continue to use arms to kill civilians, it is my govt's duty to confront them and defend the innocent...This is our no-confusion policy, and we have given a free hand to the Central forces and state police, while choking the Maoists' arms supply lines and funding. ""Thanks to targeted operations by uniformly trained Central and state anti-Naxal forces, forensic investigations, location and mobile tracking, social media analysis of Maoist supporters and resistance to the media narrative in Maoists' favour, 108 senior Naxalites had been neutralised in the past two years, he added.","Home minister amit shah rejected the recent ""misleading"" statement by cpi(maoist) offering to lay down arms and seeking a ceasefire.

""This Vijayadashami is special for another reason,"" he said. ""This day marks 100 years of the foundation of RSS. This journey of a century is as amazing and unprecedented as it is inspiring. When RSS was founded 100 years ago, the country had been bound by the chains of slavery for centuries. ""In his I-Day address, Modi had said for the past 100 years, RSS swayamsevaks (volunteers) have dedicated their lives to fulfilling the resolve of ""vyakti nirman"" (character development) and ""rashtra nirman"" (nation building) for the welfare of ""matrubhoomi"" (motherland).Centuries-long slavery had deeply hurt the country's self-respect and self-confidence, and the world's oldest civilisation was facing an identity crisis. ""Our countrymen were becoming victims of an inferiority complex,"" Modi said. ""Therefore, along with the country's independence, it was also important that the country be freed from intellectual slavery. In this context, the most revered Dr Hedgewar began to ponder over this issue.For this herculean task, he founded RSS on the auspicious occasion of Vijayadashami in 1925.""The PM further said, ""After Dr Saheb's passing, Param Poojya Guruji carried forward this great yagya of service to the nation. Param Poojya Guruji used to say, 'Rashtraya Swaha, Idam Rashtraya Idam Na Mam', meaning, 'This is not mine; this belongs to the nation'.""Modi noted that the resolve of RSS founders had inspired countrymen to rise above self-interest and embrace dedication to the nation. ""This statement by Guruji Golwalkar has shown millions of volunteers the path of sacrifice and service."" The PM said the spirit of sacrifice, service, and the discipline it inculcates among its members are the true strengths of Sangh. ""Today, RSS has been relentlessly and tirelessly engaged in national service for over a hundred years. ""He explained this is why RSS volunteers are the first to reach the area whenever a natural disaster strikes anywhere in the country. ""This spirit of 'nation first' always remains paramount in every action and every endeavour of millions of volunteers,"" Modi said and extended his wishes to RSS volunteers.Referring to the coming month, the PM highlighted that Oct 7 marks Maharishi Valmiki Jayanti. ""We all know how great a foundation Maharishi Valmiki laid for Indian culture. It was indeed Maharishi Valmiki who introduced us extensively to the Avatar Kathas of Bhagwan Ram. He presented humanity with the marvellous epic of the Ramayan.""Modi added that the influence of the Ramayan stems from the ideals and values of Bhagwan Ram enshrined in it. ""Bhagwan Ram embraced everyone with a spirit of service, harmony and compassion,"" the PM said.""That is why we feel that the Ram of Maharishi Valmiki's Ramayan is complete only with Mata Shabari and Nishadraj,"" he said, highlighting the significance of the two Ramayan characters, who hailed from marginalised communities.""That is why, friends, when the Ram temple was erected in Ayodhya, a temple dedicated to Nishadraj and Maharishi Valmiki was also built alongside it,"" Modi said and urged those visiting Ayodhya to see Ram Lalla, and the Maharishi Valmiki and Nishadraj temples.","Prime minister narendra modi hails rss for an ""unprecedented and inspiring"" journey.

Addressing a Charmakar Seva Sangh scholarship event where 505 students were felicitated, Gadkari said: ""Crores of people paid their respects during Garg's final journey because he was talented, not because he had other privileges.

""If we give our cultural celebrations global recognition, the world will know them, understand them and come forward to participate. At the same time, I appeal to people to buy local products. This not only boosts traditional industries but directly benefits the families making them, thereby strengthening economy from the grassroots.
