Won’t permit any challenge to 1995 Waqf Act: SC bench

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday said it will on May 20 hear a limited number of advocates for several Muslim petitioners who have challenged the constitutional validity of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, only for the purpose of deciding the necessity and contours of any interim order required to be issued by the court.SG Tushar Mehta said govt has filed a comprehensive affidavit on the three issues flagged by the court in its April 17 order: nomination of non-Muslims to Central Waqf Council and boards, validity of waqf-by-user without valid documents, and the process for identification of govt land under waqf.Perturbed after seeing a number of senior advocates appearing for the Muslim parties and speaking in different voices, a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih said if merely scheduling the hearing takes so much of time and if this there is so much confusion as to who all should be permitted to argue, then the hearing cannot commence.The bench asked lead counsel for the Muslim side, senior advocate Kapil Sibal , to coordinate with other counsels who are arguing against the amendments and file by Saturday a consolidated written submission on the need and shape of interim order. It asked Mehta to articulate his response and submissions by Monday.During the hearing, advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain said the court should allow him to argue a petition challenging the Waqf Act, 1995, as well as the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, both of which are discriminatory based on religion. The bench, however, asked, “How can you challenge the 1995 Act after 30 years?”Jain said the petition also challenges certain provisions of the new waqf law as it has not addressed the unequal situation created in favour of Muslims by the 1995 Act.The bench said, “Do not mix the issues. We will not consider any request for stay of any provision of the Waqf Act, 1995. Just because the Amendment Act, 2025 is challenged, no one can be allowed to jump in to challenge the 1995 legislation.”Sibal said the assurance of the Union govt through the solicitor general on certain aspects should continue till May 20. Mehta said it will continue till May 20.","Supreme court won’t permit any challenge to 1995 waqf act: sc bench.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday slammed MP minister Vijay Shah for his disparaging remarks aimed at Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, who had briefed the media along with foreign secretary Vikram Misri and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh on ‘Operation Sindoor’.When Shah’s counsel Vibha D Makhija sought urgent hearing of his petition questioning high court’s suo motu order directing registration of FIR against the minister, a bench of Chief Justice of India BR Gavai and Justice AG Masih asked whether such a comment behoves the constitutional post held by the petitioner.“When the country is going through a situation, he (Shah) should have been more careful in his speech. Persons holding constitutional office are expected to observe certain standards and exercise restraint in their public speeches,” the bench said.When Makhija sought stay of the HC order directing registration of FIR against Shah, the bench asked, “Why should he not approach the HC under Article 226 of the Constitution? Just because someone is a minister, should we entertain his petition under Article 32?”With persuasion, the bench agreed to list the petition for hearing on Monday but squarely refused to stay the HC order, saying nothing will happen between today and Monday. Makhija said the minister’s remarks were over-hyped by the media and that Shah has apologised publicly for remarks. In a video message on X, Shah had said he was “not only ashamed and saddened by my statement which has hurt the sentiments of every community but I also apologise from the bottom of my heart. Our country’s sister Sofiya Qureshi ji has worked rising above caste and society while fulfilling her national duty”.",Sc raps mp min for remarks aimed at col qureshi.

Despite warning, Dhadda helped Dalla get bail

NEW DELHI: The Lawrence Bishnoi group claimed the killing of a Sikh businessman in Ontario’s Mississauga early Thursday. The victim, Harjit Singh Dhadda , was shot multiple times near his office. Bishnoi’s aide, Rohit Godara , owned up to the killing, accusing Dhadda of furnishing a bail bond for Khalistan Tiger Force chief Arsh Dalla.“I, Rohit Godara, along with Goldy Brother, am taking responsibility. This man was close to our enemies. He got his brother Mehal Singh Uttarakhand murdered by giving money to Arsh Dalla and Sukha Dunuke. All were named in that case,” Godara said in a post.Godara’s post said Dhadda was given a warning a year ago but despite that he helped Arsh Dalla’s release on bail two months ago. “This will be the fate of whoever supports our enemy,” it added.Dhadda, a businessman in the trucking services industry, was shot dead near the intersection of Telford Way and Derry Road in Mississauga, Canada, the local police said. Dhadda was standing near his car when unidentified assailants, believed to have been lying in wait, approached and fired around 20 rounds before fleeing the scene. The gunfire caused panic in the parking lot.A staffer of a local office narrowly avoided injury when a stray bullet entered their office and hit an empty chair, just moments after they stood up. An eyewitness described the scene, saying the gunmen exited a parked car, fired many shots at close range. Dhadda was rushed to the hospital in critical condition but later succumbed to his injuries.Dalla, who replaced slain terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, fled to Canada in July 2020. He was linked to multiple heinous crimes such as murder, extortion, and targeted killings, with more than 13 FIRs registered against him. In January 2023, he was designated a terrorist by the Union home ministry for his involvement in a series of murders, extortion, terror funding, and targeted killings besides terrorist activities.Godara, on the other hand, is on Interpol’s list of wanted men. Interpol issued a red corner notice against Godara in December last year following a request from Indian law enforcement agencies. “On June 13, 2022, Godara is learnt to have fled from Delhi to Dubai on a forged passport issued in the name of one ‘Pawan Kumar’. He is learnt to have taken the same route as his associate, Sachin Bishnoi, who also went to Azerbaijan and was staying in Baku,” said an official.","Lawrence bishnoi group claims the killing of a sikh businessman in ontario.

'Army uniform should not be seen through casteist lens': Yogi Adityanath

NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Ram Gopal Yadav on Thursday sparked a controversy with a remark on the caste of Wing Commander Vyomika Singh of the Indian Air Force.Wing Commander Singh was a regular face in the press briefings on the Indian armed forces' ""Operation Sindoor,"" along with foreign secretary Vikram Misri and Colonel Sofiya Qureshi. Already, there is nationwide anger over the statement by a Madhya Pradesh BJP leader targeting Colonel Qureshi.Yadav made the remark while addressing a programme in Moradabad. He took a dig at the ruling BJP for its pan-India ""Tiranga Yatra"" celebrating the successful military operation.""These people (BJP) are taking out the Tiranga Yatra... They do everything only for elections. What is the need to take out the Tiranga Yatra? If there is a need, then the whole country should be taken into confidence, all the political parties should be taken into confidence. Those who fought there (in Operation Sindoor), are they from the BJP?"" news agency PTI quoted him as saying.Referring to the objectionable comment made by Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah for Colonel Qureshi, the Rajya Sabha MP added, ""One of their ministers abused Colonel Qureshi. The high court has ordered registration of a case against him again. But he did not know who Vyomika Singh was and neither did he know about Air Marshal AK Bharti, otherwise these people would have abused them too.""Yadav further stated, ""Let me tell you. Vyomika Singh is a Jatav from Haryana and Air Marshal Bharti is a Yadav from Purnia. So all three are from PDA (Picchda, dalit, Alpsankhyak or Backwards, dalits and minorities). One was abused as she is a Muslim. The other was spared as the abusers thought she is a Rajput.""Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the SP national general secretary should not see the army through ""casteist lens.""""The uniform of the army is not to be seen through 'casteist lens'. Every soldier performs 'Rashtradharma' and is not a representative of any caste or religion. Binding a brave daughter within the ambit of caste is not only a display of his party's narrow-mindedness but is also a grave insult to the valour of the army and the country's,"" Adityanath posted on X.People would definitely respond to this ""distorted casteist thinking,"" he added.","Ram gopal yadav sparked a controversy with a remark on the caste of wing commander vyomika singh of the indian air force.

LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party national general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav on Thursday stoked a controversy as he invoked the castes of Wing Commander Vyomika Singh and Air Marshal A K Bharti — who were part of the media briefings on Operation Sindoor — to mount an attack on BJP , with the latter shredding him for using “casteist glasses” to look at the armed forces.Talking to the media in Moradabad, Yadav accused BJP of carrying out ‘Tiranga Yatras’ to use Operation Sindoor for political mileage. He said BJP members, who had attacked Col Sofiya Qureshi — who was also part of the briefings along with Wing Commander Vyomika — because of her religion, would have done the same to the two IAF officers, too, if they knew about their castes.“They didn’t even know who Vyomika Singh was or what her caste is, nor did they know about Air Marshal A K Bharti. Otherwise, they would’ve hurled abuses at them, too. Let me tell you, Vyomika Singh is a Jatav from Haryana, and Air Marshal Bharti is a Yadav from Purnia,” he said, grouping the three armed forces officers as “constituents of the Pichhda-Dalit-Alpsankhyak (PDA) bloc”.Referring to Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah’s objectionable comment on Col Sofiya, the SP veteran said: “One was abused because she was a Muslim. One (Wg Cdr Vyomika) was thought to be a Rajput, so nothing was said.”Yadav’s comments evoked a sharp response from Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath , who hit out at the SP neta saying his statement showed his “narrow-mindedness”, and was against the honour of the armed forces. “Every soldier of the Indian Army performs ‘Rashtradharma’ and is not a representative of any caste or religion,” Yogi said in a post on X, admonishing the SP politician for confining a “veerangana (brave) daughter” within the confines of caste.Yogi said it was this “distorted casteist mentality” that divided even patriotism just for the sake of appeasement and vote bank politics.BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia called Yadav’s statement “shameful, reprehensible and criminal.”UP BJP president Bhupendra Chaudhary said Yadav’s remarks were an insult not just to Army and valour of soldiers, but also to crores of Scheduled Caste people. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and his uncle Ram Gopal Yadav could not digest Pakistan’s defeat, and that’s why “they are looking for caste in the Army”, he alleged.Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya said, “Army is beyond caste and religion. Their religion is to protect the country. Seeing Army through the lens of caste is a sick mentality.”",Samajwadi party national general secretary ram gopal yadav invoked castes of wing commander vyomika singh and air marshal a k bharti.

A river again runs through UP’s parched Jalaun,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-river-again-runs-through-ups-parched-jalaun/articleshow/121196212.cms,"File photo

LUCKNOW: Farmers of Jalaun in UP’s parched Bundelkhand will not have to toil too much this season to get water for crops. They have almost revived an 81km-long local river that had dried up completely, four years after PM Modi extolled the mission in his Mann Ki Baat radio programme as a brilliant example of “people’s will doing wonders”.Community members have restored the drainage basin over a 14km course of Noon river to create a funnel through which water has again entered it. The river had dried up to encroachments and poor rainfall.The revival commenced in 2021 and reached the final stage only recently, with voluntary labour contributions from thousands of local men and women. Officials said the water would start flowing through the entire course of the river in a fortnight. The river is expected to help more than 15,350 farmers.PM Modi had pointed out that the formation of a committee of thousands of villagers from various panchayats in Jalaun set the ball rolling for the river’s revival.Noon meandered across 47 villages before merging with Yamuna on the other side of Jalaun. The river was earlier a key source of irrigation for agricultural fields spread over 2,780 hectares, as well as for animals looking for a waterbody in the dry region. But dwindling rainfall and sporadic construction activities changed the river’s contours, preventing water collected during the monsoon from funnelling down into the riverbed.Jalaun DM Rajesh Kumar Pandey noted that local politicians, social workers, and professionals played a crucial role in the river’s revival. “Having realised the consequences of unplanned activity, they all were equally committed to removing the hurdles and roadblocks that stalled the progress,” said Pandey.","Community members have restored the drainage basin over a 14km course of noon river to create a funnel through which water has again entered it.

NEW DELHI: Reading the riot act to Telangana govt, Supreme Court on Thursday said it would hold the state chief secretary and other officials accountable and send them to jail if the part of Kancha Gachibowli forest adjacent to Hyderabad Central University that was levelled for an information technology centre is not restored with afforestation in two months.A bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih asked senior advocate A M Singhvi, who appeared for Telangana govt and attempted to persuade the court about the necessity of setting up the IT centre with protection of forests, whether any forest clearance was taken before trees were felled in a “tearing hurry on a long weekend knowing fully well that the SC’s forest bench would not be available for hearing the matter”.“Did you (Telangana govt) have environment clearance ? If you want to save yourself from contempt, take restoration measures. Otherwise, your chief secretary must get ready to go to jail,” the CJI-led bench cautioned. The bench was not moved when Singhvi said huge afforestation and plantation activities are being undertaken by the state. “Not in the area where the deforestation was carried out,” said Justice Masih . The CJI posted the matter, which the court had taken cognizance of suo motu, for further hearing on July 23.The CJI said, “If you try to defend your action, the chief secretary and dozen other officials responsible for deforestation will stand in danger of contempt.”“You took advantage of a long weekend and brought in a dozen bulldozers to cut down the trees and level the forest area. Prima facie it appears pre-planned. You did so knowing fully well that the bench was not available on the long weekend. Why didn’t you start work on a Monday,” the bench asked.Singhvi said he would like to persuade the court about IT and forest going together. CJI Gavai said, “We are for sustainable development but in this case the state must restore the land to its original shape during the monsoon period.”It was amicus curiae in forest matters, senior advocate K Parameshwar, who brought the illegal felling of trees in the forest patch, leading SC to send an HC registrar for an on-the-spot inquiry. In his report, the registrar informed court around 100 acres of forest land has been destroyed even though wildlife was seen in the area.SC had taken umbrage at Telangana govt’s audacity in carrying out deforestation when the state on March 15 had constituted the forest committee, as directed by SC on Feb 3, for identification of forest areas which have not been so notified.

This direction could create ripples across states and for allottees who have manipulated rules to get forest lands.SC said, “This is a classic example as to how the nexus between the politicians, bureaucrats and builders can result in the conversion of precious forest land for commercial purposes under the garb of resettlement of people belonging to the backward class from whose ancestors, agricultural land was acquired for public purpose.”Writing the judgment, CJI Gavai said, “We hold that the allotment of 11.89 ha (30 acres) of reserve forest land in Survey No.21, Kondhwa Budruk in district Pune for agriculture purposes on Aug 28, 1998, and subsequent permission given for its sale in favour of RRCHS on Oct 30, 1999, was totally illegal.” It also quashed the Union forest ministry’s July 2007 clearance to the project terming it illegal.“We direct that the possession of the subject land, which is reserved as a forest land, but is in possession of the revenue department, should be handed over to the forest department within a period of three months,” the bench said.While adjudicating this case, SC noticed that vast stretches of notified forest land continue to be in possession of revenue departments.","Sc cancels maharashtra govt’s illegal allotment of 30 acres of reserved forest land in pune.

First monthly PLFS Bulletin

NEW DELHI: The unemployment rate for those in the 15 years and above age group in the country was estimated at 5.1% in Apr while in rural areas it was at 4.5% and urban centres at 6.5%, the first monthly bulletin of the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) showed on Thursday.PLFS has been revamped since Jan this year and the latest addition to the jobs data in the form of a monthly bulletin has been done to ensure availability of high frequency labour market data with enhanced coverage to aid timely policy intervention. It contains data for both urban and rural areas.Among males in the 15 years and above age group the joblessness rate was 5.2% while it was 5% for females in this category.The unemployment rate among rural male of age 15 years and above was 4.9% during Apr while it was 3.9% for females. In urban areas the joblessness rate among females in the 15 years and above age group during Apr was 8.7% compared to 5.8% for males in the same age group.The estimates of unemployment under the current weekly status (CWS) provides an average picture of joblessness in a short period of seven days during the survey period.

BIJAPUR: A four-legged CRPF soldier, adept at taking the sting out of Maoist attack plans with its infantry patrolling, explosive detection and assault skills and manoeuvres, fell to a sting-assault by 200 honeybees to attain martyrhood in the biggest-ever anti-Naxal operation .K9 Rolo, a handsome Belgian Malinois who got past its second birthday only last month, was part of the 21-day operation by the CRPF and Chhattisgarh police at Karreguttalu Hills on Chhattisgarh-Telangana border. Trained at the CRPF dog breeding and training school (DBTS), Bengaluru, it was drafted into anti-Naxal duties in CRPF 228th battalion in April 2024.During the special operation at KGH, while Rolo and other CRPF troops were in the midst of an intensive search operation, a swarm of bees waylaid the dog, embedding scores of stings into his otherwise combat-trained body.Handlers of the K9 soldier moved fast, shielding it with a polythene sheet to cut off the bee attack . Unfortunately, this did not help as the bees managed to sneak inside the cover to resume their stinging assault with added force.Rolo, by then overwhelmed with pain and irritation, went berserk and shook the cover off, making itself vulnerable to even more bites. By the end of the ordeal, it had around 200 bee stings inside him, which rendered it unconscious. An immediate medical evacuation was performed by its human co-soldiers. Emergency treatment was administered by the handlers. However, Rolo succumbed to the pain and suffering while still being evacuated.K9 was declared ‘brought dead’ by the veterinary doctor. The canine martyr laid its life being a loyal soldier and assisting CRPF in busting hideouts and sniffing out explosives dumps dotting KG Hills. K9 Rolo’s sacrifice received a fitting tribute; it was laid to rest with a guard of honour and shall now be posthumously awarded a commendation disk by CRPF director general.",Belgian malinois dies of bee attack in biggest-ever anti-naxal operation.

The President's 14 questions

Prez:

Deemed assent concept

alien to constitutional scheme

NEW DELHI: In a sharp response to the April 8 verdict of Supreme Court, fixing deadlines for the governor and the President to decide on state Bills in the Tamil Nadu govt versus governor case, President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday asked the apex court how it could have given such a ruling when the Constitution had no such stipulations.Aware that a petition seeking review of the 415-page judgment by Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan would not yield positive outcome as it is ought be considered by the same bench in chamber, the Union govt invoked the President’s rarely used powers under Article 143(1) of the Constitution to seek SC’s opinion on a myriad contentious issues thrown up by the judgment, which it considers to be a clear overreach. Specifically, the President sought SC’s view on 14 questions.The President said Articles 200 and 201, applicable to governors and President respectively, “does not stipulate any time frame or procedure” to be followed by them while considering grant or refusal of assent to a bill passed by an assembly.“The exercise of constitutional discretion by governor and the President under Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution, respectively, are essentially governed by polycentric considerations, including federalism, uniformity of laws, integrity and security of the nation, doctrine of separation of powers,” she said, adding that she resorted to Article 143(1) in seeking the SC’s opinion as the apex court has in the past delivered conflicting judgments on the justiciability of presidential assent to bills .Article 200 mandates the governor, on presentation of a bill passed by an assembly, to grant assent or “as soon as possible” return the bill, excluding Money bills, for reconsideration by the House. The provision also lays down that the governor “shall not withhold assent” when the bill, after having been reconsidered, is sent to him .However, when a governor reserves a bill for consideration of the President, she under Article 201 is mandated to declare whether she assents to the bill or withholds it. The Constitution, however, does not prescribe a timeframe for the President to take a particular action once the bill , after having been reconsidered by the assembly, is presented to her again for assent.Without any express provision in the Constitution, the bench of Justices Pardiwala and Mahadevan had set a three-month deadline for the governor to either grant or return the bill to the House.If the bill is re-passed by the House and resent to him, then the governor must grant assent within a month, SC had ruled. It had also fixed a three-month deadline for the President to decide whether to grant or refuse assent to a bill.Critical of the SC using its Article 142 powers to rule that the 10 bills pending with the Tamil Nadu governor would be deemed to have been assented to, the President said, “The concept of a deemed assent of the President and the governor is alien to the constitutional scheme and fundamentally circumscribes the powers of the President and the governor”.The President also questioned the logic behind SC ruling that suggested that it would be better if the President seeks the opinion of the apex court in advance on whether to give assent to bills reserved for her by the governors.She said SC needs to give its opinion also contours and scope of provisions contained in Article 142 (which gives omnibus power to SC to do complete justice) “in the context of issues (assent to bills) which are occupied by either constitutional provisions or statutory provisions.In addition, she questioned the states increasingly using writ jurisdiction of the SC under Article 32 (which is meant for remedying violations of fundamental rights of citizens) instead of Article 131 (Centre-state dispute to be adjudicated only by the SC) to adjudicate issues “which by their nature are federal issues involving interpretation of the Constitution.”",President droupadi murmu on wednesday asked the apex court how it could have given such a ruling when the constitution had no such stipulations.
