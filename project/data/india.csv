Aravali case: We will allow lawful mining only, says SC

NEW DELHI : SC asked the environment ministry and other stakeholders on Thursday to suggest names of domain experts for the committee to be tasked with defining the Aravali hills and ranges, and observed that only lawful mining would be allowed in the region.The top court, on Dec 29, had taken note of the outcry over the new definition of Aravalis and kept in abeyance its Nov 20 order accepting a uniform definition of the hills and ranges. It had also put all mining on hold.On Thursday, a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi extended its earlier stay order on mining for the time being.During the hearing, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for a litigant, said the company had a mining license and had won the right to mine after a protracted battle. Now, because of the court order, mining had been stalled.“We will allow lawful mining only... let the experts tell us (the definition). We will cross all bridges and reach the right destination,” the CJI said.The bench asked lawyer Jay Cheema to assist it. Senior advocate K Parmeswar is already assisting the bench as amicus curiae.“We request the (environment) ministry to suggest a panel of domain experts along with their profiles.Senior counsel are also requested to give profiles of some eminent domain experts for the purpose of constituting the committee, as was observed by this court,” the bench said.The bench said it was conscious of the fact that all activities, especially mining by licenced firms, have come to a halt. “However, status quo will have to be maintained for the time being till some preliminary issues are answered in a phased manner. Post this matter for the constitution of the committee,” the CJI said.The bench asked stakeholders to submit written notes by March 10 after the amicus curiae submitted his suggestions on the aspect of definitions of the Aravali hills and ranges.The bench said it will set up the panel of experts and frame issues to be decided on the next date of hearing.Earlier, the bench said it seemed prima facie that the earlier report of a committee and the verdict had “omitted to expressly clarify certain critical issues” and there was a “dire need to further probe” to prevent any regulatory gaps that might undermine the ecological integrity of the Aravali region.“There has been a significant outcry among environmentalists, who have expressed concern about the potential for misinterpretation and improper implementation of the... definition and this court's directions,” the bench had said.","The top court, on dec 29, had taken note of the outcry over the new definition of aravalis.

’ imprint far exceeds physical dimensions

Living Mountains

Mountains that define art, culture

What are the Aravallis? An answer to this seemingly straightforward question was stayed by Supreme Court last Dec after it sparked a public outcry for being too narrow in scope. The top court now wants a new yardstick to define the range, which stretches 600km across four states and, at close to 2 billion years old, represents India’s oldest fold mountains. But talk to people on the ground in Rajasthan, the state synonymous with the Aravallis, and it becomes evident that the measure of these mountains lies not so much in their height, but in how deeply they have shaped the lives of the people who call the landscape home.The now-shelved definition — involving a 100m elevation cutoff and proximity of 500m between hills for demarcating the range — had inspired fears that a significant portion of the Aravallis would be stripped of environmental protections. For people who live in its folds, the stakes are immediate: if the map shrinks, so do forests, grazing commons, water systems, sacred groves, and the checks that stand between community life and mining, fragmentation and forced migration.“The Aravallis and our communities share a bond that goes back centuries. These mountains are not just geography for us. They are a living god, central to our identity and survival,” says Hari Ram Meena, tribal writer and former IPS officer.The Aravallis are home to some of Rajasthan’s oldest communities. The Meena tribe once ruled large parts of the Jaipur region, controlling strategic passes of the Aravallis before the rise of the Kachwaha Rajputs. In southern Rajasthan, Bhil chieftains held sway over vast forested tracts. “The Bhils were known as the ‘kings of the forest’. So crucial was their role that the royal coat of arms of Mewar depicts a Rajput warrior on one side and a Bhil warrior on the other,” Meena adds.The mountains also shaped warfare. During Maharana Pratap’s resistance against the Mughals, the Aravallis enabled guerrilla tactics and hidden movement based on local knowledge of forests, mountain passes and water sources.If the hills protect, they also sustain. The Aravallis are Rajasthan’s ecological spine. It regulates climate, arrests desertification, feeds rivers like the Banas, Luni and Sabarmati, and helps forests survive in a largely arid landscape. It is also a cultural watershed, separating not just river systems flowing towards the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, but also shaping traditions, languages and ways of life.For communities such as the Bhil, Meena, Garasia, Saharia, Raika, Rewari, Mogia, Nath, and Gurjar, the mountains are not a resource, but a living presence. Temples, sacred groves, hilltop shrines, and forest deities dot the landscape and the mountains are treated as a ‘prakriti tirtha’, a sacred geography.Life in the Aravallis has always revolved around forest produce, livestock and water. Communities collect food, fuelwood, medicinal herbs, bamboo, tendu leaves and wild fruits from the forest. Rain-fed terraced farming supports hardy crops such as millets and pulses, while hill slopes provide grazing areas for cattle, sheep, goats and camels.Traditional water systems are central to survival. ‘ Johads ’, stepwells, nadis and baoris — built and maintained collectively — harvest rainwater and recharge groundwater. “Our water structures are our lifeline. They are protected not by law but by community ethics,” Meena says.Social activist Kunj Bihari Sharma explains how deeply human and animal life are intertwined here. “Aravalli forests are not just greenery,” he says. “They are sources of fuel, fodder, herbs and water. In summers, even wild animals depend on village wells and grazing areas. Humans and wildlife survive together.”But this balance has been steadily eroded. Over the years, communities were told that forests belonged to the state, not to them. “Earlier, people built johads through collective labour. Now, even that is restricted. At the same time, illegal mining and stone mafia hollow out the hills,” Sharma says.Nowhere is the impact more visible than among Denotified Tribes (DNTs) and nomadic communities, whose lives depend entirely on grazing landscapes. Gopal Keshawat, former chairperson of the Development and Welfare Board for Denotified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Communities, warns that mining has triggered a deep livelihood crisis. “Pastoral communities survive on livestock, milk, wool and leather. When grazing lands are destroyed, their entire economy collapses,” he says.Keshawat says that nearly 10% of India’s nomadic population and more than one crore people in Rajasthan depend on Aravalli-linked ecosystems. He recalls that commissions such as the Ayyangar Committee, and Balkrishna Renke Commission had clearly recommended mining bans in the Aravallis and separate grazing lands for DNT communities. “These recommendations were to protect both people and nature. Ignoring them puts animals and humans at equal risk,” he said. But, where laws fail, cultural practices continue to protect biodiversity.Across Rajasthan, ‘orans’, or community-protected sacred groves, remain untouched due to religious beliefs. Social sanction rather than written rules prohibit tree-cutting and hunting in these forests, dedicated to local deities like Bhadarva Dev and Pandurimata.Among the most powerful expressions of this belief is the Gawari dance of the Bhil community. Dedicated to Shiva and Parvati and performed over 45 days by men in parts of Udaipur district, the dance is both spiritual and ecological — what social activist Kishan Gurjar says “is not entertainment, but the worship of nature”. “Cutting forests is considered a sin, and Gawari spreads the message of conservation,” Gurjar adds.The Aravallis are also deeply linked to nomadic communities such as the Sapera or Kalbelia. “The Kalbelia learned to live with snakes, treat snake bites and understand forest behaviour,” says social justice researcher Navin Narayan, who has worked with these groups for over 20 years. Kalbelia were once seen as protectors of villages, not entertainers. Amid mining and forest loss, Narayan warns that the shrinking Aravallis are threatening not only their livelihoods, but also the traditional knowledge that connected people with nature for generations.“The survival of the Aravallis is largely because of indigenous communities. These hills have protected people, and people have protected the hills,” says Manish Barod, block president of the Scheduled Areas Reservation Front in Udaipur. It’s a link that is repeatedly stressed with an eye on the Aravallis’ future, with activists and stakeholders saying that protecting the mountains is much more than a simple definition. “Reducing Aravallis to physical measurements denies its reality. It is a socioecological organism where folk culture, agriculture and community knowledge are deeply intertwined,” says sociologist Shyam Sunder Jyani.What is at stake is not just forests or hills, but Rajasthan’s living memory — its languages, rituals, arts and ways of life shaped over millennia.Along the banks of the Banas river, which originates in the Aravallis, lies Molela village that’s famed for its terracotta sculptures of deities. Ask potter Prabhu Gameti, and he says the craft exists because of the mountains. “The clay from the Banas is smooth and flexible. When fired, it doesn’t crack. That’s why idols made here last generations,” he explains.Researcher and folk artist Madan Meena warns that environmental destruction directly erases culture. “When livelihoods collapse, people migrate. And when people migrate, languages die,” he says, referring to the more than two dozen languages and dialects, many existing only in oral tradition, that are spoken in the region. An art form carries hundreds of words linked to seasons, tools, etc. “When an art form disappears, an entire vocabulary disappears with it,” he says.Communities like the Mogiya, who collect medicinal herbs, and the Nath sect, whose shrines such as Pandupol lie deep within the hills, show how belief, livelihood and landscape merge seamlessly. Also, Jain temples, Buddhist remnants and folk shrines together reflect the Aravallis’ religious diversity. “The Aravallis prevented cultural homogenisation in Mewar. Its geography ensures this region’s diversity,” says C S Sharma, a history professor in Udaipur.","The aravallis are rajasthan’s ecological spine. It regulates climate, arrests desertification, feeds rivers like the banas, luni and sabarmati, and helps forests survive in a largely arid landscape.

Un-fare deal: Namma Metro fare hike sparks backlash as Bengaluru commuters shift back to private vehicles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/un-fare-deal-bengalureans-restart-own-vehicles/articleshow/128793617.cms,"Bengaluru: Ex-BBMP Engineer’s Suicide After Corruption Probe, Infant Injury at Hospital

Namma Metro Fare hike that was proposed

Reactions with mugshots:





BENGALURU: The huge gains of Metro as a friendly and efficient public transport are being undone by frequent fare hikes and last-mile connectivity woes. The perception that commuting by Metro in Bengaluru is becoming increasingly expensive is gaining ground: More commuters are returning to their personal vehicles, worsening traffic congestion across the city.While there is no data-based quantification yet (such as new vehicle sales in the recent past), both motorists and traffic police say they are witnessing a perceptible slowdown in traffic flow. Officers note a visible surge in the number of two-wheelers on city roads, especially during peak hours. Once seen as faster, safer and relatively affordable, Namma Metro is no longer the obvious first choice for many commuters.According to transport department data, Bengaluru city has over 80 lakh registered two-wheelers as of 2026. Traffic police fear that a renewed reliance on private vehicles will translate into longer travel times and mounting congestion in the coming months.Unni Krishna Menon, who earlier commuted by Metro between Jalahalli and Indiranagar, has now switched back to his car. ""While the Metro is convenient, the proposed fare hikes and last-mile connectivity gaps would make it less viable for me.Travelling from Jalahalli to Indiranagar costs around Rs 70 one way, and I pay Rs 30 for the first four hours of parking. On reaching Indiranagar, I still need an autorickshaw or a cab to reach my office in Domlur. Each day cost me Rs 220, but if I fill my car with Rs 500 petrol, I can go for 2.5 days, which is cheaper,"" Menon explained the commute math to TOI.Echoing this sentiment, college student Jatin Polanki said he has shifted to his bike, well almost. ""I used to take the Metro regularly in my first year, travelling from Pattanagere to Majestic for about Rs 30 one way. After the initial hike in fares and early classes, I started using a bike. In Rs 100, I can go to college, roam around, and come back.""Resident welfare groups warn that higher user charges for essential services could prove counterproductive. Christopher Cruz of NERWA said, ""Public transport is any city's lifeline and critical to decongesting the city. Revenue cannot be a consideration. Making the Metro expensive in a city like Bengaluru, already infamous for traffic, is counterproductive.""Some commuters argue that cost alone is not the deciding factor. Techie Naresh Sadasivan said, ""Public transport will win 10 out of 10 times if it offers good connectivity and user experience. What pushes people to private transport is unpredictability and poor interconnectivity. Fix that, and people will pay a fair price.""0–2 km: Rs 11 (previously Rs 10)2–4 km: Rs 21 (previously Rs 20)4–6 km: Rs 32 (previously Rs 30)6–8 km: Rs 42 (previously Rs 40)8–10 km: Rs 53 (previously Rs 50)10–15 km: Rs 63 (previously Rs 60)15–20 km: Rs 74 (previously Rs 70)20–25 km: Rs 84 (previously Rs 80)25–30 km / Above 30 km: Rs 95 (previously Rs 90)Ramdev Satyanarayana, RWA, Konankunte""The Metro fare hike is concerning for the commuter. Though I have access to both a car and a two-wheeler, I consciously chose Metro because it is safer, faster, and far more convenient. However, fare hikes leave commuters like me with little choice but to reconsider our travel options. Such increases risk discouraging daily commuters who depend on affordable public transport. Keeping the Metro accessible is crucial not just for commuters, but also for reducing traffic congestion and promoting sustainable urban mobility. ""Shivkumar V, general secretary, Domlur Layout Resident Welfare Association""The repeated fare increases place a direct burden on the common man, another steep revision is unfair. This will inevitably push people back to private vehicles or already overcrowded public buses, worsening road congestion.""Shany Sunny, Joint Secretary, Indiranagar Stage 1 RWA""I know of friends and family members who shifted back to bikes. The primary reason is the increase in fares — for many, travelling by bike is cost-effective. An overcrowded Metro no longer feels like a comfortable escape from the daily commute rush. While it may help avoid vehicular pollution, the experience itself is stressful due to the heavy crowd.""","More commuters are returning to their personal vehicles, worsening traffic congestion.

'UPI Will Be Used In Israel': PM Modi After Key Meet With Netanyahu, Pushes India-Israel FTA

Congress attack reflects Rahul’s frustration: BJP

NEW DELHI: Congress Thursday said PM Modi’s address to the Knesset was an “unabashed defence of his host” Benjamin Netanyahu, adding it has diminished India’s moral standing. The party released a letter by Jawaharlal Nehru to Albert Einstein, in which the first PM termed the rights of Arabs as crucial in the context of creation of Israel.Referring to Modi’s statement that India had recognised Israel on the day of his birth, Congress spokesman Jairam Ramesh said Einstein wrote to Nehru on June 13, 1947, on the subject of creation of Israel, and the latter replied on July 11. He posted Nehru’s letter on X.Nehru wrote, “I confess that while I have a very great deal of sympathy for the Jews, I feel sympathy for the Arabs also in their predicament.”BJP Thursday hit back at Congress over its criticism of PM Modi’s Israel address, saying the attack reflected frustration over Rahul Gandhi’s fading prime ministerial prospects. BJP spokesman Sambit Patra highlighted Modi’s standing ovation at the Knesset and the Speaker’s Medal honour, while alleging Congress was attempting to tarnish India’s image through stirs, campaigns.","Congress said pm modi’s address to the knesset was an “unabashed defence of his host’ benjamin netanyahu.

Once she came to Wayanad, she couldn't continue not talking to me.""The plan, he admitted, didn't work immediately. Priyanka remained unimpressed on the flight. ""But the moment we reached Wayanad, she started talking to me again.That is the magic of Wayanad,"" Rahul added.Rahul Gandhi, who previously represented Wayanad in Lok Sabha, vacated the seat after winning from both the Kerala constituency and Rae Bareily in Uttar Pradesh in the 2024 elections.The constituency is now represented by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.","Rahul gandhi was speaking at the foundation stone-laying ceremony for houses being built by the party for victims of the 2024 wayanad landslide.

SC: Ensure all copies, hard or soft, are seized, removed from public access

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday banned the Class 8 social science textbook that had a section on corruption in judiciary, prohibited its circulation in all forms and asked the school education secretary and NCERT chairperson to show cause why contempt proceedings not be initiated against them despite the Centre tendering an unconditional and unqualified apology for the fiasco.The second day of hearing in the case saw solicitor general Tushar Mehta, right at the outset, apoologising for ""the unpardonable mistake"" committed by two persons who authored the book and said the govt has taken a decision to permanently bar them from involvement in preparation of any textbook.SC, however, said that it would not accept the apology at this stage and would inquire whether there was a deliberate and calculated design to denigrate the institution and harm its reputation.A shot has been fired mindlessly and the judiciary is bleeding. The design was to defame the judiciary by telling students, their parents and teachers, the entire society, about corruption. As the head of the institution, it is my duty to protect the institution from such macabre and baseless insinuations,"" CJI Kant said.The bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant, Justice Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi ordered, ""The NCERT in coordination with the Union and state education depts is directed to ensure that all copies of the book (hard or soft) currently in circulation, whether held in storage, retail outlets, or educational institutions, are seized and removed from public access.Compliance be filed."" Further, it said, ""It shall be personal responsibility of NCERT director and the principal of every school where the book has reached to effectuate immediate seizure and sealing of all copies of the book in their premises and submit a compliance report. Ensure that no instruction is imparted based on the subject book. Principal secretaries of all states are to comply.""It asked the NCERT to file compliance within two weeks.""As an abundant precaution, a complete blanket ban is hereby imposed on any further publication, reprinting or digital dissemination of the book. Any attempt to circumvent this order through electronic means or altered titles shall be seen as direct interference, wilful breach and defiance of directions,"" it said.The CJI-headed bench directed NCERT to reveal the name of persons who were entrusted with preparing the textbook, their credentials and submit the minutes of the meetings where the contents of the book were deliberated upon and finalised. The court posted the matter for further hearing on March 11.The bench said the manner in which corruption in judiciary is portrayed in the book by imputing several complaints against judges, a deliberate impression was given that the judiciary has not acted upon those complaints. The solicitor general said the way pendency figures are quoted to mention in the book that 'justice delayed is justice denied' appears to teach the children that justice is denied in India. Nothing could be farther from truth, he said.Senior advocates Kapil Sibal, A M Singhvi and Vikas Singh termed the portion in the textbook scandalous, calculated and designed to selectively target judiciary to denigrate its image. CJI Kant said politicians, bureaucrats and other professionals are being regularly convicted for various offences and yet judiciary has been blatantly targeted. He said, ""The authors forgot that judiciary has played a stellar role in protecting the Constitution, the fundamental rights of citizens and passed series of orders over the last 75 years to protect democracy, not to mention its stellar role in making it possible to provide free legal aid to poor and marginalised sections of the society.

The film will not be released on February 27.Against this backdrop, the question arises: Is something actually wrong with the Kerala Story?“Everything,” said Anitha, a journalist from Kerala, before launching into a spirited explanation.“Not all girls wear jasmine flower,” she added, recalling her experience of watchingSince the movie is yet to be released, one could give the makers the benefit of doubt.However, the trailer and teaser have already made several Malayalis question the authenticity of certain scenes and the broader narrative.From claims about forced beef feeding, to the debate around “love jihad,” to questions about data and representation — the controversy surrounding the film continues to expand beyond cinema and into politics, law, and public perception.What follows is a closer look at the concerns, the counter-arguments, and the debate surroundingOne of the first things that was flagged the most, was the forcibly feeding beef scene. The parotta was missing, joked several Malayalis on social media.In the trailer, a woman is seen being held back by a few people until one person forcibly shoves beef into her mouth as she screams –The director of the movie Kamakhya Singh said that he wanted to highlight the “religious conversions” that are taking place by forcibly feeding people beef.“Yeah, once you taste beef, you don’t want to go back to a life where beef is prohibited. It’s that tasty especially, with a hot fluffy porotta,” remarked Saneed Khader, 26-year-old Keralite who runs an event management company while pursuing his masters in journalism.Another Malayali who has spent most of her life in Kerala, but now works for an advertising firm in Bengaluru said: “I lived my whole life in Kerala, 25 years at least, I have met thousands and thousands of people.”But I have never met one Malayali who went eeeeewwhhh on beef. It was always 'let's go have beef parotta',"" she said.“Almost everyone in Kerala eats beef, be it Christian, Muslim or Hindu,” said Sooraj Sudhir, a 24-year-old Kerala resident who works as a sub editor for a Malayalam news outlet in Kottayam, a Christian-majority city in central state.“Historically, the number of strict vegetarians in Kerala was very limited. With the spread of modern culture, beef has become widely consumed across the state. While in earlier times it was prepared mainly by non-Hindus, today it has become a common part of Kerala’s kitchens,” said Sivadasan Mankada, history professor at Calicut University.Hindu form 54.73% of Kerala’s population, almost double of Muslims. The state’s beef consumption is about three times that of Tamil Nadu and more than seven times that of Christian-majority Meghalaya, according to official data The historical accounts offer varied accounts of how this particular dish became a central part of Kerala cuisine.“Meat also played a central role in rituals and festivals among the general public, including Hindus,” Mankada said.“Kerala’s food culture has been predominantly non-vegetarian since ancient times. Fish and meat have always been integral to the cuisine, and eating meat was never a matter of social conflict. Communities from the Nairs downward traditionally consumed a wide variety of meats. Hunting and catching animals for food formed an important part of Kerala’s culinary history,” he added.Another point of contention that the trailer has, is the 'love jihad' and the conversion issue.“When you are sick, you must accept first that you are sick,” remarked Vipul Amrutlal Shah when asked if the movie was meant to spread hate against Kerala.“The Malayalis are ok here. We are okay here. The way they have portrayed this (love jihad) is very wrong. We are over this,” said Arunthathi.The makers of the movie held a press conference where they brought victims of “religious conversion”, none of whom were from Kerala.When asked by the reporters, he said that it was a “pan-India movie”. Quickly clarifying after, director Kamakhya Singh said: “It’s related to Kerala also and from Kerala, how it’s all over India.”The question arises, why is it named ‘Kerala’ Story. Is it more about creating a certain image of the state among north Indians instead of polarising Kerala itself?Film critic, journalist and academician from Kerala A Chandrashekar agrees.Chandrashekar further pointed out that the National Award–winning, which initially claimed there were 32,000 alleged forced religious conversions in the state before later describing itself as a fictional film, was therefore misleading. “We have only 3 cases recorded in India about the conversion of girls from Kerala who were taken to Syria and later got recruited by the IS,” he said.“Any kind of such narratives like forceful feeding of beef etc doesn't happen in Kerala and having a narrative like that even fictitiously cannot be tolerated as they are factually incorrect or fake. Hence the movie falls under the category of Disinformation or Mal information,” he added.The controversy around The Kerala Story began with its central storyline, which portrays three women from Kerala as victims of so-called 'love jihad' and recruitment into extremist groups.The controversy was about the film's teaser that claimed that 32,000 women from Kerala had been radicalised and sent to Syria and Yemen. When questioned about the unverified and exaggerated, arguing that it misrepresented the state and could promote communal tensions. Following the backlash, the filmmakers clarified that the number was based on media reports, and later removed the specific figure from promotional material.Questions about the accuracy of the film’s claims were further highlighted by official data. Information obtained through an RTI from the ministry of home affairs showed that between 2014 and 2020, the National Investigation Agency arrested 177 individuals across India in ISIS-related cases, of whom 19 were from Kerala—figures that critics say contrast sharply with the numbers suggested in the film, a News Minute report said.The movie went on to receive a National Award.“The only Malayalam filmmaker who was in the National Film Awards Committee last year tried his level best to convince the Jury headed by Ashuthosh Gowarikkar that the plot narrated in Kerala Story 1 is absolutely baseless and based on a stray incident. He argued that if that film (which is cinematically a big zero in its visualisation and editing) is selected for the best film and director, it would be insulting and hurt the State's sentiments, but even the chairman was unwilling to accept,” Chandrashekhar said.The movie’s teaser opens with three women, initially Hindu at least by their names, eventually clad in hijabs with bruises on their faces, speaking of their horrific experiences of falling in love with Muslim guys.The messaging is clear– love jihad is a thing.""There was a phase in all our lives, around ten years back, when we had this conversation for a month,"" she said on love jihaad. She noted that the conversations sparked from TVs and social media where they said ""love jihaad was happening. After then we never had that conversation.” ""No body is concerned about these things any more,"" Arunthathi said.She further recalled a specific incident that was used as an example to caution her by her parents. ""One of our neighbours fell in love with a Muslim guy. She eloped with him. When they reached the guy's home, suddenly he wanted her to change her religion threatening her of divorce. Her name was changed from Archana to Aashna,” she said, trying hard to recall the woman's first name, adding how the woman was later forced by her in-laws to send her two sons to ‘Islamic schools’.The Calicut University history professor termed ‘love jihad’ “an artificially constructed narrative designed to malign and undermine Kerala’s composite culture.”“The concept of ‘love jihad’ is an artificially constructed narrative designed to malign and undermine Kerala’s composite culture. In reality, the number of young people choosing partners across religious boundaries has been steadily increasing throughout India. Kerala has often taken the lead in supporting such interfaith marriages. Couples are free to live anywhere in the state, and progressive-minded communities continue to extend their support to them,” he said.Saneed Khader questioned the legitimacy of the term. “Has any legitimate authority ever given a valid statement on love jihad happening in Kerala based on statistics and data? I don’t think so.. as far as I know, love jihad is a term found by right wing hindutva to terrorise Muslim community .. may be some cases of forced conversions have happened in Kerala in the cases of love marriages. But the thing is, similar incidents have been happening all over India and Muslims are not the only ones who are behind these forcible conversions. ”Another term widely being associated with the movie is propaganda.Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap too dismissed it as a propaganda movie.“It is not like propaganda movies like The Accidental Prime Minister or even Emergency, which were based on books written by persons who knew the persons in the narratives closely,” said film critic Chandrashekhar, adding, that “it does not have any concrete evidence or documents to support the claims put forth by the movies.”Propaganda is information, ideas, or messaging that is spread in a way designed to influence people’s opinions or beliefs, often by presenting only one side of an issue.It can use emotional language, selective facts, or exaggeration to shape public perception. Propaganda is commonly used in politics, advertising, and media, and it may sometimes leave out balanced or opposing viewpoints.He went on to highlight that many movies from Malayalam like Puzhu, Bharath Circus etc released over the recent past “have come up with fake and false narratives from within the state blaming the hindus for Dalit oppression placing the Hindutwa movements on the defensive.”“We should recognise that whatever opinions that are applicable to Kerala Story are applicable to them also,” he said.Speaking of intelligent propaganda, he said that movies like “Akshay Kumar's Gold, and Yami Gautham's HAQ” could be “politically read as intelligent propaganda movies against Pakistan/Islam”.","Kerala story 2 sparks fresh controversy after court notice over certification & content concerns.

NEW DELHI: The Kerala High Court on Thursday issued an interim stay on the release of the film ‘The Kerala Story 2: Goes Beyond’, for 15 days, a day before its scheduled to release on February 27.The Court observed that, prima facie, there appeared to be non-application of mind by the censor board while granting certification to the movie, reported PTI.The interim order came after the court heard petitions challenging the censor certificate granted to the film and seeking suspension of its release. The bench of Justice Bechu Kurian Thomas was considering pleas filed by Sreedev Namboothiri of Kannur and others.During proceedings on Tuesday, the court orally observed that the apprehensions raised by sections of people in Kerala over the film’s release could not be ignored, particularly since the filmmakers had claimed it was based on true events and had used ‘Kerala’ in the title.“Kerala lives in total harmony among various religions. But portraying it in such a manner as though this is what is happening all over Kerala gives a wrong indication and may also incite passions, which is where the censor board comes into play,” the court said.Later in the day makers of the film filed for a review of the judgement in front of a division bench.According to Bar to Bench, the matter was taken up for an urgent hearing at 7:30 pm, late evening. During the hearing the Justices observed that given the public interest nature of the matter it should not have been heard by a single bench.The division bench after hearing both parties reserved the order.","The kerala high court issued an interim stay on the release of the film ‘the kerala story 2: goes beyond’, for 15 days.

Awaiting the verdict

Before dawn breaks over the dense forests of Pathanamthitta, the chants begin. Barefoot men in black or blue dhotis, having observed 41 days of, climb the 18 sacred steps withon their heads and a single name on their lips. Ayyappa!For them, the journey to Sabarimala Sree Ayyappa Temple is not tourism. It is. It is discipline. It is surrender.As a larger nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court prepares to finally hear the matter once more, the hill shrine finds itself at the centre of the nation’s conscience again.It is at moments like these that faith collides with constitutional scrutiny and serenity gives way to storm, especially in a nation that calls itself secular yet often struggles to remember that secularism was meant to keep the State out of the sanctum, not to turn the sanctum into an extension of the State.The Sabarimala controversy is not just about entry. It is about whether diversity in practice can be mistaken for discrimination, and whether courts can redraw the sacred geometry of devotion.The Sabarimala shrine is dedicated to Lord Ayyappa, revered here as a, an eternal celibate. Tradition holds that women between the ages of 10 and 50, broadly the menstruating age group, do not enter this temple.The restriction is rooted in the specific form in which the deity is worshipped here.There are over a thousand other Ayyappa temples across India where women of all ages pray freely.This distinction forms the heart of the debate. Is the restriction an expression of a particular denominational practice, or is it gender discrimination disguised as custom?The legal history begins in 1990, when a petition was filed in the Kerala high court seeking enforcement of the ban. In 1991, the high court upheld the restriction, accepting it as a long-standing custom integral to the temple’s practice.For nearly 15 years thereafter, the matter rested quietly within the hills.In 2006, the Indian Young Lawyers Association approached the Supreme Court of India, arguing that barring women violated constitutional guarantees of equality and freedom of religion. By 2016, the Court began openly questioning whether such a ban could withstand constitutional scrutiny.In September 2018, a five-judge Constitution Bench delivered a 4 to 1 verdict that shook Kerala.Then Chief Justice Dipak Misra, along with Justices Rohinton Fali Nariman, AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud, held that excluding women was unconstitutional. The practice, they ruled, violated Articles 14, 15, 17 and 25. They said biological factors like menstruation could not justify exclusion. Constitutional morality, they argued, must prevail over public morality rooted in patriarchal attitudes.Justice Chandrachud observed that exclusion was destructive of liberty and equality. Justice Nariman held that superstitious beliefs extraneous to religion could not claim constitutional protection.But the lone dissent, interestingly, came from Justice Indu Malhotra. A woman.Her judgment carried a quiet warning. Courts, she said, must exercise restraint in matters of faith.Entertaining public interest litigations against religious practices could damage the secular fabric of a plural society. Article 14 alone could not be the touchstone to test religious customs. Equality in religion must be seen within the framework of that faith’s essential practices.She argued that Sabarimala devotees constituted a separate religious denomination and that the restriction was integral to their worship. Drawing a distinction from untouchability under Article 17, she said the analogy was misplaced.Her dissent resonated deeply among devotees who believed the court had stepped into sacred terrain.The verdict did not remain confined to law books. It spilt onto the streets. The Kerala government under chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan moved to implement the judgment.Massive protests erupted. Devotees blocked roads. Women journalists were turned away. Police protection became routine at the temple gates.In January 2019, two women entered the shrine under heavy security. The state witnessed widespread unrest.Meanwhile, review petitions were filed. In November 2019, a five-judge bench led by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi referred broader constitutional questions to a larger bench.The Court did not stay the 2018 judgment but acknowledged the need to examine deeper issues: What constitutes an essential religious practice? How should courts balance equality with denominational rights?On February 10, 2020, a nine-judge bench upheld the decision to examine these larger questions, expanding the scope beyond Sabarimala to include other faith based entry disputes.The debate had now grown from one hill shrine to the entire landscape of religious freedom in India.In 2026, the matter returned dramatically to centre stage. A nine-judge bench is scheduled to hear pleas relating to discrimination against women at religious places, including Sabarimala.The hearing, beginning April 7 and expected to conclude by April 22, will examine review petitions and the broader constitutional framework. The bench will hear parties supporting the review, original writ petitioners opposing it, and finally, the amicus curiae.Alongside Sabarimala, the top court will consider petitions regarding Muslim women’s entry in mosques and dargahs, entry of Parsi women in fire temples after marrying outside the community, and the Dawoodi Bohra practice of female genital mutilation.The stakes are immense. The court must decide whether it has authority to intervene in ritualistic traditions that communities consider sacred.As Kerala heads toward assembly elections, political currents swirl once more. The ruling Left government has refrained from taking a definitive stand, saying it will consult experts and clarify its position when required.Opposition parties demand clarity. Devotee organisations press for the protection of tradition.Faith and franchise intersect. Again.One of the most powerful arguments from devotees is simple: Diversity of practice is not discrimination.Across India, numerous temples follow unique customs shaped by theology, legend and regional belief. Consider a few examples.At the Attukal Bhagavathy Temple, lakhs of women gather for the Attukal Pongala festival. Men are not allowed inside the temple grounds during the ritual. It is a celebration of feminine devotion.The Chakkulathukavu Temple hosts the annual Naari Puja, where women are worshipped and men cannot enter the temple area during the ceremony.At the Kamakhya Temple, the Ambubachi Mela celebrates the menstruation of the goddess. The temple closes for three days, and certain restrictions apply, reflecting the sacredness of the event.The Santoshi Mata Temple in Jodhpur is known for traditions that restrict men from entering the inner sanctum on specific days.In each of these places, exclusion is not framed as oppression but as theological coherence. The ritual space is shaped to honour a particular spiritual meaning.The Brahma Temple has traditions linked to mythology that limit entry of married men into certain spaces. The Kanyakumari Temple maintains customs restricting men from the inner sanctum, preserving the sanctity of the goddess’s form.If such practices are expressions of diversity, devotees ask, why is Sabarimala singled out as discriminatory?This question does not dismiss equality. It asks whether equality must mean uniformity.The essential religious practice doctrine lies at the centre of the controversy. Since the Shirur Mutt case in 1954, courts have determined which practices are essential to a religion and therefore protected under Article 25.In Sabarimala, the majority in 2018 held that exclusion of women was not essential. Justice Malhotra disagreed, asserting that courts should not rationalise faith.Chief Justice Gogoi later framed the issue more broadly: Can constitutional courts step into questions involving customs that are essential to a religion but appear to violate fundamental rights?This tension between equality and denominational autonomy is not easily resolved.Constitutional morality seeks to uphold dignity and non-discrimination. Religious freedom seeks to preserve autonomy and faith. When these principles collide, judges must weigh not only law but history, sociology and theology.The nine-judge bench now has the task of evolving a coherent judicial policy for future cases involving similar conflicts.For devotees, Sabarimala is not about excluding women. Many women themselves support the traditional practice, arguing that devotion sometimes expresses itself through restraint. They see theobserved by male devotees as a form of temporary renunciation. The temple’s unique character, they argue, would be altered if its core discipline is modified.For those supporting the 2018 verdict, the issue is straightforward that no woman should be denied entry to a public temple on biological grounds. They see the restriction as patriarchal and incompatible with modern constitutional values.Between these positions lies a complex emotional terrain.The 620-kilometre Women’s Wall formed across Kerala in 2019 symbolised one side of the debate. The mass protests by Ayyappa devotees symbolised the other.Devotees gather at temples across the country to mark the beginning of the 41-day vratham observed ahead of the annual pilgrimage to the Sabarimala Sree Ayyappa Temple in Kerala. The period of austerity holds deep spiritual significance for followers of Lord Ayyappa, who undertake strict fasting, celibacy, vegetarianism and a disciplined daily routine as preparation for the arduous trek to the hill shrine.Clad in traditional black or blue attire symbolising renunciation and equality, devotees offer special prayers seeking strength, self-control and purity of mind before embarking on the sacred journey.The current hearings extend beyond one shrine. Petitions concerning Muslim women’s entry into mosques, Parsi women’s rights in fire temples, and Dawoodi Bohra practices highlight a broader question: how should India negotiate the boundary between reform and respect?If courts intervene too aggressively, they risk being seen as arbiters of theology. If they withdraw completely, genuine injustices may persist unchecked.The Sabarimala case has become a prism through which India examines its constitutional soul.As April hearings approach, the nation watches again. The nine-judge bench will hear review petitioners, respondents and the amicus within a fixed timeline. Its judgment could reshape the boundaries of religious freedom.For Kerala, on the cusp of elections, the issue is political. For devotees, it is personal. For scholars, it is constitutional.Yet beneath argument and analysis lies a simple truth. Temples are not mere structures but vessels of memory. Those who climb Sabarimala carry an inheritance as much as an offering.Whatever the bench decides, the question now runs deeper than entry. It asks whether a civilisation that values diversity can defend equality without erasing difference.","The sabarimala shrine is dedicated to lord ayyappa, revered here as a, an eternal celibate. Tradition holds that women between the ages of 10 and 50, broadly the menstruating age group, do not enter this temple. The debate is about whether diversity in practice can be mistaken for discrimination.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128781646,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-137308,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) has filed a prosecution sanction order against former Union Finance Minister P Chidambaram in connection with the alleged money laundering offence in the Aircel-Maxis deal, placing the order before the Special Court under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) at Rouse Avenue, New Delhi.The ED has also placed a separate prosecution sanction order in connection with the INX Media money laundering case before the same Special Court.In a post on social media platform X on Thursday evening, the ED said, “ED has placed prosecution sanction order received from the Competent Authority against Shri. P Chidambaram, the then Union Finance Minister in respect of the offence of money laundering in the Aircel Maxis Deal, before the Ld. Special Court.”The agency also issued a detailed press release stating that the sanction was obtained from the competent authority to prosecute Chidambaram as a public servant and has now been submitted before the Special Court to expedite the pending trial. These prosecution sanction orders have been placed before the Rouse Avenue Special Court in the national capital to fast-track proceedings in both the Aircel-Maxis and INX Media cases.The move comes in the backdrop of a November 6, 2024 judgment of the Supreme Court in “Directorate of Enforcement vs Bibhu Prasad Acharya & Ors.” (Criminal Appeal Nos. 4314-4316 of 2024), which held that prosecution sanction under Section 197(1) of the CrPC is applicable to complaints filed under Section 44(1)(b) of the PMLA as well.According to the ED, after the apex court’s ruling, several accused persons charged under the PMLA challenged trial proceedings in various legal forums, causing delays. To comply with the judgment and avoid further delay, the agency said it initiated remedial action by seeking prosecution sanctions in all pending complaints involving public servants.In Chidambaram’s case, the sanction was sought from the competent authority and obtained on February 10, 2026, in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling, along with an order under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (corresponding to Section 218 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023), for prosecuting him in respect of the alleged offence of money laundering.The prosecution sanction order has now been placed before the Special Court (PMLA), Rouse Avenue, to expedite the trial, the ED said.The ED initiated an investigation under the PMLA in ECIR/05/DZ/2012, based on FIR No. RC-DAI-2011-A-0022 dated October 9, 2011, registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in 2011 in the Aircel-Maxis case.The CBI FIR alleged offences under Sections 120-B and 420 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 8, 13(2) and 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.According to the ED, its investigation revealed that Chidambaram, as the then Finance Minister, granted Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) approval to the Aircel-Maxis deal in 2006 “in lieu of quid pro quo.”In the deal, the foreign investor Maxis had sought government approval for foreign direct investment (FDI) of $800 million (Rs 3,565.91 crore). The ED alleged that the competent authority for approving such an investment was the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), as the amount exceeded Rs 600 crore.However, it claimed that approval was “fraudulently and dishonestly granted” on March 20, 2006 by Chidambaram, who was competent to approve FDI proposals involving investments of Rs 600 crore or less.The ED further alleged that illegal gratification amounting to Rs 1.16 crore was received by Karti P Chidambaram in his companies, M/s Advantage Strategic Consulting Pvt. Ltd. (ASCPL) and M/s Chess Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (CMSPL).The agency said its investigation revealed financial transactions between P Chidambaram and Karti P Chidambaram and that funds of ASCPL were spent “for and on behalf of P Chidambaram.”Proceeds of crime amounting to Rs 1.16 crore were provisionally attached through a Provisional Attachment Order dated September 23, 2017. The attachment was confirmed by the Adjudicating Authority on March 12, 2018.Subsequently, a prosecution complaint under Sections 44 and 45 read with Sections 3 and 4 of the PMLA was filed on June 13, 2018, followed by a supplementary prosecution complaint on October 25, 2018, before the Special Court (PMLA), Rouse Avenue, where Chidambaram was arraigned as accused number A-6.The Special Court, by its order dated November 27, 2021, took cognisance of the offence of money laundering.In the INX Media matter, the ED initiated investigation under PMLA in ECIR/07/HIU/2017 based on FIR No. RC2202017 E 0011 dated May 15, 2017, registered by the CBI against INX Media Pvt Ltd, INX News Pvt Ltd, Karti P Chidambaram and others.The agency alleged that FIPB approval was granted to INX Media Pvt Ltd during P Chidambaram’s tenure as Union Finance Minister and that, in consideration for granting and subsequently regularising the approval, illegal gratification was demanded and received through entities beneficially owned and controlled by Karti P Chidambaram.According to the ED, the funds were routed through shell companies including ASCPL and associated entities, layered through complex transactions across multiple jurisdictions, and later invested in shares of Vasan Health Care Pvt Ltd and AGS Health Care Pvt Ltd, before being multiplied through sale of shares and overseas investments.The total proceeds of crime in the INX Media case have been quantified at approximately Rs 65.88 crore. Proceeds of crime amounting to Rs 53.93 crore (attached on October 10, 2018) and Rs 11.04 crore (attached on March 31, 2023) have been provisionally attached and confirmed by the Adjudicating Authority.A prosecution complaint in the INX Media case was filed before the Special Court (PMLA), Rouse Avenue on June 1, 2020, and cognisance was taken on March 24, 2021, wherein P Chidambaram (Accused-1), Karti P Chidambaram (Accused-7) and eight others were arrayed as accused. A supplementary prosecution complaint was later filed on December 16, 2024.With the latest sanctions in the Aircel-Maxis and INX Media matters now placed before the Special Court, the ED said it has been making “all efforts to fast track the trial” in the cases.",The directorate of enforcement (ed) has filed a prosecution sanction order against former union finance minister p chidambaram.

DGCA issues new refund rules: Airlines to offer 48-hour look-in period to make changes & refunds to be made within 14 days,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dgca-issues-new-refund-rules-airlines-to-offer-48-hour-look-in-period-to-make-changes-refunds-to-be-made-within-14-days/articleshow/128820433.cms,"Photo credit: IANS

NEW DELHI: Airlines will now provide a “look-in option” for a period of 48 hours after booking a ticket during which a passenger can cancel or amend the ticket without any additional charges, except fare difference, if the departure date is at least 7 and 15 days hence for domestic and international flights, respectively. Airlines will need to ensure refunds within 14 days and they will no longer be allowed to levy any charge for a name correction being made within 24 hours of the booking being made on their website.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has from Thursday revised refund rules and introduced passenger-friendly measures in what is often a painful process for travellers. “In case of purchase of ticket through travel agent/portal, onus of refund shall lie with airlines as agents are their appointed representatives. Airlines shall ensure that the refund process is completed within 14 working days,” the amended rules issued by DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai say.“In the event of ticket cancellations due to a medical emergency, where the passenger or a family member listed on the same PNR gets admitted/hospitalised during the travel period, airlines may provide either a refund or a credit shell. For all other situations, refunds will be issued once an opinion on the passenger's fitness to travel certificate is received from an airline’s aerospace medicine specialist/ DGCA empanelled aerospace medicine specialist,” reads another amendment introduced in the rules.The regulator has ruled that airlines “shall not levy any additional charge for correction in the name of the same person when the error is pointed out by the passenger within 24 hours of making the booking, when the ticket is booked directly through the airline website.”About the 48-hour lock-in period, the amended rule says: “During this period passengers can cancel or amend the ticket without any additional charges, except for the normal prevailing fare for the revised flight for which the ticket is sought to be amended. This facility shall not be available for a flight whose departure is less than 7 days for domestic flight and 15 days for international flight from booking date when ticket is booked directly through the airline website. Beyond 48 hours of initial booking time, this option is not available and the passenger has to pay the relevant cancellation fees for amendment.”The move to make the process a little passenger-friendly comes as the regulator admits: “The issue of refund of tickets by airlines has become a major source of grievance amongst passengers.” A majority of the complaints are about: Delay in refund of unused tickets; amount refunded against cancelled tickets; not refunding ticket amount but asking passengers to use that money to make another booking in a stipulated time period.“While govt is committed not to interfere in the commercial practices of airlines, the volume of the complaints necessitates some affirmative action to safeguard the interest of the traveling public. The matter has been discussed in several meetings with the airlines with no improvement in the system adopted by airlines for refund of tickets. It is now considered that the onus rests with govt to fix some minimum benchmarks, as far as the refund policy is concerned in order to stem the growing dissatisfaction among the passengers regarding the refund procedures adopted by some airlines,” the regulator says.",The directorate general of civil aviation (dgca) has from thursday revised refund rules. Airlines will no longer be allowed to levy any charge for a name correction being made within 24 hours of the booking being made on their website.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128820538,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-326984,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Effort To Protect Assam’s Identity, Says Himanta Defending ‘Miyan’ Remark

NEW DELHI: The Gauhati high court on Thursday issued a notice to Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma regarding multiple PILs that allege he made “hate speech.”A division bench, consisting of Chief Justice Ashutosh Kumar and Justice Arun Dev Choudhury, heard the three petitions. Notices were also issued to the Assam government and the Director General of Police.The court scheduled the next hearing for April 21.""The respondents have to reply to the notices before the next date. The court has not issued any other order,"" advocate Santanu Borthakur, who assisted the counsels for one of the petitioners, told PTI.The petitioners include the political parties CPI and CPI(M), each of which filed separate petitions, as well as a joint petition by Sahitya Akademi awardee Hiren Gohain, former DGP Harekrishna Deka, and senior journalist Paresh Malakar.Gohain, Deka, and Malakar submitted their petition on February 24, while the CPI and CPI(M) had filed their separate petitions earlier, on February 21, concerning the same issue.Earlier, the Supreme Court had refused, on February 16, to entertain petitions seeking action against Sarma in a similar matter.The petitioners alleged that Sarma’s remarks could ""divide society"" and constituted ""blatant hate speech"" against a minority community in Assam.They claimed he directed party members to file complaints against Bengali-origin Muslims, derogatorily referred to as ""Miyas,"" to cause them harassment.The PIL stated that Sarma has been instigating social and economic boycotts, propagating harmful stereotypes, and encouraging civilians to take law and order into their own hands. It also alleged that he has used his office to harass the minority community and incite communal disharmony.The petitioners demanded a complete cessation of such hate speech, an inquiry by a Special Investigation Team (SIT) chaired by a retired high court judge, and appropriate action against Sarma. They noted that despite publicly recorded speeches suggesting incitement, no FIR had been registered, creating a climate of impunity.","The gauhati high court issued a notice to assam chief minister himanta biswa sarma.

Sunetra Pawar To Be Named NCP Leader, Dy CM Oath Likely Tomorrow: Chhagan Bhujbal

NEW DELHI: The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Thursday formally elected Maharashtra deputy chief minister Sunetra Pawar as its new national president, nearly a month after the death of her husband, Ajit Pawar, who held both positions at the time.Ajit Pawar died in a private plane crash in his hometown of Baramati on January 28. The crash also claimed the lives of his personal security officer, both pilots, and a flight attendant, leaving no survivors.On January 31, the NCP unanimously elected Sunetra Pawar as the leader of its legislative party, another position where she succeeded Ajit. Hours later, she was sworn in as Maharashtra’s deputy chief minister. With six terms the late NCP boss was the state’s longest-serving deputy CM.""The NCP is my family and I will not leave any section of society behind. We will move ahead by taking everyone along,"" she told party office-bearers and workers soon afterwards, PTI reported.""I have seen Ajitdada strive throughout his life for the development of Maharashtra. We will not let his dream remain unfulfilled...Together we will accomplish it,"" she added.Sunetra Pawar made her electoral debut in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, contesting the Baramati seat against Ajit’s cousin, Supriya Sule, who retained the constituency—a longtime stronghold of the Pawar family—winning her fourth consecutive term.The NCP subsequently nominated Sunetra Pawar to the Rajya Sabha. To continue as deputy CM, she has six months to secure election as a Maharashtra MLA or MLC.","Ajit pawar died in a private plane crash in his hometown of baramati on january 28.

The Supreme Court on Thursday heard a Special Leave Petition (SLP) filed by an individual challenging the modern gas crematorium established at the Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore, in a matter earlier dismissed by the Madras High Court.During the hearing, the Chief Justice of India described Isha’s service as “pious work” and suggested that an arrangement regarding alternate land to the petitioner could be mediated between the parties.The Supreme Court noted that the petitioner had already sold part of his land to Isha Foundation but contended that the sale was not intended for constructing a crematorium. The bench advised both sides to hold discussions and explore an amicable settlement regarding the adjoining land, and both parties agreed to resolve the matter through negotiations.During the hearing, Advocate Prashant Bhushan, representing the petitioner, argued that the crematorium was causing a nuisance, with bodies being cremated daily over the past couple of weeks, and violated local rules prohibiting crematoriums or burial grounds near a dwelling or water body without a Gram Panchayat license. He also highlighted that the petitioner’s house is in a tribal area where burial, rather than cremation, is the customary practice, and that the bodies brought to the crematorium were from Coimbatore city, around 30 km away.The apex court appointed retired Madras High Court judge Rajendran as mediator for this purpose.The Madras High Court had earlier dismissed the case, observing that “the petitioner has no legal grounds. The gasifier crematorium has been built with proper panchayat permission and within the rules. Furthermore, the construction of a crematorium, especially a gas crematorium, serves the society; it cannot be called against public interest.”The foundation stated that residents from over five village panchayats surrounding the Isha Yoga Center had requested authorities to establish a crematorium in the area. It said the Isha Foundation subsequently set up the modern gasifier crematorium after securing panchayat approval and necessary clearances from the concerned government departments, including the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board.Isha Foundation said that it has been operating and maintaining crematoriums across Tamil Nadu since 2010 with the objective of providing “Dignity in Death”. It currently maintains 30 crematoriums in areas including Chennai’s Besant Nagar, Coimbatore, Neyveli, Vellore and Thanjavur.","The supreme court on thursday heard a special leave petition (slp) challenging the modern gas crematorium established at the isha yoga center in coimbatore.
