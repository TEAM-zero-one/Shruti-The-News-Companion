Centre pushes PPP medical colleges nationwide; 11 projects get nod under new funding model,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-pushes-ppp-medical-colleges-nationwide-11-projects-get-nod-under-new-funding-model/articleshow/125825350.cms,"Representative image (ANI Photo)

NEW DELHI: India’s push to expand medical education into underserved districts has entered a new phase, with the Centre revealing in the Lok Sabha that 11 new medical colleges have received in-principle approval under a Public–Private Partnership ( PPP ) model. These colleges will come up by upgrading district hospitals — a shift in strategy aimed at accelerating MBBS seat creation without waiting for full government-backed infrastructure.The projects cleared so far are spread across Jharkhand (Giridih, Dhanbad, Jamtara, Khunti), Arunachal Pradesh (Namsai) and Uttar Pradesh (Baghpat, Mainpuri, Hathras, Kasganj, Mahoba, Hamirpur).The government explained that the model will rely on Viability Gap Funding (VGF) — a financial support mechanism designed to make socially important but commercially unviable projects feasible for private partners. Under the scheme, the Centre may fund up to 30% of the project cost, with states allowed to match this amount. For pilot projects, support can go up to 40% of the cost, plus 25% of operations-and-maintenance expenses for the first five years.In return, States must allow full and free access to district hospital facilities for the attached medical colleges and must provide land on concessional terms — conditions aimed at ensuring that medical education does not dilute public-hospital services.The Lok Sabha reply also stressed that faculty norms, curriculum rules, equipment standards and staffing requirements will remain under the National Medical Commission’s Minimum Standard Requirement (MSR) Regulations, ensuring that PPP colleges follow the same quality benchmarks as government medical colleges.Alongside the PPP push, the government also confirmed that the existing Centrally Sponsored Scheme for upgrading district hospitals into government medical colleges has already sanctioned all 157 planned institutions, including 14 in Madhya Pradesh and two in Maharashtra.While the PPP model is still at an early stage, the approval of 11 projects signals the Centre’s intent to create a parallel pathway for strengthening medical infrastructure, especially in districts that have historically lacked teaching hospitals.The next challenge lies in execution — from faculty recruitment to readiness of hospital facilities — but policymakers say the new structure opens a crucial opportunity to expand medical education faster, in areas that need it most.",India’s push to expand medical education into underserved districts has entered a new phase. 11 new medical colleges have received in-principle approval under a public–private partnership ( ppp ) model.

In repeated burglary cakewalks, thieves have been raiding a Nadiad confectionery, Krishna Dairy Products, and have had criminally sweet success 10 times in nine years. The shop's owner, Mukesh Pandit, 44, said the burglars seem to treat money only as a light dessert. ""Most of the time, thieves took some cash but loads of mithai - to the tune of quintals,"" he said.Pandit, who opened the shop in 2015, told TOI, ""I filed complaints three times. Police merely made 'janva jog' (station diary entries). None of the burglaries were cracked."" He installed CCTVs to signal the sour consequences of pilferage, but burglars thought the digital video recorder is the cherry on top of their booty and nicked that too. ""Before I could reinstall CCTVs, burglars struck again,"" Pandit said. ""I have done everything to stop burglaries, from putting up iron grills to placing high-tech cameras. """"A point outside my shop has a police picket. But during VVIP visits and festivals, the cops leave to join bandobusts. The burglaries occur on these days,"" he said. The latest theft was on Nov 30, during which burglars stole 12kg of kaju katri worth Rs 12,000, 73.5kg of mixed mawa sweets worth Rs 38,200, and 35kg of shrikhand worth Rs 13,300. Other purloined items were mixed biscuits worth Rs 15,000, 70kg of namkeen worth Rs 16,800, and Rs 3,500 in cash.

Former CJI B.R. Gavai Clarifies He Never Faced Political Or Executive Pressure During His Tenure

CHANDIGARH: In a significant push for modernising the country's prison ecosystem, CJI Surya Kant has advocated bold, tech-integrated reforms, ranging from digital-skills training to UK-style inmate-monitoring systems, aimed at transforming prisons from punitive spaces into ""engines of reintegration"".Highlighting the need to align prison training with the ""economy of tomorrow"", the CJI stressed that inmates must be equipped with digital competencies, logistics expertise, & modern vocational skills. He urged deeper industry collaboration, proposing a model where companies ""adopt"" prisons, offer apprenticeships, & eventually recruit trained inmates, turning ability into opportunity.CJI Kant was speaking on correctional reforms in Gurgaon on Saturday while inaugurating skill development and polytechnic courses inside Haryana jails.While giving one of his four ""thoughtful proposals"" to strengthen correctional justice framework, the CJI said that the suggestion is regarding opening or establishing either the open jails or just following paradigm shift that has taken place in the United Kingdom with the help of a software company based in Bangalore, where a chip is provided to the convicts, who are allowed to stay at homes within defined radius.""Their movements are monitored through advanced software, ensuring compliance while allowing individuals to maintain family life, emotional bonds, financial stability, and continuity for their children, often the 'invisible victims' of incarceration,"" the CJI said.The CJI also pushed for creating or expanding open prisons in India as part of this humane rethinking of criminal justice.He concluded by reminding that data-driven reforms are essential. ""A modern incarceration system must track behavioural progress and post-release trajectories, ensuring that rehabilitation is measurable, accountable, and effective. Such a system, he said, would help measure the real effectiveness of rehabilitation programmes and reduce recidivism,"" he said.The CJI said that when individuals step out of prison and return to society without adequate support, their reintegration becomes not only difficult but dangerously uncertain. Without guidance, many are pulled back into a cycle of marginalisation and renewed conflict with the law. He said that in the absence of education, skills, psychological support, and structured reintegration, a prison, what he prefers to call a ""correctional home"", can unintentionally become a place where disadvantages deepen and custodial cycles repeat.Reformative justice today demands clear thinking, coordinated action, and systems designed for renewal rather than return, he said.CJI Kant has long been known for championing correctional reforms for jail inmates. Even during his tenure as a judge of Punjab and Haryana high court, he delivered a landmark judgment in the Jasbir Singh case, holding that the right of convicts or jail inmates to have conjugal visits - or alternatively to seek artificial insemination for progeny - is a Fundamental Right.Justices Ahsanuddin Amanullah, Rajesh Bindal and Augustine George Masih of SC and Sheel Nagu, chief justice of Punjab and Haryana HC, HC judge Justice Lisa Gill and executive chairperson, Haryana State Legal Services Authority, along with Judges of HC and other dignitaries from the state administration, attended the programme.","Cji surya kant has advocated bold, tech-integrated reforms.

Goa: 23 Killed In Arpora Nightclub Fire; Cylinder Blast Suspected, CM Sawant Vows Strict Action

PANAJI: Fifteen minutes. That's all it took for Bhavana Joshi to lose her husband and three sisters inside a nightclub that was supposed to crown a holiday in Goa with music and laughter for the family of five from Ghaziabad and Delhi. Flames tore through the club moments after they had stepped into Birch by Romeo Lane in Arpora late Saturday.Bhavana lived. The other four didn't. Her husband Vinod Kumar pushed her through the main entrance as panic broke loose, police said. She stumbled into the open, coughing, burning-eyed, alive. Then he turned back. Inside were Bhavana's three sisters, Anita, Saroj and Kamala, who had travelled with them for a short break that began on Dec 4. He went after them. Fire swallowed them all.Outside, Bhavana waited. She kept dialling Vinod's phone. It rang. Again and again. When the body was carried out, her phone was clenched in her hand, still calling out. The family of five had been staying at a hotel in Baga.What began as a leisure trip ended at a police barricade outside a blackened club, with hotel staff trying to comfort a woman who no longer had a family beside her.Relatives rushed to Goa through the night. ""Their children are waiting at home. All their relatives are waiting too,"" a family member said. ""We haven't told them that all four have died. We have only said two sisters are dead and the other two are missing. We want to take their bodies back."" Another relative held up a phone, trembling.""Look at this picture of my sister-in-law. She is completely charred. She has no skin left.""For Bhavana, the holiday ended in a circle of police tape and silence - saved by a man who walked back into fire so that others might live. Now only she remains to tell the children how their parents' last night together ended in minutes, and how love chose the flames.","Bhavana joshi, her husband and three sisters were killed in a goa nightclub fire.

NEW DELHI: A thick blanket of smog covered Delhi on Saturday morning, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 333 at 7 am, placing it in the ‘very poor’ category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). While there has been a slight improvement compared to recent weeks, many parts of the city remained shrouded in dense haze.Areas including Ghazipur Mandi, Anand Vihar, and Wazirpur experienced severely reduced visibility due to the smog. CPCB data showed Anand Vihar recording an AQI of 366, Sonia Vihar 352, Wazirpur 359, and Ghazipur Mandi 366, all in the ‘very poor’ range. Bawana recorded the highest AQI at 375 at 7 am, while NSIT Dwarka measured 260, categorised as ‘poor’.The India Gate and Kartavya Path areas were also covered in smog, with the AQI in the region at 311, falling under the ‘very poor’ category.According to the AQI scale, 0–50 is ‘good’, 51–100 ‘satisfactory’, 101–200 ‘moderate’, 201–300 ‘poor’, 301–400 ‘very poor’, and 401–500 ‘severe’.In response to the worsening air quality, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change issued a statement on Friday following a question raised by MP Dr.Laxmikant Bajpayee in the Rajya Sabha. He had asked whether it was true that “one in every seven deaths in Delhi can be attributed to the city’s toxic air as claimed by several studies and reported in the media.”Minister of State Kirti Vardhan Singh replied that various studies have been conducted by academic and research institutes on the impact of air pollution. He added that in 2025, the AQI in Delhi had not reached the ‘severe plus’ level on any day.The government continues to take measures to tackle pollution in Delhi-NCR. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), established under the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas Act, 2021, oversees air quality in Delhi and neighbouring regions.The Commission has been working collaboratively with all major stakeholders to reduce pollution. It has issued 95 statutory directions to guide action against air pollution and has prepared a Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) to manage pollution during peak winter months. Stricter emission norms for polluting activities in the NCR have also been implemented, and regular review meetings are held to monitor progress.","A thick blanket of smog covered delhi on saturday morning, with the average air quality index (aqi) at 333 at 7 am.

PM Modi Calls Vande Mataram A ‘Mantra Of Unity And Courage’ As The Song Completes 150 Years

Why it’s in the news now



Origins of Bande Mataram (1870s–1880s)



Song’s literary context: Anandamath

The Mother that was – glorious and mighty The Mother that is – suffering and oppressed The Mother that will be – restored to strength and glory

From song to slogan: Birth of a nationalist cry (1900–1910)



Swadeshi and anti-partition movement

Boycott movements Protest marches Newspapers and political groups carrying its name

Figures who popularised it included:

Rabindranath Tagore

Bipin Chandra Pal

Sri Aurobindo

British repression

Fines for students

Police lathi-charges

Bans on marches

Threats of expulsion from schools and colleges

The song and the Indian National Congress



1937 CWC decision: Were the stanzas removed?



Did it 'sow seeds of partition'?



What the 1937 CWC actually said

The first two stanzas had become widely used and carried no controversial imagery.

The remaining stanzas contained “allusions and a religious ideology” inconsistent with the beliefs of other religious groups.

Only the first two stanzas should be sung at national gatherings.

Organisers were free to choose additional songs if they wished.

Constituent assembly: Equal honour, equal status (1950)

Jana Gana Mana would be the national anthem.

Vande Mataram, because of its historic role, would be honoured equally and accorded equal status.

The debate today



Why is the BJP reviving the issue?

Why is the Congress defensive?

The 1937 decision was guided by inclusivity, not division.

The BJP is weaponising history to distract from contemporary governance failures.

Tagore and the freedom movement need protecting from political revisionism.

What Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind has to say



Vande Mataram

Parliament will begin a special discussion in the Lok Sabha on Monday to commemorate 150 years of Vande Mataram, a song that remains one of the most debated symbols of India’s freedom struggle.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will open the debate, with defence minister Rajnath Singh scheduled to conclude it. The BJP has been given three hours in the Lok Sabha, the total debate will span nearly ten hours. The Rajya Sabha will hold its discussion the next day, to be opened by Union home minister Amit Shah.The commemoration is not merely ceremonial. It arrives amid renewed political sparring over the song’s historical evolution, religious imagery, and the choices made by India’s pre-independence national leadership. What began as a patriotic hymn in a Bengali novel is once again a focal point of fierce political messaging, competing historical narratives, and questions about national identity.This explainer traces the 150-year journey of Vande Mataram—from its birth in Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay’s writing to its role in nationalism, the Congress’s 1937 decision to officially use only its first two stanzas, and its recognition in the Constituent Assembly as having “equal honour and status” with the National Anthem.The upcoming debate is part of a special parliamentary focus on the legacy of Vande Mataram. But the political temperature was raised last month, during the commemoration event of 150 years of the national song, when Prime Minister Modi accused the Congress of having “removed important stanzas” from the original song during its 1937 Faizabad session, claiming this decision “sowed the seeds of partition.”According to the Prime Minister, the Congress’s move amounted to breaking the national song into pieces—an act that abandoned its original spirit and undermined unity. He has framed the issue within his broader narrative of 'Viksit Bharat', tying cultural heritage to national development.The Congress hit back immediately. Citing The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi (Vol66, p46), the party argued that the 1937 decision was not an act of division, but a sensitive accommodation recommended by a Working Committee that included Mahatama Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, Subhas Chandra Bose, Rajendra Prasad, Abul Kalam Azad, Sarojini Naidu, and other iconic leaders. The CWC noted that the first two stanzas were already the only widely sung and nationally recognised part, while the remaining contained religious imagery that some citizens objected to.The Congress also emphasised that the decision drew from the advice of Rabindranath Tagore, who had himself sung Vande Mataram at the 1896 Congress session.In its rebuttal, the party accused the prime minister of attacking the legacy of India’s freedom movement while avoiding present-day issues such as unemployment, inequality, and foreign policy challenges.This political exchange has made the upcoming parliamentary debate all the more charged.The PIB’s historical account helps clarify the origins of the song. According to Sri Aurobindo’s writing in the English daily Bande Mataram (16 April 1907), Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay composed the song around 1875. It was published more widely when Bankim’s novel Anandamath began serialization in the Bengali magazine Bangadarshan in March–April 1881.Anandamath is built around a group of ascetic warriors, the Santanas, who dedicate themselves to freeing the motherland from oppression. Their devotion is entirely to Bharat Mata, envisioned not as a religious deity but as a personified motherland.In the temple of the Santanas stand three images of the Mother:For Aurobindo, the hymn embodied the essence of “the religion of patriotism.”Many later critics, however, would argue that the imagery—particularly in the later stanzas—draws from Hindu goddess symbolism that may not be inclusive of all communities.By the early 20th century, Vande Mataram had escaped its literary origins and become one of the most electrifying symbols of Indian nationalism.After Lord Curzon’s 1905 partition of Bengal, the song became the rallying cry for:In 1906, at Barisal, more than 10,000 Hindus and Muslims together marched shouting Vande Mataram—a testament to its early cross-communal appeal.Aurobindo’s writings in Bande Mataram (the newspaper) turned the phrase into a political and spiritual exhortation for self-rule.Alarmed by its galvanising effect, the colonial government tried repeatedly to suppress it through:From Bengal to Bombay Presidency, chanting Vande Mataram became synonymous with nationalist defiance.In 1907, Madam Bhikaji Cama unfurled the first tricolour abroad—in Stuttgart—with the words Vande Mataram emblazoned across it.The Congress adopted Vande Mataram not just culturally, but ceremonially.1896 —First Congress rendition: At the Calcutta session, Rabindranath Tagore sang the song, giving it national prominence.1905 — Nationwide adoption: At the Varanasi session, the Congress formally adopted Vande Mataram for all-India occasions. This was during the peak of the Swadeshi struggle, when the song had become the soundtrack of political awakening.Yes.By the 1930s, debates around the song’s religious imagery had become politically relevant. India’s nationalist leadership wanted to keep the movement inclusive, and Muslim leaders raised objections to certain stanzas that invoked Hindu goddesses.No.The CWC's decision was more inclusive than divisive in nature.The eventual decision to restrict Vande Mataram to its first two stanzas drew directly from this history of selective popular usage. As the Committee noted, only the opening verses — celebrating the land’s beauty and abundance in gentle, inclusive imagery — had organically acquired national significance over the decades.The remaining stanzas were scarcely known, rarely sung, and contained religious allusions and ideological references that many felt were inconsistent with the beliefs of other communities. The CWC explicitly acknowledged the “validity of the objections raised by Muslim friends” to those portions.While emphasising that the song’s modern, unifying role in national life mattered far more than its origins in a historical novel, the committee concluded that only the first two stanzas should be sung at national gatherings.This, they argued, preserved the unifying spirit the song had come to embody while avoiding elements that could alienate sections of India’s diverse society.The CWC’s statement, issued between October 26–November 1 in Kolkata, recorded:The committee explicitly said that the modern national use of the first two stanzas was more important than the song’s original placement in a religiously infused novel.Tagore had long argued that when a cultural symbol is used nationally, it must not exclude or alienate. His views shaped the committee’s decision and remain central to the Congress’s defence today.When the Constituent Assembly met to choose India’s national symbols, there was no dispute between Jana Gana Mana and Vande Mataram.In his statement on January 24, 1950, DrRajendra Prasad, President of the Assembly, declared:There was applause; no member raised objections.This dual recognition was meant to preserve both inclusivity and historical memory: the anthem would represent national unity, while Vande Mataram’s legacy would be canonised as part of India’s freedom story.For the ruling party, Vande Mataram is a civilizational invocation that predates partisan politics. The BJP frames the 1937 Congress decision as overly accommodative, even compromising, and often ties this critique to a larger argument about “appeasement.”In the government’s view, celebrating 150 years of the song is part of a project to reaffirm cultural pride and national self-confidence.The Congress insists it is the party that first elevated the song, sang it at historic moments, and fought the British under its banner. It argues that:The Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, led by Maulana Mahmood Madani, has taken a clear and consistent position on thedebate: it accepts the first two stanzas as historically validated for national use but firmly rejects the remaining verses on theological grounds.Madani argued that the full composition contains imagery — particularly the depiction of the motherland as the goddess Durga — that conflicts with Islamic monotheism, making it impermissible for Muslims to recite.""He stated that Vande Mataram in its complete form is rooted in shirkiya aqaaid (polytheistic beliefs). Particularly, in the remaining four stanzas, the motherland is depicted as the goddess Durga and addressed with words of worship — concepts that clearly conflict with the Islamic belief in the oneness of God.

NEW DELHI: IndiGo flight disruptions have entered their sixth day, with the airline expecting to stabilise operations by December 10. The ongoing crisis has caused widespread inconvenience, as cancellations, flight delays, and other major operational issues have left multiple passengers across major cities stranded at airports.However, the airline has announced plans to operate over 1,650 flights by the end of the day and assured that refunds are being processed fully. The civil aviation ministry said that refunds totalling Rs 610 crore have been processed so far following IndiGo flight disruptions, news agency PTI reported.Here are the top developmentsIndiGo cancelled 650 flights on Sunday and plans to operate 1,650 of its 2,300 daily flights on December 7, as disruptions entered their sixth consecutive day. More than 220 flights were cancelled across the Delhi and Mumbai airports, even as efforts continued to stabilise operations. The ongoing crisis has led to hundreds of cancellations and delays in recent days, causing significant hardship for thousands of passengers.According to news agency PTI, at least 112 flights were cancelled at Mumbai airport and 109 at Delhi airport on Sunday. This follows a turbulent few days for the airline.After cancelling around 1,600 of its 2,300 daily flights on Friday, disruptions eased slightly on Saturday, with cancellations dropping to approximately 800.IndiGo also cancelled nine flights at the MBB Airport on Sunday, an airport official confirmed. “Due to the ongoing problem, IndiGo has cancelled nine scheduled flights, including both arrivals and departures, from MBB Airport on Sunday. It will, however, operate two flights as scheduled,” MBB Airport Director KM Nehra said.IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers on Sunday said the airline will operate around 1,650 flights during the day as operations gradually stabilise after several days of large-scale cancellations and delays that caused hardship to thousands of passengers across the country.In an internal video message to staff from the airline’s operational control centre, Elbers said the airline’s On Time Performance (OTP) is expected to be around 75 per cent on Sunday. “Today, we have realised further improvements of the system in order to reach around 1,650 flights,” he said.Explaining steps taken to reduce passenger inconvenience, the CEO added, “We have been able to execute the cancellations at an earlier stage so that the customers do not show up at the airport in case their flights are cancelled.”According to IndiGo, 137 out of its 138 destinations are in operation today.Thousands of passengers remain affected due to massive cancellations, delays and other operational issues. Many passengers lost their temper with the ground staff at the airports. Various videos circulating online show passengers getting aggressive with staff.Flyers across various airports also shared accounts of getting stuck at the airport, disrupting their plans. A passenger at the Delhi airport shared how he was expected to return on Friday but was stuck at the Patna airport only touched down in Delhi on Sunday.Amid the chaos, some passengers also tried to keep up the spirit of their fellow crisis-bearers by recreational activities like singing and dancing.The government on Saturday cracked the whip on IndiGo and other airlines for charging exorbitant fares amid mass cancellations, capping domestic airfares at Rs 18,000 (UDF, passenger security fees, and taxes extra).In a late evening meeting, civil aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha summoned IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers and other top officials to Rajiv Gandhi Bhawan and gave the airline two days instead of the 21 sought by the carrier to fully restore operations. The ministry invoked the Bharatiya Vayuyan Adhiniyam, using its powers directly rather than leaving the matter to the aviation regulator, DGCA.IndiGo, which controls 60% of domestic traffic, has been ordered to ensure refunds for cancelled tickets by 8pm on December 7 and return checked-in baggage within two days.The airline has also been barred from charging any rescheduling fees, which it had been levying despite failing for over a month to adhere to new flying time norms for pilots and crew.The civil aviation regulator gave a one-time extension till 6 pm on Monday (December 8) after IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers and COO–accountable manager Isidre Porqueras sought more time to submit a detailed response.The airline cited the scale of its network and multiple unavoidable factors behind recent operational disruptions while requesting the extension beyond the original 24-hour deadline.DGCA warned that no further extension will be allowed and failure to respond in time will lead to ex-parte action, while it continues to closely monitor passenger safety and regulatory compliance.IndiGo expects to gain back some stability by December 10, as per reports by the news agency PTI. The airline also issued an apology letter stating it expected to operate 1,500 flights by the end of Sunday.""Today, we are on our way to operate over 1500 flights by the end of the day,"" said IndiGo in their notice, ""With regards to destinations, over 95% of network connectivity has already been re-established as we are able to operate to 135 out of the existing 138 destinations in operations""As per the official statement by the airlines, the Board of Directors met on the first day the flight cancellations and delays began, and was given a detailed briefing by the management on the scale of the crisis.The company said the Board later held an internal session where it decided to establish a Crisis Management Group comprising the chairman, directors and CEO Pieter Elbers.According to the company, the group has been meeting regularly and receiving continuous updates on measures to restore normal operations, with additional telephonic consultations held with other Board members.Union minister of state for civil aviation and cooperation, Murlidhar Mohol, on Sunday, assured that the centre is monitoring the IndiGo flight disruptions seriously and immediate actions will be taken against the airlines after the investigation committee's report is submitted.The statement comes in light of the airlines not adhering to the Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL). The minister also noted the ""mental harassment"" being borne by the passengers affected.""All passengers have suffered mental distress and have had to face many difficulties. They had to endure mental harassment because of IndiGo,"" said the minister.The Railways has announced 89 special trains to operate across all zones over the next three days, beginning Saturday, to assist passengers affected by IndiGo’s large-scale flight cancellations. Officials said the trains, arranged at short notice after reviewing traffic conditions in major cities including New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Patna and Howrah, will together make more than 100 trips.They added that efforts are being made to widely publicise the special services, with some railway divisions sharing information at nearby airports to guide stranded travellers. The South Eastern Railway has also requested airport authorities to display details of the newly introduced special trains.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has issued a show-cause notice to IndiGo Chief Executive Officer Pieter Elbers, holding the airline responsible for the large-scale operational disruptions seen in recent days and citing “significant lapses in planning, oversight and resource management.”The aviation regulator on Saturday asked the CEO to submit an explanation within 24 hours, following a week of widespread cancellations and delays that have left thousands of passengers stranded across the country.“You are hereby directed to show cause within 24 hours of receipt of this notice as to why appropriate enforcement action should not be initiated against you under the relevant provisions of the Aircraft Rules and Civil Aviation Requirements for the above-mentioned violations,” the notice stated.","Indigo cancels 650 flights on sunday and plans to operate 1,650 of its 2,300 daily flights on december 7.

Goa: 23 Killed In Arpora Nightclub Fire; Cylinder Blast Suspected, CM Sawant Vows Strict Action

NEW DELHI: The fire at a nightclub in Goa, which killed 25 people, started after fireworks were set off inside, chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Sunday.Police had earlier suggested that a cylinder blast caused the blaze, but Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said the preliminary inquiry showed the fire was triggered by electrical firecrackers set off inside the Arpora club.""According to the preliminary inquiry, the fire broke out due to the bursting of some electrical firecrackers inside the club. Some people could come out, but others could not, due to which they lost their lives. A complete inquiry is being done, and a report will be recieved within a week. Suspensions will be issued to some people today itself. The concerned officers will be punished as well,"" Sawant told reporters.Riya, a tourist from Delhi who managed to escape, also told news agency PTI that firecrackers were going off near the stage while dancers were performing.“I think the fire started because of that.

We rushed out of the club only to see that the entire structure was up in flames,"" Fatima Shaikh, a tourist from Hyderabad told PTI.She said some tourists, in the confusion, ran to the kitchen area and got trapped, while ""many managed to run out of the club.""The fire spread rapidly because the club had temporary construction made up of palm leaves, which caught fire instantly.

Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

NEW DELHI: Delhi CM Rekha Gupta on Sunday, reacting to protests over over rising pollution levels, said the government needs at least 27 months to address the crisis.Speaking at an event in Delhi Pitampura, the chief minister said, “Those who make big statements and protest at India Gate… pollution is not something that appeared today, it has been a problem for years. What did the previous government do? Where were you at that time? This is a backlog of 27 years. The government needs at least 27 months to clear the backlog of 27 years.""Her comments came after a series of demonstrations across the city, including one at India Gate where several people were detained during a “clean air protest.” The protesters demanded urgent action and stronger policies to deal with what they called an “air emergency.” Some women brought their children carrying nebulisers and medical prescriptions, using them as symbolic reminders of the growing health impact of Delhi’s smog.Police have detained at least 15 people in connection with the protests. A senior officer said the group refused to disperse and allegedly used pepper spray on personnel, triggering a brief scuffle.Meanwhile, this November has turned out to be one of the most polluted months in recent years for the Delhi–NCR region. All of India’s 10 most polluted cities were located in the area, with Ghaziabad at the top of the list and Delhi ranked fourth. Except for Bahadurgarh in Haryana, none of these cities recorded a single day of clean air, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). The findings also highlighted how pollution in NCR is interconnected, with emissions in one city affecting air quality across the region.Delhi recorded a monthly average PM2.5 concentration of 215 µg/m³ — double the October average of 107 µg/m³. The capital logged 23 ‘very poor’ air days and six ‘severe’ days, underscoring the intensity of the winter smog cycle.",Delhi cm rekha gupta said the government needs at least 27 months to address the crisis.

Mamata Banerjee Warns BJP With Nation-Shaking Threat As SIR Battle Erupts In Bengal Ahead Of Polls

KOLKATA: The pre-hearing phase of Bengal’s SIR of electoral rolls is nearing completion with nearly 100% of 7.6 crore voters’ data having already been digitised. But, between 28 lakh and 30 lakh voters will, in all probability, have to attend poll officials’ hearings if they want to stay on the rolls as they remain unmapped (data not matching with the 2002 roll).All these unmapped voters will get notices to appear for in-person hearings and will have to produce one of the 13 SIR documents that EC has approved for Bengal. The hearings will be held between Dec 16 and Feb 7 next year before the publication of the final electoral rolls on Feb 14. Besides this number, till Saturday afternoon, 54.6 lakh voters remained untraceable or were categorised as dead or duplicate. These names will be deleted from the SIR draft list to be published on Dec 16, officials said. EC’s deadline to complete this phase of SIR ends Thursday.“A little over 7% (54.6 lakh) of the 99.4% digitised enumeration forms are now ‘uncollectible’ and these names will not be included in the draft SIR roll,” a senior EC official said. But voters can challenge and file fresh enrolment applications under Form 6 if they want to challenge this. Around 23.7 lakh voters have died, 19 lakh have shifted, 10.1 lakh are untraceable, and 1.2 lakh are duplicate voters. EC will publish a separate list of voters who have collected forms but are yet to return them to BLOs.

Cabbies double fares; pvt bus operators come to rescue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cabbies-double-fares-pvt-bus-operators-come-to-rescue/articleshow/125798323.cms,"Chandigarh/Nagpur: With major flight disruptions continuing for the third consecutive day, taxi operators in Chandigarh are driving away with the moolah. All IndiGo flights to Delhi were cancelled on Friday due to 'operational issues', prompting many travellers - especially those headed for international connections at IGI Airport - to book last-minute taxis. Several passengers told TOI that they had to fork out nearly twice the normal fare of Rs 5,000-6,000.Those who had time switched to trains, but most had to cough up extra for a cab ride. Arun Kumar and Naina, who were headed to Canada, said they had no option but to book a cab after their flight to Delhi was cancelled. ""We paid Rs 10,000 for a taxi to IGI. Just last week, our friends went for Rs 5,500,"" they said.In Nagpur, abrupt disruptions & repeated cancellations forced hundreds of passengers to turn to private sleeper bus operators, who stepped in to travel to major metros like Mumbai and Bengaluru at short notice. Unlike Chandigarh, however, operators did not hike charges despite the sudden influx, said private bus operator Mukesh Chaurasiya, who runs a fleet of sleeper coaches. ""We charged normal fares. People were genuinely relieved because they had no other option left,"" he said.""Yesterday alone, I provided four to five buses from Nagpur to Mumbai after flights got cancelled. My buses even had to go directly to the airport because so many passengers were stranded, especially after the Bengaluru flight was cancelled,"" Chaurasiya told TOI.""Even today, five to seven buses are coming from Mumbai to Nagpur. We're getting inquiries from Delhi and other cities as well, but our capacity is limited,"" he added.Other private bus operators, too, confirmed a spike in emergency bookings. When TOI checked online fares for Saturday's buses from Nagpur to Mumbai, the AC sleeper seats were less than Rs 3,000. Fares on Nagpur-Bengaluru route showed a hike, but there seemed to be little to no inflation for other destinations like Pune and Hyderabad.","All indigo flights to delhi were cancelled on friday due to 'operational issues' many travellers - especially those headed for international connections at igi airport - had to book last-minute taxis.
