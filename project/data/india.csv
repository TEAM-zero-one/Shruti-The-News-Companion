"Will strengthen INDIA bloc, says Congress",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-strengthen-india-bloc-says-congress/articleshow/125474486.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid the rumblings triggered by the opposition's comprehensive defeat in Bihar, Congress said it was committed to INDIA bloc and would double efforts to strengthen the national alliance.AICC general secretary K C Venugopal said the INDIA bloc was put together as an arrangement at the national level for like-minded parties to coordinate their efforts to counter BJP's regressive politics. ""Nothing has changed since it was formed. Congress is committed to INDIA and will make further efforts to boost its efficacy,"" he told TOI. The Congress manager also said the opposition would continue with its coordination in Parliament when the winter session gets under way on Dec 1.Doubts about the fate of the opposition alliance have surfaced on social media after the decimation suffered by the RJD-Congress combine in the recent Bihar elections , where it was roundly defeated by the JDU-BJP coalition. Some Congress netas too have advocated that in future, the party should move independently in Bihar by junking ally RJD. Some of the questions have also been stoked by the likelihood of Congress contesting the upcoming Bombay Municipal Corporation elections separate from NCP and Shiv Sena (UBT), which are its allies in Maha Vikas Aghadi.Venugopal, however, rubbished the speculations.Many Congress netas said the alliance was intrinsic to the politics of the party, as it would soon be fighting in Tamil Nadu as DMK's junior partner, and would go into the future Assam polls as part of a coalition that is already being stitched.Venugopal said municipal and panchayat elections were local contests, where decisions on alliances were made by local units based on political ground realities, like in BMC. ""But even there, the idea would be to defeat BJP,"" he said. The Kerala MP, who is a confidant of Rahul Gandhi, said while nothing had changed since the national alliance was formed, members were aware there would be differences in a few states, like West Bengal and Kerala. ""We will still fight separately in the two states. But the larger alliance will remain intact,"" he said.","Doubts about the fate of the opposition alliance have surfaced on social media.

He often wore it during his campaign, and waved it at jubilant BJP supporters at the party's headquarters on Nov 14 when he delivered his victory speech after NDA's massive win of 202 seats in the 243-member assembly.The gamcha is now part of mainstream Bihari dressing culture and the state's distinct identity, a change many will welcome. Parag Goswami, a professor at Pearl Academy, said Modi understands semiotics of culture and fashion and has tapped into the rural and working class identity by taking to the gamcha. As a political prop, it is a great identity marker and Modi conveys to the masses in states like Bihar and UP that he shares their culture code and symbols, he said.He noted that Modi had often connected with people in a similar manner, be it wearing the Assamese gamosa or vesti and angavastram, both associated with TN. These carry layers of meaning are valuable in populist identity-making.","Pm narendra modi waved a 'gamcha' to the crowd at the swearing-in ceremony in patna.

"Bihar: Kurmis & Kushwahas power Nitish Kumar's rise, two decades on",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-kurmis-kushwahas-power-nitish-kumars-rise-two-decades-on/articleshow/125474438.cms,"Marking a Political Milestone, Nitish Kumar Sworn In as Bihar CM for the 10th Time

NEW DELHI: The consolidation of Kurmis and Kushwahas - two intermediary backward castes - behind Nitish Kumar powered his rise two decades back, and as he took take oath for an unprecedented 10th time as Bihar CM on Thursday, their share in the assembly also hit a high.NDA's social coalition, which joins two ends of the caste spectrum by bringing together upper castes and Dalits - with the sprawling non-Yadav backward classes and EBCs in between - was the natural beneficiary of the alliance's sweeping mandate, but the two backward castes have made the biggest gains, largely on the back of nearly 100% rise in the seats of Nitish's JDU In the 243-member assembly, Kurmis account for 25 MLAs, while Kushwahas, also known as Koeris in Bihar, have 26 MLAs. Their numbers were 10 and 16 in the outgoing House.The number of extremely backward classes (EBC) MLAs has seen a jump from 29 to 35 and that of upper castes to 72 from 63.The population of Kushwahas is 4.21% and Kurmis 2.87% in Bihar, according to a caste survey by the state govt. Kushwahas are the second-most numerous caste after Yadavs (14.26%), while Kurmis, who score best among all backward castes on development metrics like education and share in govt jobs, have been politically more organised.Nitish, too, hails from the caste.Manindra Nath Thakur, an associate professor at Centre for Political Studies in JNU, said this is a high moment for the two castes. Both trace their origin to Luv-Kush and have exhibited a shared political purpose, he said, noting that they had broken away under Nitish from a broad social alliance Lalu Prasad had formed to counter the domination of upper castes but was perceived to be hegemonised by Yadavs. Due to a fragmented EBC, which is 26% of population, excluding Muslims, and included dozens of castes, Kurmi-Koeri are in a position to lead this social alliance, he noted.Political analyst Sanjay Kumar, however, cautioned against seeing any long-term implication in the rise of the number of Kurmi-Kushwaha MLAs, saying it was election-specific. It is natural because JDU has performed exceptionally well, and the party enjoys a strong support base in these castes, he added.Enthusiastic backing of the governing alliance by Kushwaha voters also show-ed the suggestion that the community was drifting away was incorrect, he added.If NDA's sweep has taken the share of Kurmi-Kushwaha MLAs to a high, the decimation of RJD-led Mahagathbandhan has had an opposite impact on the numbers of representatives from Muslims and Yadavs, who have been its solid supporters. Muslim MLAs are at an all-time low of 11 in the new assembly, while Yadavs' tally has fallen to 28 from 55.","Kurmis account for 25 mlas, while kushwahas, also known as koeris in bihar, have 26 mlas.

NEW DELHI/PATNA: As the swearing-in ceremony ended at Patna's Gandhi Maidan Thursday, CM Nitish Kumar took PM Modi 's hand and lifted it with his to greet a large cheering crowd, marking the new dynamic in their relationship since the JDU president rejoined NDA in Jan 2024.The transformation could not have been starker compared to their headline-grabbing photo-op in 2009 at a NDA rally in Ludhiana, which brought out the JDU chief's unease with the then Gujarat CM.The sight at Gandhi Maidan was a metaphor of the ease in their ties, emphasised in the presence of Modi, Union ministers Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh besides the gamut of chief ministers from BJP and allies.Nitish took oath along with 26 ministers, 14 from BJP, eight from JDU and four from three other allies as NDA looked to accommodate a diverse social coalition in an acknowledgement of its varied support base. They include three women and 10 first-timers, including seven from BJP, with the party rewarding its traditional voting bloc and new additions, while JDU has repeated its old hands, most of whom seen as long trusted aides of Nitish.The sea of saffron and BJP flags were punctuated with the green of JDU and flags of other allies at Gandhi Maidan, with chief ministers from the governing alliance turning up to lend political grandeur to an occasion seen as a high watermark for Nitish Kumar.PM Narendra Modi's gesture of waving gamcha at the end of the ceremony captured the triumphant mood.The PM later lauded the new dispensation as a wonderful team that would take the state to new heights. ""Congratulations to Shri Nitish Kumar Ji on taking oath as Bihar's chief minister. He is an experienced administrator with a proven track record of good governance for many years,"" he said.While JDU's decision to induct only eight of its legislators, none from its core base of Kushwahas, into the government raised a few eyebrows, sources said the party would have more deliberation to fill in its quota when the Nitish cabinet, which can have a maximum strength of 36, is expanded, a neta said.Eight upper castes, six OBCs, seven EBCs, five Dalits and one lone Muslim in JDU MLA Zama Khan make up the new govt. Rajputs, whose share in the new assembly is the highest at 33 MLAs, have the maximum representation followed by two each from Bhumihars, Yadavs, Kurmis, including Nitish, Kushwahas and Nishads.BJP MLAs Samrat Choudhary, an OBC Kushwaha, and Vijay Kumar Sinha, an upper caste Bhumihar, have been retained as deputy CMs.RLM supremo Upendra Kushwaha turned to his son Deepak Prakash, who has little public profile and is not currently a member of either of the two legislators, to be his party's lone representative in govt. Kushwaha's wife Snehlata Kushwaha was elected an MLA in the poll.Santosh Kumar Suman, son of Union minister Jitam Ram Manjhi, will continue to represent HAM(S).BJP rewarded former Union minister Ram Kripal Yadav, a veteran of many difficult electoral battles who vanquished RJD's Ritlal Yadav in Danapur where party supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav held a rare roadshow, by inducting him as a minister.Its new faces include Shreyasi Singh, a former professional shooter, Sanjay Singh Tiger, and Rama Nishad. Nishad is the wife of Ajay Nishad, a former BJP MP who contested and lost on the Congress ticket in the 2024 Lok Sabha election, and her inclusion spotlights the party's efforts to cultivate Nishads, an important swing voting bloc in parts of the state.Old BJP hands like Mangal Pandey, Nitin Nabin and Dilip Jaiswal, who is also the state party president, joined seasoned JDU ministers like Bijendra Yadav, Shrawon Kumar, Vijay Kumar Chaudhary, Leshi Singh and Ashok Choudhary in govt.","Jdu inducts only 8, none from core kushwaha base, raises eyebrows. 26 ministers, 14 from bjp, eight from jdu and four from three other allies.

5-judge bench agrees with 2-judge bench on only one point: Guv can't sit on bill indefinitely,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-judge-bench-agrees-with-2-judge-bench-on-only-one-point-guv-cant-sit-on-bill-indefinitely/articleshow/125474279.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Tamil Nadu govt's 2023 writ petition accusing the governor of deliberately not acting on 10 bills passed by the state assembly had led a two-judge Supreme Court bench to pen a 415-page judgment on April 8, stripping the constitutional heads of states of the minimal discretionary power conferred on them by the Constitution.Alarmed by the strong forays made by the judiciary into the legislative powers of the constitutional heads of the country and states, the President on May 14 sent a 14-question reference in exercise of her powers under Article 143 to seek SC's opinion, virtually on each ruling of the two-judge bench as also whether the ambit of SC's exclusive powers under Article 142 included granting deemed assent to bills.In its 111-page judgment, a bench of CJI B R Gavai, and Justices Surya Kant, Vikran Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar tested the reasoning of the two-judge bench on the constitutional touchstone and found that the directions were beyond the mandate of the Constitution.The only point of convergence of views between the two-judge and the five-judge benches was that the governor could not sit on a bill indefinitely. In such a situation, the five-judge bench said the aggrieved state could move SC. Even then, SC could only ask the governor to act expeditiously and not fix a timeline, it said.The two-judge bench had said, ""There is no expressly specified time-limit for the discharge of the functions by the governor under Article 200 of the Constitution.Despite there being no prescribed time-limit, Article 200 cannot be read in a manner which allows the governor to not act upon bills which are presented to him for assent and thereby delay and essentially roadblock the lawmaking machinery in the state.""Assuring itself that prescribing a timeline for the governor was not akin to amending the Constitution, the two-judge bench had said, ""In case of either withholding of assent or reservation of the bill for the consideration of the President, upon the aid and advice of the state council of ministers, the governor is expected to take such an action forthwith, subject to a maximum period of one month."" It had said the governor must return the bill to the House, if he was withholding assent, within three months or decide within the same timeline reserving it for President's consideration.Turning to the President, the two-judge bench had said, ""There is no 'pocket veto' or 'absolute veto' available to the President in discharge of functions under Article 201. The use of the expression 'shall declare' makes it mandatory for the President to make a choice between the two options available under the substantive part of Article 201, that is, to either grant assent or to withhold assent to a bill.""The two-judge bench fixed a three-month timeline for the President and then granted deemed assent to the 10 Tamil Nadu Bills.In declaring all the above components of the two-judge bench's rulings as impermissible under the Constitutional scheme, the five-judge bench said, ""The governor enjoys discretion in choosing from these three constitutional options and is not bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers, while exercising his function under Article 200. The discharge of the governor's function under Article 200, is not justiciable. The court cannot enter a merits review of the decision so taken.""However, in case of glaring circumstances of inaction that is prolonged, unexplained and indefinite, ""the court can issue a limited mandamus for the governor to discharge his function under Article 200 within a reasonable time, without making any observations on the merits of the exercise of his discretion"".It said, ""The President, too, cannot be bound by judicially prescribed timelines in the discharge of functions under Article 201...the President's assent under Article 201 too, is not justiciable.""Annulling another ruling by the two-judge bench making it virtually mandatory for the President to seek the court's opinion on bills whose constitutionally she doubts, the five-judge bench said, ""In our constitutional scheme, the President is not required to seek advice of this court by way of reference under Article 143, every time a governor reserves a bill for the President's assent.""",The tamil nadu govt's 2023 writ petition accusing the governor of deliberately not acting on 10 bills passed by the state assembly had led a two-judge supreme court bench to pen a 415-page judgment on april 8. The president on may 14 sent a 14-question reference in exercise of her powers under article 143 to seek sc's opinion.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125474328,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-713601,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

The reliance on Article 142, can't lead to supplanting constitutional provisions itself. ""It also faulted the two-judge bench's decision in TN case for prescribing the timeline for the governors and the President and then subjecting their decision to judicial scrutiny on expiry of the timelines when the Constitution clearly prescribes that their decision on Bills are non-justiciable.The five-judge bench said, ""We have no hesitation in concluding that deemed consent of the Governor, or President, under Article 200 or 201 at the expiry of a judicially set timeline, is virtually a takeover, and substitution, of the executive functions by the Judiciary, through judicial pronouncement, which is impermissible within the contours of our written Constitution.""""... We are of the considered opinion that Article 142 cannot be employed to arrive at a conclusion contrary to the express provisions of the Constitution,"" the bench-led by CJI Gavai ruled in its unanimous opinion to the President. ""It is a matter of settled law that jurisdiction under Article 142 cannot be invoked to achieve results that are contrary to the Constitution, or statutory provisions,"" it said.""The concept of 'deemed assent' in the context of Articles 200 and 201 presupposes that one constitutional authority (the SC), could play a 'substitutional role' for another constitutional functionary (the Governor, or President). Such a usurpation of the gubernatorial function of the Governor, and similarly of the President's functions, is antithetical not only to the spirit of the Constitution, but also specifically, the doctrine of separation of powers - which is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution,"" it said, adding that ""A logical corollary of this reasoning is that if there are no prescribed timelines under Articles 200 and 201, then expiry of them too, cannot amount to 'deemed consent'.

Bengaluru Cash Van Robbed Of ₹7 Crore After Fake RBI Officers Trick Staff In A Filmy-Style Heist

8 special teams to probe case

BENGALURU: In one of the well-scripted daring daylight dacoities in Bengaluru, five to six miscreants posing as RBI officials looted Rs 7.1 crore from an armoured cash van from a busy flyover in south Bengaluru on Wednesday afternoon.The incident took place between 12.30pm and 1pm when the van, owned by CMS Info Systems, was moving cash in three boxes from HDFC Bank in JP Nagar to HBR Layout, 22km away. The stunning drama involved an MUV, two hatchbacks and the CMS-run armoured van.Read also: Bengaluru horror: Fake police hold cat at knifepoint, rob woman via UPI The drama started when a hatchback, a Maruti Zen, blocked the cash van near Ashoka Pillar, Jayanagar 2nd Block, around 12.30pm. Besides driver Binod Kumar, there were three occupants in the van: custodian Aftab and gunmen Rajanna & Tammaiah.Three men sprang out of the hatchback, which was tailed by an Innova, an MUV, and directed the van occupants : ""We are RBI officials. There is a complaint against your firm for violating RBI guidelines. We have to record your statements.""The CMS staff readily believed the imposters. The two gunmen Rajanna and Tammaiah left their licensed single-barrel guns in the vehicle and entered the MUV along with the custodian.One of the miscreants advised the cash van driver to go to Dairy Circle flyover — about 3km from Ashoka Pillar — and wait for “the RBI officials”. While Kumar drove ahead, the MUV with the CMS staff and miscreants closely followed the van. On reaching Nimhans junction, the MUV stopped.The miscreants directed the three CMS staffers to disembark: “Come to the police station and we’ll take your statements. Before that, we should take the cash boxes to the RBI.”The CMS staffers walked in the direction of Siddapura police station. Driver Kumar drove up to Dairy Circle flyover and waited there.“Soon, the MUV with miscreants stopped near Kumar. At gunpoint, miscreants shifted the cash boxes into another hatchback — a Maruti WagonR — for inspection by RBI. In the blink of an eye, the miscreants sped away, leaving behind Kumar, his van, and their MUV,” a police officer said.Read more: Bengaluru man slits estranged daughter-in-law’s throat in her sleep over unpaid loan; arrested Bengaluru City police commissioner Seemanth Kumar Singh said they are probing the case from all angles. “Unfortunately, there was a delay in CMS approaching us.

GURGAON: The CEO of a city-based startup has been named in an FIR along with a former employee of Shikhar Dhawan for allegedly cheating the ex-India cricketer and using his photos illegally for endorsement during the Asia Cup earlier this year in Dubai.The case was registered after a complaint was filed by a representative of Dhawan's Da One Group. The complainant accused the duo of misrepresenting themselves as Dhawan's official agents and fraudulently renewing an expired deal with a cricket application for financial gain. The former employee named in the complaint runs a company called Elevate Athletes Creators Ecosystem.According to the complaint, Dhawan, who attended the recently concluded Asia Cup, was stunned to see his photographs and videos prominently displayed across stadium screens, endorsing the app, Crex, when it had no active contract with him at the time. Da One claimed it came to know from Parthtech Developers, which operates the application, that the endorsement had been renewed for a year through an agreement signed on March 10, 2025 with Elevate Athletes.Parthtech, believing the documents presented by the startup founder and Dhawan's employee to be legitimate, paid Rs 40 lakh for the extension — money that, according to the complaint, was pocketed entirely by the duo.According to complaint, Dhawan's original agreement with Parthtech was valid from April 16, 2024 to April 15, 2025, and was signed by the ex-employee during his tenure as CEO of Da One Group. He was authorised to act only within specific limits defined by a board resolution, and his authority ceased both when he left the company in Sept 2024 and when the contract expired in April 2025, according to the complaint.However, it added, the ex-employee continued projecting himself publicly as Dhawan's authorised representative and accused the startup founder and him of producing a forged ""representation agreement"" dated Dec 20, 2024 to falsely claiming to Parthtech that Elevate had been granted exclusive rights to manage Dhawan's endorsements.Da One Group also expressed concern that the duo may still be in possession of forged and fabricated documents to mislead clients and urged police to recover these documents immediately.Based on the complaint, the FIR has been filed under sections 316 (2) (criminal breach of trust), 318 (4) (cheating), 336 (3) (forgery), 338 (forgery of valuable documents like wills), 340 (using forged documents as genuine) and 61 (criminal conspiracy) of BNS.""After receiving the complaint, we have registered the FIR. The individuals concerned will be called to join the investigation and appropriate legal action will be taken against them,"" a senior police officer said.Talking to TOI, the startup founder refuted the allegations. ""Since we all are from the same industry, it cannot happen that we endorsed him without informing him,"" he said.",The case was registered after a complaint was filed by a representative of dhawan's da one group. The complainant accused the duo of misrepresenting themselves as dhawan’s official agents and fraudulently renewing an expired deal with a cricket application for financial gain.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125452272,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-24650,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The State Investigation Agency (SIA) of the J&K Police on Thursday raided the Jammu office of the Kashmir Times, alleging that the publication was involved in activities against the country.Officials said the search led to the recovery of AK rifle cartridges, pistol rounds and hand-grenade pins, among other items.According to officials, SIA teams examined the newspaper’s premises and computer systems after registering a case against the publication and its promoters. The promoters are likely to be questioned as the investigation proceeds, PTI reported.The Kashmir Times management sharply criticised the raids, calling the allegations of anti-state activities ""baseless"" and part of a broader attempt to silence ""independent journalism.""Editors Prabodh Jamwal and Anuradha Bhasin, in a joint statement, said, ""The reported raids on our office in Jammu, the baseless accusations of activities inimical to the state and the coordinated crackdown on the Kashmir Times are yet another attempt to silence us.""""Criticising the government is not the same as being inimical to the state. In fact, it is the very opposite. A robust, questioning press is essential to a healthy democracy.Our work of holding power to account, investigating corruption, amplifying marginalised voices strengthens our nation. It does not weaken it,"" they added.The editors alleged that the organisation was being targeted precisely for its independent reporting. ""In an era when critical voices are increasingly scarce, we remain one of the few independent outlets willing to speak truth to power.""They further urged the authorities to withdraw the charges and end the ""harassment,"" appealing to civil society and media colleagues for support.Calling the allegations an intimidation tactic, they said, ""We call on the authorities to immediately cease this harassment, withdraw these unfounded allegations, and respect the constitutional guarantees of press freedom.""They also highlighted the newspaper’s long legacy since its founding in 1954 by Ved Bhasin, saying ""We have chronicled the region’s triumphs and failures with equal rigour. We have given voice to communities that would otherwise go unheard. We have asked difficult questions when others remained silent.""The editors noted that while the paper’s print edition was suspended in 2021–22 due to ""relentless targeting,"" Kashmir Times continues to operate digitally, with all content accessible on its website.Deputy chief minister Surinder Singh Choudhary, reacting to the raid, said action must be based on evidence and not pressure.""The agencies are doing their work. If a raid has to be conducted, it should not be done on a pick-and-choose basis. If they have done anything wrong, action should be taken, but not just to create pressure,"" Surinder Choudhary told reporters.PDP leader Iltija Mufti, daughter of party chief Mehbooba Mufti, said Kashmir Times had consistently resisted attempts to silence it.""Kashmir Times is one of those rare newspapers in Kashmir that not only spoke truth to power but refused to bend or buckle under pressure and intimidation. Raiding their offices under the guise of carrying out anti-national activities is preposterous and reeks of high-handedness,"" she said.""In Kashmir, every outlet of truth is being choked by invoking the anti-national slur. Are we all anti-nationals?"" she added.","The state investigation agency (sia) of the j&k police on thursday raided the jammu office of the kashmir times.

"Talaak-e-Hasan explained: Why it’s under scrutiny, and how it differs from triple talaq",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/talaak-e-hasan-explained-why-its-under-scrutiny-and-how-it-differs-from-triple-talaq/articleshow/125464201.cms,"Explained: Difference between Talaq-e-Hasan and Triple Talaq

What is Talaak-e-Hasan





Why Talaak-e-Hasan is challenged now





What happened in the 2017 case





How is teen talaq different from Talaak-e-Hasan





Where the debate stands now





NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court, while hearing a petition challenging the unilateral use of Talaq-e-Hasan, on Wednesday questioned the validity of a growing practice in which Muslim men authorise lawyers to issue monthly talaq notices on their behalf. Examining the case of journalist Benazeer Heena, the bench observed that such notices, issued without the husband’s signature, could not be treated as a valid dissolution of marriage. The Court warned that delegating talaq to lawyers or third parties exposes women to serious legal vulnerabilities, including the possibility of being accused of polyandry if they enter another marriage under the mistaken belief that the first marriage has been legally dissolved. The matter, already before the apex court through multiple petitions, has now brought renewed attention to the constitutional and procedural validity of Talaak-e-Hasan.The bench of Chief Justice-designate Surya Kant, along with Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and N K Singh, expressed strong reservations about this emerging practice, reiterating that talaq requires the husband’s direct pronouncement and signature.When senior advocate M R Shamshad, appearing for the husband, argued that such delegation was a customary practice within the community, the bench firmly rejected the claim. Justice Kant asked, “How can this be a valid practice? The notices for talaq and talaqnama must have the signature of the husband. How can a third party give the woman notice on behalf of her husband?” The bench further noted that clients often disown their lawyers’ actions, leaving women legally stranded. “Is this legal? How are such innovations made to give talaq? How is the community promoting such practices? We will not permit such processes to harm the dignity of the Muslim women,” the Court said.Also read - 3 talaqs sent through lawyer not valid: Supreme Court Benazeer, who was present in court, narrated how she had been abandoned by her husband after paying a total alimony of Rs 17,000 and forced to run from “pillar to post”. The Court directed her to file an application specifying the welfare needs of her child, assuring, “We will do the needful.” The bench also praised her courage, stating, “We salute her for gathering courage to move the court challenging the unilateral Talaq-e-Hasan process of divorce. Think of the condition of millions of Muslim women, illiterate and living in rural areas. What would be their plight?”The Court’s remarks indicated that the issue extends beyond individual grievances and affects thousands of Muslim women who may lack awareness, access or legal protection. The bench said it would examine the validity of Talaak-e-Hasan after detailed arguments, a move that has set the stage for a significant judicial review of practices that have long existed within Muslim personal law.Talaak-e-Hasan (TEH) is one of the classical Islamic methods of divorce recognised under Sunni Muslim personal law. Unlike instant triple talaq , which the Supreme Court struck down in 2017, TEH is a staggered process carried out over three months. The husband pronounces “talaq” once every month, typically during a period when the wife is not menstruating, and each pronouncement is intended to be separated by at least one complete menstrual cycle or lunar month. This timing is not arbitrary; it is grounded in Islamic jurisprudence, which emphasises reflection, restraint and opportunities for reconciliation between the spouses.The first pronouncement initiates the process, but the divorce does not become final. During the month that follows, the couple is expected to attempt reconciliation. If they resume cohabitation in any form before the second pronouncement, or if the husband changes his mind, the declaration becomes void. The second pronouncement follows the same pattern. Only if the third pronouncement is made in the third consecutive month, without any resumption of marital relations, does the divorce become final and irrevocable. This structure is closely tied to the Islamic concept of iddat, a mandatory waiting period observed by the wife after divorce or widowhood. The iddat serves several theological and practical functions, including providing time for reflection and clarifying pregnancy status.Within Islamic jurisprudence, TEH is seen as a measured and reversible form of divorce, distinct from the abruptness of instant triple talaq. Nevertheless, critics argue that despite its structured nature, TEH remains a unilateral and extra-judicial mechanism controlled solely by the husband. While Muslim women do have options such as khula—a wife-initiated divorce that requires returning the mehar—or mubarat, where both parties mutually agree to end the marriage, these processes can be inhibited by social pressure, family influence and lack of legal support. As a result, women often remain at a disadvantage when navigating marital dissolution within personal law.The challenge to TEH arises not merely from its theological structure but from how it is being applied today. The Supreme Court’s current examination stems from allegations that husbands are misusing the process by issuing talaq notices through lawyers instead of personally pronouncing the divorce. In the case of Benazeer Heena, her husband allegedly sent three talaq notices through his lawyer, completed a divorce and remarried another woman. Her counsel, senior advocate Rizwan Ahmed, told the Court that “when a talaqnama does not bear the husband’s signature, it is not a valid divorce document.” He cautioned that if a woman remarries under the belief that she is divorced, only to later learn that her husband denies having signed or authorised the talaq, she could be accused of polyandry. He further noted that potential suitors may refuse to marry her out of fear that the earlier divorce may not be legally valid.The bench reacted strongly to this argument. It rejected the claim that delegation of talaq is a widespread or acceptable practice. The judges observed that the integrity of the process collapses when a third party issues notices, especially when the husband can later deny authorising them. They expressed astonishment at the idea that a husband would ask someone else to divorce his wife, asking pointedly, “How can a third party give the woman notice on behalf of her husband?” The bench insisted that talaq must be executed strictly in accordance with religious law and not through intermediaries.The misuse of TEH is not limited to this case. Another petitioner, Nazri Nisha, appeared in person to narrate her difficulties, saying her husband attempted to divorce her through an irregular method. She explained that the lack of a valid divorce document had made it nearly impossible to access essential services such as school admissions and passports for her child. The Supreme Court asked her to file an application so that directions could be issued to protect her rights, emphasising that husbands cannot “enjoy their own life while destroying their wife’s. ”These cases have added to a broader argument that TEH, even when executed in good faith, gives unilateral and disproportionate power to husbands. The petitions challenge this imbalance, arguing that TEH remains discriminatory and violates Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution. They contend that the practice lacks judicial oversight and allows men to dissolve marriages without ensuring financial security, due process or legal validation. The Court’s willingness to examine these claims signals its recognition of the deeper systemic issues at play.The current debate cannot be understood without reference to the Supreme Court’s landmark 2017 judgment in the Shayara Bano case, which struck down instant triple talaq (Talaq-e-biddat) as unconstitutional. The case began when Shayara Bano challenged the talaqnama her husband sent to her in 2015, arguing that triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy violated her fundamental rights. Her petition triggered a nationwide debate on Muslim women’s rights and the nature of personal law.Many women joined the litigation, including Ishrat Jahan, whose husband divorced her over a phone call from Dubai; Gulshan Parween, who received her talaq on a stamp paper; Aafreen Rehman from Jaipur; and Atiya Sabri from Saharanpur. The Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA) also filed a petition, arguing that triple talaq lacked Quranic sanction and violated women’s rights to equality, non-discrimination and dignity.The practice was defended by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) and organisations like the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind. They contended that Muslim personal laws are protected under Article 25 and constitute essential religious practices. They argued that although triple talaq was “bad in theology”, it was “good in law” and valid under the Hanafi school of jurisprudence. They urged the Court to leave any reform to Parliament instead of judicial intervention.In a historic 3:2 verdict, the Supreme Court struck down instant triple talaq as arbitrary and unconstitutional. The Court reasoned that the practice violated Article 14 by granting husbands unilateral power without any possibility of reconciliation. The verdict was followed by the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, which criminalised the pronouncement of instant triple talaq.Significantly, however, the 2017 ruling did not address Talaak-e-Hasan or Talaak-e-Ahsan. These practices were considered more acceptable because they provided time for reflection and potential reconciliation. This omission left unanswered questions that have now resurfaced through petitions filed by women who argue that unilateral talaq—whether instant or staggered—remains discriminatory in practice.Teen talaq, or Talaq-e-biddat, is fundamentally different from Talaak-e-Hasan both in process and principle. Teen talaq involves the husband pronouncing “talaq” three times in one sitting, leading to the immediate termination of marriage. It does not require a waiting period, the wife’s presence or acknowledgement, or any attempt at reconciliation. Historically, the practice became infamous for being delivered through letters, phone calls, text messages and even social media. This instant, irrevocable nature was the chief reason it was struck down as unconstitutional.Talaak-e-Hasan, by contrast, is a three-step process over three months. Each pronouncement is separated by a significant interval, creating space for reflection and reconciliation. The first and second pronouncements are revocable, meaning the marriage continues if the couple resumes cohabitation. Only after the third pronouncement does the divorce become final. Scholars argue that TEH aligns with Quranic principles, which discourage hasty dissolution of marriage and emphasise attempts to reconcile.Also read - Explained: Why did SC say 'Talaq-e-Hasan' is different from triple talaq The Supreme Court itself has recognised this distinction. In a 2022 hearing on a related petition, the Court observed, “This is not triple talaq. You (women) also have option of Khula.” The Court noted that women have alternative routes such as khula, separation by mutual consent through mubarat and judicial remedies, whereas teen talaq offered no such opportunities for women.Yet, critics point out that despite these theoretical safeguards, TEH remains unilateral and extra-judicial. They argue that waiting periods or reconciliation windows do not compensate for the fact that the husband alone controls the process. The petitions before the Court contend that even staggered unilateral divorce violates the principles of equality and dignity enshrined in the Constitution.The Supreme Court’s latest observations do not equate TEH with instant triple talaq. The bench made it clear that TEH is not “so improper” as to be immediately struck down. However, the judges also signalled that procedural misuse, especially through delegated notices, cannot be tolerated. They emphasised that any valid divorce must comply strictly with Sharia procedures and must not compromise the dignity and security of women.The Court will now examine TEH in detail on 26 November, when it hears a batch of petitions challenging unilateral talaq practices. The issues before the Court include whether TEH is constitutionally valid, whether unilateral extra-judicial divorce violates women’s fundamental rights, and whether Parliament or the judiciary should reform personal laws that affect millions of Indian Muslim families.Whatever the eventual decision, the case marks an important moment in India’s evolving dialogue on personal laws, gender justice and constitutional morality. The Court’s findings will likely shape the future of marital rights for Muslim women and further clarify the balance between religious freedom and the right to equality.",The supreme court questioned the validity of a growing practice in which muslim men authorise lawyers to issue monthly talaq notices on their behalf. The court warned that delegating talaq to lawyers exposes women to serious legal vulnerabilities.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125464721,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1242631,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Calm And Radical: Dr Umar’s Pre-Blast Video Exposes Educated New Face Of Terror Behind Delhi Attack

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Thursday remanded four accused in the Red Fort blast case to 10 days of NIA custody. The agency identified them as Dr Muzammil Shakeel Ganai of Pulwama, Dr Adeel Ahmed Rather, a Saharanpur-based practitioner originally from Anantnag, Dr Shaheen Saeed of Lucknow, and Mufti Irfan Ahmad Wagay of Shopian. All four were taken into custody in Srinagar on production warrants issued by the Patiala House Court.According to the central counter-terror agency, Saeed, Rather and the two others “played a major role” in planning and executing the November 10 Delhi blast , which killed several civilians and left many injured.Investigators said the four suspects were involved in logistics, planning and on-ground facilitation of the terror plot. Until now, they had been in the custody of the Jammu & Kashmir Police.Also read: Red Fort gears up for first mega event; security stepped up as President Murmu & Shah likely to attend These arrests come after two earlier detentions by the NIA, Amir Rashid Ali, in whose name the vehicle used in the blast was registered, and Jasir Bilal Wani, alias Danish, who allegedly provided crucial technical support to the module. Both are currently under interrogation.The November 10 explosion near the Red Fort metro station has so far claimed 15 lives.Last week, the Union Cabinet formally classified the incident as a “heinous terror attack” and vowed that those responsible would face “the strictest possible punishment.”According to the NIA, investigators have examined 73 witnesses, including injured survivors. The agency is coordinating with Delhi Police, Jammu & Kashmir Police, Haryana Police, Uttar Pradesh Police, and other agencies to trace the broader conspiracy and dismantle the network behind the attack.The investigation has now expanded to include Saudi Arabia , the Maldives and Turkey, along with multiple states across India.","A delhi court on thursday remanded four accused in the red fort blast case to 10 days of nia custody.

Bihar Assembly Poll Results: NDA Touches 200-Seat Lead, Congress Intensifies SIR, Vote Chori Attacks

NEW DELHI: Describing the ongoing Special Intensive Revision in West Bengal as “unplanned, chaotic, and dangerous,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Thursday that the situation had reached an “alarming stage” following the deaths of multiple booth-level officers (BLOs), including an anganwadi worker in Jalpaiguri.In a letter addressed to CEC Gyanesh Kumar, Banerjee said she had “time and again flagged my serious concerns” but had now been “compelled to write” as the situation had deteriorated sharply.She wrote that the manner in which the EC had pushed the SIR onto officials and residents was “not only unplanned and chaotic, but also dangerous”, alleging the absence of basic preparedness, clear communication, or adequate planning.According to her, the process has been “crippled from day one” by poor training, confusion over mandatory documentation, and the near impossibility of meeting voters during their work hours.She warned that the credibility of the voter roll itself was at risk, saying BLOs were being forced to work “far beyond human limits” while balancing their principal duties as teachers and frontline workers.Banerjee said most BLOs were struggling with online submissions because of server failures and repeated data mismatches, making it “almost certain” that accurate voter data could not be uploaded by the 4 December deadline.She added that many BLOs, under fear of punitive action, were being pushed to submit incorrect entries, “risking disenfranchisement of genuine voters”.Mamata's letter came after, Shanti Muni Ekka, had repeatedly asked to be relieved from duties but was denied, her family said. Her inability to read or write Bengali and the need to visit tea garden workers late at night had left her “mentally devastated”, according to her son. Another BLO died earlier this month after a stroke allegedly linked to pressure to meet distribution targets.Earlier, on Wednesday the West Bengal CM had condemned what she describes as the “inhuman” pressure placed on field workers, following the death of a BLO in Jalpaiguri.She claimed 28 personnel have died since the SIR began and urged the ECI to suspend the drive, though opposition parties have dismissed her allegations.The national revision exercise, now in its second phase, has seen more than 50 crore enumeration forms distributed across 12 states and Union territories.The Election Commission of India (ECI) has urged the Nadia administration in West Bengal to complete digitising records from the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls by 26 November, as the state advances its preparations for forthcoming elections. According to officials, West Bengal has 7.66 crore electors, with 99.72 per cent of Enumeration Forms already distributed and digitisation completed for 1.48 crore forms.","West bengal chief minister mamata banerjee has described the ongoing special intensive revision as “unplanned, chaotic, and dangerous” she said the situation had reached an “alarming stage” following the deaths of multiple booth-level officers (blos), including an anganwadi worker.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125460864,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-943610,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Though a push from women supporters on account of incentives, including a Rs 10,000 transfer in their bank accounts, was a big factor in NDA's landslide win in Bihar, the alliance wasn't the only beneficiary of high participation in the polls by women. AIMIM walked away with three of the five seats with the highest women voter turnout - namely Kochadhaman, Baisi and Amour - indicating that the correlation between women turnout and electoral outcome was not always straight. AIMIM's total tally was 5 seats. JDU, meanwhile, won in Thakurganj assembly constituency (AC) where 90% of the women turned up, while BJP was the victor in Pranpur, which saw 89% women turnout.The special intensive revision (SIR) exercise in Bihar, conducted amid resistance from the opposition led by Congress, saw NDA parties winning four of the five seats that accounted for the maximum as well as minimum deletions of electors in SIR. Significantly, Congress, with an overall tally of six seats, won Kishanganj despite the AC having recorded the fifth highest deletion among the state's 243 ACs, as well as Chanpatia, which saw second lowest deletion.As per Bihar poll datasets released by EC on Wednesday, BJP won three of the five seats with the highest net deletions - Gopalganj, Purnia and Motihari - followed by JDU, which won Kuchaikote. As regards the five ACs with the least net deletions, BJP and LJPRV won from two each. The datasets linking SIR and poll outcome, thus, do not fit into a pattern. Even so, the four seats (of total five) with the maximum and minimum deletions bagged by NDA are proportional to its overall 83% share in Bihar's 243 seats. Four of the five ACs with the maximum additions made to the Bihar electoral roll between Sept 30 and Oct 20 (the last date of nomination for Phase 2) are now represented by NDA parties, with BJP having its candidates elected from Nautan and Tarari, JDU from Thakurganj, Congress from Araria, and LJPRV from Chenari. The seats that saw the least number of additions to the roll in this period are now represented by JDU, BJP and LJPRV. Among the five seats with the highest winning margin, JDU won in Rupauli and Gopalpur, BJP in Digha and Aurai, and LJPRV in Sugauli. The list of top five ACs with the lowest victory margin includes Sandesh and Nabinagar won by JDU, Ramgarh won by BSP, Agiaon by BJP and Dhaka won by RJD.Congress won from Manihari (ST), the last among the five ACs that clocked the highest male polling percentage. BJP won two of the seats with the highest male voter turnout and three with the lowest male turnout. JDU and LJPRV each bagged one of the five seats with the highest and lowest male polling percentage.Kasba, which recorded the highest total polling percentage at 81.9%, ended up in LJPRV's kitty, Barari and Thakurganj ACs went the JDU way with 81.7% and 81.6% polling, respectively, while Congress bagged Kishanganj with the fifth highest overall turnout of 80.2%. BJP won four of the five seats with the lowest polling percentage - namely Kumhrar, Bankipur, Digha (all in Patna) and Biharsharif - even as JDU bagged Nawada.","Aimim walked away with three of the five seats with the highest women voter turnout.

Can Any President Make The PM Resign? Owaisi Blasts BJP's Morality, Questions Corrupt Neta Bill

How the presidential reference reached the Supreme Court

Key takeaways

1. Courts cannot impose fixed timelines on governors or the president.

""The imposition of timelines is strictly contrary to the elasticity that Constitution has preserved...""

2.

C

ourts cannot substitute themselves for the Governor or President in granting assent to Bills.

""The concept of Deemed assent in the context of Articles 200 and 201 presupposes that one Constitutional authority, namely court, could play a substitutional role for another Constitutional functionary authority - the governor or president.""

3

Taking over the decision-making role of governors or the president violates the separation of powers.

""Such usurpation of gubernatorial powers of governor or president is antithetical to the spirit of the constitution and the doctrine of separation of powers.""

4. Granting deemed assent effectively removes the constitutional role of another authority, which is not permissible.

""The concept of deemed assent of pending bills amounts to virtually takeaway of role of another Constitutional authority.""

5. Courts cannot automatically intervene in every situation; intervention must be case-specific.

""Not everything will lead courts to issue automatic directions to act and it has to be measured based on appropriate circumstances...""

6

Courts can issue limited directions to ensure constitutional accountability, but only when justified.

""...and this courts can issue limited directions in terms of constitutional accountability.""

Governors can’t sit on Bills indefinitely

return a Bill with a message to the Assembly for reconsideration, or

reserve the Bill for the president’s consideration.

No judicial timelines — and no ‘deemed assent’

Discretion preserved, but subject to constitutional discipline

President cannot be told to seek SC’s opinion

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday held that Governors cannot indefinitely sit on Bills passed by state legislatures, stressing that India’s cooperative federalism demands dialogue with elected Houses rather than obstruction.At the same time, the Constitution Bench made it clear that constitutional courts cannot prescribe hard timelines for governors or the president to act on Bills, nor can they invent a doctrine of “deemed assent” or compel the president to seek the court’s opinion on such legislation.The five-judge Bench, led by chief justice B R Gavai and comprising justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar, delivered its opinion on a presidential reference that questioned whether courts could fix deadlines for constitutional authorities to grant or withhold assent to Bills under Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution.In May, president Droupadi Murmu invoked Article 143(1) of the Constitution to seek the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on a sensitive question: could constitutional courts, through judicial orders, impose timelines on the president when dealing with Bills forwarded by state Assemblies, and on governors when handling Bills under Article 200?Her decision followed an April 8 verdict in a case from Tamil Nadu, where a two-judge Bench had framed detailed guidelines on how quickly governors and the president must decide on Bills, and in an unprecedented move, used Article 142 to treat 10 Tamil Nadu Bills as having received “deemed assent” after prolonged inaction by the Governor.In a five-page reference, the president placed 14 questions before the court, seeking clarity on the nature and limits of the powers exercised by governors and the president under Articles 200 and 201, and whether judicial timelines or “deemed assent” were constitutionally permissible.Answering the reference, the Constitution Bench underlined that governors are not free to use silence as a veto. It held that in a system of cooperative federalism, a governor cannot indefinitely withhold assent to Bills duly passed by the state legislature.The court said that when doubts arise over a Bill, the Governor must adopt a process of institutional dialogue by sending the Bill back with comments or seeking clarifications rather than acting as an obstacle to the elected government. The message was that Raj Bhavans cannot become sites of “pocket veto” politics, where legislation is stalled simply by inaction.Reiterating the scheme of Articles 200 and 201, the Bench said a governor has the constitutional discretion either to:“This discretion of the Governor cannot be whittled down,” the Bench led by CJI B R Gavai observed, even as it insisted that this discretion has to be exercised in a manner consistent with constitutional morality and the federal balance.On the core issue raised by the president, the Supreme Court bluntly held that constitutional courts cannot prescribe mandatory timelines for the president or governors to take decisions on Bills. Any such fixed schedule, the Bench said, would amount to rewriting the Constitution, which consciously left these timelines open, subject to the overarching test of reasonableness and judicial review.It declared that the direction issued earlier by a two-judge Bench in the Tamil Nadu case, which had set out specific periods within which governors and the president must act on Bills, was unconstitutional. Judicial creativity, the court cautioned, cannot cross over into constitutional amendment.Going further, the Constitution Bench rejected the idea that courts can grant “deemed assent” to Bills pending before a governor. It held that using Article 142 to treat Bills as automatically assented to, merely because a governor delayed a decision, was outside the judiciary’s remit and violated the separation of powers.The five-judge Bench said the Supreme Court cannot unconstitutionally take over the powers of governors and the president in the name of doing justice. Articles 200 and 201, it emphasised, lay down a specific constitutional route for dealing with Bills, and courts cannot create a parallel mechanism that bypasses elected institutions and constitutional authorities.While firmly shutting the door on judicially crafted timelines and deemed assent, the court also declined to strip governors or the president of their constitutional discretion.The Bench reiterated that a Governor’s options under Article 200 — assent, withholding assent, returning the Bill with a message, or reserving it for the president are part of the constitutional design and “cannot be whittled down”. However, this does not mean that a governor can weaponise discretion to frustrate an elected government’s legislative agenda.The judgment leaves space for constitutional courts to examine cases of egregious delay or mala fide conduct by governors or the president, and to issue directions for a decision to be taken, but it stops short of allowing the judiciary to write hard deadlines or to substitute its own decision for that of constitutional authorities. In other words, courts can prod, but they cannot step into the shoes of the Raj Bhavan or Rashtrapati Bhavan.The Constitution Bench also disagreed with a two-judge Bench’s earlier view that the president should seek the Supreme Court’s opinion on the constitutionality of a Bill reserved for her consideration by the governor.It held that while Article 143 empowers the president to refer questions of law or fact of public importance to the Supreme Court, the initiative to seek such an opinion rests solely with the president. The court cannot direct the president to make a reference, nor can it insist that every controversial or potentially unconstitutional Bill reserved under Article 201 be routed through an advisory opinion.By answering the presidential reference in this manner, the Supreme Court has attempted to walk a narrow line: reaffirming that governors are bound by the spirit of cooperative federalism and cannot paralyse state legislation through indefinite delay, while also warning that judges cannot re-write the constitutional script by fixing rigid timelines, inventing “deemed assent” or commandeering the advisory powers of the president.","Supreme court: courts cannot impose fixed timelines on governors or the president. Courts can issue limited directions to ensure constitutional accountability, but only when justified. Granting deemed assent effectively removes the constitutional role of another authority, which is not permissible.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125458757,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-41192,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Calm And Radical: Dr Umar’s Pre-Blast Video Exposes Educated New Face Of Terror Behind Delhi Attack

NEW DELHI: Authorities in Jammu and Kashmir intensified searches across hospitals and media offices on Thursday as part of the widening investigation into the Delhi blast, with police focusing on possible links between medical staff, extremist modules, and networks connected to fugitive operatives.The scrutiny, officials told PTI, stems from the recovery of arms, ammunition and nearly 3,000 kg of explosive material in the “white-collar” terror module that first came to light in south Kashmir earlier this month.In Srinagar and Anantnag, police teams, accompanied by medical officers, inspected lockers used by doctors and other hospital staff in district hospitals, private facilities, medical colleges and health centres.Officers said the drive was aimed at preventing misuse of storage spaces for illegal or hazardous material and ensuring that hospital infrastructure was not being exploited for activities that could compromise security. Every rack and locker was examined, and staff were reminded that lockers must be used strictly for official purposes.Officials said these checks will now be part of routine vigilance across health institutions.The operation followed the discovery of an AK-47 rifle in the locker of Dr Adeel Rather at the Government Medical College in Anantnag earlier this month. His arrest led to the unravelling of a larger terror network involving several doctors. During Thursday’s inspection at GMC Anantnag, police and hospital administrators identified unclaimed lockers and directed that records be updated to prevent further misuse.Parallel to the hospital searches, the State Investigation Agency raided the Jammu head office of Kashmir Times and the residence of owner Prabodh Jamwal. The agency said arms, ammunition and incriminating documents were seized during the raids. According to investigators, the publication is accused of promoting anti-national activities and running content that allegedly propagated secessionist narratives. Items recovered during the search included a revolver, empty AK-series cases, live rounds, fired bullets, grenade safety levers and suspected pistol ammunition. These will undergo forensic and technical analysis as part of the ongoing inquiry.Meanwhile, the Delhi Police Special Cell identified a new link in the Red Fort car blast investigation, connecting the case to fugitive Indian Mujahideen operative Mirza Shadab Baig. Baig, wanted for the 2008 blasts in Rajasthan and Gujarat, studied at Al-Falah—an institution already under scrutiny after the “suicide bomber” involved in the Delhi attack was found to be a professor there. Multiple agencies are now examining networks tied to the university, which is facing separate cases for alleged financial irregularities and forgery, alongside searches by the Enforcement Directorate earlier this week.","Authorities intensify searches across hospitals and media offices in jammu and kashmir.

'One Wrong Can't Justify...': Bangladesh Expert On Elections After Sheikh Hasina Death Penalty

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Mahua Moitra on Wednesday courted controversy when she shared an old photo of the arrest of Bangladesh’s former poll commissioner in an election-manipulation case, saying it was a sign of ""things to come” in an apparent reference to the INDIA bloc’s allegation that the Election Commission of India (ECI) chief is ""colluding with the ruling BJP to rig elections"".Moitra, who is also the Lok Sabha MP, drew sharp retort from the BJP, which slammed her for speaking ""like an enemy of the country"".Lashing out at Mohua Moitra, BJP's national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said: “Mahua Moitra is a Member of Parliament of India, but she speaks like an enemy of the country. The kind of tweet she has posted now— is she trying to say that India’s democracy is like that of Bangladesh?""""Earlier too, we saw RJD leaders saying that if they lose the election, they will turn the country into Bangladesh or Nepal, creating such a situation. We have also seen Rahul Gandhi say that their fight is against the Indian State,” he told news agency ANI.Even Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attacked the ECI-led Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise during a meeting with AICC office-bearers from 12 states and Union Territories where the electoral roll revision is under way.He told party leaders that the Congress must counter the drive “politically, organisationally and legally,” according to sources quoted by PTI.Rahul, the sources said, argued that while the Election Commission is responsible for maintaining accurate voter rolls, it appeared to be shifting the burden onto political parties.He also questioned how the SIR was being implemented, warning that it “could lead to the removal of legitimate voters.”Several other Congress leaders echoed his fears, reviving their familiar “vote-chori” charge or calling the SIR a “sinister attempt to destroy Democracy”.Even as the opposition ramps up its resistance, the Election Commission reported that it has already distributed 50.25 crore enumeration forms across the 12 states and UTs, covering 98.54 per cent of the 50.97 crore eligible voters. The first phase spans Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Puducherry, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and Lakshadweep.Four of these, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala and West Bengal, head to the polls in 2026. Assam, also set for elections in 2026, received approval for a “special revision” of rolls on Monday.The second phase of SIR began on November 4 and will run until December 4.Rahul, meanwhile, has continued questioning the recent electoral outcomes. Last week, he termed the Bihar results “surprising” and cast doubt on the fairness of the process, saying the Congress and the INDIA bloc would scrutinise the outcome in detail. The party later alleged that the verdict reflected “vote chori on a gigantic scale, masterminded by the prime minister, the home minister, the EC”.","Mahua moitra shared an old photo of the arrest of bangladesh’s former poll commissioner in an election-manipulation case.

Security tightened across Red Fort zone



Public advisories issued



NEW DELHI: Just weeks after the November 10 car blast near the Red Fort, the historic monument is preparing to host a major event marking the 350th death anniversary of Guru Tegh Bahadur, officials said on Thursday.The security has been stepped up significantly ahead of the three-day kirtan darbar, which will run from November 23 to 25 and is expected to draw nearly 50,000 people, the officials added.Jasmain Singh Noni, secretary of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC), said that President Droupadi Murmu and Union home minister Amit Shah are likely to attend the event, PTI reported.The Delhi Police has put in place a multi-layer security grid involving CISF, Delhi Police, bomb squads and other agencies.Around 25 additional CCTV cameras have been installed on routes leading to the Red Fort, while the DSGMC has set up 250–300 cameras for round-the-clock monitoring.These measures came after the Delhi car explosion triggered by a ""suicide bomber,"" which came after the busting of a ""white-collar terror module"" operating across Jammu & Kashmir, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, that claimed 15 lives.Even as the scars of the blast remain, the DSGMC officials said preparations for the commemorative event never stopped.""Even when the incident happened, the work did not halt for a minute because this is for our Guru. Delhi Police assured us of maximum security. We have installed 250 to 300 CCTV cameras around the Red Fort to maintain vigil,"" he added.He further said that while some people were initially hesitant to travel to Delhi after the explosion, the organisers reassured them. Now, attendance is expected to exceed 50,000.Despite the recent blast, many visitors said they were not afraid to attend the commemorations. ""We are courageous and God-fearing people. These blasts cannot shake our faith in God. When our Guru was not scared, who are we to fear anyone?"" 71-year-old Paramjeet Singh Chadha, who visited the Red Fort on Wednesday told PTI.Meanwhile, police personnel have been making announcements in the Chandni Chowk area, urging people to stay alert, verify tenants, record auto-rickshaw numbers and avoid taking food from strangers.With enhanced surveillance and heavy deployment, officials say the Red Fort is ready to host the high-profile religious gathering despite the recent security scare.","The three-day kirtan darbar will run from november 23 to 25 and is expected to draw nearly 50,000 people.
