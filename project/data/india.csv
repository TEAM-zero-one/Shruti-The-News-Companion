The Aam Aadmi Party 's former members—including founding members who gradually left the party in the years following its formation—are now reacting to its historic defeat, blaming the shift in the party's original values for the downfall.What's common in their criticism is the party’s shift from the original promise of alternative politics letting down those who supported the 2011 anti-corruption movement against the then Congress-led government. Anna Hazare , regarded as the father of the anti-graft movement and the leader in whose shadow Kejriwal emerged, distanced himself from the Aam Aadmi Party as soon as it was established, citing differences in values.Hazare, while speaking to reporters in his village of Ralegan Siddhi, said that the liquor policy and the resulting influx of money had overwhelmed the party.""People saw him (Arvind Kejriwal) talking about a clean character and then about liquor,"" he told reporters in Ralegan Siddhi.Hazare further said that AAP had failed to understand the need for selfless service and had taken the wrong path. ""Money took centre stage, denting AAP's image and leading to its defeat,"" he added.""I have been saying this since the beginning: when one contests elections, the candidate's character should be clean and spotless. The candidate should understand the virtues of sacrifice and have the capacity to tolerate insults,"" he said, adding that when allegations arise, it is necessary to assure the people that these charges are unfounded. Yogendra Yadav , co-founder of the Swaraj India party and former AAP member—who was expelled in 2015 along with Prashant Bhushan—described the party’s loss as a major setback for everyone who once believed in alternative politics. He further said that AAP abandoned its core ideology soon after coming to power and instead focused solely on welfare schemes, which eventually reached a saturation point with the voters.Poet-politician Kumar Vishwas , who was actively involved in the India Against Corruption movement and one of AAP’s founding members, accused Kejriwal of “destroying” the aspirations of thousands who longed for a corruption-free country.""It is sad because 13 years ago, a wave of political renaissance swept across India, planting the seeds of alternative politics."" In a strong rebuke, he described Kejriwal as ""a shameless, narcissistic, insecure person"" who played the part of Duryodhan, leading to the downfall.""This is their first defeat. For the crime of murdering the dreams of crores of innocent people, they will be punished,"" he warned while urging AAP workers to consider their future as there appears to be little chance of the party recovering.Former Delhi Commission for Women chief and Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal , who left AAP last year after an incident at Kejriwal’s residence, remarked that the party was punished by the people for its arrogance.""Nobody’s arrogance lasts forever. What happened in Delhi today is proof,"" Maliwal told PTI.She further said that Delhi had turned into a ""garbage bin"" with issues such as water scarcity, a polluted Yamuna, and high levels of air pollution, which had led to widespread public anger.""Over the last 10 years, they showed people dreams but could not fulfill them. They got me beaten up and slandered; today people taught him a lesson, and he could not save his own seat,"" she added.Shazia Ilmi, another founding member who left AAP in 2014 for the BJP, recalled that those who had gathered at the Ramlila ground for the anti-corruption movement had envisioned a new form of politics.""I am absolutely delighted and also emotional. All of us who gathered at the Ramlila ground wanted a new kind of politics. But what did Delhi get? It got a charlatan who brought the city down,"" she said.Criticising Kejriwal further, she said, ""This is a man who caused a loss of Rs 260 crore to the exchequer, lived in 'Sheesh Mahal', and turned AAP into a disaster. Finally, Delhi will see some peace, work, and development.""The 2025 Delhi assembly elections saw a significant shift in voter preferences, leading to a historic victory for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and ending their 27-year exile from power. The BJP improved its vote share by 7.3 percentage points to secure 45.8 percent of votes, while the AAP saw its share dip by nearly 10 percentage points to 43.8 percent.",Anna hazare said that the liquor policy and the resulting influx of money had overwhelmed the party. Kumar vishwas accused kejriwal of “destroying” the aspirations of thousands who longed for a corruption-free country. Former delhi commission for women chief and rajya sabha mp swati maliwal remarked that the party was punished by the people for its arrogance.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118071235,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-60530,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Delhi poll results deepen INDIA bloc rift as Congress blamed for AAP’s defeat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-poll-results-deepen-india-bloc-rift-as-congress-blamed-for-aaps-defeat/articleshow/118071320.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi poll results are likely to reignite the debate within the opposition INDIA bloc of parties over its leadership, with Congress, the largest party and the hence the de facto leader in the bloc having played a perfect spoiler in AAP’s defeat to the BJP, which returned to office in Delhi after 27 long years.While parties like SP, RJD and Shiv Sena (UBT) had backed Trinamool Congress chief and West Bengal Mamata Banerjee to lead the bloc, DMK and NCP(SP) have not come out in support of the idea, so far.The rumblings on this line had surfaced after the Congress’s defeat in Haryana and in Maharashtra where it was in alliance with NCP (SP) and Sena (UBT). The Left parties, strongly opponents of the ruling TMC in Bengal, are unlikely to accept Banerjee’s leadership in the bloc.Whether the leadership comes at this juncture in the INDIA bloc right now or not Congress will certainly face the heat, from the INDIA allies as many accuse it of failing to take along all partners and conduct the opposition camp in a focussed direction. TMC, has been among the first ones to highlight this issue openly, since the 2024 Lok Sabha polls .With the Budget session of Parliament in session, it is to be seen whether the disruption within the INDIA bloc spills out in the House, since a joint strategy on the floor of the House has been more or less effective against the Narendra Modi-led government.Whether the defeat compels AAP to remain with the INDIA bloc or pushes it out for not getting along with Congress is also to be seen. INDIA bloc parties like SP and TMC though not having stakes in Delhi, had thrown their weight behind AAP on the grounds that it was in the best position to take on BJP.Expressing his concern over AAP’s loss, CPI general secretary D Raja said in a post on ‘X’: “BJP’s victory… serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of disunity among secular-democratic forces. This result clearly highlights that the RSS-BJP’s divisive agenda can only be effectively countered through a united, ideological and political front.” Raja added, “It is a wake-up call for the constituents of the INDIA bloc, particularly Congress—the largest party in the coalition—and other dominant regional parties.”Expressing strong disappointment, CPM and the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) said the differences in the INDIA bloc paved the way for the saffron party's good show in the national capital. The Marxist party vehemently attacked Congress and accused them of facilitating the victory of the BJP in Delhi.",The delhi poll results are likely to reignite the debate within the opposition india bloc of parties over its leadership. The rumblings on this line had surfaced after the congress’s defeat in haryana and in maharashtra where it was in alliance with ncp (sp) and sena (ubt),"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118071400,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1677588,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Delhi polls 2025: How good governance trumped freebies in assembly elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-polls-2025-how-good-governance-trumped-freebies-in-assembly-elections/articleshow/118070246.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi on Saturday joined a growing list of states where the lotus has managed to bloom with a vengeance. The Bharatiya Janata Party, which was struggling to even get double-digits in seat share in the past two assembly polls, won the election by securing a whopping 48 of 70 seats. Breaking the 27-year jinx, the BJP is again coming back to form the government in the national capital with the promise of development and good governance.The Aam Aadmi Party's defeat this time around has shown that freebie politics cannot hold its sheen for long if not coupled with on-the-ground development and infrastructure improvement.In this year's assembly election, BJP and Congress both followed the AAP's manifestos giving free electricity, water and bus services for women and even financial aid. This seemed like a freebies vs freebies contest where the BJP's advantage stemmed from two factors: voters' assessment of implementation records, with the BJP's performance in Madhya Pradesh outweighing AAP's shortcomings in Punjab; and the understanding that welfare schemes must be complemented by good governance.Reiterating the BJP's strategy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the party's historic win in Delhi, stating that ""development and good governance"" had won.""Jana Shakti is paramount! Development wins, good governance triumphs. I bow to my dear sisters and brothers of Delhi for this resounding and historic mandate to @BJP4India. We are humbled and honoured to receive these blessings. It is our guarantee that we will leave no stone unturned in developing Delhi, improving the overall quality of life for the people and ensuring that Delhi has a prime role to play in building a Viksit Bharat,"" he said in a tweet.Freebies, though a good strategy in the short term, failed to get votes for AAP this time. There was a lack of infrastructural development that raised questions among voters regarding AAP and its effectiveness in governance. In Delhi, AAP had promised to give clean tap water but there were many areas where the people didn't even have access to tap water. Long queues behind water tankers were a common sight across the city.For this year's elections, Kejriwal also promised to give financial support to priests, sparking a debate over whether the party's ideology revovled merely around ""revdi"" politics.In the last two elections, the AAP's main strong point was Mohalla clinics and municipal schools but one cannot fight only on the basis of these two pillars. Delhiites were looking for more evidence of developmental works that AAP had done in the last decade, and the party came up short.Another factor that lent itself to AAP's defeat was its frequent run-ins with the Lt Governor's office. Considering Delhi's governance structure under the National Capital Territory Act, the constant bickering created an impression of administrative inefficiency by AAP.Kejriwal's decision to retain his CM position whilst in custody over the excise policy scam case appeared to convince voters that administrative efficiency was being compromised for political advantage.This also resulted in postponed Cabinet sessions and administrative standstill. Saturday's results suggest that stepping down in March 2024 and maintaining ethical standards would have been a more prudent political strategy.",The bharatiya janata party won the election by securing a whopping 48 of 70 seats. The bjp is again coming back to form the government in the national capital. The aam aadmi party's defeat this time around has shown that freebie politics cannot hold its sheen for long.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118071239,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1079282,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
'Stability in zero': Amit Shah's jab at Congress' poor show in Delhi elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stability-in-zero-amit-shahs-jab-at-congress-poor-show-in-delhi-elections/articleshow/118071206.cms,"NEW DELHI: Union minister Amit Shah on Saturday mocked Congress for yet another poor performance in the Delhi assembly elections and accused the party of prioritising the Gandhi family over fighting elections.In a social media post on X, Shah took a potshot at the grand-old-party and said that it’s security deposit was forfeited in 67 out of 70 assembly seats.""Congress is the biggest example of what happens to a party becomes focused on family devotion. In Delhi, where Congress ruled for 15 years a decade ago, it has not won a single seat in the 6 elections held since 2014,"" Shah said.""In this assembly election, Congress’s security deposit was forfeited in 67 out of 70 seats. If there is any stability found for Congress under Rahul Gandhi ’s leadership, it is found in zero (0). This reflects the situation of Congress, which is dedicated to serving one family, across the country,"" he added.Shah's reactions came hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi attacked Congress, saying the country needs a serious political transformation and not politics of ""dhoort-ta (deceit) and moorkhta (foolishness)"".He said people of Delhi have short-circuited the politics of short-cuts and asserted that the mandate has made it clear that there's no space for corruption and lies in politics.Meanwhile, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi accepted the results of Delhi assembly elections and thanked the party workers and supporters.In a social media post on X, Rahul said that the party will continue to fight against pollution, inflation, and corruption in the capital.""We humbly accept the mandate of Delhi. A heartfelt thanks to all the Congress workers for their dedication and to all the voters for their support,"" Rahul said.""The fight against pollution, inflation, and corruption, as well as for the progress of Delhi and the rights of its citizens, will continue,"" he added.The Congress has yet again failed to open its account in the Delhi assembly - earning the dubious distinction of scoring a hat trick of zeros. The grand-old-party, which ruled Delhi for 15 years on the trot from 1998 to 2013, has been rejected by the people of Delhi now in three consecutive assembly elections.The BJP won 48 of the 70 seats at stake and the AAP was way behind with 22, according to the Election Commission website. The elections were largely seen as a bipolar contest between the AAP, which made a determined bid for a fourth term, and the BJP. While the AAP had 62 members in the outgoing house, the saffron party had just eight legislators.","Amit shah takes a potshot at the grand-old-party in a social media post.

Now the People of Delhi will receive the benefits of Double Engine Govt in the National Capital as Mr Farziwal has been swept out of power,"" Adhikari posted on X.The Bengal BJP unit also hailed the party's good performance in the Delhi polls, terming it a rejection of corruption and nepotism, while the TMC, which had backed the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), maintained silence on the outcome.State BJP chief and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar said the verdict in Delhi reflected people's faith in development and would serve as a morale booster for party workers in West Bengal ahead of next year's assembly elections.The BJP is poised to form a government in Delhi after more than 26 years, with the latest Election Commission trends showing the saffron party ahead in 45 of the 70 assembly seats and AAP in 21 seats.""The people of Bengal will also vote for the BJP in the next assembly polls and reject the TMC,"" Majumdar told news agency.The 2021 West Bengal assembly election resulted in a decisive victory for the All India Trinamool Congress (TMC), led by chief minister Mamata Banerjee, securing 213 out of 294 seats.

In such a situation, what will happen if Kejriwal defeats Parvesh Verma? Can the latter still hope to become Delhi’s chief minister?Unlike other states, Delhi does not have the concept of Member of Legislative Council, which is the route Uddhav Thackeray took to become the chief minister of Maharashtra.

If BJP forms the government and chooses Parvesh Verma to be the chief minister, then Parvesh Verma will have to win a Delhi assembly seat in 6 months time. Usually in such cases, the winning party asks one of its MLAs to vacate a relatively ‘safer’ seat for the chief minister, and then bypolls are held.Originating from an influential political family in Delhi, Parvesh Verma is the son of former BJP leader and Delhi chief minister Sahib Singh Verma. His uncle, Azad Singh, previously held the position of North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor and contested from Mundka constituency as a BJP candidate in the 2013 assembly elections.His political journey began in 2013 when he emerged victorious in the Delhi Legislative Assembly elections from the Mehrauli constituency.Subsequently, he clinched the West Delhi parliamentary seat in 2014 and secured a remarkable re-election in 2019, winning by a substantial margin of 5.78 lakh votes.Ahead of the 2025 Delhi elections, Parvesh Verma launched a campaign titled ""Remove Kejriwal, Save the Nation"", highlighting the alleged failures of the current AAP government in delivering their core promises.During his campaign, Verma sharply criticised the Delhi government's administrative capabilities, particularly their approach towards pollution management, women's safety, and urban infrastructure development. He emphasised their unfulfilled promise regarding the cleaning of the Yamuna River, which continues to pose a significant environmental issue for Delhi.","Bjp's parvesh verma is locked in a very tight battle against aap’s arvind kejriwal.

NEW DELHI: In a few hours on Saturday, the fate of a high-octane electoral contest for Delhi's 70 assembly seats will be known. While the contest to form the next govt is largely considered to be between the incumbent AAP and BJP, which has sat in the opposition since 1998, Congress might disrupt the calculations of the two with a surprise or two.The counting of votes will begin at 8am and the broad trends will be available as early as 10.30am.By 1pm, Delhi may well know who will govern the city for the next five years.While AAP and Congress fielded 70 candidates each, BJP contested 68, leaving two to its two allies, Janata Dal (United) and Loktantrik Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas). But there were 699 candidates in total - 603 men, 95 women and a third-gender contestant. Over 60.5% of voters, or 9,451,997 of 15,614,000 electors, visited the polling stations on Feb 5.Delhi's chief electoral officer, R Alice Vaz, said the electronic voting machines were secure in 70 strong rooms, each for one assembly constituency, under multi-layered security across 19 locations.Most exit polls have predicted a close contest, with BJP given the edge in terms of seats and vote share. Winning a minority 28 seats, AAP formed the govt with the outside support of Congress in 2013, which lasted only 49 days. The subsequent election in 2015 saw the party gain a massive mandate with 67 of 70 seats in its kitty. In 2020, AAP reprised its triumph, winning 62 seats while BJP got the remaining eight. Congress again failed to open its account.None of the parties are laying any store by the exit polls. AAP senior Saurabh Bharadwaj told reporters on Wednesday that the exit polls had similarly predicted defeat in 2013 and 2015 and victory in 2020 but with fewer seats. ""Exit polls have always shown AAP getting fewer votes. But in several areas of my constituency, people stopped their vehicles to tell me AAP would win,"" he claimed.AAP sought a third term based on its performance in health, education, water and other sectors, including providing free power and water to frugal consumers and free bus rides to women in public transport. It has promised more welfare schemes for women, senior citizens and other sections of society.Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva exuded optimism of his party being elected with a huge margin. ""Our victory will be more spectacular than what exit polls show,"" he asserted on Friday. BJP, which has been out of office for nearly 26 years, assured it would continue the welfare schemes already implemented and proposed several new benefits for various sections of society. It also promised bigger development with a ""double-engine govt"".Delhi Congress president Devender Yadav said his party fought a very good election whatever the exit poll said. ""Our efforts will be converted into a vote bank. We worked diligently at the grassroots level to revive our cadre,"" he said, having taken the opportunity to remind Delhi of massive development under Sheila Dikshit's Congress govt from 1998 to 2013.","The counting of votes will begin at 8am and the broad trends will be available as early as 10.30am.

Exit poll track record: A look back



2013: Underestimating AAP's rise



2015: A landslide that no poll saw coming



2020: Polls more accurate, but still off the mark



NEW DELHI: With only two days between voting and results, debates over exit polls heated-up as two more surveys were released on Thursday, echoing earlier predictions. Aam Aadmi Party , however, dismissed all projections, arguing that pollsters have ""historically"" underestimated its performance.Most exit polls were released on Wednesday shortly after voting concluded in Delhi. They largely predicted a BJP comeback in the capital after 27 years, dealing a major setback to AAP, which has ruled for over a decade and remains a strong political force.AAP national spokesperson Reena Gupta cited past election trends, emphasising that exit polls had misjudged the party’s success in 2013, 2015, and 2020. ""Every time, AAP was predicted to win fewer seats than it actually did,"" she said. Senior leader Sanjay Singh went further, ridiculing the projections as ""surveys by massage and spa companies.""Kejriwal said in his post on X: ""These predictions are meant to shape political sentiment and weaken our party by causing defections.""Moreover, majority of pollsters have missed the mark in recent elections, including the 2024 Lok Sabha polls and state assembly elections in Haryana, Jharkhand, and Maharashtra.Exit polls in 2013 largely favoured the BJP, predicting an average of 35 seats—just short of a majority—while forecasting 17 each for AAP and Congress The actual results, however, saw AAP win 28 seats, BJP 32, and Congress just 8.The closest prediction came from Today’s Chanakya, which estimated AAP would win 31 seats. The party, propelled by the India Against Corruption movement, formed a short-lived government with Congress support before resigning over the Jan Lokpal Bill after 48-days of assuming power.Six exit polls in 2015 forecast an AAP victory but failed to grasp its scale. While the average prediction gave AAP 45 seats, the party stunned observers by winning 67.BJP scored just 3, and Congress was left with no legislators in the assembly.The highest estimate for AAP came from Axis My India at 53 seats, while India TV-CVoter predicted only 39. Most polls also overestimated BJP’s chances, with many projecting over 20 seats.By 2020, exit polls were more aligned with AAP’s dominance but still fell short of the final numbers. On average, they predicted 52 seats for AAP and 17 for BJP, while the actual results saw AAP win 62 and BJP secure 8. Congress, once again, failed to win a single seat.India Today-Axis My India provided the closest estimate, forecasting 59-68 seats for AAP. Meanwhile, Sudarshan News gave BJP its highest projected tally at 24-28 seats, though the party ultimately fell far below that mark.","Most exit polls were released on wednesday shortly after voting concluded in delhi.

A historic moment for Delhi



The results for the 2025 Delhi Assembly elections are set to be announced on Saturday, February 8, marking a pivotal moment in the Capital's political landscape. The election, held in a single phase on February 5, saw over 15 million eligible voters casting their ballots across 70 Assembly constituencies.A total of 699 candidates, including 603 male and 96 female contenders, vied for the electorate's mandate.The stakes are high as the ruling Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) seeks a fourth consecutive term, while the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP ) aims to reclaim power after nearly 27 years. The Congress , once a dominant force in Delhi politics, is hoping to regain some lost ground.The counting process will be conducted under strict security and transparency measures. 5,000 personnel have been deployed to ensure a smooth and fair counting process.The Returning Officer (RO) in each constituency will oversee the process, which includes the counting of Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) votes and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips.Five VVPATs from each constituency will be randomly selected for verification to ensure accuracy.In case of a tie, the winner is decided by a draw of lots. A recount can be demanded by a polling agent if irregularities are suspected.The election has seen high-profile contests in several constituencies, with prominent leaders from AAP, BJP, and Congress locking horns:Exit polls have painted a mixed picture, with most predicting a BJP victory after nearly three decades. However, some projections suggest a close contest between the BJP and AAP, while the Congress is expected to play a minor role.A party needs 36 seats to form a majority in the 70-member Delhi Assembly. The BJP, which last governed Delhi in 1998, is projected to emerge as the single largest party, while AAP is expected to face a significant setback. The Congress, which ruled Delhi for 15 years until 2013, is hoping to recover from its dismal performance in the last two elections, where it failed to win a single seat.The 2025 Delhi Assembly elections are a crucial test for both AAP and BJP. AAP, led by Arvind Kejriwal, has been in power since 2015, winning 67 seats in 2015 and 62 seats in 2020. A victory would solidify Kejriwal's position as Delhi's leader and boost his national political profile. However, exit polls suggest that AAP may fall short of a majority, with the BJP poised to make a comeback.The BJP, under the leadership of Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva , has campaigned aggressively, focusing on issues like pollution, water shortages, and infrastructure. The party has also accused AAP of corruption and mismanagement, while AAP has blamed the central government for obstructing its work.The Congress, led by Rahul Gandhi, has attempted to revive its fortunes by highlighting issues like the Yamuna water crisis and corruption allegations against AAP. However, the party's prospects remain bleak, with most exit polls predicting a marginal presence in the Assembly.The election has been marred by controversies, with AAP accusing the BJP of attempting to poach its candidates by offering Rs 15 crore and a ministerial position. Delhi’s Lt Governor VK Saxena has ordered an anti-corruption branch probe into the allegations. The BJP, in turn, has demanded that AAP retract its accusations or face legal action.A loss in Delhi could weaken AAP's position in other states like Punjab, Gujarat, and Goa.The party's national ambitions may suffer a setback, with its focus likely to shift back to Delhi.A victory for the AAP will establish Kejriwal's dominance in Delhi and enhance his political stature nationally.A victory would mark the BJP's return to power in Delhi after 27 years, ending AAP's dominance.The party's success in Delhi could bolster its position ahead of assembly elections in Bihar and ther states.A loss in Delhi will prove to be a major morale buster as heavyweight leaders like PM Modi and UP CM Yogi Adityanath campaigned extensively across the Capital.The Congress, which ruled Delhi for 15 years in a row till 2013, is striving to stage a comeback after failing to win a single seat in the previous two elections. An improvement in its performance could provide a much-needed morale boost.The party may use AAP's potential loss to regain its foothold in Delhi and other states.The 2025 Delhi Assembly elections are a historic moment for the capital, with the potential to reshape its political landscape. As the counting of votes begins on February 8, all eyes will be on the results to see whether AAP can secure a fourth term or if the BJP will make a triumphant comeback. The Congress, though a minor player, will be hoping to stage a revival. Whatever the outcome, the results will have far-reaching implications for the future of Delhi and Indian politics.","Exit polls suggest that aap may fall short of a majority, with the bjp poised to make a comeback.

British Navy for first time allows female personnel to wear saris at mess dinners,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/british-navy-for-first-time-allows-female-personnel-to-wear-saris-at-mess-dinners/articleshow/118038603.cms,"LONDON: The Royal Navy has announced its personnel will now be allowed to wear cultural dress such as saris as part of their formal dress code to make its uniform policy more inclusive.Personnel are now permitted to wear saris, salwar kameez, lehengas and other cultural dress, beneath their mess jackets at formal mess dinners following lobbying by the UK service’s race diversity network. They will also have to wear a black bow tie and white shirt on top of the sari to maintain existing standards of identifiable naval uniform above the waist. This is how it is with the wearing of kilts and tartan dresses.The new cultural mess dress policy applies to anyone in the Royal Navy (RN) entitled to wear mess kits and is only applicable at formal mess dinners.An RN spokesperson told TOI: “Wearing cultural mess dress is an established tradition within the Royal Navy and personnel of Scottish, Irish, Welsh, Cornish and Manx (relating to Isle of Man) heritage have been permitted to wear a kilt for some years as part of the uniform. We have extended this recently to include other types of cultural dress below the waist. We are proud to welcome people from a variety of backgrounds.”Lance Cpl Jack Kanani, chair of the RN race diversity network, announced the new policy on Linkedin with a photo of British Pakistani Hon Capt Durdana Ansari wearing a white sari beneath a mess jacket, with a shirt and bow tie. Existing RN cultural mess dress policy had been updated to “include wider forms of British cultural identity,” he wrote. “The network canvassed opinions from ethnic minority service personnel to understand how widening existing policy on cultural mess dress would made them feel able to celebrate both their RN and cultural heritage,” he added.His post sparked strong reactions on Linkedin with some veterans saying the point of the armed services is to look the same, be the same, feel the same and fight the same, and this is “woke culture gone too far”. Others praised the initiative, saying it allowed people to keep their cultural and religious identity and serve.Rear Admiral Philip Mathias (Retd) wrote: “The reason for uniform in a disciplined fighting service is to achieve a common identify, not to accentuate the differences. Having commanded in two wars/conflicts, I would be more interested in the RN leadership focusing on instilling a culture of war fighting, rather than obsessing about DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion).”","Royal navy personnel allowed to wear saris, salwar kameez, lehengas and other cultural dress beneath mess jackets at formal mess dinners.

AHMEDABAD: Jhulasan in Gujarat's Gandhinagar had an unlikely lift-off to fame two decades ago when it emerged as the village to which Nasa astronaut Sunita Williams traces her roots. The comfort of obscurity is what its 5,000-odd residents might now prefer as spotlight shifts to around two dozen men from the village, all illegal immigrants to the US, amid reports that they have gone incommunicado.Till late Friday, two days after a US military aircraft carrying 104 Indian deportees landed in Punjab's Amritsar, there was still no clarity on whether the group from Jhulasan had illegally entered American territory or were in transit.""The horror stories some of these deportees have returned with are adding to our anxiety over the whereabouts of the two dozen men who remain untraceable,"" a village elder said.One school of thought is that dodgy immigration agents might have advised the missing men not to contact their families or relatives until they settle there. ""They may be en route to their destinations or in some hideout along the route,"" the villager said.Sarpanch Mani Patel said around 3,000 villagers were from the Patidar community, of whom nearly 2,000 were based in the US. ""People from my village go to the US in the hope of finding employment that would enable them to earn several times more than they would in India. Peer pressure is also a factor. Some of us earn reasonably well here, but the US holds the promise of a better life, even at the risk of illegal immigration ,"" Patel said.Illegal immigration is rampant in many villages.

NEW DELHI: Two more exit polls for Delhi assembly elections, Axis My India and Today's Chanakya, on Thursday predicted clean sweep for the Bharatiya Janata Party and placed Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) at a distant second. AAP has categorically dismissed the exit poll results stating that pollsters have ""historically"" underestimated its performance.Most exit polls predicted a comeback for BJP in Delhi after 27 years and a big setback for the ruling AAP.AAP national spokesperson Reena Gupta said the exit polls have consistently underestimated the Arvind Kejriwal-led party, and in reality, the party often outperforms these projections.""Look at any exit poll from 2013, 2015, or 2020 – the AAP was always predicted to win fewer seats. But we ended up securing many more in the actual results,"" Gupta said.Senior AAP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh also dismissed the projections, calling them ""surveys by massage and spa companies"".: Exit polls are just projections made by election survey agencies based on interviews of voters as they come out after casting their votes. They might not hold true on the day of results. The Election Commission will announce Delhi assembly results on February 8.In 2013, an average of four exit polls placed BJP in a strong position, predicting 35 seats, just one shy of a majority. They forecast AAP and Congress each securing 17 seats. However, the actual results saw the BJP winning 32 seats, AAP securing 28, and Congress just 8. The exit polls significantly underestimated AAP’s rise, with the party building on the India Against Corruption movement. With support from Congress, AAP formed government that lasted only 48 days, before Kejriwal resigned over the failure to pass the Jan Lokpal Bill and Delhi was placed under President’s Rule.Two exit polls — Headlines Today-ORG and ABP-Neilsen—overestimated BJP's strength, predicting 41 and 37 seats, respectively. All four polls also overestimated Congress's performance, predicting it would win in double digits. The most accurate exit poll was Today's Chanakya, which predicted AAP would win 31 seats, BJP 29, and Congress 10. On average, the polls were off by 11 seats for AAP, while giving three additional seats to the BJP and nine extra to Congress.In 2015, six exit polls predicted an outright AAP victory, but none could foresee the extent of its triumph. The average of these polls estimated AAP would win 45 seats, BJP 24, and Congress just one. In reality, AAP won 67 seats, leaving BJP with just three. No exit poll predicted that AAP would exceed 60 seats, and only one, Axis My India, predicted the party would win over 50 seats, estimating 53. The lowest estimate came from India TV-CVoter, which projected 39 seats for AAP.For the BJP, exit polls suggested a much stronger performance, but not enough to challenge AAP. All but one poll predicted BJP would secure more than 20 seats, with Axis My India’s estimate of 17 seats being the lowest. Two agencies, Today's Chanakya and Axis My India, correctly predicted that Congress would fail to win any seats. However, other polls were more optimistic about Congress, with India Today-Cicero projecting it would win four seats, its highest estimate. The average of the six exit polls was off by 22 seats for AAP and predicted BJP would win 21 more seats than it actually did.By 2020, with 10 exit polls conducted, predictions for a strong AAP victory were once again widespread, with an average forecast of 52 seats for AAP, 17 for BJP, and just 1 for Congress.However, AAP performed even better, securing 62 seats, while BJP managed only 8. The Times Now-Ipsos exit poll was the first to report, predicting 47 seats for AAP and 23 for BJP. The India Today-Axis My India poll predicted between 59 and 68 seats for AAP, and 2 to 11 seats for BJP.Sudarshan News predicted 24-28 seats for BJP, the highest projection for the party by any agency. However, AAP was expected to win only 41-45 seats according to Sudarshan News. The ABP News-C voter exit poll projected between 49 and 63 seats for AAP, and 5 to 19 seats for BJP, while the Republic TV-Jan Ki Baat exit poll predicted between 48 and 61 seats for AAP, and 9 to 21 for BJP.India TV projected 44 seats for AAP and 26 for BJP. In the 2015 elections, AAP secured a historic mandate, winning 67 out of 70 seats, with BJP taking just 3 and Congress failing to open its account.Despite some improvement in exit poll accuracy in 2020, the predictions still undershot AAP’s electoral performance, which solidified the party’s dominance in Delhi politics.","Two more exit polls for delhi assembly elections predicted clean sweep for bjp.

NEW DELHI: As the Bharatiya Janata Party crossed the halfway mark of 36 seats in the Delhi assembly election results, the focus has now shifted to who would be the saffron party's chief ministerial face.BJP leader Virendraa Sachdeva said on Saturday said that the party's CM face would be decided by the ""central leadership"".Taking on this question of ""BJP ka dulha kaun"", as AAP had attacked the party for not announcing a CM face during the campaign, Sachdeva said, ""Central leadership will decide (CM's face).This issue doesn't matter much to us. Those (AAP) who betray people, the people will treat them like this (defeat) only,"" he said.Meanwhile, exit polls had presented a mixed picture, with most predicting a BJP victory after nearly three decades. While some projections indicated a close contest between BJP and AAP, Congress was expected to have a limited impact. Seat estimates suggested BJP could secure 35 to 49 seats, AAP may win between 21 and 37, while Congress is projected to gain up to three seats.The son of former Delhi CM Sahib Singh Verma, is contesting against AAP national convenor and former CM Arvind Kejriwal from New Delhi seat. He has started trailing after leading in early poll trends.AAP had declared Bidhuri as BJP's CM face and had invited him for a debate during poll campaigns, only get BJP's flack, who said that the party's CM face was yet to be decided. Bidhuri is contesting from Kalkaji seat against Delhi CM Atishi.""We are here to serve public, not for any position like CM,"" he said when asked about the top post.Contesting from Bijwasan, Gahlot is another potential BJP CM candidate. He is currently leading from the seat.Contesting from Karawal Nagar, Mishra is leading from his constituency, as per early trends.Lovely, a former Delhi Congress president, is contesting from Gandhi Nagar as a BJP candidate after switching to the party ahead of the Delhi elections. He is, however, trailing as per the early trends.The senior BJP leader is a strong contender for the chief ministerial post if the party secures victory in Delhi. A former Delhi BJP chief, he has consistently held the Rohini seat, winning in both 2015 and 2020 despite AAP's dominance. Gupta also served as leader of the opposition in the Delhi assembly, with his experience and resilience making him a key figure in the party’s leadership calculations.In 2013, AAP formed the government with Congress's outside support after winning 28 seats, but the tenure lasted only 49 days.

Sawant had previously served on the Seattle City Council .She in a post on X said that her husband's visa has been approved while her application was rejected for the third time because of her name being on a ""reject list"".Meanwhile, the Indian consulate on social media platforms posted about ""unauthorised entry by certain individuals"", while Sawant countered with allegations of physical assault by officials.Additionally, the activist blamed PM Modi and the BJP administration regarding the situation.Previously, she had protested against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the National Register of Citizens (NRC), and supported the farmers' protests.Sawant, who was born in Pune, earned her bachelor's degree from the University of Mumbai in 1994. Later, she relocated to the United States and obtained her doctorate in economics from North Carolina State University in 2003.Prior to her political career, she served as an economics educator at the tertiary level for three years.

However, her critical stance towards the Indian government and anti-Hindu comments have caused discontent among Indian American groups and community leaders.In 2023, under her leadership, Seattle became the first US city to prohibit caste-based discrimination through council legislation. This move drew significant opposition from Hindu Americans, who argued that it unfairly targeted their community, which already experiences discrimination in the US.In 2020, she successfully pushed through a Seattle City Council resolution opposing the CAA and NRC, claiming these measures ""discriminating against women, Muslims, members of suppressed castes, indigenous and LGBT individuals"".","Kshama sawant was denied an emergency visa to see her unwell mother in bengaluru.

NEW DELHI: Even as EC drafts a response to questions raised by Rahul Gandhi on Maharashtra voter list, what seems to have caught its attention are the fluctuating numbers claimed by him thrice: 1 crore on Jan 15, 70 lakh on the floor of Lok Sabha on Feb 3 and 39 lakh at Friday's presser.EC sources said none of the three was correct, even though the poll panel had, in a letter to Congress on Dec 24, 2024, shared the exact figure of 48.8 lakh additions made to the state rolls between LS and assembly polls, reports Bharti Jain.In a formal response on X to INDIA bloc allegations, ECI, headed by Rajiv Kumar, said Friday it ""would respond in writing with full factual and procedural matrix uniformly adopted across"" India.EC also noted that political parties were ""priority stakeholders"" and their views, suggestions and questions were ""deeply valued"".In its Dec 2024 letter refuting Congress's allegations on Maharashtra rolls, the commission had explained that 26.4 lakh of the 48.8 lakh additions made between LS and assembly polls last year were new voters in the age group of 18-29 years. With over 8 lakh deletions, the net addition to the state's rolls was around 40.8 lakh, EC had said.On Rahul's demand that EC share the exact list of voters who exercised their franchise in Maharashtra, commission sources said Section 93 of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1951, did not allow for providing names and addresses of voters as it would violate secrecy of vote and put voters at risk of post-election intimidation.Stating that the poll panel has already shared with Congress names, addresses and polling booths of all voters in Maharashtra Lok Sabha and assembly polls and the exact number of voters, booth-wise, in Form 20 as well as in Form 17C (available with each candidate), it underlined that this could not be the case with Form 17A as it has the signature/thumb impression of the elector and also details and number of the identification document produced by her for voting. Form 17A is kept in safe custody of the returning officer and not opened for inspection except under court order.","Ec sources said none of the three was correct, even though the poll panel had, in a letter to congress on dec 24, 2024, shared the exact figure of 48.8 lakh additions made to the state rolls between ls and assembly polls.
