“Arindatri Cheygirparkku Allaal Vinaidhaan







Sirandhaanendru Evearpaart Randru.”

Sheryl Sandberg once wrote about an incident from her early days at Facebook. There was a floor reserved exclusively for directors, where there were no restrooms for women. Not because anyone opposed the idea — but because no one had imagined a woman would rise to that level. It was not hostility, but the soft silence of assumption. This, in essence, is how unconscious bias operates: quietly, invisibly, and often without intent.It is far more pervasive than open prejudice. It does not walk in announcing itself; it seeps into our choices disguised as instinct.Some of the most damaging kinds of favouritism is almost innocent — the kind that arises from unconscious bias. No doors are slammed. No words are spoken. Yet someone is quietly not considered or included. To the decision-maker, it may even feel perfectly fair.I was reminded of this recently during my visit to Sydney, where I addressed a warm and vibrant Tamil gathering. As soon as the programme ended, I rushed to the airport in the same attire I had worn on stage — my favourite sari, a, and slippers without heels. The organisers had booked me in business class, and check-in went smoothly.At the gate, an airline employee took one glance at me and directed me towards the economy class without checking my boarding pass. Only at the aircraft door did another crew member gently redirect me. I did not need to ask why. My profile — a South Indian woman travelling alone, in traditional attire with an unbranded handbag — simply didn’t match her mental picture of a business class passenger. I recall Sudha Murthy narrating a similar experience. She was waiting to board an international flight in the business class passenger line. She was dressed simply, and a couple of fellow women passengers behind her asked her to switch to the economy queue. They felt that they are rendering a helping hand to a passenger!The Sydney airport incident did not offend me. But it made me think. If these assumptions exist in others, do any such layers lie quietly within us too?Remnants of bias are in all of us — carried through culture, upbringing, fears.A recent incident involving actor Gauri Kishan revealed how deeply unconscious bias prevails. At a film press meet, a YouTuber casually asked the hero, “What was the heroine’s weight when you lifted her for that shot?” Gauri immediately objected, but a few reporters kept interrupting her, determined to drown her voice, defending the question.In their world of beliefs, such questions about women were normal — even acceptable. It would never occur to them to treat a man in the same way. Their confidence came from conditioning not cruelty. That is the quiet danger of unconscious bias: it makes the unreasonable appear reasonable.In workplaces, this bias influences hiring, promotions, and leadership opportunities. Organizations need inclusive policies and continuous reflection to ensure fair treatment and equity in preparing the floor for all employees to raise to their potential.Thiruvalluvar’s chapter Therindhu Vinayaadal – Art of Right Choice – is as good as an HR hiring guidebook especially couplet 515:Make competence the basis of your choice — not thePreferences or partialities of the hirer.Unconscious bias whispers: favouritism follows. To hear that whisper, and question it, is the first step towards a fairer world — one where ability shines sans prejudices.","Thirukkural with the times explores real-world lessons from the classic tamil text.

Rs 10k crore: Cost of health cover fraud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-10k-crore-cost-of-health-cover-fraud/articleshow/125497230.cms,"MUMBAI: Fraud and waste continue to drag India’s health-insurance system, with Rs 8,000–10,000 crore leaking from claim payouts each year, says a Boston Consulting Group–Medi Assist report. Fraud and unnecessary claims inflate premiums, strain insurer finances and drain public funds. Weak data systems and loose checks also push patients into higher out-of-pocket spends.The analysis shows retail health portfolios carry higher fraud risk than group portfolios. Within group covers, fraud is consistently elevated in BFSI and healthcare. Reimbursement claims pose the biggest threat: group reimbursement claims show 9x more fraud than group cashless, while individual reimbursement claims show 20x the incidence of group cashless. Misrepresentation and document fabrication remain the top fraud types across IPD/OPD. Fraud risk clusters in mid-ticket claims (Rs 50,000-Rs 2.5 lakh), where incentives are high and oversight moderate.“Small-ticket fraud and abuse are often rationalised as harmless… This mindset has turned into a systemic behavioral challenge… contributing materially to the broader issue of FWA (fraud, waste and abuse) in the health insurance ecosystem,” the report said.The report urges tighter fraud prevention/detection, unified medical-coding rules, AI-driven oversight and faster data-sharing via the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission and the National Health Claim Exchange.Medi Assist says tech will do the heavy lifting. “As India’s health system stands at an inflection point, the next decade will be defined by connected data and intelligent automation,” said Satish Gidugu, Medi Assist’s CEO. Reducing fraud and rebuilding digital trust, he said, will help keep care “accessible, affordable, and accountable for all citizens.”For BCG’s Swayamjit Mishra, the biggest gains lie in the “remaining 8%” of claims that sit between harmless and outright fraudulent.","Fraud and waste continue to drag india’s health-insurance system, says a boston consulting group–medi assist report.

NEW DELHI: ""The accused cannot be made to suffer endlessly with this threat of continuing investigation,"" the Supreme Court said, holding that the right to speedy investigation is also part of fundamental rights. The court said it will benefit the accused, the victim, and society if the investigation and trial are done quickly and completed within a reasonable time.Though it refrained from framing any timeline for completion of probe, which it said was not practical and feasible, a bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and N Kotiswar Singh said that an accused could approach courts for quashing of a case for inordinate delay in the probe.

After GST rollout, state finance portfolio lost some sheen

Bihar CM Nitish Kumar has ceded the home portfolio to BJP for the first time in his two decades at the helm and his party JDU has, in lieu, got control of finance, which was kept by BJP.Though it may appear like a regular ministry swap which happens between allies, the significance of deputy CM Samrat Choudhary being given charge of home was lost on few as the department is considered politically crucial due to its control of police, intelligence and general law & order, a reason why CMs in most states keep the portfolio to themselves. This is also a big boost for Choudhary and puts him in a higher weight category vis-a-vis his party colleague and the other deputy CM, Vijay Sinha, who has got revenue & land reforms and mines & geology departments, a notification said.Sources said that the new arrangement would also see political inputs accommodated into the functioning of the crucial department, which had lately been perceived to be run by bureaucrats.JDU's Bijendra Prasad Yadav has been vested with finance and commercial tax department, held by Choudhary in the last govt. The rising Kushwaha figure of BJP is now in charge of the state's law & order, and has no other department.As Nitish distributed portfolios among his 26 ministers - 14 from BJP, eight from JDU, two from LJP(RV) and one each from HAM(S) and RLM, the two main parties seemed to be keeping most of the key departments they earlier had, save for the exchange of home and finance.The finance ministry in states has lost some of its sheen as levers of revenue generation are limited for them after GST rollout, more so in Bihar where liquor is not a source of filling coffers due to prohibition since 2016.The decision of Nitish, whose 'sushasan babu' image owed much to his handling of law and order as he ensured minimal political interference in policing, to part with the ministry hints at the growing recognition in JDU circles about the need to relieve him of a part of his responsibilities as well as BJP's growing heft in the alliance after the party's national brass led by PM Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah played a central role in shepherding the NDA's campaign that decimated the opposition.CMs in most states, including Yogi Adityanath in UP, M K Stalin in Tamil Nadu, Devendra Fadnavis in Maharashtra and N Chandrababu Naidu in Andhra Pradesh, are in charge of home, or law & order, as it is referred in some places. In Congress-governed Karnataka, the home ministry has been given to G Parameshwara but CM Siddaramaiah has kept 'intelliegence' with himself.There have been, however, examples of allies getting the home department. In the previous Mahayuti govt headed by Shiv Sena's Eknath Shinde, his deputy and BJP's Fadnavis was in charge of the portfolio. In the Maha Vikas Aghadi govt that preceded Shinde's, NCP's Anil Deshmukh was the home minister in the dispensation headed by Shiv Sena's Uddhav Thackeray. Both NCP and Shiv Sena had split and the new factions, which later got the official status, became partners in subsequent Mahayuti govt.Among current state govts, deputy CM Vijay Sharma holds the home ministry in BJP-governed Chhattisgarh.Nitish has kept the portfolios of the general administration department, cabinet secretariat and vigilance with himself. Vijay Chowdhary, a close aide of Nitish, will helm building construction, water resources and parliamentary affairs. The party has not named its choices for six other departments that have come its way, with sources saying that the picks would be finalised later.BJP has continued to keep health, law, industries, road construction, urban development and housing, and agriculture in its quota First-time minister BJP's Shreyasi Singh, a former international shooter, has been given sports, and information and technology. Deepak Prakash of RLM and HAM(S)'s Santosh Suman have been given the portfolios of panchayati raj department and minor water resources department, respectively.LJP (RV) MLAs Sanjay Kumar and Sanjay Kumar Singh are in charge of sugarcane and public health engineering department, respectively.","Bihar cm nitish kumar has ceded the home portfolio to bjp for the first time in his two decades at the helm.

"Minimum wage to social security, labour reforms set for rollout",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/minimum-wage-to-social-security-labour-reforms-set-for-rollout/articleshow/125495028.cms,"Codes cap share of allowances in overall package

NEW DELHI: In one of the biggest reform initiatives, the Centre on Friday announced the implementation of the four labour codes, enacted five years ago, to replace 29 laws. The rollout, which will require notification of rules, comes within a week of a resounding electoral mandate in Bihar for the governing NDA after similar successes in Maharashtra, Haryana, and Delhi.The biggest workforce regulation recast in decades is aimed at increasing the employability of women and ensuring safety, ensuring that gig workers are eligible for social security benefits, salaries are paid on time, and minimum wage is guaranteed.At the same time, the laws provide more flexibility and certainty to businesses at a time when the economy is dealing with global headwinds. Investors have often cited India's archaic labour laws as one of the stumbling blocks while deciding on setting up factories in India and have flocked to countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh amid diversification of production bases.PM Modi called it the ""most comprehensive and progressive labour-oriented reforms since Independence"".Officials said the rules for these four codes - on wages, industrial relations, social security and occupational safety and health - will be notified within 45 days for enforcement of the provisions.While the Centre had enacted the laws as part of the response to the Covid crisis, reluctance in opposition-led states had prompted it to go slow.But with more than two dozen states showing willingness to move ahead with amendments in laws, the Modi govt decided to press ahead after extensive consultations.All states, except West Bengal, have published draft rules on the provisions of the four codes, officials said.In any case, states that fail to notify the rules will have to follow those finalised by the Centre since labour is a subject under the concurrent list.The codes cap share of allowances in overall compensation paid to salaried employee to ensure companies don't structure pays in a way that it results in lower social-security contribution by employers. For workers, there's a national floor wage, and states can notify higher payment.ILO director-general Gilbert F Houngbo said, ""Following with interest developments of India's new labour codes announced today...""Under the new regime, fixed-term employees become eligible for gratuity after one year and social security coverage is expanded to all. All workers will get PF, ESIC, insurance, and other social security benefits. In addition, several sectors will now have mandatory annual health check-ups for their employees who are more than 40 years old.","The rollout comes within a week of a resounding electoral mandate in bihar for the governing nda.

Calm And Radical: Dr Umar’s Pre-Blast Video Exposes Educated New Face Of Terror Behind Delhi Attack

FARIDABAD: A video showing 2,600kg of ammonium nitrate recovered from a cleric’s house in Faridabad on 9 November has resurfaced as the investigation into the Delhi car blast deepens.The video, filmed a day before the Red Fort car blast that killed 15 people, shows a house in an isolated location with sacks of ammonium nitrate stacked inside.The rented room cost Rs 1,500 a month.Investigators are also examining whether the arrested doctors, Shaheen Shahid and Muzammil Shakeel, bought multiple vehicles as part of a broader serial bombing plot linked to the Delhi attack.Initial findings suggest the duo may have arranged or financed several cars intended to be used as vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs) for an “anniversary revenge attack” allegedly planned for the Babri Masjid demolition anniversary on 6 December.Separately, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has arrested Amir, a resident of Pampore in Jammu and Kashmir, who allegedly conspired with suicide bomber Umar Un Nabi to carry out the attack.“Amir had travelled to Delhi to facilitate the purchase of the i20 car that was converted into a VBIED for the blast,” a senior NIA official said.The agency has also seized another vehicle linked to bomber Dr Umar, which is undergoing forensic examination for explosive residue, fingerprints and digital evidence.Investigators are checking whether Shaheen and Shakeel, both associated with Al-Falah University, helped procure additional cars beyond those already traced.Meanwhile, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday took custody of three doctors and a preacher who were arrested in connection with the November 10 car blast outside the Red Fort in which 15 people were killed.Muzammil Ganaie, Adeel Rather and Shaheena Saeed as well as Maulvi Irfan Ahmed Wagay had been arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir police following the blast.""They had all played a key role in the terror attack that killed several innocent persons and left many others injured,"" an NIA spokesperson said.With their custody shifting to the NIA, which formally took over the case on November 11, the number of people booked by the federal agency has gone up to six.The NIA has already arrested two people -- Amir Rashid Ali and Jasir Bilal Wani alias Danish.Dr Umar-un-Nabi, who was driving the explosives-laden i20 that detonated, had allegedly bought the car in Ali’s name. Wani was arrested after it emerged that Umar had been trying to convince him to become a suicide bomber. He was not persuaded but is alleged to have agreed to participate as an overground worker for the banned terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed.Those arrested are alleged to be at the centre of a 'white collar' terror module busted by Jammu and Kashmir police along with their counterparts in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Investigations led to the Al Falah university in Faridabad where 2,900 kg of explosives was recovered.It all started on the intervening night of October 18-19, when posters of the banned JeM surfaced on walls just outside Srinagar city. The posters warned of attacks on police and security forces in the Valley.Srinagar police decided to treat the matter as a serious issue and not just as a one-off incident and Senior Superintendent of Police (Srinagar) G V Sundeep Chakravarthy formed several teams to get into the depth of the case.Three people -- Arif Nisar Dar alias Sahil, Yasir-ul-Ashraf and Maqsood Ahmad Dar alias Shahid -- were arrested after CCTV footage showed them pasting the posters.During interrogation, they named former paramedic turned preacher Maulvi Irfan Ahmed from Shopian as the one who had supplied the posters. He was arrested.This was the thread that led to the unravelling of the plot. It was his interrogation that finally led investigators to Al Falah university and the group of Kashmiri doctors.The first person to be arrested was Ganaie from Faridabad. Then Saeed too from the town. Later, Adeel Rather was picked up from Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh.","A video showing 2,600kg of ammonium nitrate recovered from a cleric’s house in faridabad on 9 november has resurfaced as the investigation into the delhi car blast deepens.

Siddaramaiah vs DK Shivakumar: Why Congress needs to stop the 'nataka' in Karnataka,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/siddaramaiah-vs-dk-shivakumar-why-congress-needs-to-stop-the-nataka-in-karnataka/articleshow/125487596.cms,"'All 140 MLAs Are Mine': DK Shivakumar Amid Karnataka CM Speculation; Siddaramaiah Responds

NEW DELHI: Will the Congress replace Siddaramaiah with D K Shivakumar as the chief minister of Karnataka? Had the top Congress leadership agreed to a power-sharing formula in 2023 to broker truce between two of its tallest leaders in the state - both vying for the top post? While the Congress has refused to clear the air on these questions, the supporters of the two heavyweights have on several occassions made contrary claims in the open much to the embarrassment of the party leadership. Little wonder then on November 20, when Siddaramaiah completed two and a half years as the chief minister, reports quoting Congress sources suggested that at least 15 MLAs and about a dozen MLCs have camped in Delhi to push the party leadership to make Shivakumar the next chief minister.Ironically, Karnataka, which gave the Congress one of its biggest electoral victories in recent times when in 2023 the grand-old party stormed to power with 135 seats in the 224-member state assembly, has also been one of its biggest worries since then.With the Congress leadership dithering - the internal 'nataka' in the state is out in the open like never before forcing the party to issue a stern warning to its MLAs and leaders against making any public statements on the issue of leadership.This even as Siddaramaiah has been quick to interpret the leadership's silence as a tacit approval for his stand on the issue. ""Has the high command spoken on it? We can't help it.Earlier also some people were discussing it, and now they might have gone (to Delhi). Finally, Shivakumar and I have to listen to whatever the high command says,"" the chief minister said when asked about some MLAs and MLCs camping in Delhi.To a question whether he would present the next two state budgets, Siddaramaiah retorted, ""Why are you asking this? Yes, I will continue. I will present the budgets in future also.""Clearly, the chief minister seems to be in no mood to step down. This should worry the Congress as DK Shivakumar , while not raising the pitch himself, has backed the action of his supporters.""All MLAs have the right to visit and meet their leaders. You cannot stop them. You cannot tell them not to go. Many MLAs travel with ministers, and many go with the chief minister. Who has stopped them? No one has troubled them,"" the deputy chief minister said defending the leaders who reportedly went to Delhi in his support.DK Shivakumar, who is also the state Congress president, has made it clear that he expects the party high command to do the needfull. Refusing to join issues with Siddaramaiah, DKS has shifted the onus to party's leadership. ""Our CM has always articulated his ideology. I will not comment on it. He has said the matter is between him and the high command. Siddaramaiah has stated that he will abide by whatever the high command decides. The CM will listen to the high command, and I am also on the same page. We are all committed to the high command’s decision,"" DKS said when asked about Siddaramaiah's claim of completing his full tenure of five years. ""Honourable CM Siddaramaiah has stated that he will complete five years. I wish him all the luck,"" DKS added in a cryptic response.Interestingly, Randeep Singh Surjewala, the AICC general secretary in-charge of Karnataka, tried to put the blame for leadership tussle on a ""decisively defeated and faction-ridden"" BJP, along with a section of the media. ""Had a discussion with Karnataka CM and Deputy CM and they agreed that a decisively defeated and faction ridden Karnataka BJP, along with a section of the media, are designedly running a maligning campaign against Karnataka and its Congress government,"" he alleged in a post on 'X'.

‘We Made No Crime’ Prashant Kishor Admits Failure, Takes Full Responsibility for Bihar Verdict

NEW DELHI: Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor on Friday announced that he will donate 90 per cent of his income over the next five years to fund his party’s campaign. The declaration comes just days after the newly launched party suffered a major setback in its debut Bihar assembly elections , failing to win a single seat despite an energetic start to its campaign.Jan Suraaj drew a blank in the polls, unable to open its account amid a sweeping victory for the NDA.Addressing reporters after a day-long silent fast at the Gandhi Ashram in West Champaran, Kishor also accused the newly formed Nitish Kumar cabinet of being packed with tainted leaders. “The new cabinet of Nitish Kumar, which took oath on Thursday, is full of corrupts and criminals. I must say that this council of ministers is a slap in the face of the people of Bihar. It's like rubbing salt on the wound as several corrupt leaders were inducted,” he alleged.Kishor further claimed the appointments show that “Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and CM Kumar are least concerned about Bihar.” He also accused the ruling alliance of buying votes through cash transfers. “They have purchased votes by transferring Rs 10,000 into the bank account of more than 1 crore women.Now, they have no concern for the state or the people,” he said, adding, “If I am saying anything wrong, the state government can put me behind bars. ”According to him, funds meant for the state’s contingency reserve and a World Bank grant were diverted for the cash transfer scheme. Kishor vowed that his party would ensure women receive the Rs 2 lakh promised by the NDA. “Now, we will ensure that women get Rs 2 lakh as promised by the NDA ahead of the polls,” he said.Kishor also announced the launch of the ‘Bihar Navnirman Sankalp Yatra’ beginning January 15, during which Jan Suraaj workers will visit every household across the state. “We will visit all houses in the state over 15-18 months and create awareness among the people about the misdeeds of this government. The organisation of the Jan Suraaj Party will be strengthened before the campaign starts,” he said.Reiterating his personal commitment, Kishor said, “Besides, whatever assets I have acquired in the last 20 years, except my Delhi house, I will donate those for the party.” He appealed to supporters to contribute as well, saying, “Now, I request the people of Bihar to donate just Rs 1,000 to the party on a yearly basis. I will not meet anyone who doesn't donate this amount to the party.”Invoking Mahatma Gandhi, Kishor said he remains determined. “We will change the government. They tried to break our morale in this election. We will fight and win,” he said.",Jan suraaj founder prashant kishor says he will donate 90 per cent of his income over the next five years to fund his party’s campaign.

NC, PDP on SIA raid at Kashmir Times' office



NEW DELHI: The State Investigation Agency (SIA) of the J&K Police on Thursday raided the Jammu office of the Kashmir Times, alleging that the publication was involved in activities against the country.Officials said the search led to the recovery of AK rifle cartridges, pistol rounds and hand-grenade pins, among other items.According to officials, SIA teams examined the newspaper’s premises and computer systems after registering a case against the publication and its promoters. The promoters are likely to be questioned as the investigation proceeds, PTI reported.The Kashmir Times management sharply criticised the raids, calling the allegations of anti-state activities ""baseless"" and part of a broader attempt to silence ""independent journalism.""Editors Prabodh Jamwal and Anuradha Bhasin, in a joint statement, said, ""The reported raids on our office in Jammu, the baseless accusations of activities inimical to the state and the coordinated crackdown on the Kashmir Times are yet another attempt to silence us.""""Criticising the government is not the same as being inimical to the state. In fact, it is the very opposite. A robust, questioning press is essential to a healthy democracy.Our work of holding power to account, investigating corruption, amplifying marginalised voices strengthens our nation. It does not weaken it,"" they added.The editors alleged that the organisation was being targeted precisely for its independent reporting. ""In an era when critical voices are increasingly scarce, we remain one of the few independent outlets willing to speak truth to power.""They further urged the authorities to withdraw the charges and end the ""harassment,"" appealing to civil society and media colleagues for support.Calling the allegations an intimidation tactic, they said, ""We call on the authorities to immediately cease this harassment, withdraw these unfounded allegations, and respect the constitutional guarantees of press freedom.""They also highlighted the newspaper’s long legacy since its founding in 1954 by Ved Bhasin, saying ""We have chronicled the region’s triumphs and failures with equal rigour. We have given voice to communities that would otherwise go unheard. We have asked difficult questions when others remained silent.""The editors noted that while the paper’s print edition was suspended in 2021–22 due to ""relentless targeting,"" Kashmir Times continues to operate digitally, with all content accessible on its website.Deputy chief minister Surinder Singh Choudhary, reacting to the raid, said action must be based on evidence and not pressure.""The agencies are doing their work. If a raid has to be conducted, it should not be done on a pick-and-choose basis.

God forbid that anyone gets caught up in a narrative; if someone gets trapped in this labyrinth, it becomes very difficult to get out

NEW DELHI: Former Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Friday delivered his first public speech since stepping down from office. Addressing a gathering in Bhopal, he highlighted the importance of fulfilling one’s duties and responsibilities, even in the face of personal constraints citing his recent past as proof.Speaking at the launch of Hum Aur Yeh Vishwa, a book by RSS joint general secretary Manmohan Vaidya, Dhankhar remarked, “In today's time, people are drifting away from morality and spirituality. 'Main flight pakadne ki chinta se apne kartavya ko nahin chhod sakta'. My recent past is proof of it…”Dhankhar also warned against getting caught in a narrative, saying that once you’re stuck, it becomes very difficult to get out, adding that ""I am not giving my example.""“‘Bhagwan kare ki koi narrative ke chakkar mein na fas jaye, iss chakravyuh mein koi fass gaya toh nikalna bada mushkil hain ()’. I am not giving my example,” he said.Both his remarks were met with laughter by the audience.Dhankhar resigned abruptly on July 21, citing health reasons, and had remained out of public view except for a quiet appearance at the swearing-in of his successor CP Radhakrishnan on September 12.His absence from public life had fuelled questions from the Opposition, which repeatedly argued he deserved a formal farewell like his predecessors. Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge alleged that Dhankhar was “forced out” because, after years of “harassing” the Opposition, he “suddenly decided to move by the book”. He claimed the government was angered when Dhankhar admitted notices to remove Justice Shekhar Yadav and Justice Yashwant Varma, saying the prime minister gave him a choice to “withdraw his order or face action”. Kharge argued that Dhankhar chose to resign, recalling how he had suspended a record number of MPs and remarking, “this is their democracy”. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut and Independent MP Kapil Sibal demanded clarity on Dhankhar’s whereabouts, with Sibal saying he had “never heard of a ‘laapataa vice president’”.Friday’s event was also notable for the absence of government representatives. No one from the Mohan Yadav administration or the state BJP arrived at the airport to receive him, prompting sharp criticism from former chief minister Digvijaya Singh.He accused the ruling party of disregarding protocol, saying the BJP values only those who are “useful” to it and describing its approach as “use and throw”. He added that he would not extend that criticism to the RSS, given Dhankhar had come at the Sangh’s invitation.Organisers said the former vice-president had been scheduled as the keynote speaker for some time, marking his first major engagement since leaving office. Dhankhar, who took charge in August 2022 and was due to serve until 2027, had an eventful tenure that included frequent clashes with the Opposition and an unprecedented impeachment motion that was later dismissed.","Jagdeep dhankhar spoke at the launch of a book by rss joint general secretary manmohan vaidya.

SRINAGAR: A judicial commission set up by the Union home ministry (MHA) to probe the Sept 24 violence in Leh warned Friday that anyone threatening eyewitnesses against deposing would be strictly dealt with.The commission, headed by retired Supreme Court judge BS Chauhan, had revealed last month that it was not getting good response and information on the violence that saw security forces in Leh allegedly open fire on protesters demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for the Union territory. Four people died and over 90 were injured.“There are several instances where people are being threatened and told not to depose. If anyone has been threatened, they should write to the commission. If someone is afraid to come forward, we will keep their identity confidential,” Rigzin Spalgon, joint secretary of the commission, said on Friday. He urged eyewitnesses to come forward and “speak freely” before the commission.Spalgon’s statements followed a notice on Thursday in which the commission warned of legal action against anyone “interfering, deterring, obstructing or hindering” witnesses.Evidence can be submitted till Nov 28, after which the commission will start hearings.The MHA had announced the commission after demands from Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), Ladakh’s two major political organisations. Both had made the panel’s formation a precondition for resuming dialogue with the Centre. Climate activist and LAB member Sonam Wangchuk was among the over 70 people arrested over the violence, which was followed by a clampdown that included curfew-like restrictions and internet blocks.Other than Chauhan, the commission has retired district judge Mohan Singh Parihar as judicial secretary and IAS Tushar Anand as administrative secretary. The ministry later expanded the panel by including Spalgon, a Ladakhi, on demands from LAB.After the probe commission was announced, the Centre resumed talks with LAB and KDA on Oct 22 in New Delhi.

Govt unveils tougher car safety test norms under BNCAP 2.0,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-unveils-tougher-car-safety-test-norms-under-bncap-2-0/articleshow/125491420.cms,"NEW DELHI: For car manufacturers, obtaining a five-star safety rating will become tougher under the next phase of Bharat NCAP, which will be rolled out from October 2027. Under BNCAP 2.0, cars will need to undergo five crash tests, compared with the current three. The new regime will add full frontal and rear crash tests to the existing offset (frontal), side, and side-pole impact tests.Cars will be evaluated on five broad parameters — safe driving, accident avoidance, crash protection, vulnerable road-user protection, and post-crash safety of occupants. This means vehicles equipped with advanced safety features such as autonomous emergency braking (AEB) and electronic stability control (ESC), which help reduce the chances of a crash, will receive higher ratings. The assessment will also factor in features such as drowsiness detection, lane-departure warning, and forward-collision alerts.The road transport ministry published the draft protocol for star ratings — Automotive Industry Standard (AIS) Code 197 — on Thursday and has invited feedback from stakeholders. “This will bring a paradigm shift in car-safety ratings and will be superior to many global standards. The main focus of NCAPs worldwide is to ensure that cars do not become death traps for occupants,” said a private-sector expert involved in preparing the new protocol.The first phase of BNCAP is valid until September 2027.The new assessment protocol will also evaluate female occupant safety, going beyond regulatory requirements, and the safety of belted minor occupants, specifically assessing 6- and 10-year-old children. It proposes the use of advanced crash-test dummies during side-impact and pole-impact tests for better analysis of occupant protection.The proposed standard also includes post-crash safety requirements for both conventional and electric vehicles, which are crucial for safe evacuation of occupants. These include mandatory assessments of energy management for fire and electrical hazards and occupant extrication. Optional assessments will include multi-collision braking (MCB), SOS or e-call systems, and hazard-warning light functions.The test protocol will also assess features aimed at minimising the impact on pedestrians and other vulnerable road users in the event of a crash.","Under bncap 2.0, cars will need to undergo five crash tests, compared with the current three.
