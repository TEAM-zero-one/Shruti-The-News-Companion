'Anti-party activities': Congress expels ex-Odisha MLA; Mouqim had written to Sonia Gandhi over party leadership,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/anti-party-activities-congress-expels-ex-odisha-mla-mouqim-had-written-to-sonia-gandhi-over-party-leadership/articleshow/125968775.cms,"What the letter said



Moquim’s past controversies



NEW DELHI: The Congress party on Monday expelled former MLA Mohammed Moquim from the party days after he wrote to Sonia Gandhi urging the removal of party president Mallikarjun Kharge on the grounds that “age is not on his side. ” Congress cited ""anti-party activities"" as the reason behind his expulsion, however, it refrained from specifying such acts.""This is for the information of all concerned that AICC has approved the proposal for the expulsion of Sri Md. Moquim from the primary membership of the party, due to anti-party activities,"" the notice issued by Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee (OPCC) said.Moquim had written to Sonia, urging her that the party should consider bringing forward ""young leaders"", adding that the Grand Old Party was going through a ""difficult phase"".""I have written a letter to Sonia Gandhi stating that the party is going through a difficult phase and needs her advice and new leadership... Age is not on AICC President Mallikarjun Kharge's side... We should bring forward young leaders. I know that Sonia ji and the CWC members will definitely discuss this.... Nuapada by-elections were concerning,"" he had said.The 60-year-old received criticism for the letter as OPCC chief Bhakta Das went on to equate his remarks as one aligned with the BJP.“Those who challenge the party leadership should immediately join the BJP,” he said on Sunday.Addressed to Sonia Gandhi, Moquim’s letter pointed out party’s recent electoral defeats in Bihar, Delhi, Haryana, Maharashtra and Kashmir and blamed a ""series of wrong decisions, misguided leadership choices"".""The recent outcomes in Bihar, Delhi, Haryana, Maharashtra, and Kashmir, where our defeats were by staggering margins, are not just electoral setbacks; they reflect a deeper organisational disconnect,"" the letter said.""A series of wrong decisions, misguided leadership choices, and the continued concentration of responsibility in the wrong hands have weakened the Party from within. Rather than correcting these errors, we appear to be repeating them and the consequences are now visible to the entire nation,"" the letter added.The letter further questioned whether the ""responsibilities being entrusted to the right people"".""Painful questions are being raised: Are decisions being made with seriousness? Are responsibilities being entrusted to the right people? Does the leadership fully grasp the gravity of this crisis, or are we allowing the Party's decline to continue unchecked, with decisions remaining in the wrong hands?"" he questioned.The Bharatiya Janata Party was quick to react to the ""internal rift"" with Shehzad Poonawalla saying, ""Team Priyanka vs team Rahul out in the open now Internal rift in Congress out! Senior Congress leader from Odisha Writes to Sonia Gandhi: Says Kharge Hatao ,Priyanka Lao;Hits out at state and central leadership Odisha leader Mohammed Moquim has questioned the leadership crisis nationally and called for deep structural, organisational and ideological renewal for the party’s revival. He notes a “deep and growing disconnect” between the Congress leadership and Indian youth, saying that under the current leadership of Mallikarjun Kharge, who is 83, the party has been unable to resonate with the youth.""This was not Moquim’s first brush with controversy. He was suspended on July 15, 2023, for questioning Pattanaik’s leadership, a decision that was later withdrawn on January 23, 2024, ahead of the simultaneous Assembly and Lok Sabha elections.Earlier, he had received a show-cause notice for cross-voting in support of NDA presidential candidate Droupadi Murmu in July 2022. The former Barabati–Cuttack MLA, who was elected for the first time and whose seat is now held by his daughter Sofia Firdous, was disqualified from contesting the 2024 elections after being convicted in a state vigilance case on September 29, 2022.","Congress cites ""anti-party activities"" as the reason behind his expulsion.

Bill proposes Rs 2 crore fine on illegal universities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bill-proposes-2cr-fine-on-illegal-univsities/articleshow/125968660.cms,"NEW DELHI: Any university or higher education institution established without approval of Central or state govt would face a penalty of at least Rs 2 crore and immediate closure, as per the new higher education bill — Viksit Bharat Adhishthan Bill — which is likely to be introduced in Lok Sabha on Monday.The bill circulated to MPs on Sunday evening also proposes that higher education institutions will be required to disclose financial details, audits, infrastructure, faculty information, courses, outcomes and accreditation status on a public portal maintained by the regulatory council as well as on their own websites. The disclosed data will form the basis for accreditation and regulatory oversight.TOI has learnt that govt is also likely to introduce a bill to replace the rural employment guarantee law, MGNREGA, on Monday. Sources said that though the Cabinet had last week approved the Pujya Bapu Gramin Rozgar Guarantee Bill, the acronym of the bill may be changed when it’s introduced in the House. The Bill proposes to guarantee 125 workdays per household as against 100 provided under the present law and would focus more on creating tangible assets in rural areas.As per the proposed Viksit Bharat Adhishthan Bill, there would be a common regulator for higher education, including universities, IITs and IIMs — Viksit Bharat Shiksha Viniyaman Parishad — having 14 members headed by a president.Its mandate would be to ensure coordination, maintenance of standards, and compliance with regulatory provisions across universities and higher educational institutions (HEIs).The regulatory council will promote a “light but tight” regulatory approach, emphasising transparency, accountability and autonomy. The bill proposes that all higher educational institutions would be required to achieve full accreditation in a graded manner, enabling them to become autonomous, multidisciplinary institutions offering high-quality education, research, vocational training and skilling programmes.The bill proposes to empower the regulatory council to take corrective action within 60 days in cases of misrepresentation, financial impropriety or administrative lapses. It proposes a robust grievance redressal mechanism for students and other stakeholders, ensuring fair and transparent handling of complaints.To enforce compliance, the bill proposes a graded penalty system. It says that for the first contravention of the Act or related rules, the regulatory council may issue a written notice seeking clarification and rectification. If the institution fails to fix the lapse within the specified period, it would face a penalty of at least Rs 10 lakh. In case of a repeated violation, the council would impose a penalty of at least Rs 30 lakh and may also recommend removal of officials concerned, review or downgrade the institution’s academic and administrative autonomy, or withhold govt grants until compliance is achieved.For persistent or continuing violations, the penalty would be at least Rs 75 lakh, and the institution may face suspension of degree-awarding powers, loss of affiliation or even closure, with such recommendations being placed in the public domain.","Viksit bharat adhishthan bill is likely to be introduced in lok sabha on monday.

SC: Employment on compassionate ground no ladder for promotion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-employment-on-compassionate-ground-no-ladder-for-promotion/articleshow/125966593.cms,"SC: Recruitment for other posts governed by rules applicable for all

New Delhi: In an important ruling, Supreme Court has said that a person employed on compassionate grounds to alleviate family difficulties because of death of a parent in harness cannot seek appointment to higher posts merely because they have the requisite qualifications for the same.A bench of Justices Rajesh Bindal and Manmohan on Friday reversed a Madras HC judgment directing Tami Nadu govt to promote two persons initially appointed as sweepers on compassionate grounds, due to death of their fathers, as Junior Assistants as they had the requisite qualifications for that post at the time of their appointment in 2007 and 2012. Both had approached the HC in 2015.The bench said employment is provided on compassionate grounds to the eligible kin of an employee who dies in harness to enable the family of the deceased to tide over difficult times. ""Such appointment which is arising out of exceptional circumstances cannot be used as a ladder to climb up in seniority by claiming a higher post merely on the basis that he/she is eligible for such post,"" it said. Justice Bindal said once the dependent of a deceased employee is offered employment on a compassionate basis, their right stands exercised. ""Thereafter, no question arises for seeking appointment to a higher post.Otherwise, it would be a case of 'endless compassion',"" he said.The bench said compassionate appointment is a relief against financial hardship caused by the sudden and unforeseen loss of the earning member of a family, and employment to the kin of the deceased is provided under such circumstances to ensure that the family members do not face impoverishment.The SC said recruitment for other posts are governed by rules and regulations which apply to all eligible candidates. Thus, it would be impermissible to allow a person who has entered employment through compassionate grounds to bypass the process of recruitment and get promoted to a higher post, it said.""An applicant for the post on a compassionate basis may be eligible for any higher post, but that does not mean he has the right to be appointed on that post. This depends on the rules and the policy applicable and also the number of vacancies to be offered in that category. In fact, this is not an additional source of recruitment, rather an exception to the general rule of providing equal opportunities to all for recruitment in government jobs,"" SC said.","Sc: recruitment for other posts governed by rules applicable for all eligible candidates.

New Delhi: The three-member inquiry committee headed by Supreme Court Judge Aravind Kumar has asked Justice Yashwant Varma, facing removal motion in the Lok Sabha in the aftermath of discovery of wads of burnt and unaccounted currency notes from his official residence, to respond to the memo of charges against him.In its Dec 5 proceedings, Justice Varma sought eight more weeks to respond to the charges of misconduct framed against him by the committee - comprising Justice Kumar, Madras HC Chief Justice M M Srivastava and senior advocate B V Acharya - that was constituted under the Judges (Inquiry) Act on Aug 12 by LS Speaker Om Birla pursuant to a removal motion signed by 146 MPs.The committee granted Justice Varma six more weeks to file a detailed response to the charges and said no further time would be granted to him for this purpose. The proceedings are scheduled to resume in the last week of Jan.The inquiry panel has supplied the memo of charges along with evidence, mainly comprising videos of the burning cash recorded by Delhi Police and Delhi Fire Service personnel on the night of March 14-15 while dousing a fire in a room inside the judge's Lutyens Zone bungalow and statements of witnesses recorded by the in-house inquiry conducted by another three-member panel set up by former CJI Sanjiv Khanna.During the proceedings before the inquiry panel, constituted by the LS speaker, Justice Varma will have the opportunity to counter the charges, produce witnesses in support of his innocence and can cross examine witnesses supporting the memo of charges against him. A week after the discovery of the cash on his residential premises, Justice Varma was transferred from Delhi HC to his parent HC at Allahabad. He has been stripped of judicial work since then.On March 22, then CJI Khanna set up a three-member in-house inquiry panel comprising Punjab and Haryana Chief Justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Chief Justice G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Justice Anu Sivaraman. This panel had submitted its report dated May 3 to the CJI on May 5.The in-house panel had rejected Justice Varma's defence that the cash had been planted to defame and discredit him, and said that it ""has no hesitation in holding that in the backdrop of direct as well as electronic evidence of unimpeachable character, further corroborated by the evidence of the experts, the issue of presence of cash in the storeroom situated within 30, Tughlaq Crescent, New Delhi, is established. "" It had recorded that the electronic evidence, mainly comprising videos and still photographs taken by the first responders, were found to be authentic by the Central Forensic Laboratory, Chandigarh.The panel's 64-page report had recorded that wads of half-burnt 500 currency notes in Justice Varma's official residence storeroom were cleaned up in the early hours of March 15 by ""trusted servants"" under the supervision of his private secretary after he talked on phone with the judge, who was out of station.","Unaccounted currency notes were recovered from official residence of justice yashwant varma.

NEW DELHI: With air quality worsening sharply across the Delhi-NCR, authorities on Saturday invoked the strictest restrictions under Stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan, triggering emergency curbs across the region. This comes hours after implementation of GRAP stage III measured in the national capital region.The Commission for Air Quality Management said its GRAP sub-committee had decided to enforce all measures under Stage IV or ‘Severe+’ air quality with immediate effect after pollution levels crossed critical thresholds. In an official statement, the panel said, “Keeping in view the prevailing trend of air quality and in an effort to prevent further deterioration of air quality in the region, the CAQM Sub-Committee on GRAP decides to invoke all actions as envisaged under Stage-IV of the extant GRAP ‘Severe+’ Air Quality (DELHI AQI > 450), with immediate effect, in the entire NCR. ” It added that these steps would be in addition to restrictions already in force under Stages I, II and III.In an official order, the government directed that all administrative secretaries and heads of departments shall attend office regularly, with no more than 50 per cent staff strength physically present.""The remaining 50 per cent staff shall work from home, provided that the Administrative Secretaries and Heads of Departments can call officers/officials to the office, as required to ensure uninterrupted delivery of essential and emergency public services,"" the order read.Likewise, the order stipulated that all private offices operating within Delhi shall function with no more than 50 per cent staff physically attending the workplace.""The remaining staff shall mandatorily work from home,"" it added. The order also urged all private entities to implement staggered working hours where feasible. Furthermore, private offices have been instructed to ensure strict compliance with work-from-home norms and minimise vehicular movement related to office commutes.""Hospitals and other public/private health establishments, Fire Services, Prisons, Public Transport, Electricity, Water, Sanitation and related municipal services, disaster management and related services, forest and environment departments/agencies engaged in air pollution control, monitoring, and enforcement activities (like teams deployed to curb biomass burning, dust control, GRAP measures, etc. ), and other essential/emergency services shall be exempted from these directions,"" the order said.The decision came hours after Delhi slipped back into the ‘severe’ category, prompting the reimposition of Stage III curbs earlier in the day. According to official data, the city’s Air Quality Index, which stood at 349 on Friday evening, surged overnight and was recorded at 401 by Saturday morning due to slow wind speeds, a stable atmosphere and unfavourable meteorological conditions that hampered the dispersion of pollutants.According to news agency ANI, As of 7.00 PM, AQI readings were 488 in Anand Vihar, 434 in Ashok Vihar, 496 in Bawana, 457 in Burari, 479 in Chandini Chowk, 394 in IGI Airport, and 445 in Okhla Phase-2.Also read: Delhi AQI turns 'severe': GRAP Stage III reimposed across NCR; what's allowed & what's not A dense layer of smog enveloped the capital on Saturday morning, reducing visibility and intensifying health concerns. Wazirpur recorded the worst air quality with an AQI of 445, followed by Vivek Vihar at 444, Jahangirpuri at 442 and Anand Vihar at 439. Several other areas, including Rohini, Ashok Vihar, Narela, Mundka and Bawana, also remained in the ‘severe’ range.Poor air quality conditions extended beyond Delhi, with parts of Uttar Pradesh also reporting dense smog. Noida sectors recorded AQI levels of 448, while visibility dropped in cities such as Bulandshahr, Ayodhya and Mainpuri amid fog and haze.Under CPCB norms, an AQI between 401 and 500 is classified as ‘severe’ and poses serious health risks, particularly for children, the elderly and those with respiratory ailments.

He told cops that he wanted to kill the priest, Mahesh Sharma, as the latter harboured ""malicious intent"" towards his family.Sharma, who was away at the time of the murder, rubbished the claim, adding that he had received death threats around two weeks ago.His family said that a long-drawn property dispute over the temple might have been the motive behind the attack. A police officer said the dispute has been pending in court for several years. Cops sought a response from the Authority regarding the ownership status of the temple.Sharma, a resident of Ramnagar in Mansarovar Park, told police that he informed his wife, Kusum (48) at 11.30 am that he was going to perform a puja at the house of a resident of the society. ""I told her to come along, and she said that she would join me in a few minutes.""Ten minutes later, I received a phone call from a man who was painting the temple.He told me that my wife had been attacked with a chopper. She was struck on the head and other parts of the body,"" Sharma said.Kusum was rushed to the nearby GTB Hospital, but had died by then.According to Sharma, three to four people were present inside the temple when the man approached a woman and asked about Sharma's whereabouts. When she told him that Sharma was away, the man asked where Kusum was. As soon as the woman pointed towards her, the man pounced on Kusum. ""The woman picked up a stick and tried to stop him, but she was also attacked and sustained injuries. She received stitches on her head,"" Sharma said.Deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) Prashant Priya Gautam said that the man, who is being questioned, was detained along with the weapon of murder.A case was registered under Section 103 (murder) of BNS.

Youth with experience



The Chhattisgarh test



East in Focus



A Familiar transition tool



The Bharatiya Janata Party has once again sprung a surprise. In a significant organisational move, the BJP parliamentary board has appointed Bihar minister and five-time MLA Nitin Nabin as the party’s Working National President, making him the youngest leader to occupy the post in the party’s history.The elevation underlines the BJP’s reliance on quiet strategists as it recalibrates its national political and organisational strategy. The importance of the move underlined by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who described Nitin Nabin as a hardworking karyakarta with strong organisational roots.At 45, Nitin Nabin represents the BJP’s younger leadership tier, but his political career has been built on experience rather than speed. A five-time MLA, he has served multiple terms as a minister in the Bihar government, combining administrative responsibility with sustained organisational engagement.Within the party, Nabin is known more as an organisation man than a mass leader. His long association with the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha and his exposure to booth-level mobilisation and cadre management align closely with the BJP’s election-winning model.During Anurag Thakur’s tenure as BJYM national president, Nabin served as a general secretary, handling inter-state coordination and campaign execution — a phase that gave him early exposure to national-level organisation.Nabin’s organisational credentials were reinforced during the 2023 Chhattisgarh Assembly elections. At a time when most exit polls were predicting a BJP loss and the return of a Congress government under Bhupesh Baghel, the party delivered a decisive victory.As the BJP’s in-charge for the state, Nabin worked largely behind the scenes, focusing on micro-planning, candidate coordination and organisational discipline. The result confounded pollsters and strengthened his reputation within the party as a quiet but effective election manager.The elevation of a leader from Bihar is also politically significant. Bihar remains central to the BJP’s medium and long-term electoral strategy. By bringing a leader from the state into the national organisational leadership, the party is signalling a sharper focus on eastern India.Nitin Nabin’s rise also sends a clear message to party workers- organisational work and loyalty continue to matter.The BJP has used the working president model earlier during leadership transitions. In 2019, J P Nadda was appointed working president when Amit Shah was party president and later inducted into the Union cabinet as home minister.Seen in that context, Nitin Nabin is viewed within the party as a reliable, non-controversial choice, focused on execution rather than factional politics.",Bihar minister and five-time mla nitin nabin has been appointed as the party’s working national president. He is the youngest leader to occupy the post in the party's history.

What is Pink Tax ?



It may sound like a trivial question, but the answer points to a deeper issue: the Pink Tax

.

The Pink Tax shows up across everyday life:

Personal care products:

Fashion and accessories:

Cosmetic procedures:

Healthcare

:

How marketing makes femininity costlier



The safety tax: Paying to feel safe



Housing: Where safety overrides affordability



The unpaid labour tax



Healthcare and fertility pressure



The pay gap makes the burden heavier



The ‘career loss’ tax



Does simply existing as a woman cost more?



Does society acknowledge how expensive womanhood is?



I don’t think society fully acknowledges how expensive womanhood is because many of these costs are normalised and invisible. They’re framed as ‘choices’, not necessities. Until we recognise these expenses as structural rather than personal, women will continue to bear them quietly, without much conversation. Priyanka Mukherjee

Is safety treated as a luxury rather than a right?



The bill may be invisible, but it’s paid daily.

What is luxury?For a woman, simply being able to take a walk at night is often considered a luxury. But this freedom isn't free. It comes at a cost most people never see, the extra money, effort and emotional labour women pay every day just to exist.Every rupee women spend is backed by labour, yet when it comes to buying everyday essentials, its value seems to shrink. Every morning, as I get ready for office, I inevitably spend more than a man would and not because I am extravagant, but because of the hidden taxes I pay every time I buy something.Why? Because a moisturiser packaged in lavender tones, promising ""smooth skin"" , costs more than a man’s basic black bottle offering the same function. When I calculated my spending on personal care, clothing, services and daily necessities, the pattern became impossible to ignore.How? Because women consistently pay more year after year simply because products are marketed to them. And no, this isn’t just a Western problem. India isn’t exempt.It is not a government levy or an official surcharge. Instead, it is the invisible premium women pay for products and services marketed ""for women"" , even when they are nearly identical to men’s versions.Simply put, it’s the cost of being a woman. Many everyday products aimed at women are priced higher than their male counterparts despite serving the same purpose.""I think most people have little idea of the extra costs a woman has to bear simply to exist. There is a concept of ‘Pink Tax’ that few men are aware of, as it mainly involves women’s personal care products. Beyond the monetary aspect, there is also a safety angle to all this,"" said Aashish Saxena.That’s the Pink Tax — and that’s why a pink razor costs more than a man’s black one.Women’s shampoos, conditioners and moisturisers routinely cost more than men’s, even when the difference is limited to packaging or colour.Women’s formalwear and accessories are often priced higher despite similar materials and construction. The markup is usually explained away as ""fashion"" or ""finishing"" .Aggressively marketed to women, adding to the financial burden.Gynaecological check-ups, fertility consultations and reproductive healthcare come with higher recurring costs.""If you book a full comprehensive check-up for men on the health/medical app, it costs Rs 4,999, but for women, it costs Rs 5,999,"" said Pallavi, pointing to the hidden cost.Women are often seen as less price-sensitive when it comes to personal care, not because they want to be, but because many of these products are framed as necessities. Companies exploit this shift. What was once optional is now presented as baseline: SPF, retinol, serums, AM/PM routines, laser treatments, Botox, hair removal, marketed as ""permanent"" solutions that never truly end.""If we look at the market, the range of products available for women the variants and the overall maintenance and is far wider compared to men. The skincare industry largely targets women, giving men limited space under the idea of toughness,"" said Vijaya Srivastava.Pallavi also points to fashion as another quiet contributor to the hidden tax. ""Why can’t I have jeans with normal-sized pockets that can fit today’s phones?"" she asks.""Men can just slip their phones into their pockets and walk freely. Why do we have to carry a handbag just to hold a phone? Because we don’t have pockets."" Her frustration reflects how design choices, driven by fashion norms and commercial interests, create yet another invisible cost: one paid in convenience, money and everyday freedom.Beyond products, women quietly absorb another cost, the safety tax! In urban India, women often pay a premium simply to move through the city. Public transport that is cheaper for men is not always an option. Cabs, safer buses or higher travel classes become necessities, not luxuries.Ignoring buses, trains and shared autos ""just to feel safe"" is common and expensive. ""While men don’t have to think twice about getting into a crowded metro or bus, a woman might opt for a far more expensive cab just to avoid harassment,"" said Aashish.Aastha Jha explains the cost she absorbs every month. ""I pay Rs 6,000 for travel to office every month. I haven’t used shared autos, buses or the metro enough to even compare. My area is quite secluded with poor connectivity, so sharing doesn’t feel safe.""She adds that this expense isn’t consciously planned. ""I don’t budget for it deliberately, but I’ve been doing it subconsciously for years.""While men may think about safety during odd hours, Aastha notes the difference during the day. ""Men my age think about safety late at night. During normal hours, they don’t have to factor it in.""For women, even basic freedoms come with anxiety. ""Being able to take a walk at night feels like a luxury. Whether you live in a gated society or a secluded area, you never really know who could harm you.""Her colleague Vivek Dubey agrees. ""Safety matters to everyone, but not in the same way. I can book a cab at midnight without much thought. My main concern is the driver’s driving, not my personal safety.""He admits this is a privilege men often overlook. ""I can take a bike taxi because it’s cheaper. I wouldn’t recommend the same to my female friends because of harassment risks.""Safety also dictates where women live.""When I came to New Delhi, my priorities were safety and security,"" recalls Jyoti, a college student. ""I looked at high-rise societies with rents far above my budget, but I had no choice,"" she said.Natasha Singh adds, ""Safety plays a huge role in evaluating cost of living."" After a robbery at her home, she and her flatmate were more concerned about security than stolen items. ""When my flatmate was not in town, I used to travel all the way from Noida to Gurgaon to live with my parents because I didn’t feel safe living alone.""Women also bear the burden of unpaid domestic and emotional labour: cooking, cleaning, caregiving and emotional management, the work that doesn’t show up in GDP calculations.Menstrual products are unavoidable expenses men do not face. Beyond that, women incur ongoing costs linked to reproductive health, PCOS, fertility testing, supplements and preventive check-ups.""Women experience more frequent health milestones and transitions, which leads to higher spending on routine medical care and supplements — costs that are rarely framed as healthcare burdens,"" said Priyanka Mukherjee.""The biggest hidden tax that I pay, I think, is healthcare tax. Firstly, female health is the least talked about. And because of that, even the most basic tests cost thousands. And I am just talking about tests, have not even started on medication, consultation,"" said Aastha.Period poverty adds another layer. Despite GST removal on sanitary pads in 2018, one in ten girls under 21 in rural areas still cannot afford menstrual products.Women earn less but pay more.In India, women earn approximately Rs 40 for every Rs 100 earned by men. The country ranks 131 out of 148 in the Global Gender Gap Report 2025.""Yes, I do believe women are often paid less than male colleagues with similar experience or output, though the gap is not always obvious on paper. It shows up in slower growth, fewer leadership opportunities, or being expected to ""prove"" consistency over time,"" said Priyanka reflecting on the disparity that only makes the burden of the Pink Tax feel heavier.Vijaya highlighted what she sees as one of the biggest hidden taxes women pay at work. ""I’ve had colleagues with the same or even less work experience earn a higher CTC than me. I’ve also seen my female colleagues having to switch jobs more frequently than men simply because companies don’t make retention offers to them,"" she said.""Men, on the other hand, are often retained. There’s never been an official declaration, but the pattern is quite evident. Having to repeatedly adjust to new environments is another hidden tax I’ve noticed,"" she added.The Pink Tax doesn’t just hurt wallets — it reinforces inequality!Safety concerns also push many women out of high-paying night shifts or demanding roles altogether. A budding journalist, Oshin, said she considered quitting because late working hours didn’t feel feasible for her.Living far from work, she didn’t want to take on the additional financial and emotional burden of arranging safety every night.Smriti Jain believes it does. ""Simply being a woman comes with higher, unavoidable expenses. While awareness is growing, the true economic impact is still not fully acknowledged,"" she said.Natasha echoed the sentiment, saying, ""From daily transport to monthly periods, our lives are forced to be comparatively more expensive. Whether it is shopping for toiletries or simply getting a haircut, everything is more costly, marketed as a better lifestyle choice.""Priyanka, speaking candidly, agreed. ""Honestly, yes. Simply existing as a woman costs more — financially, emotionally and mentally. From safety planning and health spending to clothing choices shaped by social scrutiny, there are constant micro-costs attached to being cautious, prepared and presentable,"" she said.She added that one of the biggest hidden taxes rarely discussed is mental bandwidth. ""The cost of constantly thinking ahead. ‘Is this safe?’ ‘Should I stay late?’ ‘Do I need a cab?’ ‘Will this be misread?’ That constant vigilance has an economic value we never calculate.""""For many women, safety often feels like something you have to plan and pay for, rather than something that simply exists,"" she added.Vivek acknowledged the disparity. ""Yes, I do think simply existing as a woman costs more, financially, mentally and emotionally. But I don’t think society truly acknowledges it. There’s a kind of collective blindness around this issue. It’s almost as if society has accepted that it’s expensive to be a woman and decided this is just how things are,"" he said.Rajeev Singh another male colleague of Vivek also agreed. ""Men generally have greater flexibility to compromise on comfort or safety. Social norms, lower levels of harassment and fewer restrictions on movement allow men to accept risks that would be unreasonable or dangerous for women. Womanhood does appear costly — even if you subtract safety-related expenses,"" he said.Aastha believes the issue is deeply structural. ""Absolutely. Society itself has made womanhood expensive by keeping research and technological development that could genuinely benefit women scarce,"" she said.""An HPV vaccine that could prevent cervical cancer costs thousands. These are exactly the areas that should be mass-produced, considering women make up nearly half the country’s population,"" she added.Priyanka, however, feels the burden remains largely invisible.Natasha believes it is. ""It's a known fact that women feel more restricted even if it’s self-imposed, after a safety incident occurs in their vicinity. When a DU student was harassed outside a girls’ college, the response was to put up posters listing ‘dos and don’ts’ for women. That tells you everything. Our safety is treated like a joke, not a basic right,"" she said.Vivek added that meaningful change requires structural effort.""Real change would require going back to the basics, changing policies, enforcing laws, redesigning public spaces, and challenging everyday behaviour. That takes effort and intent. And perhaps that’s why the issue is often ignored, even though it affects the dignity and daily lives of nearly half the population,"" he said.Taken together, these everyday choices where women live, how they travel, the work they take on and the risks they avoid rarely show up as line items in budgets or policy discussions.Yet they quietly shape women’s freedom, mobility and opportunities in ways that are easy to overlook but hard to escape.","The pink tax is the invisible premium women pay for products and services marketed ""for women"" products aimed at women are priced higher than their male counterparts despite serving the same purpose. Women are often seen as less price-sensitive when it comes to personal care.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125962672,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-12650,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Who owns the hill?



When devotees moved to court for sacred lamp

When the debate reached Parliament



The three axes of the conflict

Judicial authority and constitutional limits

State discretion in preventing potential unrest

Devotee autonomy in ritual practice

Rising at the edge of Madurai, Thiruparankundram in Tamil Nadu 's Madurai has served as sanctuary, landmark, battlefield, shrine and memory for centuries. First to Jain monks who chiselled beds into its stone nearly 2,300 years ago, later to poets of the Sangam age who immortalised it as Murugan Kundram, and eventually to monarchs, pilgrims and mendicants who left inscriptions and belief layered into its slopes.Across centuries, the hill took on meanings that were never singular. It became a sacred space for Murugan devotees, a site associated with the god’s divine wedding, a spiritual retreat that bore Jain inscriptions in early Tamil script, and by the 14th century, a place of significance for followers of Sikandar Shah, whose memorial evolved into the Sikander Badusha Dargah. As rituals shifted and dynasties changed, Thiruparankundram continued to absorb new customs into its landscape.For generations of residents, the hill's story was not interpreted through boundaries or separations, but through the shared steps people climbed and the shared festivals they observed.Today, that long history forms the backdrop against which new questions are being posed about space, symbolism and tradition. A debate that has become a flashpoint between devotees in courtrooms and a stage for fresh DMK vs BJP.Thiruparankundram occupies a singular place in Tamil Nadu's cultural and religious landscape. Recognised as one of the Arupadai Veedu, the six sacred abodes of Lord Murugan, it is revered as the site associated with the divine wedding of Murugan and Deivanai, a narrative deeply embedded in Tamil devotional literature and temple ritual.References to the hill appear in Sangam-era texts such as 'Akananuru' and 'Thirumurugatrupadai', indicating that its sanctity has been acknowledged for well over two millennia. Archaeological evidence traces the hill's significance even further back: around 2,300 years ago, Jain monks carved stone beds with Tamizhi-era inscriptions along its slopes, marking it as a place of spiritual retreat long before the temple infrastructure seen today.By the sixth century, the site appears in the 'Tevaram' hymns as 'Parankundram' and over time it evolved into a complex centre of worship. In the eighth century, Pandya ruler Parantaka Varagu and General Santhan Ganapathy commissioned a rock-cut temple dedicated to Soma Skanda, depicting Shiva, Parvati and Murugan together.The temple houses shrines for Vishnu , Vinayaka, Durga, Jyeshta Devi and others, representing the Panchayatana tradition of multiple deities within a single sacred complex.Inscriptions from the period, including one from 773 CE referencing the worship of Jyeshta Devi, showcase a layered ritual ecosystem that adapted and expanded with dynastic rule and regional belief.The history of the hill took another turn in the 14th century.During the Madurai Sultanate, following the invasion led by Alauddin Khilji's general Malik Kafur, the region came under the rule of ten Muslim sultans. The last among them, Sikandar Shah, is believed to have sought refuge in the hills before being killed. A memorial to him eventually transformed into the Sikkander Badusha Dargah, developing into a site of devotion where followers regarded him as a Sufi saint.According to researchers and local oral histories, including interpretations cited by the Thiruparankundram Jamath, a Pandya ruler is said to have sanctioned a prayer site out of repentance, a narrative symbolising reconciliation rather than conflict.Over centuries, religious practices have evolved on this hill through shared participation.One such tradition is 'kandoori', a practice involving offering and sharing of meat as thanksgiving, described by the Jamath as conceptually similar to nerthi kadan in Hindu customs where vows are fulfilled through food or offerings. Members of the Muslim community note that Hindus have historically participated in kandoori rituals, while Muslims join in temple festivals, tonsuring infants’ heads and celebrating street processions.Local residents often describe the hill's identity not through the lens of division but through shared spaces and shared customs. C Santhalingam, a former officer of the Tamil Nadu archaeology department told TOI that Thiruparankundram is ""among the most unique as it is a place where histories and faiths intersect."" He emphasises that the hill ""has never belonged to one community,"" pointing out not only the temple and the dargah but also the Jain beds with inscriptions, evidence of its long and diverse spiritual heritage.However, Santhalingam and others note that in recent months, debates surrounding religious practice have begun overshadowing this legacy of coexistence. A disagreement over a signboard referring to facilities for kandoori rituals triggered a fresh set of tensions in February this year, leading to protests, petitions and involvement from political stakeholders.""Kandoori is not an orthodox Muslim practice,"" M Arif, secretary of Thiruparankundram Jamath told TOI in February. ""It is closer to gurbani, where meat is shared after an animal is butchered. In kandoori, a person makes a wish, cooks food, and shares it, which is like the Hindu practice of nerthi kadan (offering food or some valuables as a vow).""Jamath member A Abudahir said even Hindus in the area followed kandoori and offered prayers at dargahs. ""We are not outsiders. We are Tamil Nadu's people. It's just that we have some unique customs. Even today, we tonsure our newborns' heads like they do in Hindu rituals before we offer kandoori at the hilltop dargah,"" he said.Sathya Seelan, a third-generation hairdresser, said that for generations, his family has been tonsuring the heads of those who participate in the kandoori ritual. ""A decade ago, some people earned money by carrying goats and cooking materials up the hill for this ritual,"" he said. During the annual Santhakoodu festival, much like a temple car festival, a decorated dome placed on a cart is drawn through streets, said Abudahir. ""People apply sandalwood paste to the dome in memory of Sikandar Shah. All Hindus participate and we have never had any issue. We also enjoy the temple car festival.""The dispute over lighting the Karthigai deepam is seen by many locals as part of a broader shift, where questions of space, symbolism and historical rights have become increasingly contested.For much of its past, the hill held room for many traditions at once, and its rituals adjusted to the rhythms of diverse communities. The current debates, both legal and political, revisit unresolved questions from earlier decades, but they also reflect contemporary anxieties over identity, culture and authority. As many long-time residents reiterate, conflict is not the oldest story of Thiruparankundram; coexistence is.Today, this hill is the focus point of DMK vs BJP in Tamil Nadu. The issue has echoed from Parliament o Supreme Court.However, legal disputes around ownership and ritual usage of the hill began in the early 20th century, long before the current political and administrative controversy surrounding the Karthigai deepam ritual.In the 1920s, both the temple administration and the dargah trustees approached the courts seeking recognition over sections of the hill. The case travelled through the colonial judiciary, and the Privy Council eventually upheld the temple’s ownership of the hill. It also recognised a small but significant portion of land to the dargah.Although the judgment settled ownership, it did not address ritual traditions or determine exclusive religious rights at various points on the hill. That space later became ground for differing interpretations.For decades following this verdict, the Karthigai deepam festival proceeded without becoming a symbol of territorial claim. The lamp was lit at the Uchipillaiyar temple mandapam, a practice widely recognised and rarely challenged. The serenity broke only in the 1990s, when the first petition asked that deepam be shifted upward to Deepathoon.In 1994, a devotee approached the Madras high court demanding the lamp be lit at the hilltop pillar instead of the Uchipillaiyar mandapam.In 1996, the court responded by affirming the mandapam as the ""traditional spot"". This was the first time the spot for lighting the flame was confirmed, keeping it at a safe distance from the dargah.It was an order rooted in practicality but written with ambiguity. It left the door open for a possible change in the future.Almost two decades later in 2014, another petition revived the same demand. The court rejected the plea again, asserting that devotees cannot enforce ritual preferences in court and that judges must not intervene in spiritual practices unless administrative failures are proven.In 2017, a division bench upheld that reasoning. Temple management, the court reiterated, retains autonomy over rituals, locations and modalities. These pronouncements seemed settled law. But the Karthigai deepam debate is yet far from its final chapter.In 2024, Hindu Tamilar Katchi founder Rama Ravikumar filed a fresh petition. His argument rested on three pillars:On December 1, Justice GR Swaminathan agreed with the petitioner and directed that the lamp be lit at the hilltop pillar. When the order was not implemented on the festival day, the judge concluded that the breach was clear and he permitted the petitioner and ten others to light the lamp themselves, with Central Industrial Security Force protection.However, the administration blocked the access to the hill citing prohibitory orders, a pending appeal, safety concerns and the need to maintain communal harmony. The police prevented even personnel of a central security force from proceeding, and the unlit deepam became a headline.What could have been a closed legal loop immediately expanded into a political spiral.Dispute over deepam ritual matter because they turn abstract ideology, Dravidian vs Hindutva, into a tangible battle over who speaks for Tamil Hindus, on temple steps and hilltops both parties cannot afford to lose.The symbolism is powerful: a flame, a hill, a shared sacred space. The BJP sees opportunity; the DMK sees risk.DMK has alleged that BJP is trying to use the deepam issue to create an Ayodhya-like situation (Babri masjid) in Tirupparankundram.Tamil Nadu BJP president Nainar Nagendran accused the Stalin government of indulging in vote-bank politics, claiming there was no Muslim opposition to the ritual and framing the controversy as a ""manufactured hurdle"". He has also retorted that ""Ayodhya is in India, not in England or Europe. There is nothing wrong in Tirupparankundram becoming Ayodhya. We have heard the greatness of Ram Rajya and want to implement it here. ""BJP MP Tejasvi Surya escalated the rhetoric by calling the DMK administration ""undemocratic and fascist"" for failing to enforce a judicial order. Union Minister L Murugan added that the state was ""denying the right to worship"" and acting in contempt of the law.The VHP called the situation an ""attack on constitutional rights of Hindus"", urging central intervention and judicial cognisance.The DMK government countered with a narrative rooted in continuity and caution. Chief minister MK Stalin said the deepam was lit ""at the right place at the right time"" according to age-old practice, and argued that those insisting on the hilltop location were attempting to turn a spiritual tradition into a divisive exercise.He described such efforts as ""cheap politics of the worst kind"" and reassured that Tamil Nadu remained a place where people of all religions lived ""like relatives"", protected by the light of equality lit by Periyar’s reformist ideals.The Left parties alleged that there were attempts to whip up communal tensions in Tamil Nadu by manufacturing a controversy around the religious sites. In a joint statement, the CPI(M), CPI, CPI(ML), RSP, and AIFB condemned the targeting of Madurai MP Su Venkatesan over the issue.""The Left parties strongly condemn the attempts by the BJP and other Hindutva communal forces to whip up communal tensions in Tamil Nadu by manufacturing a controversy around the religious sites situated on Tirupparankundram Hill in Madurai district, with a sinister eye on political gain,"" the statement read.The AIADMK meanwhile passed resolutions condemning interference in the judiciary and sought projection of its leader as a future chief minister. While its criticism converged with BJP’s, its rhetoric positioned itself as a defender of judicial independence rather than explicitly labeling the issue as anti-Hindu.As DMK MPs protested in Parliament this week during Winter session demanding the issue be raised, the Lok Sabha was adjourned. When remarks were made against the judge behind the order, reactions from ministers were swift, reminding members that criticism of the judiciary crosses constitutional boundaries. Outside the courts, the Madras high court division bench warned against demoralising the institution and cautioned that the judiciary’s patience must not be tested.At the same time, the INDIA bloc initiated steps for impeachment of Justice Swaminathan, alleging judicial overreach and potential disturbance to communal harmony. Impeachment motions against judges are rare, politically consequential and historically treated as measures of last resort.The Karthigai deepam row cannot be read purely as a religious issue. Three themes intersect at the hill:Meanwhile, the question of coexistence, an unwritten social contract honoured for centuries, hangs in the background.","Thiruparankundram in tamil nadu's madurai has served as sanctuary, landmark, battlefield, shrine and memory for centuries. It is revered as the site associated with the divine wedding of murugan and deivanai, a narrative deeply embedded in tamil devotional literature and temple ritual.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125959462,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1337222,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Veteran Congress leader Shamanuru Shivashankarappa passed away at a private hospital in Davanagere on Sunday due to age-related ailments, family members and officials said. He was 95.A six-time MLA who represented the Davanagere South Assembly constituency, Shivashankarappa had been undergoing treatment for some time. He was the senior-most legislator in Karnataka and among the most senior lawmakers in the country, according to sources.“He was admitted to hospital on October 23. Age-related issues were there. He was fine and comfortable and the situation continued till the end. Unfortunately, at 6.20 PM, Shamanuru Shivashankarappa passed away,” Dr Sharan Patil of Sparsh Hospital, who is also a family member, told reporters.Shivashankarappa is survived by three sons, including Karnataka Minister for Mines and Geology and Horticulture S S Mallikarjun, and four daughters. His daughter-in-law, Prabha Mallikarjun, is the Member of Parliament from Davanagere.A former minister, Shivashankarappa served as treasurer of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) for several decades and was also president of the All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha, the apex body of the influential Veerashaiva-Lingayat community.Known for his forthright views, he worked to unify the community amid internal differences and did not hesitate to speak against his own party government on issues related to it.Apart from his political career, Shivashankarappa was a noted educationist who founded several educational institutions and was also an industrialist. He had earlier served as a minister and was once elected as a Member of Parliament.Chief minister Siddaramaiah expressed grief over his death, saying, “The society has been left poorer by the loss of a politician who, during his long public life, stayed away from accusations and allegations and devoted his power to the welfare of the people.” He added that Shivashankarappa’s role in making Davanagere district a model district would keep his memory alive among the people.Deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar said Shivashankarappa, who dedicated his life to social service, made a significant contribution to the field of education. “His departure has caused an irreparable loss to the country and the Congress Party,” he said in a post on X.AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge recalled his long association with Shivashankarappa and his family since 1972. “I pray to the Almighty to give strength to Shivashankarappa's family to bear the loss,” he said in a video message, adding that he would visit Karnataka to take part in the last rites.Former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda also expressed grief, recalling his long association with the veteran leader. “His simplicity and his long service to the people in public life will always be remembered.

‘Didn’t Go For Son’s Operation’: Kharge Lauds Rahul Gandhi In ‘Vote Chori’ Rally, Calls BJP ‘Gaddar’

NEW DELHI: As the Congress held a mega rally protesting the nationwide special intensive revision (SIR) and ""vote-chori"", party president Mallikarjun Kharge on Sunday said he skipped his son’s operation in Bengaluru to attend the rally at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan. He called it more important “to save 140 crore people.”""Didn't go for son's operation to Bengaluru, came here as I have to save 140 crore people,"" said Kharge while addressing the gathering.Kharge also launched a scathing attack on the BJP , accusing those involved in “vote chori” of being “gaddars” who need to be removed from power to protect the voting rights and the Constitution. “The BJP people are 'gaddars' (traitors) and 'dramebaaz' (indulge in theatrics). They need to be removed from power,” he said.Alleging that the ideology of the Manusmriti, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and the BJP will “destroy the nation,” Kharge claimed that only Congress’s ideology can safeguard India’s Constitution. “Only Congress party's ideology can save the nation; ideology of (Mohan) Bhagwat, (Madhav Rao) Gowalkar Guruji, or the Manusmriti will not save the nation, but destroy it.The path the BJP, PM Modi is going, slowly and steadily, they are trying to finish the Constitution,” he said.Kharge praised Rahul Gandhi for leading the fight to “save the country” and urged citizens to strengthen Congress’s ideology. “Rahul Gandhi is fighting for the country, and to strengthen that fight is the responsibility of us all, that is what I want to request you all. If you do strengthen those ideas then it is your loss, the country's loss, not his loss. If you want to save the country, if you want to save your vote, protect it, if you want to save the Constitution, then you can work for yourself. The work of bringing forward our ideology, ideas, is being done by Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, today Priyanka is also doing,” he said.Kharge also accused the BJP of trying to “enslave people under the guise of Hinduism.” “Everyone is there under the Hindu religion, but under the guise of Hinduism, they want to enslave people. If you want to be a slave, if you give up your self-respect, then you will be finished. The freedom we got (from the Britishers) was given by Congress. Did Modi give it? Modi was not even born then. Amit Shah was just a kid then. These people talk against Nehru, Gandhi, and Ambedkar,” he said.He added, “They want to pretend that Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel were fighting, and on the other hand, they do vote chori. These are traitors; you have to remove these traitors. If you want to protect your rights and become stronger, remove these traitors. On that issue too, Rahul Gandhi walked 800 kilometres.”The rally comes amid heightened political activity surrounding Congress’s campaign against alleged electoral irregularities, including “vote chori” and the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) issue. Party leaders, including Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, also addressed the gathering, with Priyanka accusing the BJP of avoiding real issues such as inflation and pollution, choosing instead to debate the origins of the song Vande Mataram.","Mallikarjun kharge said he skipped his son's operation to attend the rally.

Bihar Minister Nitin Nabin Appointed National Working President Of BJP

New Delhi: As far as dark horses go, Nitin Nabin 's elevation in the BJP organisation was as big a surprise as they come.

The generous praise heaped on him by its brass, led by PM Narendra Modi, made it all but certain.Nabin's rise bears an unmistakable imprint of Modi, who is known for his out-of-box approach on weighty issues of governance and politics, and Amit Shah , and marks another generational change at the apex of BJP's organisation, which underwent its first round of transformation after Modi's elevation as the party's mascot in 2013, with Shah in 2014 and Nadda in 2020 being entrusted with the organisational leadership.Modi praised him on X, saying, ""Nitin Nabin has made his distinct identity as a dedicated worker.

New Delhi: Delhiites could see poison in the air on Sunday. A thick layer of toxic smog enveloped the capital, turning the city into a gas chamber with air quality plunging to ‘severe-plus’ category for the first time this year.The city’s 24-hour average air quality index stood at 461, the second-worst recorded in Dec and the worst in nearly 13 months. Since the scale began in April 2015, only once has a higher AQI been recorded in Dec — 469 on Dec 21, 2017. For any month, the last time Delhiites a suffered worst AQI was on Nov 18 last year (494).High moisture, low temperatures and calm winds effectively trapped pollution close to the surface even as a grey smog screened out the sun for most of the day. Winds are predicted to pick up slightly post-noon on Monday, which could disperse some pollutants.","The city’s 24-hour average air quality index stood at 461, the second-worst recorded in dec and the worst in nearly 13 months.

"State introduces ‘Vision 2047’, setting ambitious goals for growth & progress",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/state-introduces-vision-2047-setting-ambitious-goals-for-growth-progress/articleshow/125963238.cms,"Raipur: Chief minister Vishnu Deo Sai on Sunday unveiled ""Anjor Vision 2047"" in the Assembly — an ambitious, people-centric blueprint aimed at transforming the state into a fully developed region by the time India celebrates 100 years of Independence.Calling the moment historic, the CM said the vision document lays out a clear, mission-driven roadmap with phased goals, governance reforms, and a strong push for infrastructure, investment, jobs and social development.Recalling that Chhattisgarh's first Assembly session was held on Dec 14, 2000, at Rajkumar College soon after the state was formed, Sai said the new Assembly building marks the start of a fresh development journey. Reflecting the state's culture and democratic values, the building, he said, would stand as a symbol of both heritage and progress.Using an analogy from Jashpur's archery tradition and the Mahabharata, Sai said Chhattisgarh now has a single-minded focus. ""Like Arjuna's eye on the bird, our target is a developed Chhattisgarh,"" he said, adding that the state has a clear and achievable plan to reach that goal.Work on the vision document began soon after the government took office, Sai said.It was prepared through wide public participation, involving farmers, youth, women, entrepreneurs and other stakeholders. Describing it as carrying the ""fragrance of the soil,"" he said the plan reflects the spirit of Antyodaya — development for the last person in the queue.The document identifies 13 priority sectors and 10 key missions, with good governance at the core. According to the CM, over 400 governance reforms implemented in the past two years have already made administration more transparent and citizen-friendly.Taking a political swipe at the previous Congress regime, the Chief Minister alleged that while his government has a vision for development till 2047, the Congress's five-year rule was marked by ""systematic loot"" through an organised syndicate. He claimed central agencies have placed concrete evidence of financial irregularities before courts and said the public has understood the ""true character"" of the opposition.Sai highlighted major gains in road, rail and air connectivity, expansion of premier institutions like IIT, IIM and NIT, and growth in medical education, with medical colleges increasing from 10 to 15, in addition to AIIMS.A new industrial policy and a single-window clearance system have helped attract investment proposals worth over Rs 7.5 lakh crore, he said.On energy, Sai said Chhattisgarh ranks second nationally in power generation and aims to top the list by 2030, with a strong push towards renewable energy, including large-scale solar projects and rooftop solar with double subsidies. He also underlined opportunities in agriculture, forest-based economy, mineral resources and tourism. Concluding, Sai expressed confidence that the goals outlined in the Anjor Vision 2047 would be realised from the new Assembly building and called upon all members to work together to translate the vision of a developed Chhattisgarh into reality.Congress boycottsAssemblyCongress boycotted the Assembly on the first day of the winter session, held on Dec 14, in protest against the government's decision to dedicate the entire sitting exclusively to a discussion on ""Vision 2047."" Congress claimed that this approach sidelined routine legislative business, including Question Hour, Calling Attention notices, and adjournment motions. Leader of Opposition Charandas Mahant described the presentation as misleading, arguing that it focused heavily on long-term plans and promises while ignoring pressing day-to-day issues faced by the people, such as unemployment, delays in paddy procurement, crimes against women, potholes, lack of tap water, and electricity billing problems.He accused the government of using the session to project a futuristic agenda without addressing current grievances, and termed the vision document ""heavy on claims but weak on substance.""Mahant said the Congress's boycott was a way to protest the sidelining of ordinary legislative business and highlight the government's neglect of immediate public concerns.","Chhattisgarh's first assembly session was held on dec 14, 2000.

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday criticised Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta, saying that it is not appropriate to mock anyone taking a ""Vipassana,"" despite both of them having political differences over the handling of the pollution crisis in the national capital region.""You (Rekha Gupta) harbor political enmity towards me. Due to this, it does not behove you to mock the divine Vipassana meditation method taught by Lord Buddha in this manner. You too should certainly try Vipassana once. You will like it a lot, and you will experience boundless peace. Going to do Vipassana is not called ""running away."" Only those with great fortune are blessed with Vipassana,"" Kejriwal wrote on X, replying to an earlier post by CM Gupta.The AAP leader's comments come a day after CM Gupta alleged that while Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders are trying to fight pollution by staying in Delhi, Kejriwal simply abandons Delhi by taking a Vipassana every six months.""We are finding solutions to the pollution problem in Delhi by living in Delhi itself. We are not like them who abandon Delhi to its fate and run off for Vipassana every 6 months. My Delhi, My Responsibility-we are working with this sentiment.The problem is here too, and the solution will also emerge from here...for Delhi, by staying in Delhi,"" the Delhi CM said.Meanwhile, AAP's Delhi president Saurabh Bharadwaj also hit out at the Delhi government for the illnesses people are getting due to increased pollution.He criticised CM Rekha Gupta over the worsening air quality in the national capital, stating that she is unaware of the air quality index (AQI) and its parameters, adding that she must leave the pollution problem for the experts to deal with.Speaking to ANI, Bharadwaj said, ""This government has been in power for almost a year. Nowhere in this country are there incidents of stubble burning. The condition of pollution is that even inside a closed room, we can see smog. The CM of Delhi doesn't know what AQI is? She says any instrument can measure AQI. She can't even properly pronounce AQI. What will the people of Delhi expect from the chief minister for the next 4 years?""""I think experts should come in front and the Chief Minister should take a step back,"" he added.Residents of Delhi on Sunday expressed deep concern over deteriorating air quality as the city's AQI surged to 497, remaining in the 'severe' category, according to the central pollution control board (CPCB).In response to the severe pollution, the Delhi Government's Directorate of Education on Saturday directed that schools conduct classes for grades IX and XI in hybrid mode. This decision followed the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) invoking Stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) as AQI levels approached the 'severe' mark.","Aam aadmi party (aap) national convenor arvind kejriwal on sunday criticised delhi chief minister rekha gupta.
