Lapsed 5% Muslim quota in Maha formally nullified,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lapsed-5-muslim-quota-in-maha-formally-nullified/articleshow/128534765.cms,"Chief Minister of Maharashtra Devendra Fadnavis

Mumbai: Eleven years after the BJP-Sena govt led by Devendra Fadnavis scrapped the 5% Muslim quota in govt jobs and education, the Mahayuti govt has cancelled a circular outlining the process of issuing caste validity certificates for the quota. Officials said the long-delayed process was completed after a query was raised in the last state assembly session.The 5% minority quota had been introduced by the Congress-NCP govt led in June 2014. However, the ordinance lapsed by Dec 2014 since it had not been converted into an Act under the subsequent BJP-Sena govt led by Fadnavis. A high court petition also led to a stay on the quota for jobs.In March 2015, the Fadnavis govt issued an order officially cancelling the ordinance. However, a related circular on caste validity certificates for minorities issued by the social justice department was overlooked. It is this circular which has now been cancelled. ""This is just a formality,"" said an official.","The 5% minority quota had been introduced by the congress-ncp govt led in june 2014.

SC stays exhumation of bodies of tribal Christians for burial elsewhere,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-stays-exhumation-of-bodies-of-tribal-christians-for-burial-elsewhere/articleshow/128534664.cms,"Supreme Court

New Delhi: Supreme Court has put an interim stay on the exhumation of bodies of tribal Christians in certain Chhattisgarh villages for their relocation to the religious community's designated graveyards, as an NGO said this act violates the fundamental rights of local Christians to be buried in their villages.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta agreed on Wednesday to hear a petition by the NGO - Chhattisgarh Association for Justice and Equality - after senior advocate Colin Gonsalves cited SC's split verdict on a plea seeking burial of a pastor's body in his village or his agricultural field.While one judge had permitted the petitioner to bury his father's body in his private land, the other judge had said no citizen had an unqualified right to choose the place of burial. After the split decision in Jan last year, the bench had directed burial of the body at a designated burial ground 25-30 km from the village in Chhattisgarh.After hearing Gonsalves, Justices Nath and Mehta sought response from the Chhattisgarh govt to the PIL and ordered that no further exhumation of bodies would be permitted.Gonsalves accused the state govt of misusing the split verdict to stop burial of tribal Christians at places within a village's precincts.The senior advocate said the court must intervene to direct that irrespective of religion, caste or status, every dead person has a right to burial at demarcated places in his/her village.The petitioner said the authorities should be directed to demarcate such land for burial in those villages which do not have designated burial grounds.Interestingly, the bench of Justices Nath and Mehta on Monday had refused to entertain a petition challenging the Oct 28, 2025 order of the Chhattisgarh high court asking the petitioners to approach statutory authority on their grievances against gram sabhas which have put up hoardings barring entry of Christian pastors and priests purportedly to prevent conversion through allurement.",Supreme court has put an interim stay on the exhumation of bodies of tribal christians in certain chhattisgarh villages.

New Delhi: Given the proliferation of financial scams through ponzi schemes, Supreme Court has ruled that conning people of their hard-earned money falls in the category of heinous crimes and that the accused in such offences cannot claim benefit of the liberty-leaning principle of 'bail is the rule and jail the exception'.A bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and K Vinod Chandran set aside an order of Allahabad HC that had granted bail to the main accused in a cheating-cum-forgery case - who absconded for a long period - on the grounds that his co-accused have been granted bail and it is a cheating case triable by a magistrate, thus categorising it as a non-heinous offence. ""We may note that the value of life and liberty of members of society is not limited only to their 'person', but would also extend to the quality of their life, including their economic well-being,"" said Justice Kumar.Justice Kumar wrote the judgment in the financial fraud case that raises the threshhold for economic offenders to get bail by putting them on a par with those charged with heinous crimes. ""In offences of a pecuniary nature, where innocent people are cheated of their hard-earned money by conmen, who make it their life's pursuit to exploit and feast upon the gullibility of others, the aforestated factors must necessarily be weighed while dealing with the alleged offenders' pleas for grant of bail,"" he said in the judgment.Referring to the accused person's activities of forging names and identity cards, and his intention to dupe and cheat people, the bench said this demonstrates that he is a career criminal and a menace to society.

INDORE: Displaying striking indifference during a crime scene reconstruction, the accused in the murder of a 24-year-old MBA student reacted casually when questioned by reporters, brushing aside queries about the killing.Surrounded by media personnel on Tuesday, Piyush Dhamnodiya shrugged off questions about the motive behind the murder. “Kuch nai hua hai, chhodo, ho gaya jo hogaya yaar… chhod do na… kya karoge jaan ke,” he said in Hindi, refusing to explain his actions. When asked whether he regretted the crime, he responded with a faint smirk and said he would reveal the reason “when the time comes”.Police officials present at the reconstruction described his demeanour as unusually calm. Officers said his behaviour during interrogation and subsequent proceedings appeared erratic and detached.According to investigators, the accused allegedly muttered apologies in the hours following the crime and claimed he wanted to “communicate with the victim’s spirit”. He also told police he had contemplated suicide by jumping in front of a train but did not act on it.During questioning at the Dwarkapuri police station, Dhamnodiya reportedly asked for a blank sheet of paper and wrote that he had committed a “grave wrong” and wanted to die.He repeatedly requested officers to let him meet the victim, claiming he loved her.DCP Krishna Lalchandani said the accused had been consuming occult-related online content and searching for suicide methods, though he never attempted self-harm. Investigators also learned that Dhamnodiya suspected the victim of speaking to other men.Police said the woman’s body was recovered on Feb 13 from a rented room in Indore, three days after she was reported missing. Dhamnodiya, identified as her boyfriend and classmate, was traced to Mumbai and arrested from Andheri on Feb 14.During interrogation, police alleged that Dhamnodiya tied the victim’s hands and legs, gagged her and strangled her. Officers further claimed he later purchased beer, returned to the room and consumed alcohol beside the body. Investigators accused him of sexually assaulting the corpse and engaging in acts of necrophilia before fleeing.Police said the accused travelled by train after leaving Indore, changing routes before reaching Mumbai. Investigators stated he later went to a deserted location near Panvel, where he allegedly lit incense sticks and watched online videos about summoning spirits.Dwarkapuri police seized items linked to the crime and recreated the scene. The accused is scheduled to be produced before a court on Wednesday.",Piyush dhamnodiya shrugged off questions about the motive behind the murder.

Gurgaon: Shocking Murder, School Chaos, Delivery Scam Bust & More





ROHTAK: The murder of a 27-year-old bank employee, found with her throat slit near Bahadurgarh in Jhajjar district, was solved within 18 hours, with police arresting her husband — a chartered accountant from Hisar — as the prime accused.Investigators said the accused killed his wife over repeated suspicions about her character and then attempted to pass it off as a robbery-cum-murder.The victim, Mahak, worked with HDFC Bank in Gurgaon.She was married to Anshul Dhawan, a chartered accountant and resident of Hisar’s Sector 14, on September 25, 2025, in an arranged marriage. The couple had been married for barely five months.On Valentine’s Day (February 14), the couple visited Hisar and stayed with family.The next evening, around 7 pm on February 15, they left Mahak’s parental home in Hansi for Gurugram. About four hours later, Anshul called the police, claiming unidentified attackers had intercepted their car near Pahsaur village in the Badli area of Jhajjar district, killed his wife, and fled.Police found Mahak’s body lying outside the car on a dirt track about 100 metres off the Jhajjar-Badli road. Her throat had been slit.However, Anshul’s version soon fell apart during questioning. He failed to describe the alleged attackers and repeatedly changed his statement.During sustained interrogation and a crime scene reconstruction, Anshul confessed. Police said the couple frequently argued over his suspicions about Mahak’s character. The dispute escalated during the drive, leading him to first strangle her and then slit her throat with a pair of scissors, allegedly while wearing gloves to avoid leaving evidence. He later staged the scene to resemble a robbery.Mahak’s father, Krishna Kathuria, had expressed suspicion against his son-in-law from the outset. Family members also stated that Mahak was pregnant at the time of her death.Police have arrested the accused and are proceeding with further investigation.","The victim, mahak, worked with hdfc bank in gurgaon.

‘Targeting People Like Terrorists’: Mamata Banerjee Attacks EC Over SIR, Cites Bangladesh Polls

Mayapur/Kolkata: Politics surrounding SIR took a back seat to spiritual reflection as home minister Amit Shah travelled Wednesday to Mayapur in Bengal's Nadia, the cradle of Bhakti movement, for a pre-poll Matua outreach focused on highlighting the community's contribution towards what he called ""unification of Hindu society"".Shah lavished praise on social reformers like Matua Mahasangha founder Harichand Thakur and his son Guruchand Thakur and the Vaishnavite saint Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati, whom he described as the bridge between the Bhakti movement and ""modernity"". ""Harichand and Guruchand Thakur, and Matua society as a whole, took the idea of social welfare forward,"" he told a gathering, highlighting their campaign against untouchability and promotion of education and gender equality within the community.Shah, a guest at the 152nd birth anniversary of Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati, said he was in Mayapur not as the home minister but as a devotee of the founder of 64 Gaudiya maths (monasteries) in India and abroad.Conveying PM Modi's ""Hare Krishna"" greeting to those attending the event, Shah said, ""Whenever foreign guests visit Modiji, he presents them a copy of the Bhagavad Gita. The epicentre of Bhakti movement was in Nadia and will spread in the days to come.I am sure we will be able to send the message of Viksit Bharat and Sanatan (dharma) to the world.""Sources said Shah's visit was crucial to BJP's relationship with Matua Mahasangha, an influential community in large parts of southern WB, ahead of polls later this year. But party functionaries in Bengal insisted that the HM didn't want politics to creep into his message of solidarity with the community.","Home minister amit shah travelled to mayapur in bengal's nadia, the cradle of bhakti movement.

NEW DELHI: The governing NDA is set to further strengthen its tally in the Upper House after biennial polls for 37 seats in Rajya Sabha on March 16, but the fate of prominent retiring members such as Sharad Pawar (NCP-SP), Abhishek Manu Singhvi (Congress), Ramdas Athawale (RPI-A), Tiruchi Siva (DMK) and Priyanka Chaturvedi (Sena UBT) will depend on how their respective parties coordinate with their alliance partners.BJP-led NDA's tally is expected to cross 130 with the advantage of at least four additional members in Rajya Sabha, whose current strength is 243 with one vacancy each in Jharkhand and West Bengal.The states where seats will be vacant in April are Maharashtra (7 seats), Tamil Nadu (6 ), West Bengal (5), Bihar (5 ), Odisha (4), Assam (3), Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Haryana (2 each), and Himachal Pradesh (1).NDA has govts in six - Maharashtra, Odisha, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Assam - of the 10 states where seats will be vacant due to members retiring, giving it a clear advantage. The opposition alliance has govts in Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and West Bengal.In Maharashtra, since the governing coalition, Mahayuti, is expected to secure six seats as against one by opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi, it's advantage NDA in the state.On the other hand, MVA will see a lot of political maneuvering as the alliance will have to choose between the candidates of Sena UBT and NCP(SP). In case NCP(SP) sticks with Pawar, it is to be seen whether NCP extends his support to him amid talks of a merger of the factions.Despite not having the numbers, NCP (SP) working president Supriya Sule didn't rule out the possibility of nominating her father, claiming that a MVA meeting would be held soon to finalise a name.The seven Rajya Sabha members from Maharashtra whose terms are set to expire on April 2 are Pawar, Fauzia Khan (NCP-SP), Bhagwat Kishanrao Karad (BJP), Dhairyasheel Patil (BJP), Athawale, Chaturvedi and Rajani Patil (Congress).In Bihar, polls will be held for five seats, three of which are held by governing NDA, including two by JDU.RJD, the principal opposition party in the state, has only 25 MLAs, leaving the combined strength of the alliance (Congress and the Left) at 35 - five less than the number it would require to retain an RS berth. In this scenario, it would be extremely difficult for RJD to repeat MP and former Union minister Prem Ch-and Gupta in the Upper House.In West Bengal, the governing Trinamool Congress is expected to win four of the five RS seats while the opposition BJP may secure one.","Bjp-led nda's tally is expected to cross 130 with the advantage of at least four additional members in rajya sabha.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu on Wednesday pitched for greater federalism, with the state assembly tabling the Justice Kurian Joseph Committee report on Centre-state relations that recommended diminished powers for the governor and a greater role for states in constitutional amendments.In Part-1 of the report, which runs into 387 pages, the three-member panel said for the appointment of state governors, Article 155 of the Constitution should be amended ""to bind the President to appoint one of the three names approved by a majority of the state assembly"". It recommended a non-renewable five-year term for governors and proposed they be barred from holding any further constitutional office except that of the President and the vice-president.CM MK Stalin called for constitutional amendments and structural reforms to decentralise powers and provide greater autonomy to states. ""How long should we remain the receiver and the Union the provider?"" he said.Governors should not hold office in a political party or any office of the executive, legislature or judiciary in the five years preceding appointment, the report said. It also sought amendments to impose timelines for gubernatorial and presidential action on bills, with deemed assent on expiry, citing the framework laid down by Supreme Court in April 2025.The committee recommended doing away with the governor's address at the start of an assembly session and divesting the governor of the statutory role of chancellor of state universities. ""Dissolution (of the legislative assembly) shall be ordered solely on ministerial advice,"" it suggested.The panel sought a larger say for states in elections, education, health, delimitation and GST. The report slammed the three-language formula and suggested the country shift from ""weak trilingualism to high-proficiency bilingualism"". It said India must abandon the ""one nation one language"" policy and urged Union govt to correct Census distortions by ending misclassification of 53 languages as dialects of Hindi.On territorial integrity, the panel said the consent of the affected state legislature should be obtained before the President recommends introducing a bill to create a new state, and that the same principle should apply to altering the area, boundaries or name of a state.The report said the ""one nation, one election"" proposal should be withdrawn as it violates the basic structure of the Constitution. It proposed limiting EC's role to elections for Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, President, Vice-President and Union Territories, while independent state election commissions conduct polls to state legislatures and local bodies.","Tamil nadu assembly tabling justice kurian joseph committee report on centre-state relations.

NEW DELHI: Indian naval cadets will now get dedicated “floating classrooms” at sea as the Indian Navy has launched ‘INS Krishna’, the first in a new series of indigenous three cadet training ships (CTS).Unlike earlier when training opportunities at sea were limited, these “dedicated floating classrooms and living labs” have been designed to provide cadets with hands-on experience in navigation, seamanship and watch-keeping in real-world sea conditions. The three ships, which will serve as the backbone of the Navy's sea training infrastructure for the next 30 years, will host trainees soon after they complete their basic training ashore.In keeping with the Naval traditions, Anupama Chauhan, wife of CDS General Anil Chauhan, launched INS Krishna in the presence of the CDS and senior officials of the armed forces and ship-builder Larsen & Toubro (L&T). INS Krishna (designated ‘Yard 18003)’, which was constructed at the L&T shipyard in Kattupalli near Chennai, is planned for formal delivery and operational availability to the Navy by year-end.The ships will also be used for training cadets from friendly foreign countries, enhancing India’s defence cooperation.In addition to training, these ships can be used for non-combatant evacuation operations, humanitarian aid and disaster relief, and search-and-rescue operations.Krishna can accommodate 20 officers, 150 sailors and 200 cadets simultaneously. It has three classrooms (70 cadets each), a dedicated training bridge, and a chart house.

NEW DELHI: Fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya on Wednesday informed the Bombay high court that he cannot specify when he will return to India as he is legally barred from leaving the United Kingdom.In a statement submitted through his counsel Amit Desai, Mallya said that he does not have an active Indian passport and is also restrained by court orders in England and Wales from travelling outside the UK.The submission came after a bench of Chief Justice Shree Chandrashekhar and Justice Gautam Ankhad last week made it clear that it would not hear his plea challenging the order declaring him a fugitive economic offender unless he returns to India.The court had asked Mallya to clarify whether he intended to come back to the country.Mallya, who has been based in the UK since leaving India in March 2016, has filed two petitions before the high court, one challenging the order declaring him a fugitive economic offender and another questioning the constitutional validity of the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act.In his statement read out in court, Mallya said that he cannot give a definite date for his return as his passport was revoked by the Indian government in 2016 and because courts in England and Wales have prohibited him from leaving the country.“Mallya is not permitted to leave or attempt to leave England and Wales or apply for or be in possession of any international travel document. In any event, the petitioner is unable to precisely state when he will return to India,” Desai read out from the statement.The senior counsel further argued that Mallya’s physical presence in India was not necessary for the court to hear his pleas against the fugitive tag and the provisions of the Act.“If he (Mallya) were to appear in India, then all these proceedings would be rendered irrelevant as the statute says that once the offender appears in the concerned court of law, then all these orders would be set aside,” Desai told the court.Mallya, 70, faces multiple cases of alleged fraud and money laundering linked to the default of loans amounting to several thousand crores. He was declared a Fugitive Economic Offender in January 2019 by a special court hearing cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.The high court has directed the Union government to file its reply to Mallya’s statement and posted the matter for further hearing next month.",Vijay mallya tells bombay high court that he cannot specify when he will return to india.

Mumbai: The Bombay HC recently transferred to the CBI a probe into a 2010 accidental death case of a 13-year-old schoolgirl, saying police did not consider the autopsy report that said in the last 24 hours before her death, she was subjected to sexual intercourse.Police relied on an incomplete video recording and statement of doctors who had not seen the postmortem, HC said.

NAGPUR: In a ruling clarifying the legal status of electronic communication in criminal proceedings, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court last week held that summons issued through WhatsApp is legally valid under Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023, and set aside an order imposing costs on a police personnel for effecting such service,.Justice Urmila Joshi-Phalke quashed a Jan 21 order of a Pocso court in Nagpur which directed recovery of costs from constable Santosh Ramteke on the ground that summons served through a mobile phone was ""not allowed"". The court faulted the trial court for ignoring amended provisions under BNSS.The Pocso court noted that two prosecution witnesses in a pending case were absent and that the summons was served via mobile phone, resulting in delay in recording evidence. The court imposed costs on the constable for not serving the summons through a ""legal mode"". The Maharashtra govt challenged the trial court order, filing a criminal plea on behalf of Lakadganj police station.The state argued that the trial court overlooked BNSS section 70 under which electronically served summons are deemed legally valid, and section 530 which permits trials, inquiries and proceedings, including service of summons, to be conducted in electronic mode.Justice Joshi-Phalke observed that the purpose of service is to put a person on notice and that ""the mode is surely irrelevant"".","Bombay hc rules that summons issued through whatsapp is legally valid under bharatiya nagarik suraksha sanhita (bnss), 2023.

Kolkata: A 14-year-old case involving a sacked Bengal govt staffer seeking reinstatement turned on its head this week when Calcutta HC gave the current govt the freedom to investigate what the judge termed ""unexplainable favouritism"" towards the petitioner by a former Left Front minister in 2010.""What can be a greater example of lawlessness?"" Justice Rai Chattopadhyay said on Tuesday of petitioner Tithi Adhikary being accommodated in the then education minister's office despite her services being terminated earlier on charges of dereliction of duty.

Indore: A video of a woman being beaten in Indore has exposed a disturbing surge in mob violence fuelled by rumours of child-lifting, with innocent people being attacked in multiple districts of Madhya Pradesh without any evidence.The woman in the video, who was assaulted in Bhanwarkuan area here, was identified as Rekha Devi, a 45-year-old woman with mental health issues who has been missing from Meerut for over a year. After her daughter traced her through the clip, police confirmed that Rekha had been questioned and released as she was not involved in any crime. She has since gone missing again.Rekha's case is part of a wider pattern of panic-driven attacks in Indore and its neighbouring districts where strangers are being confronted and beaten on the mere suspicion of being child-lifters. Police said that none of the recent cases involved any actual kidnapping.In Ratlam, six men returning from a temple were dragged out of their car and assaulted by villagers when they stopped at a roadside dhaba. A 34-year-old researcher was surrounded, beaten and filmed by a group of women who accused her of child-lifting in Indore's MIG area.In Dhar district, five itinerant workers from Rajasthan narrowly escaped after being attacked over similar rumours.Dewas police arrested two men for spreading false messages and inciting attacks on passersby.Senior officers have warned that rumours circulating on WhatsApp and local networks are triggering fear and mob violence.""There is no confirmed child abduction gang operating in Indore or nearby districts,"" said Indore police commissioner Santosh Kumar Singh. ""People must not act on rumours or take the law into their own hands,"" he said.Police have urged citizens to report suspicious activity instead of confronting individuals, stressing that rumour-mongering and mob assault are criminal offences.","A video of a woman being beaten in indore has exposed a disturbing surge in mob violence fuelled by rumours of child-lifting.

Can't force dad's caste on child raised by single mom: Bombay HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-force-dads-caste-on-child-raised-by-single-mom-bombay-hc/articleshow/128530357.cms,"Bombay HC

MUMBAI: A child raised exclusively by her mother cannot be compelled to carry her father's surname and caste merely because the format once demanded it, Bombay HC said recently.The order was in response to a petition filed by a 12-year-old girl seeking correction of her name in school records and also of the caste entry from 'Maratha' to 'Scheduled Caste'.The child's request was rejected by school authorities last year, citing Secondary School Code.The HC ruling, made available on Wednesday, stated: ""Recognition of a single mother as a complete parent for purposes of a child's civic identity is not an act of charity; it is constitutional fidelity. It reflects the movement from patriarchal compulsion to constitutional choice, from lineage as fate to dignity as right.""The court further said, ""A society that claims to be developing cannot insist that a child's public identity must be anchored to a father who is absent from the child's life, while the mother, who bears the entire burden of upbringing, remains administratively secondary. The state's formats must not become moral judgments; they must become accurate instruments of welfare.""A school record was not a private note but ""a public document that follows a child across years, institutions, and sometimes into the professional domain"", observed Justices Vibha Kankanwadi and H S Venegaonkar in a Feb 2 judgment from Bombay HC's Aurangabad bench.""If lived guardianship is maternal, the record cannot insist on paternal visibility as a matter of routine, and then call it administrative neutrality. ''The child's mother was a single parent and her natural guardian, HC said. The mother had accused the child's father of sexual assault. Later, they reached a settlement, and it was agreed that the daughter would remain in the permanent custody of the mother.The minor and her mother, both petitioners, asserted that continuation of the father's surname in the school record did not merely create an inaccuracy but also ""an avoidable social vulnerability for a child who must grow up, learn, and form her identity in society that often treat names as identity for family history"".",Bombay hc: a child raised exclusively by her mother cannot be compelled to carry her father's surname and caste.
