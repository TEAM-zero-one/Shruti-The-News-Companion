Omar’s party goes unrepresented as party MP opts out of outreach trip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/omars-party-goes-unrepresented-as-party-mp-opts-out-of-outreach-trip/articleshow/121400097.cms,"SRINAGAR: J&K’s National Conference (NC) has no plans to nominate another representative for the all-party delegations briefing foreign nations and UN members about India’s anti-terrorism position and Operation Sindoor after party MP Mian Altaf Ahmad declined to join the team currently visiting key countries. NC will not have political representation in any of the seven delegations.Centre had nominated the Anantnag–Rajouri MP for the delegation led by DMK MP Kanimozhi in his capacity as NC’s parliamentary head, party sources said Sunday. The team includes Rajiv Rai (SP), Capt Brijesh Chowta (BJP), Prem Chand Gupta (RJD), and ambassador Jawed Ashraf. It was in Russia Saturday.Three politicians from J&K — Ghulam Nabi Azad (Democratic Progressive Azad Party), Mian Altaf (NC), and Ghulam Ali Khatana (BJP) — had been named for these outreach efforts.Altaf opted out as he is engaged with the annual religious ceremony of Hazrat Mian Nizamuddin Kiyanvi, popularly known as Baba Nagri, held in early June at Wangath in Kangan of Ganderbal district. The event draws thousands of devotees across J&K.A senior NC functionary said while the party was consulted and Altaf’s consent was sought, the nomination was Centre’s decision. “Centre didn’t ask us for his replacement after he declined,” the functionary said.“Since he was nominated as parliamentary head, I don’t think anyone else can represent NC now.”Tensions within NC also surfaced Sunday, as MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi accused party brass of yielding to Centre on Article 370 . On X, Mehdi wrote: “Oh leader! Either rise and speak up for your people, or step down, wear bangles, and remain confined to a palanquin.”The post appeared to target CM Omar Abdullah , who had earlier posted: “Sunday musing. There are doers & there are talkers. That’s why I don’t talk as much as some people I know.”The internal rift became public during NC’s working committee meeting on May 21, where Mehdi voiced frustration over lack of progress on restoring Article 370.",Nc will not have political representation in any of the seven delegations. Centre had nominated the anantnag–rajouri mp for the delegation led by dmk mp kanimozhi. Altaf opted out as he is engaged with the annual religious ceremony of hazrat mian nizamuddin kiyanvi.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121400094,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-910342,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

"Pension isn't charity but a legal right, shouldn't be delayed even by a day: HC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pension-isnt-charity-but-a-legal-right-shouldnt-be-delayed-even-by-a-day-hc/articleshow/121399704.cms,"HC: Any delay in pension against principles of equity & justice

KOLKATA: Pension is not ""an act of charity"" but a legal right of employees, Calcutta high court said while reprimanding Hooghly Chinsurah municipality for blaming technological lapses for a delay in releasing the pension of 148 people who retired as Group D workers. The court said the employees earned the right by putting in years of service.Justice Gaurang Kanth said, ""Pension and other retiral benefits, once earned by an employee after rendering long and continuous service ought not be delayed even by a single day. Delay in such cases causes undue hardship to the retired employees who depend on these dues for their sustenance.""He made the observation while hearing a petitioner's case who, along with 147 others, was employed in 1991-92.The posts — coolie, dome, methor, trailorman and jharuyali — were later clubbed under one umbrella post of ‘conservancy worker’. All of them were treated as permanent employees and were to receive monthly pension. However, following the petitioner’s retirement in 2023, her pension and other benefits were not released.In 2021, Bengal municipalities adapted an e-pension portal. Data for this comes from an integrated online salary management system — Urban Local Bodies Human Resource Management System — introduced in August 2017.Despite change in names of traditional posts, retired employees didn’t feature on the portal. Directorate of local bodies submitted in court that the municipality failed to provide details of all Group D employees. Hence, pension and retiral benefits had not been released.Court directed the municipality to submit all documents to the directorate within a week and the latter redesignate the employees within two weeks. Justice Kanth said any undue delay in disbursement of pension, “especially if occasioned by technological shortcomings or administrative lapses, is impermissible and contrary to the principles of equity, justice, and good governance”.","Hc: any delay in pension against principles of equity & justice.

Monsoon arrives early in India: Here's what caused the unusual shift,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/monsoon-arrives-early-in-india-heres-what-caused-the-unusual-shift/articleshow/121392043.cms,"Agency photo

Poll Should the government invest more in weather forecasting systems? Yes, definitely. No, current investments are sufficient.

Why monsoon arrived early?

NEW DELHI: The southwest monsoon arrived in Kerala on Saturday, May 24, eight days ahead of its usual onset date of June 1, marking its earliest appearance on the Indian mainland since 2009, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.This early onset, according to IMD Scientist Neetha K Gopal, aligns with their official forecast which had projected monsoon arrival around May 27, with a margin of four days.“Monsoon onset took place today, 24th May, and it is much ahead of its schedule. Normally, the standard monsoon arrival date in Kerala is 1st June, but IMD has already forecasted that the monsoon will reach early this year,” Gopal told ANI. “The official forecast was 27th May with a model of 4 days. That means the monsoon could reach 4 days before 27th May or 4 days after 27th May. So, our forecast has also come true today.”The early monsoon has not only covered Kerala but also advanced into the Lakshadweep area, the south Arabian Sea, parts of the west-central and east-central Arabian Sea, and some parts of Karnataka and Maharashtra.It has also spread into the remaining areas of the Maldives and Comorin, many parts of Tamil Nadu, and the southwest and east-central Bay of Bengal, along with parts of Mizoram and the north Bay of Bengal.Conditions remain favourable for the monsoon to further advance into central Arabian Sea, Goa, more areas of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, additional parts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and deeper into northeastern states and Sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim over the next two to three days.The early arrival of the southwest monsoon is driven by a combination of favourable atmospheric and oceanic conditions. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), a low-pressure area developed over the Arabian Sea along with a trough line extending across Vidarbha. These systems significantly enhanced moisture inflow and atmospheric convection, accelerating the monsoon's advance over the Indian subcontinent.One of the earliest signs of this accelerated progression was the monsoon’s arrival over the south Andaman Sea and adjoining areas on May 13, well ahead of the normal onset date of May 21. This early advancement helped set the pace for its swift movement toward Kerala.Additionally, neutral El Nino–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions were observed during the period, which typically support a normal or stronger monsoon, unlike El Niño years that often suppress rainfall over India. Another contributing factor may have been reduced snow cover over the Himalayan region, a condition that historically correlates with more vigorous monsoon activity.The advancement is expected to benefit key sectors reliant on the monsoon, such as agriculture, fisheries, and livestock. Favourable monsoons not only help these sectors prepare better for extreme weather and climate change but also validate the economic importance of government investments in weather and forecasting systems.Significant initiatives like the Monsoon Mission and High Performance Computing-based forecasting systems have improved resource management, crop yields, and reduced weather-related losses in recent years.I MD data shows that the last time the monsoon hit the Indian coast earlier than this year was in 2009, when it arrived on May 23. Commenting on the northeast monsoon, B Amudha, head of the Regional Meteorological Centre, said, “At present, we cannot say anything about the performance of the northeast monsoon on the basis of southwest monsoon. Let us monitor the progress, and then we will issue the long-range forecast. ”“The normal date of onset of south west monsoon is June 1. This year Southwest monsoon has set in on 24th May. This is much earlier than the normal onset. If you look at the data from the past 16 years, in 2009, the monsoon set in on 23rd May,” she added.Meanwhile, a depression over the south Konkan coast is expected to move eastward and weaken into a well-marked low-pressure area over the next 12 hours.The IMD has issued red and orange alerts for multiple districts in Kerala over the coming days. On Saturday, red alerts were declared for Kasaragod and Kannur, while orange alerts were issued for 11 other districts including Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, and Ernakulam.The IMD also reported heavy to very heavy rainfall in several parts of Kerala, Mahe, and coastal Maharashtra, as well as isolated heavy showers in South Interior Karnataka, Odisha, Bihar, Madhya Maharashtra, Goa, Uttarakhand, Vidarbha, Saurashtra, Kutch, and Tamil Nadu (including Puducherry and Karaikal) till 8 am on Saturday.“For the next 2 days, we have a red alert in the Nilgiris district. The southwest monsoon primarily affects taluks like Ooty, Kunda...the people here are requested to follow precautions and not venture out unless in an emergency...All the boating activities have been stopped for today, and it may remain like this for the next 2 days,” she told ANI.As the monsoon continues to advance rapidly, officials are keeping a close watch on its trajectory and associated weather developments across the country.","The southwest monsoon arrived in kerala on saturday, may 24, eight days ahead of its usual onset date of june 1. It is the earliest appearance on the indian mainland since 2009, the india meteorological department (imd) said.

Fallout from RJD



'True embodiment of Lalu Prasad's Jungle Raj era'



NEW DELHI: While Tejashwi Yadav is emerging as a prominent face of opposition against the Nitish Kumar-led NDA government of Bihar, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav 's eldest son has once again led the party and the family into chaos.A day after Tej Pratap ""confessed"" to his 12-year-long relationship with a woman through a Facebook post and later claimed his account was hacked, Lalu on Saturday ostracised his son from the party for six years and disowned him from the family.""Ignoring moral values in personal life weakens our collective struggle for social justice. The activities, public conduct, and irresponsible behavior of the eldest son are not in accordance with our family values and traditions. Therefore, due to the above circumstances, I remove him from the party and family. From now on, he will not have any role of any kind in the party and family. He is expelled from the party for 6 years,"" Lalu said in a social media post on X.""He is capable of seeing the good and bad, and the merits and demerits of his personal life. All those who will have relations with him should take their own decisions. I have always been an advocate of public shame in public life.The obedient members of the family have adopted and followed this idea in public life,"" he added.However, this is not the first time Tej Pratap's personal life has rocked the family. His marriage and subsequent divorce also made headlines a few years back.Tej Pratap married Aishwarya Rai, the granddaughter of former Bihar chief minister Daroga Prasad Rai, in 2018. However, within five months of marriage, Tej Pratap filed for divorce.The separation led to a high-profile legal battle, political and personal drama, with her father, former minister Chandrika Rai, quitting the RJD and vowing to fight for his daughter both ""politically and legally.""Later, Aishwarya also alleged that her husband was a drug addict and often dressed up like Radha, Krishna, and Shiva, claiming to be their avatar.""Tej used to dress up like Lord Radha and Krishna. Soon after my wedding, I discovered that he used to dress up like gods and goddesses. Not only this, once after consuming drugs, Tej wore a 'ghagra' (long skirt) and 'choli' (blouse) and dressed up like goddess Radha. He also wore makeup and a hair wig,"" Aishwarya alleged in her complaint.Aishwarya claimed that when she confronted Tej and asked him to stop using drugs and dressing up like this, he responded: ""Ganja toh Bhole Baba ka prasad hai, usko kaise mana karein? (Marijuana is Lord Shiva's offering; how can I refuse it?)""Aishwarya said in her complaint that she tried to bring the issue to her in-laws’ attention, but they did not help her in any way.""I did talk to my mother-in-law and sister-in-law regarding Tej's behavior, and they assured me that he wouldn't act that way anymore. My in-laws consoled me emotionally, but Tej's behavior did not change at all,"" she said.In 2019, just before the general elections, Tej Pratap Yadav formed a new party named after his parents, titled the ""Lalu-Rabri Morcha,"" after resigning from his post in the RJD in protest against the party's decision to field his father-in-law, Chandrika Rai, from the Saran constituency.The rift was later reconciled, and Tej Pratap was eventually persuaded to fall in line under the party’s campaign slogan: ""Tej Raftaar, Tejashwi Sarkar.""He later acknowledged his younger brother’s leadership, saying, ""Didn’t you see his statement? He’s my Krishna, and I’m his Arjun.""Following the 2019 elections, Tej Pratap withdrew from the public eye and was later seen in Vrindavan, draped in yellow robes, seemingly immersed in devotion and remembrance of his deity, Lord Krishna.Apart from this, Tej Pratap has also been accused of being a ""true embodiment of Lalu Prasad's Jungle Raj era"" by the opponents. The rivals claim he has mistreated both police personnel and his own party workers on several occasions.In March this year, Tej Pratap Yadav ordered a police constable to dance during a Holi celebration to avoid suspension.In the video, Tej Pratap, seated on a stage, is heard telling the uniformed officer, ""Ae sipahi, Deepak, ek gana bajayenge, uspe tumko thumka lagana hai. Bura mat mano, Holi hai. Aaj nahi thumka lagaoge toh suspend kar diye jaoge. (Hey constable Deepak, we’ll play a song and you have to dance to it. Don’t mind, it’s Holi. If you don’t dance today, you’ll be suspended)."" He then adds, ""Bura mat maano, Holi hai,"" before beginning to sing a Holi song.Yadav also rode a scooter near the chief minister’s residence, shouting ""Happy Holi Paltu Chacha,"" a remark aimed at Nitish for aligning and parting ways with the RJD twice in the past.During the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Tej Pratap lost his cool and pushed his own party worker while celebrating Misa Bharti's nomination for Patliputra Lok Sabha constituency in Bihar.","Tejashwi yadav is emerging as a prominent face of opposition against the nitish kumar-led nda government of bihar.

Kerala Hit by Earliest Monsoon Since 2009 | IMD Predicts Above-Normal Rainfall for 2025

NEW DELHI: A video showing rainwater overflowing from a canopy at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport after a heavy downpour has sparked a political row, with the Congress taking a direct swipe at the BJP government over infrastructure quality.The incident occurred early Sunday as the National Capital Region was battered by rain, thunderstorms, and gusty winds.The Kerala unit of the Congress shared the video on social media platform X, sarcastically commenting, ""Vikas overflows in Delhi airport after a drizzle.""The video showed water collecting in the middle of a sloped canopy before eventually spilling over, soaking the surrounding area.In a separate post, the party criticised the waterlogging near Terminal 3 of IGI Airport that disrupted travel, saying, “This G20 infra built at inflated cost joins the long list of crumbling 'Modi-quality' constructions.”As seen in the video, the canopy collapse happened due to the design's bowl-like structure, which allowed water to pool in the centre. As the pressure mounted, the tensile fabric failed to hold the accumulated water, leading to a dramatic overflow.As per ANI, the heavy rains led to the diversion of 49 flights, including 17 international flights, between 11.30 pm and 4 am. In a passenger advisory issued at 6.50 am, Delhi airport said, “Passengers are advised to check their flight status regularly and stay in touch with airline staff for updates.”Visuals from other parts of Delhi, including Moti Bagh and Minto Road, showed widespread waterlogging. A car was seen submerged at Minto Road, while traffic snarls were reported at several key junctions including Dhaula Kuan.The IMD had issued a red alert for Delhi and surrounding areas, predicting thunderstorms, lightning, and wind speeds up to 100 km/h.Also read: IMD issues warning as pre-monsoon showers hit Delhi, Kolkata, Goa & other cities The incident comes nearly a year after a roof collapse at Terminal 1 of the Delhi airport during similar weather conditions, which left one person dead and several injured.

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav on Sunday reacted to his elder brother Tej Pratap Yadav ’s Facebook ""relationship confession,"" saying, ""we cannot tolerate such things,"" but added that Tej Pratap is ""an adult and free to make his own decisions"".Tej Pratap Yadav, the elder son of RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad Yadav , revealed on Saturday that he has been in a relationship for the past 12 years, raising eyebrows, as he married the granddaughter of a prominent Bihar politician in 2018 and is currently involved in a legal battle over divorce.Within hours, however, Tej Pratap removed the Facebook post and claimed that his account was hacked and that an attempt was being made to defame him and his family using AI-generated photos.Responding to the whole incident, Tejashwi Yadav, Bihar's ex-deputy CM, said: ""We cannot tolerate such things, we are working and are dedicated to the people of Bihar. If it's about my big brother, political life and personal life are different. He has the right to make his personal decisions. He is an adult and free to make decisions.""Tejashwi also reiterated Lalu's decision to expel Tej Pratap from the party and the family, saying: ""Our party's chief has made it clear, and ever since he has said so, it is his feelings.We didn't question such things... What he is doing in his personal life, nobody asks before doing anything. I have come to know about it via the media only.""Lalu Prasad on Sunday expelled his eldest son from the party for six years, citing ignorance of ""moral values"" in his personal life. In a post on X, Lalu said Tej Pratap’s behaviour does not align with the family’s values and traditions.“Ignoring moral values in personal life weakens our collective struggle for social justice. The actions, public conduct, and irresponsible behavior of my eldest son are not in accordance with our family’s principles. Therefore, under these circumstances, I am removing him from the party and the family. Effective immediately, he will have no role of any kind in either. He is expelled from the party for six years,” Lalu Yadav wrote on X.“He is capable of judging what is right or wrong in his personal life. Those who choose to associate with him should make their own decisions. I have always supported accountability in public life, and obedient members of our family have upheld this principle,” he further added.The 37-year-old RJD leader had married Aishwarya Rai , granddaughter of former Bihar chief minister Daroga Rai, in a grand ceremony in 2018. But the marriage did not work out, and within months, Aishwarya left his home, accusing Tej Pratap and his family of mistreatment.The fallout led to a high-profile legal battle and political drama, with her father, former minister Chandrika Roy, quitting the RJD and vowing to fight for his daughter both ""politically and legally"".Their divorce proceedings remain active in the local family court. Both parties continue to make accusations. While Tej Pratap Yadav accused his wife of demanding a large alimony amount, Aishwarya alleged that he had troubling behaviour, claiming he took drugs and privately dressed like a woman.RJD leader Rohini Acharya also strongly backed her father and party chief Lalu Prasad Yadav’s decision to expel Tej Pratap Yadav from both the party and the family. The move comes in the wake of what she described as repeated breaches of family values and inappropriate public behaviour.Sharing her views on X, Rohini Acharya wrote, ""Those who take care of the dignity of the environment, tradition, family and upbringing are never questioned. Those who abandon their wisdom and repeatedly commit the mistake of crossing the limits of decent conduct and family prestige, they make themselves the subject of criticism.""Reiterating her unwavering support for Lalu Prasad Yadav and the ideals he stands for, she added, ""For us, Papa is like God, family is our temple and pride and the party built by Papa's tireless efforts and struggles, and the concept of social justice is our worship. We will never accept that the reputation of these three is tarnished due to anyone.""",Tej pratap yadav revealed on saturday that he has been in a relationship for the past 12 years.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, Union health minister and Bharatiya Janata Party chief JP Nadda pose for a picture with NDA CMs and deputy CMs during the National Democratic Alliance chief ministers and deputy chief ministers meeting, at Ashok Hotel in New Delhi on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday chaired a high-level meeting, which included top NDA leadership, including over 20 chief ministers and 18 deputy chief ministers, in New Delhi.The day-long session served as a platform to discuss good governance, national security, and inclusive development, culminating in two key resolutions -- one applauding the armed forces for Operation Sindoor and another endorsing the caste census initiative.Union home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, BJP chief JP Nadda, and several senior leaders participated in the meeting, which also marked the first anniversary of the Modi government's third term.The gathering paid tribute to the victims of the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack and focused on state-level innovations, with multiple chief ministers presenting their flagship schemes.Addressing a press conference after the meeting, JP Nadda, said: “Today, our National Democratic Alliance 's CM conclave was held under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi. Our 20 CMs and 18 deputy CMs were present in this meeting. Two resolutions were passed. The first resolution was on Operation Sindoor, which was carried out under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi and the work of our army was highly praised, and the bravery shown by the army was highly appreciated.”“Today, a resolution was also passed in the meeting on the caste census. And everyone has given their consent to this, as well as praised this decision of (PM) Modi and congratulated him. We have made it clear that we do not do caste politics, but want to bring the deprived, oppressed and exploited, who have been left out, into the mainstream. This is the need of the society,” Nadda added.Prime Minister Modi told the gathering that caste enumeration aligns with his government’s model of development aimed at integrating the marginalised and those left behind in every sector. He also noted that Operation Sindoor demonstrated the success of India’s indigenous defence capabilities, highlighting the precision and effectiveness of homegrown technology in confronting terrorism, reported news agency ANI.The resolution on caste enumeration was proposed by Haryana CM Nayab Saini, while the one lauding Operation Sindoor was introduced by Rajasthan CM Bhajanlal Sharma and seconded by Maharashtra deputy CM and Shiv Sena leader Eknath Shinde.The resolution stated that the operation, conducted in response to the April 22 terror attack , had ""boosted the self-confidence of Indians"" and gave ""a befitting reply to terrorists and their sponsors.""A significant part of the conclave was devoted to best practices by NDA state governments. Among the highlights was Chhattisgarh chief minister Vishnu Deo Sai’s presentation on the Bastar Olympics and Bastar Pandum, which drew special praise from Prime Minister Modi. Chhattisgarh deputy chief ministers Vijay Sharma and Arun Sao were also in attendance.BJP chief Nadda reiterated the alliance’s stance and said: ""The ruling National Democratic Alliance does not believe in caste politics but caste enumeration will help those left behind in different fields to develop.”","Prime minister narendra modi on sunday chaired a high-level meeting, which included top nda leadership.

NEW DELHI: Political strategist and Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor took a jab at Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday, following Kumar’s absence from the recent Niti Aayog meeting. Kishor questioned the CM's health, cognitive ability, and the political motivations behind his continued leadership.“Nitish Kumar didn’t attend the meeting as he is not physically and medically fit,” Kishor claimed while talking to reporters. He further criticized the CM for prioritizing political negotiations over development-focused discussions. “If you see it from another perspective, the CM of the poorest state, Bihar, didn’t attend the meeting, which was for development, but he has gone today (at NDA CMs and deputy CMs meeting) to bargain for more seats for JD(U) (in Bihar elections ),” he said.In a sharp personal dig, Kishor also questioned Kumar’s mental faculties and claiming the lack of accountability for those holding public office. “His mind is not working... A student from a common family has to take physical and medical tests to pass an examination, but the state's CM, who doesn't even remember his name, has no such rule for him,” he remarked.Kishor also targeted the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), accusing it of political opportunism.“BJP has imposed such a person on Bihar as they have 12 Lok Sabha seats and support in Bihar,” he saidd. He added that the BJP was compelled to project Nitish as the CM face ahead of elections due to strategic calculations.“It’s the BJP’s compulsion to keep Nitish Kumar as the CM face till election, as if they won’t do that, he will shift to the other side,” Kishor added.This comes as Bihar CM and key NDA ally Nitish Kumar was notably absent from the 10th Niti Aayog governing council meeting held in New Delhi on Saturday. He was amongst various leaders from opposition-governed states who did not attend the session. His non-attendance has sparked political discussions, particularly as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Bihar in advance of the state's assembly elections this year.His absence at the crucial meeting triggered discussions in political circles. Leaders from both Congress and RJD have expressed their disappointment, labelling it as ""unfortunate"" whilst suggesting potential underlying political implications.Read more: Bihar's Nitish Kumar joins non-NDA CMs in skipping Niti Aayog meet, sparks political buzz","Political strategist and jan suraaj founder prashant kishor took a jab at bihar chief minister nitish kumar.

""Students there have achieved 95% results in Class 10th exams, and in Class 12th results, Dantewada has secured sixth position in the entire state,"" he said, celebrating educational success in a region long overshadowed by conflict.His remarks came days after a top Maoist leader, Basavaraju, was killed in an encounter in Chhattisgarh - seen as a key moment in the continuing push to restore peace. Yet, beyond the security lens, Modi chose to emphasise everyday development as the true sign of change. ""This is not just a sign of development, but also of rising confidence,"" he said, referring to how residents of Katejhari village in Gadchiroli celebrated the launch of their first-ever bus service with drums and joy.""This is a new chapter of change in areas previously trapped in fear,"" he added.Modi underlined how tribal children were now exploring science labs and competing in large events like Bastar Olympics.

Unfortunately, even the victim has turned turtle from her earlier statement.""The judge also pointed out three key lapses by the investigating officer (IO) which led to the acquittal.

"Tej Pratap: Rebel without cause, felled by poll cause",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tej-pratap-rebel-without-cause-felled-by-poll-cause/articleshow/121398999.cms,"PATNA: In Bihar's complex political theatre, few figures are as erratic, unpredictable and, at times, bewildering as Tej Pratap Yadav , elder son of RJD chief Lalu Prasad . Once introduced as a rising heir to his father's legacy, Tej Pratap has evolved into a political liability, a family outcast, and, most curiously, a man whose personal whims have routinely overshadowed the party's agenda.This election year in Bihar, Tej Pratap has become the proverbial thorn in Lalu's side, a distraction the veteran socialist could no longer ignore. On Saturday, Tej Pratap again seized headlines, not for strategy or statesmanship, but for posting on social media about a new ""relation"" with a woman. The announcement was casual, dramatic and ambiguous, a pattern now familiar to those who have followed his journey over the past decade.While dynastic politics in the country often comes with high expectations, Tej Pratap never seemed to settle into the role. His early appearances as state health minister in 2015 - more notable for clumsy media interactions than policy achievements - left many wondering whether he was suited for public life at all. Reports of him consulting astrologers for state matters and allegedly bringing a cow into his ministerial bungalow for ""positive energy"" became tabloid fodder and marked the beginning of a reputation built more on eccentricity than governance.Tej Pratap's dramatic personal life has also been central to his public persona. His 2018 marriage to Aishwarya Rai, granddaughter of former CM Daroga Rai, was supposed to cement a powerful political alliance. Instead, it turned into a scandal. Within months, he filed for divorce, alleging domestic discord, while Aishwarya accused him of abuse and erratic behaviour.Family tensions spilled into public view as Lalu and Rabri Devi struggled to contain the fallout. In one infamous episode, Tej Pratap declared he was going on a pilgrimage to escape ""toxic atmosphere"" of home. His tantrums did not stop there. He often skipped key party events, launched public tirades against younger brother Tejashwi Prasad Yadav , now firmly established as Lalu's political heir, and floated vague threats of forming his own political outfit.Saturday's post, just months before assembly elections, appears to be another in a long line of personal dramas staged in public view.In a rare but decisive step, Lalu Prasad finally acted. Tej Pratap was formally expelled from RJD and disowned by family. The message was clear - political survival trumps paternal indulgence.","Tej pratap yadav has evolved into a political liability, a family outcast, and a man whose personal whims have routinely overshadowed the party's agenda.
