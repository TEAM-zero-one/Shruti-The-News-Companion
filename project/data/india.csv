Chhattisgarh HC: No automatic bail for juveniles in heinous crimes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-no-automatic-bail-for-juveniles-in-heinous-crimes/articleshow/128586839.cms,"Chhattisgarh HC

Raipur: Chhattisgarh HC has dismissed a juvenile's appeal for bail in a 2025 murder case , saying such relief can't be treated as an absolute or automatic rig-ht and release will ""defeat the ends of justice"" given the gravity of the offence.Justice Arvind Kumar Verma upheld earlier orders of Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) and a sessions court in Chhattisgarh's Dhamtari, and held the HC was ""not convinced"" that a juvenile could claim bail without courts examining the nature of the offence.""JJB and the sessions court rightly prioritised child protection over routine bail in a heinous offence like murder. Such acts amount to a grave rupture of social order, violate the inherent dignity of childhood, and demand collective vigilance to restore moral balance,"" Justice Verma observed in his Feb 13 judgment.The minor filed the criminal revision plea under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, challenging the order of the sessions court on Oct 31, 2025 rejecting bail. He allegedly stabbed Vikas Dhruv in Dhamtari following an altercation on June 6 last year.The minor's counsel argued that the lower courts had failed to appreciate the reformative spirit of the 2015 law, and continued detention in an observation home would expose him to criminal influence. The counsel said the attack occurred in self-defence and that the accused had no prior criminal records and came from a poor family.Govt counsel Vivek Sharma contended that the lower courts had properly assessed the evidence, highlighting the serious nature of the crime.","Chhattisgarh hc has dismissed a juvenile's appeal for bail in a 2025 murder case.

New Delhi: Jolted by allegations of anti-Brahmin bias, FIRs and court petitions, the producer of 'Ghooskhor Pandat' on Thursday filed an affidavit informing Supreme Court of the decision to withdraw the film's title and not use the words that had hurt the sentiments of a section of society anywhere in the Manoj Bajpayee-starrer.Senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul, appearing for producer Neeraj Pandey , told a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan that given the concerns expressed over the teaser since its release on Feb 3, the promotional material had been withdrawn.He said the film was a fictional police drama that revolved around a criminal investigation without portraying any caste, religion, community or sect as corrupt.In his affidavit, Pandey said, ""I respectfully submit that the earlier title, 'Ghooskhor Pandat', stands unequivocally withdrawn and shall not be used in any manner whatsoever.

Parents' qualification doesn't matter in custody battle: Calcutta HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parents-qualification-doesnt-matter-in-custody-battle-calcutta-hc/articleshow/128586587.cms,"Calcutta HC

Kolkata: The child of a separated couple who has been living with his father for five years cannot be ""planted som-ewhere else"" even if the father's educational qualification is less than the mother's, Calcutta HC held on Tuesday.The mother, who was recently awarded custody of the child by a trial court, has a master's in music. She runs a music school and is also a private tutor. The father, whose custody claim over the 8-year-old has been upheld by the high court, is a matriculate and earns a living selling fish.The child, who has been living with his father since the couple separated five years ago, had told the trial court judge that he wanted to stay with both parents.Since the couple filed for restitution of conjugal rights several times while the custody battle was on, a HC division bench of Justices Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya and Supratim Bhattacharya observed on Tuesday: ""It transpires that all is still not lost and there is ample scope for the parties reconciling their matrimonial disputes, as well as a chance of the parties staying together as a couple by shedding their personal differences, which will be of utmost benefit to the child in the final count.The bench referred the couple for mediation, to be supervised by the Calcutta HC mediation committee. The committee was requested to include a psychologist in the mediation.The trial court in a recent order had noted that the father earned more than the mother but awarded custody to the mother on the grounds that she was more educated. The judge had observed that the child's upbringing would be affected if he were to be deprived of his mother's love.Acting on an appeal by the father against the trial court order, the division bench observed on Tuesday: ""The finding of the trial judge is that any detachment of the minor from his mother may cause a scratch in the mind of the minor, who is eight years old. That scratch was caused five years ago; from age three to eight, he has been residing with his father... He has been living with his father for five years; now we cannot pick him up and plant him somewhere else. ""The bench also observed: ""The trial judge was swayed more by personal inclinations and views than the facts of the case.""The couple separated in 2021, when the child was just three. The man has alleged that his wife left to live at her paternal home, while the woman claimed she had been driven out of the house by her husband.The division bench said no evidence was provided to establish that the child's education suffered during the five years he was with his father. Rather, it was noted that the child is being tutored by his aunt and two private tutors.The mother has been granted visitation rights by the high court.","Calcutta hc says the child of a separated couple cannot be ""planted som-ewhere else"" the mother, who was recently awarded custody of the child by a trial court, has a master's in music.

INDORE: Displaying striking indifference during a crime scene reconstruction, the accused in the murder of a 24-year-old MBA student reacted casually when questioned by reporters, brushing aside queries about the killing.Surrounded by media personnel on Tuesday, Piyush Dhamnodiya shrugged off questions about the motive behind the murder. “Kuch nai hua hai, chhodo, ho gaya jo hogaya yaar… chhod do na… kya karoge jaan ke,” he said in Hindi, refusing to explain his actions. When asked whether he regretted the crime, he responded with a faint smirk and said he would reveal the reason “when the time comes”.Police officials present at the reconstruction described his demeanour as unusually calm. Officers said his behaviour during interrogation and subsequent proceedings appeared erratic and detached.According to investigators, the accused allegedly muttered apologies in the hours following the crime and claimed he wanted to “communicate with the victim’s spirit”. He also told police he had contemplated suicide by jumping in front of a train but did not act on it.During questioning at the Dwarkapuri police station, Dhamnodiya reportedly asked for a blank sheet of paper and wrote that he had committed a “grave wrong” and wanted to die.He repeatedly requested officers to let him meet the victim, claiming he loved her.DCP Krishna Lalchandani said the accused had been consuming occult-related online content and searching for suicide methods, though he never attempted self-harm. Investigators also learned that Dhamnodiya suspected the victim of speaking to other men.Police said the woman’s body was recovered on Feb 13 from a rented room in Indore, three days after she was reported missing. Dhamnodiya, identified as her boyfriend and classmate, was traced to Mumbai and arrested from Andheri on Feb 14.During interrogation, police alleged that Dhamnodiya tied the victim’s hands and legs, gagged her and strangled her. Officers further claimed he later purchased beer, returned to the room and consumed alcohol beside the body. Investigators accused him of sexually assaulting the corpse and engaging in acts of necrophilia before fleeing.Police said the accused travelled by train after leaving Indore, changing routes before reaching Mumbai. Investigators stated he later went to a deserted location near Panvel, where he allegedly lit incense sticks and watched online videos about summoning spirits.Dwarkapuri police seized items linked to the crime and recreated the scene. The accused is scheduled to be produced before a court on Wednesday.",Piyush dhamnodiya shrugged off questions about the motive behind the murder.

ROHTAK: The murder of a 27-year-old bank employee, found with her throat slit near Bahadurgarh in Jhajjar district, was solved within 18 hours, with police arresting her husband — a chartered accountant from Hisar — as the prime accused.Investigators said the accused killed his wife over repeated suspicions about her character and then attempted to pass it off as a robbery-cum-murder.The victim, Mahak, worked with HDFC Bank in Gurgaon.She was married to Anshul Dhawan, a chartered accountant and resident of Hisar’s Sector 14, on September 25, 2025, in an arranged marriage. The couple had been married for barely five months.On Valentine’s Day (February 14), the couple visited Hisar and stayed with family.The next evening, around 7 pm on February 15, they left Mahak’s parental home in Hansi for Gurugram. About four hours later, Anshul called the police, claiming unidentified attackers had intercepted their car near Pahsaur village in the Badli area of Jhajjar district, killed his wife, and fled.Police found Mahak’s body lying outside the car on a dirt track about 100 metres off the Jhajjar-Badli road. Her throat had been slit.However, Anshul’s version soon fell apart during questioning. He failed to describe the alleged attackers and repeatedly changed his statement.During sustained interrogation and a crime scene reconstruction, Anshul confessed. Police said the couple frequently argued over his suspicions about Mahak’s character. The dispute escalated during the drive, leading him to first strangle her and then slit her throat with a pair of scissors, allegedly while wearing gloves to avoid leaving evidence. He later staged the scene to resemble a robbery.Mahak’s father, Krishna Kathuria, had expressed suspicion against his son-in-law from the outset. Family members also stated that Mahak was pregnant at the time of her death.Police have arrested the accused and are proceeding with further investigation.","The victim, mahak, worked with hdfc bank in gurgaon.

In the 288-member Maharashtra assembly, Sena UBT has 20 legislators, followed by Congress (16) and NCP (SP) (10).""If you look at the figures, the (RS polls) seat belongs to Sena UBT, and talks will definitely happen in that direction in MVA,"" Aaditya said.EC is set to officially notify polls for seven Rajya Sabha seats, scheduled for March 16, on Feb 26.

Imphal/Churachandpur: A fractured state tried to talk to itself. For the first time since ethnic violence tore Manipur apart in May 2023, chief minister Yumnam Khemchand Singh addressed on Thursday displaced Meitei and Kuki-Zo families together - on a shared platform, if only virtually - pairing cash relief with an appeal to rebuild trust.The outreach, anchored at a relief camp in Langol of Imphal West district, connected displaced Meitei families in the valley with Kuki-Zo inmates of camps in Churachandpur and Kangpokpi via video link. Direct benefit transfers were credited during the meet.Each displaced person received Rs 2,420 for essentials. Families whose homes were burnt are being paid Rs 1 lakh in instalments, officials said.More than 260 people have been killed and over 60,000 displaced since clashes erupted between Meitei and Kuki communities in 2023. Since then, movement has been sharply curtailed - valley residents rarely enter Kuki-majority hills, and Kukis seldom travel into Imphal.Singh said resettlement had begun in peripheral areas, but restoring homes in sensitive zones remained difficult. ""Resettling IDPs (internally displaced persons) to their original places is a priority, though challenges remain. While tensions have eased, mistrust continues,"" he said, urging social groups and families to help bridge the divide.It was a modest step - cheques and promises - but the first time the state tried to stitch two wounded communities into the same conversation.

A Meitei woman broke down, pleading to return home after three years in a camp.

Why SC flagged freebies

Concern over impact on work culture &finances

Court issues notice but clarifies wider concern

Freebies: New currency of political power?

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday raised serious concerns over the growing culture of 'freebies' across states , warning that indiscriminate distribution of such benefits could hamper economic development and strain state finances. The top court also cautioned states and asked whether such a culture, without drawing a distinction between the haves and the have-nots, would amount to an ""appeasing policy.""Hearing a plea by Tamil Nadu Power Distribution Ltd, which plans to provide free electricity to all consumers regardless of their financial status, the court said welfare measures are justified for the poor, but extending them to everyone could weaken development efforts.A bench led by Chief Justice India Surya Kant, along with Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi, pointed out that many states already face revenue deficits yet continue to announce large-scale free schemes.“Most of the states in the country are revenue deficit states and yet they are offering such freebies” overlooking development, the bench said.The judges stressed that excessive spending on freebies could slow economic progress and reduce funds available for infrastructure, jobs, and long-term growth.""The economic development of the nation will be hampered by this kind of largesse distribution. Yes, it is the State's duty to provide, but the ones who are enjoying freebies... is it not something that should be looked at?"" Chief Justice of India Surya Kant verbally observed.The CJI also questioned whether states were using their revenue wisely.""States are running into deficit but still giving freebies. See, 25 per cent of the revenue you collect in a year, why can it not be used for the development of the State?""The bench warned that indiscriminate distribution of benefits could affect productivity and reduce incentives to work.“What kind of culture are we developing in India? It is understandable that as part of the welfare measure you want to provide to those who are incapable of pay the electricity charges,” the bench asked.“But without drawing a distinction between those who can afford and those who cannot, you start distributing. Will it not amount to an appeasing policy,” the CJI asked.The court also questioned the timing of the Tamil Nadu power firm’s proposal.“The states should work to open avenues for employment. If you start giving free food from morning to evening then free cycle, then free electricity then who will work and then what will happen to the work culture,” the CJI said.JusticeBagchi added that states must properly justify such spending in their budgets.""It's not one State we are talking about, it's about all States. It is planned expenditure. Why don't you make Budget proposals and give justification that this is my outlay on unemployment of people?""Despite its sharp observations, the Suprme Court issued notice to the Centre and other parties on the petition filed by the DMK government-run power utility challenging electricity rules.The court clarified that its concern was not limited to Tamil Nadu but applied to all states offering similar schemes without proper financial planning.A report by Aequitas Investments noted that freebies have increasingly become a major electoral strategy.""As political parties compete in what appears to be a race to the bottom, welfare schemes and 'freebies' have evolved from mere campaign promises to the new currency of political power,"" the report said.","Supreme court raises serious concerns over the growing culture of 'freebies' across states.

NEW DELHI: Mere awareness drives or campaigns will not be enough to reduce violations of road traffic rules and road crashes; rather, the “certainty of enforcement” will have a greater deterrent impact, Union road transport secretary V Umashankar said on Thursday while sharing details of the recently notified e-challan rules.Speaking at the release of the New Delhi Road Safety Declaration at the National Road Safety Confluence held at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Umashankar questioned whether a juvenile (referring to a recent case in Delhi) did not know that he was underage and should not have been driving a car, or whether the vehicle owner who modified a tourist bus — resulting in the deaths of more than 20 people in a fire — did not know that such modifications were illegal.“Forty-five percent of fatalities involve two-wheelers or people riding two-wheelers. We find that most of these deaths occurred because the rider was not wearing a helmet. Does he not know that wearing a helmet is good for him?” he observed. Umashankar said, “Awareness is not enough — what we need is organised, district-level action, backed by certainty of enforcement and supported by strong institutions. When compliance becomes a habit and accountability becomes certain, road safety will move from intention to impact.Mats-Ake Belin, global lead for the Decade of Action for Road Safety at the World Health Organization, said that road safety is now firmly on the global agenda, with strong political and media attention. “Our responsibility is to move beyond awareness and ensure consistent, evidence-based implementation so that no country is left behind in preventing road traffic deaths,” he added.The New Delhi Road Safety Declaration, aligned with the WHO Decade of Action for Road Safety, states that India records the highest number of road fatalities globally, with vulnerable road users — such as pedestrians, cyclists, two-wheeler riders, gig workers, and rural communities — being the most affected. Despite several initiatives, the absence of coordinated, institution-led action has limited national impact. “The declaration addresses this gap by adopting a Safe System approach, placing human life at the centre of all mobility decisions,” it said.The declaration, spearheaded by the Bharat Association of Road Safety Volunteers (BARS), an organisation comprising members from diverse fields, has set five pillars of action: strengthening road safety management through leadership at all levels; promoting open crash data, annual public reviews, dedicated funding, and enhanced enforcement; ensuring safer vehicles and fleets; promoting safer road users and improved post-crash response; and creating a safer driving environment.Participants included representatives from ministries, WHO and other multilateral agencies, civil society, academia, industry bodies, OEMs, technology innovators, and youth groups.","V umashankar: what we need is organised, district-level action, backed by certainty of enforcement and supported by strong institutions. “when compliance becomes a habit and accountability becomes certain, road safety will move from intention to impact,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128575122,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-17756,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Why did it explode into controversy



BJP activists protest against Maharashtra Congress chief Harshwardhan Sapkal's remarks equating Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj with Tipu Sultan outside Congress Bhavan, in Pune.

From portrait to protests



Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis pays tribute to the greatest king, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at Shivtirtha, Ichalkaranji, in Kolhapur.

History does not always stay in textbooks. Sometimes, it returns framed on a wall. In Malegaon, a portrait of the 18th-century Mysore ruler Tipu Sultan , briefly placed inside the office of a newly-elected deputy mayor, triggered a political controversy that has travelled far beyond the municipal corporation building where it began.Within 48 hours, the image was removed by the civic administration, the matter escalated into a war of words between Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and state Congress chief Harshwardhan Sapkal, protests broke out in multiple cities, and eight people were injured in stone pelting in Pune.At the centre of the row was not merely the presence of Tipu Sultan’s portrait but Sapkal’s statement comparing him with Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as belonging “to the same league of valour”. The chief minister described the comparison as “unacceptable” and said the Congress politician should be “ashamed”. What followed was a familiar pattern in Indian public life where history, memory, symbolism and contemporary political positioning intersect.The controversy began after Shiv Sena corporators in Malegaon objected to the display of Tipu Sultan’s portrait in deputy mayor Shaan-e-Hind Nihal Ahmed’s office.A delegation met Malegaon civic chief Ravindra Jadhav, demanding that it be removed and warning of an agitation if the administration failed to act. The Malegaon Municipal Corporation on Saturday removed the portrait from the office.Jadhav confirmed that the administration examined the state government’s official protocol list, which outlines leaders whose anniversaries are observed and whose portraits are permitted for display in government offices, before taking the action. “Tipu Sultan’s name is not included in the list. Therefore, the portrait was removed from the deputy mayor’s office,” MMC officials said.Ahmed, however, defended the figure’s historical relevance. “Tipu Sultan fought against the British and was acknowledged for his bravery at that time. There are roads named after him in Mumbai and Nagpur. This is an attempt to divert attention from our work. Some people are unable to digest that two Muslim women are mayor and deputy mayor in Malegaon,” she told reporters.When asked about the controversy, Sapkal, speaking in Buldhana on Saturday, said, “He (Tipu Sultan) waged a war against the British and was a brave warrior. He was a son of the soil. He never entertained poisonous or divisive thoughts. We should view Tipu Sultan as an equal to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as a symbol of bravery,” he said.CM Fadnavis called the comparison unacceptable. Congress “should be ashamed of equating the founder of Hindavi Swarajya with Tipu Sultan, who butchered 1,000s of Hindus,” he said.The episode reopened an older historical debate that has periodically entered political discourse as both figures occupy significant but very different spaces in Indian history.Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, born in 1630, is widely regarded as the founder of the Maratha state and the architect of Hindavi Swarajya. His military campaigns against the Mughal Empire and regional sultanates laid the foundation for a political formation that eventually expanded into one of the most powerful empires in early modern India.Shivaji’s legacy in Maharashtra is not confined to historical admiration alone. He represents resistance, self-rule, regional pride, and a warrior ethos deeply embedded in the state’s socio-political consciousness.Tipu Sultan, born in 1751, ruled the Kingdom of Mysore during a period of intense conflict between Indian polities and the expanding British East India Company. Alongside his father, Hyder Ali, he waged multiple wars against British forces and is remembered in several accounts as one of the earliest rulers to adopt modern military technologies such as iron-cased rockets.In 1799, Tipu Sultan died fighting the British during the siege of Srirangapatna.For many historians, Tipu Sultan’s significance lies in his sustained resistance to colonial expansion. For others, particularly in regions such as parts of Karnataka and Kerala, he remains a contested figure due to accounts of forced conversions, temple desecrations and harsh campaigns against certain communities.The debate over his rule has persisted for decades and has often been shaped by political context as much as archival evidence. These differing interpretations have given Tipu Sultan a complex afterlife in contemporary politics.In Maharashtra, Shivaji Maharaj occupies an almost sacred position across ideological lines, but particularly within the political vocabulary of the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) and Shiv Sena.The Maratha ruler is frequently invoked as a symbol of indigenous sovereignty, martial pride and cultural assertion. References to Hindavi Swarajya resonate strongly with narratives centred on civilisational identity and self-determination.Any perceived attempt to equate Shivaji Maharaj with another historical figure, especially one whose legacy is contested, therefore carries political sensitivity.BJP leaders have argued that comparisons diminish the unique historical role of Shivaji Maharaj. BJP Pune city president Dheeraj Ghate said, “Sapkal’s remarks deeply hurt the sentiments of all those who idolise Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as a deity. It is a deliberate attempt to create a rift in society.”For the Congress, Tipu Sultan has at times represented anti-colonial resistance and an inclusive strand of historical nationalism. In southern states, especially Karnataka, Congress governments have celebrated Tipu Jayanti, framing him as a freedom fighter who resisted British rule.Political opponents, particularly from the BJP and allied organisations, have long argued that such commemorations reflect an attempt at minority outreach, with the emphasis on Tipu’s anti-British legacy seen by them as part of a broader effort to counter the rise of Hindutva-centred historical narratives.This divergence in emphasis reflects deeper ideological differences in how the past is mobilised in present day politics. While the BJP’s political messaging often foregrounds civilisational continuity and indigenous cultural pride aligned with Hindutva thought, the Congress has tended to promote pluralist interpretations of history that critics frequently characterise as accommodative or appeasement-driven in their political intent.The political undertone of invoking either figure is therefore significant. Shivaji Maharaj serves as a unifying icon in Maharashtra, but also as a potent symbol within a wider discourse on identity, sovereignty and cultural resurgence associated with Hindutva politics.Tipu Sultan, by contrast, often becomes a focal point in debates where his remembrance is interpreted by critics through the prism of Muslim appeasement versus majoritarian assertions of historical identity.The controversy in Malegaon quickly spread beyond the initial administrative decision. BJP and right organisation supporters protested in Nagpur, Nashik, Ahilyanagar, Sangli, Solapur, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Nanded, Latur and elsewhere. In Pune, Patit Pawan Sanghatana members were the first to assemble in front of the Congress Bhawan on Sunday morning, condemning Sapkal's remarks.Around 12.30 pm, BJP workers, including mayor Manjusha Nagpure, reached the site and started sloganeering and showing posters. By then, about 100 Congress workers reached the site and started raising counter slogans.“As the sloganeering was on from both sides, someone hurled a stone. This set off stone pelting by members from either side,” additional commissioner of police Manoj Patil said. “Two women constables, two reporters and two workers each from BJP and Congress were injured. “The nature of injuries was not serious,” he said.As political leaders weighed in, the debate widened. AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi defended Tipu Sultan, saying, “In 1799, Tipu Sultan died fighting the British,” and added, “He did not sit in jail and write love letters to the British.”Meanwhile, Telangana BJP president N Ramchander Rao said by glorifying Tipu Sultan, the AIMIM “is distorting history”.Amid mounting criticism, Sapkal later clarified his remarks. “My statement was misinterpreted by the BJP for political benefits. I said that there cannot be anyone like Shivaji Maharaj, and Tipu Sultan took inspiration from him.” He subsequently expressed regret, saying, “I did not say anything wrong about Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The question of comparison does not arise; I did not make one.”He described Shivaji Maharaj as ""my ideal, my inspiration and my pride,"" and appealed for calm. “If any Shiv devotees' sentiments were hurt because of misuse of my words, I sincerely express regret. It was never my intention to hurt anyone's feelings. Let us put this matter to rest here.”Yet, the episode illustrates how historical figures continue to function as political signifiers in contemporary India. Portraits in public offices are rarely neutral. They signal not only admiration but also affiliation, narrative and sometimes ideological positioning.As demonstrations spread and leaders traded charges over historical interpretation, the controversy showed no immediate sign of abating. What began as the placement of a portrait has become a reminder that in Indian politics, the past remains an active participant in the present. The images on the wall often speak as loudly as the speeches delivered beneath them.",A portrait of 18th-century mysore ruler tipu sultan was briefly placed inside the office of a newly-elected deputy mayor in malegaon.

SRINAGAR: Operations were suspended at the 450MW stage 1 Baglihar hydropower project on the Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir after it got flooded two days ago.As water entered the project’s machine room, engineers immediately halted power generation to prevent damage to critical electro-mechanical components. The project, located in Ramban district, is a major contributor to the region’s power supply. As the project’s stage 1 remains suspended, stage 2 which adds another 450 MW capacity, will be operational. It has not been impacted by the flooding, officials said.A senior official called it minor flooding which happened during scheduled maintenance. Stage 1 was anyway scheduled to remain closed for three months for repair works, the official said. “Since stage 1 has to stay shut for 90 days, we will operate stage 2 during the period,” he said.The official said stage 1 typically runs at full load for seven to eight months and at partial load for three to four months annually. Stage 2, however, operates only for about four months, from July to Sept, as per design, as there is not enough discharge to run both stages simultaneously during lean period. “Now that stage 1 is shut down for repairs, we will run stage 2, which otherwise remains closed during the lean period,” he said.","The 450mw stage 1 baglihar hydropower project on the chenab river in jammu and kashmir got flooded two days ago.

NEW DELHI: Fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya on Wednesday informed the Bombay high court that he cannot specify when he will return to India as he is legally barred from leaving the United Kingdom.In a statement submitted through his counsel Amit Desai, Mallya said that he does not have an active Indian passport and is also restrained by court orders in England and Wales from travelling outside the UK.The submission came after a bench of Chief Justice Shree Chandrashekhar and Justice Gautam Ankhad last week made it clear that it would not hear his plea challenging the order declaring him a fugitive economic offender unless he returns to India.The court had asked Mallya to clarify whether he intended to come back to the country.Mallya, who has been based in the UK since leaving India in March 2016, has filed two petitions before the high court, one challenging the order declaring him a fugitive economic offender and another questioning the constitutional validity of the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act.In his statement read out in court, Mallya said that he cannot give a definite date for his return as his passport was revoked by the Indian government in 2016 and because courts in England and Wales have prohibited him from leaving the country.“Mallya is not permitted to leave or attempt to leave England and Wales or apply for or be in possession of any international travel document. In any event, the petitioner is unable to precisely state when he will return to India,” Desai read out from the statement.The senior counsel further argued that Mallya’s physical presence in India was not necessary for the court to hear his pleas against the fugitive tag and the provisions of the Act.“If he (Mallya) were to appear in India, then all these proceedings would be rendered irrelevant as the statute says that once the offender appears in the concerned court of law, then all these orders would be set aside,” Desai told the court.Mallya, 70, faces multiple cases of alleged fraud and money laundering linked to the default of loans amounting to several thousand crores. He was declared a Fugitive Economic Offender in January 2019 by a special court hearing cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.The high court has directed the Union government to file its reply to Mallya’s statement and posted the matter for further hearing next month.",Vijay mallya tells bombay high court that he cannot specify when he will return to india.

The reasons cited by the trial court to reject cognisance were ""patently perverse"", he said.Last year, HC issued notice to the Gandhis and others on ED's main petition, along with its application seeking a stay on the trial court's Dec 16 order. That order held cognisance of the agency's prosecution complaint was ""impermissible in law"" because it was not founded on an FIR.

New Delhi: More than six years after its enactment sparked riots in Delhi, the Supreme Court on Thursday scheduled a four-day final hearing from May 5 on 243 petitions challenging the validity of Citizenship (Amendment) Act that provides a pathway for citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis and Christians who may reach India after fleeing religious persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi said the petitioners, that include Muslim organisations among which Indian Union of Muslim League has been termed the lead petitioner, and functionaries from Congress, TMC and AIMIM, would conclude their arguments within one and half days and the Centre would respond in a similar time frame. May 12 has been kept for rejoinders to be filed by petitioners.On Dec 18, 2019, a three-judge bench, which included Justice Kant, had issued notice to the Centre on the petitions challenging CAA on the ground of discrimination against Muslims who came to India from neighbouring countries but were not entitled to citizenship under CAA.Protesters, mainly Muslim women supported by political parties, had blocked a major arterial road in Shaheen Bagh here from Dec 15, 2019 till March 24, 2020.Blockades were organised in other parts of the city too. The resultant tension triggered riots in northeast Delhi on Feb 23, 2020 that lasted several days and left 53 dead.SC had last heard the petitions on March 19, 2024, the year the Centre framed Citizenship (Amendment) Rules. The Centre had filed its response to the petitions in Oct 2022 and termed CAA a benign piece of legislation providing Indian citizenship to members of those communities who have been persecuted for the last 70 years in the three neighbouring Islamic countries of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.Countering the plea that CAA discriminated against Muslims, the Centre had said, ""CAA does not seek to recognise or seek to provide answers to all or any kind of purported persecution that may be taking place across the world or that may have taken place previously anywhere in the world.""On Thursday, the bench agreed with solicitor general Tushar Mehta that the challenge to CAA in relation to Assam and Tripura, where separate accords set deadlines for entry of migrants from Bangladesh, could be de-linked from the ones which have questioned the law from a pan-India perspective.","Citizenship (amendment) act provides pathway for citizenship to hindus, sikhs, jains, parsis and christians who may reach india after fleeing religious persecution in pakistan, bangladesh and afghanistan.
