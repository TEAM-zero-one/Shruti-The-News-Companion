'Earthworm same as urea': Amit Shah bats for natural farming,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/earthworm-same-as-urea-amit-shah-bats-for-natural-farming/articleshow/122353909.cms,"Amit Shah interacts with women cooperative workers of Gujarat, MP & Rajasthan, in Ahmedabad Wednesday

NEW DELHI: Union home and cooperation minister Amit Shah has pitched for expanding the footprints of natural farming in the country, saying it is not only good for human health but also for the health of 'Mother Earth'.""Eating food produced without use of fertilisers and chemicals will keep you away from doctors and medicines. Apart from this, production increases with natural farming,"" Shah said during an interaction with women associated with cooperative sectors of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The programme was held in Ahmedabad on July 5 to mark the International Cooperatives Day and was telecast Wednesday.Citing his own example, Shah said he adopted natural farming in his fields and has seen an increase of one and a half times in production.""If natural farming is adopted, then earthworm does the same work as done by urea and other fertilisers such as DAP and NPK. Earthworms eat soil and make manure in the process. The land is not harmed in the process. Besides, water is also saved and people also remain healthy,"" said the minister.He said his ministry has already formed a national-level cooperative institution for the purchase of grains produced through natural farming. ""Apart from this, a cooperative society has also been formed for the export of farmers' crops and arrangements have been made to send the profit from export directly to the farmer's bank account,"" added Shah.","Union home and cooperation minister amit shah has pitched for expanding the footprints of natural farming in the country.

It's Janaki V: Makers agree to rephrase film title after censor board objections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/its-janaki-v-makers-agree-to-rephrase-film-title-after-censor-board-objections/articleshow/122353760.cms,"Representative image

KOCHI: The production company of the movie 'JSK - Janaki v/s State of Kerala', starring Union minister of state Suresh Gopi , agreed Wednesday to rephrase its title by adding the initial 'V' to the name, as suggested by Central Board of Film Certification CBFC also agreed to mute or edit the word 'Janaki' in two scenes, thereby ending legal tussle over the movie.The bench of Justice N Nagaresh accordingly directed the petitioners, Cosmos Entertainments, to submit the modified version of the film for certification. CBFC has been instructed to issue a censor certificate within three days of the submission.CBFC had informed HC that permitting films such as 'JSK - Janaki vs State of Kerala', in which lead character is portrayed as a rape victim bearing the name of a revered deity like Goddess Sita/Janaki, raises serious concerns regarding public order.CBFC made these remarks in a counter-affidavit filed as part of the legal battle related to the film. The affidavit stated that allowing such films to be publicly exhibited would set a dangerous precedent and open a 'Pandora's Box' for future productions.According to the affidavit, the lead character Janaki is shown to be sexually assaulted in the film. The film further portrays Janaki being cross-examined in court, where defence counsel subjects her to several humiliating questions.CBFC argued that posing such provocative questions to a character bearing the revered deity's name could disrupt public order and offend religious sentiments. Moreover, it pointed out that following the rape, Janaki is aided by a man from a particular religious community, while she is cross-examined and asked harrowing questions by a person from another community. This religious dichotomy in the treatment of a character named after Goddess Sita, it was contended, has potential to inflame communal tensions. CBFC emphasised that the determination of whether a film tends to disrupt public order must be made from perspective of an average moral person - someone of ordinary common sense and prudence - not through the lens of an individual completely indifferent to religious sentiments.The affidavit also cited the details of the themes of other films using divine names, including Janaki Jane, Sita Ramam (Telugu), Kallanum Bhagavathiyum and Malikappuram, and referenced prior instances where film titles were modified, such as Sexy Durga becoming S. Durga, Laxmmi Bomb changed to Laxmii and Loveratri to Loveyatri. CBFC also noted that the petitioner had not claimed that the film's substance, theme, or intended social commentary would be compromised by changing the title or the name.","Cbfc had informed hc that permitting films such as 'jsk - janaki vs state of kerala', in which lead character is portrayed as a rape victim bearing the name of a revered deity like goddess sita/janaki, raises serious concerns regarding public order.

"Bihar SIR: Electoral revision process shows Urban-rural divide; Aadhaar accepted in Patna, not in Seemanchal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-sir-aadhaar-accepted-in-patna-not-in-seemanchal/articleshow/122350645.cms,"Representative image

Aadhaar not valid here

PATNA: The special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar has gained pace with 57% (4.5 crore) of the 7.89 crore enrolled voters submitting their enumeration forms by Wednesday. But the process seems to have thrown up an urban-rural divide, TOI found after speaking to officials and people across regions. While officials were seen taking forms on basis of Aadhaar cards in Patna, not many were willing to accept the card in Seemanchal and other parts of rural Bihar, where birth certificates or, in lieu, caste or land allotment documents were being insisted on.TOI hit the ground for a reality check and found that booth level officers (BLOs), Jeevika didis, shiksha mitras and Anganwadi sevikas distributing enumeration forms in villages and towns of Bihar at a rapid pace.In Patna and adjoining areas, voters said they have been asked to fill in and sign the forms and submit a copy of their voter ID cards, Aadhaar, or even ration cards, if they don't have any of the 11 documents required by the Election Commission.Don’t worry, just provide your Aadhaar card,” Rahul Yadav , a ward councillor, was seen telling a group of worried women.Aadhaar and ration cards are not included in the list of 11 documents mandated by the EC, triggering widespread protests from the opposition India Bloc.But, in reality, some BLOs in urban areas like Patna say they have been asked to just get the enumeration forms filled in and signed by existing voters and upload them as the EC itself says the other needed documents can be submitted later. July 25 is the last date to submit forms.Ramashish, of Bikram area in Patna district, said the BLOs distributing the forms had initially asked them to submit the documents listed by the EC.“Since very few people had any of the 11 listed documents, the villagers were reluctant. But now they have been asked to just fill the columns of mother, father, spouse names, Aadhaar card number and mobile number with signature. That may be the reason why the SIR exercise has gained pace in the last few days,” he said.Many voters enrolled in urban areas of East Champaran district are getting their names added to the voter lists of their respective villages where they have landed property, revealed BLOs in Motihari, Raxaul, Sugauli, Areraj and Chakiya.Shiwani, a teacher at Urvarak Nagar in Begusarai, said, “The BLO asked for my voter ID and Aadhaar cards and I faced no difficulty.” Kalyanesh Agrawal of Chatti Road locality in Begusarai said the verification process was smooth.Awadhesh Kumar Singh, principal of SBSS College, Begusarai, said the BLO visited his house and the process was conducted without hassle.In Patna, people were seen at Jan Suvidha Kendras in their areas to get their forms filled. Former councillor Bharti Devi said there was confusion among people about the documents required. “But we are getting the forms filled to submit them to the BLO,” she said.Born in 1949, Dukhani Devi of Mushari Tola feared her name would be struck off the voter list. “Some people in my area said I will not be allowed to vote if I do not submit some papers. I only have an Aadhaar card and voter ID card. Will I be removed from my hut,” she asked. She was told that for now an Aadhaar would do, bringing a smile to her face.However, the real challenge for the EC to seek one of the 11 documents seems to be in Kishanganj, Purnia, Araria and Katihar districts of Seemanchal region, where people did not have proper documents in place and were seen standing in long queues at block offices, desperate to get residential certificates.More than two lakh such applications have been submitted in Kishanganj district alone in the first week of this month. “This is alarming and should be investigated,” BJP’s deputy CM Samrat Choudhary said.About a dozen BLOs in East Champaran district’s rural areas, when contacted, said since the Aadhaar card is not a valid document and birth certificate a must for enrolment as a voter, they suggest that voters provide either a caste certificate or land allotment certificate or any specific family register.At least two to five members of a family have migrated to urban areas for a long time and are not available in the villages.In Rupani village, in Patahi block of East Champaran, around 25 families are facing this problem as they have no papers. “We have voter cards only and have cast our votes on that basis in earlier polls. The BLOs suggested that we enrol where we live,” said a woman voter.Those who are employed somewhere else are also finding it difficult to fill in the form. Shyam Bihari Ojha, a railway employee posted at Bongaon, West Bengal, said he is a resident of Babhangaon near Ara, in Bhojpur district. “I can’t afford to take leave to visit my village for the documents of my parents, as is required among the 11 documents. My father is not even aware of the electoral roll revision. My parents have no birth certificate or any other document, except Aadhaar cards,” he said.Vivek Kumar of village Ratanpur, under Haspura block in Aurangabad district, said his family of 15 electors received only four forms. “We have been asked to attach documents like a copy of a matriculation certificate, Aadhaar card, and residential certificate with each form,” he said. Since all the documents are not available, they might face problems retaining their names on the voter list.Dhananjay Yadav of Baluan, Ara, said he is a zilla parishad member but had not yet got the enumeration form. Satyadev of Bhakura village has 10 eligible voters in his family but got only three forms. Many in Ara, including Kamlesh Kumar, have similar complaints.A BLO in Ara said many voters — particularly the elderly — without birth or any academic certificate are reluctant to furnish their land ownership documents.In Bhagalpur, Indradev Yadav said he and many others were camping at Babupur as their diara area was flooded. “From where will we procure documents?” he asked. Manohar Mandal, Jitendra Kumar, Anil Rai and Bhairo Paswan, also from the riverine area, said this was not the right time for such an exercise.There was a mixed response in Gaya district. While many said the process was easy, some voters complained they had not received forms. Anwar Hussain of Murarpur, in Gaya town, said all his 13 family members filled the forms and handed them to the BLO. Anju Kumari of New Godown area said the BLO collected the forms with a copy of a matriculation certificate attached.","The special intensive revision (sir) of electoral rolls in bihar has gained pace with 57% (4.5 crore) of the 7.89 crore enrolled voters submitting their enumeration forms by wednesday.

Court shuts Ajmer's Rs 243 crore bridge inaugurated days ago,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/court-shuts-ajmers-rs-243-crore-bridge-inaugurated-days-ago/articleshow/122350858.cms,"Ramsetu bridge suffered structural damage after the first rainfall since its construction

AJMER: In a damning indictment of public infrastructure management, the Ajmer Judicial Magistrate Court Number-2 on Wednesday ordered to immediately close the newly inaugurated Ramsetu bridge that suffered structural damage last week after the first rainfall since its construction.Rajasthan's Rs 243 crore project, meant to be a symbol of urban development, now stands as a monument to alleged administrative negligence and questionable construction practices.Judge Manmohan Chandel passed the order while treating a joint suit filed by two residents as a PIL. The court has directed both the Ajmer Municipal Corporation (AMC) and the Ajmer Smart City Ltd (ASCL) to submit their responses by July 11. The suit was filed on July 5, after which court issued notices to the district collector, AMC and ASCL. None of the respondents appeared on July 8 leading to a subsequent hearing on July 9.The closure order came on Wednesday despite the corporation's assertion that it had blocked one of the four roads on the elevated stretch. The court noted that since the same material was used in the bridge's construction, the entire structure posed a safety risk.The court's decision came after shocking revelations that the bridge, operational for merely days, showed significant structural deterioration following the season's first heavy rainfall on July 3. More alarmingly, court proceedings revealed the project proceeded without expert consultation, and relied instead on decisions made by a local citizens' forum. The pressing question that people are now grappling with is: How did a multi-crore infrastructure project fail so spectacularly, and who will be held responsible?","Ramsetu bridge suffered structural damage after the first rainfall since its construction.

NEW DELHI: Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran met West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on Wednesday, signalling a possible reset in ties between the industrial group and the state.The meeting, the first between Mamata Banerjee and a Tata Group chairman since Banerjee became chief minister, comes over 17 years after her agitation led to Tata Motors pulling out its Nano project from Singur.In a post on X, the TMC said, ""Mamata Banerjje hosted Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Sons and the Tata Group, for a constructive dialogue on Bengal's industrial growth and emerging opportunities. The meeting reflected Bengal's commitment to fostering meaningful public-private partnerships that drive innovation, investment, and inclusive development.""Seventeen years ago, following a protest led by Banerjee against land acquisition for a Tata Motors facility in Singur, the company relocated the plant. At the time, the state was governed by CPM under the late Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.The opposition Trinamool Congress in West Bengal, led by Mamata Banerjee, had led widespread protests after the state government had rejected her demand to return 400 acres land to farmers.In a move that was termed ""sad"" by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Tata announced his exit plan. PM Modi, who was then chief minister of Gujarat, spotted an opportunity and slid into the industrialist's DMs with a 'welcome' text.""When Ratan Tata said in a press conference in Kolkata that they are leaving West Bengal, I sent him a short SMS saying 'welcome'. And now you can see what a Re 1 (worth) SMS can do,"" Modi had said.Production of Nano cars was discontinued in 2018.At the Bengal Global Business Summit (BGBS), held in February this year, Banerjee had said in her speech that the Tata group chairman could not make it to the summit owing to certain exigencies.Banerjee had a detailed discussion with him on the eve of the summit. ""He has assured (me) that they want to invest more and more in Bengal. And he will come to Bengal very soon and discuss (things) in detail,"" she had said then.","Tata group chairman n chandrasekaran met west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee in kolkata on wednesday.

KOLKATA: Tata Group chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran came down to Nabanna on Wednesday to meet Mamata Banerjee - the first time a Tata Group chairman has done so in her 14-year tenure as West Bengal CM - to discuss future investment in the state.Chandrasekaran met Banerjee for about an hour at the latter's 14th-floor office, also marking the first face-to-face conversation between a Bengal CM and the Tata Group's senior-most executive since the group's forced exit from Bengal in 2008 amid the tumultuous Singur agitation (which was led by Banerjee, then the state's principal opposition leader).The Tata Group has a strong presence in Bengal through multiple entities - like TCS , Tata Hitachi, Tata Steel and Tata Global Beverages (formerly Tata Tea). There was no official communication from the administration on the subject of Wednesday's meeting but Nabanna seniors said it revolved around the availability of large land parcels in the state. Another topic that the discussion might have explored was the possibility of a direct Air India flight to Europe, they added.Chandrasekaran holds the post once held by Ratan Tata for close to two decades, and then by Cyrus Mistry. Banerjee has never met either Tata or Mistry after taking over as Bengal CM.The Tata Group (and Tata Sons ) chairman was accompanied by Confederation of Indian Industry director-general Chandrajit Banerjee. State chief secretary Manoj Pant, too, was present. Chandrasekaran left the city after the meeting, officials said.",Chandrasekaran met banerjee for about an hour at the latter's 14th-floor office.

It's a reality Vinitha and everyone else in Poonkayam village of Palakkad district still haven't reconciled to.""We can never imagine Nimisha killing someone,"" Vinitha said as the clock ticked on the fate of the ""honest, well-mannered girl"" who once walked the corridors of Dhathri Girls' High School in Kollengode with her.Poonkayam hasn't given up hope, though.

All these years, I knocked on every door possible to save Nimisha, but nothing has worked so far. My earnest plea to the Indian govt is to step in immediately,"" Tomy said.Michele lives in a school hostel in Kothamangalam. During Nimisha's weekly permitted phone calls or chats from prison, Tomy updates her on the initiatives to secure her release. He last spoke to his wife a week ago.Nimisha's mother is currently in Yemen for negotiations with tribal leaders and the victim's family to secure her release, hoping that the community's high regard for women would make them accept offers of ""blood money"".Nimisha was convicted of killing Talal Abdo Mahdi, with whom she had started a private clinic in Sana'a, in retaliation for allegedly torturing her and seizing her passport. A trial court pronounced the death sentence, that an appeals court upheld.Nimisha had travelled to Yemen along with Tomy in 2012, just a year after their marriage. After Michele was born, father and daughter returned home in 2014 due to the civil war in Yemen, while Nimisha stayed back to run their clinic in Sana'a.As the execution date draws near, the Save Nimisha Priya International Action Council has stepped up efforts to start negotiation talks with Talal's kin.

Political aggression manifesting in acts of violence like the Shiv Sena MLA Sanjay Gaikwad who slapped a canteen staff at the MLA hostel on Tuesday has also become a cause of concern. Some say the so-called ""language war"" needs to be curbed urgently.Puran Singh Rajput, whose family comes from Nathdwara in Rajasthan, runs a grocery shop in Mira Road. ""I was born here and know Marathi, but my father who has been in the city for over three decades cannot speak Marathi. I fear that tomorrow any activist can confront my father and humiliate him just because he does not speak Marathi,"" said Rajput.A taxi driver from UP, who did not want to be named, said his grasp of Marathi is ""30%"". ""I've been working in Mumbai for 25 years and picked it up on the job. I can answer basic questions, if someone wants to test me,"" he said, adding that this inadequacy has now led to a sense of insecurity.He said Indians should be free to work where they want within the country, and not be constrained by language. ""Maharashtrians live and work in different states and no one demands that they learn Bhojpuri in Bihar or Odia in Odisha. Then why do we, in Maharashtra, learn Marathi? This is nothing but politics, given BMC elections are around the corner,"" he said.Many say learning the language is an advantage, but forcing someone to speak in the tongue is akin to fuelling linguistic chauvinism, and using violence to ""punish"" those who cannot speak this language is simply lawlessness. They also blame the misuse of social media to amplify acts of violence perpetrated in the name of asserting linguistic supremacy. Shaikh Abdullah, whose Kurla-based bakery employs around 200 workers from different states, said in order to win over voters ahead of BMC polls, political workers are coining bigoted slogans and creating a climate of fear. ""We've people from different states working for us and it does not matter where they're from as long as he or she works efficiently. But there is a fear someone might hurt them if they fail the language test,"" he said.Captain Nalin Bilochan Pandey, originally from Bihar, runs a shipping company from Navi Mumbai. ""One of my Maharashtrian employees failed in Marathi in matriculation exam while my daughter who has a Bihari origin topped in Marathi at the same exam. So, putting people to language tests and using violence against those who cannot speak your language is unacceptable and is jeopardising social harmony,"" said Pandey.","Many fear that they or their employees could be targeted because they do not speak marathi fluently. Political aggression manifesting in acts of violence like the shiv sena mla sanjay gaikwad who slapped a canteen staff on tuesday has also become a cause of concern. Some say the so-called ""language war"" needs to be curbed urgently.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122351906,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-689417,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Centre set to approve 110-km Bhubaneswar bypass; road to connect Khurda and Cuttack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-set-to-approve-110-km-bhubaneswar-bypass-road-to-connect-khurda-and-cuttack/articleshow/122348382.cms,"Odisha is set to get a mega 110-km highway project, costing around Rs 8,300 crore.

New Delhi: Odisha is set to get a mega 110-km highway project, costing around Rs 8,300 crore. The six-lane Greenfield Capital Region Ring Road, or Bhubaneswar Bypass, will work as an arterial road for three major cities—Khurda, Bhubaneswar, and Cuttack. The new road will bring down travel time by 40 minutes, from the current two hours to 80 minutes.TOI has learnt that the proposal for the project has been cleared by an inter-ministerial panel, and it is likely to be approved by the Union cabinet in the next couple of weeks. The main purpose of the proposed access-controlled highway, which starts from Rameshwar in Khurda and terminates at Tangi (outside Cuttack), is to ease congestion in the existing 86-km section of the NH-16 passing through the three cities.The Kolkata-Chennai NH-16 passes through highly urbanised areas of these Odisha cities, and considering rapid urbanisation and growth in the state capital, Bhubaneswar, it is not practical to widen the NH. As per estimates, traffic in the state capital has crossed one lakh passenger car units (PCUs), leading to congestion. Officials said the proposed project is essential to address congestion and for the overall development of the region.The travel time on the existing NH is around two hours during peak hours, but it can stretch up to two and a half hours. The proposed greenfield road, designed for 100 kmph, is expected to reduce travel time to 1.2 hours. This will also help develop more urban areas outside these cities, sources said.As per the Centre’s policy for building bypasses, the Odisha govt will share 50% of the land cost. The total land cost has been estimated at Rs 1,029 crore. The project has been divided into three packages, and the entire corridor will have six interchanges, four elevated stretches, five major and 44 minor bridges, three rail overbridges, and 17 vehicle underpasses.Sources said the project will be built under the hybrid annuity model (HAM), and the successful bidder will have to complete the project in two and a half years and maintain it for the next 15 years.","Odisha is set to get a mega 110-km highway project, costing around rs 8,300 crore.

It’s time to govern, not just talk. Opposition days are over — now you have to deliver. Delhi is waiting for real work, not distractions or name-calling,"" said Delhi AAP president Saurabh Bharadwaj in a statement.Kejriwal’s comments, made during the release of the Punjabi edition of the book Kejriwal Model in Chandigarh on Tuesday, praised the performance of his government in Delhi despite hurdles.“Despite being stopped from working, we delivered. I should get a Nobel Prize for governance and administration for doing so much despite a lieutenant governor and various difficulties,” he said.Reacting sharply, Sachdeva accused Kejriwal of presiding over a regime tainted with scams.“Kejriwal demanding a Nobel Prize is laughable. The people of Delhi are stunned. If there were Nobel Prizes for incompetence, anarchy, and corruption, he would have surely received one,” Sachdeva said.He cited alleged scams during Kejriwal’s tenure — including the controversial renovation of his official residence, dubbed the “Sheesh Mahal” by BJP, and other issues such as the classroom construction project, liquor policy, and pension schemes.Kejriwal, who served as Delhi chief minister from 2015 until September 2024, had defended his governance model at the Chandigarh event, claiming that it was rooted in honesty.“If a government is corrupt, if its ministers are looting, this model will collapse,” he said, adding that the AAP model had also shown results in Punjab.“Previous governments claimed the treasury was empty. But we fixed schools and hospitals, gave free electricity — because we curbed corruption and saved public money,” he added.Taking aim at the current BJP administration in Delhi, Kejriwal alleged that services had “collapsed” since the AAP exited office.Sachdeva countered that Delhi’s residents had not forgotten the “scams” that took place under AAP’s watch — citing issues like panic buttons in buses and mismanagement of welfare schemes for women.","Delhi bjp chief virendra sachdeva ridicules arvind kejriwal's recent comment that he deserves a nobel prize for governance.

The loco pilot was immediately alerted to ensure that both the jumbo and the calf were safe.Divisional forest officer, Ramgarh, Nitish Kumar, said: ""A forest guard informed me that a pregnant elephant is lying on the tracks in labour pain.

HYDERABAD: Telangana police on Wednesday arrested five people, including three of the most senior office-bearers of the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA), in a case of forgery and misappropriation of funds. Among those arrested are president A Jagan Mohan Rao, treasurer C J Srinivas Rao and CEO Suneel Kante. Two top executives of a city-based cricket club too have been arrested. The role of another senior HCA office bearer is being probed.Sources said the investigators also took into account the findings of a vigilance and enforcement inquiry report on allegations against the HCA chief and others of harassing the SRH management for free tickets during IPL.Based on a complaint by Dharam Gurava Reddy, general secretary of Telangana Cricket Association (TCA), filed on June 9, CID filed a case under Sections 465 (punishment for forgery), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record), 403 (dishonest misappropriation of property), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent), 420 (cheating) read with 34 (common intention).TCA is not recognised by BCCI . The complainant alleged president A Jagan Mohan Rao contested the HCA elections using a forged document. It was also alleged Rao, along with some HCA apex council members, misappropriated over Rs 2.3 crore from the association.CID officials told TOI they discovered Rao had used a forged cricket club membership to qualify for the 2023 HCA elections. ""Rao furnished a forged membership of Gowlipura Cricket Club to contest in the elections and won,"" said a CID official.CID arrested Gowlipura Cricket Club president G Kavita and her husband Rajender Yadav, who is the general secretary of the club, for aiding Rao in committing the offence. CID officials also alleged that Rao, along with treasurer C J Srinivas Rao and CEO Suneel Kante, who are apex council members of HCA, misappropriated HCA funds under the guise of performing their official duties.CID picked up Rao from his residence in Gachibowli, Srinivas from Padma Rao Nagarand Kante from Begumpet. Rajender Yadav and Kavita were taken into custody later in the night.HCA had copped a lot of flak this IPL season over excessive demands for complimentary passes. SRH had alleged illtreatment by HCA and threatened to shift their operations out of the city. The team management alleged that as against the agreement of giving 3,900 complimentary passes to the association for every match — 10% of the stadium’s capacity — the HCA president was asking for 20 more passes. The issue even threatened to derail a match between SRH and LSG.","Telangana police on wednesday arrested five people, including three of the most senior office-bearers of the hyderabad cricket association.

Panna's grand 'Dadi' who endured everything but time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pannas-grand-dadi-who-endured-everything-but-time/articleshow/122352651.cms,"Vatsala, who forest officials said was over a 100 years old, died in Panna Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday

BHOPAL: She never mated, yet raised generations of calves. She survived brutal attacks, lived through blindness, and stood as a matriarch in the forests of Panna Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh for over three decades. But when Vatsala died this week, the gentle elephant did so just short of global recognition - because of one missing document.On Tuesday, Vatsala collapsed into a pit near Hinauta Elephant Camp and could not rise. Her body finally gave way. Forest officials said she was more than 100 years old - a contender for Guinness Book of World Records - but could not secure the title. ""Without official records from her early life or veterinary documentation from the time of her capture, we couldn't meet the strict criteria set by Guinness. We were so close,"" said a senior officer.Vatsala was brought from Kerala to MP's Narmadapuram in 1971, already around 50. She understood only Malayalam then, silent before the Hindi- and Gondi-speaking mahouts of MP. But she eventually bonded with Maniram Gond, the mahout assigned to her in 1994, when both were transferred to Panna.""When I first called her, she didn't even blink,"" said Maniram. ""We were strangers - two beings from different worlds.""But over 30 years together, they formed a bond beyond language. ""She began to understand my tone, my touch. Even without words, we figured each other out.""Known across the reserve for her calm temperament, Vatsala allowed schoolchildren to play beneath her belly. ""She was like a grandmother,"" said Maniram. Though she never bore calves, she mothered many. Called 'Dadi' by staff, she nurtured young elephants, guiding and protecting them while keeping a deliberate distance from males.That refusal triggered one of the darkest moments in her life. In 2003 and again in 2008, a male named Rambhahdur attacked her when she resisted his mating attempts. ""He tore her stomach open. Her intestines were out. It took nine months to treat her,"" Maniram said. Vatsala never retaliated.By 2004, her eyesight had deteriorated completely. She was retired from patrol duty and placed under Maniram's full-time care. ""Even fully blind, she'd raise her trunk when I called her name,"" he said.Officials had sent tusk samples to labs to verify her age through scientific analysis. ""There's no forensic system available to determine exact age,"" said APCCF (Wildlife) L Krishnamurthy, ""but she would be remembered forever.""","Vatsala, who forest officials said was over a 100 years old, died in panna tiger reserve in madhya pradesh on tuesday.
