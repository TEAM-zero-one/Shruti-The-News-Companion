What's the case about?

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate on Friday summoned industrialist Anil Ambani on August 5 in loan fraud case amid probe over bribery, unsecured loans allegations.Ambani, 66, has been asked to depose at the ED headquarters in Delhi as the case has been registered here, sources told news agency PTI.The agency will record his statement under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) once he deposes, they said.Meanwhile, the agency is conducting search in Bhubaneshwar and Kolkata in connections with fake bank guarantee racket.""The agency recorded an ECIR (Enforcement Case Information Report) based on a case registered by the Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police dated November 11, 2024 in the matter,"" officials said.This comes days after the central probing agency conducted simultaneous raids in connection of financial irregularities and collective loan ""diversion"" of more than Rs 10,000 crore by multiple group companies of Ambani.ED sources had said the investigation primarily pertains to allegations of illegal loan diversion of around Rs 3,000 crore, given by the Yes Bank to the group companies of Ambani between 2017-2019.Officials said that searches were done at over 35 locations in Mumbai, covering 50 companies and 25 individuals under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).A Delhi-based ED unit is spearheading the investigation.The agency is probing alleged improper diversion of approximately Rs 3,000 crore in loans, granted by Yes Bank to Ambani's group companies between 2017 and 2019. In reaction to the raids, Reliance Power and Reliance Infrastructure issued clarification letters to the exchanges.According to officials, multiple agencies, including the National Housing Bank, SEBI, National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA), and Bank of Baroda, have shared relevant information with the ED.Officials told that “ED has found gross violations in Yes Bank loan approvals to RAAGA companies,” including backdated Credit Approval Memorandums, lack of due diligence, and breaches of the bank’s credit policies. The loans were allegedly diverted to multiple group and shell companies.Red flags identified include loans to entities with weak financials, shared addresses and directors, poor documentation, and evergreening of loans. Officials also noted, “SEBI is also learnt to have shared its findings with ED in the case of RHFL.”The searches at premises identified with industrialist Anil Ambani have huge financial implications for public money, Rs 20-30,000 crore, which the agency believes has been siphoned off, including outside the country, through ""undisclosed foreign bank accounts and foreign assets"" created over the years.A large chunk of the money came to Reliance ADAG from SBI and other public sector banks, besides Yes Bank, then a private entity, and mutual funds.Preliminary investigation has thrown up a mysterious entity: 'C Company'. The entity, whose existence was not known so far, is allegedly found to have been involved in related party transactions in this whole scam, sources said.","Ambani, 66, has been asked to depose at the ed headquarters in delhi as the case has been registered here.

Mumbai/Pune: It has been painful to endure accusations for 17 years, Lt Col Prasad Purohit told TOI after being acquitted in the Malegaon blast case on Thursday. Purohit, currently stationed at an Army unit in Mumbai, said, ""I did not do anything against my country. There is nothing above the nation. How can a serving army officer, who sacrificed so much while serving for the nation, be involved in acts of terrorism?""He spent almost nine years in jail. ""I lost the cream period of my active service, facing difficulties on multiple fronts - personal, professional, family, friendships, and societal. What was more painful was that my wife, children (2 sons) and my family members endured these painful years.""At the time of arrest, Purohit was with the Army's corps of military intelligence. ""I fought for justice to prove I was never involved in this. The journey was long and unbearable. But I had faith in the judiciary, and today's verdict is testament to my belief,"" he said.Pragya Thakur, dressed in saffron robes, sat in the witness box and broke down after the verdict was pronounced. ""I was detained illegally for 13 days and tortured. I was living my life as a sanyasi and was labelled a terrorist. My life was destroyed by the allegations,"" she said, addressing the court. She added, ""Ye bhagwa ki vijay hui hai, Hindutva ki vijay hui hai (Saffron has won, Hindutva has won).""She said she was happy at least the judge heard their side. ""My life has become meaningful now. Whoever did wrong with us, God will never forgive them,"" she said.Referring to police in the courtroom, she said, ""The way those people did illegal work within the law, our life has been ruined. I can't live a moment in peace. I want to keep myself alive; maybe I am alive because I am a sanyasi. You have defamed the bhagwa.""Sudhakar Chaturvedi, another of the acquitted accused, said, ""I was framed and tortured by police. A bomb was planted at my house. My nails were plucked. It was not a Hindu-Muslim thing. A verdict has been delivered, not justice… It wouldn't be considered justice until those who framed us are charged.""He added their legal battle was still on. ""NIA has mentioned ATS planted a bomb at my house, and I was targeted due to my bhagwa attire,"" he said, adding that when he was taken into ATS custody, he was forced to take the names of Yogi Adityanand and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat.Major Ramesh Upadhyay (Retd) told TOI, ""My family and I went through pain and agony for 17 years but today is a day of celebration. Life will be much happier for me after today… On this day, I remember Balasaheb Thackeray, who stood by us.""Another acquitted accused, Sameer Kulkarni, said when he was arrested, he felt like ""a dirty blame"" had been put on him. He argued his case himself; he said if other accused had not hired a lawyer, the trial would have ended 15 years ago. He accused the defence and prosecution of prolonging it. The verdict, he said, ""is a rebirth for us.""Talking to media outside the court, Purohit said, ""I am extremely grateful to the court and all those who stood by me for understanding the case and delivering justice... Malice is over, and it should not be there. We are a great country, a developing nation. I expect and wish everyone should contribute positively towards the country. Let's be forward-looking.""(Reported by Mateen Hafeez, Shourya Avankhedkar, Pushkraj Vernekar, Prasad Kulkarni & Sandip Dighe)","Lt col prasad purohit said, ""i did not do anything against my country"" pragya thakur, dressed in saffron robes, sat in the witness box and broke down after the verdict was pronounced.

"Opposition resolves to keep collective focus on SIR in House, dubs it 'vote chori'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-resolves-to-keep-collective-focus-on-sir-in-house-dubs-it-vote-chori/articleshow/123031040.cms,"NEW DELHI: Deciding to call it ""vote chori"" for better political messaging, the opposition Thursday resolved to keep its collective focus on Special Intensive Review of electoral rolls during the remainder part of the monsoon session. After the discussion on the Pahalgam terror attack, it is set to demand one on SIR, a move that puts the functioning of Parliament in the coming weeks under a cloud given the government's reluctance on the sensitive issue targeted at BJP and Election Commission.At a discussion of the INDIA bloc leaders Thursday, the opposition agreed to keep their single-minded focus on the EC's electoral rolls review which has roiled election-bound Bihar, and would be implemented in the rest of the country. Rahul Gandhi is learnt to have led the discussion by alleging that the issues in Parliament are important, but the BJP is winning the elections by ""manipulating"" the voters' lists.The opposition's thinking was evident from the fact that the meeting also discussed the tariffs imposed by Donald Trump, with some dubbing them as a rebuff to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP. Congress Lok Sabha whip Manickam Tagore even moved an adjournment motion on the government's ""economic and diplomatic failure"" over tariffs.But the protest in the House which paralysed its functioning was solely on SIR.It was also mentioned in passing that Rahul make a presentation to the anti-BJP camp on how the ""tampering"" is being done, based on what Congress claims to have unearthed in the Bangalore Rural Lok Sabha seat.The meeting, which comprised Gaurav Gogoi, Supriya Sule, T R Baalu, Ramgopal Yadav, N K Premachandran, Derek O'Brien, John Brittas, KC Venugopal, felt other issues though important should be kept aside as distraction.Interestingly, the opposition decided to adopt the Trinamool Congress's appellation of SIR, calling it ""vote chori"". It was felt SIR is too esoteric for the common man to grasp its political significance.Rahul is learnt to have argued that issues in Parliament are effective, but BJP is winning elections on the ground through a different strategy focused on electoral rolls. An MP quoted Rahul as saying that after defeats in states that appeared tilted towards Congress, the party believed it was because of weak organisation. But after studying Bangalore Rural, it is convinced there are other reasons. ""We have found a pattern,"" he reportedly said.Sources said the opposition is unanimous on the issue, and the ball is in the government's court on accepting the demand for a discussion on Special Intensive Review.","The opposition agreed to keep their single-minded focus on the ec's electoral rolls review which has roiled election-bound bihar.

SC slams WB's 10-yr exclusionary norm of continuous teaching,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-slams-wbs-10-yr-exclusionary-norm-of-continuous-teaching/articleshow/123030941.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has slammed the West Bengal govt's decision to deny teachers who had joined universities in West Bengal from other states the benefit of extension of retirement age from 60 to 65 years on the parochial ground that they had not taught in state-domiciled institutions for a continuous period of 10 years.A bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Manoj Mishra said it can never be the intention of a state to deprive teachers of the benefit of retirement age extension despite their having requisite experience from universities outside its jurisdiction.""Classifying employees based on past teaching experience from universities within or outside West Bengal, particularly at the verge of retirement, after having served for decades lacks nexus and discernible object,"" the bench said.Writing the judgement, Justice Narasimha said, ""When such decisions are subjected to strict scrutiny in judicial review, they unfortunately expose themselves as parochial, potentially undermining our resolve of fraternity"".He added, ""Constitutional courts must be vigilant and identify such decisions, embedded in the nooks and crannies of public administration and set them aside, for they have the potentiality of triggering similar actions by other States and their Instrumentalities"".The bench said it is easy to adjudicate a dispute on the constitutional scale of equality, which can be asserted by a citizen as a fundamental right.However, the principle of fraternity, one of the founding goals of the Constitution, rarely asserts itself.""It is the duty of the constitutional court to recognise its erosion, even in the bylanes of public administration and to restore the essential 'We' to ensure the unity and integrity of the nation,"" said Justice Narasimha.",West bengal govt denied teachers benefit of extension of retirement age from 60 to 65 years on parochial ground.

NEW DELHI: On the eve of publication of the draft electoral roll in Bihar, based on enumeration phase of the special intensive revision (SIR) exercise, chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar said physical and digital copies of the draft roll will be given to all recognised political parties by the 38 district election officers (DEOs), to check for any wrong inclusions or exclusions and seek their correction.The draft roll will also be available online, on the EC portal and ECINet app, for public viewing. ""The chief electoral officer of Bihar and 243 electoral registration officers (EROs) will be inviting any elector of that assembly constituency or any recognised political party in Bihar to come forward and make claims and objections from Aug 1 to Sept 1, 2025, for adding names of missing eligible electors, removing names of ineligible electors or correction of any entry in the draft electoral roll,"" he told TOI.Sources said the roll will not only reflect exclusions based on reports of booth level officers relating to the deceased, permanently shifted and untraceable electors and those found enrolled at multiple places (totalling 65 lakh in all), but also new voters enrolling for the first time or those who have shifted to Bihar from outside the state. ""Anybody who has applied through Form 6 (first-time voter) or Form 8 (shifting from outside Bihar), in the required format, and with the necessary documents, including proof of their citizenship and, where applicable, their parents' citizenship, during the enrolment phase, and his application is processed, will be on the draft roll,"" an EC official said.The official added that applications for additions to the roll will be accepted till the last day of nomination for the upcoming Bihar polls.

"Malegaon blast case: Bomb could have been placed later on motorbike, says judge",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/malegaon-blast-case-bomb-could-have-been-placed-later-on-motorbike-says-judge/articleshow/123030437.cms,"MUMBAI: Thursday's judgment in the 2008 Malegaon blast case , in which all seven accused were acquitted, also focused on the failure to establish that a bomb was fitted inside a motorcycle. Based on the evidence, the judge said a bomb could have been placed later on the bike. Refuting the prosecution's case, the judge also noted that it could not be proved that the bike on which the bomb was allegedly fitted belonged to Thakur, that RDX was procured by Lt Col Prasad Purohit from Kashmir, or that he assembled the bomb.The judge also found sanction orders granted under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act to be defective and invalid, issued without ""application of judicial mind"".The NIA judge said the conspiracy in Malegaon blast case remained unproven due to absence of evidence and witnesses who would testify that a series of meetings were held by the organisation named Abhinav Bharat to plan the attack.ATS probes focused on the alleged conspiracy by a group intent on avenging perceived atrocities against Hindus. The crux of prosecution's case was that the plot revealed an effort to strike terror by orchestrating a bomb blast in Malegaon, a Muslim-dominated area.However, the judge said to show that the main elements of the conspiracy were finalised at Faridabad and Bhopal, the prosecution was not supported by ""material witnesses"" and the testimony of those who did was not ""reliable and acceptable...other meetings which were held at Kolkata, Indore, Ujjain, Nashik and Pune, no acceptable evidence is present on these on record... witnesses have retracted from their earlier statements given to ATS. Therefore, neither conspiracy is proved nor meetings are proved,"" the judge said. While it was alleged that that accused Ajay Rahirkar, acting as treasurer of Abhinav Bharat, collected donations and distributed funds to Lt Col Prasad Purohit, who was a trustee, as well as to Sudhakar Dhar Diwedi and Major Ramesh Upadhyay (Retd), Purohit used these funds for personal expenses, including house construction and paying for LIC policies. ""But there was no evidence that the said amount was used for terrorist activities,"" the judge said.The retraction by 39 of 323 prosecution witnesses of statements given to ATS considerably weakened the case. ""Testimony of prosecution witnesses is riddled with material inconsistencies and contradictions,"" the judge said.Referring to procedural shortcomings, the judge was critical of the handling of the crime scene. It was revealed that no rough sketch map was drawn, and the spot was not immediately barricaded, leading to contamination. The judge pointed out that a mob gathered at the spot after the blast, pelted stones, vandalised cars, caused damage to a police chowki, and snatched the firearms of police officers. He said a counterattack by police involved lathicharge, firing, and use of grenades.Despite the presence of a fingerprint expert, no prints, DNA samples, or other critical data were collected at the spot. The judge said since the spot was contaminated, analysis of articles found could not be considered 100% accurate anyway. Even material seized such as mobiles and laptops were not sealed as per due process.The judgment also raised concerns about procedures adopted for collecting voice samples and intercepting mobile communication. The judge observed that interceptions were not authorised in the specific period, and permissions were obtained belatedly. This rendered the intercepted data unusable as evidence. It was also noted that ""narco analysis was carried out of the accused by ATS but not supported by documents and it was not filed on record"".The judgment even raised concerns about planting of evidence and tampering of material. It has called for an inquiry into the actions of ATS officer Shekhar Bagade, whose presence at an accused's house was seen to be under suspicious circumstances. ""House search of accused Sudhakar Chaturvedi tilt towards planting (of RDX) in the light of evidence of record. There was no conscious possession over the house, and articles, found at the relevant time,"" the judge said. Chaturvedi was accused of assembling the bomb at his home, a claim he denied.The judge pointed out that despite allegations that Purohit had brought RDX from Kashmir, no evidence was presented to show its storage at his house or its use in assembling the bomb. Interestingly, NIA's supplementary chargesheet in May 2016 had accused ATS of planting RDX traces to frame Purohit and, notably, gave a clean chit to Pragya Thakur and others, citing insufficient evidence. Despite NIA's stance, the special court, on Dec 27, 2017, ruled that seven accused, including Thakur and Purohit, would face trial under UAPA, though charges under MCOCA were dropped.In his concluding remarks Thursday, the judge expressed awareness of ""agony, frustration and trauma caused to society at large, more particularly to the family of victims, by the fact that a crime of this nature has gone unpunished"".""However law does not permit the court to convict the accused solely on the basis of moral conviction or suspicion,"" the judge said.As per the judgment, a compensation of Rs 2 lakh is to be paid to families of those who died in the blast, while the 95 injured will receive Rs 50,000 each. The case, meanwhile, will continue against two absconding accused, Ramji Kalsangra & Sandeep Dange. Five different judges have so far presided over proceedings. The tenure of the current judge, A K Lahoti, was recently extended by Bombay high court till Aug 31, 2025 to ensure he could deliver the verdict.","Nia judge says the conspiracy in malegaon blast case remained unproven due to absence of evidence.
