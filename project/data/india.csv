Karnataka HC’s Dharwad bench slammed state government for using bureaucratic red tape to deny medical reimbursement, ruling that an associate professor’s claim of nearly Rs 14 lakh could not be rejected simply because a hospital changed its name.Justice Suraj Govindaraj called the denial “arbitrary and legally unsustainable” after authorities refused to reimburse Shivanandappa Doddagoudar, associate professor at a government first-grade college in Haveri’s Ranebennur. His treatment at Kasturba Medical College Hospital, Manipal, was rejected on grounds that the institution later updated its name to Kasturba Hospital, Manipal.Doddagoudar said the hospital was on govt’s approved list under Karnataka Government Servants (Medical Attendance) Rules, 1963. The hospital formally sought a name correction in March 2021. Despite the request, officials failed to update the recognised list and rejected reimbursement claims.The state higher education department and Suvarna Arogya Suraksha Trust had contended that only hospitals listed under their exact names could qualify and any deviation was unacceptable.Justice Govindaraj disagreed, saying the hospital had already been vetted and approved: “Mere change of nomenclature did not alter the hospital’s identity or services.” The court has directed higher education department to reconsider the reimbursement claim within six weeks.",Karnataka hc’s dharwad bench slammed state government for using bureaucratic red tape to deny medical reimbursement.

Build bridges of harmony between hills and valley: Prime Minister Modi in Manipur,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/build-bridges-of-harmony-between-hills-and-valley-prime-minister-modi-in-manipur/articleshow/123873836.cms,"PM Modi in Manipur

IMPHAL:





Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday made a personal outreach to the people of Manipur , a state torn apart by ethnic strife, urging them to “build bridges of harmony between the hills and the valley”, and backed it with the unveiling of projects worth Rs 8,500 crore, aimed at rebuilding infrastructure and restoring hope.Modi’s message was clear, a reconciliation must replace resentment, and development must bridge the divide.“Govt of Bharat is making every possible effort to restore normalcy in Manipur. Today, I assure you, I am with you, the Govt of Bharat is with the people of Manipur,” Modi said.This visit comes at a time when the MHA has taken decisive steps to lay the groundwork for peace. On September 4, the Centre and the Manipur government extended the Suspension of Operations (SoO) agreement with two umbrella groups of armed Kuki National Organisation (KNO) and the United People’s Front (UPF). This revised pact is a structured overture toward reconciliation, reaffirming Manipur’s territorial integrity while creating space for dialogue, dignity, and healing.Defying heavy rain in Manipur which grounded his helicopter, Modi in a deeply symbolic gesture, travelled 60 km from Imphal in the valley by road to Churachandpur in the hills, where he personally met families displaced by the conflict, listened to their concerns and reaffirmed the Centre’s commitment to restoring peace and dignity.Later while addressing the gathering at the Peace Ground in Churachandpur, Modi said, “The land and region of Manipur is a land of hope and promise. Unfortunately, violence had gripped this magnificent area. A little while ago, I met the affected people who are living in camps. After speaking with them, I can say that a new dawn of hope and confidence is awaiting Manipur.”The ethnic violence between the Meitei and Kuki-zo erupted in May 2023, killing some 260 people and displacing about 60,000 people across 280 relief camps.He said that the government is aiding construction of 7,000 new homes for families that have been displaced and recently, a special package of nearly Rs 3000 crore has been approved, and an additional special provision of 500 crore rupees has been made for helping the displaced persons.Modi’s visit was a powerful gesture of reconciliation, as he reached out to the emotional epicentres of the state’s two deeply divided communities, Meitei and Kuki-Zo—Imphal and Churachandpur respectively, where he unveiled development projects for the entire state, suggesting that the New Delhi sees reconciliation as both possible and necessary.These projects will establish new health and education facilities, enhance the ease of living, strengthen infrastructure, create new employment opportunities, strengthen road infrastructure and empower women, experts said.At Churachandpur, Modi began his Manipur trip by reaffirming a fundamental principle, “Establishing peace is essential for development anywhere,” that set the tone for his message, emphasizing that economic progress and infrastructure growth are impossible without social harmony and a direct appeal to both communities and stakeholders to prioritize stability.Expressing pleasure that recent dialogues have begun with different groups in the hills and valleys for reaching agreements, he said these efforts are part of the centre’s commitment to establishing peace through dialogue, respect, and mutual understanding as he urged all organizations to move forward on the path of peace, fulfil their dreams, and secure the future of their children.In Imphal, the Prime Minister laid out a broader national vision, linking Manipur’s growth to India’s future.“In the 21st century, India is moving forward with a singular goal—the goal of a developed India and achieving this goal requires the development of Manipur,” he said.Underlining that Imphal is a city of possibilities, Modi remarked that he envisions Imphal as one of the developed cities of India that will fulfil the dreams of the youth and accelerate the nation’s progress. Under this vision, several projects have been completed in Imphal under the Smart City Mission, he said, adding that many other projects worth hundreds of crores are also progressing rapidly.“Manipur possesses a rich heritage that spans thousands of years. The cultural roots of the region are deep and strong. Manipur is the crown jewel adorning the crest of Mother India,” said PM Modi , emphasizing the need to continuously strengthen Manipur’s developmental image.He said that any form of violence in Manipur is unfortunate and such violence is a grave injustice to both our ancestors and future generations. He stressed the importance of consistently advancing Manipur on the path of peace and development.The Prime Minister highlighted Manipur’s inspiring contribution to India’s freedom struggle and national defence and recalled that it was on Manipur’s soil where the Indian National Army first hoisted India’s own flag. He quoted Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, who referred to Manipur as the gateway to India’s independence and paid tribute to the many brave martyrs from this land.He said that centre and state are moving forward with the goal of making Manipur a symbol of peace, prosperity, and progress and assured that both govts “will continue to cooperate in Manipur’s development, in resettling the displaced people at appropriate locations as soon as possible, and in establishing peace.”“The 21st century belongs to the East and the NorthEast,” Modi declared, underscoring the Centre’s unwavering focus on Manipur’s development.He noted that before 2014, the state’s growth rate was less than one percent, but today, Manipur is progressing many times faster. Modi announced that a new phase of infrastructure development has begun, with the pace of road construction and National Highway expansion increasing manifold. He added that rapid work is underway to extend road connectivity to every village, positioning Manipur as a rising engine of India’s growth story.",Prime minister narendra modi on saturday made a personal outreach to the people of manipur.

Another letter was from Christie, then staying at the Ashoka Hotel in New Delhi, to Rosalind, her daughter.

From Delhi, she wrote again to Rosalind.

Some mysteries need to be actively cracked, but some solve themselves with time.There has been constant speculation about Agatha Christie’s India connection. One question has recurred over the years, but has never really been accurately answered: did Agatha Christie ever visit India? The internet and popular belief will state that she did not. I, too, had often puzzled over how Christie, a world traveller, had never actually been to India. In fact, in a video in 2021, I had even concluded that she indeed hadn’t.Until one cool but sunny Easter day in Wales.In March 2024, I met Christie’s grandson, Mathew Prichard, and his lovely wife Lucy, at their charming home in Wales. Prichard, now in his 80s, had been very close to his grandmother.It was a memorable day, but it turned momentous when Mathew showed me Christie’s personal memorabilia — her passports, her first typed and edited manuscripts, rare photos, her camera, and her last portrait painting, which hung on one of the walls of his house.When Mathew signed and gifted me a copy of his grandmother’s latest biography, I also realised what a mammoth task he had been entrusted with — to preserve her legacy, and how he had upheld that trust: a proud grandson of the Queen of Crime.It was when I mentioned how strange it was that Christie had never visited India, that he glanced at me with a twinkle in his blue eyes, and said, “Oh, but she did!” I was startled. This was contrary to all that we believed. A few minutes later, as I skimmed through the numerous black-and-white, well-preserved photos, I found some that made my heart race — pictures of Christie with a garland, descending from an Indian Airlines plane. Here, finally, was the missing link to a long-standing puzzle.I was on the threshold of solving a real mystery, but I needed to know more. At my request, the archivist Joseph Keogh dug deeper and came up with some fascinating, unpublicised facts. Christie had indeed visited India — not once, but twice. From her passport stamps, he traced her travel itinerary for the two trips.Her first trip was in Jan 1960, when she visited Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka), then India and Pakistan. From Jan 11 to Feb 2, she travelled to Bombay (now Mumbai), headed to South India’s Madras (now Chennai), did some sightseeing at the Ajanta Caves, and then on to Delhi. Between Feb 2 and 9, she went to Nepal and returned to Patna and Delhi, finally leaving for Karachi on Feb 17.Some letters were also found that referenced her trips. It appeared that the 1960 trip was for a lecture tour by her second husband, the archaeologist Max Mallowan.Future plans are, roughly, leave for Madras today — go via southern India to Bombay arriving 17th or 18th — Then some sightseeing near Bombay Agenta Caves (sic) etc and on to Delhi and then to Nepal on Jan 31st for a week — c/o British Embassy would find us there as I’m not sure what the hotel is.Our plans are a bit different at the moment as accommodation at hotels is very hard to get exactly when one wants it but we shall be in and out of the Ashoka Hotel at Delhi between Jan 28th and Feb 2nd — and then Nepal (c/o British Embassy Kathmandu) 2nd to 9th then in and out of Ashoka again finally leaving it on Feb 17th for Karachi. So forward anything you think I ought to see to the Ashoka at Delhi — but nothing that I needn’t!!On our arrival here yesterday evening, several archaeologists were waiting with two porters and loads of archaeological material from their… dig. The examination of same intrigued the Ashoka guests very much.Christie’s second trip to India, a year later, seemed to be for leisure. The passport has a Palam, New Delhi stamp (month not specified) in 1961. This time she visited Srinagar in Kashmir and stayed at the Oberoi Palace. This is what she wrote to her daughter Rosalind:Lake and mountains rather lovely. This is a Hotel rather like at Jaipur — converted Rajah’s Palace — miles and miles of corridors — enormous rooms and we are in a kind of supersuite looking over lake. It’s all terribly dried up by this time of year — one ought really to come in May-June. Now one must be content by rich beds of red salvia and dahlias in the Hotel garden. Temp is about 50 at night. Delicious hot sun to sit in and about 60 in day. Suits me very well. We made some excursions — to the various Mogul gardens — and to a lake… which is very beautiful and ringed with snowclad mountains. You can see the mountains now after the rain. We have to leave here and go to the Hotel in the town — but expect that our booking for Nov 2nd to Delhi will be all right.Here we are in the Ashoka. I’m glad we had a good ten days and in a perfect Hotel for old ladies (very few of them nowadays) where I could sit, in the sun — and look at a view like a Japanese print. Lovely! The letters revealed Christie’s bright, chirpy personality and tongue-in-cheek humour, her eagerness to explore India and her appreciation of scenic beauty. She seemed happy to be in India.But I pondered why her trips were not well-known. Was it because photographs were a rarity then or because she checked into the hotels in her husband’s name — or perhaps simply because Agatha Christie was a private person?Whatever the reason, I was thrilled with my discovery. That sunny day with Mathew, Lucy and Gwynnie the dog carried an extra fulfilling zing because of this exciting revelation.I had always sensed a deep connection to Agatha Christie. But being the chosen one to unravel the mystery of her India trips felt truly special.The author is an award-winning writer of mystery novels[Extracts and photographs used with permission from Mathew Prichard and The Christie Archive Trust.

Noida hostel firing incident: Gunshot kills 22-year-old student,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/noida-hostel-firing-incident-gunshot-leaves-22-year-old-student-dead/articleshow/123794605.cms,"NOIDA: A 22-year-old student was found dead with a gunshot wound in the head while his close friend lay critically injured with a similar wound inside a private hostel room in Knowledge Park in Noida on Tuesday morning. Police are trying to piece together how the gunshots were fired and what led to the shooting as the two students were considered ""inseparable"" by friends.The incident occurred around 10.30am at RCI Vidya Vihar hostel in Knowledge Park-III. The two students - Deepak Kumar (22) from Andhra Pradesh and Devansh Chauhan (23) from Agra - were both enrolled in the PGDM programme at Birla Institute of Management Technology (Bimtech). They were, however, not roommates. It was in Kumar's room where the shots were fired. Chauhan is in Kailash hospital. His condition is critical.Both bullets came from the same licensed revolver, which was fully loaded and belonged to Chauhan's father Surender Singh Chauhan, who retired as a circle officer in UP STF on Aug 31. Chauhan, who went home last Saturday to attend his father's farewell party, is believed to have sneaked the gun out when he left for his hostel on Tuesday morning itself.Chauhan had reached the hostel barely a couple of hours before the incident.""He had come home on Saturday to attend our father's retirement party. On Tuesday morning, he returned to college. He left home around 5.30am and reached his hostel by 9am. It was around noon that we received a call from the college authorities about the firing incident,"" said Shivang Chaurasia, Chauhan's brother who lives in Gurgaon.Surender Chauhan told TOI he kept the gun in a cupboard in his room. ""It was only a few hours since Chauhan left home. I didn't realise that the gun was missing too.""At Vidya Vihar hostel, it was a guard who first sensed something amiss after hearing faint groans from the locked room. Unable to get any response, he alerted the hostel warden. After repeated attempts to open the door failed, some staff members climbed to the rear balcony with a ladder and peered inside.

Earlier, the Ahmednagar district was renamed as Ahilyanagar district, PTI reported.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar , who had pursued the matter, thanked Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw for granting the approval.Chief inmister Devendra Fadnavis and deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde were also involved in the efforts, a statement from Pawar’s office said.Last month, Pawar had written to Vaishnaw urging that the station be renamed to align with the city’s new name.“This long-pending demand has now been fulfilled. The renaming holds special significance as we are celebrating the 300th birth anniversary year of Punyashlok Ahilyadevi Holkar,” Pawar said.Several organisations and citizens had been demanding that the railway station’s name be changed after the city was renamed Ahilyanagar.Pawar also said efforts are underway to rename Aurangabad railway station as Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar railway station.Earlier, a similar thing was done by Karnataka government but that didn't go well with Fadnavis. The Congress government in Karnataka moved to rename Shivajinagar metro rail station in Bengaluru after St Mary.Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah recently said his government would consider renaming Bengaluru's Shivajinagar metro station after St Mary following a request made during the annual feast at St Mary's Basilica. His deputy DK Shivakumar had claimed there is nothing unusual in responding to such community requests.Talking to reporters here, Fadnavis said, ""I condemn the Karnataka government's move to rename Shivajinagar metro station in Bengaluru after St Mary. Its an insult to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The Congress has continued its tradition of insulting the Maratha warrior king since the time of Nehru who made comments against Shivaji Maharaj in his book Discovery of India."" Fadnavis said he was praying that the Almighty gives Siddaramaiah sense to not go ahead with such a decision that is based on religion and was against the Maratha warrior king.","The government is changing the station name to ahilyanagar railway station.
