'False, Baseless': Congress Women MPs Write To LS Speaker Om Birla, Reject Threat To PM Modi Charge

NEW DELHI: Women MPs from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla , urging him to take strict action against opposition MPs for allegedly committing “heinous acts” inside the House during last week’s proceedings.In their letter, the MPs praised the Speaker for maintaining order and decorum during the discussion on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address on February 4, but accused opposition of creating chaos.""We wish to express our profound gratitude and admiration for the exemplary manner in which you upheld and protected the dignity, decorum, and sanctity of the Lok Sabha during the discussion on the Motion of Thanks on the Honourable President's Address on February 4, 2026. On that day, the entire House, and indeed the entire nation, witnessed one of the most unfortunate and regrettable incidents inside the Lok Sabha chamber,"" the letter stated.Detailing the alleged misconduct, the BJP MPs claimed that opposition MPs disrupted proceedings in an unprecedented manner.""We saw members of the opposition party not only entering the well of the House but also climbing onto the Speaker's table, tearing up papers, and throwing them towards the Speaker.Furthermore, sadly, some Honourable women members, behaving aggressively and carrying banners and placards, crossed over to the other side. They not only surrounded the Prime Minister's seat but also entered the Treasury benches where senior ministers sit,"" the letter said.“Therefore, we urge you to take the strictest possible action, under the rules, against those opposition MPs who have committed such heinous acts within the House premises and brought disrepute to our democratic institution,” it added.The BJP MPs’ letter comes a day after women MPs from the Congress wrote to Birla accusing him of acting under pressure from the ruling party to justify Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s absence from the House.The controversy stems from Birla’s statement in the Lok Sabha last week that he had received “concrete information” suggesting that several Congress members might approach the Prime Minister’s seat and carry out an “unexpected act.” The Speaker said he had, therefore, requested the Prime Minister not to attend the House to deliver his reply to the Motion of Thanks.In their letter, Congress women MPs strongly objected to the Speaker’s remarks and accused him of making baseless allegations.“Clearly pressured by the ruling party to defend the non-appearance of the Prime Minister, the Speaker issued a statement making grave allegations against the women MPs of the party,” the Congress MPs said.“We are being targeted simply because we have consistently fought against Prime Minister Narender Modi’s anti-people government and demanded accountability from him. His absence from the House was not due to any threat from us, it was an act of fear,” the letter added.The Congress MPs further rejected any suggestion that they had planned to disrupt proceedings.“He (PM) did not have the courage to face the Opposition. We are Members of Parliament from the Indian National Congress, a party that stands for love, peace, constitutional values, and human dignity. We do not believe in violence and intimidation. We are brave women elected representatives who will not be silenced by intimidation,” the letter, signed by MPs including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Jyothimani, R Sudha, Varsha Gaikwad and Jyotsna Mahant, stated.“We believe that transparency is the only way to restore the dignity of the Speaker’s office and the credibility of this House,” it said.The Congress MPs also alleged bias in disciplinary action, pointing out that eight INDIA bloc MPs were suspended at the “behest of the ruling party,” while a BJP MP was allowed to speak in a “vulgar and obscene manner” about former prime ministers.",Women mps from the bharatiya janata party (bjp) wrote to lok sabha speaker om birla.

"Read, think, don't scroll: PM Modi recalls learning from TOI in Pariksha Pe Charcha",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/read-think-dont-scroll-pm-modi-recalls-learning-from-toi-in-pariksha-pe-charcha/articleshow/128132083.cms,"NEW DELHI: Long before smartphones, search engines and AI entered classrooms, PM Modi said one habit shaped his thinking as a student - reading the newspaper and discussing ideas. Recalling his school days, Modi told students that a teacher once gave him a daily task rooted in curiosity and discipline. ""My teacher used to tell us daily, 'Go to the library. In The Times of India , there is a sentence on the edit page - write that in your notebook and come,' and the next day we used to discuss it,"" he said, underlining the role of reading and reflection in learning.The PM was speaking during the second episode of the ninth edition of Pariksha Pe Charcha 2026, where he interacted with students from Coimbatore, Raipur, Guwahati and Devmogra in Gujarat. Using personal anecdotes and simple examples, Modi urged students to build habits that strengthen thinking, rather than becoming dependent on shortcuts.Warning against overuse of technology, he said mobile phones have become ""masters"" for some children. ""Some kids cannot even eat food unless they are watching a smartphone or television,"" he observed. He said every era has faced fears over new technologies, but technology must not become the master of human life.On AI, Modi advised balance over blind dependence, saying AI should be used for guidance and value addition, not as a substitute for learning. He noted that nature of jobs will keep changing, just as transport once moved from carts to airplanes.The PM also shared practical tips for exams, stressing preparation and rest. He said a good night's sleep keeps students cheerful and encouraged practising previous years' papers and focusing on writing.He cautioned parents against encouraging comparisons at home, saying constant comparison creates pressure rather than motivation. On leadership, Modi said it begins with courage and initiative.Expressing happiness that students carry the dream of Viksit Bharat 2047, Modi said small habits build a developed nation. Launched in 2018, Pariksha Pe Charcha has grown into a major student engagement programme. The ninth edition, held this year, recorded participation from across the country, reflecting sustained student enthusiasm nationwide overall.","Pm modi urges students to build habits that strengthen thinking, rather than becoming dependent on shortcuts.

"ED forms SIT to probe Anil Ambani, summons wife",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-forms-sit-to-probe-anil-ambani-summons-wife/articleshow/128130890.cms,"On SC directive, CBI and ED may file multiple cases against Anil



NEW DELHI: Complying with the Supreme Court's directive, Enforcement Directorate has set up a special investigation team to probe money laundering cases allegedly involving Rs 40,000 crore against Anil Ambani and companies of Reliance Group.The move comes amid ED stepping up its probe against the industrialist. The agency was set to question his wife, Tina Ambani, on Monday at its HQ here but she did not appear and may be summoned again.The purpose of the planned questioning is to establish the money trail in a case related to purchase of an apartment worth Rs 70 crore in Manhattan, New York, for which senior Reliance executive and Ambani confidant Punit Garg was arrested last week.Tina Ambani did not appear and may be summoned again.Tina Ambani’s name came up during the custodial interrogation of Garg. With Supreme Court on Feb 4 asking for registration of separate cases in each case of the alleged diversion of bank loans by Anil Ambani’s companies, both CBI and ED are looking to file multiple cases against him. CBI, in particular, will be required to file many more since the allegations of fund diversion concern more than a score of loans he took from different financial institutions.The Manhattan apartment, sources suspect, had been purchased using alleged proceeds of crime siphoned off from the bank loans that Reliance Communication had received from an SBI-led consortium. ED has come across a network of shell entities involved in money laundering, including the one that received the sale proceeds ($8.3 million) of the Manhattan apartment “remitted from the US under the guise of a sham investment arrangement with a Dubai-based entity controlled by a Pakistan-linked individual”.So far, during its probe against Anil Ambani and his entities, ED has searched 46 premises and attached 204 properties valued at over Rs 12,000 crore. ED has registered three enforcement case investigation reports, equivalent to police FIRs, under PMLA against Ambani and his entities so far.One is against Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd (RCFL) and Reliance Home Finance Ltd (RHFL) in the Yes Bank money laundering case. The agency has told SC that RHFL had borrowed public funds from 33 banks/financial institutions and committed a default of over Rs 5,400 crore which constitutes proceeds of crime. The 33 lenders were able to recover only Rs 2,116.9 crore. “As regards the default committed by RCFL, 21 banks/financial institutions faced defaults of Rs 6,281 crore. Out of Rs 8,226 crore, only a sum of Rs 1,945 crore has been paid,” ED told the court. In second ECIR against Reliance Communications Ltd, ED has said total outstanding amount was Rs 40,185 crore that constitutes proceeds of crime. Third case is against Reliance Power Ltd in which allegedly forged bank guarantees were submitted. Three accused were helld in the case.“Having gone through ED’s counter affidavit, it appears to us that the aforesaid agency ought to look into every possible financial transaction which might have led to siphoning of funds and must determine the estimated value of the proceeds of crime. ED is well advised to constitute an SIT,” SC had said in its Feb 4 order. SC posted the matter for hearing on March 10.","On sc directive, cbi and ed may file multiple cases against anil ambani.

NEET-PG cut-off: Single-digit scores land PG seats in top med colleges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neet-pg-cut-off-single-digit-scores-land-pg-seats-in-top-med-colleges/articleshow/128086922.cms,"Removing cut-offs altogether risks patient safety , says doc



NEW DELHI: A steep cut in NEET-PG qualifying standards has led to postgraduate medical seats in govt colleges being filled at shockingly low scores - including in high-risk clinical specialties - triggering alarm across the medical fraternity, reports Anuja Jaiswal.The impact was stark in third-round PG counselling, where candidates secured seats in govt medical colleges with scores ranging from single digits to double digits, spanning both clinical and non-clinical disciplines. Even premier institutions and core clinical branches saw seats being allotted to candidates with such scores.An MS orthopaedics seat at a govt institute in Rohtak was allotted to a candidate with just 4 marks out of 800, while obstetrics and gynaecology at a premier Delhi medical college went to a candidate who scored 44 marks. A general surgery seat was filled at 47 marks.This signals a serious breakdown in medical education and workforce planning,” said a senior faculty member at a govt medical college. “Orthopaedics has traditionally been among the most demanding surgical specialties. Filling it at near-zero scores is a sign not of weaker students but a system under severe strain.”This happened following the sharp lowering of NEET-PG qualifying standards by Union health ministry for the 2025–26 academic session, with drastically reduced cut-offs across categories allowing candidates with extremely low — and even negative — scores to qualify.The effect was visible across disciplines. Seats were filled at 10 marks in transfusion medicine, 11 marks in anatomy, and minus 8 marks in biochemistry, many under reserved and PwD categories. While the revised cut-offs ensured that seats did not remain vacant, doctors warn the policy risks trading competence for convenience.“Allowing surgical and clinical branches to be filled at zero or near-zero percentile represents a serious erosion of standards,” said a senior doctor at a govt medical college. “Marks as low as 4, 11, 44 or 47 out of 800 point to a lack of basic aptitude. Removing cut-offs altogether directly risks patient safety.”The current policy marks a sharp shift from govt’s earlier stand. In July 2022, opposing a plea to lower NEET-PG cut-offs in Delhi HC, Centre had argued that minimum qualifying percentiles were essential to maintain education standards. The court agreed, warning that lowering medical education standards could “wreak havoc on society”, as medicine involved matters of life and death.Defending the present framework, a senior health ministry official said PG seats are allotted strictly under revised eligibility rules, and competence is intended to be ensured through training and exit exams, not entry cut-offs alone. Colleges are certified by regulators and are responsible for failing unsuitable candidates, the official said.Medical educators, however, say the trend reflects deeper structural problems — rapid seat expansion without a matching rise in trained faculty, overcrowded classrooms and eroding bedside skills. “Without strong faculty, robust exit exams and a system to weed out unsuitable candidates, anyone who enters medicine eventually gets a degree,” said a senior academician.Faculty members say the consequences are already visible. Many postgraduate students arrive without strong theoretical foundations, clinical skills or discipline. Pressure to pass students, weak exit mechanisms and over-reliance on online learning have further diluted training quality.“Easy entry has reduced seriousness even at top institutions,” said another doctor on condition of anonymity. “Numbers are rising, but training quality is falling — and that poses long-term risks to patient care.”Doctors caution that the branch of medicine does not reveal its failures immediately. Gaps in training today may surface years later, when these doctors practise independently — with serious implications for patient safety and public trust in the healthcare system.","A steep cut in neet-pg qualifying standards has led to postgraduate medical seats in govt colleges being filled at shockingly low scores.

'Women MPs Near PM's Chair': Speaker Om Birla Reveals Why PM Modi Skipped Lok Sabha Speech

NEW DELHI: Women MPs belonging to Congress told Speaker Om Birla Monday that under pressure from the govt, he made ""false, baseless and defamatory allegations"" that PM Modi faced potential threat from them, because of which he did not come to LS to reply to the motion of thanks.In a letter to Birla, the MPs said he made the allegations a day later under govt pressure ""to defend the non-appearance of the PM"", arguing that ""questioning our integrity is a attack on every woman who earns her place in public life with dignity and courage"".""His (PM) absence from the House was not due to any threat from us, it was an act of fear. He did not have the courage to face the opposition,"" said the letter, signed by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, S Jothimani, R Sudha, Geniben Thakor, Varsha Gaikwad and Jyotsna Mahant.Rubbishing the idea that women members could have indulged in violence, Rahul Gandhi told reporters if any member did threaten, the govt should file an FIR and arrest that MP.The letter questioning the Speaker's impartiality, with a remark like ""you are no longer the decision maker"", marks a sharp escalation of tension that has prevailed between the governing camp-Speaker and the opposition during the Budget session.""It is amply clear that you are under sustained pressure from the ruling party. We urge you once again to act as impartial custodian of the Lok Sabha,"" they wrote, adding, ""let history remember you as one who stood for what was right in the most trying circumstances... let it not remember you as one who bowed to pressure from those who leave no stone unturned in subverting constitutional values and damaging the democratic fabric of our nation.

Referring to its Jan 19 order directing the DGP, superintendents of police and collectors to maintain law and order at all cost, the bench said, ""We, therefore, direct the DGP to file a personal affidavit in response to EC's affidavit. We will take a final call with respect to the power of EC in this regard. Before doing so, we are giving the DGP an opportunity to file an explanation.""It was solicitor general Tushar Mehta who flagged the serious allegations in the EC affidavit detailing deliberate non-cooperation and inaction of the state govt coupled with an obstructionist stance and threats of violence given by TMC functionaries against EC officials.""A strong message must go that the Constitution applies in equal vigour to all states. Constitutional post holders cannot threaten EC officials,"" he said.EC counsel D S Naidu told the court that the state govt was not cooperating with it and not heeding its recommendations to act against state officials who committed illegal acts while under deputation to the commission for SIR work.While asking Pant to verify EC's allegations, SC said, ""EC shall be at liberty to replace the state govt officials on deputation for the SIR work but are not performing or acting contrary to instructions.""In its affidavit, EC said, ""While SIR is underway in 12 states, a controversy of the present nature where the ruling party in the state is actively involved in causing obstruction and issuing threats to officials is confined only to West Bengal.""""The material placed on record discloses that, through proper planning and concerted action, deliberate and systematic attempts are being made to derail, paralyse and frustrate SIR in West Bengal...

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court said Monday it would under no circumstance allow stalling of special intensive revision (SIR) of voter rolls in 12 states but said it was open to suggestions to ensure genuine voters are not left out, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.The CJI-led bench extended by a week the Feb 7 deadline for submission of documents by voters issued notice by EC, including 1.36 crore voters categorised under 'logical discrepancy'. It also sought a personal affidavit from the Bengal DGP on EC's charge of TMC functionaries making attempts to derail SIR. ""We hope the state remembers the laws of the land,"" it said.The bench of CJI Surya Kant, Justices Joymalya Bagchi and N V Anjaria, which had heard West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee passionately argue for discontinuing SIR, frowned upon the state govt for not providing the names of 8,500 group B cadre officials to EC for assisting electoral revision officers (EROs) and assistant EROs in the massive document verification work. The displeasure had a dramatic effect as the West Bengal govt provided the list within minutes to EC in the court and said it would verify the suitability of the officials.The court also dismissed the fear expressed by Banerjee’s counsel Shyam Divan who told the bench that the process adopted by EC would lead to mass exclusion of voters given the fact that 50% of the cases of voters facing “logical discrepancy” scrutiny are misspelling of names, which happened due to translation errors.“This is a speculative apprehension,” the bench said, and allayed it by saying suitable officials, inducted by EC from among the 8,500 officers provided by the state govt, would assist the EROs and AEROs about the cases where notices have been issued merely because of spelling errors in names and facilitate their inclusion in voter lists.Though the Bengal govt, represented by a battery of senior advocates, vehemently argued against engagement of micro-observers drawn from central PSUs and the Union govt, the bench said the micro-observers along with the additional hands provided by the state govt would help the EROS and AEROs even though the the final decision on inclusion or deletion of voters from the final list would be taken by the EROs only.Since the Feb 7 deadline for document submission, its scrutiny and hearing period is extended by one week, the scheduled publication of the final voter list on Feb 14 is likely to be extended by one more week, that is to Feb 21.Advocate Kalyan Banerjee alleged that thousands of anonymous complaints against inclusion of names in voter lists have been filed and have been entertained by EC even as the rules and regulations mandate that person filing complaint must remain present during the hearing.The bench said, “We are not going to regulate the internal mechanism of EC in dealing with such issues.” Senior advocate V Giri, appearing for Sanatani Sangsad, alleged that there is widespread violence and open threats being given to EC officials to derail the SIR work.“Thousands of objections to names in voter lists were burnt,” Giri said and requested the bench to allow filing of fresh objections during the extended period for filing documents.For West Bengal, Menaka Guruswamy told the bench that the organisation is managing temples and wondered how a temple management organisation would have locus standi to file such an application.",The cji-led bench extended by a week the feb 7 deadline for submission of documents by voters issued notice by ec.

Opposition mulling notice to seek removal of Lok Sabha Speaker,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-mulling-notice-to-seek-removal-of-lok-sabha-speaker/articleshow/128128589.cms,"NEW DELHI: The opposition is seriously mulling a notice to seek the removal of Speaker Om Birla as the Chair of Lok Sabha, with leaders of India bloc discussing the issue on Monday - a move that may further embitter the fraught relations between the governing camp and the opposition.Sources said a notice floated during the day has collected signatures of over 100 MPs. The Speaker can be removed by a resolution passed by the LS under Article 94(c) of the Constitution, and the resolution requires a 14-day notice.Sources said another meeting of the opposition parties has been called on Tuesday morning to take a final view on the matter, especially about the timing.Unfazed, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju made light of the opposition's plan, saying it lacks the numbers to carry the resolution.A possible resolution to the extreme step could be the Speaker's view on the opposition's demands Tuesday. Rahul along with T R Baalu, Akhilesh Yadav and Abhishek Banerjee met Birla after the House was adjourned prematurely amid protests Monday. The opposition grievances include lack of action against BJP MP Nishikant Dubey for his remarks, suspension of opposition members, and claim that women MPs posed a threat to the PM.As the India bloc partners gathered to discuss the strategy for Parliament in the wake of logjam in LS over repeated refusal of permission to speak to LoP Rahul Gandhi, sources said a senior Congress neta proposed a ""no confidence"" resolution against the Speaker.It elicited a nod from the gathering. However, TMC MP Shatabdi Roy reportedly said she would have to consult party supremo Mamata Banerjee before a reply. It was also proposed by TMC that the Speaker be first given a letter listing the grievances. However, ""it did not say no to the proposal once it was accepted"", a opposition neta pointed out. The meeting was attended by Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi, Ramgopal Yadav and Dharmendra Yadav (SP), John Brittas (CPM), N K Premachandran (RSP), T R Baalu (DMK), Sanjay Raut (Shiv Sena), K C Venugopal, Kodikunnil Suresh and Manickam Tagore (Congress), Mian Altaf (National Conference). NCP was not present.Sources said the notice with over 100 signatures was still to be signed by Trinamool and SP till the evening.It may be noted that the opposition discussed a no-confidence against then Chairman of RS Jagdeep Dhankhar for many months, but the issue came to fruition much later.Sources said while the matter was intensely discussed in the morning, a possible resolution was not ruled out. However, after Rahul was refused permission to speak at 12pm, a quick consultation among opposition parties ensued which reinforced the plan.",The opposition is seriously mulling a notice to seek the removal of speaker om birla as the chair of lok sabha. A meeting of the opposition parties has been called on tuesday morning to take a final view on the matter. The speaker can be removed by a resolution passed by the ls under article 94(c) of the constitution.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128128582,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1240894,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Banks must block suspect money transfers: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/banks-must-block-suspect-money-transfers-supreme-court/articleshow/128130704.cms,"Banks must realise they are trustees of public money: SC on online fraud

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday said banks must devise an AI-based mechanism to flag all suspicious transaction from an account, issue alerts, and suspend the transfer until the transaction is authenticated with the account holder.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant, Justices Joymalya Bagchi and N V Anjaria said the home ministry has flagged the alarming siphoning of nearly Rs 52,000cr between April 2021 and Nov 2025 through online fraud, including ""digital arrest"". The bench said the banks' IT applications devised for seamless transactions cannot be only profit-oriented and must be equipped to detect unusual transactions and verify genuineness.The direction comes against the backdrop of growing number of instances where bank personnel failed to act despite unusually large withdrawls from accounts of senior citizens who had long banked with them.Attorney general (AG) R Venkataramani said RBI has devised an SOP for banks to thwart cyber frauds. The bench asked the ministry to examine the SOP and notify them for pan-India implementation. Justice Bagchi said, “In the over-anxiety of making profits, banks must realise they are trustees of public money.People have deposited their monies in banks because they trust them. These banks are becoming a huge liability to the public. ” The CJI said that the courts are becoming recovery agents for the banks, whose officials, in collusion with industrialists, grant huge loans recklessly and then use NCLAT and other tribunals to recover money.The attorney general said the home ministry has constituted a high-level inter-departmental committee to comprehensively examine all facets related to ‘digital arrest’. The committee will work under the chairmanship of special secretary in the ministry. The court asked RBI to discharge its duties as the regulator of banking sector to ensure security of hard-earned money of retired people. “The problem is banks are more into business mode, and naturally so, and in doing that, they are becoming, either innocently or connivingly, platforms through which there is a swift and seamless transmission of stolen proceeds of crime,” bench said.","Banks must devise an ai-based mechanism to flag all suspicious transaction from an account, says supreme court.

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla has doubled down on his charge that PM Modi's safety faced a threat from opposition MPs in LS if he were to reply on Feb 4 to the motion of thanks on the President's address, refuting opposition parties' claim that his advice to Modi to call off his speech was devoid of merit and that there was no threat to him.While ""grave and unprecedented"" disorder unfolded in LS as the scheduled time of Modi's reply approached, several opposition MPs visited Birla's chamber where they resorted to using unparliamentary language and threatening remarks, including ""dekhte hain PM ka kya karte hain (let's see how they handle PM's address)"", LS secretariat sources said.Such conduct was wholly unbecoming of MPs and further underscored the volatility of the situation prevailing that day, they said.Inside LS, situation had worsened rapidly as some opposition MPs climbed onto tables, tore official papers, and hurled them towards the Chair, they said. ""These acts signified a breakdown of discipline and constituted one of the most unfortunate and undesirable episodes witnessed in LS, drawing widespread attention and concern both within the House and beyond, in India and abroad.""Amid these dramatic scenes in the House, several women MPs moved aggressively towards the designated seat of Modi and virtually cordoned it, they noted, recalling that some of them moved further along the treasury benches carrying banners and placards, adopting an ""openly confrontational"" posture.""They not only laid siege to the Prime Minister's seat but also advanced deep into the treasury benches, encroaching upon the space where senior ministers were seated, heightening the sense of disorder and insecurity within the House,"" they said.In view of this sequence of events, Birla had genuine and well-founded concerns regarding Modi's safety and the maintenance of order in the House, they said, stressing that this prompted him to advise Modi not to enter LS.",Lok sabha speaker om birla has doubled down on his charge that pm modi's safety faced a threat from opposition mps in ls.

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha discussion on the Budget continued to be mired in the standoff between govt and the opposition, with LoP Rahul Gandhi 's insistence on being allowed to raise a few issues and govt's refusal to heed his plea stalling the transaction of business for the sixth consecutive day on Monday. Amid the standoff, opposition netas Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav accused the govt of avoiding a discussion on the Budget because it feared questions about the Indo-US trade deal and its impact on farmers, even as BJP claimed the opposition did not want the budget debated.Rahul, SP's Akhilesh, TMC's Abhishek Banerjee and DMK's T R Baalu met the Speaker to find a solution to the logjam after the House was adjourned for the day. Later, Rahul said he would be allowed to raise some issues on Tuesday, after which the Budget would be discussed. Opposition is also seeking revocation of suspension of its MPs.On Monday, when presiding officer Sandhya Roy did not allow Rahul to speak and called Shashi Tharoor to start the Budget discussion, the opposition raised a protest. Rahul said the Speaker had committed that he would be allowed to speak and the Chair was going back on its word.But parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju contested his claim as ""not being 100% correct"". Rijiju said he was present in the meeting of the Speaker and K C Venugopal, and it was decided that Rahul should spell out the issues he wanted to raise so that if he made any allegations against the Speaker, the latter could reply. ""There was no commitment that only the LoP would be allowed to speak,"" he said.Rahul told reporters that his issues include not allowing the LoP and the opposition to speak on the motion of thanks while a BJP MP was allowed to speak ""wild stuff"", and suspension of MPs. He said the opposition is disturbed by the ""idea floated"" that the PM faced a threat inside LS. ""The PM was scared of coming to the House not because of members, but because of what I was saying,"" he said, referring to his announcement Wednesday that he would give the book of Army chief M M Naravane on Chinese aggression to the PM if he came to the House. Meanwhile, the opposition walked out of RS after Chairman C P Radhakrishnan did not allow LoP Mallikarjun Kharge to talk about Rahul not being allowed to speak in the LS.Casting doubts about the govt's intent to run the House, Akhilesh and Rahul said the opposition is keen on a discussion because of ""dheel"" in the trade deal given by govt to US.",Lop rahul gandhi's insistence on being allowed to raise a few issues and govt's refusal to heed his plea stalling the transaction of business for the sixth consecutive day on monday.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court cautioned on Monday constitutional court judges against assuming the role of domain experts and suggesting remedial steps and said it would be dangerous if they deviate from their primary duty to decide disputes as neutral umpires after considering rival submissions.The remark came from a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant, justices Joymalya Bagchi and N V Anjaria on a petition filed by Jharkhand Public Service Commission challenging the Jharkhand HC's decision to direct deletion of two questions and award of one mark to either of two options to a question attempted by candidates appearing in a preliminary test for recruitment of judicial officers.""Should a constitutional court assume the role of super-examiner just because the test was for recruitment of judicial officers and the question related to law?

Should he interfere in examination question papers and answer keys relating to recruitment in the field of biochemistry? HC judges must leave these issues to domain experts,"" he added.The bench said the HC, on the administrative side, had framed the questions in consultation with JPSC. ""The power of reappreciation/reconsideration of answer sheets must be uniform for all examinations and not only for judicial service tests.HCs cannot be super-examiners, and such issues must be left to domain experts,"" it said.""If that is so, it is necessary that the HC, while exercising its power of judicial review, should have referred the issue to the administrative side of the HC for constituting an expert committee to revisit the answer sheets and answer keys,"" the bench said.The bench asked the HC to set up an expert committee that will include subject experts, including those from the fields of law and English, to reevaluate the answer keys and answer sheets.When the counsel sought early resolution of the controversy, the bench asked HC to resolve it within two weeks and send a report to JPSC. The counsel said there had been no recruitment to Jharkhand judicial service for the last two and a half years.
