NEW DELHI: Counting of votes for the Bagaha assembly constituency in Bihar will begin at 8 am today, as the constituency awaits results amid keenly contested polls. The key candidates in the fray for the 2025 elections are BJP’s Ram Singh, INC’s Jayesh Mangal Singh and Jan Suraaj’s Nandesh Pandey.Bagaha is a General category assembly seat situated in Paschim Champaran district and forms one of the six assembly segments under the Valmiki Nagar parliamentary constituency. The constituency has been a BJP stronghold in recent years, although contests have remained competitive, particularly with strong INC and JD(U) showings.In the 2020 assembly elections, BJP’s Ram Singh won with 90,013 votes (49.51%), defeating INC’s Jayesh Mangal Singh, who secured 59,993 votes (33.00%), by a margin of 30,020 votes.In 2015, BJP’s Raghaw Sharan Pandey had emerged victorious with 74,476 votes (44.45%), defeating JD(U)’s Bhishm Sahani, who polled 66,293 votes (39.56%), by 8,183 votes.Bagaha has thus consistently witnessed close contests between BJP and INC candidates, with Jan Suraaj emerging as a new entrant in the constituency this year.According to recent exit polls, the NDA is projected to secure a strong performance in Bihar, with People's Pulse suggesting the alliance may win around 133–159 seats, while the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan could secure 75–101 seats.Smaller parties like Jan Suraaj are expected to have minimal impact, though individual seats such as Bagaha may see tighter contests.With Bagaha’s electorate increasingly engaged, the results are likely to be closely watched, reflecting both local dynamics and the broader political trend across Bihar. Voter turnout and the performance of new entrants like Jan Suraaj could influence the constituency’s outcome in 2025.","Bagaha is a general category assembly seat situated in paschim champaran district.

NEW DELHI: The stage is all set for Bihar assembly elections results 2025 that will be declared today. With a strong voter turnout and exit polls suggesting a possible return of the Nitish Kumar-led NDA government, all eyes are on the actual results.The counting will begin at 8 am, according to the Election Commission of India (ECI). As Bihar waits for the verdict, here's a look at the most talked-about fights.Sitting MLA: Tejashwi Yadav (RJD)A stronghold of the Lalu Prasad family, Raghopur remains one of Bihar’s most-watched seats. Tejashwi Yadav is eyeing a third straight win here. His main opponent, BJP’s Satish Kumar, lost in both 2015 and 2020, after holding the seat in 2010 as a JD(U) member.The seat made headlines this year when speculation swirled that Jan Suraaj’s Prashant Kishor might contest from here, but he didn’t.Sitting MLA: Chandra Shekhar (RJD)Known for its deep Yadav roots, Madhepura has never elected a non-Yadav MLA. Locals still quote the saying, “Rome Pope ka, Madhepura Gop ka”, meaning the head of Rome is the Pope, and the head of Madhepura is a Yadav.RJD’s Chandra Shekhar is seeking a fourth straight term, while JD(U)’s Kavita Saha hopes to rewrite history as the first woman and non-Yadav MLA from the seat.Sitting MLA: Mishri Lal Yadav (VIP)Singer Maithili Thakur’s political debut has made Alinagar one of the most talked-about constituencies this season. Her campaign, coloured by Maithili cultural symbolism and outsider debates, has drawn controversy. The seat, won by VIP in 2020, now sees Thakur take on VIP's ally and RJD’s Binod Mishra, who finished second in the last election.Sitting MLA: Dr C N Gupta (BJP)In Chhapra, Bhojpuri star Khesari Lal Yadav’s debut has turned the contest into a spectacle. The BJP has fielded Chhoti Kumari, hoping to retain the seat it has held since 2010. The campaign trail has looked more like a film set with stars from both camps joining rallies, from Tejashwi and Akhilesh Yadav to Ravi Kishan and Nirahua.Sitting MLA: Anant Singh (JDU)Mokama’s election season turned volatile after the killing of a Jan Suraaj supporter, Dularchand Yadav, allegedly by associates of JD(U)’s Anant Singh. Known as one of Bihar’s most notorious “bahubali” figures, Singh has switched parties multiple times, yet continues to win. Since 2010, he’s been MLA as a JD(U), RJD, and independent candidate, making him one of the most resilient faces in Bihar politics.Sitting MLA: Alok Ranjan (BJP)Traditionally a BJP seat, Saharsa swung to RJD in 2015 but could surprise again this time. The BJP’s Alok Ranjan faces a tough challenge from the Indian Inclusive Party’s Indrajeet Prasad Gupta, whose massive rallies, backed by the Pan and Tanti communities, pushed Tejashwi Yadav to bring IIP into the Mahagathbandhan fold.Sitting MLA: Awadh Bihari Choudhary (RJD)This is a heavyweight clash between the sitting MLA, RJD veteran Awadh Bihari Choudhary and BJP’s Mangal Pandey. In 2020, BJP’s Om Prakash Yadav came within a narrow 2% margin. Siwan’s legacy runs deep. It’s the birthplace of India’s first president, Dr Rajendra Prasad and the old base of strongman Mohammad Shahabuddin.Sitting MLA: Rajeev Kumar Singh (JDU)A symbolically charged seat this time, Nitish Kumar handed Tarapur to BJP leader Samrat Choudhary, ending JD(U)’s decade-long control. The seat is steeped in family history for Choudhary, whose parents both represented it earlier. RJD’s Arun Kumar Sah, who lost by a 2% margin last time, is hoping for a comeback.Sitting MLA: Chetan Anand (JDU)Chetan Anand, son of former MP Anand Mohan, won Sheohar last time but has since joined the NDA. This time, the JD(U) has fielded Shweta Gupta, while the RJD bets on Navneet Jha, grandson of veteran leader Raghunath Jha.Despite being allies under the INDIA banner, Congress and RJD are set to face each other head-on in several constituencies, exposing the uneasy truce within the opposition alliance. As a result, “friendly contests” are unfolding across the state. Congress and RJD will lock horns in Vaishali, Warisaliganj, Lalganj, and Kahalgaon, while Congress is also up against CPI(ML) in Bachhwara, Rajapakar, Rosera, and Biharsharif. These overlapping fights risk splitting the opposition vote in several key districts, a scenario that could benefit the NDA.","Bihar assembly elections results 2025 will be declared today.

'Message to world': Amit Shah vows strictest punishment for Delhi Terror Attack culprits

New Delhi: While terror strikes understandably dominate news headlines and public discourse for days, the sustained and tireless efforts and operations by the security agencies to foil terror plots and nip attack conspiracies in the bud, may pass off without due notice.For instance, the six months preceding the Delhi car blast have seen several actions by the agencies - against Khalistani terrorism, IS-linked terror conspiracies, anti-narcotics crackdown, and al-Qaida ideology-inspired radicalisation modules.The month of May saw a Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) module busted in Batla on May 20 in an intelligence-based action, leading to the arrest of six members linked to foreign handlers and a Pakistan-based mastermind. Similarly, on May 19, intelligence teams in Hyderabad arrested two IS-linked terror suspects with explosives. Earlier on May 11, a Jamaat ul Mujahideen-Lashkar-e-Taiba network linked to Pakistan was busted in West Bengal.In July, Gujarat ATS and partner agencies busted an Al Qaeda in Indian State (AQIS) module promoting 'Ghazwa e Hind' with connections across Gujarat, UP and Delhi. On July 11, terror hideouts in Poonch, J&K were raided by the Army and J&K police, leading to discovery of terrorist hideouts and recovery of IEDs, grenades etc.August saw NIA apprehending Vizianagaram module case accused Arif Hussain alias Abu Talib at IGI airport in New Delhi; he was involved in conspiracy to supply weapons via Nepal border. August also saw anti-Sikh terror actions with the busting of BKI-Bishnoi gang modules in Punjab and Rajasthan.In September, UP ATS arrested four persons for attempting to form a radical organisation called the Mujahideen Army, with an aim to overthrow the elected govt through violent jihad and assassinate Hindu religious figures. Also, Delhi Police special cell busted a pan-India terror module and arrested five terrorists.In October, a border arms and opium network was exposed in Punjab; a JeM module active in Andhra Pradesh, UP and Maharashtra neutralised; and 2.5 kg IED seized in Punjab. On Oct 27, an IS module 'Saut-ul-Ummah' was busted by special cell of Delhi police and two terrorists arrested.","Dismantled many networks over past 6 months by security agencies.

Candidates Party Votes polled Vote percentage Maithili Thakur BJP Binod Mishra RJD Biplaw Chaudhary Jan Suraaj Margin of difference

NEW DELHI: As counting began on Friday morning, all eyes are on Alinagar, where the BJP is attempting to win the seat for the first time since its creation in 2008. With Maithili Thakur leading in early trends, the BJP’s strategy to capitalise on her popularity and strong cultural appeal appears to be paying off.Thakur faces a direct contest with RJD’s Binod Mishra, who finished runner-up in 2020, and Jan Suraj’s Biplaw Chaudhary. The seat, falling under Darbhanga district and part of the Darbhanga Lok Sabha constituency, is in the General category.Political observers say the Alinagar outcome will indicate how far the BJP’s outreach through youth icons and cultural identity politics resonates in the region. Thakur’s candidature marks a strategic shift, with the party hoping her appeal among young and first-time voters could swing the seat its way.In the 2020 Bihar Assembly elections, the Alinagar contest was among the closest in the state. Mishri Lal Yadav of the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) had edged out Binod Mishra (RJD) by just 3,101 votes, securing 61,082 votes to Mishra’s 57,981.Five years earlier, in 2015, RJD’s Abdul Bari Siddiqui had comfortably won the seat with 67,461 votes, defeating his nearest rival by over 13,000 votes.With Thakur entering the fray, this year’s race has taken on a new dimension. The BJP is seeking to expand its base in north Bihar beyond its traditional urban and upper-caste strongholds. The RJD, meanwhile, is counting on its organisational network and caste arithmetic to retain its edge.Counting for all 243 assembly constituencies begins at 8:00am, and early trends from Alinagar are expected to set the tone for the broader Darbhanga region.",Counting for all 243 assembly constituencies begins at 8:00am.

A wider terror web

(With inputs from agencies)

The investigation into the deadly Red Fort blast that killed 13 people on November 10 has unveiled a chilling web of terror networks spanning Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Kashmir. As agencies sift through CCTV footage, encrypted chats, and forensic trails, a clearer picture is emerging of how a group of educated professionals allegedly plotted one of the most audacious terror conspiracies in recent years.The probe has exposed a “white-collar” Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM)-linked module led by doctors from Kashmir who used Al-Falah University in Faridabad as their base. The group reportedly received guidance from a handler in Turkiye, coordinated on encrypted apps like Signal and Threema, and planned multiple blasts across India.Police said the conspiracy was hatched inside Al-Falah University, a private institution in Faridabad. 2,900 kg of explosives were recovered from its premises and nearby locations. Three Kashmiri doctors — Dr Umar Un Nabi, Dr Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, and Dr Muzaffar Rather — were allegedly the masterminds. They stored ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, and sulphur in small quantities before assembling improvised explosive devices (IEDs).The trio used the campus’s laboratories and rented rooms for storage. Following the blast, the government ordered a forensic audit of the university’s finances and the Enforcement Directorate was asked to trace its money trail. The Association of Indian Universities suspended Al-Falah’s membership citing “irregularities”.The group was dubbed a “white-collar” or “white-coat” terror module because most accused were medical professionals. PTI reported that Dr Umar, who drove the explosives-laden Hyundai i20, was a 28-year-old doctor from Qazigund, Kashmir. Dr Muzammil and Dr Muzaffar were his close associates. Another, Dr Shaheen Sayeed from Lucknow, was accused of providing logistical support. Investigators found that they radicalised peers at Al-Falah, using Telegram and Signal for coordination. The police have sought an Interpol Red Corner Notice for Muzaffar, who fled India in August and is believed to be in Afghanistan.The plot’s international dimension was uncovered when investigators traced a handler in Turkiye, codenamed Ukasa. He allegedly acted as the conduit between the Delhi-based doctors and leaders of JeM and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind. Dr Umar and his associates had travelled to Turkiye in 2021–22, where they received ideological training. Ukasa reportedly instructed them on how to establish covert cells and communicate without detection. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is coordinating with foreign counterparts to track his digital footprint.CCTV footage analysed by Delhi Police, cited by PTI, revealed Dr Umar’s last movements. After leaving Faridabad, he was seen stopping for food near Nuh before entering Delhi through the Badarpur border. He looped across multiple areas — Okhla, Connaught Place, and Ashok Vihar — before parking near a mosque close to Asaf Ali Road, where he stayed for nearly three hours. Police believe he offered prayers and received instructions before driving toward the Red Fort Metro Station, where his car exploded at 6:52 pm.Investigators found coded notebooks and diaries from Room 13 and Room 4 at Al-Falah University, belonging to Dr Muzammil and Dr Umar respectively. As per PTI, the documents contained dates between November 8–12, coded names, and numerical sequences. The repeated mention of the word “operation” suggested detailed coordination. References to 25–30 individuals, mostly from Kashmir and Haryana, indicated a large, decentralised network. Police believe the diaries outlined phases of the operation, including procurement, transport, and execution.According to ANI, the module had planned simultaneous blasts in four cities. Eight suspects were to split into pairs, each assigned to one city. The targets were believed to include Delhi and Ayodhya, where an attack was allegedly planned around November 25 to coincide with Ram temple events. Each pair was to travel with multiple IEDs for coordinated strikes, mirroring tactics used in earlier JeM operations. Intelligence sources said at least two more vehicles — a red Ford EcoSport and a Maruti Brezza — were being modified for attacks.Police told PTI that the suspects pooled over ?26 lakh in cash, which Dr Umar managed for operations. The funds were used to purchase 26 quintals of NPK fertiliser from dealers in Gurugram and Nuh. This fertiliser, when mixed with chemicals, forms a key component of homemade explosives. A total of 2,900 kg of explosive substances were seized across Faridabad, confirming large-scale preparation. Authorities suspect additional funding from abroad, possibly routed via hawala channels linked to Turkiye and Pakistan.Dr Shaheen reportedly told interrogators that the attack planning coincided with the anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition on December 6. Officials suspect the date was chosen to trigger communal tension. The group referred to December 6 as “Operation D-6” in their notes, according to ANI. Investigators believe this symbolic choice underscores the ideological motivation of the JeM-linked cell. The timing, they said, reflected an intent to cause maximum national disruption and political impact.Delhi Police confirmed via DNA profiling that Dr Umar Un Nabi was the driver of the car that exploded. PTI reported that his leg was found trapped between the steering wheel and accelerator, confirming he was behind the wheel. His remains were matched with samples from his mother and brother at AIIMS. Investigators believe the explosion was premature — possibly triggered accidentally while he was assembling or arming the IED inside the car.As ANI reported, the Delhi blast is only the visible part of a larger conspiracy. The module had prepared plans for 32 vehicles to be fitted with explosives for coordinated strikes. Police recovered a red Ford EcoSport linked to Dr Umar and are searching for a missing Maruti Brezza. Over 350 kg of ammonium nitrate and traces of RDX have been seized so far. Investigators are now probing whether the group was preparing to form a new outfit aligned with ISIS’s India affiliates. The Home Ministry has ordered a multi-agency review, while calls grow for an all-party discussion in Parliament on the attack.",The investigation into the deadly red fort blast that killed 13 people on november 10 has unveiled a chilling web of terror networks.

All 24 injured in blast near RedFort being treated at LNJP; No discharges or referrals madeNew Delhi: A critically injured patient on a ventilator succumbed to his injuries on Thursday morning, taking the toll in Monday's blast to 13.Doctors at Delhi govt's Lok Nayak Hospital (LNJP) confirmed the death of Bilal (35), who, according to police, lived near Jama Masjid. However, some sources said that he was a resident of Kangan in Ganderbal, Jammu & Kashmir.Among the most severely injured victims brought to the hospital after the explosion, Bilal suffered an abdominal-penetrating injury along with nearly 70% burns, said a senior doctor who was involved in his treatment.He underwent surgery on Wednesday after shrapnel from the blast ruptured multiple internal organs. ""Despite the surgical intervention, his condition remained extremely critical, and he could not survive,"" the doctor added.All 24 injured are being treated by LNJP multidisciplinary teams, hospital authorities said. Six of them continue to remain critical, as teams of doctors fight to stabilise them amid one of the hospital's most challenging emergency responses in recent times.""There have been no discharges or referrals to other facilities as we have all experts and faculties here,"" an official said.Doctors performed another complex surgery on a patient on Wednesday to remove a piece of shrapnel that pierced his eye. ""The patient had a head injury and a sharp foreign object punctured and was lodged inside the eye, damaging the cornea,"" said a doctor.Since the patient was too critical to be shifted to Guru Nanak Eye Centre, a team of ophthalmic surgeons from the eye hospital was brought to LNJP instead. ""Eye surgeries require an operating microscope. We planned and conducted the procedure in the neuro operation theatre, where such microscopes are available,"" a senior surgeon said.The operation was successful, and the shrapnel was removed. ""The cornea has been repaired,"" the surgeon added.Ophthalmologists have now joined the existing team of surgeons drawn from general surgery, burns and plastic, orthopaedics, neurosurgery, anaesthesia and ENT departments.Over 50 doctors and support staff have been working round the clock in LNJP's 70-bed disaster ward since Monday night. The unit was activated within minutes of the explosion, and has treated victims with severe burns, fractures, head injuries and blast-related trauma.Speaking about the pattern of injuries, doctors said two kinds of trauma are common among blast victims - burns and ear injuries. ""Most have superficial-to-deep burns, especially on the face and extremities. Many suffer ruptured eardrums or temporary hearing loss due to the shockwave,"" a medic said.At least four patients were treated for pneumothorax - a condition in which a blast's shockwave causes air to leak into the chest cavity, leading to the lung collapsing. Several others suffered eardrum ruptures and pellet wounds, while a few had to undergo emergency amputations.The hospital has set up a temporary facility near the emergency ward to accommodate up to two relatives per patient. They will be given food.","A critically injured patient on a ventilator succumbed to his injuries on thursday morning, taking the toll in monday's blast to 13.

A day-long trail through Delhi

Meticulous planning revealed by CCTV mapping

NEW DELHI: Fresh CCTV visuals have provided new insights into the movements of Dr Umar Nabi, the main accused in Monday’s deadly explosion near Delhi’s Red Fort that killed 13 people and injured several others.According to PTI, the footage shows Umar entering the national capital through the Badarpur toll plaza around 8.02 am on November 10, driving a white Hyundai i20 later identified as the vehicle that exploded near the Red Fort that evening.Investigators said Umar, wearing a mask, was seen handing cash to the toll operator while repeatedly glancing toward the CCTV camera. A large bag, believed to have contained explosives, was spotted on the car’s back seat.Another clip, reportedly from a lane near a mosque close to Ramlila Maidan, shows Umar walking along a narrow stretch before turning briefly — the moment his face is clearly visible on camera. Police believe he visited the mosque to offer prayers before driving toward the Red Fort. “His repeated glances toward the CCTV camera suggest that he knew agencies were looking for him, and he was consciously monitoring his surroundings,” a senior police officer told PTI.Delhi Police have retrieved footage from over 50 cameras showing Umar’s car travelling through several districts before the explosion. He was first captured on the Delhi–Mumbai Expressway. Umar stopped for a meal at a roadside eatery and spent the night in his car before entering the capital the next morning.From there, his route covered multiple areas: from Southeast Delhi to the East and Central districts, then northward to Ashok Vihar in the Northwest District, where he stopped to eat. The footage later shows him returning to central Delhi and visiting a mosque near Asaf Ali Road before heading towards the Red Fort parking lot at 3:19 pm.Another CCTV footage showed Umar at Mewat Toll, Haryana, on 10 November.PTI reported that the white i20 was later seen in the Sunehri Masjid parking area, where it remained stationary for nearly three hours. Around 6:22 pm, the car exited the parking lot and was last seen moving toward the Red Fort Metro Station side. Barely half an hour later, at 6:52 pm, it exploded into a fireball amid evening traffic, shattering nearby windows and setting off panic in the area.Investigators have reconstructed Umar’s movements in detail, suggesting he travelled from Haryana to Delhi via the Delhi–Mumbai Expressway. Police sources said Umar halted several times on his journey — once at a roadside dhaba where he ate and another time at a mosque where he offered prayers. He reportedly spent the night inside his car before entering Delhi on Monday morning. “He seemed to have planned every step, including his entry and exit routes, to avoid detection,” a police source told PTI.The footage shows that Umar deliberately avoided arterial roads, instead navigating through crowded lanes and smaller routes to confuse surveillance or observe public movement. He appeared calm throughout, even stopping at eateries. Police believe he used these pauses to check his phone and possibly receive instructions.ANI also reported that Umar’s diaries, recovered alongside those of co-accused Dr Muzammil, mention dates between November 8 and 12 — suggesting the planning phase for the attack. The diaries reportedly list about 25 individuals, many from Jammu and Kashmir and Faridabad, hinting at a wider conspiracy.Forensic experts have since confirmed through DNA testing that Dr Umar Nabi was indeed driving the Hyundai i20 at the time of the explosion. His mother’s DNA sample, collected on Tuesday, matched remains retrieved from the blast site. “The DNA results confirm that it was indeed Umar who was driving the fateful vehicle,” a source told PTI.",Dr umar nabi is the main accused in monday's deadly explosion near delhi’s red fort that killed 13 people and injured several others.

Responding to Bhushan's remarks, the bench said, ""Let us not create an impression that it (hearing on the PILs) is becoming a fight between airlines.""The bench asked the civil aviation ministry to file its response to the PIL. Mehta said that contrary to claims of the petitioners through Bhushan, no blame has been placed on the pilots of the ill-fated plane.Justice Bagchi said, ""AAIB probe is to find out the causes behind the air crash and not to apportion blame on anyone.""The bench refused to entertain a PIL by a student, advising him to concentrate on his studies instead.","Pil seeks independent, fair and transparent inquiry into air india crash at ahmedabad.

Multiple IEDs, 32 Vehicles: Agencies Uncover Plan For Serial Car Explosions In Delhi Blast Probe

Brezza found near Tower 17 on campus

Faridabad: A third car, a Maruti Brezza , linked to the ""white coat"" module was tracked down on Thursday to the campus of Al-Falah university, triggering a search for explosives there by the bomb squad and giving investigators more evidence of a plot to attack multiple places using cars as bombs.The almost-brand-new car was registered this Sept in the name of Dr Shaheen Shahid, who is among two Al-Falah doctors arrested so far in the investigation. Their colleague from the department of medicine, Dr Umar Un Nabi, was the one who was in the Hyundai i20 that blew up near Red Fort, killing 13 people.Investigators had Wednesday found a Ford EcoSport, registered in Umar's name, at Khandawali village in Faridabad, setting off another hours-long scan for explosives. On Nov 9, the day police uncovered nearly 3,000kg of ammonium nitrate and other explosive substances from two rented places in Faridabad, a Krinkov assault rifle was found inside a Swift Dzire owned by Shaheen.Ammonium nitrate was bought from various dealers in Nuh district. Agencies have detained several sellers, among them Dinesh Kumar, who allegedly sold 300kg without asking the buyer any questions about its purpose.The ammonium nitrate stockpile was allegedly organised by Dr Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, who was arrested from Al-Falah on Oct 30, Muzammil was using the Dzire.Diaries and notes found in the rooms of Umar and Muzammil suggest the module was looking to blow up car bombs by hiring or buying vehicles across various locations, sources said. The EcoSport had traces of ammonium nitrate inside, suggesting it had been used to transport explosives - likely to the two rooms rented by Muzammil near the university, from where the main cache was seized.According to investigators, several of the doctors arrested or detained so far in the investigation were mentioned as aliases that they have successfully decoded. Among those who find mention is Adeel Majeed Rather, who was arrested from Saharanpur in UP earlier and led police to Muzammil.The Brezza was found parked near Tower 17 on the campus, where Muzammil had his quarters. ""The diaries contain detailed plans of targeting multiple locations across the country, with Delhi being the primary focus. They also reveal how the group pooled finances, and handed large sums to Umar to purchase explosives, fertilisers and other bomb-making materials,"" a source involved in the probe said. The module's strategy, according to the sources, hinged on mobility and secrecy. The doctors planned to acquire or hire several vehicles to avoid detection, using them both to transport explosives and eventually as car bombs.The investigation has also brought to light the role of Wasid, a resident of Dhauj village and close associate of Umar at the university. Wasid, sources said, was responsible for moving and hiding the cars used by the module.According to sources, it was Wasid who parked the EcoSport in a desolate area in Khandawali village, using his family connections to avoid suspicion. Wasid's brother runs a motor workshop in Dhauj, which may have facilitated the group's access to vehicles and mechanical expertise. Wasid was detained from the university on Thursday.""The doctors used their medical knowledge to handle dangerous materials. Vehicles were acquired, registered under different names, and moved between locations to avoid police scrutiny. The group conducted a recce in Delhi, likely using the EcoSport, before the i20 was detonated near Red Fort,"" an officer said.","Maruti brezza linked to 'white coat' module found on campus of al-falah university. Brezza was registered in name of dr shaheen shahid, one of two arrested doctors. Shahid's colleague, dr umar un nabi, was in the hyundai i20 that blew up near red fort.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125310140,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-84468,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
