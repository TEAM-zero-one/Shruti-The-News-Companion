Mystery of Agatha Christie's India story finally solved,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mystery-of-agatha-christies-india-story-finally-solved/articleshow/123877784.cms,"Agatha Christie autographs copies of her books

WHY DIDN’T THEY ASK MATHEW? There was constant speculation over whether Agatha Christie ever came to India, but never any proof, even though she was known to be an avid traveller. Now, her grandson tells writer Manjiri Prabhu that she definitely had visited — not once, but twice

The following are extracts from two letters that Christie wrote to Edmund Cork in Cyprus, her literary agent and lifelong friend.

Another letter was from Christie, then staying at the Ashoka Hotel in New Delhi, to Rosalind, her daughter.

From Delhi, she wrote again to Rosalind.

Some mysteries need to be actively cracked, but some solve themselves with time.There has been constant speculation about Agatha Christie’s India connection. One question has recurred over the years, but has never really been accurately answered: did Agatha Christie ever visit India? The internet and popular belief will state that she did not. I, too, had often puzzled over how Christie, a world traveller, had never actually been to India. In fact, in a video in 2021, I had even concluded that she indeed hadn’t.Until one cool but sunny Easter day in Wales.In March 2024, I met Christie’s grandson, Mathew Prichard, and his lovely wife Lucy, at their charming home in Wales. Prichard, now in his 80s, had been very close to his grandmother.It was a memorable day, but it turned momentous when Mathew showed me Christie’s personal memorabilia — her passports, her first typed and edited manuscripts, rare photos, her camera, and her last portrait painting, which hung on one of the walls of his house.When Mathew signed and gifted me a copy of his grandmother’s latest biography, I also realised what a mammoth task he had been entrusted with — to preserve her legacy, and how he had upheld that trust: a proud grandson of the Queen of Crime.It was when I mentioned how strange it was that Christie had never visited India, that he glanced at me with a twinkle in his blue eyes, and said, “Oh, but she did!” I was startled. This was contrary to all that we believed. A few minutes later, as I skimmed through the numerous black-and-white, well-preserved photos, I found some that made my heart race — pictures of Christie with a garland, descending from an Indian Airlines plane. Here, finally, was the missing link to a long-standing puzzle.I was on the threshold of solving a real mystery, but I needed to know more. At my request, the archivist Joseph Keogh dug deeper and came up with some fascinating, unpublicised facts. Christie had indeed visited India — not once, but twice. From her passport stamps, he traced her travel itinerary for the two trips.Her first trip was in Jan 1960, when she visited Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka), then India and Pakistan. From Jan 11 to Feb 2, she travelled to Bombay (now Mumbai), headed to South India’s Madras (now Chennai), did some sightseeing at the Ajanta Caves, and then on to Delhi. Between Feb 2 and 9, she went to Nepal and returned to Patna and Delhi, finally leaving for Karachi on Feb 17.Some letters were also found that referenced her trips. It appeared that the 1960 trip was for a lecture tour by her second husband, the archaeologist Max Mallowan.Future plans are, roughly, leave for Madras today — go via southern India to Bombay arriving 17th or 18th — Then some sightseeing near Bombay Agenta Caves (sic) etc and on to Delhi and then to Nepal on Jan 31st for a week — c/o British Embassy would find us there as I’m not sure what the hotel is.Our plans are a bit different at the moment as accommodation at hotels is very hard to get exactly when one wants it but we shall be in and out of the Ashoka Hotel at Delhi between Jan 28th and Feb 2nd — and then Nepal (c/o British Embassy Kathmandu) 2nd to 9th then in and out of Ashoka again finally leaving it on Feb 17th for Karachi. So forward anything you think I ought to see to the Ashoka at Delhi — but nothing that I needn’t!!On our arrival here yesterday evening, several archaeologists were waiting with two porters and loads of archaeological material from their… dig. The examination of same intrigued the Ashoka guests very much.Christie’s second trip to India, a year later, seemed to be for leisure. The passport has a Palam, New Delhi stamp (month not specified) in 1961. This time she visited Srinagar in Kashmir and stayed at the Oberoi Palace. This is what she wrote to her daughter Rosalind:Lake and mountains rather lovely. This is a Hotel rather like at Jaipur — converted Rajah’s Palace — miles and miles of corridors — enormous rooms and we are in a kind of supersuite looking over lake. It’s all terribly dried up by this time of year — one ought really to come in May-June. Now one must be content by rich beds of red salvia and dahlias in the Hotel garden. Temp is about 50 at night. Delicious hot sun to sit in and about 60 in day. Suits me very well. We made some excursions — to the various Mogul gardens — and to a lake… which is very beautiful and ringed with snowclad mountains. You can see the mountains now after the rain. We have to leave here and go to the Hotel in the town — but expect that our booking for Nov 2nd to Delhi will be all right.Here we are in the Ashoka. I’m glad we had a good ten days and in a perfect Hotel for old ladies (very few of them nowadays) where I could sit, in the sun — and look at a view like a Japanese print. Lovely! The letters revealed Christie’s bright, chirpy personality and tongue-in-cheek humour, her eagerness to explore India and her appreciation of scenic beauty. She seemed happy to be in India.But I pondered why her trips were not well-known. Was it because photographs were a rarity then or because she checked into the hotels in her husband’s name — or perhaps simply because Agatha Christie was a private person?Whatever the reason, I was thrilled with my discovery. That sunny day with Mathew, Lucy and Gwynnie the dog carried an extra fulfilling zing because of this exciting revelation.I had always sensed a deep connection to Agatha Christie. But being the chosen one to unravel the mystery of her India trips felt truly special.The author is an award-winning writer of mystery novels[Extracts and photographs used with permission from Mathew Prichard and The Christie Archive Trust.

The book that brought ponds back to life,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-book-that-brought-ponds-back-to-life/articleshow/123877830.cms,"The slim volume authored by Mishra, who passed away in 2016, was first published in Hindi in 1993

’s book has quietly sparked a revolution in water conservation across villages — one pond at a time

Chasing Indigenous Wisdom

Deep Impact

Why It Still Matters

What do you call a book that was first published without the author’s name on the cover, which has no copyright and encourages the reader to use it for free in any form, inspires common people to spend money from their own pockets and translate it, can be read in at least nine languages, including Marathi, Bengali, Tamil, and also in Braille, has been broadcast by at least 20 radio stations with over two lakh copies published, has almost become a holy book for water warriors and, yet, remains largely unknown to the educated public.Anupam Mishra’s ‘Aaj Bhi Khare Hain Talab (The Ponds Are Still Relevant)’ wasn’t launched in a farmhouse or nominated for major literary awards. But the book has become a movement. Spread over a frugal 119 pages, it reveals how ponds and lakes were fundamental to life and livelihoods across the country, and how their construction, preservation, and regeneration was embedded in community fabric — guided both by science and deeper philosophical values.First published by the Gandhi Peace Foundation in Hindi in 1993, the book continues to find fresh readers in new languages and forms. This year, it has been made accessible online in a disabled-friendly e-text, says Kailash Pande of Delhi Blind School.Ramon Magsaysay award recipient Rajendra Singh says that at a time when headlines rapidly shift from drought to flood, the book remains as relevant as ever. “The change in weather patterns is an outcome of climate change and global warming.The book shows how to adapt to and mitigate the current crisis,” says Singh, whose NGO Tarun Bharat Sangh also shaped Mishra’s early ideas.Aaj Bhi… was born out of Mishra’s extensive travels as a seeker and surveyor of India’s interiors in the 1980s. Mishra spoke less, listened more. A Gandhian by belief and environmentalist in action, he discovered a tradition of water-saving techniques in arid Rajasthan. In areas he couldn’t visit, Mishra sought the aid of friends and fellow travellers, naming each of them in the book. “The book harnessed indigenous water wisdom scattered across the country,” says social activist and old-time colleague Rakesh Dewan.At the turn of the 20th century, India had 11-12 lakh ponds, the book says. Mishra referenced the 1907 gazetteer to show that the princely state of Rewa in north-eastern Madhya Pradesh had 5,000 ponds. Early 20th century Madras Presidency was home to 53,000 ponds. Who would believe that in the early 20th century, Delhi had 350 ponds, as a 1930 map illustrates. Dewan says that officers posted to Jabalpur during the British Raj were advised not to bring fans because the ponds there ensured a cool weather.The book also details the craft of building ponds and devotes a chapter to their anonymous creators. Mishra illustrates how, for centuries, communities such as the Odhs, the Gonds, and the Ramnamis had dedicatedly constructed ponds. Such acts often cut across the caste spectrum. Building ponds was also part of the financial system. “Those who built ponds in the kingdom of Gond rajas got a tax break. This tradition was strong in Sambalpur region,” he writes.Digging ponds was among the punishments meted out by the caste panchayats of Bundelkhand. Ponds permeate every sinew of life.Many found the book addictive. Some finished it in one go and keep revisiting it. “People were mesmerised,” says Bhopal-based journalist Shabbir Qadri, who translated the book into Urdu and distributed it for free at madrasas and panchayats.Mishra, who passed away in 2016, would build a personal relationship with his readers. “I correspond with about 3,000-odd readers. The idea is to create awareness and build a movement through the book. You cannot do that without forming a long-standing relationship with them,” he told this reporter in 2004.One such reader was Surendra Bansal, then a freelance graphic designer in Punjab’s Malerkotla. He learnt about the book from a piece by journalist Prabhas Joshi in ‘Jansatta’ newspaper. “I read that article four times and wrote to Anupam-ji,” he says. “I didn’t have the address, so I just wrote, Anupam Mishra, Delhi”. Miraculously, the letter reached its destination. Mishra sent him two of his books with a hand-written note in his signature style.Bansal read the book and, then, translated it into Gurmukhi. He published it by selling off his prized cacti collection for Rs 11,000. “When Anupam-ji came to know about it, he first scolded me. Then he wept,” remembers Bansal, who now works for Haryana govt’s PR department. He has published five editions of the book in Gurmukhi. And he hasn’t stopped. Bansal regularly scans Punjabi magazines and sends free copies of the book to those he believes might be interested in water conservation. “I also distribute it to youth clubs and village libraries,” he says. Bansal has given away 6,200 copies so far.The book has also been used to groom community leaders. Aaj Bhi… was introduced as part of the syllabus in Chitrakoot’s Mahatma Gandhi Gramin Vishwavidyalaya. “It was taught to graduate students in 313 centres in a leadership course,” says retired civil servant B Rajagopal Naidu. The book was also part of the Hindi syllabus for graduates in Mumbai University between 2017 and 2019.Rajendra Singh, known as the ‘Waterman of India’, says Aaj Bhi… made a deep impact in MP and Rajasthan. Naidu, whose tenure as DM of Sagar in MP during 2002-04 was marked by a host of water management initiatives, says the book helped mobilise people and build awareness around check dams, and small drinking water ponds.He also remembers how the clean-up of Sagar’s sprawling Lakha Banjara lake got stuck due to a funds crunch. Help came in an unusual way. Film lyricist and Congress politician Vithalbhai Patel, who had penned the 1973 hit Bobby’s famous song, ‘Jhooth Bole Kawwa Kate’, went around every morning to the town’s different wards, asking people to donate Re 1 for the talab. The amount raised helped restore a huge portion of the lake.Such examples abound. Singh of Tarun Bharat Sangh, which constructed at least 7,500 ponds, says that dozens of initiatives were undertaken in Jodhpur and Barmer districts. “A sarpanch from Bikaner’s Nakhoda village called me after reading the book seeking help to build ponds,” he recalls.Chhatar Singh, a master of desert water conservation in Jaisalmer district, restored about 500 ponds, beris , and wells. A beri is a shallow well that harvests rainwater.“Reading the book I felt my forefathers were talking to me. It was written in a way that inspired action,” says Chhatar, who was also impressed by Mishra’s book, ‘Rajasthan Ki Rajat Boondein (The Silver Drops Of Rajasthan)’. He explains Mishra’s approach: “If you had any doubts about building ponds, Anupamji would organise a gathering. He knew the answer, but would let the answer emerge from us.”Eastern Rajasthan’s Lapodia village is a famous conservation success story. Its head Laxman Singh read Aaj bhi… and encouraged fellow villagers to do so too. Impressed by its message of reviving traditional methods, they undertook a textbook application of rainwater harvesting and water management techniques to transform a sun-dried area into a village of three fecund ponds — Dev Sagar, Phool Sagar, and Anna Sagar, with a 300 bigha meadow.Laxman Singh says Mishra visited Lapodia twice every year for 30 years. “He was our guide and guru. Pehle woh insaan taiyar karte thhey, phir dharti (First, he readied people, then the land),” Laxman told this reporter in 2016. When the book’s Braille edition came out around 2009, Mishra visited Delhi Blind School, inspiring students to perform shramdan, or voluntary labour, recalls Pande.Academic Annie Montaut, who has translated ‘Rajasthan Ki Rajat Boondein’ into French, writes how even prisoners of a French jail could relate to Mishra’s lecture on water conservation. Some recalled their own childhood in Morocco. “I was surprised by the reaction, he wasn’t. Anupam-ji told me that he had learnt a lot from the uneducated,” she wrote in Hindi to Mishra’s wife, Manjushree, for an upcoming book in tribute to her husband.It is almost a cliché that a book can change your world. Mishra’s slim volume certainly reaffirms that adage. With global water shortage now an impending reality, the book’s significance has magnified in recent years. Today Aaj Bhi… is to water conservationists what Das Capital is to Marxists. A ratna of Bharat, Mishra never received even a Padmashri. But his book continues to usher in a silent revolution, one pond at a time.","Anupam mishra’s ‘aaj bhi khare hain talab (the ponds are still relevant)’ wasn’t launched in a farmhouse or nominated for major literary awards.

Govt seeks to curb misuse of tourist permit scheme through NE registrations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-seeks-to-curb-misuse-of-tourist-permit-scheme-through-ne-registrations/articleshow/123877731.cms,"AI image

New Delhi: Haven't you noticed the many long-route luxury buses with AR and NL registration numbers? Private bus operators often register them in smaller states like Arunachal Pradesh (AR) and Nagaland (NL) under the All India Tourist Permit (AITP) scheme, where taxes are lower.To curb this practice, gov plans to make it mandatory for all AITP buses to make at least one trip every 45 days to the state where they are registered.In a draft notification introducing major reforms to AITP Rules, the road transport ministry has proposed stricter registration norms and a requirement for operators to clear pending highway tolls within 30 days for permit renewal.State transport authorities must verify operators' documents to ensure such operators have a residence or place of business in the state where the tourist vehicle is registered,"" according to the draft.The proposal also specifies that each tourist vehicle must either begin or end its journey in its home state and cannot remain outside for more than 45 days. All such vehicles must have active Vehicle Location Tracking devices, with movements monitored by respective states. ""This is essential to ensure they visit their home state as per norms,"" an official said.The scale of the issue is evident. In Arunachal Pradesh, nearly 5,100 of its 10,200 registered buses have AITP.Nagaland counts about 3,100 AITP buses among its total 6,700.Industry insiders say high concentration of AITP buses in these smaller states highlights the loophole. ""Such operators create unfair competition for those registering in bigger states where taxes are higher. They strain infrastructure in states where they operate without contributing proportionate taxes,"" said one.",Private bus operators often register them in smaller states like arunachal pradesh and nagaland.

T'puram: In a first in India, Kerala cabinet Saturday cleared a draft bill to amend Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, authorising the chief wildlife warden to order the killing of any wild animal that attacks and injures a person in a residential area.The move comes amid a series of reports of man-animal conflicts in recent months. ""The central govt and National Tiger Conservation Authority issued an SOP on Jan 30, 2013, detailing how to handle tigers that enter human habitats. Guidelines for handling elephants are also in place. These impractical provisions in the central law and the SOP act as obstacles to killing dangerous wild animals even in emergency situations.

'She sold her TV to make a film': How a Purulia girl became Venice winner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/she-sold-her-tv-to-make-a-film-how-a-purulia-girl-became-venice-winner/articleshow/123877149.cms,"When filmmaker Anuparna Roy was a child, she listened wide-eyed as her grandmother spoke dreamily of a river. Her maternal grandmother, married at nine to a man in his 30s in Purulia district of West Bengal, often told her stories about the river's pure, beautiful water. ""I always thought she must have seen this river, but after she died, I came to know that she actually never did. Only her dead body was taken to a riverbank,"" says Roy, 31, on a Zoom call from Mumbai, two days after she returned - triumphant and tired - from the 82nd Venice Film Festival. There, she became the first Indian to win the Best Director Award in the Orizzonti (Horizons) section, joining a prestigious list of acclaimed auteurs.Those stories shaped Roy's 2023 debut short film 'Run to the River', which is based on her grandmother's life in British-era Bengal. ""The protagonist is a Dalit girl married to a revolutionary freedom fighter. But even though he was fighting for his country's freedom, he failed to provide freedom to his wife,"" she says. This weaving of family memory with larger social and political contradictions defines Roy's cinema.Her Venice win came with her debut feature 'Songs of Forgotten Trees' (SOFT), which follows two migrant women in Mumbai - a part-time sex worker and a call-center employee - who begin as strangers sharing a room, but slowly forge a quiet kinship.Born to a coal-sector worker and a homemaker, Roy is now celebrated as a grassroots-to-grandeur story, rising from a Purulia village to an internationally recognised filmmaker. Without film school training, she juggled IT and call centre jobs to fund her films. Yet she is wary of the ""struggle"" narrative. ""I was doing jobs to support myself and my family. To talk about liberation in my films, I first had to liberate myself economically,"" she says. Her remote IT job even helped during the shoot of SOFT: ""It was work from home. I would log in and then go off to shoot. I even received a message from my ex-manager saying he was proud of me. It was generous of him not to mention the kind of activities I used to do while 'working.' I was pathetic at that job!"" she laughs.Roy's work is driven by memories of survival and discrimination in rural India. Her latest film references a childhood friend, Jhuma Nath, whom her father forbade her to meet because she was Dalit. Married at 13, Jhuma left a deep impression on Roy. Other moments of gender bias also stayed with her - from girls being given rice in school when boys got books, to being told to cover her nose while passing a tribal village. Her grandmother's story also inspired the female kinship angle in SOFT. ""My grandmother, when she entered her marital home at nine, had a stepdaughter of the same age. The two bonded well, and after my grandfather died, these two women ran the family together. One earned, the other cooked and cared for four daughters. I began to imagine why they couldn't also fall in love with each other. That idea became the foundation of the film,"" Roy explains.Literature was her early training ground: James Joyce and Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay influenced her while she studied English (Hons) in Asansol. Her 21-year-old cousin Adrija, who took up the same subject because of her 'dear didi' recalls, ""She struggled so much, sold her belongings, exhausted all her energy and money. She even sold her TV while making her short film."" Producer Bibhanshu Rai describes her as ""stubborn and persistent,"" crediting her resourcefulness in bringing SOFT to completion.Roy is part of the new wave of Indian cinema centering women's agency and sisterhood, alongside names like Payal Kapadia. ""My next project will return to my grandmother's story, where the freedom struggle plays out alongside the bond between my grandmother and her stepdaughter,"" she says.As for advice to young, independent filmmakers from small towns, she offers a note of encouragement: ""Those who are writing a script and are not able to finish it, or not able to find a producer, they are already filmmakers for me. They're trying to make something, and I know they will because they'll always find a way.""",Anuparna roy is the first indian to win the best director award at the venice film festival.

Police had blocked the road while diverting traffic on the other lane. The truck, which had been moving towards Holenarasipura, jumped over the median and crashed into the crowd of devotees around 8.30pm.Villagers claimed the truck driver ended up hitting the procession, which was to end in five minutes, to avoid a biker.The wounded were rushed to Hassan Institute of Medical Sciences and other private hospitals in the district, about 20km away.More than 20 others were injured and are undergoing treatment.Karnataka chief minister Siddaramiah said he was “deeply saddened” by the tragedy and announced financial support for the victims’ families.""It is deeply saddening to learn news of several people losing their lives and over 20 others seriously injured when a lorry collided with a procession heading for Ganesh immersion in Hassan.

'Violation of women's dignity': BJP acts over AI clip of PM Modi's mother; FIR filed against Congress leaders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fir-registered-against-congress-leaders-over-al-video-of-pm-modis-mother/articleshow/123870239.cms,"Screengrabs from the AI video shared by Bihar Congress

NEW DELHI: An FIR has been registered in Delhi against Congress leaders over the circulation of an AI-generated video featuring Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his late mother, Heeraben Modi, news agency ANI reported.The video, shared on September 10 by the official X handle of the Bihar Congress, was described in the FIR as “maligning and defaming image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his late mother gross violation of law, morality, and women’s dignity.”The case was filed under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, following a complaint by BJP Delhi election cell convenor Sanket Gupta.While filing the FIR on Friday, Gupta alleged that the AI video, which shows PM Modi dreaming of his late mother criticising his politics in poll-bound Bihar, was designed to tarnish the Prime Minister’s image and insult his mother’s memory.The AI video drew shrap reactions from the Bharatiya Janata Party. Party president JP Nadda accused the opposition of stooping to “irresponsible” and “power-hungry” tactics. He warned that Congress would receive “a befitting reply from the people of Bihar.”“Abuses were hurled at the late mother of Modi, by someone who was understood to have been instigated by the Congress and its allies. Now, the latest video of the Congress confirms that they have a filthy mindset,” Nadda said.BJP MP Anurag Thakur also condemned the video, saying, “The mother’s place is the highest in everyone’s life, but Congress and RJD have stooped so low that they abuse the Prime Minister’s late mother and post a bad video, which shows Congress’ mindset. Is it necessary to stoop this low in politics and abuse someone’s mother?”The Congress, however, has defended itself, arguing that the video was not disrespectful. “What is their objection? Just because a mother is trying to educate her son to do something right, where is the disrespect? This is neither disrespectful to the mother, whom we respect dearly, nor to the son,” said Pawan Khera, head of the party’s media and publicity department. He later told ANI, “Why does the BJP try to make an issue out of everything and try to generate fake sympathy? Mr Modi cannot do a ‘touch me not’ politics. ”","Fir has been registered in delhi against congress leaders over the circulation of an ai-generated video featuring prime minister narendra modi and his late mother, heeraben modi.

Earlier, the Ahmednagar district was renamed as Ahilyanagar district, PTI reported.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar , who had pursued the matter, thanked Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw for granting the approval.Chief inmister Devendra Fadnavis and deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde were also involved in the efforts, a statement from Pawar’s office said.Last month, Pawar had written to Vaishnaw urging that the station be renamed to align with the city’s new name.“This long-pending demand has now been fulfilled. The renaming holds special significance as we are celebrating the 300th birth anniversary year of Punyashlok Ahilyadevi Holkar,” Pawar said.Several organisations and citizens had been demanding that the railway station’s name be changed after the city was renamed Ahilyanagar.Pawar also said efforts are underway to rename Aurangabad railway station as Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar railway station.Earlier, a similar thing was done by Karnataka government but that didn't go well with Fadnavis. The Congress government in Karnataka moved to rename Shivajinagar metro rail station in Bengaluru after St Mary.Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah recently said his government would consider renaming Bengaluru's Shivajinagar metro station after St Mary following a request made during the annual feast at St Mary's Basilica. His deputy DK Shivakumar had claimed there is nothing unusual in responding to such community requests.Talking to reporters here, Fadnavis said, ""I condemn the Karnataka government's move to rename Shivajinagar metro station in Bengaluru after St Mary. Its an insult to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The Congress has continued its tradition of insulting the Maratha warrior king since the time of Nehru who made comments against Shivaji Maharaj in his book Discovery of India."" Fadnavis said he was praying that the Almighty gives Siddaramaiah sense to not go ahead with such a decision that is based on religion and was against the Maratha warrior king.","The government is changing the station name to ahilyanagar railway station.

PM Modi Appeals For Peace And Unity In His Speech During First Visit To Manipur Since 2023 Violence

What is the ‘PM Neem corridor’



NEW DELHI: Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit on Sunday, a special 2.6-km corridor lined with Neem saplings has been prepared in Numaligarh, Assam’s Golaghat district.PM Modi will pass through the ‘PM Neem Corridor’ on his way to the Numaligarh Refinery , where he is scheduled to inaugurate a bamboo-based ethanol plant worth over Rs 5,000 crore.“On September 14, as the Hon'ble Prime Minister makes his way to the venue in Golaghat, he will be welcomed through the PM Neem Corridor - a 2.6km corridor planted with neem saplings,” Assam’s chief minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, said through a post on X.“A Green Tribute to India's biggest green warrior - Adarniya @narendramodi ji,” he added.During his visit, the Prime Minister will also lay the foundation stone for the Petro Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit, which is designed to produce 360 KTPA of propylene.Later on Sunday, he is scheduled to address a public rally at the Numaligarh Tanker Stand, marking the second day of his two-day visit to Assam.A “Neem Corridor” has been created by planting around 700 neem trees along both sides of a newly constructed 2-km road stretching from Letekujan, where a helipad has been built for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to the event venue near Numaligarh Refinery Limited in Golaghat district.The initiative, led by Khumtai MLA Mrinal Saikia, saw the chief minister also plant a seed during his visit last week to review preparations for the PM’s visit.Saikia, who has taken personal responsibility for nurturing the plants until they mature, said neem was chosen for its natural air-purifying properties and environmental benefits. “Neem improves air quality by removing toxins and offers a host of health, agricultural, and ecological advantages,” he said.“To honour the PM, who deeply values nature and greenery, I decided to plant neem trees along the entire 2-km stretch from the helipad to the venue,” Saikia added. He also mentioned that neem trees help stabilise soil and act as mosquito repellents, reducing disease risks. “Neem is a cornerstone of Ayurvedic medicine, often referred to as nature’s pharmacy. Every part of the tree — leaves, bark, seeds, roots — is used in home remedies and contributes to overall health and hygiene,” he said.Modi’s visit to the state, originally planned for September 8, was rescheduled to September 13 due to the vice-presidential elections.PM Modi arrived in Guwahati on Saturday for a two-day visit to Assam, during which he will attend a special tribute to legendary singer Bhupen Hazarika, officials said, as cited by PTI.On Sunday, he is scheduled to inaugurate and lay the foundation stones for projects totaling over Rs 19,000 crore.","Pm modi will pass through the ‘pm neem corridor’ on his way to the numaligarh refinery.

Noida hostel firing incident: Gunshot kills 22-year-old student,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/noida-hostel-firing-incident-gunshot-leaves-22-year-old-student-dead/articleshow/123794605.cms,"NOIDA: A 22-year-old student was found dead with a gunshot wound in the head while his close friend lay critically injured with a similar wound inside a private hostel room in Knowledge Park in Noida on Tuesday morning. Police are trying to piece together how the gunshots were fired and what led to the shooting as the two students were considered ""inseparable"" by friends.The incident occurred around 10.30am at RCI Vidya Vihar hostel in Knowledge Park-III. The two students - Deepak Kumar (22) from Andhra Pradesh and Devansh Chauhan (23) from Agra - were both enrolled in the PGDM programme at Birla Institute of Management Technology (Bimtech). They were, however, not roommates. It was in Kumar's room where the shots were fired. Chauhan is in Kailash hospital. His condition is critical.Both bullets came from the same licensed revolver, which was fully loaded and belonged to Chauhan's father Surender Singh Chauhan, who retired as a circle officer in UP STF on Aug 31. Chauhan, who went home last Saturday to attend his father's farewell party, is believed to have sneaked the gun out when he left for his hostel on Tuesday morning itself.Chauhan had reached the hostel barely a couple of hours before the incident.""He had come home on Saturday to attend our father's retirement party. On Tuesday morning, he returned to college. He left home around 5.30am and reached his hostel by 9am. It was around noon that we received a call from the college authorities about the firing incident,"" said Shivang Chaurasia, Chauhan's brother who lives in Gurgaon.Surender Chauhan told TOI he kept the gun in a cupboard in his room. ""It was only a few hours since Chauhan left home. I didn't realise that the gun was missing too.""At Vidya Vihar hostel, it was a guard who first sensed something amiss after hearing faint groans from the locked room. Unable to get any response, he alerted the hostel warden. After repeated attempts to open the door failed, some staff members climbed to the rear balcony with a ladder and peered inside. What they saw was shocking. Inside, Kumar lay dead. Chauhan was groaning in pain.According to the chief medical officer of Kailash hospital, the bullet lodged in Kumar's head was fired from the right side. ""The boy suffered brain death,"" he said.In Chauhan's case too, the bullet was fired from the right. ""The revolver had six bullets. Two were used, four remain. No official complaint has been filed yet,"" the investigating officer said.A police team arrived at the hostel around 11.30am and secured the area. Forensic experts recovered the revolver, four live cartridges, and two bullet shells. They also seized the students' mobile phones, laptops, and other personal belongings from the room.While the exact sequence of events is unclear, police are examining the possibility of a confrontation between the two students.Bimtech did not respond to requests for a comment.","Deepak kumar (22) from andhra pradesh and devansh chauhan (23) from agra were both enrolled in the pgdm programme at birla institute of management technology (bimtech) the two students were considered ""inseparable"" by friends.

NEW DELHI: Delhi govt is preparing to move National Green Tribunal seeking permission to dredge the Yamuna riverbed in the city. The decision has been taken as Delhi has faced urban flooding repeatedly and the Yamuna's water-carrying capacity has shrunk here.Minister Parvesh Verma said the proposal was aimed at reviving the river's natural flow, easing pressure on regulator drains and enhancing flood resilience of low-lying neighbourhoods along its banks.Dredging involves excavation of accumulated silt, sludge and solid waste from a waterbody. This is usually avoided in a river for concerns related to damaging the ecosystem and disturbing its banks.""Currently, the dredging of the Yamuna is prohibited. We are planning to approach NGT for approval. We are building our case with documentation regarding the need and commitment to follow all environmental norms. Once permission is granted, a detailed project report will be prepared. This will directly increase the carrying capacity of the river,"" said Verma.The urgency of the proposal comes against the backdrop of this year's flooding that pushed up the water level and triggered backflow into the city's drainage channels.Several residential colonies near the floodplain, including those adjoining regulator drains, bore the brunt. Experts have often linked the crisis to the Yamuna's reduced depth, aggravated by unchecked siltation and untreated sewage inflows.The river's Delhi stretch is about 22km between Wazirabad and Okhla. Officials acknowledge that the ecological degradation of this critical stretch has complicated not just flood management but also the city's drinking water supply.Parallel to the dredging proposal, Delhi Jal Board has been working on desilting projects to augment the raw water storage capacity. A plan to clean up the Wazirabad pond, which supplies water to one of the city's largest treatment plants, had to be deferred due to the monsoon. The Wazirabad water treatment plant produces 138MGD, making it a crucial lifeline for the city.Officials believe that clearing the pond and dredging the Yamuna can together double the river's current water-holding capacity. This could help mitigate flooding, improve raw water availability and ease stress on downstream regulators, they added.","Dredging involves excavation of accumulated silt, sludge and solid waste from a waterbody.

This court has time and again emphasised that liberal condonation of delay on behalf of the state, merely on the ground that refusal might cause the dismissal of a potentially meritorious matter, is a misplaced proposition.Public interest is not synonymous with the cause of the govt; it is, instead, synonymous with the enforcement of rule of law, certainty in legal rights, and an administrative machinery that functions with diligence and accountability"".""It must, therefore, be underscored that the guiding principle is not the protection of governmental indifference but the promotion of responsible governance. The state is under a higher duty to act in time, for in every matter it litigates, it does so not in its private capacity but as the trustee of the people's interest. Hence, repeated indulgence in condoning delays on grounds of bureaucratic inefficiency would amount to eroding the very object of limitation statutes, which are enacted in every civilised jurisdiction for the sake of finality, certainty, and public order,"" the bench said.The litigation in the case between the board and a private person over a piece of land started 36 years ago in 1989.
