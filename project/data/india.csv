'No coincidence': Amit Malviya targets Pawan Khera's wife over 2 voter IDs; drags in Sonia's 1980 entry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-coincidence-amit-malviya-targets-pawan-kheras-wife-over-2-voter-ids-drags-in-sonias-1980-entry/articleshow/123667790.cms,"Pawan Khera and Amit Malviya (R)

NEW DELHI: BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya on Wednesday intensified his attack on the Congress, this time targeting Pawan Khera's wife and Congress leader Kota Neelima. Malviya alleged that Neelima holds ""two active EPICs - one registered Khairatabad and another in New Delhi. ""He also hit out at Rahul Gandhi, saying the Congress leader held a press conference without ""adequate due diligence."" Malviya claimed Rahul “targeted and tarnished honest voters — even putting them at risk by revealing their identities without consent. He doxxed young, upwardly mobile professionals and poor daily wagers who had moved cities in search of better opportunities.”Referring to Rahul’s earlier allegations of “vote chori” and claims that the Election Commission was “colluding with the BJP” during recent assembly elections, Malviya added: “Yet, he has maintained an equivocal silence on the shocking revelation that his close aide holds two EPIC cards. Is he the only one? Apparently not.”Malviya further alleged that “it’s now quite obvious” that Congress leaders hold multiple voter IDs across constituencies. “This is no coincidence,” he said, also drawing Sonia Gandhi into the row: “The rot isn’t limited to Pawan Khera and family. It goes back to the top — when Sonia Gandhi, an Italian, managed to get her name included in the voter list in 1980.”This fresh round of accusations comes a day after Malviya had claimed that Pawan Khera himself held two EPICs.Following that, the Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) of New Delhi issued a notice to Khera, stating that his name appears in both the New Delhi and Jangpura constituencies, and asked why action should not be taken against him.Khera, however, hit back at the Election Commission, alleging bias. He said the poll body functions “to support the ruling regime” and questioned why no notice had been issued to “the 1,00,000 fake voters of Mahadevapura constituency” in Karnataka, as highlighted earlier by Rahul Gandhi.","Bjp it cell chief amit malviya attacks congress leader kota neelima.

"Bengal differs with TN in SC, asserts governor's discretionary powers on bills",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bengal-differs-with-tn-in-sc-asserts-governors-discretionary-powers-on-bills/articleshow/123667690.cms,"NEW DELHI: Partly differing with another opposition-governed state Tamil Nadu and somewhat concurring with the Centre's stand on the Presidential Reference in the Supreme Court, West Bengal on Tuesday said the Constitution conferred some amount of discretionary powers on governors in dealing with bills presented to him after being passed by state legislatures.When senior advocate Kapil Sibal was prefacing arguments on behalf of West Bengal after conclusion of senior advocate A M Singhvi's pithy opposition to Presidential Reference, a bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar asked a pointed question - ""Do governors have discretion in exercise of options provided under Article 200 of the Constitution in relations to bills? How does he decide to take recourse to one of the four options?""The question assumed importance as opposition governed states - TN, WB, Karnataka, Kerala, Telangana and Punjab - have joined ranks to oppose the Presidential Reference. Singhvi had vehemently argued that a governor, being merely ornamental head of executive in a state with no legislative function, is always bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers led by the CM, even in exercise of options - granting assent to a bill, withholding it, returning bill for reconsideration by the legislature or reserving it for President's consideration.For TN, Singhvi elaborated upon his argument by listing possible scenarios: If the council of ministers feel that it is not the appropriate time to make a bill a law given the situation in the state, then it can advise a governor to withhold assent for sometime; if it felt that a Bill was passed hurriedly and required some changes, then it would advise him to return it to legislature for carrying out the changes; and if it felt that the law may be repugnant to central law, it can advise a governor to reserve it for President's consideration.Sibal, appearing for West Bengal, disagreed and said a governor certainly has some discretion under Article 200. ""A governor, while exercising the options of returning a bill to legislature, or reserving a bill for President's consideration, is not bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers and takes a decision on his discretion,"" he said.He said, ""Governor is certainly not a postman (to do whatever is told to him by the council of ministers). Otherwise why have a governor at all? But this does not mean a governor would act against the will of the people reflected in a bill passed by the legislature. Our Constitutional scheme mandates a collaborative effort between the executive and the legislature. The governor cannot take a combative position to have confrontation with the council of ministers or the legislature to subvert governance. ""Senior advocate Sibal said governors cannot be permitted to withhold assent indefinitely to negate the will of the people and his actions in this regard would always be subject to judicial review. ""Any absolute power conferred on a governor would create a constitutional conundrum. The concept of withholding assent is always temporary.""Sibal will continue his submissions Wednesday.The President sent a Reference to SC seeking its opinion on 14 questions, mainly on SC's power to grant deemed assent and fix timelines for President and governors, after a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan on Apr 8 granted deemed assent to 10 bills pending with the TN governor and fixed timelines for the constitutional heads of executive at the Centre and states for taking decision on bills passed by the legislature.",West bengal says constitution conferred some amount of discretionary powers on governors.

""This court referred the offence under Section 138 NI Act as a Civil Sheep in Criminal Wolf's Clothing which meant issues agitated by the parties under the said provision are of private nature which are brought within the sweep of criminality jurisdiction in order to strengthen the credibility of the negotiable instruments,"" the bench said while referring to an earlier verdict of the SC.The court set aside a Punjab and Haryana HC ruling that had refused to quash conviction in a cheque dishonour case after settlement between the parties.SC said when parties enter into an agreement and compound the offence, they do so to save themselves from the process of litigation, allows them to do so.

PATIALA: AAP MLA Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra has allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.According to Punjab Police sources, Pathanmajra and his accomplices fired at police officers during the escape and even ran over one personnel, leaving him injured.According to reports, Pathanmajra and his accomplices ran over police personnel with an SUV.The Sanour MLA was arrested a day after publicly criticising his party’s Delhi leadership.His detention in Patiala was linked to a rape case filed against him, sparking political uproar in the region.In a social media post, Pathanmajra claimed the case related to his former wife and alleged that the fresh charges of rape were politically motivated.“I was booked because I raised my voice against my own government, especially the Delhi leadership,” he wrote.His brother, Hardev Singh, said the MLA was taken into custody under Section 376 of the IPC despite already having been granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. “He was arrested from Dabri in Haryana in a case where bail was already granted. This is clearly an attempt to silence him,” he alleged.CIA Patiala confirmed that three weapons have been recovered and one accomplice of MLA Pathanmajra has been arrested.The arrested individual has been identified as Balwinder Singh, while the search for MLA Pathanmajra continues.Police said two officers were injured when stones were thrown at them during the MLA’s escape attempt.Authorities added that supporters of the MLA not only pelted stones but also opened fire at the police team.Before his arrest, Pathanmajra had appealed to colleagues and supporters via Facebook to protest outside the Patiala SSP’s office at the Mini Secretariat. He urged people to reach “in tractors, trolleys, and cars” to demand his release. “I will not be silenced even if more cases are registered against me. Will AAP’s Delhi leadership rule Punjabis now? Even Congress and BJP did not interfere to this extent,” he said.The MLA has repeatedly accused the party’s central leadership of sidelining Punjab leaders and “remote-controlling” the state. Recently, he criticised officials of the Irrigation Department over flood relief efforts in his constituency. Soon after, his security cover was withdrawn and police officers in the area were reshuffled — moves that raised eyebrows.“This is retaliation. They looted Punjab more than Abdali. Now they want to sell Punjab,” Pathanmajra declared.","Harmeet singh pathanmajra allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.

Maratha Quota Activist Manoj Jarange Patil Breaks Fast After Accepting Maharashtra Govt Resolution

Why Jarange claimed victory



Jarange breaks fast



Government issues GR



Court intervention and apology



NEW DELHI: Scenes of celebration were seen at Azad Maidan in Mumbai on Tuesday after Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange announced victory for the agitation. This came after the Maharashtra government’s cabinet sub-committee on Maratha quota, headed by minister Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, accepted most of his demands.Jarange made the announcement on the fifth day of his hunger strike, saying that the government had agreed to give Kunbi caste certificates to eligible Marathas. His supporters cheered the development, which also brought relief to Mumbai residents.Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis also hailed activist Manoj Jarange's move to call off his 5-day fast over the Maratha quota demand, saying the government found a solution in the interest of the Maratha community.""My objective was to give justice to the Maratha community. My government was always focused on the welfare of Marathas and I will continue to work for all communities in Maharashtra, be it Marathas or OBCs,"" the CM said.The Kunbi status will allow members of the Maratha community to seek benefits under the OBC quota, which has been Jarange’s main demand.""We will leave Mumbai by 9 pm (Tuesday) if the Maharashtra government issues GRs (government resolutions) on the Maratha quota demands,"" Jarange said.The sub-committee accepted his demand to implement the Hyderabad Gazetteer and assured that Marathas with Kunbi records will be given caste certificates after proper inquiry.Jarange told his supporters that the committee has agreed to issue a GR immediately and that the Satara Gazetteer will be implemented within a month.He added that the government has promised to withdraw cases against Maratha protesters by the end of September. The committee also said financial aid and jobs according to educational qualifications will be given within a week to families of those who died during the protests.According to Jarange, the committee informed him that Rs 15 crore has already been given to the families of deceased protesters, and the remaining compensation will be provided within a week.Later in the day, Jarange ended his fast after accepting the GR issued by the cabinet sub-committee. Vikhe Patil thanked him for agreeing to the proposal and breaking his fast.The Maharashtra government issued a resolution on the Hyderabad Gazetteer and announced the setting up of committees to enable Marathas to obtain Kunbi caste certificates if they can provide documentary proof showing they were recorded as Kunbis in the past.The GR said, ""In accordance with the historical references contained in the Hyderabad gazetteer, a dedicated scrutiny process shall be conducted to verify documents and establish eligibility of persons from the Maratha community for Kunbi caste certificates. The committee shall ensure that every claim is assessed in a time-bound and transparent manner.""Activist Manoj Jarange has been demanding that Marathas be recognised as Kunbis, an agrarian caste listed in the OBC category in Maharashtra. Such classification would make Marathas eligible for reservation in government jobs and education.Earlier on Tuesday, the Bombay high court ordered Jarange and his supporters to vacate Azad Maidan by 3 pm, noting that they did not have permission to protest there. The court later allowed him to stay until Wednesday morning.The court criticised the state government’s handling of the matter and warned it would take strict action to uphold the law. Following this, the cabinet sub-committee met Jarange at the protest site in the afternoon.This development came four days after Jarange and thousands of supporters reached Azad Maidan demanding a 10 per cent quota for Marathas under the OBC category.Jarange had said he was open to talks but would not leave Mumbai until his demands were met. He also said, ""Nobody can stop Maratha protesters from coming to Mumbai by this weekend.""However, after the high court’s directive to vacate the ground, his lawyer Satish Maneshinde apologised to the court on behalf of Jarange and his team for the behaviour of some protesters on city streets.As the deadline neared, Mumbai Police asked protesters to remove vehicles parked near Azad Maidan. Security personnel also cleared protesters from CSMT, where they had gathered for four days.According to officials, GRP and RPF personnel, along with 60 members of the Riot Control Force, were deployed at CSMT in south Mumbai.","Jarange made the announcement on the fifth day of his hunger strike.

J&K Police’s mountain rescue team also contributed to the report after studying the area along with a mountaineer who has summited Mt Everest.The dual cloudbursts had unleashed torrents of water, mud, boulders, and uprooted trees that swept into the small hamlet nestled in Chenab Valley — the last village en route Machail Mata temple — where hundreds of pilgrims had been camping. The surge hit around 11.40am, flattening everything in its war — houses, langars, three temples, vehicles, and even a bridge.A 2024-2025 govt study on GLOFs in Kishtwar is being discussed again. In the report, the district disaster management authority had warned that GLOF presents significant challenges to the community, infrastructure, and the environment in the region. It also stated that GLOFs present a major hazard to Padder, Machail, Dachhan, Marwah, and Warwan tehsils and areas near Kishtwar high altitude national park.These places are especially vulnerable due to their proximity to glacial lakes, making them prone to sudden flooding events that can have a devastating impact on the region. The report highlighted that Marwah and Warwan were more susceptible to danger and are designated “shadow areas” due to their remoteness, low-lying settlements and limited disaster preparedness and emergency response capacity. On Aug 26 this year, Warwan Valley was hit by a cloudburst, damaging around 190 houses and killing 45 cattle.GLOF events also pose a threat to Padder tehsil, which houses major power projects, the report stated. Infrastructure (roads, schools, hospitals, etc.) in Machail, Dachhan, and Marwah is also at considerable risk, the report said.","A preliminary investigation has found that two cloudbursts occurred approximately 13km from the remote village of chasoti in jammu and kashmir’s kishtwar district on aug 14, triggering flash floods that killed 65 people. “chasoti (tragedy) was not a glacial lake outburst flood event,” kishtwar deputy commissioner pankaj kumar sharma said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123664298,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-2014666,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

‘Insult To Every Mother’: PM Modi Tears Into Congress-RJD For Abusing His Late Mother

Poll Should political parties be held accountable for remarks made during rallies? Yes, they should be No, it's free speech

Video of clash went viral



NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday broke his silence with a sharp rebuttal over the Bihar rally row, after a viral video allegedly showed abusive remarks directed at his late mother. He called the remarks an insult not only to him but to “every mother, sister, and daughter of the country,” adding that the people of Bihar shared his anguish.Speaking at an event of the Bihar Rajya Jeevika Nidhi Saakh Sahkari Sangh Limited, PM Modi said, ""Mother is our world. Mother is our self-respect. I had not even imagined what happened a few days ago in this tradition-rich Bihar. My mother was abused from the stage of RJD-Congress in Bihar... These abuses are not just an insult to my mother. These are insults to the mothers, sisters and daughters of the country. I know.. . how bad all of you, every mother of Bihar, felt after seeing and hearing this! I know, as much pain as I have in my heart, the people of Bihar are also in the same pain.""PM Modi went on to say that his late mother had distanced him from herself so that he could dedicate his life to serving the nation.He said, ""My mother separated me from her so that I could serve crores of mothers like you. You all know that now my mother is not alive. Some time ago, after completing 100 years of age, she left us all. That mother of mine, who had nothing to do with politics, who is no more, was abused from the stage of the RJD, Congress. Sisters and mothers, I can see your faces; I can only imagine the pain you must have felt. I can see tears in the eyes of some mothers. This is very sad, painful.""Slamming the RJD-Congress over remarks targeting his mother, PM Narendra Modi said, ""'Yuvraaj,' born in a royal family with golden and silver spoons, cannot understand the pain of a poor mother.""His remarks came days after a video went viral on social media, purportedly showing unidentified men hurling abuses at PM Modi and his late mother from the stage of Rahul Gandhi’s ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ in Darbhanga, held along with RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar , a key ally of the BJP in the upcoming state assembly polls, also condemned the incident.In a post on X, he said, ""During the Voter Adhikar Yatra in Darbhanga, the use of highly inappropriate language against the Honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and his late mother from the platform of Congress and RJD is utterly deplorable, and I condemn it.""BJP and Congress workers clashed in Patna last week after the saffron party staged a protest over alleged abuses directed at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his mother during a rally in Darbhanga. A video shared by news agency ANI showed workers from both sides attacking each other with party flags.","Pm narendra modi breaks his silence over bihar rally row.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday rebuffed political parties' clamour for a directive to EC to accept Aadhaar card as standalone proof of citizenship to enable people to enroll in the Bihar voter list prepared after special intensive revision (SIR) and said the status of Aadhaar cannot be enhanced beyond what has been laid down in the law.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi, which had earlier said Aadhaar could be an identity document along with other documents specified by EC for enrolment in the voter list, said on Monday: ""Aadhaar will be one of the documents for verification"".When RJD counsel Prashant Bhushan said EC is not accepting Aadhaar as a standalone proof of identity for the 65 lakh names deleted from the draft voter list despite the court's orders, the bench said, ""We cannot enhance the status of Aadhaar beyond what is ascribed to it by the Aadhaar Act. We can also not go beyond what was said by a five-judge bench in Puttaswamy judgment while upholding Aadhaar"".Section 9 of the Aadhaar Act says: ""The Aadhaar number or the authentication thereof shall not, by itself, confer any right of, or be proof of, citizenship or domicile in respect of an Aadhaar number holder.""In the Sept 2018 Puttaswamy case judgment, a five-judge bench of SC had said, ""An Aadhaar number also does not, by itself, constitute a conferment of a right of citizenship, or domicile"".When counsels for other petitioners, including political parties, joined in the pitch to elevate Aadhaar from a biometric proof of identity to proof of one's citizenship for registration as a voter, the bench asked, ""Why is there so much of emphasis on Aadhaar? We will not pass an order that Aadhaar is the final proof of citizenship"".Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for EC, said, ""The repeated pleadings for Aadhaar is because there are certain districts in Bihar where Aadhaar saturation is 140%"", implying large-scale prevalence of bogus identity cards.The Centre repeatedly highlighted how illegal Bangladeshi migrants and Rohingyas have managed to fraudulently obtain Aadhaar cards in some states.The bench told the political parties to activate their grassroots-level workers and booth level agents to identify people who have been wrongly deleted from the draft voters list and help them file claims before the booth level officers of Election Commission to get their names included in the final voter list.","Bihar sir: sc slams political parties’ silence, directs poll panel to accept aadhaar or 11 documents.

Poll Which measure do you think is most important to prevent gold smuggling? Stricter airport/customs checks Stronger legal action and laws

NEW DELHI: Kannada actor Ranya Rao has been imposed with a fine of Rs 102 crore in the gold smuggling case, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) said. Along with her, three others were also imposed a fine of over Rs 50 crore. The DRI officials on Tuesday served the penalty notice running 2,500 pages to the actor and others presently in the Bengaluru Central Jail.She was caught with 14.8 kg of gold on March 3 at the Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru on her arrival from Dubai.Rao and others were served the notice inside the jail and they were also warned that if they don't pay the fine, their properties could be attached.The Ranya Rao case became a high-profile one as her stepfather is senior IPS officer Dr K Ramachandra Rao. He was sent on leave after the smuggling case surfaced. It was revoked later.Investigations revealed that Ranya Rao made frequent trips to Dubai (up to 52 between 2023 and early 2025) and allegedly used police escorts to avoid customs screenings. Gold jewellery worth Rs 2 crore and cash totalling Rs 2.67 crore were also recovered from her residence. Rao alleged severe maltreatment in DRI custody, claiming she was slapped multiple times (10–15 times), denied food and sleep, and coerced into signing voluminous documents, including blank pages.Following Rao's arrest, her husband Jatin Hukkeri came on the radar. Hukkeri sought legal relief by applying for exemption from arrest, citing that they had separated about a month after their marriage, around December 2024 -- highlighting that they were living apart at the time the case unfolded. The Karnataka High Court granted temporary protection, preventing any immediate action against him until the next hearing.","Dri imposes rs 102 cr penalty on kannada actress ranya rao in gold smuggling case.

BRS suspends K Kavitha: Why KCR removed daughter from party; family feud explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/brs-suspends-k-kavitha-why-kcr-removed-daughter-from-party-family-feud-explained/articleshow/123653161.cms,"K Kavitha has been expelled from the party by her father because of anti-party activities.

Who are Kavitha's cousins and what did she say?



Kavitha was removed from Telangana Boggu Gani Karmika Sangham in August



No Raksha-Bandhan between Kavitha KTR this year



Kavitha's six-page letter to KCR in May



Liquor scam and Kavitha's arrest



NEW DELHI: Former Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao suspended his daughter K Kavitha from the BRS days after she spoke up against her cousin and former minister Harish Rao for tarnishing her father's image. ""The party leadership is taking this matter seriously as the recent behaviour and ongoing anti-party activities of party MLC K Kavitha are damaging the BRS party. Party President K. Chandrasekhar Rao has taken a decision to suspend K Kavitha from the party with immediate effect,"" BRS posted on X.The immediate reason for the expulsion is Kavitha's recent statements against her cousins, T Harish Rao and Santosh Kumar. Kavitha said they have a tacit understanding with chief minister Revanth Reddy to defame her father as the Revanth Reddy government decided to order a CBI probe into the alleged irregularities in the Kaleshwaram project, which was built during the BRS regime.""We (BRS cadre) have to think why the taint of corruption came to KCR. Some who are close to KCR have benefited in many ways by making use of his name. KCR's name is getting defamed today because of their misdeeds.How can the party move ahead if the same persons are encouraged,"" Kavitha said.""Did Harish Rao, who was irrigation minister for five years, not have a major role in this? That's why KCR sidelined him (Harish Rao) in the second term (in power). Two, three persons are responsible for the taint on KCR in the whole episode of Kaleshwaram, While Harish Rao is one, former Rajya Sabha member (Santosh Kumar) is another,"" she said.But the rift goes a long way as Kavitha was being cornered in the party and her actions were held responsible for this.Weeks before, Kavitha was removed as honorary president of the Telangana Boggu Gani Karmika Sangham. Kavitha said it was a political conspiracy as the internal crisis was deepening.Kavitha has been openly speaking out against her party and raised questions over the handling of internal matters.According to reports, this was the first year that Kavitha skipped the Raksha Bandhan celebration. When she was asked before the occasion if she would tie a rakhi to KTR, her only brother, she said she would. But later, Kavitah disclosed that she was told that KTR was not in Bengaluru and not in Hyderabad.As Kavitha started the second innings of her political career, after taking a break as she got bail last year, she became vocal -- against her own party. In May, she wrote a six-page letter to father, and said KCR, of late, was lacking force. Kavitha criticised KCR's speech on the occasion of the party's silver jubilee and pointed out that the former chief minister omitted several key issues and his oratory was missing.Kavitha was arrested by the ED in March 2024 in the liquor scam case. Kavitha was part of the alleged South cartel in the scam, as the ED alleged that Kavitha conspired with Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia to influence the formulation and execution of the Delhi excise policy for 2021–22. In return, she is accused of arranging ₹100 crore in kickbacks for them.In August 2024, Kavitha was granted bail.Daughter of KCR, sister of KT Rama Rao, K Kavitha was born in Karimnagar and studied in Hyderabad. Kavitha studied B Tech. in Computer Science from VNRVJIET and an MS in Computer Science from the University of Southern Mississippi. After returning to India, she took her political plunge and was a key figure in the Telangana statehood movement alongside her father. Kavitha was elected the MP from Nizamabad in 2014, becoming the first woman MP of the TRS (now BRS). In 2019, she lost the election but was elected as an MLC from Nizamabad.","K kavitha has been expelled from the party by her father because of anti-party activities.

NEW DELHI: At an age when many women are busy caring for their grandchildren, a 55-year-old from Rajasthan’s Udaipur district has just welcomed her 17th child.The birth at the Community Health Centre in Jhadol block has turned Lilavas village into a talking point. Relatives, neighbours and villagers crowded the hospital to see Rekha, amused at the unusual sight of grandchildren greeting their new baby aunt, PTI reported.Rekha, married to scrap dealer Kavara Ram Kalbelia, has given birth 17 times over the years. Five of those children – four sons and one daughter – died soon after birth, leaving the couple with 12 surviving kids: seven boys and five girls.Their household spans three generations under one roof. ""Two of my sons and three of my daughters are married. Each of them has two or three children,"" Kavara said, his voice carrying both pride and weariness.This means while Rekha tends to her newborn, she is simultaneously grandmother to several toddlers.Behind the curiosity, however, lies hardship. Kavara makes a meagre living by selling scrap and admits to taking high-interest loans to pay for his children’s weddings. “No member of the family has ever gone to school,” he said, highlighting how poverty continues to dominate their lives.Doctors at the Jhadol centre described the delivery as a challenge. Rekha initially told them it was only her fourth pregnancy. Block CMHO Dr Dharmendra noted that the case reflects the difficulties in tribal-dominated areas, where lack of education and awareness often fuel such situations.“This is a nomadic family that keeps moving. Eleven surviving children were found with them. We will work to link them with government schemes and provide support,” he said.Gynaecologist Dr. Roshan Darangi, who handled the delivery, confirmed the truth later: “It turned out to be her 17th childbirth. Now, we will counsel her for sterilisation.”Another doctor, Mukesh Garasiya, added that Rekha had been admitted on August 24 without sonography or pre-delivery tests. “She could have died from excessive bleeding. With so many deliveries, the uterus weakens and the risk of haemorrhage rises. Thankfully, this time, everything went smoothly,” he explained.","Rekha ram kalbelia, 55, from rajasthan's udaipur district has just welcomed her 17th child.
