Mahadev app scam: CBI raids carried out 'to generate content for PM Modi's speech' says Bhupesh Baghel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mahadev-app-scam-cbi-raids-carried-out-to-generate-content-for-pm-modis-speech-says-bhupesh-baghel/articleshow/119567613.cms,"Photo/Agencies

NEW DELHI: Former Chhattisgarh chief minister and senior Congress leader Bhupesh Baghel said late on Wednesday that the CBI raids at his premises were politically motivated . He alleged that the action was meant to create material for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech during his visit to the state on March 30.Baghel claimed he had not received any prior notice about the searches at his official residence in Raipur and said that he was not responsible for ""whatever the CBI had planted there.""The CBI conducted searches at Baghel’s residences in Raipur and Bhilai on Wednesday in connection with the alleged Rs 6,000 crore Mahadev app scam . Officials said the houses of senior police officers and individuals associated with the former chief minister were also searched.Baghel said that the CBI took documents related to his assets and seized his mobile phones from his residence in Bhilai. Among those whose premises were searched were Congress MLA Devendra Yadav in Bhilai, former political advisor Vinod Verma, and IPS officers Anand Chhabra, Abhishek Pallava, Arif Shaikh, and Prashant Agrawal. State police service officer Sanjay Dhruv was also among those whose homes were raided, according to sources.After the search at his Bhilai residence, Baghel said, ""The raids were politically motivated. The action was carried out just to generate content for the PM's speech during his upcoming visit to the state on March 30. There was no other reason.""He also claimed that the CBI had a search warrant for his Bhilai residence but did not inform him about the raid at his official residence in Raipur.""I didn't receive any notice about raids in Raipur's official residence. I learnt about the raids after I came out of the house. Whatever they had planted there, I will not be responsible for it because neither I, nor my family members were there. This is their (CBI's) conspiracy,"" he said while talking to reporters.Baghel said the previous Congress government had acted against the Mahadev betting app.""During (previous) Congress government in the state, around 74 FIRs were lodged in connection with Mahadev betting app and more than 200 people were arrested and over 2000 bank accounts related to it were freezed.""We took action against the app, but they (government agencies) claim we protected the app and took money. How will the one who takes action accept the protection money? Protection money is taken where there is a double engine (government) and betting is still functional,"" he claimed.He further said that the Congress government had requested the Centre to issue a lookout notice against the app’s promoters, Saurabh Chandrakar and Ravi Uppal, and to arrest them abroad.""But (religious guru) Pradeep Mishra, who praises the BJP, visited Dubai by becoming a guest of Saurabh Chandrakar and Ravi Uppal.""If CBI officials have courage, they should ask Pardeep Mishra whose programme is currently underway in the home district of Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai in Jashpur about his relations with Saurabh Chandrakar and Pradeep Mishra,"" Baghel said.He also claimed that while the promoters of the app had been seen in photos with BJP leaders, no action was being taken against them, whereas Congress leaders were being investigated.Baghel mentioned that he was supposed to attend a drafting committee meeting in Delhi for the AICC session in Ahmedabad but was unable to go due to the raids.""The CBI entered my house at around 7.30 am and left at 9.15 pm despite the search ending at around 4.15 pm. Fifteen days ago, the ED had raided my house. What they (CBI) will get by raiding?"" he asked.He said the ED had taken photocopies of his property-related documents, while the CBI took away the original papers.""I told the CBI to leave photocopies because IT and EOW will follow them. Otherwise what they will recover in the name of action?"" he said.Baghel also said that although the ED’s raid was linked to an alleged liquor scam and the CBI’s action was related to the Mahadev app, both agencies were investigating his assets.""The previous Raman Singh-head BJP government had got my assets probed. The state's EOW did the same. I invite all agencies to come together and do an investigation at once. The actions are aimed at defaming and harassing me,"" he said.He alleged that the BJP was frustrated after he was made Congress in-charge of Punjab and was recently cleared by the court in a seven-year-old (sleaze) CD case.Meanwhile, Chhattisgarh deputy chief minister Arun Sao said the Congress should not connect the CBI searches to politics and should cooperate with the investigation.Last year, the state government handed over 70 cases related to the Mahadev scam to the CBI, including one registered with the Economic Offences Wing (EOW).The Enforcement Directorate, which is also probing the case, has alleged that its probe revealed the involvement of several top politicians and bureaucrats from Chhattisgarh.The app was an umbrella syndicate arranging online platforms for illegal betting websites to enrol new users, create user IDs and launder money through a layered web of 'benami' bank accounts, it claimed.",Former chhattisgarh chief minister bhupesh baghel said the cbi raids at his premises were politically motivated.

'Unfortunate... law should take action': Adityanath on Kunal Kamra row



Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath , in an exclusive interview with news agency ANI, addressed critical issues spanning politics, governance, and religious matters while taking strong positions on several topics.The interview covered significant ground, from allegations of foreign interference in the upcoming 2024 Lok Sabha elections to the state's contentious bulldozer policy.The chief minister also expressed his stance on the ongoing row over remarks made by comedian Kunal Kamra during his show in Mumbai.The Uttar Pradesh chief minister affirmed that people from all religions are safe in the state, emphasising that communal harmony is maintained when Hindus feel secure. He said, ""If Hindus are safe, then Muslims are also safe. In Uttar Pradesh, Muslims are the safest. Before 2017, riots would see both Hindu and Muslim properties burning. After 2017, riots stopped.""""A Muslim family is the safest among a hundred Hindu families. But can 50 Hindus be safe among 100 Muslim families? No. Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan are examples,"" Yogi said.Speaking about Sanatan Dharma , he called it the world's oldest religion and said, ""Sanatan Dharma followers have never sought to convert others or establish dominion over them. We see the world as a family.""""A Muslim family is the safest among a hundred Hindu families. They will have the freedom to practice all their religious deeds. But can 50 Hindus be safe among 100 Muslim families? No. Bangladesh is an example. Before this, Pakistan was an example. What happened in Afghanistan? If there is smoke or someone is being hit, we should be careful before we get hit. That is what needs to be taken care of,"" Yogi said, while adding that he treats everyone equally.Yogi accused the opposition of using foreign funds to influence the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, with the Congress and INDIA bloc being directly involved. He accused NGOs, social media platforms, and digital media of being used to spread false propaganda against the BJP.He pointed to billionaire investor George Soros as one of the figures allegedly involved in financing these efforts and warned that further revelations would expose more details.""Congress and opposition parties did propaganda and they had not only spread propaganda, but foreign money was also involved in it. George Soros had already announced it... Many facts will come to light. Through NGOs, social media platforms, digital media, they spread propaganda on a large-scale propaganda in various parts of the country that BJP will change the constitution, if PM Modi will come, they will bring a new constitution, all kinds of things they have said,"" CM Yogi Adityanath told ANI.""I am saying that foreign money was involved in the Lok Sabha elections throughout the country in which Congress and other parties of the INDIA bloc were directly involved in it and through that, they tried to influence the elections. This action falls under the category of treason. You are taking money from a foreign power and influencing the country's elections,"" he added.Yogi Adityanath strongly defended ' Maha kumbh ' amid opposition criticism, particularly from West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee , who labelled it ""Mrityu Kumbh"" following a stampede incident that claimed lives of .....""Every day from Bengal, from January 13 to February 26, 50,000 to 100,000 devotees used to come to Prayagraj. The West Bengal Government got scared to see the crowd as their railway stations and airports were filled with people heading to Prayagraj... Whether it is the West Bengal Government, the Congress, the RJD, or the Samajwadi Party, whatever they have said about the Mahakumbh is an example of their appeasement. It is an example of insulting the faith of India. But the Mahakumbh has proved that it was a Mrityunjay Mahakumbh,"" the UP CM stated.He further mocked Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra, branding it as ""Bharat Todo Abhiyan"", and accused him of tarnishing India’s image on foreign soil.""Rahul jaise kuch namune rehne chahiye jisse ek rasta hamesha ke liye saaf hota rahe aur acha rahe"", Adityanath said, suggesting that Gandhi’s political presence ultimately benefits the BJP.Responding to criticism over his government's ""bulldozer action,"" Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath defended the policy, stating that those who take the law into their own hands will face consequences within the legal framework.""Those who believe in justice, justice is done for them. Those who take justice and law into their own hands, they are taught a lesson within the framework of law. It should be explained in the language they understand,"" Adityanath said.Justifying strong action against criminals, he said that if someone resorts to violence, the government must respond accordingly. ""If someone comes as a violent person to attack us, should we stand in front of him? No, if he comes as a violent person, we will have to respond to his violence there,"" he added.Yogi Adityanath vowed to revive as many temples as present in Sambhal. He said that the authorities have till now identified more than 54 pilgrimage sites in the city, and efforts are underway to locate the remaining ones.""Jitne bhi honge, sab dhundenge. Jo Bhagwan ne aankh di hai, wo dekhe ki Sambhal mein kya hua. Sambhal satya hai,"" he declared. He also questioned the legitimacy of mosques built on ruins of vandalised Hindu temples arguing that Islam itself does not recognise places of worship constructed by destroying others.Regarding the Mathura mosque dispute, Adityanath maintained that the state government is abiding by the court’s directives but hinted at potential action, saying, ""Who knows what could have happened by now?""In relation to Kunal Kamra's recent remark on Eknath Shinde, Yogi Adityanath said that the freedom of expression does not mean that individuals can use it to attack someone else, adding that law should take action against such people ""who are creating differences in the country.""""Freedom of expression is in the realm of law. It should be in the realm of constitutional values. And in that realm, there is freedom of expression. The freedom of your personality cannot be used to attack someone else. It is unfortunate that some people have considered the freedom of this individual as their birthright to divide the country and increase the division. And I feel that the law should take action against such people who are creating a difference in the country,"" CM Yogi said.","Uttar pradesh chief minister yogi adityanath addressed critical issues spanning politics, governance, and religious matters in an exclusive interview with news agency ani.

Waqf divide in Bihar NDA? Catch-22 situation for BJP and allies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/waqf-divide-in-bihar-nda-catch-22-situation-for-bjps-allies/articleshow/119547674.cms,"Nagpuriya

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: It's a catch-22 situation for the BJP allies in poll-bound Bihar. The anti-Waqf Amendment Bill protest in Patna on Wednesday set the stage for a fierce political showdown in the state as elections approach. While the RJD and other opposition parties have come out strongly against the proposed Bill claiming that it targets the minorities, the BJP has backed the amendments, saying it will benefit the poor sections of the Muslim community.The All India Muslim Personal Law Board ( AIMPLB ), which is leading the nationwide protests, has alleged that the NDA government at the Centre is trying to seize Waqf properties that were dedicated by their forefathers for the welfare of the people. They claimed that the government is unlawfully attempting to take control of these properties.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav , who is leading the opposition's charge against the ruling NDA in Bihar, joined the AIMPLB protest, accompanied by his father Lalu Prasad. At the protest, Tejashwi asserted that his party would use its full might to oppose the Bill that was ""unconstitutional"", ""dictatorial"" and inspired by the ideology of the RSS (""""). The Congress, the Left parties and the latest entrant in Bihar politics - Prashant Kishor all have opposed the Waqf Bill.However, it is the BJP-led NDA that faces a dilemma on the Waqf issue - which has the potential to polarise the voters of the state. While the BJP is firm in its backing of the amendments, its allies are guarded in their response.Chief minister Nitish Kumar 's JD(U), Union ministers Chirag Paswan's LJP have always found support of minorities in the state in their pockets of influence. These leaders, who are known to hold grand Iftar parties over the years, have already faced the heat over the issue in the form of boycotts from some outfits this year. It will be interesting to see how they position themselves vis-à-vis the Bill amid the opposition's attacks.At today's protest, Tejashwi called Nitish power-hungry. ""There are some who are supporting the Bill because of their greed for power. I am proud that I have in my veins the blood of Lalu ji, who has come here despite his body having been worn down by a kidney transplant and heart surgeries,"" Tejashwi said at the protest site.Interestingly, an ailing Lalu was brought to the protest site perhaps to remind the minorities about the incident when the RJD supremo had famously stopped the Ayodhya Rath Yatra on its tracks by getting BJP patriarch L K Advani arrested in Bihar.The RJD has already dropped enough hints that it will go all out to corner the JD(U) on the issue of Waqf Bill. Last week, the party had put up a poster targeting Nitish Kumar over his stance on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).The poster, which was displayed outside the residence of former CM and RJD leader Rabri Devi at 10 Circular Road, Patna, depicted CM Nitish greeting a Muslim cleric. The message on the poster read, "","" accusing Nitish of being a ""cheater"" who forgets his promises. The poster, placed by RJD leader Sanju Kohli, also contained a scathing message: ""I will take your vote but not stand with you on NRC and Waqf Bill with you.""While the JD(U) and Nitish Kumar are yet to clear their stand on the issue, the party has countered RJD's poster attack by releasing a new poster titled 'Bhoolega Nahi Bihar,' (Bihar will not forget). The poster highlights the ""atrocities of the jungle raj"" and carries the message 'Bhoolega Nahi Bihar.'LJP chief Chirag Paswan, who has objected to announcements of boycotts of his Iftaar parties, has blamed the Congress and RJD for the plight of Muslims, claiming that the community was treated as a ""vote bank"" by these parties.Recalling the much talked about political move of his father late Ram Vilas Paswan in 2005, the LJP(RV) president said, ""I shall continue to follow in the footsteps of my father, who had put his own political career at stake by promising his party's support to whoever made a Muslim the chief minister of Bihar"".However, another key NDA ally - Jitan Ram Manjhi targeted the Waqf protesters and used objectionable words for them.The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, aims to introduce reforms such as digitization, enhanced audits, improved transparency, and legal mechanisms to reclaim illegally occupied properties. The proposed amendment seeks to ensure that Waqf properties are utilized for their intended purposes, benefiting both the Muslim community and the country as a whole.As the election in the state approaches, the attacks and counterattacks over the issue will get more sharp and shrill. The RJD and the Congress will try to maximise their political gains by raising the pitch and putting the NDA allies on the defensive. Any polarisation over the issue may end up helping them and also perhaps the BJP, which has already made massive gains in the state.",The anti-waqf amendment bill protest in patna on wednesday set the stage for a fierce political showdown in the state as elections approach.

Punjab Police’s stand

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army has called for a transparent and time-bound investigation into the alleged assault of Colonel Pushpinder Singh Bath by Punjab Police personnel in Patiala.Stressing the need for accountability, senior Army officials said those responsible should face strict legal action to maintain trust between the military and civil administration, according to the news agency PTI.Following the incident, Colonel Bath has moved the Punjab and Haryana High Court, requesting that the case be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or another independent agency.He argued that an impartial probe under the Punjab Police was unlikely.The Army has vowed to pursue the case until justice is served. “A fair and honest investigation must be conducted in a transparent and time-bound manner to ensure the guilty are punished,” said Lt Gen Mohit Wadhwa , Chief of Staff, Army Western Command.Punjab director general of police (DGP) Gaurav Yadav reaffirmed the force’s respect for the Army, assuring that those responsible would be held accountable. “Anyone found guilty of assaulting a serving Army officer will face strict legal action,” he said.To ensure a thorough probe, Punjab Police has suspended 12 personnel and set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT), led by a senior officer. The SIT has been instructed to expedite its investigation, according to ANI.According to Col. Bath’s complaint, he and his son were attacked by Punjab Police officers outside a dhaba in Patiala on the night of March 13-14. The Army was informed the next day, and Col. Bath was transferred from a civil hospital to the Command Hospital in Chandimandir for further treatment.On March 22, the Civil Lines police station in Patiala registered an FIR against the officers named in the complaint.

What Supreme Court said:



The top court said: ""In normal circumstances, we are slow in granting stay at this stage. But since the observations in paragraphs 21, 24 and 26 are totally unknown to canons of law and depict total insensitive and inhuman approach, we are inclined to stay the said observations.""

Referring to the high court's observations, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, ""This is one judgement I take a very serious exception.""

""It is a very serious matter,"" Justice Gavai said, ""exhibiting total insensitiveness on the part of the judge.""

""We are sorry to use such harsh words against the judge,"" the bench added.

""We have perused the order (of the high court). We are at pains to say that some of the observations made in the impugned order and particularly in paragraphs 21, 24 and 26 depicts a total lack of sensitivity on the part of the author of the judgement,"" the bench added.

""The registrar general is forthwith communate the order and place before honourable chief justice of Allahabad HC and take such matter as deemed appropriate,"" it added, according to news agency PTI.

The Allahabad HC's ruling



Family relieved after Supreme Court order

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed the Allahabad high court 's controversial order, which stated that ""grabbing the breast and breaking the pyjama string"" were not sufficient grounds to charge an accused with rape or attempted rape.During the hearing, a bench comprising Justices BR Gavai and AG Masih criticised the high court judge for displaying ""total insensitivity"" in handling the case.The apex court remarked that while it regretted using harsh words for the judge, the matter was serious, and the order was not issued impulsively.A few days ago, the high court passed an order in connection with a case involving two men, Pawan and Akash, who allegedly grabbed the minor’s breasts, tore her pyjama string, and attempted to drag her under a culvert while she was walking with her mother.Initially, they were charged under Section 376 of the IPC (rape) and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. However, the Allahabad HC ruled that their actions did not qualify as rape or an attempt to rape but instead fell under the lesser charge of aggravated sexual assault , punishable under Section 354(B) IPC and Section 9(m) of the POCSO Act.The high court’s ruling was based on the argument that ""an attempt to commit rape must go beyond the stage of preparation and actual attempt to commit an offence consists chiefly in the greater degree of determination.""""The specific allegation against Akash is that he tried to drag the victim beneath the culvert and broke the string of her pyjama. It is also not stated by witnesses that due to this act of the accused the victim got naked or got undressed. There is no allegation that accused tried to commit penetrative sexual assault against the victim,"" the court observed in its order.In view of this, the court opined that the allegations levelled against the accused and facts of the case hardly constituted an offence of attempt to rape in the case. Victim's family relieved after SC order.The family of the minor girl, who was the victim of an attempted rape in Kasganj district, has expressed relief after the Supreme Court stayed the high court's ruling in the case.Advocate Rachna Tyagi, who represented the family in the apex court, shared the update, stating that the survivor's mother is ""extremely relieved."" Meanwhile, the government advocate representing the survivor in the Allahabad High Court was unavailable for comment.Speaking to PTI, Tyagi said, ""The survivor's mother is extremely relieved because ever since the incident in November 2021, her FIR was not being registered. In January 2022, she had to approach the district court under Section 156(3) to file a complaint.""""Since then, for over three-and-a-half years, neither the trial court nor the high court ordered the FIR to be registered. Attempted rape is a cognisable offence and an FIR must be filed in such cases,"" she added.","The supreme court on wednesday stayed the allahabad high court's controversial order, which stated that ""grabbing the breast and breaking the pyjama string"" were not sufficient grounds to charge an accused with rape or attempted rape.

The two exercises will be conducted simultaneously — the census in three phases over a three-and-a-half-year period and the increasing of green cover over four years.The census will help track tree populations area-wise and check illegal felling. The court took this step in view of the fact that Delhi witnesses felling of five trees per hour on an average. A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan allowed FRI to go ahead with the exercises but asked it to try to complete the tasks in a shorter span and also reduce budget.The court also accepted the submission of additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati that the money to undertake census should be released from the CAMPA fund. She assured that all necessary help would be provided to the institute but said the exercise should be concluded in a shorter time.As per FRI, the exercise will be carried out in three phases, with the first phase aiming at standardising the methodology for tree census — it will take 15 months. The second phase is about development of an action plan that will be done in three months, and the final phase is implementation, which will take two years.“FRI proposes an estimated budget of Rs 443 lakh for the execution of phase one and phase two on standardisation of methodology and pilot trial for the development of action plan for implementation in phase three,” the institute said in its affidavit.It said the Tree Authority and the Delhi forest department will undertake the census, and FRI will provide technical support and capacity building to the department’s officials in undertaking the exercise besides monitoring and evaluation. The final report will be submitted to the court by the authority.It said the institute will design and develop a web portal and a mobile app for the census. Regarding enhancing green cover in the national capital territory (NCT), FRI placed before the court a four-year action plan to form a base to launch a massive afforestation drive to increase the forest and tree cover of the area falling within the limits of the govt of the NCT of Delhi.National Forest Policy mandates that one-third of total land area of country should be under forest or tree cover.",The census will help track tree populations area-wise and check illegal felling.

Rahul was present in Lok Sabha on Wednesday after being absent for a few days.Birla probably had this incident in mind while rebuking Rahul. “In this House, father and daughter, mother and daughter, husband and wife have been members. In this context, I expect the leader of opposition to conduct himself in accordance with Rule 349 that deals with rules to be observed by members in the House,” the speaker said, adding that MPs should conduct themselves in a manner that upheld the high standards and dignity of the House.Rahul was present in the House and wanted to speak on some issue but Birla adjourned proceedings for the lunch break after making his point.

He did not allow me to speak a word. He was speaking about me, and I don’t know what he said about me, all unsubstantiated.

‘Political nonsense’: SC bins PIL on ‘honeytrap’ claims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/political-nonsense-sc-bins-pil-on-honeytrap-claims/articleshow/119565753.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court dismissed Wednesday a PIL seeking probe into alleged honeytrap operations in Karnataka, calling it “political nonsense”. A three-judge bench rejected the petition filed by activist Binay Singh, a Jharkhand resident. Singh had sought a court-monitored investigation or a probe led by a retired SC judge. The top court questioned the relevance of the plea, asking: “You are a resident of Jharkhand. Why are you bothered about what’s happening in that state? They are competent enough to take care of this.” The petitioner’s counsel, Barun Kumar Sinha, argued that the allegations were serious and posed a threat to judicial independence . “We are concerned about the independence of the judiciary,” the counsel said. Sinha argued that media reports on the matter merited a thorough probe. But SC was unconvinced. “Why should they fall into a honeytrap? If someone sets up a honeytrap and you fall into it, you are inviting trouble for yourself,” it observed, adding that the judiciary had concerns more pressing than political disputes. Cooperation minister KN Rajanna had claimed on March 20 that there had been attempts to “honeytrap” him and that at least 48 politicians across parties had fallen prey to similar schemes. “People say that there is a CD (compact disc) and pen drive factory in Karnataka. I have learnt that there are CDs and pen drives of 48 people. This network is spread across India and several Union ministers too were trapped,” Rajanna had said.","A three-judge bench rejected the petition filed by activist binay singh, a jharkhand resident.

He was hospitalised a year after with severe abdominal pain, and a month thereafter he passed away.LIC rejected the claim filed by the policyholder's widow on the grounds that the deceased had withheld information about his chronic alcoholism.Referring to Clause 7(xi) of the Jeevan Arogya Plan, LIC said the policy excludes coverage for ""self-inflicted injuries or conditions (attempted suicide) and/or the use or misuse of any drugs or alcohol and complications arising from it"".The deceased's wife had moved the consumer forum, which directed LIC to reimburse the medical expenses. However, SC disagreed with the order of National Consumer Disputes Resolution Commission.The court said that the deceased's ""alcoholism was a long- standing condition, which he knowingly suppressed while subscribing to the policy"". ""Given this suppression of material facts, the appellant was justified in repudiating the claim under the exclusion clause,"" it said.","A bench of justices vikram nath and sandeep mehta upheld the life insurance corporation's decision to deny a claim.
