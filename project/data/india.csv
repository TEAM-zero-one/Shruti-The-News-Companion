NEW DELHI: The nationwide strike called by trade unions on Wednesday had little impact on attendance across sectors with the banking sector seeing the highest level of absenteeism at around 33%.Estimates from 20 major cities across the country that are available with the Centre showed that sectors such as railways, once controlled by unions, had no impact, as was also the case with air transport, including airport, and power.There were of course pockets - such as Kolkata, Asansol and Chennai - where there was an impact on banks and insurance companies.After banks, coal and mines and oil and gas with around 19% absenteeism in both came next, followed by insurance (16%). But it was not significant to affect operations. In any case, with the use of electronic clearing and fund transfer and ATMs, bank strikes are no longer as disruptive for citizens as they were in the past.The numbers in most cities indicate that the unions have lost their appeal among workers. More than 200 unions from industries as diverse as defence and oil and gas to several banks and ports decided against participating in the nationwide strike.The strike was called against the four labour codes enacted by the Centre, which have not yet been implemented as states are still in dialogue.What has hurt the unions attempts to mobilise workers is states moving ahead and amending their labour laws to provide significant relaxations across multiple provisions - from allowing women to work in night shifts to raising the retrenchment threshold without govt approval from 100 to 300 workers.Besides, only a handful of states have not responded on the labour codes, and that too for political reasons, as most of them chase investments, where companies often seek flexibility and lower inspector raj.",The banking sector saw the highest level of absenteeism at around 33%.

NEW DELHI: The air in Sannoth, a village next to Bawana industrial area in north Delhi, stings before it suffocates. By the time you walk past a large landfill, which has grown over the past 12 years, cross a stinking sewer that once used to be a clean natural drain towards Munak Canal, your throat itches and your eyes burn. Locals say this is the new normal.Sannoth, once known for health-conscious people and yoga practitioners, now lives with asthma inhalers, skin diseases and dyspnea.The region already has three plants to manage Delhi’s piling solid waste, chunks of which are often set afire, sending smoke into homes. However, villages are now bracing for a new waste-to-energy (WTE) plant recently cleared by the Union environment ministry.he villagers have been protesting against the newly sanctioned M/s Jindal Urban Waste Management (Bawana) Limited since Dec last year. Their concern is existential. “How can they bring another WTE plant when three such waste management facilities are already killing us slowly? We are seeing our loved ones dying, children cough and often struggle to breathe while playing,” Rajpal Saini, 70, a Sannoth resident.People can’t do yoga anymore, can’t sit outside, can’t go for long walks. The monsoon, a season that once would refill the ponds and channels and increase greenery, has become a nightmare as an intense foul odour fills the air,” said Saini, who retired from MCD’s sanitation department and has since dedicated his life to probing and exposing the environmental impact of waste processing in the area.The new plant is to come up between between the Munak Canal, which feeds half of the city with drinking water, and the landfill — a private storage and treatment facility of hazardous waste.A visit byto the area paints a grim picture of environmental degradation and a community grappling with a worsening health crisis. Yet, the plant’s environmental impact assessment (EIA) appears to side-step or downplay these realities — especially the proximity of dense human settlements and the precarious state of the natural stream slicing through the project site.sent queries to the Jindal group to find out how were they going to address the environmental concerns. However, no reply was received despite repeated attempts.Despite sustained local protests, the project secured environmental clearance. However, as the MoEFCC gave environmental clearance to the project on June 18, fears of a spike in contamination echo louder, given the condition of a similar facility in Okhla.“Our elders who died about a decade back were the last ones to die a natural death. Ever since that landfill started to grow taller, garbage being brought to this area in trucks, and a waste-to-energy plant was established, we witnessed diseases engulfing this and neighbouring villages. Swarms of big colourful flies, foul smell and itchy eyes are common. Now that a new WTE plant, a large one, has been proposed, we have no other option but to protest,” said Saini.Munesh, another resident of Sanoth, pointed towards her son, 23-yearold Ayush, who has an intellectual disability, and said that for the past five years he faced difficulty breathing, and the situation worsened every year. “Ever since the issue started, the seizures increased,” said Munesh.Similar concerns were echoed by Parvinder, father of 12-year-old Akshita, who often gets restless and gasps for air.“Some 12 years back, next to a natural pond, they started bringing and dumping waste to set up a private plant. Soon, a natural drain that passed through that site started getting murkier dark water. The air quality of the village worsened. We remember that while playing cricket as children, people would take sips from this channel. Now, we worry for the Munak Canal, which passes right next to the proposed site,” said Chand Narwal, who was joined by a retired Delhi Police constable Balraj, who echoed the same concerns.“My wife died three years back due to lung disease, and I got asthma,” said Brahm Prakash, a villager who retired from DTC.Saini further pointed out that the proposed project site had over 80 trees which villagers numbered, and that the project might impact a population larger than expected. “The EC was granted without proper fieldwork and the impact to human life due to already existing plants was avoided. No one ever visited the villages. They didn’t even consider public views which were sought by the Delhi govt. We even found that about 30 responses in favour of the plant were from JJ cluster, who were not even aware of the plant,” said Saini.When TOI contacted some of the 30 JJ colony residents who signed a handwritten letter in favour of the plant, they claimed that they were misguided. “Two men came to the colony and told that a water plant is being set up and that I will get a job there. So, I signed the letter supporting that factory. Later, we came to know that it’s a plant to burn garbage,” said Tufail Khan, a resident of JJ colony. Md Sahid Alam, another resident, tells a similar story.“The so-called public hearing was a complete farce, a disorganised, harassing charade that shifted venues multiple times, silenced residents, failed to record any objections or minutes, and rushed through before locals could even file their written submissions. To top it off, multiple letters favouring the plant, all in identical handwriting, expose a blatantly duplicitous attempt to manipulate public sentiment. Above that, toxic emissions and ash from the already existing plant and landfill have already led to skyrocketing rates of respiratory, kidney and cancerrelated illnesses among villagers, so approving another incinerator here is nothing short of environmental and health betrayal,” said environmental activist Bhavreen Kandhari.","Villagers say a waste landfill, which has been growing for 12 years, is a major source of pollution.

NEW DELHI: An expert committee, appointed by central biotech regulator to review biosafety data of transgenic cotton, has submitted a favourable report on genetically modified HTBt cotton, paving way for Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) to take a final call on its commercial cultivation.Though transgenic Bt cotton is being cultivated in the country after getting approved in 2002, the herbicide-tolerant Bt (HTBt) cotton could not get the mandatory GEAC nod despite long-pending demand of cotton farmers. As a result, its illegal variant is reportedly being used without quality check in many cotton-producing states.Sources said the expert committee's report has given an all clear to HTBt cotton but the final decision would be taken by govt after getting regulator GEAC's nod.The demand for legal use of HTBt is expected to be raised again on Friday when Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan visits Coimbatore for a crop-specific meeting on cotton.Since the ministry has invited suggestions from farmers ahead of the meeting amid reports of declining Bt cotton productivity in the country due to a newly emerging disease, tobacco streak virus (TSV), demand for allowing another transgenic variety - HTBt - for commercial cultivation at the earliest is expected to be the key takeaway.","An expert committee, appointed by central biotech regulator to review biosafety data of transgenic cotton, has submitted a favourable report on genetically modified htbt cotton.

"Ahead of civic polls, Telangana cabinet clears 42% quota",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ahead-of-civic-polls-telangana-cabinet-clears-42-quota/articleshow/122377126.cms,"HYDERABAD: A cabinet meeting of the A Revanth Reddy-led Congress govt in Telangana approved Thursday a proposal to grant 42% reservation to Backward Classes (BCs) in local bodies - just in time for panchayat elections within three months, as mandated by a June 25 high court directive. The quota will be implemented through an ordinance.The reservation percentage is based on empirical data from the caste survey conducted by the state govt and submitted to the BC Commission headed by Busani Venkateshwara Rao. Based on Supreme Court's verdict permitting sub-classification of groups entitled to reservation, the cabinet had approved amendments to the Panchayat Raj Act, 2018, as precursor to raising the quota for Backwards Classes.With governor Jishnu Dev Varma proroguing the assembly and legislative council sessions on Thursday, the state govt now has the constitutional window to issue the relevant ordinance.The cabinet made the decision after consulting legal experts and the advocate general, who was present at the meeting, sources said. Revenue minister Ponguleti Srinivas Reddy & BC welfare minister Ponnam Prabhakar said an ordinance was key to avoid delays & legal complications.""Per Rahul Gandhi's promise, Congress conducted a caste survey after coming to power. Two bills providing 42% reservation for BCs in education, employment, and local bodies were passed in the assembly and sent to the governor. But the Centre has been raising queries, stalling constitutional amendments needed for quota implementation. This ordinance reflects our firm commitment to BC political upliftment,"" Srinivas Reddy said.Ponnam said panchayat elections would be held by Sept 30, the deadline set by HC. ""We stand by our BC declaration made in Kamareddy. We urge all parties to support this reservation for the smooth conduct of panchayat elections,"" he said.On concerns over SC's 50% cap on total reservations, Ponnam argued that it had already been breached through the Centre's EWS quota, while Tamil Nadu currently has over 60% reservation. He said BCs constitute 56% of Telangana's population, which justifies 42% reservation for them.","The quota will be implemented through an ordinance.

NEW DELHI: The govt's aim is to raise gross enrolment ratio (GER) in higher education to 50% by 2035 and universities and colleges must adopt a students-first approach as students are the core of national strength, education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said while inaugurating two-day vice-chancellors' conference of central universities in Gujarat's Kevadia on Thursday.The conference will review five years of the implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and chalk out a strategy for aligning higher education institutions with the vision of 'Viksit Bharat 2047'. Organised by the education ministry in collaboration with the Central University of Gujarat, the meeting brought together over 50 vice-chancellors to assess institutional progress and discuss reforms for the next phase.Pradhan said the 'panch sankalpa (five resolutions)' of the NEP-2020 would serve as the guiding framework for universities in creating an inclusive, and globally competitive higher education ecosystem.

NEW DELHI: No construction will be allowed along 15m on either side of greenfield and access-controlled bypasses and ring roads to be built by Union govt across states, as part of a policy the road transport ministry is in the process of finalising. State govts will have to notify these as 'No Construction Green Zone' under their planning laws, prohibiting any development activity.This will be the major thrust of the ministry's ""access-controlled ring roads/bypass"" policy for decongesting major cities to ensure such stretches don't face congestion due to ribbon development. Ribbon development refers to linear development along roads, with buildings coming up with direct access to transportation networks.In response to a question on how the ministry is addressing the problem of unregulated ribbon development along ring roads and bypasses at a recent meeting of PPPAC, an inter-ministerial panel for appraisal of projects built in public private partnership mode, it said, ""Under the proposed policy, emphasis is on regulated development along proposed bypasses. The policy will require a development control zone of 15m on either side of the NH bypass or ring road being notified by the state govt as a green zone under the planning laws enacted by the state, where development shall be prohibited unless it is for public transport or mobility infrastructure, public utility infrastructure like electricity, water or sewerage pipeline or green zone infrastructure"".The ministry also said beyond the no-construction green zone, state govts can plan, develop or regulate the development of residential, commercial, industrial, and institutional infrastructure within a two-km radius on either side of bypass or road. This will facilitate economic activity using the road or bypass as the centre of development in a regulated manner.","No construction will be allowed along 15m on either side of greenfield and access-controlled bypasses and ring roads to be built by union govt.

Mamata Banerjee Slams BJP as Over 300 Bengal Workers Jailed in Rajasthan for Speaking Bengali

NEW DELHI: Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran met West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on Wednesday, signalling a possible reset in ties between the industrial group and the state.The meeting, the first between Mamata Banerjee and a Tata group chairman since Banerjee became chief minister, comes over 17 years after her agitation led to Tata motors pulling out its Nano project from Singur.In a post on X, the TMC said, ""Mamata Banerjje hosted Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Sons and the Tata Group, for a constructive dialogue on Bengal's industrial growth and emerging opportunities. The meeting reflected Bengal's commitment to fostering meaningful public-private partnerships that drive innovation, investment, and inclusive development.""Seventeen years ago, following a protest led by Banerjee against land acquisition for a Tata Motors facility in Singur, the company relocated the plant. At the time, the state was governed by CPM under the late Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.The opposition Trinamool Congress in West Bengal, led by Mamata Banerjee, had led widespread protests after the state government had rejected her demand to return 400 acres land to farmers.In a move that was termed ""sad"" by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Tata announced his exit plan. PM Modi, who was then chief minister of Gujarat, spotted an opportunity and slid into the industrialist's DMs with a 'welcome' text.""When Ratan Tata said in a press conference in Kolkata that they are leaving West Bengal, I sent him a short SMS saying 'welcome'. And now you can see what a Re 1 (worth) SMS can do,"" Modi had said.Production of Nano cars was discontinued in 2018.At the Bengal global business summit (BGBS), held in February this year, Banerjee had said in her speech that the Tata group chairman could not make it to the summit owing to certain exigencies.Banerjee had a detailed discussion with him on the eve of the summit.

BENGALURU: In an apartment complex bustling with software professionals and startup entrepreneurs, no one expected a thief to be living right next door. But residents of GM Infinity in Electronics City Phase 2 were left stunned when police arrested a 26-year-old man for pulling off a string of high-value thefts right under their noses.The accused is Nitesh Subbu, an unemployed graduate from West Bengal, who had been staying with his sister in the same apartment at Thirupalya. Police recovered around 641 grams of gold and 56 grams of silver ornaments, altogether worth Rs 60.4 lakh.Subbu, who previously worked as an assistant in a real estate firm, targeted three locked flats in the apartment.On the night of July 3, he broke into the house of professor Suresh Iyer, 62, who works at Dehradun in Uttarakhand.

NEW DELHI: While Aadhaar was conceived as an identity proof, and not as proof of citizenship, allowing onboarding without real scrutiny, recent moves have meant that only verified adults can enrol for the unique ID. Besides, the Unique Identification Authority of India UIDAI ) is going to tap the online database for passport, ration cards, and birth and matriculation certificates in the future for enrolment of adults and also for updates to ensure that Aadhaar remains foolproof.While Section 9 of the Aadhaar Act states that it is not evidence of citizenship or domicile, the new tools are seeking to ensure only citizens get the unique number.Over the last 15 years, over 140 crore Aadhaars have been generated, including for those who have died, and there is near adult saturation. With infants also now getting Aadhaar soon after birth, govt has decided to tighten the norms for new adult registrations.To thwart attempts by illegal immigrants to get the unique ID based on forged or fake documents, for the last couple of years, the onus has been on states to verify credentials and that Aadhaar is only issued after rigorous checks through a state portal.In the past, there were concerns over illegal immigrants getting Aadhaar and then using it for other purposes, including other IDs.""It is going to be difficult for any illegal immigrant to now get Aadhaar,"" argued an official, indicating a shift from the relaxed, if existent at all, rules of enrolment.Sources said that even if illegal immigrants use Aadhaar to clear the SIR of electoral rolls, there is little possibility of new ones being able to use that as the launchpad for acquiring documents, and most crucially, citizenship.A new tool developed by UIDAI is also going to put a second layer of check for updates as well as enrolments by tapping into documents available online, such as driving licenses, PAN, MNREGS details, and going forward, things like electricity bill. These documents are also in line with the prescriptions for centralized KYC, and ensure a homogenous identity.","Only verified adults can enrol for the unique id.

NEW DELHI: With government indicating that it will set up a statutory inquiry committee as part of impeachment proceedings of Justice Yashwant Varma contrary to its earlier stance, Congress is likely to support the move to sack the judge on corruption charges, even as it plans to use the platform to ""embarrass"" BJP for ignoring similar proceedings against another judge Shekhar Yadav over ""hate speech"".The push in Congress is to use impeachment proceedings to hammer at government's ""selective approach"" against judges. In a rare occurrence, twin impeachment proceedings are hanging fire simultaneously - Varma is facing the charge of corruption after the alleged recovery and burning of cash at his residence, while Allahabad high court judge Shekhar Yadav is in the firing line for his controversial comments about Uniform Civil Code.Interestingly, while central government has announced its intent to bring an impeachment motion against Varma, opposition last Dec filed an impeachment notice against Yadav for ""hate speech"" but govt has maintained silence on it.Senior lawyer and Congress MP Abhishek Singhvi said, ""There should be no double standards in the way govt seeks to approach Varma and Yadav cases. Selectivity and opportunism between the two cases is not good.Both deserve initiation of impeachment process. In Yadav case, govt has already dragged its feet long enough.""Congress sources said the party is expected to support impeachment of Varma in monsoon session of Parliament. Congress functionaries like Singhvi and Vivek Tankha had earlier targeted govt for planning to do away with the inquiry panel provided for in Judges Inquiry Act, and warned that the ""violation"" will lay grounds for Varma's discharge later.Now, sources said, government has since conveyed that it will set up an inquiry committee on Varma.However, a big issue for opposition is ""hate speech"" by Justice Yadav, for which its impeachment notice is pending. Modi govt has not given any indication on taking it up, despite public calls for it by Congress functionaries, and a letter by lawyer-MP Vivek Tankha to Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar.A senior Congress functionary said, ""We are not linking the two issues of impeachment. We will support the move to sack Varma, but we will use the platform to embarrass govt on its selective approach on accountability in the judiciary.""","Justice yashwant varma is facing the charge of corruption after the alleged recovery and burning of cash at his residence.

KANPUR: An eight-year-old boy's courtroom testimony against his mother led to her conviction and death sentence for murdering his three younger brothers by drowning them in a river after sedating them with spiked food at the behest of her lover in Uttar Pradesh's Auraiya last year.""A woman who can kill her children does not have the right to live in society,"" additional district and sessions judge Saif Ahmed said Thursday. Judge Ahmed called it a ""rarest of rare"" crime and handed 30-year-old Priyanka death penalty and a Rs 2.5 lakh fine for killing her sons, aged six, four, and 18 months. Her partner Ashish - who is her dead husband's nephew - was sentenced to life in prison and fined Rs 1 lakh.Investigators said Ashish told Priyanka he would only be with her if she ""got rid of the children"". Priyanka took her four sons to Sengur riverbank in Devarpur after a quarrel with Ashish on June 27, 2024. She had drugged the children and threw them one by one into the water. Locals managed to rescue the eldest boy, who regained consciousness and later testified against his mother. The bodies of the younger boys were found soon after.Police arrested Priyanka and Ashish the next day. During trial, the son's eyewitness account and statements from six others, including Priyanka's brother-in-law, proved crucial for prosecution.""Court classified the crime 'rarest of rare' after it was established beyond doubt that the woman intentionally drowned her children. It's a horrifying act & demands strictest punishment,"" said govt counsel Abhishek Mishra.Priyanka had moved with her children to her parental home after her husband Avnish Kumar died of electrocution while she was pregnant with their fourth child. Facing financial hardship, she later entered into a relationship with Ashish.Since her arrest, Priyanka has been held at Etawah jail. She had expressed repeated desire to meet her firstborn, who now lives with his paternal aunt in Etawah, but the reunion never happened. Outside courtroom, Priyanka's family said they accept the verdict. ""Ashish should have been hanged too,"" Priyanka's aunt Geeta Devi said.Her father Pramod Kumar, a barber, said: ""We never had the money to hire a lawyer or seek bail. We'll approach the President for a pardon.""","Priyanka kumar, 30, was sentenced to death and a rs 2.5 lakh fine for killing her sons.

COIMBATORE: After evading arrest for the past 27 years in the 1998 Coimbatore serial bomb blasts that killed 58 people and left 250 others injured, a key accused, A Sadiq (50), alias Tailor Raja, was arrested from a vegetable market at Vijayapura in Karnataka.Acting on a tip-off, a Coimbatore police team camped in Vijayapura and monitored the movement of Sadiq, and arrested him Wednesday from his shop. Tamil Nadu anti-terrorism squad played a crucial role in the operation. According to sources, Sadiq was a resident of Bilal Estate at Ukkadam, Coimbatore, in 1998. A hardcore Al-Umma cadre, he was an expert in making improvised explosive devices.He had rented a house at Vallal Nagar in Coimbatore, where bombs were manufactured and stored. He distributed bombs to several Al-Umma cadres days before the blasts. Following the serial bombings on Feb 14, Sadiq escaped to Hubballi in Karnataka, where he worked as a daily wage labourer. He married a woman there and had three children, sources said.""He moved to Vijayapura with his family members 15 years ago, where he changed his name to Shajahan. He got an Aadhaar card, driving licence and other documents under the name Shajahan.Initially, he worked at the market and later ran a shop selling chillies,"" said a police officer who was part of the team.""During interrogation, Sadiq denied involvement in the serial bomb blasts. He was shocked about how the police traced his whereabouts,"" the officer added.Sadiq was remanded in judicial custody till July 24, and subsequently lodged at Coimbatore central prison. ATS plans to take him into custody soon for further investigation. Sadiq was also involved in the 1996 petrol bomb attack in Coimbatore, which resulted in the death of a jail warden. Besides, he played a role in the murder of a person in Nagore in 1996 and the 1997 murder of a jailor in Madurai.","A sadiq (50), alias tailor raja, was arrested from a vegetable market at vijayapura in karnataka.

SRINAGAR: J&K CM Omar Abdullah’s National Conference (NC) notified Srinagar district authorities Thursday that it will observe July 13 as Martyrs’ Day, reigniting political contention over the region’s historical memory and post-Article 370 identity.The date marks the killing of 22 civilians outside Srinagar jail in 1931 during protests against Maharaja Hari Singh, then Dogra monarch of J&K.NC also appealed to lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha to reinstate July 13 and Dec 5 as public holidays. Both dates were struck off J&K’s official holiday calendar in Jan 2020, six months after the abrogation of Article 370. Until then, July 13 had been observed annually as Martyrs’ Day, while Dec 5 marked the birth anniversary of NC founder Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah.In a letter to the Srinagar DC, NC said party president Farooq Abdullah and senior functionaries will visit martyrs’ graveyard in the city’s old quarters Sunday morning to lay floral tributes. NC requested security arrangements for the 8am visit.Opposition PDP president Mehbooba Mufti criticised NC’s move, saying the initiative lacked credibility. “Omar Abdullah-led govt’s proposal to the LG would have carried weight had the Speaker supported PDP’s resolution on the matter in the assembly,” she said, referring to the Speaker’s rejection of PDP’s proposal in March.“By dropping PDP’s July 13 Martyrs’ Day resolution, J&K assembly has exposed NC’s double-speak on Kashmir’s history. Their silence proves complicity, not commitment,” Mehbooba said.Apni Party president Altaf Bukhari also weighed in, urging Union govt to officially declare July 13 as Martyrs’ Day. He said his party would visit the graveyard at Naqshband Sahib to pay respect and had already sought permission from authorities.Bukhari used the moment to press for a revision of domicile laws. Addressing CM Abdullah directly, he demanded that the eligibility for J&K domicile be raised from 15 to 50 years of residency.“This is entirely within your authority and discretion. I urge you with folded hands, please, at the very least, do this much for the people of J&K,” he said.",The date marks the killing of 22 civilians outside srinagar jail in 1931 during protests against maharaja hari singh.

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court stayed Thursday the release of 'Udaipur Files' in a rare instance of judicial intervention to pause a movie on the eve of its pan-India opening, reports Abhinav Garg. The film is purportedly based on tailor Kanhaiya Lal's 2022 murder in Udaipur.The court directed Islamic cleric body Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind and other petitioners, which have objected to the movie, to seek a review of its censor certificate. The division bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyaya and Justice Anish Dayal directed the petitioners to approach the Centre within two days with their grievance. Until the Centre takes a call on their revision plea, the film will not be released, the bench said.Kanhaiya Lal was murdered in June 2022 for allegedly sharing a social media post in support of former BJP functionary Nupur Sharma after her controversial comments on Prophet Mohammed.NIA arrested alleged assassins Mohammad Riyaz and Mohammad Ghous. Their trial is pending. The judges pointed “that it is not impermissible for this court to exercise extraordinary jurisdiction even in a case where a petitioner has not exhausted its alternative statutory remedies”.“But having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case… especially the processes to be gone into at the time of grant of certification, we are of the opinion that the petitioner ought to approach the central govt by invoking Section 6 of the (Cinematograph) Act (which deals with revisional powers vested with the central govt),” the high court said.During the hearing, petitioners’ senior counsel Kapil Sibal described the film as “the worst form of hate speech” against a community and an “imminent threat to public order and harmony”. He told the bench he had watched the film in a private screening, as directed by the court. He cited some instances and dialogues to argue the movie was “not art but cinematic vandalism” to vilify a community. Among the scenes Sibal highlighted was one showing arrests of Muslim students.In contrast, additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma, representing the Centre, justified the censor board’s nod and contended that it was a movie based on a crime, not any community. “The film cautions people. It is a crime-specific film. We should all live together — that’s the theme,” Chetan Sharma argued.","The film is purportedly based on tailor kanhaiya lal's 2022 murder in udaipur.

"Bihar SIR: Electoral revision process shows Urban-rural divide; Aadhaar accepted in Patna, not in Seemanchal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-sir-aadhaar-accepted-in-patna-not-in-seemanchal/articleshow/122350645.cms,"Representative image

Poll Do you think the current voter document requirements are clear and easy to follow? No, they’re confusing and inconsistent Yes, the process is manageable

Aadhaar not valid here

PATNA: The special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar has gained pace with 57% (4.5 crore) of the 7.89 crore enrolled voters submitting their enumeration forms by Wednesday. But the process seems to have thrown up an urban-rural divide, TOI found after speaking to officials and people across regions. While officials were seen taking forms on basis of Aadhaar cards in Patna, not many were willing to accept the card in Seemanchal and other parts of rural Bihar, where birth certificates or, in lieu, caste or land allotment documents were being insisted on.TOI hit the ground for a reality check and found that booth level officers (BLOs), Jeevika didis, shiksha mitras and Anganwadi sevikas distributing enumeration forms in villages and towns of Bihar at a rapid pace.In Patna and adjoining areas, voters said they have been asked to fill in and sign the forms and submit a copy of their voter ID cards, Aadhaar, or even ration cards, if they don't have any of the 11 documents required by the Election Commission.Don’t worry, just provide your Aadhaar card,” Rahul Yadav , a ward councillor, was seen telling a group of worried women.Aadhaar and ration cards are not included in the list of 11 documents mandated by the EC, triggering widespread protests from the opposition India Bloc.But, in reality, some BLOs in urban areas like Patna say they have been asked to just get the enumeration forms filled in and signed by existing voters and upload them as the EC itself says the other needed documents can be submitted later. July 25 is the last date to submit forms.Ramashish, of Bikram area in Patna district, said the BLOs distributing the forms had initially asked them to submit the documents listed by the EC.“Since very few people had any of the 11 listed documents, the villagers were reluctant. But now they have been asked to just fill the columns of mother, father, spouse names, Aadhaar card number and mobile number with signature. That may be the reason why the SIR exercise has gained pace in the last few days,” he said.Many voters enrolled in urban areas of East Champaran district are getting their names added to the voter lists of their respective villages where they have landed property, revealed BLOs in Motihari, Raxaul, Sugauli, Areraj and Chakiya.Shiwani, a teacher at Urvarak Nagar in Begusarai, said, “The BLO asked for my voter ID and Aadhaar cards and I faced no difficulty.” Kalyanesh Agrawal of Chatti Road locality in Begusarai said the verification process was smooth.Awadhesh Kumar Singh, principal of SBSS College, Begusarai, said the BLO visited his house and the process was conducted without hassle.In Patna, people were seen at Jan Suvidha Kendras in their areas to get their forms filled. Former councillor Bharti Devi said there was confusion among people about the documents required. “But we are getting the forms filled to submit them to the BLO,” she said.Born in 1949, Dukhani Devi of Mushari Tola feared her name would be struck off the voter list. “Some people in my area said I will not be allowed to vote if I do not submit some papers. I only have an Aadhaar card and voter ID card. Will I be removed from my hut,” she asked. She was told that for now an Aadhaar would do, bringing a smile to her face.However, the real challenge for the EC to seek one of the 11 documents seems to be in Kishanganj, Purnia, Araria and Katihar districts of Seemanchal region, where people did not have proper documents in place and were seen standing in long queues at block offices, desperate to get residential certificates.More than two lakh such applications have been submitted in Kishanganj district alone in the first week of this month. “This is alarming and should be investigated,” BJP’s deputy CM Samrat Choudhary said.About a dozen BLOs in East Champaran district’s rural areas, when contacted, said since the Aadhaar card is not a valid document and birth certificate a must for enrolment as a voter, they suggest that voters provide either a caste certificate or land allotment certificate or any specific family register.At least two to five members of a family have migrated to urban areas for a long time and are not available in the villages.In Rupani village, in Patahi block of East Champaran, around 25 families are facing this problem as they have no papers. “We have voter cards only and have cast our votes on that basis in earlier polls. The BLOs suggested that we enrol where we live,” said a woman voter.Those who are employed somewhere else are also finding it difficult to fill in the form. Shyam Bihari Ojha, a railway employee posted at Bongaon, West Bengal, said he is a resident of Babhangaon near Ara, in Bhojpur district. “I can’t afford to take leave to visit my village for the documents of my parents, as is required among the 11 documents. My father is not even aware of the electoral roll revision. My parents have no birth certificate or any other document, except Aadhaar cards,” he said.Vivek Kumar of village Ratanpur, under Haspura block in Aurangabad district, said his family of 15 electors received only four forms. “We have been asked to attach documents like a copy of a matriculation certificate, Aadhaar card, and residential certificate with each form,” he said. Since all the documents are not available, they might face problems retaining their names on the voter list.Dhananjay Yadav of Baluan, Ara, said he is a zilla parishad member but had not yet got the enumeration form. Satyadev of Bhakura village has 10 eligible voters in his family but got only three forms. Many in Ara, including Kamlesh Kumar, have similar complaints.A BLO in Ara said many voters — particularly the elderly — without birth or any academic certificate are reluctant to furnish their land ownership documents.In Bhagalpur, Indradev Yadav said he and many others were camping at Babupur as their diara area was flooded. “From where will we procure documents?” he asked. Manohar Mandal, Jitendra Kumar, Anil Rai and Bhairo Paswan, also from the riverine area, said this was not the right time for such an exercise.There was a mixed response in Gaya district. While many said the process was easy, some voters complained they had not received forms. Anwar Hussain of Murarpur, in Gaya town, said all his 13 family members filled the forms and handed them to the BLO. Anju Kumari of New Godown area said the BLO collected the forms with a copy of a matriculation certificate attached.","The special intensive revision (sir) of electoral rolls in bihar has gained pace with 57% (4.5 crore) of the 7.89 crore enrolled voters submitting their enumeration forms by wednesday.
