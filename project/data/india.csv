Dekhiye rochak samvaad (Mother came in the sahab's dream. Watch an interesting interaction between them)"". The video portrayed Modi's mother criticising him for his politics.""Is this the level Congress has stooped to? Making memes of our PM's late mother, that too of such a cheap standard. How low will Congress fall?"" senior BJP neta Ravi Shankar Prasad said, adding that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi should respond to such an act by their party colleagues. ""It's shameful... We will make it a Jvery big issue across the country,"" Prasad said.Congress, however,, said no disrespect was shown to the PM or his late mother. ""What is their objection? Just because a mother is trying to educate her son to do something right, where is it disrespectful - neither to the mother, whom we respect dearly, nor to the son,"" Congress media head Pawan Khera said.JDU working president Sanjay Kumar Jha, whose party is a BJP ally, termed Congress's post an ""extremely vile act"" and said with this, the party had proved that hurling abuses at Modi's late mother was part of a ""well-thought-out strategy"".""This is an insult not only to one mother but also to every mother and woman,"" he said. Jha claimed that Congress netas were feeling frustrated witnessing the wave in favour of NDA ahead of the assembly polls in Bihar.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma called the post ""reprehensible"". He added that the people of Bihar would teach them a lesson in the upcoming elections. Union minister Kiren Rijiju said the opposition had lost its credibility and the trust of the people, and yet had not learnt its lesson. ""There is a limit to falling into inhumanity,"" he said.Union minister and LJP (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan said there should be differences in politics, but insulting a mother was absolutely intolerable. ""The people of Bihar are wise; when the time comes, an appropriate response will also be given,"" he added.BJP's Anurag Thakur termed the video ""disgusting and shameful"", and said the opposition party and its allies, including RJD, would face a ""humiliating defeat"" in the polls.","Bihar congress shared an ai-generated video on x depicting pm narendra modi and his late mother heeraben modi.

Earlier, the Ahmednagar district was renamed as Ahilyanagar district, PTI reported.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar , who had pursued the matter, thanked Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw for granting the approval.Chief inmister Devendra Fadnavis and deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde were also involved in the efforts, a statement from Pawar’s office said.Last month, Pawar had written to Vaishnaw urging that the station be renamed to align with the city’s new name.“This long-pending demand has now been fulfilled. The renaming holds special significance as we are celebrating the 300th birth anniversary year of Punyashlok Ahilyadevi Holkar,” Pawar said.Several organisations and citizens had been demanding that the railway station’s name be changed after the city was renamed Ahilyanagar.Pawar also said efforts are underway to rename Aurangabad railway station as Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar railway station.Earlier, a similar thing was done by Karnataka government but that didn't go well with Fadnavis. The Congress government in Karnataka moved to rename Shivajinagar metro rail station in Bengaluru after St Mary.Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah recently said his government would consider renaming Bengaluru's Shivajinagar metro station after St Mary following a request made during the annual feast at St Mary's Basilica. His deputy DK Shivakumar had claimed there is nothing unusual in responding to such community requests.Talking to reporters here, Fadnavis said, ""I condemn the Karnataka government's move to rename Shivajinagar metro station in Bengaluru after St Mary. Its an insult to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The Congress has continued its tradition of insulting the Maratha warrior king since the time of Nehru who made comments against Shivaji Maharaj in his book Discovery of India.""

Police are trying to piece together how the gunshots were fired and what led to the shooting as the two students were considered ""inseparable"" by friends.The incident occurred around 10.30am at RCI Vidya Vihar hostel in Knowledge Park-III. The two students - Deepak Kumar (22) from Andhra Pradesh and Devansh Chauhan (23) from Agra - were both enrolled in the PGDM programme at Birla Institute of Management Technology (Bimtech). They were, however, not roommates. It was in Kumar's room where the shots were fired. Chauhan is in Kailash hospital. His condition is critical.Both bullets came from the same licensed revolver, which was fully loaded and belonged to Chauhan's father Surender Singh Chauhan, who retired as a circle officer in UP STF on Aug 31. Chauhan, who went home last Saturday to attend his father's farewell party, is believed to have sneaked the gun out when he left for his hostel on Tuesday morning itself.Chauhan had reached the hostel barely a couple of hours before the incident.""He had come home on Saturday to attend our father's retirement party. On Tuesday morning, he returned to college. He left home around 5.30am and reached his hostel by 9am. It was around noon that we received a call from the college authorities about the firing incident,"" said Shivang Chaurasia, Chauhan's brother who lives in Gurgaon.Surender Chauhan told TOI he kept the gun in a cupboard in his room. ""It was only a few hours since Chauhan left home. I didn't realise that the gun was missing too.""At Vidya Vihar hostel, it was a guard who first sensed something amiss after hearing faint groans from the locked room. Unable to get any response, he alerted the hostel warden. After repeated attempts to open the door failed, some staff members climbed to the rear balcony with a ladder and peered inside. What they saw was shocking. Inside, Kumar lay dead. Chauhan was groaning in pain.According to the chief medical officer of Kailash hospital, the bullet lodged in Kumar's head was fired from the right side. ""The boy suffered brain death,"" he said.In Chauhan's case too, the bullet was fired from the right. ""The revolver had six bullets. Two were used, four remain. No official complaint has been filed yet,"" the investigating officer said.A police team arrived at the hostel around 11.30am and secured the area.

But, despite scaling down on the political front, “we have been turned into beggars”, he said.“It is better to fight for our rights and be defeated than to resort to begging every day for every small thing,” he asserted.Mehdi, who was invited by the civil society of Anantnag to address people at the town hall, alleged that the district administration locked the building, forcing organisers to change the venue. “People were threatened and intimidated not to attend my meeting. If such tactics are adopted, where are we supposed to go?” he questioned.Referring to the arrest of AAP MLA Mehraj Malik under Public Safety Act, Mehdi said it was a warning to all political voices.Iftikhar Misgar, president of Anantnag Federation of Chambers of Industries Kashmir, said the MP was scheduled to address the gathering at the town hall, but the administration on Thursday declared the building unsafe and locked it, even though forest minister Javed Rana had addressed a gathering there just a day earlier.Reacting to Mehdi’s allegation, former CM and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti said it was “unfortunate” that a sitting MP was not allowed to hold a meeting by his own govt. “At a time when Farooq sahib and Omar sahib are rightly voicing concern over the arrest of MLA Mehraj Malik, such restrictions on their own party’s MP raise serious questions.

At the Khunwa border in UP's Siddharthnagar, Nepalese citizens attempting to buy essentials in India amid shortages in their country were stopped by police and made to return.Indian tourists, pilgrims and labourers stranded in the strife-torn Himalayan nation have also started returning in batches, with the embassy in Kathmandu arranging for their transportation in coordination with Nepalese authorities.Thirty-six trucks from India, including 19 petroleum tankers, drove over to Nepal from Panitanki border point in Darjeeling, while four trucks carrying perishable goods were expected to set off in the evening, taking provisions to the Himalayan country that has been reeling from a goods shortage. Three ambulances were allowed to cross the Panitanki border.","Pilgrims from andhra pradesh were attacked on their bus near kathmandu. The assailants hurled stones at the bus, smashing its windows.

"India expands fast track immigration program to 13 airports, streamlining travel for citizens and OCI holders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-expands-fast-track-immigration-program-to-13-airports-streamlining-travel-for-citizens-and-oci-holders/articleshow/123835474.cms,"Launching the ‘fast track immigration - trusted traveller program’ (FTI-TTP) — which enables faster immigration of pre-verified flyers through automated e-gates — at five more international airports in the country, home minister Amit Shah on Thursday suggested that its coverage be maximised by enabling resident Indians and overseas citizens of India (OCI) to sign up for FTI-TTP at the state of issuing of passports or OCI cards itself.With the inclusion of Lucknow, Amritsar, Thiruvananthapuram, Tiruchirappalli and Kozhikode international airports, the total number of airports covered under the program has risen to 13. First launched at the Indira Gandhi International Airport here in June 2022, the program had added seven more airports — covering Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kochi and Ahmedabad — in January this year. Shah said the facility will be available at the upcoming Navi Mumbai and Jewar airports as well.Addressing the FTI-TTP inauguration event at five airports through video-conference, Shah said around 3 lakh persons had registered under the program and over 2.6 lakh travellers, both inbound and outbound, had availed of it, enabling them to clear immigration in as little as 30 seconds and with no long queues or manual checks.“The next phase of the effort to enhance passenger convenience by integrating Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi Ji’s vision of ‘speed, scale, and scope’ into the FTI-TTP is starting from today,” he said, adding that the program introduces foreign travellers to the positive changes taking place in India.Drawing attention to the 60% increase in international passenger traffic over the past 11 years of Modi govt — from a little over 5 crore in 2014 to 8.1 crore in 2024 — Shah said the figure of 2.6 lakh who have availed of the FTI-TTP facility is too small, leaving tremendous scope to maximise its coverage. Stating that everyone who has availed of the program has voiced appreciation, the home minister said “our goal should be to ensure that every Indian citizen and every OCI cardholder takes advantage of this facility”.“To achieve this, I request that when issuing passports and OCI cards, we can also conduct this registration (under FTI-TTP), so that people don’t have to come twice for fingerprinting or document verification. Whenever they travel, they can simply use their passport. I think we must further explore the technological possibilities to maximize the number of people who can take advantage of this program,” he added.",Fti-ttp enables faster immigration of pre-verified flyers through automated e-gates.

However, Supreme Court on Friday ensured that the ""offence"" did not go unpunished by directing the VC to make the judgment, which recorded his alleged acts in detail, part of his resume.A bench of Justices Pankaj Mithal and Prasanna B Varale passed the peculiar order while dismissing the plea filed by the faculty member. The court noted that the last instance of alleged sexual harassment had taken in April 2023 but the ""victim"" lodged a formal complaint in Dec 2023 with the local complaint committee which rejected the complaint as 'time barred' since it was not only beyond the prescribed period of limitation of three months but also beyond the extendable period of limitation of six months.Section 9 of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act says that any aggrieved woman may make a complaint to LCC within a period of three months from the date of incident, and in the case of series of incidents, within a period of three months from the date of the last incident. The second proviso to Section 9 provides that the LCC may for reasons to be recorded in writing, extend the time of making the complaint not exceeding three months.Noting that nothing could be done in the case, the bench, however, ensured that the alleged wrong acts are not forgotten. ""It is advisable to forgive the wrongdoer, but not to forget the wrongdoing. The wrong which has been committed against the appellant (faculty member) may not be investigated on technical grounds, but it must not be forgotten. In this view of the matter, we direct that the incidents of alleged sexual harassment on part of respondent No. 1 (VC) may be forgiven but allowed to haunt the wrongdoer forever. Thus, it is directed that this judgment shall be made part of the resume of respondent No. 1, compliance of which shall be strictly ensured by him personally,"" the court said in its order.The complainant had alleged that the VC repeatedly used to call her in his office and proposed to her to go out for dinner. She had told him that she was not comfortable and wanted to keep the relationship professional only but he went on demanding ""sexual favour from her and threatened her if the offers were declined.""""A plain reading of the entire complaint would reveal that the sexual harassment, if any, of the appellant at the hands of respondent no. 1 commenced sometime in Sept 2019, and the last incident in that connection took place in April 2023. Thereafter, no incident of sexual harassment is alleged to have taken place except for the fact that on Aug 29, 2023, the appellant was removed from the post of director, Centre of Financial, Regulatory and Governance Studies (CFRGS) or that a preliminary inquiry was instituted against her by the executive council,"" the court said while holding that subsequent actions of removing her as director could not be in any way linked to sexual harassment to make her plea within the time limitation.",A sexual harassment complaint by a faculty member of west bengal national university of juridical sciences against its vice chancellor (vc) could not be looked into because it was not lodged within the mandatory three-month period.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123859474,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-50612,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Are crackers the primary source of pollution? Or is it because the Delhiites are elite? Or is it because the Supreme Court is situated in Delhi that it can be easily approached and a ban can be sought on crackers citing pollution?"" The CJI said, ""Last winter, I went to Amritsar and found it more polluted than Delhi. On the same yardstick, a ban on crackers should apply to all towns which are polluted.""SC sought a report from CAQM and NEERI on a plea by cracker manufacturers association, who through senior advocate K Parameshwar said the ban has jeopardised the industry and livelihood of lakhs of people employed therein. The manufacturers said they are ready to conform to any green standard for crackers framed by expert bodies.Amicus curiae and senior advocate Aparajita Singh said the elite leave Delhi or use air purifiers during winters to avoid pollution and that it is the poor who sleep on footpaths or reside in slums who suffer the most from pollution.The CJI said, ""Do the poor not suffer when they are rendered jobless by imposing a complete ban on all kinds of firecrackers?"" Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati said NEERI and CAQM are examining the standards that could be put in place for green crackers and promised to get back to the court with a report by Sept 22.Parameshwar complained to the court that based on the April 3 ban, the authorities are revoking the firecracker licences of manufacturers and dealers. The bench asked the authorities to hold their hand by ordering status quo on the licences.Manufacturers said crackers have already been subject to intense regulations through a series of SC orders, which permitted sale of only green crackers and banned use of chemicals like lithium, arsenic, antimony, lead and mercury.""It would be extremely onerous and arbitrary to impose a complete and perpetual ban on firecrackers in the entire NCR (consisting of 25 districts) when the industry is already being regulated to balance the protection of livelihood of people with minimsation of environmental harm,"" they said.The bench led by Justice Oka had taken serious note of its Oct 14, 2024 order banning bursting of crackers during Diwali in Delhi getting flouted. The bench had refused to exempt 'green crackers' from the ambit of ban saying it would not permit these crackers unless it is proved that they cause ""bare minimum pollution"".","Supreme court sought a report on the feasibility of permitting green crackers from commission for air quality management and neeri by sept 22.

Their contribution is both unprecedented and seminal,"" says social activist Nikhil De, co-founder of the NGO, Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan.Before every poll, state or national, journalists would receive a detailed account of each MP or MLA's family connection, financial record, and sundry information available in the public domain.Born in Kharar, a small town near Chandigarh, Chhokar trained as a mechanical engineer and was employed with the railways. But he eventually took the MBA route earning his PhD from Louisiana State University. In an interview with journalist Ajaz Ashraf, he recounted how IG Patel, the famed director of IIM, Ahmedabad, sent him a cable from New York, asking for a meeting. Chhokar cheekily replied, only if Patel paid for the flight and put him up in the same hotel. He received the job on the phone. Chhokar would retire as IIM Ahmedabad's director-in-charge in 2006.But years before that, a younger colleague, Trilochan Sastry, incensed at the growing trend of criminals in politics, would urge him to do something. In a Ted Talk, Chhokar admitted to spending three months trying to convince Sastry that professors like them shouldn't get involved in such things. But eventually he stepped in. In 1999, ADR filed a public interest litigation (PIL) on the matter. It was the beginning of his life as an activist and the formation of an enduring collaboration with Sastry.De recalls how during his public addresses Chhokar would often ask the audience, ""Who elects our political candidates?"" When people replied, ""we do,"" he would say, no, before pointing out that voters were presented a fait accompli and people only elected candidates selected by political parties. ""The parties decide the candidates, you don't,"" he would say. Chhokar's life, says De, was dedicated to creating an electoral system which was more transparent and accountable to the common people and which empowered them in every way.His passing was widely mourned. RTI activist Lokesh Batra said, ""he was a fearless leader who carried people along and who spoke his mind without mincing any words."" In his post, political activist Yogendra Yadav described Chhokar as ""humble and self-effacing to the core."" Activist Harsh Mander called him ""a gentle giant"". ADR's tribute said, ""To those who knew him, he was more than an advocate for clean politics, he was a generous mentor, an incisive thinker, and a warm friend.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday said any undue delay in deciding bail pleas is an injustice and violative of the accused's fundamental rights while setting a timeline of two months for trial and high courts to decide bail and anticipatory bail applications.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said liberty of citizens cannot be left in abeyance by keeping bail plea hanging for a long time and took strong objection to Bombay high court keeping an anticipatory bail plea pending for nearly six years.""Applications concerning personal liberty can't be kept pending for years while applicants remain under a cloud of uncertainty. The consistent line...of this court makes it abundantly clear that bail and anticipatory pleas must be decided expeditiously without relegating the parties to a state of indefinite pendency. Prolonged delay not only frustrates the object of Code of Criminal Procedure but also amounts to denial of justice, contrary to constitutional ethos reflected in Articles 14 and 21 (relating to fundamental rights),"" the bench said.It directed the HCs to ensure that pleas for bail and anticipatory bail pending before them or before courts under their jurisdiction are disposed of expeditiously, preferably within two months from date of filing, except in cases where delay is attributable to the parties themselves.It asked HCs to issue necessary administrative directions to subordinate courts to prioritise matters involving personal liberty and avoid indefinite adjournments.""This court has consistently underscored, in a long line of decisions, that applications affecting personal liberty - particularly bail and anticipatory bail - ought not to be kept pending indefinitely. The grant or refusal of bail, anticipatory or otherwise, is ordinarily a straightforward exercise, turning on the facts of each case. There is, therefore, no justification for deferring decision-making and allowing a sword of Damocles to hang over the applicant's head. In matters concerning liberty, bail courts must be sensitive and ensure that constitutional ethos is upheld. While docket explosion remains a chronic challenge, cases involving personal liberty deserve precedence,"" the apex court said.The court was hearing an appeal challenging Bombay HC's order rejecting anticipatory bail plea of an accused. The bail plea was filed in 2019 but the HC decided it in 2025. Though Supreme Court upheld the HC order, it criticised the HC for keeping the applications pending for six years.""Being the highest constitutional fora in the states, high courts must devise suitable mechanisms and procedures to avoid accumulation of pending bail/anticipatory bail applications and ensure that the liberty of citizens is not left in abeyance,"" it said.",Supreme court sets a timeline of two months for trial and high courts to decide bail and anticipatory bail applications.
