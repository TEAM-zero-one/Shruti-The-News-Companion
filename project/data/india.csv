Did basmati kill basmati?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/did-basmati-kill-basmati/articleshow/124189584.cms,"It has been described as the 'best rice in the world' by Taste Atlas, more evocatively as 'karza faad' (debt-breaker) by farmers, and even found a place in the tragic love story of Heer Ranjha written by famous Punjabi poet Waris Shah in the 18th century. Today, this aromatic variety is used to whip up everything from biryanis and kheers to foreign dishes like sushi. It has also sparked a cross-border row, with Pakistan looking to benefit from the 50% duty imposed by the Trump administration on Indian exports.Yet, a less-known fact about the much-feted basmati rice is that it is also a silent killer. The victim: traditional varieties of basmati and non-basmati rice that were once grown and consumed across India but have now nearly vanished from farms and dining tables.Agrarian scientist Debal Deb, who has been working on rice seed conservation for the last two decades, estimates that 60-80% of the rice bought off the shelf is not the variety claimed on the packet. ""The biggest challenge today is that farmers use cross-pollination and don't maintain genetic purity,"" says the Odisha-bases researcher.But before villainising the hybrids, it's important to understand the context in which they came about.India's desperate need for self-sufficiency in food grains led to agricultural research scientists creating sturdier grains of rice like the Pusa Basmati (PB) 1121 and PB 1509 over the years. These varieties could cope with the constant onslaught of pests and diseases such as bacterial blight and responded well to chemical fertilisers. This not only fed more mouths, it also meant that farmers, even those with small landholdings, gained from higher yield and fewer losses. Soon, large swathes of land in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh shifted to these hybrid varieties. This shift helped India become the largest producer of basmati rice, supplying 65% of global demand, with Pakistan accounting for most of the rest.However, this has come at a cost of traditional varieties. Across India, rice seed varieties have come down from 1,00,000 in the 1970s to less than 6,000 - a loss of 93%.Traditional strains such as Veliyan rice in Kerala, which is drought-resistant, or Jengoni in Assam, known for its medicinal qualities, are rarely cultivated.Umendra Dutt, founder of the Kheti Virasat Mission that works in conserving indigenous seeds and traditional methods of cultivation in Punjab and Haryana, says that the region had lost all its paddy varieties. ""When we started the mission in 2005, we had to get seeds from other parts of the country to bring traditional varieties back to our farms,"" he says. Over the past two decades, Punjab's Malwa region, where this initiative is based, has seen a surge of cancer cases that studies have linked to excessive and inappropriate use of pesticides and chemical fertilisers.""It was only after we found out how much damage had been done that we encouraged farmers to adopt organic methods and switch to traditional crops,"" Dutt says. The Mission conserves and distributes 10-12 varieties of rice.Deb, also called the Seed Warrior, says while not all the loss is directly due to basmati, the dominance of basmati in its traditional growing regions has accelerated the decline of other varieties. ""Farmers behave like businessmen who are seeking profits. They have no interest in conserving,"" he says.At Basudha, a 1.7-acre farm in Odisha's Rayagada district, Deb has been working towards conservation of 1,492 rice landraces (traditional strains) collected from farmers in India and abroad, including Sri Lanka, Thailand, Korea, Italy and the US. Beyond seed preservation, he has built awareness around genetic purity and the importance of crop diversity. The Vrihi Seed Exchange Network he started now connects over 8,000 farmers in 12 states who cultivate and exchange seeds among themselves. Vrihi also documents varieties rich in vitamin B complex, essential omega-3 fatty acids and those that can withstand drought, flood, salinity, or resist pests and diseases.In Assam's Jorhat, Mahan Chandra Borah, who has been working on saving seeds for the last two decades, criticises the profit-driven approach. ""This monoculture is destroying our living heritage. Conserving these seeds is necessary for sustainable food security in the future,"" he says. Borah recalls how his village, Meleng Kathgaon, would cultivate 10-12 varieties of rice when he was a child. ""The next village grew other varieties which were different from ours and we would exchange seeds. But now the landraces are down to a handful,"" he says. He conserves over 500 varieties through the Annapurna Seed Library.He highlights the benefits of conservation: farmers growing traditional varieties regain control over food production and reduce dependence on costly commercial seeds. Yet, he warns that the impact of individual farmers is limited. ""There is no govt initiative for conservation. All govt-run research institutes are focused on genetic engineering,"" he says.",India's need for self-sufficiency led to scientists creating sturdier grains of rice. These varieties could cope with the constant onslaught of pests and diseases. This shift helped india become the largest producer of basmati rice. But this has come at a cost of traditional varieties.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124189594,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-766999,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

President, PM condole deaths

KARUR: Thirty nine people died in a stampede during TVK leader Vijay ’s campaign in Karur on Saturday evening, Tamil Nadu health minister Ma Subramanian said. The deceased included 10 children, 17 women and 12 men. More than 80 people have been admitted to hospitals.The govt has formed a one-man commission headed by Justice (retired) Aruna Jagadeesan to inquire into the stampede.Chief minister M K Stalin announced Rs 10 lakh as ex gratia to the families of those who died in the stampede. Stalin would leave for Karur tonight.Earlier, Stalin directed officials and ministers to ensure immediate medical assistance for those who fainted in a crowd and were admitted to hospital.Stalin tweeted that he had instructed former minister V Senthilbalaji, health minister Ma Subramanian, and the Karur collector to oversee treatment on priority. He also asked school education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi to extend support “on a war footing.”Stalin added that he had spoken to the ADGP to take steps to bring the situation under control swiftly. He appealed to the public to cooperate with doctors and police in managing the situation.Vijay who returned to Chennai late at night tweeted, “I am heartbroken; I am writhing in unbearable, indescribable pain and sorrow. I express my deepest sympathies and condolences to the families of our dear brothers and sisters who lost their lives in Karur. I pray for a speedy recovery for those undergoing treatment in the hospital.”Veluswamypuram, the location permitted by police for the TVK’s rally on Karur-Erode state highway, was completely crowded. Vijay reached the venue in the evening after his campaign in Namakkal town.“Everything was normal until Vijay came to the campaign venue. Suddenly, floodlights connected to a generator turned off, after that one woman started to search for her missing child, people panicked, and the mass helter-skelter,” said said R K Nirmal, a survivor.Nirmal, a native of Karur working in an IT firm in Chennai, was yet to recover from the shock. Caught at ground zero, Nirmal and a few others in the TVK election rally site at Veluswamypuram on Saturday evening had panicked due to the frenzy crowd, had managed to save a few people among the crowd, but it was too late to save a few others who were already trapped and stuck under vehicles.Compared to the previous venues of TVK leader's campaign, Karur was the most disorganised event, cadres and fans were standing a few inches away from the campaign vehicle. Many of the cadres and fans assembled did not anticipate the things to head south. However, there were indications for the disaster. Actor Vijay was speaking on top of his campaign vehicle and was intervened by his senior party man Aadhav Arjuna, general secretary – elections. Then the actor was heard appealing to the people and police. Ashmika, a 9-year-old girl, was missing, the public address system said. Vijay also appealed to the police to help. The actor’s speech was cut short; it appears that organizers in TVK have realized something has gone wrong mid-way.Ezhil M from Karur, who had been waiting at the venue since around 3am, said, ""There was no proper organization. We didn’t even have access to drinking water.""""As the songs kept playing, the crowd grew more and more excited. People started collapsing, one after another. Vijay saw that and that's why he cut short his speech. We were all scared and just started running once it grew uncontrollable,"" he said.Ramesh V, another eyewitness, recalled a moment that triggered panic in the crowd. ""When Vijay sang the song criticising V Senthilbalaji as the '10-rupees minister', the crowd erupted. The energy shifted and suddenly the police began using lathis, and people panicked. Everyone started pushing forward, including parents holding babies. It was chaos."" Both of whom attended the campaign said.President Droupadi Murmu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Governor R N Ravi condoled the deaths of people in the stampede.“Anguished to know about the tragic loss of lives in a stampede-like unfortunate incident in Karur district of Tamil Nadu. I extend my deepest condolences to the bereaved family members and pray for early recovery of those injured,” the President said.“The unfortunate incident during a political rally in Karur, Tamil Nadu, is deeply saddening. My thoughts are with the families who have lost their loved ones. Wishing strength to them in this difficult time. Praying for a swift recovery to all those injured,” Modi posted on X.""Deeply pained and anguished by the tragic loss of innocent lives, including children, during a political rally in Karur. My heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families in this time of grief and prayers for the speedy recovery of those injured,” Ravi posted on X.","The deceased included 10 children, 17 women and 12 men.

NEW DELHI: Patiala house court on Wednesday heard arguments on the bail plea of Gaganpreet Kaur, who has been in custody for ten days following her arrest in connection with a culpable homicide case.The court directed Delhi Police to produce CCTV footage and other evidence to support their case. Both the defence counsel and the public prosecutor were asked to file written submissions. The matter has been listed for further hearing tomorrow, 25 September, at 2 pm.Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) opposed Kaur’s bail plea, telling the court, “The intention of the accused was not to save the injured rather to save herself from legal proceedings.”However, Kaur’s counsel countered this claim, arguing, “The intention of the accused is misconceived. She is not a doctor and did not have the knowledge that in how much time the patient may die.”The defence stressed that the case did not fall under culpable homicide not amounting to murder.“She is not seeking an anticipatory bail, she is in custody for 10 days after her arrest,” the counsel said.The lawyer further told the court that Kaur is not a flight risk and has fully cooperated with investigators. “Her mobile and drive have been handed over to the police when it was asked,” the counsel submitted.Emphasising the family’s circumstances, the defence added: “The entire family is victim and all the evidence is with the police.”",Gaganpreet kaur has been in custody for ten days following her arrest in connection with a culpable homicide case.

NEW DELHI: An image of Jesus Christ inside a 'Vatican City-themed' Durga Puja pandal in Ranchi was replaced on Friday with that of Lord Krishna.The development came following objections raised by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). The VHP alleged that the marquee, organised by R R Sporting Club at Ratu Road, was made to ""hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus"" and encourage conversion. The organisers had rejected these charges earlier on Thursday.The club’s patron Vicky Yadav said the decision was taken by the puja committee members and not due to protests by any section, reports news agency PTI. “It was not due to the protest by a certain section but by our committee members to show all religions on the same platform,” he said. He said that European-style statues placed outside the pandal were retained.Yadav claimed that the design aimed to promote peace and brotherhood. ""India stands for religious harmony. If that doesn’t exist, then why not just declare this a Hindu nation?"" he asked, showing videos of Prime Minister Narendra Modi visiting churches abroad during official trips.He said the idea was inspired by India’s multi-faith culture and that the club promotes Sanatan Dharma..""We have been organising Durga Puja for the last 50 years, and every year we make pandals based on certain themes. This year, we decided to replicate the Durga Puja pandal made by Sreebhumi Sporting Club in Kolkata in 2022 on the theme of Vatican City,"" Yadav said.VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal had expressed concern on Thursday on X, saying, ""This has been done with an objective to hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus and aimed at encouraging religious conversion.

SRINAGAR: Authorities in Ladakh allowed Saturday a four-hour curfew relaxation in Leh amid public outrage over the arrest of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk and police defending the use of force that left four people dead and about 80 wounded during clashes on Sept 24.Magsaysay Award winner Wangchuk was held Friday under NSA and shifted to Jodhpur central jail in Rajasthan, a prison known for housing gangsters, terrorists, film stars, and convicts like Asaram. Sources said he has been placed in a separate cell, kept in complete isolation, and attended to directly by jail staff. Authorities refused to disclose reasons for his transfer to the high-security desert facility.Police accused Wangchuk of making “provocative” remarks during his Sept 9–24 hunger strike for Sixth Schedule status and statehood for Ladakh, and of derailing talks with govt. The curfew was clamped after violence during a shutdown called by Leh Apex Youth, part of the Leh Apex Body — an alliance of political and religious groups.Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA) accused authorities of “shoot-on-sight” firing without warning and with intent to kill. Ladakh DGP SD Singh Jamwal countered: “Security forces fired in self-defence to stop the attack… CRPF deployment was not pre-planned. They helped save lives as some protesters tried to set security quarters on fire.”He rejected accusations of violating procedures, alleging around 6,000 protesters went on a rampage, damaging govt offices, torching a political party office, and setting the LAHDC building ablaze. He said 15 police and 17 CRPF personnel were also wounded.The DGP said 44 arrests were made, including Wangchuk, whom he accused of making statements referencing Nepal and Bangladesh, and recently traveling to Pakistan. He said Wangchuk’s foreign funding under FCRA is under scrutiny, with investigators probing links to a Pakistani “person of interest”.KDA rejected those claims and demanded a judicial probe. “The firing was carried out without any magistrate’s order or warning. Bullets were fired at people’s heads and chests. It seems govt intended to kill Ladakhis and we strongly condemn it,” said KDA co-chairman Asgar Ali Karbalai.He described Wangchuk as a “peace-loving Gandhian” and dismissed charges against him as “fiction writing”. He demanded his immediate release. “He never believed in violence. Any fabricated stories against Sonam Wangchuk will not be accepted,” Karbalai said, appealing to Union govt to meet Ladakh’s “legitimate and constitutional” demands.BJP functionary and LAHDC-Leh chairman Tashi Gyalson termed Sept 24 the “darkest day in the history of Ladakh” and said he has written to LG Kavinder Gupta seeking a full probe.Leh Bar Association also defended Wangchuk. “To brand him as anti-national would make India a laughing stock worldwide. People do not accept such allegations,” it said. Taking up the matter pro bono, the bar demanded answers on “why firing was ordered on people”.In Jodhpur, police tightened security outside the jail after detaining a man who turned up in support of Wangchuk. The jail holds Asaram, convicted of rape in 2018, and has earlier housed figures such as gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, ex-ministers Mahipal Maderna and Malkhan Singh Bishnoi in the Bhanwari Devi case, and actor Salman Khan, who served brief terms after blackbuck poaching convictions in 2006 and 2018. During the 1980s, it also held militants from Punjab and J&K for security reasons.","Activist kept in isolation in jodhpur jail, cops accuse him of pak links.

Calcutta High Court on Friday struck down Centre’s decision to deport two women and their families from Birbhum, West Bengal, to Bangladesh.The court said the deportation was illegal and ordered that all six people, including three children, be brought back to India within a month. The court also dismissed the Centre’s request for a temporary stay on the order.Petitions were filed by family members of Sonali Bibi and Sweety Bibi, both from Paikar in Murarai, Birbhum.The women said their husbands and children had been living and working in Delhi for over 20 years as daily wage earners. On June 18, Delhi Police detained them on suspicion of being Bangladeshi nationals. Nine days later, on June 27, they were deported across the border. Reports said they were later arrested by the Bangladesh police.Sonali’s family told the court that she was nine months pregnant when deported, raising fears about her newborn’s citizenship if the child was born in Bangladesh.Lawyers for the families argued that the deportation was carried out despite them showing proper documents, including land papers, voter ID cards of their parents and grandparents, and birth certificates of their children issued by government hospitals.The Centre, in its affidavit, said the plea was not valid before the Calcutta High Court since petitions had already been filed in the Delhi High Court. It also argued that Delhi Police acted under instructions from the ministry of home affairs, which had issued a memo in May 2025 detailing the process for deporting Bangladeshi or Myanmar nationals.After the judgment, Trinamool Congress MP Samirul Islam said the court’s order exposed the BJP’s attempt to brand poor Bengali families as illegal immigrants wrongly. Calling it a “victory for Bengal,” he said the deportation was part of an anti-Bengali, anti-poor agenda.","Calcutta high court on friday struck down centre’s decision to deport two women and their families from birbhum, west bengal.

NEW DELHI: Around 5,000–6,000 protesters poured into Leh's streets this Wednesday, their anger spilling over into arson and stone-pelting. Government buildings were damaged, a BJP office was attacked, and vehicles set ablaze as the agitation over Ladakh's demands for statehood turned violent. Security forces responded with tear gas, baton charges, and even firing, leaving 17 CRPF personnel injured and more than 70 civilians hurt.In the aftermath of the chaos, Ladakh's director general of police SD Singh Jamwal defended the arrest of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk, saying his protest platform provided space for violence to erupt. Jamwal said investigators were probing a possible Pakistan link, pointing to Wangchuk's prior visits across the border and alleged interactions with Islamabad-based officials. ""Planning and coordination was done beforehand,"" the DGP claimed, insisting the arrest was necessary to prevent further escalation.During the briefing, the DGP said that the government is already working with the Leh Apex Body and KDA, but environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk is demanding 6th Schedule status and statehood, creating obstacles and “sabotaging” the decision-making process.Ladakh DGP Dr SD Singh Jamwal said: ""Ever since Ladakh became a UT, there has been a political demand here for 6th Schedule and Statehood.Leh Apex Body and KDA have had lengthy discussions with the government...This is an ongoing process but attempts were also being made to sabotage and vitiate this process. A so-called environmental activist and other such groups with a question mark on their credibility attempted to hijack this platform. The first name here is Sonam Wangchuk. He had said and done things earlier as well to derail this process...The hunger protest was made a platform where elements were invited to vitiate peace & law and order here...Preliminary talks were already planned on 25-26 September in Delhi.Also read: Arrest of Sonam Wangchuk condemned; environmentalists plan campaigns against NSA A Pakistan PIO linked to Sonam Wangchuk was arrested, and an investigation is underway.

We have a record of this. He had attended a Dawn event in Pakistan. He also visited Bangladesh. So, there is a big question mark on him...Investigation is being done.""""Sonam Wangchuk has had a history of instigating. He has referred to the Arab Spring, Nepal and Bangladesh.

He claimed “CRPF jawans were brutally beaten up, one jawan is still in hospital with a serious spinal injury… 4 women Police personnel were in the same building when it was set on fire… firing was done in self-defence and 4 lives were lost.” He added that 70–80 security personnel and a similar number of civilians were injured, including a girl who had to be airlifted to Delhi.The DGP described how 32 people were severely injured on the first day, and he himself was attacked but survived with minor injuries.""Firing was done in self-defence and 4 lives were lost. 32 people were severely injured on the first day and after that several more were injured. I too was attacked but I luckily survived with minor injuries...Of the severely injured personnel, 17 were from CRPF and 15 from Ladakh Police...Later, the number rose to 70-80. 70-80 civilians were also injured.
