From Bihar to the nation: A wider SIR looms



Concerns about due process and transparency

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: A political and legal battle is underway over the Election Commission’s Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar. What was intended as a technical exercise to improve the accuracy of voter lists has escalated into a flashpoint in both Parliament and the Supreme Court, with opposition parties alleging disenfranchisement and voter fraud, while the poll body insists it is a necessary step to uphold electoral integrity.The Supreme Court is set to hear a petition today challenging the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar, as the Opposition intensifies its attack on the government over the exercise. Led by the Congress, opposition parties have accused the Centre of using the revision process to target voters just months before the state heads to elections. The row over SIR has gained fresh momentum in Parliament as well, with protests disrupting proceedings of the House over the past week.The Election Commission of India (ECI) launched the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in Bihar on June 24. As per the centre, the objective was to update and clean up the electoral roll through house-to-house verification by Booth Level Officers (BLOs). The last such exercise in the state was conducted in 2003. With Bihar undergoing rapid urbanisation, youth enrolment, and internal migration, the ECI said the revision was crucial for ensuring accurate rolls ahead of state elections.While the Monsoon session was set to debate Operation Sindoor, the SIR exercise quickly became a parallel point of contention. INDIA bloc MPs have submitted multiple notices demanding a discussion on the matter, alleging that the SIR was being used to remove genuine voters from rolls. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju clarified that the Operation Sindoor debate would take priority, pushing SIR-related discussions to a later date — a decision that drew strong reactions from the Opposition.The Supreme Court is hearing a batch of pleas challenging the SIR. Petitioners argue that the exercise lacks legal safeguards and risks disenfranchising large swathes of the population. The lead petitioner, NGO Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), claimed the exercise is ""arbitrary"" and violates Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. The court has also questioned the exclusion of Aadhaar and ration cards as valid ID for voter verification.According to the EC, the SIR saw over 7.24 crore of Bihar’s 7.89 crore electors participate, a turnout rate of nearly 92%. However, multiple affidavits and field reports challenge this figure, suggesting enumeration forms were uploaded en masse by BLOs without voter consent. ADR and other petitioners claimed that even dead people were shown to have submitted forms, raising concerns of systemic fraud to meet internal targets.In its latest press note dated July 27, the Election Commission clarified the status of the 35 lakh voters flagged as missing. According to the ECI, many were found to have moved to other states or union territories, some were deceased, others did not submit their enumeration forms, and a few were simply not willing to register. The Commission emphasised that their exact status will be confirmed only after scrutiny by EROs and AEROs by 1 August. Importantly, all genuine electors can still be added during the claims and objections period starting 1 August.Over 5.7 crore SMSes were sent to registered mobile numbers, 29 lakh forms were submitted digitally, and BLOs made multiple home visits. Volunteers also assisted senior citizens, PwDs, and vulnerable groups in accessing forms and filing appeals, with training provided for redressal mechanisms.The EC has said that no name will be deleted without a “speaking order” and due notice. The draft rolls will be published on August 1, and electors or parties can file claims or objections till September 1. Appeals can be made to the District Magistrate or CEO if needed.In a detailed affidavit to the Supreme Court, the ECI defended the SIR as essential for removing ineligible voters and ensuring free and fair elections. Citing Articles 326 and provisions of the Representation of People Act, the Commission insisted it was fulfilling its constitutional duty. EC also claimed all major political parties were consulted and that over 1.5 lakh Booth Level Agents were deployed. However, the ADR contested that no political party had asked for a complete overhaul.In its June 24 directive, the ECI announced that SIR will eventually be conducted nationwide. With 96.88 crore voters in India, even a small error rate could affect millions. ANI said the findings in Bihar have heightened concerns about systemic issues that could emerge in other states, especially where similar migration patterns exist. The draft electoral rolls will be published on August 1, with a window for objections open until September 1.Critics say the SIR is being conducted in a way that violates procedural fairness. ADR’s affidavit to the court alleged that forms were submitted by BLOs without physical verification, and that there were no proper channels for redress. The EC has argued that appeals can be made under Section 24 of the RP Act, but complainants say awareness and accessibility are limited. With conflicting narratives and high stakes, the SIR has now evolved from a bureaucratic exercise to a national controversy.",The supreme court is set to hear a petition challenging the special intensive revision (sir) of electoral rolls in bihar.

Two devotees were electrocuted and several others injured outside the historic Awshaneshwar Mahadev temple after they came in contact with an iron pipe and tin shed that had reportedly developed an electric current in Barabanki district in the wee hours of Monday.DM Barabanki, Shashank Tripathi, confirmed to TOI that two people died and 19 were injured.The structure was installed for the safety and convenience of devotees amid the ongoing monsoon season.Police said that the identities of the deceased were being ascertained.Local authorities and police personnel reached the spot immediately after the incident and initiated necessary procedures.Eyewitnesses claimed that the accident occurred when both victims tried to take shelter under the tin shed during rainfall.

He manipulatively estranged her from daughter, says 1st wife

NEW DELHI: Can a marriage solemnised between a man and a woman belonging to the Kuki tribe in a church be dissolved by the Songpijan village committee and 'gaonburas (village elders)' in Assam's Dima Hasao district on proceedings initiated by the husband relying on customary law?The Gauhati HC had said once a marriage takes place in a church in terms with the Christian Marriage Act, 1872, it cannot be annulled by customary law practices involving village elders. Such a marriage can only be dissolved through proceedings initiated before the HC or the district judge as per section 10 of the Divorce Act, 1869, it had said.This HC ruling landed the Indian ambassador to Cuba, Thongkomang Armstrong Changsan, in a piquant matrimonial situation as he ended up with two wives. Prior to the HC declaring in 2022 that his 1994 church marriage with Neikhol Changsan subsisted, he had married another woman after the customary divorce. From both marriages, he has a daughter each.After failure of the mediation ordered by the Supreme Court, during pendency of Changsan's appeal, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi on Friday orally observed that the HC judgment is legally sound. Finding that the Indian Foreign Service officer is now married for nearly a decade and half, it decided to find a solution to this legal-matrimonial complexity and help the first wife start a new life.The ambassador said he has been paying a monthly maintenance of Rs 20,000 to Neikhol and has given her a house in Delhi.Neikhol argued the case herself and told the court that she had single handedly brought up her daughter without any participation from her husband.Neikhol, the first wife, alleged that he has now manipulatively estranged her daughter (29) from her. For the ambassador, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy said the father had been meeting the expenses of his daughter, who is pursuing a career in Bengaluru.Neikhol appealed to SC to ""protect her honour and dignity"" while describing how surreptitiously Changsan dissolved the marriage using tribal community elders, and remarried. The Justice Kant-led bench said, ""We have absolutely no sympathy for the man. The HC judgment is in your favour, and you have suffered socially and mentally. But can you think of a way to start life afresh?""Interestingly, 'Kuki Inpi' of Assam, the highest governing body of the Kuki tribe in the state, has said Kuki customary law can neither dissolve a Christian marriage performed in church nor can it force any couple to reunite against the will of the couple.SC said it could be profitable for Neikhol to meet her daughter and discuss future course of action, and asked the ambassador to arrange for her flight tickets to Bengaluru, a place of stay near her daughter's place, and pay her an ad hoc amount of Rs 3 lakh to enable her to meet her daughter.""If at all there is a possibility of settlement, the daughter could have a significant role to play,"" Justice Kant said, adding that the IFS officer must advise his daughter to re-establish contact with her mother.","Sc says it has no sympathy for cuba envoy thongkomang armstrong changsan.

Justice Verma Removal Case Sparks BJP-Congress Face-Off Amid VP Jagdeep Dhankhar’s Shock Resignation

LS Speaker may write to CJI this week for panel members’ names

NEW DELHI: Facing removal motion in Parliament for sacks of cash found at his official residence in Delhi, Justice Yashwant Varma has kept his identity a secret in his petition in the Supreme Court while seeking quashing of the in-house inquiry report and then CJI's recommendation for stripping him of judgeship.A bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Augustine George Masih is scheduled to hear his petition on Monday. In the petition, his name is described as ""XXX"". Such camouflage is used in records of SC and HCs to hide the identity of petitioner women who were sexually harassed or assaulted. It is also used to prevent revealing the identity of juveniles, and minors in matrimonial custody battles. SC has in many judgments asked all courts not to reveal the names of rape survivors in judgments.Justice Varma's plea - titled ""XXX vs Union of India"" - is the 699th civil writ petition filed in SC this year. While the Centre is the first respondent, SC itself is the second respondent. It was filed on July 17, and after the advocate on record rectified defects pointed out by the registry, SC registered the petition on July 24.Interestingly, while the petition ""XXX vs Union of India"" is listed at serial number 56 before the bench headed by Justice Datta, another petition by advocate Mathews J Nedumpara, seeking registration of FIR against Justice Varma to unravel the mystery behind the cash, its burning and subsequent disappearance, is listed at serial number 59 before the same bench on Monday.Meanwhile, Lok Sabha has admitted a notice for removal against Justice Varma signed by more than 150 MPs. The LS speaker is likely to write this week to CJI B R Gavai seeking names of an SC judge and an HC chief justice, who would be part of an inquiry committee under the Judges Inquiry Act, 1968.The speaker will nominate a distinguished jurist to complete the composition of the three-member committee headed by the SC judge. Repatriated to the Allahabad HC from the Delhi HC after the 'cash-in-kothi' controversy, Justice Varma in his petition has challenged the validity of the in-house inquiry report finding him guilty of the unaccounted cash at his residential premises and requested SC to declare the then CJI Sanjiv Khanna's May 8 recommendation to the President and the PM for his removal as unconstitutional.","Judge varma hides identity, is ‘xxx’ in his sc petition.

NEW DELHI: Accusing BJP of ""petty mindset"" and ""illegality"", Congress on Saturday said the government's decision to ignore the notice to remove Justice Yashwant Varma in Rajya Sabha in favour of the one submitted in Lok Sabha is dictated by its desire to control the narrative about the issue, stemming from its ""insecurity"" that the opposition had scored on corruption by moving first in the upper house. LS notice is bipartisan signed by 152 MPs, while the one in RS is exclusively signed by opposition members.Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi slammed the announcement by parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju , alleging it was now clear that former RS chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar's belated independent act on the Varma issue riled the Modi government and resulted in his ouster. With Rijiju saying that the RS had not ""admitted"" the notice, Singhvi said Dhankhar mentioned the notice in the House in detail on Monday talking about it meeting legal and numerical requirements, which was tantamount to admitting it. The Congress MP asked the government if RS should be giving long judgments like a judicial court to show ""admission"".Interestingly, Singhvi, a senior lawyer, alleged BJP MPs signed a blank paper in the room of defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday, which was likely an ""impeachment notice against Dhankhar"". He warned that the government may be committing a major violation by constituting the statutory committee to probe Varma exclusively on the LS notice.","Abhishek manu singhvi accuses bjp of ""petty mindset"" and ""illegality"" congress says the government's decision to ignore the notice to remove justice yashwant varma in rajya sabha is dictated by its desire to control the narrative about the issue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122941387,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-905370,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Uddhav-Raj bonhomie: Inside the Thackeray cousins' political reset before BMC polls - desperate photo-op or strategic comeback?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uddhav-raj-bonhomie-inside-the-thackeray-cousins-political-reset-before-bmc-polls-desperate-photo-op-or-strategic-comeback/articleshow/122934141.cms,"Awaj Marathicha: Estranged Thackeray Cousins Raj and Uddhav Reunite, Fadnavis Caught Off Guardraj

NEW DELHI: Is the much-hyped reunion of Thackeray cousins - Uddhav and Raj - a political masterstroke or a desperate move to survive in the changing Maharashtra landscape? Both Uddhav and Raj, who once enjoyed great political clout when Brand Thackeray was at its peak in state politics, are today struggling to stay relevant in an increasingly fragmented political space.While Uddhav, who lost the original party name and symbol to Eknath Shinde, has been marginalised after his party's drubbing in the last assembly elections, Raj Thackeray has failed to take off in the last two decades despite showing a lot of promise when he started under Balasaheb. In the last assembly elections, Raj could not ensure victory for his son Amit Thackeray who contested from Mahim contituency and lost to Shiv Sena (UBT) candidate Mahesh Sawant.In a symbolic gesture that adds fuel to the speculation, Raj Thackeray visited Uddhav Thackeray at his residence, Matoshree, on Sunday to extend birthday greetings. The visit came just weeks after the cousins shared the stage at the ‘Awaz Marathicha’ rally, signalling what many believe to be the beginning of a tentative political rapprochement.Also read - Hugs and roses: Raj Thackeray enters Matoshree after 13 years to greet Uddhav on birthday The immediate trigger for this new-found bonhomie between cousins is perhaps the BMC elections. The Shiv Sena has ruled the BMC for over two decades, consistently emerging as the single largest party since 2002. In the 2002 elections, the Sena won 97 seats and retained power with the BJP 's support.Though its tally dropped to 84 in 2007, it managed to hold on to the civic body. The 2012 results saw a further dip to 75 seats, but the party still remained on top, again with BJP’s backing. Even in 2017, despite a fierce contest and BJP closing the gap with 82 seats to Sena’s 84, the Shiv Sena maintained its grip on the country’s richest municipal corporation.However, ground realities have changed. BJP is now a very strong force in Maharashtra and Shiv Sena is under the control of Shinde. So, the upcoming elections will be a litmus test for the Thackerays to stay relevant in the politics of Mumbai.For Uddhav Thackeray, the stakes could not be higher. After losing the original Shiv Sena to Eknath Shinde’s rebellion in 2022 and rebranding under the Shiv Sena (UBT) banner, Uddhav has struggled to hold ground even in his stronghold, Mumbai. His shifting alliances -- from the BJP-led NDA to the Congress-NCP front -- yielded diminishing returns, both in the Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha elections. Now, by extending an olive branch to his cousin, he hopes to cobble together enough support to at least remain electorally viable, if not victorious.His faction’s poor performance in the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections and a weakened grassroots network have pushed him into a corner. The outreach to Raj Thackeray is being seen as a tactical, if not desperate, move to consolidate whatever remains of the Thackeray legacy.Uddhav’s troubles began with the political coup engineered by Shinde, who walked away with over 40 MLAs, aligning with the BJP and ultimately becoming Chief Minister. The episode cost Uddhav not only the CM post but also the party symbol and loyal cadre. Since then, Shinde’s portrayal of a humble, working-class leader with anti-dynasty credentials has further eroded Uddhav’s political base.Once the unchallenged force in Mumbai, Uddhav’s Shiv Sena (UBT) has struggled in recent elections, losing both political momentum and ground-level cadre support. His reunion with Raj is now being seen as a tactical, even desperate, move to consolidate what remains of the Thackeray brand in Maharashtra.Once hailed as Balasaheb Thackeray’s ideological heir, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief, who broke away from Shiv Sena in 2005 after being sidelined in favour of Uddhav, has remained on the political fringes for over a decade. His party failed to build on its early momentum, and even his son Amit Thackeray’s attempted electoral debut failed.Despite efforts to stay relevant -- including Amit’s debut and a potential alliance with the BJP -- Raj has struggled to rebuild MNS’s influence. A proposed tie-up with the BJP fizzled out ahead of the last assembly elections, further underlining the party’s weakening foothold.Now, Raj is doubling down on Balasaheb-style aggression. His recent rhetoric, including provocative lines like “dooba dooba ke maarenge” and warnings against Hindi imposition, appears aimed at reigniting Marathi pride. He has openly defended MNS workers accused of violence against non-Marathi speakers, reviving the polarising identity politics that once defined Mumbai in the 1990s. However, the city’s changing social and linguistic fabric has diluted the impact of such hardline positions.Initially, Raj’s firebrand oratory and Marathi-first politics resonated strongly with urban voters, especially in Mumbai, but the momentum waned as the city’s demographics and political priorities evolved. His repeated attempts to revive MNS’s base have yielded little success, and his political relevance has steadily declined.In this backdrop, Raj’s visible alignment with cousin Uddhav Thackeray though unofficial and likely temporary signals a strategic recalibration. While this association may not guarantee an electoral revival, it positions Raj back into the political conversation, particularly as the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections draw closer.The cousins’ joint appearance may be a trial balloon rather than a formal alliance. Still, in terms of political optics, it sends a powerful message -- especially at a time when Uddhav has been visibly warming up to BJP leader and CM Devendra Fadnavis. This has fuelled speculation about a possible re-entry into the NDA fold, potentially displacing Shinde from the leadership equation.At the other side, Eknath Shinde, once a loyalist of Balasaheb’s Shiv Sena, has leveraged his grassroots credentials and anti-dynastic pitch to climb the political ladder. However, Shinde’s position in the NDA has also weakened after Ajit Pawar joined the alliance, effectively diluting his bargaining power. While he continues to hold numbers in the assembly and Lok Sabha, the perception that he is no longer indispensable is growing.The upcoming BMC election will serve as a crucial barometer. A weak performance by Shinde’s faction could lead to a reshuffling within the NDA, where Uddhav’s re-entry might not be ruled out. Simultaneously, Raj’s visible alignment with Uddhav may not guarantee a revival but could at least reposition him as a political player -- and pave the way for his son Amit’s re-launch.Ultimately, whether the Thackeray cousins’ reunion is just an act of political theatre or the beginning of a serious strategic comeback remains to be seen. What is clear is that Maharashtra’s political equations are in flux, with legacy politics being tested by new power centres and shifting voter allegiances.The BMC election might just decide whether this family reunion becomes a new chapter or a brief photo-op in the twilight of their influence.",The much-hyped reunion of thackeray cousins - uddhav and raj - is a political masterstroke or a desperate move to survive in the changing maharashtra landscape. Both cousins are today struggling to stay relevant in an increasingly fragmented political space. The immediate trigger for this new-found bonhomie between cousins is perhaps the bmc elections.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122934383,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1284458,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday said India must focus on becoming powerful and economically strong, asserting that the world respects strength and not just ideals. Addressing a national education conference in Kochi, Bhagwat declared that India no longer has to be the “golden bird” of the past but must now transform into “a lion”.“It is necessary because the world understands power. So Bharat should become strong. It also has to become wealthy from an economic perspective,” Bhagwat said at the ‘Gyan Sabha’ organised by RSS-affiliated Shiksha Sanskriti Utthan Nyas.Emphasising national identity, Bhagwat said ""Bharat"" is a proper noun and should not be translated. “India is Bharat. That is true. But Bharat is Bharat. That is why, while talking, writing and speaking, be it personal or public, we should keep Bharat as Bharat,” he said.He stressed that a country's identity must be preserved for it to be respected. “The identity of Bharat is respected because it is Bharat. If you lose your identity, whatever other meritorious qualities you may have, you will never be respected or secure in this world. That is the thumb rule,” he said.The RSS chief also spoke at length about the purpose of education, saying it should equip individuals to live independently and contribute to society.“Bharatiya education teaches sacrifice and living for others,” he said, adding that anything which promotes selfishness cannot be called true education.Bhagwat further noted that education is not limited to schooling but also includes the environment at home and within society. He urged society to reflect on the kind of atmosphere needed to raise responsible and confident future generations.The conference was attended by Kerala governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar, academicians, and vice chancellors of various universities.",Rss chief mohan bhagwat said india must focus on becoming powerful and economically strong.

Poll Should there be stricter regulations for crowd control at religious events? Yes, absolutely No, it should remain as is

NEW DELHI: Mansa Devi temple authorities on Sunday dismissed reports of electrocution as the cause behind a stampede that killed six people and left over two dozen injured near the shrine in Haridwar.The chaos, which unfolded early Sunday morning, was reportedly triggered by a rumour of a snapped electric wire. However, officials said the tragedy occurred after a devotee slipped amid heavy crowding on the temple steps.Mahant Ravindra Puri, president of the Mansa Devi temple trust, said the tragedy was caused when a devotee slipped amid a surge of pilgrims approaching the shrine. “This is not an incident of electrocution, but there are no indications of such happening... We will assist the victim families... It happened as a huge crowd gathered here; the police were informed, barricades were put up, but still the crowd came up and someone slipped, due to which the entire incident took place,” Puri told ANI.The state disaster management Centre confirmed that five people suffered serious injuries, while 23 others received minor wounds in the stampede that occurred around 9 am.Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami visited the district hospital to meet the injured and announced compensation for the victims' families — Rs 2 lakh for the deceased and Rs 50,000 for the injured. “An unfortunate incident has taken place in which six people have died and many others have been injured in a stampede at the Mansa Devi temple due to a rumour... A magisterial inquiry has been ordered, the injured have been shifted to hospital and rescue operations are underway. .. Strict action will be taken against whoever is found guilty... All possible efforts are being made to help the injured,” Dhami said.AIIMS Rishikesh director Dr Meenu Singh said that four people are in critical condition after the stampede at Haridwar's Mansa Devi Temple on Sunday morning. She said that out of the 10 patients currently admitted to AIIMS Rishikesh, two were children.""The incident took place around 9 am, and patients started coming in around 11 am. So far, 15 patients have been brought here and 4-5 have been sent back because they sustained minor injuries. Out of the 10 patients admitted, two are children. Four are in a critical condition... Treatment of all the patients is underway...,"" Dr Singh told ANI.Earlier, Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami also met the injured and their families at AIIMS Rishikesh.A magisterial inquiry has been ordered, with Haridwar District Magistrate Mayur Dixit leading the investigation. “We found through photos and videos that someone spread the rumour that an electric wire had snapped. While looking at the injured or the dead, we did not get any such indication...We will investigate who spread the rumour,” Dixit said.Crowd management lapses are now under scrutiny. According to Mahant Puri, the Mansa Devi temple can be accessed by ropeway, vehicles, or an old walking route from Har Ki Pauri. Despite police barricades and alerts, the influx of pilgrims overwhelmed the arrangements.Minister Ganesh Joshi also visited the hospital and said, “14 seriously injured people have been referred to AIIMS Rishikesh and others are being treated at the district hospital. I have met them and they are fine... The government is providing full support to the victims...

It's a matter of happiness. Why should we view it politically? We also extend our best wishes to Uddhav ji. Going to wish someone on their birthday should not be seen through a political lens.

You will see it again in the upcoming local body elections,"" Fadnavis was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Weeks after joining hands to oppose the government’s move to introduce Hindi as a medium of instruction from Classes 1 to 5, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray on Sunday visited the house of Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray in Bandra East to wish him on his 65th birthday.In a warm display of camaraderie, Uddhav welcomed Raj with a heartfelt hug, while Raj presented his ""big brother"" with a bouquet of red roses. The visit marked Raj Thackeray's first entry into Matoshree since his departure from the Shiv Sena and the formation of the MNS in 2006.After the exchange of pleasantries, Raj and Uddhav held a private conversation lasting nearly 20 minutes. The visit is now being viewed as a significant step toward solidifying a potential MNS-Shiv Sena (UBT) alliance for the upcoming local body elections scheduled for November–December this year.Political observers note that the cousins meeting twice in less than a month strongly signals that a political reunion may follow the recent family thaw, likely to be formalised once the elections are officially announced.Sunday’s birthday meeting marked their second joint appearance after the July 5 rally opposing the imposition of Hindi in schools.",Devendra fadnavis dismisses political angle in raj thackeray's visit to uddhav's house.

BLOs found forging voters' signs: RJD

Poll What do you think is the most concerning issue regarding the electoral roll revisions in Bihar? Forged signatures Inclusion of deceased voters

Also read:

NEW DELHI: The special intensive revision of Bihar's electoral rolls was ""conducted in a manner that constitutes a grave fraud on voters"", petitioners opposing the Election Commission's exercise told Supreme Court on Saturday, alleging irregularities such as BLOs being found signing enumeration forms themselves, those dead being shown to have filled up forms, and those who hadn't filled up forms getting a message that their forms had been completed.Countering EC's submission that there was no irregularity in the process, Association for Democratic Reforms and Bihar's main opposition party, RJD, said in their responses that EC's figures were of no consequence since most of the forms were collected without documents and a large number of voters continued to be at the risk of disenfranchisement.Enumeration forms are being mass uploaded by BLOs without the knowledge or consent of voters, in order to achieve the unrealistic target set by EC. Many voters have reported that their forms have been submitted online, despite never having met with any BLO or signed any documents. Forms of even dead individuals have been reported to have been submitted,"" Association for Democratic Reforms said in its response filed through advocate Neha Rathi.It said, ""This points to the flawed manner in which the current SIR is being conducted, where the integrity of electoral rolls is compromised, potentially affecting millions of voters and undermining the democratic process.The situation raises serious questions about transparency, accountability and the potential for electoral fraud, as voters express confusion and concern over how their details were uploaded without their involvement. ""RJD MP Manoj Jha, in his response filed by advocate Fauzia Shakil, said media reports pointed out countless instances where electors have complained that BLOs did not visit their house or neighbourhood, forms were not given in duplicate, no acknowledgement was given on submission of forms and photos were not taken. He said BLOs were found forging voters' signatures on forms and uploading them.""The present exercise is unprecedented inasmuch as for the first time a person is being asked to furnish a documentary proof of his citizenship to the satisfaction of Election Commission to be enrolled as a voter and exercise his constitutional right to vote. As is evident from a bare perusal of Form 6 - the application form for a new voter - and documents for proof of date of birth and documents for proof of residence were required to be furnished along with only a declaration that a person is a citizen of India,"" Jha said.Pitting former EC commissioner against the poll panel, the petitioner referred to the opinion of Ashok Lavasa, who also questioned EC's decision on SIR. They also said there was no valid reason for EC to reject SC's suggestion to accept Aadhaar, voter ID and ration cards for inclusion in electoral rolls and that the exercise being done just months before the Bihar assembly polls was creating confusion on the ground and could disenfranchise lakhs of voters.""In light of the media reports from Bihar, showing how BLOs are signing blank enumeration forms in absence of voters, the numbers as suggested by EC are circumspect and even otherwise are of no consequence since most of these forms have been collected without documents and a large number of the electorate in Bihar continues to be at the risk of disenfranchisement. It is submitted that inclusion of name in draft roll has no meaning till documents as required are submitted, and thus, the risk of disenfranchisement looms large over a huge population who has already voted in multiple elections since 2003,"" the response said.","The special intensive revision of bihar's electoral rolls was ""conducted in a manner that constitutes a grave fraud on voters"", petitioners opposing the election commission's exercise told supreme court on saturday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122928625,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-153620,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Fertility scam busted: 8 held in baby-selling scam in Hyderabad; clinic run by mother-son duo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fertility-scam-busted-8-held-in-baby-selling-scam-in-hyderabad-clinic-run-by-mother-son-duo/articleshow/122937391.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: An illegal surrogacy and baby-selling racket operating out of a fertility clinic in Hyderabad was busted Sunday, leading to the arrest of eight individuals, including the clinic’s owner and fertility specialist, Dr A Namratha.A detailed investigation revealed that Namratha, 64, was running a large-scale scam through clinics located in Vijayawada, Secunderabad, Visakhapatnam, and Kondapur. She allegedly collected between Rs 20–30 lakh from each client under false pretenses, police said.Police further disclosed that Namratha’s son, an advocate by profession, managed the clinic’s financial operations from the same premises. He also reportedly intimidated clients who raised objections.Authorities, as cited by PTI, added that over 10 previous cases had been registered against the accused at various police stations across Andhra Pradesh. Despite the medical and health department cancelling the clinic’s registration earlier, it continued operations using the name of another certified doctor on official documents.The clinic at Gopalapuram in Hyderabad was sealed with assistance from the medical department.The racket resurfaced after a couple, who believed their child was born through surrogacy, discovered through a DNA test that the baby was not biologically theirs. Alarmed, the couple approached the police.Deputy Commissioner of Police (North Zone–Hyderabad) S Rashmi Perumal told PTI that Dr Namratha, along with her associates and agents, targeted vulnerable women—particularly those seeking abortions—and persuaded them to continue their pregnancies in exchange for money or other inducements. These newborns were then passed off as surrogate babies, misleading clients into believing they were their biological children.According to the police, the victim couple had approached Namratha’s clinic in August 2024 for fertility and IVF consultation. After initial tests, they were advised to opt for surrogacy. They were then referred to the clinic’s Visakhapatnam branch for specimen collection and were told the clinic would arrange a surrogate and handle the embryo transplant.Over the course of nine months, the couple made several payments totaling more than Rs 35 lakh. In June 2025, they were informed that a baby boy had been delivered via C-section in Visakhapatnam. The child was handed over to them along with documentation falsely listing them as the biological parents.""The baby was not shown as a child born to a surrogate, which drew their suspicion. Later, the couple went in for DNA test which revealed that the child’s DNA did not match theirs,"" said Rashmi.When the couple sought clarification from the clinic, they were denied documentation and threatened, prompting them to file a police complaint.In the current case, police traced the baby’s biological parents, originally from Assam and residing in Hyderabad, through agents. They had reportedly been paid a small amount after giving up the child. Both were arrested on charges of baby selling, and the infant has been handed over to 'Shishu Vihar' as per protocol.Dismissing certain media reports, Rashmi clarified, ""It is a case wherein the victim couple were told that they were going in for surrogacy, but in reality the baby was sold by the original parents and that the baby was shown to this complainant couple (by the accused) as their child. But when they did the DNA test it was revealed as not matching with theirs."" She also refuted claims that the child had cancer or that donor sperm had been used, reported PTI.The investigation remains underway, and additional legal action is being taken.","The racket resurfaced after a couple, who believed their child was born through surrogacy, discovered through a dna test that the baby was not biologically theirs.

Before 2014, most of my parliamentary career has been on the Opposition benches.

That is politics, but we are not enemies.""""There, one MP represents approximately 66,000 people. Here, it is over 20 lakh. They are not asked to fix drains or get someone out of jail.

Poll Do you agree with Tejashwi Yadav's claim that Chirag Paswan has a 'lust for power'? Yes, it's quite evident. No, that's a harsh judgment.

NEW DELHI: A day after Chirag Paswan showed his outrage against the law and order situation in Bihar, Independent MP Pappu Yadav on Sunday claimed that Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishore and the Union minister have joined hands for the upcoming assembly elections in the state.While talking to reporters, Purnia MP advised Kishore to declare Chirag as the chief ministerial face from his side.""Chirag ji and Prashant ji have become one. I feel that Prashant ji should have already declared Chirag ji as the chief minister,"" Pappu Yadav said.""Prashant Kishore is a troubled souled and only a person from Dalit or EBC community can become CM. And Chirag ji, there as well as here, how will things work like this? I would suggest leave that side and come here,"" he added.This comes after Chirag expressed anguish over the deteriorating law and order after a series of disturbing crimes in Bihar.""I feel ashamed that I am supporting a government where crime has become uncontrolled,"" Chirag said.""The way crime is happening in Bihar, the administration has totally bowed down in front of the criminals. It is correct that this incident required condemnation, but why such incidents are happening? There is a series of crimes.If it continues like this, the situation would be frightening, rather, it has become so,"" he added.Earlier, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav also took a swipe at Chirag Paswan, accusing him of having a ""lust for power"" and portraying himself powerless.""There’s complete criminal disorder; the concept of law and order has collapsed. Chirag Paswan is raising these issues, but he himself is part of the same government. He’s a powerful Union minister, and his party has 5 MPs. Then why is he acting so helpless?"" Tejashwi asked.""On one hand, he is criticising his own government, and on the other, he’s portraying himself as powerless. If you really believe crime has surged in Bihar, if rapes are happening, if corruption is rampant—then why are you still in that alliance? Because you love your position. You’ve become so weak that despite being in power, you’re unable to act,"" he added.Meanwhile, Chirag's remarks have triggered sharp reactions from alliance partners, while the BJP has chosen to remain silent.Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) leader and Union Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi responded swiftly, branding Chirag Paswan as ""politically immature"".“Chirag’s politics is still in its infancy. His father, Ram Vilas Paswan, had a towering political stature. Chirag lacks experience and is speaking without full knowledge,” Manjhi said.He further countered Chirag Paswan’s claims on law and order, asserting that the current situation is far better than pre-2005 Bihar.“At that time, criminals could walk into the CM’s residence with impunity. Negotiations over kidnapping were taking place from the CM residence before 2005. Today, there is accountability.

BATHINDA: Resistance to AAP-led Punjab government's land-pooling policy is acting as the glue to bring together fractured farm organisations and individual farmers beyond political affiliation, reports Neel Kamal.It appears to be rekindling farm struggles that seemed to be losing momentum - seeing that there was not much hue and cry after Punjab Police slammed shut the protests at Shambhu and Khanauri borders with Haryana.The Bhagwant Mann government has been trying to convince people that land-pooling scheme was beneficial to farmers but it hasn't been able to dispel farmers' apprehension of losing land. Individual farmers from villages where land is being 'pooled' - those so far not associated with farm organisations - are now turning towards them to oppose the scheme.The policy aims to pool over 40,000 acres of farmland to promote planned urban development. It's a land-for-land scheme, where landowners voluntarily give up land and are given developed residential and commercial plots in exchange.SKM's green light to its Punjab chapter to hold tractor rallies on July 30 in villages that are likely to be brought under land-pooling scheme has come as a boost to forces opposing the scheme.
