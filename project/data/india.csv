"After 75 years of statute, law enforcers ignorant of rights, or don’t care: SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-75-years-of-statute-law-enforcers-ignorant-of-rights-or-dont-care-sc/articleshow/119682800.cms,"New Delhi: The poem posted online by Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi preached non-violence and love and there was nothing objectionable to initiate criminal proceedings against him, SCsaid on Friday.“No prima facie case can be said to have been made out against the appellant qua the sections invoked. In such a case, registration of the FIR appears to be a very mechanical exercise and is a clear abuse of the process of law. In fact, registration of such FIR virtually borders on perversity,” Justice Abhay S Oka, who penned the verdict for the bench, said.“The poem’s words do not bring about or promote disharmony or feelings of hatred or ill-will. It only seeks to challenge the injustice made by the ruler. It is impossible to say that the words used by the appellant disturb or are likely to disturb public tranquillity. It is ridiculous to say that the act of the appellant is intended to outrage the religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs. The poem only tells the rulers what the reaction will be if the fight for rights is met with injustice,” the bench said.Setting standards for assessing the impact of spoken and written words, the bench said, “When an offence punishable under Section 196 of BNS is alleged, the effect of the spoken or written words will have to be considered based on standards of reasonable, firm and courageous individuals and not based on the standards of people with weak and oscillating minds. The effect of the spoken or written words cannot be judged on the basis of the standards of people who always have a sense of insecurity or of those who always perceive criticism as a threat to their power or position.”It added, “On Jan 26, 2025, our Constitution became 75 years old. One of the important fundamental rights conferred on the citizens of India is under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. It is the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression . This case shows that even after 75 years of the existence of our Constitution, the law enforcement machinery of state is either ignorant about this important fundamental right or does not care for this fundamental right.”","The poem posted online by congress mp imran pratapgarhi preached non-violence and love. “no prima facie case can be said to have been made out against the appellant qua the sections invoked.

Accurate circle rates key to good governance: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/accurate-circle-rates-key-to-good-governance-sc/articleshow/119682581.cms,"New Delhi: Supreme Court has ruled that fixation of accurate circle rates , the minimum value of land and properties in a locality, is a prerequisite of good governance and will help enhance ease of living and doing business, but lamented that this important aspect has escaped “adequate attention” of govts.Circle rates notified by govts determine the stamp duty to be paid by purchasers of land and properties in a locality, and helps the land acquisition officer quantify the fair compensation to be paid to landowners.A bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar, while rejecting an appeal by Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation , said, “While serving the interests of honest taxpayers, accurate circle rates would simultaneously deter non-compliant taxpayers by preventing under-valuation.”In the judgment, the CJI stated, “Rational and fair circle rates are essential for good governance. Since the fixation of circle rates affects everyone financially, the data and methods used to determine them should be made public. Unfortunately, this important aspect has not received sufficient attention from authorities.”“An inflated rate results in an unfair financial burden on purchasers. Conversely, an undervalued rate leads to inadequate stamp duty collection, adversely affecting the State’s revenue.

“Aankh chheen kar chasma daine vale log, rakh lo apne pass yeh Saugat-e-Modi' kit”

NEW DELHI: Iftar diplomacy , an annual ritual in Bihar, has become an important platform for political outreach this year as the state gears up for assembly elections amid the row over Centre's proposed Waqf Amendment Bill . The politics over the Bill has already taken centrestage in the poll-bound state with the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) launching its mega all-India protest earlier this week from Patna.Chief minister Nitish Kumar and Union minister Chirag Paswan, who are key allies of the BJP, face immense pressure from Muslim organisations to oppose the Bill. Their get-togethers this year were boycotted by some of these organisations as a mark of protest adding an interesting challenge to their iftar diplomacy.On the last Friday of Ramzan, a large number of Muslims in Patna wore black armbands during Jummah prayers to register their protest against the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, following an appeal by the AIMPLB.Nitish Kumar, who is yet to make a statement on the Bill, has been consistently attending iftar parties to showcase his commitment to the community. On Friday, he attended an iftar party organised at Haj Bhawan in Patna. Despite the enthusiasm at Haj Bhawan, where attendees raised slogans of ‘2025 again CM Nitish Kumar’, the chief minister refrained from interacting with the media and left the venue shortly after meeting the community leaders.Nitish, who faces a catch-22 situation over the issue, would hope that BJP's ""Saugat-e-Modi"" campaign, launched to reach out to the Muslims, counters some of this anger and creates a division within the community.The ""Saugat-e-Modi"" campaign, launched by the BJP Minority Morcha aims to distribute special kits to 32 lakh underprivileged Muslims across the country ahead of Eid so that they can celebrate the festival without any hardship.The kits distributed under the ""Saugat-e-Modi"" campaign will contain a variety of items. Along with food items, the kits will include clothes, vermicelli, dates, dry fruits, and sugar. Women's kits will contain fabric for suits, while men's kits will include kurta-pyjamas.On the other hand, Nitish Kumar's arch rival Lalu Prasad and other opposition parties in the state are going all out to make the most of this anger within the Muslims. An ailing Lalu joined the AIMPLB protest in Patna along with his son Tejashwi, who is leading the charge against the ruling NDA in Bihar. Addressing the protesters, Tejashwi assured them that his party and its leader, Lalu Yadav, firmly stand with them in their fight against the ""unconstitutional"" Waqf (Amendment) Bill.The RJD also took a dig at the BJP by putting up posters condemning the saffron party's ‘Saugat-e-Modi' kits to Muslims while trying to pass the Waqf (Amendment) Bill.The posters criticised the BJP-led NDA government over the Waqf (Amendment) Bill and read:(Those who take away eyesight and offer glasses, keep this gift to yourselves).They featured a caricature of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with four hands, each holding labels such as Waqf Bill, NRC and Masjid, among other things.Images of other NDA leaders, including Union minister Chirag Paswan and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, with Waqf Board and NRC written on their hands, respectively, also found place in the posters.The text on the poster read, “Take back the Waqf (Amendment) Bill if you truly want to offer a gift of love. If you wish to distribute something on Eid, spread love—not division. But we know this isn't possible because your (NDA's) shop of hatred will shut down.”The RJD top brass has been actively participating and organising iftar parties to consolidate the party's support among the community in the election year. For now, while the NDA allies, have used the Iftar parties to send across a message of unity among the partners, the state Congress leadership added a twist to opposition tale by giving the RJD iftar party a miss.Elections in the state are still 6 to 7 months away and it will be interesting to see whose Eid outreach translates into votes.",Bjp's 'saugat-e-modi' vs opposition's iftar: who wins bihar?

The comedian stated that he had moved from Mumbai to Tamil Nadu in 2021 and has been ""ordinarily a resident of this State since then"".Kamra, 36, has been summoned twice by Mumbai Police after his remarks.The stand-up special, titled "" Naya Bharat ,"" was filmed at Mumbai’s Habitat Studio and released on Sunday. The video sparked outrage among Shiv Sena workers, leading to vandalism at the venue and threats against Kamra.In the performance, Kamra parodied a popular song from Dil Toh Pagal Hai , referring to Shinde as a ""gaddar"" (traitor). His sharp political satire also touched on Maharashtra’s recent political upheaval, including rifts within the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Other figures he targeted included Prime Minister Narendra Modi and businessman Mukesh Ambani.Despite mounting backlash, Kamra refused to back down. ""I will not apologise,"" he posted on X, criticising both the ""mob and politicians"" angered by his jokes.Later that evening, an FIR was lodged against him over the video for remarks on Shinde.","Kunal kamra was granted interim anticipatory bail till april 7 by the madras high court.

"No FIR without CJI’s nod, says Amit Shah on Justice Varma case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-fir-without-cjis-nod-says-amit-shah-on-justice-varma-case/articleshow/119676385.cms,"NEW DELHI: In the Centre’s first public response to the alleged recovery of cash from the official bungalow of Justice Yashwant Varma, home minister Amit Shah on Friday said no FIR could have been registered in the matter without a go-ahead from the Chief Justice of India (CJI).“When no FIR can be registered, how can a seizure be carried out. The FIR can only be registered with the CJI’s permission,” Shah said at the Times Now Summit 2025, co-presented by Dream Sports and powered by Pernod Ricard India. He also said a panel of judges was looking into the matter and one should wait for its report.The home minister touched upon several other issues including the Waqf Bill, declaring that govt would bring the bill before Parliament in the ongoing session, notwithstanding the protests by Muslim clerics, Islamic outfits and opposition parties. “(Then) Congress govt had passed the Waqf Bill in 2013 without any debate to appease a votebank. It is against the spirit of the Constitution. We are only trying to bring it in line with the Constitution,” Shah said.“The current law says Waqf Board decisions cannot be challenged in court. How can this be allowed? Even decisions of the govt are challenged in court,” he said while accusing opposition parties of misleading the Muslim community “simply to consolidate a votebank”.Earlier, while speaking on the alleged recovery of cash at Justice Varma’s residence, Shah said CJI Sanjiv Khanna had, in line with the procedure outlined in a Supreme Court verdict, taken note of the matter and set up a committee of judges to hold an inquiry. “Delhi Police and fire brigade are providing whatever documents are sought by the committee. They are cooperating with the inquiry,” he added. “The committee of judges will take a call in the matter and place its decision in the public domain. We should wait for the committee’s report,” the minister said.Shah declined comment on the transfer of Justice Varma, saying it was the domain of the SC collegium. Touching upon the demand for caste census, Shah recalled that the idea of a caste census was rejected by all Congress govts prior to 2011. “A socio-economic caste census was conducted in 2011 but they did nothing with it as it returned 48 lakh castes. Now, we are using technology to explore all possibilities and ways to correctly capture caste and sub-castes. As and when we take a decision on the census procedures, we will make it public,” he said.On delimitation, Shah reiterated the assurance that “no one will have to suffer even 0.001% injustice”. “This is the BJP govt’s policy,” he assured even as he questioned the timing of DMK and other parties raising the delimitation bogey when the govt had not announced any move to take up delimitation or notified its procedure. “DMK is trying to bring up issues like language and delimitation, anticipating defeat in the Tamil Nadu polls next year due to the corruption and chaos its govt has brought about in the state,” he said. On leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi’s grievance that he was not being allowed to speak in Parliament, Shah said he has ample opportunity to speak as Congress gets nearly 40% of the time allotted for all parliamentary debates. “He wants to speak during other members’ time. This may be OK in party office but not in Parliament that runs as per rules. As LoP, he should show respect for rules of Parliament and speak during his party’s time in debates,” he said.On Manipur, Shah said ethnic conflicts had been happening in the past too, sometimes lasting 3-4 years. “There is peace in Manipur for the past 7 months... Talks are being held with both communities. One round was held by MHA and another is expected soon,” he said.Ahead of PM Modi’s visit to RSS headquarters in Nagpur, Shah praised the organisation for training crore of Indians in taking decisions and working while keeping patriotism and nationalism paramount.","Home minister amit shah said no fir could have been registered in the matter without a go-ahead from the chief justice of india (cji) “when no fir can be registered, how can a seizure be carried out?

"Mega Rs 62,700 crore deal for 'Prachand' attack choppers inked after CCS nod",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mega-rs-62700-crore-deal-for-prachand-attack-choppers-inked-after-ccs-nod/articleshow/119664746.cms,"Light combat helicopters

NEW DELHI: India on Friday inked the mega Rs 62,700 crore contract to acquire 156 indigenous `Prachand’ light combat helicopters (LCHs) for its armed forces from Hindustan Aeronautics ( HAL ), in the biggest-ever such deal that was signed soon after it got the final nod from the PM-led cabinet committee on security.The CCS approved the procurement of 90 LCHs for the Army and 66 for IAF, which are armed with 20mm turret guns, 70mm rocket systems and air-to-air missiles for offensive operations and precision-strikes in high-altitude areas like eastern Ladakh and Siachen Glacier on the borders with China and Pakistan.The 156 LCHs, along with associated equipment and training for Rs 62,700 crore, excluding taxes, will add to the 15 such choppers (10 IAF and 5 Army) already inducted under a Rs 3,887 crore contract in 2022. “Prachand is a powerful machine. This decision marks a major boost to India’s combat capabilities and self-reliance in defence ,” defence minister Rajnath Singh said.The CCS, incidentally, also approved the new defence cooperation agreement with Sri Lanka, ahead of PM Modi’s visit to the island nation next week.TOI was the first to report that the deals for the 156 LCHs and 307 indigenous advanced towed artillery systems with gun-towing vehicles (Rs 6,900 crore) would be cleared by the CCS and inked before this fiscal ends on March 31.The deals for the direct acquisition of 26 Rafale-Marine fighters from France as well as the construction of three additional Scorpene submarines at Mazagon Docks, collectively worth almost Rs 1 lakh crore (Euro 10.6 billion), however, have been deferred to be the next fiscal now.As per the contracts inked in presence of defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, the 156 LCHs will be built at HAL helicopter factories in Bengaluru and Tumkur in Karnataka. “The deliveries will begin in three years, with 30 LCHs to be manufactured per year,” an official told TOI.“LCH is India’s first indigenously designed and developed combat helicopter capable of operating at an altitude of over 5,000 meters (16,400-feet) with a considerable load of weapons and fuel,” he said.The highly-agile and manoeuvrable 5.8-tonne Prachand has 45% indigenous content by value at present. “The plan is to achieve an overall indigenous content of over 65% during the execution of this 156-LCH procurement,” he added.Separately, the MoD also signed a contract with US company Metrea Management for “wet leasing” of one KC-135 mid-air refuelling aircraft, which will come within six months, for providing training to IAF and Navy pilotsThe total number of contracts signed by the MoD during the 2024-25 fiscal has now reached 193, with the overall value crossing Rs 2 lakh crore. “This is the highest ever such figure, and nearly double the previous such number. Of them, the contracts to domestic industry are 177 (92%), with a value of almost Rs 1.7 lakh crore (81%),” another official said.Powered by two Shakti engines developed with the French Safran Group, the Prachand can take on enemy infantry troops, tanks, bunkers and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles). The need for such helicopters for mountain warfare was first acutely felt during the 1999 Kargil conflict with Pakistan.The chopper also has “enhanced survivability” through light-weight armour panels against 7.62mm and 12.7mm rounds, self-sealing fuel tanks, damage-tolerant main rotor blades, bullet-proof windshields and a low frontal radar cross-section.","India on friday inked the mega rs 62,700 crore contract to acquire 156 indigenous `prachand’ light combat helicopters (lchs) for its armed forces.

NEW DELHI: The Gujarat High Court on Friday extended self-proclaimed godman Asaram Bapu’s temporary bail by three months in a rape case, citing medical reasons. The 86-year-old, who is serving a life sentence in Jodhpur Central Jail , has been granted relief to seek treatment for his heart ailments and other age-related health issues.Asaram was previously granted interim bail by the Supreme Court until March 31, 2025, also on medical grounds. With the new order, his temporary release has now been extended further.The Supreme Court, while granting interim bail in January, prohibited Asaram from meeting his followers post-release. His legal team had approached the apex court after the Gujarat high court had rejected his bail plea in August 2024, citing the seriousness of the crime.The SC, however, considered only the medical grounds, leading to his temporary release.Asaram was convicted in 2023 by a Gandhinagar court for raping a woman who lived at his ashram in Gujarat. He is also serving life imprisonment for sexually assaulting a minor in 2013 at his Jodhpur ashram.Following the Supreme Court’s initial bail order in January, security around the rape survivor’s family was significantly increased.Earlier, he was granted a seven-day parole in 2018, later extended by five days.He also received a 17-day parole in December 2024 before obtaining his interim bail in January 2025.Asaram was first arrested in 2013 after a minor girl from Shahjahanpur accused him of sexual assault at his Jodhpur ashram. Convicted in 2018, he was sentenced to life imprisonment under the POCSO Act.

Al-Quds is Arabic for Jerusalem.Kashmiri protesters carrying banners that read “Free Palestine” marched through the busy markets of Srinagar, Budgam, and other districts. The demonstrators, including women and children, called for an end to Israeli “occupation of Palestinian territories”.Every year on Al-Quds Day, officially known as International Quds Day , Kashmir witnesses protests in support of Palestinians. It is an annual pro-Palestinian event held on the last Friday of the Islamic month of Ramadan. Many speakers said that Kashmir stands in solidarity with the “oppressed people of Palestine”.A police statement said a case has been registered against the organisers and participants of a Youm-e-Quds procession in Beerwah, Budgam, “for creating a law and order situation by raising objectionable slogans”.“By sloganeering, organisers tried to create a law and order situation, thereby causing obstruction to smooth movement of the general public,” police said. Police have registered a case under various BNS sections.In the north Kashmir district of Baramulla police registered a case under UAPA against people involved for what it said amounted to “promoting terrorism by displaying Hezbollah flags and raising slogans in support of the militant group”. J&K police lodged an FIR at police station Pattan against a group of people seen carrying Hezbollah flags, placards, and banners featuring photographs of the Hezbollah commander.“The individuals were also heard raising slogans in support of Hezbollah with the intent to incite the general public and encourage elements associated with terrorist organisations to engage in subversive activities and to revive terrorist activities within the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir,” police said.“Police have initiated their investigation into the matter and swift action is assured against those found involved in activities that threaten peace and stability in the region,” police said.","Kashmiri protesters carrying banners that read ‘free palestine’ marched through the busy markets of srinagar, budgam, and other districts.

'National leadership will decide': Annamalai on BJP-AIADMK alliance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/national-leadership-will-decide-annamalai-on-bjp-aiadmk-alliance-ahead-of-tamil-nadu-assembly-elections/articleshow/119663716.cms,"K Annamalai (ANI file photo)

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai on Friday said that the party's central leadership will take an ""appropriate call"" on the shape and form of alliances for the 2026 assembly elections, aiming to unseat MK Stalin's ruling DMK.His remarks come amid speculation about a possible revival of the BJP-AIADMK alliance after AIADMK general secretary and former Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami met Union home minister Amit Shah earlier this week.Asked about the AIADMK returning to the NDA, Annamalai said, ""I am not authorised to talk about alliance or the formation of alliance at this point of time.""""As the president of Tamil Nadu BJP, the role that is given to me is to strengthen the party in the state. That is what all of us are trying to do. The leaders are with me, the cadres are with me,"" he added.He said that ""with respect to the shape and form of the alliance in 2026 and the nature of the NDA, our leadership will take a call at an appropriate time and naturally the media will be briefed.""Speaking after a meeting with Union minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh, Annamalai described the 2026 elections as an opportunity to dethrone the DMK, citing corruption allegations and a ""deteriorating law and order situation"" in the state.""The DMK should be brought down from power and no vote should get wasted by the votes getting shifted between different parties. Tamil Nadu, as of now, has a five-cornered contest. Nowhere else in the Indian politics you see a five-cornered contest ,"" he said.He reiterated that alliance decisions rest with BJP's national leadership. ""With respect to the alliance, you have to understand that for a national party like the BJP, a disciplined party, it is our national leadership that will decide. So, we have committees, we have parliamentary boards which look into a lot of angles before they make the decision.""""We respect our national leadership and they will make sure and look into everything. They will decide how the further course will go,"" he added.On actor-turned-politician Vijay’s recent criticism of both the BJP and DMK, Annamalai dismissed it as ""politics of speaking"" rather than action.""Very sadly, Mr Vijay has decided to do politics of speaking: just take a mike, criticise the Central government and the state government, and get away with it,"" he said.""People are asking what is the productive solution you are going to bring. Are you solving the issues... Today he talked about the fishermen issue. We are solving the fishermen issue. The BJP is working very hard to solve the fishermen issue,"" he added.","Tamil nadu bjp chief k annamalai says party's central leadership will take an ""appropriate call"" on the shape and form of alliances for the 2026 assembly elections.

NEW DELHI: The bodies of three Jammu and Kashmir policemen killed in an encounter with Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists were recovery on Friday, as the gunfight in Jammu's Kathua district stretched into its second day.The fourth policeman's body was located in the morning, but retrieval efforts were delayed as two terrorists continued firing from an elevated position.The encounter began on Thursday in Jakhole village, Ghati Juthana area, after security forces launched an operation against recently infiltrated terrorists from across the International Border. So far, four policemen and three terrorists have been killed, while seven security personnel, including a deputy superintendent of police (DSP), have been injured.Heavy gunfire and explosions continued as police, the Army, and CRPF advanced through difficult terrain. It is unclear if these terrorists were part of a group that earlier escaped a security cordon in Hiranagar’s Sanyal forest or a separate infiltration.The bodies of the policemen—Balwinder Singh Chib, Jaswant Singh, and Tariq Ahmed—were recovered after a day of search efforts. Their service weapons were missing, but officials have not confirmed whether the terrorists took them.Director General of Police (DGP) Nalin Prabhat received the bodies at the medical college before a ceremonial tribute at district police lines in Kathua.The officers had been protecting the SDPO leading the search party when they were ambushed. The SDPO was later evacuated in an injured state. Three other policemen and two Army personnel are also hospitalised but stable.Earlier, a group of terrorists was spotted in Sanyal village near the International Border. Security forces launched a massive search operation using advanced surveillance tools, but the terrorists managed to escape and later resurfaced near Jakhole, about 30 km away. Search teams later found weapons, grenades, bulletproof vests, and bomb-making materials near the original encounter site.Reinforcements from the police, Army, and CRPF were sent to the area, while special forces were airdropped to hunt down the terrorists. Security officials believe the terrorists infiltrated last Saturday, possibly through a ravine or a newly built tunnel.The People's Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF), a front for Jaish-e-Mohammed, has claimed responsibility for the attack.Jammu police officials have been overseeing operations in Kathua for the past four days. The Army’s Rising Star Corps paid tribute to the fallen officers, saying on X: ""Rising Star Corps salutes the valour and indomitable spirit of the brave (J-K) Police personnel who made the supreme sacrifice fighting valiantly during the ongoing OP Safiyan in Kathua. Their courage and dedication will always be remembered.""","The bodies of three jammu and kashmir policemen killed in an encounter with jaish-e-mohammed terrorists were recovery on friday.

I was sitting in the lobby of a hotel, waiting to attend a session, with an hour to spare. The hotel was abuzz with preparations for a reunion—a gathering of men in their fifties, likely former classmates. As the guests started to arrive, loud cheers and animated conversations filled the air; they seemed engulfed in waves of nostalgia.There is something both heartwarming and melancholic about reunions. Heartwarming because time had softened old rivalries, leaving only camaraderie. Melancholic because life had played its capricious hand—those once dismissed as failures now shone like stars, while the once-envied prodigies had faded into anonymity.When we were children, sitting side by side at wooden desks, the world felt fair and equal. Our uniforms were the same, we shared our lunches and endured punishments together. Laughter rolled freely, tears were wiped away. And we dreamed the same dreams.With the naïve confidence of youth, we believed that life would be just and effort always equalled success.But life is an unusual classroom. Unlike school , where lessons precede tests, life tests us first and teaches us later. It is a mischievous storyteller, delighting in unexpected plot twists.The girl who once thundered on debate stages now hesitates to voice her opinion at home. The quiet one, whom nobody noticed, is now a celebrated bureaucrat.And we ask ourselves:I was reminded of a verse by Na Muthukumar, one of modern Tamil literature’s finest poets, titled ‘Nobody told us that life does not follow the predictable equations of the classroom. That intelligence matters but timing matters more. That hard work is invaluable, but networking often determines success. Sometimes, we land on a square where a ladder lifts us higher; at other times, we find ourselves at the mouth of a snake that drags us down into unseen depths.Thiruvalluvar smiles at us from across centuries, reminding us that the world has its own intricate balance—one we may never fully grasp:Who are we, but mere travellers in this vast, unknowable design of creation?As I was summoned to my meeting, I took one last glance at the old friends in the lobby. Time had aged them, but their laughter remained untouched.The brief reunion returned them to the warm womb of the classroom—where there were no disparities, only shared dreams.“Thank God for small mercies,” I whispered to myself and walked away.","Thirukkural is considered one of the great works on ethics and morality.

But there were other elements who did not want a resolution of the issues. We know this as we are aware of the ground situation and do not live in ivory towers.”Regarding the demands of farmers, SC said it would consider requesting Centre to find measures to address their grievances after Punjab govt files a fresh report on the situation.
