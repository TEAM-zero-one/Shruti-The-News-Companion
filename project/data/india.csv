NEW DELHI: Indian Youth Congress president Uday Bhanu Chib was granted bail on Saturday after he was arrested in connection to shirtless protest at Bharat Mandapam during the AI summit.Advocate Sulaiman Mohammad Khan said that a Duty Magistrate granted bail to Chib after Delhi Crime Branch was unable to produce any solid reasons to seek the police custody of the IYC National President.""We have also moved an application praying for the grant of bail to the National President, Uday Bhanu Chib.

We pass sweeping orders without realising impact on the ground: CJI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-pass-sweeping-orders-without-realising-impact-on-the-ground-cji/articleshow/128870985.cms,"‘Justice Delayed Is Justice Destroyed’: CJI Kant Calls High Courts Key Guardians Of Citizens’ Rights

If police can’t verify complaint before FIR, who else will: SC

NEW DELHI: In an unusual introspective remark, Chief Justice Surya Kant-led bench of the Supreme Court on Friday said on several occasions the apex court passes sweeping orders unmindful of India’s social ground realities and without understanding their adverse impact on the social fabric.When a bunch of petitions challenging the validity of the sedition provision in BNS and a provision in BNSS allowing police to conduct preliminary inquiry prior to registration of FIR came up for hearing, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy said permitting police to conduct preliminary inquiry prior to registration of FIR was in violation of SC ruling in the 2014 Lalita Kumari judgment.The SC in the 2014 judgment had ruled that if a complaint disclosed a cognizable offence, then the police must immediately register an FIR but can conduct preliminary inquiry into such complaints relating to matrimonial disputes, medical negligence and some other categories of cases.CJI Kant said, to test the validity of provisions of any new law, one must wait for a few years to observe its working and on finding lacunae; the same could be challenged. “Do you know how Lalita Kumari ruling is abused by filing frivolous cases for registration of FIRs? How judicial forums are abused,” he asked.The CJI said, “In some cases, we pass sweeping orders as if sitting in ivory towers and without realising the social realities in the country.Frivolous complaints lodged in the heat of the moment in rural areas, when converted to FIRs, have the potential of causing deep animosity in society.”Justice Kant said, “We pass sweeping orders in the name of protecting fundamental rights which in reality disturb the social fabric.” Guruswamy said how can the police have the power to determine the veracity of a complaint at the time of registration of FIR to argue that police can do so after registering the FIR.The bench said, “If police can’t determine the veracity of the complaint prior to converting it into an FIR, who else will?” Justice Bagchi said, “Lalita Kumar judgment gives the power of preliminary inquiry power to police in several categories of cases, including matrimonial disputes. Legislature has reflected this aspect in the law with respect to the degree of punishment provided for the offences. Such a provision cannot be at the teeth of Lalita Kumari judgment. ”Guruswamy argued that the sedition provision was incorporated in BNS despite Union govt undertaking before the SC not to do it. SC said, “Union govt can give such an undertaking. But Parliament is not bound by it. Parliament has the exclusive power to enact legislation. While testing its validity, SC can interpret and read it down.” It posted the petitions for a detailed hearing in March second week.","Cji kant said, to test the validity of provisions of any new law, one must wait for a few years to observe its working and on finding lacunae. “do you know how lalita kumari ruling is abused by filing frivolous cases for registration of firs?

A stuffed orangutan and shared grief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-stuffed-orangutan-and-shared-grief/articleshow/128851647.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. Recently, the internet found a new child to weep for — a seven-month-old baby macaque named Punch, who lives in the Ichikawa city zoo in Japan. Abandoned by his parents at birth and rejected by his clan, zookeepers gave him a stuffed orangutan toy for comfort. Punch clutched it instantly and carried it everywhere, running to it whenever threatened. Not long ago, a similar wave of emotion spread across the world for another solitary animal — the penguin that wandered away. Now it is Punch’s turn. Visitors flock to see him; strangers from abroad send identical plush toys in case his toy wears out. But the tears shed for him go beyond a love for animals. People see themselves in the tiny creature, their own histories of rejection, humiliation, subtle bullying by dominant members, exclusion for being different in appearance, caste, creed, accent or gender. The new employee who eats lunch alone after others leave, for example, the daughter-in-law entering an established household, the migrant, the misfit, the outsider who hears, in countless small ways, “you don’t belong here”. I remember such an exile of my own. When I changed schools in Class IX, I left behind the comfort of familiar friends. The new class felt closed against me. Mornings were heavy with dread. It took an academic breakthrough — outdoing established toppers in the first examination — to gain acceptance. Friendships eventually formed; warmth returned. Yet, decades later, the chill remains vivid. Watching Punch flee to his toy, I recognise that search for something that will not reject us when the social world turns cold. Vaishnavite tradition offers a telling metaphor: markata nyayam and marjala nyayam. The baby monkey clings to its mother; the kitten is carried by the mother cat. The devotee may hold to the divine, or the divine may hold the devotee. Punch lost, or was denied, that primal grip. His plushie became the body he could hold. Zoo authorities call the clan’s behaviour normal. In primate hierarchies, difference is rarely tolerated at first. They expect that, in time, Punch will learn to cope and find his place. Perhaps one day he will no longer need the toy. We have seen that moment in our own homes: the doll we once clutched in sleep, the blanket dragged everywhere. Then, quietly, we stopped asking for it. The toy remains in a cupboard, then a box, then — during house cleaning — is given away. Parents pause, holding it, feeling the ache of abandonment which comes with growth. So too with Punch. There will likely come a day when the orange companion is no longer his world. But today, it is his lifeline. And in that image lies something universal: every life form needs something — or someone — to cling to. Attachment is not weakness; it is the root of survival. Whether it is a mother’s body, a friend’s presence, a belief, a memory, or even a toy, love is the sustaining grip that keeps existence from falling into emptiness. Thiruvalluvar saw this with piercing clarity. In Kural 78, he wrote: Anbagathu Illaa Uyirvaazhkkai Vanpaarkkan Vatral Maramthalirth Thatru A life without love to hold it, is like a withered tree struggling in wilderness To sprout in arid ground Punch clings to an orange toy. We cling to less visible forms of love. The gesture is the same — and it is what keeps us all alive.","Thirukkural with the times explores real-world lessons from the classic tamil text.

Why Delhi court discharged Kejriwal , Sisodia?

What is the case about?

NEW DELHI: A Rouse Avenue Court on Friday discharged former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal , former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and 21 others in the Delhi excise policy case, refusing to take cognisance of the CBI ’s chargesheet.The order was delivered by Special Judge (PC Act) Jitender Singh of the Rouse Avenue Court.The Delhi court held that there was ""no cogent"" evidence against Kejriwal and ""no prima facie"" case against Sisodia or the other accused. The court pulled up the CBI by saying ""there was no overarching conspiracy or criminal intent in the excise policy,"" PTI reported quoting the judge as saying.It observed that the ""voluminous"" chargesheet filed by the agency contained several lacunae and was not corroborated by evidence or witness testimony.""... The chargesheet suffers from internal contradictions, striking at the root of conspiracy theory,"" PTI reported quoting the judge.The court noted that in the absence of evidence, the allegations against Kejriwal could not be sustained and that the former chief minister had been implicated without any cogent material.The order stated that the allegations ""failed judicial scrutiny"" and found ""no criminal intent"" on the part of Manish Sisodia.It added that the conspiracy theory ""cannot survive against one constitutional authority.""The court also strongly criticised the investigative approach adopted by the CBI, particularly its reliance on approver statements. It observed that granting pardon to an accused, turning him into an approver, and then using his statements to fill gaps in the investigation or rope in additional accused persons was improper.""If such conduct is allowed, it would be a grave violation of the Constitutional principles. The conduct where an accused is granted pardon and then made an approver, his statements used to fill the gaps in the investigation/narrative and make additional people accused is wrong,"" the court said.According to the court, the prosecution's theory was based on ""conjecture rather than concrete evidence"" and failed to withstand judicial scrutiny. The judge concluded that no prima facie case was made out against any of the 23 accused and ordered their discharge.The court also said it would recommend a departmental inquiry against CBI officials for making public servant Kuldeep Singh the accused number one in the case. ""No material found against you. I am surprised why you are implicated,"" ANI quoted the judge as saying.Advocate Vivek Jain, counsel for AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal, said the court had carefully examined the record.""The court has said that it meticulously went through all evidence produced by CBI and not a shred of allegation can be said to cross the threshold of charge. The court has discharged them, saying that there is no allegation which can be held to be true in this matter. The court has also said that the framing of the excise policy was done through institutional safeguards, and there cannot be any doubt on the mannerism and the way the policy has been framed,"" he told ANI.According to the court, the prosecution's theory was based on ""conjecture"" rather than ""concrete evidence"" and failed to withstand judicial scrutiny. The judge concluded that no prima facie case was made out against any of the 23 accused and ordered their discharge.However, sources in the probe agency told ANI that the CBI will approach the Delhi High Court to challenge the Rouse Avenue Court’s judgment discharging Kejriwal and Sisodia.Reacting to the verdict outside the court, Kejriwal said, "" Today, the court has discharged all accused in this case. We always said that the truth emerges victorious. We have full faith in the Indian legal system. Amit Shah and Modi ji together hatched the biggest political conspiracy to finish AAP and 5 big leaders of the party were put in jail.""""The sitting CM was dragged out of his house and put in jail. Kejriwal is not corrupt. I have only earned honesty in my life. Today, the court has said that Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia and AAP are honest,"" he added.The case stemmed from alleged corruption in the Delhi Excise Policy 2021–22 introduced by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government and later scrapped.The CBI registered an FIR in August 2022 following a complaint by Delhi Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena. The agency alleged that irregularities were committed in the formulation and implementation of the excise policy.According to the CBI, the policy was designed to favour select private liquor entities by reducing licence fees and fixing profit margins, leading to kickbacks and financial losses to the Delhi government.The agency further claimed that alleged loopholes were intentionally created after the tender process to extend undue advantage to specific licensees.It claimed that a criminal conspiracy was hatched during the policy's formulation and that Rs 100 crore was paid by a ""south lobby"" to influence the policy.In total, chargesheet was filed against 23 people in the case, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, K Kavitha, Kuldeep Singh, Narender Singh, Vijay Nair, Abhishek Boinpally, Arun Ramchandra Pillai, Mootha Goutam, Sameer Mahendru, Amandeep Singh Dhall, Arjun Pandey, Butchibabu Gornatla, Rakesh Joshi, Damodar Prasad Sharma, Prince Kumar, Chanpreet Singh Rayat, Arvind Kumar Singh, Durgesh Pathak, Amit Arora, Vinod Chauhan, Ashish Mathur, and P Sarath Chadra Reddy.","""no overarching conspiracy"" court clears arvind kejriwal, manish sisodia in excise case.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police arrested 14 individuals, including office bearers of the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU), in connection with a march held on Thursday that allegedly turned violent.Those arrested include Nitish Kumar (former JNUSU President), Aditi Mishra (JNUSU President), Gopika Babu (JNUSU Vice President), and Danish Ali (JNUSU Joint Secretary).Police said around 25 personnel were injured during the incident, including ACP Vasant Kunj Ved Prakash, ACP (CAW) Sanghamitra, SHO (Sarojini Nagar) Atul Tyagi, and SHO (Kishangarh) Ajai Yadav. A total of 51 people were detained on Thursday.An FIR was registered under Sections 221 (obstructing a public servant in discharge of public functions), 121 (voluntarily causing hurt or grievous hurt to deter a public servant from duty), 132 (assault), and 3(5) (common intention) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).According to police, a protest march called by the JNUSU turned violent after participants attempted to move outside the campus despite being denied permission.A call was given for a “Long March” from the university campus to the Ministry of Education.“The JNU administration already intimated the organisers that no permission was granted for such a protest outside the campus, and they were advised to restrict themselves to the university premises,” DCP (Southwest) Amit Goel said.Despite repeated requests not to proceed beyond the campus, around 400–500 students gathered at the main gate at about 3.20 pm and began marching towards the Ministry of Education, police said.

Bengaluru Metro Fare Hike: Un-fare deal: Namma Metro fare hike sparks backlash as Bengaluru commuters shift back to private vehicles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/un-fare-deal-bengalureans-restart-own-vehicles/articleshow/128793617.cms,"Bengaluru: Ex-BBMP Engineer’s Suicide After Corruption Probe, Infant Injury at Hospital

Namma Metro Fare hike that was proposed

Reactions with mugshots:





BENGALURU: The huge gains of Metro as a friendly and efficient public transport are being undone by frequent fare hikes and last-mile connectivity woes. The perception that commuting by Metro in Bengaluru is becoming increasingly expensive is gaining ground: More commuters are returning to their personal vehicles, worsening traffic congestion across the city.While there is no data-based quantification yet (such as new vehicle sales in the recent past), both motorists and traffic police say they are witnessing a perceptible slowdown in traffic flow. Officers note a visible surge in the number of two-wheelers on city roads, especially during peak hours. Once seen as faster, safer and relatively affordable, Namma Metro is no longer the obvious first choice for many commuters.According to transport department data, Bengaluru city has over 80 lakh registered two-wheelers as of 2026. Traffic police fear that a renewed reliance on private vehicles will translate into longer travel times and mounting congestion in the coming months.Unni Krishna Menon, who earlier commuted by Metro between Jalahalli and Indiranagar, has now switched back to his car. ""While the Metro is convenient, the proposed fare hikes and last-mile connectivity gaps would make it less viable for me.Travelling from Jalahalli to Indiranagar costs around Rs 70 one way, and I pay Rs 30 for the first four hours of parking. On reaching Indiranagar, I still need an autorickshaw or a cab to reach my office in Domlur. Each day cost me Rs 220, but if I fill my car with Rs 500 petrol, I can go for 2.5 days, which is cheaper,"" Menon explained the commute math to TOI.Echoing this sentiment, college student Jatin Polanki said he has shifted to his bike, well almost. ""I used to take the Metro regularly in my first year, travelling from Pattanagere to Majestic for about Rs 30 one way. After the initial hike in fares and early classes, I started using a bike. In Rs 100, I can go to college, roam around, and come back.""Resident welfare groups warn that higher user charges for essential services could prove counterproductive. Christopher Cruz of NERWA said, ""Public transport is any city's lifeline and critical to decongesting the city. Revenue cannot be a consideration. Making the Metro expensive in a city like Bengaluru, already infamous for traffic, is counterproductive.""Some commuters argue that cost alone is not the deciding factor. Techie Naresh Sadasivan said, ""Public transport will win 10 out of 10 times if it offers good connectivity and user experience. What pushes people to private transport is unpredictability and poor interconnectivity. Fix that, and people will pay a fair price.""0–2 km: Rs 11 (previously Rs 10)2–4 km: Rs 21 (previously Rs 20)4–6 km: Rs 32 (previously Rs 30)6–8 km: Rs 42 (previously Rs 40)8–10 km: Rs 53 (previously Rs 50)10–15 km: Rs 63 (previously Rs 60)15–20 km: Rs 74 (previously Rs 70)20–25 km: Rs 84 (previously Rs 80)25–30 km / Above 30 km: Rs 95 (previously Rs 90)Ramdev Satyanarayana, RWA, Konankunte""The Metro fare hike is concerning for the commuter. Though I have access to both a car and a two-wheeler, I consciously chose Metro because it is safer, faster, and far more convenient. However, fare hikes leave commuters like me with little choice but to reconsider our travel options. Such increases risk discouraging daily commuters who depend on affordable public transport. Keeping the Metro accessible is crucial not just for commuters, but also for reducing traffic congestion and promoting sustainable urban mobility. ""Shivkumar V, general secretary, Domlur Layout Resident Welfare Association""The repeated fare increases place a direct burden on the common man, another steep revision is unfair. This will inevitably push people back to private vehicles or already overcrowded public buses, worsening road congestion.""Shany Sunny, Joint Secretary, Indiranagar Stage 1 RWA""I know of friends and family members who shifted back to bikes. The primary reason is the increase in fares — for many, travelling by bike is cost-effective. An overcrowded Metro no longer feels like a comfortable escape from the daily commute rush. While it may help avoid vehicular pollution, the experience itself is stressful due to the heavy crowd.""","More commuters are returning to their personal vehicles, worsening traffic congestion.

You are making unnecessary complaints,” CJI Surya Kant said.The remark came after Kapil Sibal levelled the serious charge before the CJI and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that “strange things have happened. EC officials are giving training to judicial officers, who were deployed by the Calcutta HC CJ, on which documents submitted with claims of voters are to be accepted.”Sibal said it marked a violation of the SC’s direction that the modalities would be decided by the chief justice of Calcutta HC. The bench, however, disliked the issues relating to SIR being raked up every now and then by the Bengal govt for one or the other reason.“When we said the HC CJ will decide the modalities, we meant he would decide which judicial officer is to be deployed where and what facilities were to be provided to him. The judicial officer alone will decide the pending claims and validity of documents submitted by the voters,” said the bench, disagreeing with Sibal’s charge about the EC disregarding the SC. Justice Bagchi said, “If the EC officials will not give training to judicial officers, who else will. Our order is as clear as daylight. We gave an alien responsibility to the judicial officers to expedite SIR. Both the state govt and the EC must provide and create a congenial atmosphere for them to work.”Finding the state at the receiving end, Sibal said “the state chief secretary is here as unfortunately her voting rights are being put to question by the EC”. The bench said, “Ask your chief secretary to work in tandem with the EC and judicial officers for expeditious completion of SIR.”Sibal turned to another aspect and said the EC must publish the supplementary voter lists after the publication of the final voter list on Feb 28, as and when a cluster of voters’ names were decided by the judicial officers for inclusion in the voter list.The bench said SIR would be carried out strictly in accordance with court’s orders, which also specify which documents to be accepted for scrutiny of claims.","The supreme court on friday rapped the west bengal govt for rushing to court every now and then with “vague and irrelevant’ reasons to delay the completion of the special intensive revision of state electoral rolls. The bench said sir would be carried out strictly in accordance with court’s orders, which also specify which documents to be accepted for scrutiny of claims.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128866618,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1267530,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

‘Targeting People Like Terrorists’: Mamata Banerjee Attacks EC Over SIR, Cites Bangladesh Polls

NEW DELHI: The All India Trinamool Congress TMC ) on Thursday announced four candidates for the upcoming Rajya Sabha elections, triggering a sharp political attack from the Bharatiya Janata Party;s West Bengal unit over the choices.In a statement, the TMC said it had nominated Babul Supriyo, former West Bengal director general of police Rajeev Kumar, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy and actor Koel Mallick. The party said the nominees reflected Trinamool's commitment to ""resilience"" and to safeguarding the rights and dignity of citizens.""May they continue to uphold Trinamool's enduring legacy and its unwavering commitment to the people of India,"" the party said in its official announcement.The nominations, however, drew an immediate and caustic response from the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal. The BJP alleged that half of Trinamool's Rajya Sabha nominees were non-Bengalis, questioning chief minister Mamata Banerjee 's oft-stated pro-Bengal stance.""Couldn't Mamata Banerjee find enough Bengalis to nominate? Or is she rewarding those who hold her dirty secrets and are willing accomplices in her crime and corruption syndicate?"" the BJP's West Bengal unit said in a statement, accusing the TMC of using Bengali identity only as an electoral tool.The BJP further alleged that Banerjee ""despises Bengalis"" while claiming to champion their cause, and said the nominations exposed what it called the hollowness of Trinamool's regional pride narrative.","The all india trinamool congress tmc ) on thursday announced four candidates for the upcoming rajya sabha elections.

""No Overarching Conspiracy"" Court Clears Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia In Excise Case

Kejriwal hits back with 'Congress has no shame' remark

NEW DELHI: The political tremors from the Delhi excise policy verdict rippled beyond the courtroom on Friday as the Congress lashed out at the ruling BJP, alleging that Arvind Kejriwal's discharge was timed against the backdrop of the Gujarat and Punjab elections.Kejriwal, who had briefly allied with the Congress ahead of the 2024 general elections, hit back at his former ally, accusing it of having ""no shame"" and drawing a contrast between AAP leaders going to jail and the Congress high command remaining out of legal clutch.Soon after a Delhi court granted relief to Kejriwal in the alleged liquor scam case, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera attacked the BJP, likening it to an """" (shape-shifting serpent).In a post on X, he alleged that the BJP was deploying central agencies as ""campaign tools"" with key state elections approaching, calling it ""vendetta as governance.""Khera argued that the BJP’s ideological positions were secondary to its ""obsessive goal"": the realisation of a ""Congress-Mukt Bharat."" He cited what he described as the party’s ""fluctuating relationship"" with the Trinamool Congress (TMC) as evidence of political opportunism.""The BJP is not a political party. It is a shape-shifter, a wishful serpent - Icchadhari Naag. It will stoop to any level for one obsessive goal: defeat Congress - Congress Mukt Bharat. For 12 years they spewed venom at the TMC. And now? Narendra Modi himself is showering it with praise - not out of respect, but to land a cheap blow at Congress,"" Khera's post read.Khera also predicted that cases against Congress leaders would intensify as elections draw closer, citing senior leader P Chidambaram as an example.""Elections are coming. So the script is predictable. Cases against Congress leaders will suddenly accelerate - @PChidambaram_IN has already been dragged back into the spotlight because Tamil Nadu is going for polls,"" he wrote in the post.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) recently granted prosecution sanction against Chidambaram in the Aircel Maxis Deal and INX Media cases.""Meanwhile, proceedings against their ""convenient allies"" in the AAP and others will quietly vanish in light of the Gujarat and Punjab elections,"" he wrote on X.Describing the developments as part of the ""BJP playbook,"" Khera alleged that the ruling party uses central agencies as ""campaign tools"".""This is the BJP playbook: vendetta as governance and agencies as campaign tools,"" he said.Responding to the Congress’ remarks, Kejriwal targeted Pawan Khera, who suggested that the narrative was being pushed to politically corner the Congress ahead of the Punjab and Gujarat elections.Questioning how many Congress leaders had gone to jail, the AAP supremo said the party had ""no shame.""""I want to ask the Congress - Kejriwal went to jail. Did Robert Vadra go to jail? Sanjay Singh went to jail. Did Rahul Gandhi go to jail? Sanjay Singh went to jail. Did Sonia Gandhi ji went to jail? What is Congress saying? Does it have no shame?"" Kejriwal asked.The political exchange followed a detailed order from a Special Court in Delhi, which held that the prosecution had failed to disclose ""even the threshold of a prima facie suspicion, far less the grave suspicion"" required for framing of charges in the CBI case linked to the Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22.In a strongly worded ruling, Special Judge (PC Act) Jitender Singh of the Rouse Avenue Court said the prosecution’s case was ""legally infirm, unsustainable, and unfit to proceed any further in law"".The court further observed that when the material collected by the agency was tested on admissibility, relevance and probative value, ""the appearance of a coherent conspiracy dissolves,"" exposing the allegations as being founded on inadmissible material and post-facto reconstruction.Among those discharged are Arvind Kejriwal, and former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and 21 others.The court was also critical of the Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI) reliance on approver statements, cautioning that granting pardon to an accused and then using his testimony to fill gaps in the prosecution’s case or implicate additional accused would undermine constitutional safeguards.The FIR in the case was registered in August 2022 following a complaint by Delhi Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena, alleging that the now-scrapped excise policy was designed to favour select liquor licensees by reducing licence fees and fixing profit margins, leading to kickbacks and losses to the exchequer.","The congress lashed out at the ruling bjp, alleging that arvind kejriwal's discharge was timed against the backdrop of the gujarat and punjab elections.

Kejriwal returns from ‘exile’

Big boost for AAP ahead of Punjab assembly elections

Renewed challenge for Congress

Opposition rallies behind Kejriwal

BJP under opposition fire

NEW DELHI: Arvind Kejriwal is back with a bang. A Delhi court today discharged the former Delhi chief minister, his ex-deputy Manish Sisodia and 21 others in an excise policy-related corruption case that had kept senior AAP leaders months in jail and had also played a key role in the eventual fall of their government.Special judge Jitendra Singh refused to take cognisance of the CBI chargesheet in the case and observed that the central agency's charges did not withstand judicial scrutiny, especially when the CBI sought to construct a narrative of conspiracy on mere conjecture.""This court has no hesitation in holding that the material placed on record does not disclose even a prima facie case, much less any grave suspicion, against any of the accused persons. Accordingly, Accused Nos 1-23 are discharged of all the offences alleged against them in the present case,"" special judge Jitendra Singh said.""There is no material to show his presence at any conspiratorial meeting or to indicate his knowledge of any unlawful arrangement. The attempt to implicate him rests on an inference drawn from an uncorroborated accomplice-like statement,"" he said.An emotional Kejriwal asserted that the corruption case against him was the ""biggest political conspiracy"" in the history of Independent India.He blamed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah for plotting against AAP.""The court has proved that Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia and AAP are 'Kattar Imaandar',"" the three-time chief minister said.But has this court vindication come too late?The excise policy case had forced the AAP chief to quit as Delhi chief minister and also played a key role in Kejriwal’s electoral defeat in the 2025 assembly elections. Kejriwal became the first sitting Delhi chief minister to be arrested on March 21, 2024. He later got bail from the Supreme Court on September 13 of the same year.So, what does this verdict mean for Kejriwal and national politics?Arvind Kejriwal had literally been in a self-imposed exile ever since he lost power to the BJP in Delhi. But the court verdict today saw the return of his aggression and also his “tears”. The former Delhi chief minister was unsparing in his attacks on the BJP, especially Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah.""Two people, PM Modi and Amit Shah, hatched this conspiracy to finish the Aam Aadmi Party. Today, they should apologise to the country. They knew they couldn't beat us in Delhi. They knew people were happy with AAP, and that's why they hatched this case. I have only earned honesty, not money. I am not like them. Now this has been proved that Kejriwal and AAP are 'Kattar Imandaar' (brutally honest),"" Kejriwal alleged after the court verdict.""BJP has thrown Delhi into chaos with problems like pollution, polluted Yamuna, damaged roads... I challenge PM Modi to hold fresh polls in Delhi and if BJP wins over 10 seats, I will quit politics,"" the AAP chief asserted.While elections in Delhi are far away, the court verdict will come as a big boost to Arvind Kejriwal in Punjab which has an AAP government. Kejriwal, who has been focusing on preparing ground for the assembly elections in Punjab next year, will go all out to cash in on this court vindication. In the last assembly elections, the AAP had swept out the Congress , winning 92 of the 117 seats with a vote share of 40%. The Congress with 18 seats and the BJP with 2 seats were literally decimated.The Congress had an interesting reaction to make after the court relief for Kejriwal. The party would perhaps be worried about the impact of this, especially in Punjab, where the Congress would have hoped to target the AAP on corruption issues.Little wonder, the Congress reaction was somewhat guarded. While it used the judgment to target the BJP, it was quick to call Kejriwal’s discharge as “predictable script” and dub AAP as a “convenient ally” of the saffron party. A politically strong Kejriwal is not good news for Congress not just in Punjab, but also in Gujarat where the AAP has made strong inroads at the expense of the grand-old-party.""The BJP is not a political party. It is a shape-shifter, a wishful serpent - 'Icchadhari Naag'. It will stoop to any level for one obsessive goal: defeat Congress - 'Congress Mukt Bharat',"" Congress media and publicity cell head Pawan Khera said.""Elections are coming. So the script is predictable. Cases against Congress leaders will suddenly accelerate -- P Chidambaram has already been dragged back into the spotlight because Tamil Nadu is going to the polls. Meanwhile, proceedings against their convenient allies in the AAP and others will quietly vanish in light of the Gujarat and Punjab elections,"" the Congress leader added.Kejriwal, who was once a strong claimant to lead the opposition bloc by virtue of his electoral victories against the BJP, faced political oblivion after alleged charges in the excise policy case and his party’s loss in Delhi. After today’s verdict, almost all opposition parties rallied strongly behind him. Opposition parties said in unison that the development was a blow to the Centre's falsehoods and misuse of investigating agencies. The Trinamool Congress and the Left parties welcomed the verdict and said it exposed the BJP's politics of vendetta.Akhilesh Yadav said the collapse of the excise policy case was a ""moral death sentence"" for the BJP as it had betrayed the people of Delhi. ""Today, every honest person will breathe a sigh of relief, while the BJP supporters must be writhing in deep shame,"" Yadav said.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav welcomed the court order and demanded that fresh elections be held in the national capital.The BJP, which carried out a sustained campaign against Arvind Kejriwal and his AAP government over the excise policy and eventually won the Delhi elections, came under intense opposition fire after today’s court verdict. The opposition parties renewed their attacks on BJP for ""misusing central agencies as weapons against political rivals"".""This is a really important day for the politics of the country. Narendra Modi ji was hatching a conspiracy with the strength of ED and CBI just to be in power; that conspiracy has been foiled...The country is questioning him today...SC had already said that the case won't stand the trial. Today, the judge said the same...An inquiry has been set up on the CBI officer. BJP should admit that they were lying,"" said AAP leader Manish Sisodia, who spent 17 months in jail in connection with the case.And while the BJP rubbished all these charges, it would perhaps be wary of the possible fallout of the verdict in West Bengal, which goes to elections in a few months time. The BJP is the principal challenger to Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress and has led a very aggressive campaign against the West Bengal government. Mamata will likely use the court verdict to discredit the BJP’s offensive against her government and blame the saffron party for using investigative agencies as political tools.","A delhi court today discharged the former delhi chief minister, his ex-deputy manish sisodia and 21 others in an excise policy-related corruption case.

NEW DELHI: To determine whether an OBC woman candidate came within the creamy layer to be disentitled from reservation in govt employment, what should be taken into consideration - income of her husband or that of her parents? Supreme Court has agreed to examine this question.The woman, aspiring to become a judicial officer in Karnataka, belongs to the Hindu Namadhari community which is under II-A of reserved category. In April 2018, she married a man who belongs to III-B of reserved category, and has been residing separately from her parents since then. She has applied for the post of civil judge, where six posts out of 57 are reserved for candidates belonging to category II-A.After her selection, she sought verification of her caste certificate and issuance of 'Sindhutva' certificate based on her husband's income. The district caste and income verification committee rejected her application saying she belonged to the creamy layer owing to the quantum of her parent's income.Her mother had retired as a district judge from Karnataka judicial service, and her father retired as assistant conservator of forest. She contended before Karnataka HC that eligibility of a married woman should be decided on her husband's income and not that of her parents.She said her husband's annual income put her out of the purview of creamy layer disqualification.The state govt had argued that pension of parents should also be considered for this purpose. The HC had rejected her claim and ruled that the pension of her parents would also be considered as family income.Arguing her appeal against the HC decision, senior advocate Sanjay M Nuli told a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi on Wednesday that the appeal raised a question of law - whether the income of the husband or the income of the parents was to be considered for determining creamy layer of a married woman candidate and, if the income of the parents was to be considered, whether the pension of the parents was to be considered as income or not?The bench issued notice to Karnataka govt and asked it to respond to the appeal within two weeks. It has permitted the appellant to file a rejoinder in a week thereafter and posted the matter for further hearing on April 6.","Sc has asked karnataka govt to respond to the appeal within two weeks.

""No Overarching Conspiracy"" Court Clears Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia In Excise Case

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Friday sharply criticised the Central Bureau of Investigation CBI ) for repeatedly using the term “South Group” in its chargesheet, while it discharged former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal , former education minister Manish Sisodia and 21 others in the liquor policy case.The court said the nomenclature had no basis in law and cautioned the agency to exercise restraint in its choice of language in investigative narratives.Special Judge Jitendra Singh said, “The court considers it necessary to place on record its concern with the repeated and deliberate use of the expression, 'South Group', by the investigating agency to describe a set of accused persons, ostensibly based on their regional origin or place of residence.”“It is equally significant that no comparable regional descriptor has been employed for the remaining accused persons. The prosecution narrative does not speak of any 'North Group' or similar categorisation. The selective adoption of a geographically-defined label is, therefore, plainly arbitrary and unwarranted,"" he added, as quoted by news agency PTI.The court also said that region-based labelling could create a prejudicial impression and was inconsistent with constitutional principles.“The continued use of this label, despite the absence of any legally-sustainable basis, carries a real risk of colouring perception, causing unintended prejudice and diverting focus from the evidentiary material, which alone must guide adjudication,” it said.Observing that the issue was not merely semantic, adding that, “Identity-based labelling, whether by ethnicity, nationality or regional origin, cannot be employed as a prosecutorial shorthand where such identity is irrelevant to the offence. Such labelling is not a mere irregularity of expression, it constitutes a constitutional infirmity capable of undermining the fairness of the proceedings themselves. ""The Judge Jitendra Singh asked the central agency to exercise “greater care, circumspection and restraint” while drafting chargesheets and investigative narratives. “Descriptions of accused persons must remain strictly neutral, evidence-based and free from expressions that carry a stigmatic, divisive or pejorative overtone,” he said, adding that the use of such terminology violates constitutional provisions.“Persistence with such nomenclature risks undermining the due process of law and is best avoided in the interest of an impartial and constitutionally-compliant administration of criminal justice,” he added.","Kejriwal, sisodia after being cleared of all charges.

SRINAGAR: Public Safety Act (PSA) was invoked by authorities against a suspect with “non-seriousness” that beats even the sloppiness in issuing a “routine traffic challan”, Jammu and Kashmir high court has held and ordered release of the man jailed nearly two years under J&K’s preventive detention law.The single-judge bench of Justice Rahul Bharti quashed the April 20, 2024, detention order against Shabir Ahmad Dar, 28, ruling that the action against the resident of Anantnag’s Kokernag was “illegal right from its inception”. PSA allows detention up to two years without trial.“This court has no hesitation in observing that J&K Public Safety Act against the petitioner has been invoked by non-seriousness of standard with which even a motorist is not subjected to a routine traffic challan,” Justice Bharti said in a recent order.J&K politicians, especially former CM Mehbooba Mufti and Peoples Conference’s Sajad Lone, have long alleged hundreds of illegal PSA detentions and pressed for the release of such people.In this case, the Anantnag SSP had submitted a dossier against Dar to the district magistrate (DM) in April, 17, 2024 seeking Dar’s PSA detention, claiming his activities were “prejudicial to J&K’s security”. Twelve days later, the DM ordered Dar’s detention in a Jammu prison.Section 8 of PSA gives J&K DMs’ powers to detain anyone under PSA on grounds of security.In this case, the Anantnag DM relied on the police dossier of two pages and an FIR of July 2022 under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) to book Dar. The grounds of detention mentioned Dar’s work at a madrassa in Kokernag as well as alleged suspicious activities on social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp and Snapchat.Dar moved the HC against detention in May 2024. Justice Bharti held that his detention “is literally on the dictation of the SSP Anantnag, with the DM Anantnag, at no point of time applying his own independent mind”.Justice Bharti questioned how the authorities could cite an FIR in which Dar did not figure as an accused or an undertrial to justify their apprehension about “alleged activities perceived to be prejudicial to the security of the State”.“To put it simply, the petitioner has been subjected to preventive detention custody just by a blank reference on the part of the SSP followed by equally bland application of mind on the part of the DM Anantnag,” the HC held.","The single-judge bench of justice rahul bharti quashed the april 20, 2024, detention order against shabir ahmad dar.

The court has said that Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia are honest. Today, the court has discharged all the accused in this case. We have always said that truth emerges victorious. We have full faith in the Indian legal system. Amit Shah and Modi ji together hatched the biggest political conspiracy to finish AAP, and five senior leaders of the party were put in jail.

Kerala Story 2 Sparks Fresh Controversy After Court Notice Over Certification & Content Concerns

NEW DELHI: The Kerala High Court on Friday stayed for two weeks its single judge order that had put the release of the film ‘The Kerala Story 2 – Goes Beyond’ on hold.The division bench stayed the single judge’s interim order which had put the film’s release on hold for 15 days.The development comes amid a legal battle over the film’s screening in the state, with the producer challenging the earlier interim relief granted against its release.On Thursday, Justice Bechu Kurian Thomas had stayed the film’s release for 15 days. The court had observed that there was a prima facie “manifest non-application of mind to the requirement of law” by the censor board, the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC).The judge had also said that “the possibility of communal disharmony or denigration of a community also being prima facie involved in the movie”, and that releasing it without scrutiny by higher authorities would be legally improper.Referring to the teaser, the court had further noted that it had “a prima facie potential to distort public perception and disturb communal harmony”.Following the single judge’s order, the film’s producer Vipul Amrutlal Shah approached a division bench of the high court late on Thursday night.The appeal was heard by a bench comprising Justices Sushrut Arvind Dharmadhikari and P V Balakrishnan, which passed the interim stay order on Friday after having reserved its verdict on Thursday night. The detailed order is awaited.In his appeal, Shah contended that the film does not harm or denigrate the state of Kerala or any religious community and argued that “the film only portrays a social evil”, according to news agency PTI.He also told the court that halting the release would “financially finish” the producers, as the movie was scheduled to be screened in around 1,500 theatres across India and over 300 theatres abroad on February 27.With Friday’s decision, the operation of the earlier order has now been kept in abeyance for two weeks and the film is now screening in theatres.",The kerala high court on friday stayed for two weeks its single judge order that had put the release of the film ‘the kerala story 2 – goes beyond’ on hold.

Inducted in the presence of Chief Minister and DMK president M K Stalin at the party headquarters, Panneerselvam said he would work for the party as a cadre, marking a significant realignment in the state’s political landscape.""I have joined the DMK. I will work and support the DMK as a cadre,"" Panneerselvam told reporters shortly after his induction. His son, P Ravindhranath Kumar, also joined the party.Welcoming him into the fold, Stalin described Panneerselvam as a “dear brother” and praised his humility and virtues.""Former Chief Minister and dear brother Thiru. O. Panneerselvam has joined the mother organisation, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. I welcome him with open arms. He, who bears the name of the great leader of the Dravidian movement, has joined our great movement to safeguard the Dravidian movement's ideology,"" he posted on X.Framing the development in the context of the next Assembly election, Stalin added:""The 2026 Assembly election is a democratic battle between Tamil Nadu and the fascist BJP. It is with this realisation that various democratic forces are joining the DMK alliance. Our brother who has joined us, Thiru. O. Panneerselvam is a loving person, a virtuous person, a humble person! May his arrival be for the welfare! May Tamil Nadu triumph!""Explaining his decision, Panneerselvam said he had chosen to join the DMK to draw a line under his troubled past in the AIADMK.""The decision I've taken is my own, to put a fullstop to the bitter experience for me. I thank CM and DMK President Stalin for accepting me to join DMK. I have joined DMK with full joy. EPS is behaving as a dictator, and he has created a situation where AIADMK cannot get victory,"" Panneerselvam told media persons.Panneerselvam was expelled from the AIADMK in 2022 following a protracted leadership tussle with Edappadi K Palaniswami, a rupture that reshaped the party’s internal power structure and ultimately paved the way for his latest political move.","Former tamil nadu chief minister o panneerselvam formally joined the dravida munnetra kazhagam (dmk) in chennai.

"Retirement age disparity & service condition of armed forces need revisit, says SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/retirement-age-disparity-service-condition-of-armed-forces-need-revisit-says-sc/articleshow/128866948.cms,"NEW DELHI: At a time when govt is attempting to shed the country's colonial vestiges, Supreme Court on Friday asked it to set up an expert panel for revisiting British-era prescribed retirement age and service conditions of armed forces personnel, including Coast Guards.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and justice Joymalya Bagchi passed this order on an appeal filed by govt challenging a Delhi HC order quashing Rule 20(1) and Rule 20(2) of Coast Guard (General) Rules, 1986, which provided that officers of rank of commandant and below would retire at the age of 57 years, while those above commandant would retired on attaining 60 years.Appearing for govt, additional solicitor general Archana Pathak Dave said the HC erred in comparing Coast Guards, which comes under ministry of defence, with central armed police forces like ITBP, CRPF, CISF, and Shashatra Seema Bal.Working of Coast Guard personnel is completely different from the CAPFs personnel and that they come under different ministries, she said.Though the bench stayed the operation of the HC order, thus reviving the different retirement age of two cadres of Coast Guard officers, it said, ""It is high time that these regulations governing the service conditions and retirement age are reviewed. Govt cannot be stuck with the conditions envisaged and drafted in the 1940s.""In its order, the CJI-led bench said, ""Operation of the impugned order shall remain stayed. However, govt shall constitute a committee of domain experts to revisit the conditions of service, including the age of retirement, and submit a report to the court.""On Nov 24 last year, a division bench of the Delhi HC comprising justices C Hari Shankar and Om Prakash Shukla had quashed the two provisions of Rule 20 and said, ""We hold, therefore, that the age of superannuation of 60 would apply to officers of the Coast Guard at all ranks.""This judgment was inspired by an earlier decision of the high court in ' Dev Sharma vs Indo-Tibetan Border Police' case, in which the distinction in retirement age of officers up to commandant and above were erased. The SC had upheld the HC's Dev Sharma judgment.",Supreme court asks it to set up an expert panel for revisiting british-era prescribed retirement age and service conditions of armed forces personnel. A bench of chief justice surya kant and justice joymalya bagchi passed this order on an appeal filed by govt challenging a delhi hc order quashing rule 20.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128866994,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-388293,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
