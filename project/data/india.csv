"Will always strive for social, political justice: CJI-designate Gavai",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-always-strive-for-social-political-justice-cji-designate-gavai/articleshow/121147251.cms,"CJI-designate Justice BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: True to his steadfast alignment to Ambedkar's philosophy of equality and dignity for the downtrodden and a day before taking oath as CJI, Justice Bhushan Ramakant Gavai said he considers his position as a judge and head of judiciary an opportunity to strive for social and political justice .""Justice must be equitable irrespective of a person's social or monetary status,"" Gavai said. ""Timely justice is the ultimate goal,"" he said.Interacting with TOI after visiting the Shanti Stupa in Delhi on the occasion of Buddha Purnima, CJI-designate Justice B R Gavai said B R Ambedkar’s belief in the principles of liberty, equality and fraternity remains eternally essential for India’s democracy and unity.Legal aid to the poor is dear to his heart. He wants National Legal Services Authority and the Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee to synchronise their activities with state- and district-level legal service authorities to create synergy for making litigation affordable and less tortuous for the poor.Diversity and inclusivity is also a mantra that has become part of his decision-making process over the years. “We will attempt to get women judges and give representation to diverse communities in constitutional courts without compromising merit and suitability,” he said.“Timely justice is the ultimate goal,” the CJI-designate said. “Reducing pendency at every level of the three-tier justice delivery system through a long-term strategy is the need of the hour. Augmentation of judicial infrastructure and facilities for litigants, especially in district and taluk level courts, will be given priority during my tenure,” Justice Gavai said. During his tenure, the collegium led by him will have the opportunity to fill five vacancies that will arise in the SC.He will be the first Buddhist CJI and second Dalit, after CJI K G Balakrishnan, in the 75-year history of SC. Ahead of taking oath as the 52nd CJI, the man who inspired him with the ideals of Ambedkar, his late politician father R S Gavai’s prophetic words played on a loop in his mind.He also reflected on his journey in formal education that started from a municipal school in a semi-slum area of his native town Amravati, Vidarbha. He studied in Bombay after his father became vice-chairperson and then chairperson of Maharashtra legislative council. After doing first-year law from Govt Law College, Bombay, he had to return to Amravati to complete LLB as his father fell out with Rajiv Gandhi and did not get the position he had enjoyed in legislative council.After getting his law degree, he started practising in Nagpur, which has a bench of Bombay HC, built a significant practice and shared a professional table with Sharad A Bobde, who went on to become the 48th CJI. Gavai applied for ‘senior’ designation with the intention to shift his practice to Delhi. At that juncture, Bombay HC Chief Justice C K Thakker sought his consent for recommending his name for appointment as an HC judge.He was not inclined, but consulted his parliamentarian father, who told him, “Accept the offer of judgeship. You will contribute more to society. One day, you will become the Chief Justice of India . But I will not be there to see that day.” Gavai Sr died in July 2015, much before Justice Gavai was appointed as an SC judge.Justice Gavai shifted from Nagarapalika Prathamik Vidyalaya, Amravati, to Chikitsak Samuha Madhyamik Shala, Girgaon, Mumbai, when his father became deputy chairperson of Maharashtra legislative council.His mother Kamalatai thought Gavai would lag in English studying in a Marathi medium school and insisted on his admission to Holy Name High School in Colaba.His name was recommended for HC judgeship in 2002, but it was returned as he was less than 45 years in age. He took oath as a judge of Bombay HC on November 14, 2003.","Justice bhushan ramakant gavai said he considers his position as a judge an opportunity to strive for social and political justice. ""justice must be equitable irrespective of a person's social or monetary status,"" he said. He wants national legal services authority and the supreme court legal aid committee to synchronise their activities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121147258,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-526900,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
"Ghost litigant, mystery lawyers and fake deal take SC for a ride",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ghost-litigant-mystery-lawyers-and-fake-deal-take-sc-for-a-ride/articleshow/121147165.cms,"The Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: A litigant managed to get a favourable order from Supreme Court after he propped up a ""ghost"" opponent who told the court that he had compromised with the petitioner in a land dispute, which became the basis for SC for quashing orders passed by a Muzaffarpur trial court and Patna HC against the litigant in the matter.Five months later, the real opponent appeared and told the court that he had neither compromised with the petitioner nor engaged any lawyer to represent him before SC. It also came to light that the lawyer who allegedly represented the fake party does not practice law any more and he was even not aware of the case.Facing the tricky situation of who had appeared before the court on that day and who had placed the 'settlement agreement' that led to passing of the order, a bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Joymalya Bagchi directed its registry to hold an inquiry and file a report within three weeks. Making it clear that the court cannot be taken for a ride, the bench said that it would order lodging of an FIR, if needed.SC had in Dec passed the order after the 'compromise agreement' was placed before it and the order sheet of that day mentioned the names of four advocates who had appeared for the alleged fake respondent, including advocate-on-record (AOR) J M Khanna and his daughter Shefali Khanna. In this case, a caveat was filed by the fake respondent due to which notice was not issued by the court which would have been served on the real respondent and he would have come to know about the pending case.The real respondent, who is based in Muzaffarpur in Bihar, came to know about the SC's verdict when his son-in-law stumbled upon it on the SC website and he rushed to the apex court. Advocates Gyanendra Singh and Abhisek Rai, appearing for him, told the bench that the order was obtained by means of fraud, deception and calculated suppression of truth and it should be recalled forthwith.During the hearing, a lawyer appearing for AOR Khanna told the court that he is now 80-years-old and he had not been practising law for the last few years and expressed surprise how his name cropped up in the case. His daughter also told the bench that she also did not appear in the case on that day.""The petitioner has not only acted in violation of legal and ethical norms but has also committed a fraud upon this court, which, if not rectified, will embolden such mala fide litigants to continue their deceitful practices,"" the respondent said. Allowing his plea, the bench withdrew its Dec order and ordered a probe.","A litigant managed to get a favourable order from supreme court after he propped up a ""ghost"" opponent.

Following shelling on May 10, scientists and forest officials moved nine of the 18 chicks born this year to a safer facility in Arwar village of Ajmer district - nearly 500km east. ""The chicks, aged between five and 28 days, were transported in soft-suspension vehicles fitted with padded compartments and sand bedding to reduce stress during the 10-hour journey,"" said Sutirtha Dutta, senior scientist at Wildlife Institute of India (WII).Several of the chicks were hatched through artificial incubation - an effort to revive one of India's most endangered bird species, with fewer than 130 believed to remain in the wild.""The relocation was carried out successfully.

NEW DELHI: When Justice Sanjiv Khanna became the CJI in November last year, many thought it was poetic justice 50 years after his uncle Justice H R Khanna , through a historic political blunder in 1977, was denied the top post for his courageous dissent in support of fundamental rights during the Emergency even though four of his cowering colleagues caved in to govt's brute power.Justice Khanna's tenure as the CJI was short but eventful and challenging. What brought forth his steely resolve to serve transparency and call a spade a spade was the discovery of a huge amount of cash at Delhi high court judge Yashwant Varma's residence. He uploaded videos and the Delhi HC CJ's reports on the incident on the SC website, leaving little to the imagination and winning kudos from the public for meeting challenges head on.On his last working day in the Supreme Court on Tuesday, CJI Khanna said, "" Public trust in judiciary cannot be commanded. It has to be earned."" With CJI-designate B R Gavai as his colleague on the ceremonial bench, Justice Khanna said, ""The country is getting an excellent CJI who is going to uphold fundamental rights, rule of law and the basic doctrines of the Constitution."" He attributed his upbringing and values to his grandfather Sarav Dayal, who was an advocate and an ardent believer in interaction of children with elders.In an informal meeting with SC reporters, CJI Khanna said he won't accept any post-retirement job but he would not give up law and do something related to law.CJI Khanna is a man who walked alone, without security, both in the judicial arena and Lodhi Garden. He inherited the legacy of fearlessness and fairness from his uncle, Justice H R Khanna who was denied the CJI's post because he stood by fundamental rights during Emergency. But justice was probably served when Justice Sanjiv Khanna became the 51st CJI, nearly 50 years after that historical blunder. However, he shunned both the legacy and publicity.Justice Gavai said, ""For a judge, there is no greater privilege than to preside over a bench and decide cases without fear and favour."" CJI Khanna's basics are deeply entrenched in the ideals of justice. He inherited the great H R Khanna's legacy but emerged from the shadow and painted his own legacy through sheer diligence and hard work. His judgments strengthened constitutional principles and ethos - of liberty and rule of law.Another bench partner for the last 10 months, Justice Sanjay Kumar said CJI Khanna never had a summary of the case before him yet remembered page numbers, paragraphs and the content line by line. Asked about this, CJI Khanna had told TOI, ""It is an acquired trait. After becoming a judge, somehow I started remembering the content of the case files line by line.""Law officers - attorney general R Venkataramani, solicitor general Tushar Mehta and additional solicitors general S V Raju and Aishwarya Bhat - who mostly faced the brunt of intense questioning from CJI Khanna, were the most eloquent in praising his judicial acumen, integrity and courage. ""Clarity, sense of justice, something to always learn, crisp judgments that were not thesis, a man who honoured the chair and increased its dignity,"" were some of the accolades that came his way.",Justice khanna's tenure as the cji was short but eventful and challenging.

AGRA: Citing lack of evidence and witnesses turning hostile, a court in Muzaffarnagar acquitted 11 accused in a case of looting and arson during the 2013 riots that left 62 dead and over 50,000 homeless.These 11 people, all residents of Lisarh village in Shamli, were charged with looting and setting fire to the house of one Kamruddin, who fled with his family and later took shelter in a refugee camp, said defence lawyer Yogendra Singh.In his police complaint on Sept 9, 2013, Kamruddin alleged: ""On Sept 8, 2013, a group of people entered my house and looted gold jewellery and Rs 1.8 lakh in cash, and set my house on fire. My family and I somehow managed to escape and took refuge at a relative's house in Shamli.""After Kamruddin filed the complaint at Phugana police station, the SIT filed a chargesheet under multiple sections, including IPC section 436 (mischief by fire with intent to destroy a house) against 11 people.District govt counsel Rajeev Sharma said on Tuesday, ""The court order was passed recently. We will study the order and then decide our course of action.""Several riot-related cases have since resulted in acquittals for lack of evidence and witnesses turning hostile. The total number of pending trials remains unclear due to proceedings in various courts across Muzaffarnagar and Shamli districts.In April this year, a court in Muzaffarnagar acquitted 16 men accused of murder during the 2013 communal riots citing lack of evidence. Again, in Sept 2024, another court acquitted 10 murder accused saying there was insufficient evidence.","A court in muzaffarnagar acquitted 11 accused in a case of looting and arson during the 2013 riots that left 62 dead and over 50,000 homeless.

JAMMU: In the past six-seven years, over 2,000 family bunkers were built for residents of border areas in J&K, the utility of which was realised during the recent Operation Sindoor , said union minister Dr Jitendra Singh during a day-long visit to areas along the international border on Tuesday. He also announced that an additional 600 bunkers would be constructed and an automated, centralised siren system will be set up in border areas.Dr Singh said Kathua was the first district in the country to experiment with family bunkers in border areas when he, as an MP, had taken up the issue soon after Narendra Modi took over as prime minister. Thereafter, more than 2,000 such bunkers came up in the border areas.Following the public demand for more bunkers, Dr Singh said he consulted the administration and immediately issued directions for the construction of 600 additional family bunkers and more later, if needed.In response to citizens’ complaints that the siren was not audible enough, Dr Singh said he directed the use of modern technology instead of manually operated sirens. “An automated, centralised siren system would be installed, which will be controlled from the district headquarters. It will start operating spontaneously, and the siren will be sounded through speakers set up at each border village,” he said.After Operation Sindoor was launched, Kathua district was provided with 39 medical ambulances for the convenience of border dwellers, while two more critical care ambulances were made available at GMC Kathua.During his visit, Dr Singh held a series of meetings with officials of the district administration, led by deputy commissioner Rakesh Minhas, and attended by public representatives including MLAs and DDC members. The minister subsequently met residents of border villages before heading to Jammu GMCH to inquire about the patients injured in Pakistani shelling.","In the past six-seven years, over 2,000 family bunkers were built for residents of border areas in j&k.
