"We have EdTech, but is it the right one?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-have-edtech-but-is-it-the-right-one/articleshow/124009353.cms,"To prepare for the future, investing in human capital is key, and early childhood education can offer the highest returns. Betting on this, non- profits across India are decentralising education using tech & innovation

The writer is founder-CEO of The Convergence Foundation, and founder chairperson of Central Square Foundation

Indian children born today will enter the workforce as young adults by 2047. At this point, India has largely won the battle for universal school enrolment. The one that beckons is universal school learning — imparting highquality education that will create opportunity for all and provide the human capital for a developed India by 2047.Economics Nobel Laureate James Heckman’s work on human capital emphasises the high return on investment in early childhood education (ECE), as early interventions enhance cognitive and non-cognitive skills critical to long-term success. The well-known Heckman curve shows that for all stages of education, the highest economic returns come from the earliest investments in children. To raise the collective intelligence of the nation there is a strong case for investing heavily in ECE, raising its share of the Samagra Shiksha budget to 5% (up from around 2% currently).The ubiquity of smartphones in India today — a recent survey reported a smartphone ownership of 1.5 per household in urban India and 1.3 in rural India — offers a never-before-seen opportunity to rapidly scale up high-quality educational inputs to children across the country regardless of their socio-economic status.This is a simple idea with great power. Educational non-profits have begun work on precisely this, and these efforts will only expand in future.For instance, Rocket Learning, a non-profit launched in 2020, has developed interactive and highly engaging educational content that can be delivered over WhatsApp to teachers, parents and children. Every day on these micro-WhatsApp groups, it sends low-income teachers and parents contextualised content in the local language that they can use for play-based activities with children in the classroom or at home. These activities take less than 20 minutes and involve readily available materials.Research shows that greater parental involvement in children’s education leads to improved academic performance. That sense of participation is reinforced by encouraging parents and educators to share images and videos back to the WhatsApp groups, creating a sense of a shared learning community.Chimple is an android app developed in India, that uses games to instil foundational literacy and numeracy through a teacher-directed, at-home learning model. Using the app, a teacher can remotely assign content for children to practise, based on the teaching plan for the week. In a pilot study involving Class 1 and 2 students in Haryana, the treatment group saw a 50% improvement in test scores over the year with 10 minutes of usage of Chimple in a day. Similar improvements were recorded in English as well, and the low performing learners at the baseline benefited even more.Going up to higher grades of schooling, new learning opportunities can be reinforced by generative AI — a powerful use case for which is Personalised Adaptive Learning (PAL). Instead of the rigid, one-size-fits-all mode of learning that conventional classrooms offer, students can learn at their own pace and in their own space with PAL — making engaging, immersive and interactive learning available at even the remotest of locales. If children of the elite have an edge because they have access to individual high-quality coaches to quickly resolve their problems, such access can be universalised with the help of PAL.Educational non-profit Central Square Foundation (CSF) is working with Khan Academy to contextualise Khanmigo, India’s AI-powered personal tutor for low-income contexts. State govts are beginning to leverage PAL for their school systems. Andhra Pradesh has been a pioneer here as it has made PAL part of its World Bank-aided Supporting Andhra’s Learning Transformation (SALT) programme. Use of PAL to heal educational divides can only grow in future.PAL, however, is not the only AI use case in education. AI can generate the learning content itself — scripts, rhymes, worksheets and illustrations are created using LLMs, saving time and boosting creativity. AI can translate and dub across languages, simplify animation and personalise audio with voice cloning. AI can also drive data analysis at the back-end, using incoming messages to draw nuanced insights into how well specific educational programmes are working.CSF has entered into partnerships to build an AI-powered Teacher Coach for govt school teachers, which can provide actionable feedback to teachers and identify effective levers for measurable improvements in classroom practice. AI tools can also grade large volumes of student work, reducing five minutes of paper checking time to 20 seconds. They can provide nuanced understanding of a student’s performance and actionable insights based on it, thus reducing teachers’ workload and enabling them to engage more students.India’s EdTech sector is already large and bound to grow further. But what parts of it are relevant and useful, and go from being a handmaiden for the rich to being universally enabling? In order to evaluate the many available EdTech solutions, CSF has developed — jointly with IIT Bombay and IIT Delhi — an evaluation index that enables govts and other users to make quality-led, evidence-informed choices regarding EdTech procurement for schools, especially those catering to low-income students.The index is called EdTech Tulna, and helps define quality standards for what good EdTech looks like. It creates exhaustive tool-kits and training for decision-makers to apply these standards to evaluate EdTech products, and publishes reviews of products to drive demand and shape supply.Apart from EdTech innovations, there are innovations at the level of school governance and regulation that can dramatically uplift quality. At present, regulation of schools is heavily input-focused. This priority must now shift to measurement of outcomes, which should be reported transparently, publicly and regularly. Such data will allow parents to choose the best school for their children and vote with their feet, building pressure to improve school quality. It will also allow the best schools to emerge as exemplars whose best practices can be replicated at others too.Other countries have followed this transparency model to effectively improve school quality — including the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted, UK), Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA, Dubai) and Sistema de Medición de la Calidad de la Educación (SIMCE, Chile).The National Education Policy (NEP 2020) talks about a school regulator called the State School Standards Authority (SSSA) to set standards and publicise the level of each school in the state, based on those standards. To be effective, SSSAs need to function independently of the department of education and other govt bodies, and assess the quality of all schools — whether public or private — impartially. As NEP 2020 recommends, they should shift regulation from being overly restrictive (especially for private schools) to being “light but tight”. SSSAs should regularly report on the quality of schools and put these out in the public domain.Every child in India deserves a chance to reach their full potential. With new technologies as well as enabling reforms, we will be well on our way towards fulfilling that dream.","Indian children born today will enter the workforce as young adults by 2047.

It asked BJP to disapprove of the comments from its netas and lodge cases against them, else their remarks would be construed as being made at the instance of the PM and home minister.Congress spokesman and deputy leader of opposition in RS Pramod Tiwari said, “Is BJP seeking to incite civil war in the country? What are its netas saying?” Former BJP MP from UP and senior office-bearer Subrat Pathak said if people come out on the streets like in Nepal, they will burn down the houses of Rahul and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav. He also said if people (like Gen Z) come out in India, they will be chased in the streets.“This is the language being used for the leader of opposition in LS and a former CM.

GURGAON: In yet another alarming incident of lawlessness in Gurgaon, unidentified assailants opened fire at the office of MNR Buildmark in Sector 45 late Thursday night.The attack, which took place around 9.30pm barely a few hundred meters from the Sector 40 police station, has raised serious concerns about security in the area.According to sources, four to five armed men scaled the iron gate of the premises and opened fire at the locked office.More than 15 rounds were fired, some of which struck two luxury cars — a Jaguar and a BMW — parked inside the compound. Security guards on duty rushed indoors to take cover. No casualties were reported.Soon after, gangster Deepak Nandal claimed responsibility for the attack, alleging that Nitin Talwar — a relative of Rohit Raheja, owner of MNR Buildmark — owed him money but had fled to New Zealand with his family in 2019.In a purported message, Nandal also warned others who owed him money and alleged that singer Rahul Yadav alias Fazilpuria had to return Rs 5 crore.Investigations have been complicated by the fact that the CCTV cameras at the premises were found to be non-functional at the time of the incident.Police teams, including a forensic unit and multiple CIA squads, reached the spot soon after the firing. Sub-Inspector Baljeet Singh confirmed that “multiple rounds were fired,” but stressed that no injuries occurred.The motive behind the attack remains under probe.","Unidentified assailants opened fire at the office of mnr buildmark in sector 45 late thursday night.

JAMMU: A special NIA court in Jammu has extended by 45 days the custodial remand of two accused arrested on charges of harbouring Pakistani terrorists involved in the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack.Special judge Sandeep Gandotra on Thursday extended the remand of Pahalgam locals Bashir Ahmad Jothat and Parvaiz Ahmad, who hail from Baisaran and Batkote, respectively, beyond the stipulated 90-day period to allow the NIA more time to complete its probe into the massacre of 26 people, after public prosecutor Chandan Kumar Singh submitted that the investigation was at a crucial stage, and several witness statements yet to be recorded.The investigating agency also stated that crucial evidence was still awaited, including analysis of mobile phone data linked to Pakistani numbers, forensic reports from CFSL Chandigarh and NFSU Gandhinagar, and DNA profiling of seized blankets, shawls and bedsheets to establish links with the slain terrorists. Arms and ammunition recovered in a July 28 encounter were also under forensic analysis, the prosecution said.The two accused were arrested on June 22, and have been in judicial custody at Amphalla district jail in Jammu. Their 90-day remand was set to expire on Sept 19.Opposing NIA’s application for extension of remand, defence counsel Ashwani Kumar countered that the accused had already been in custody for two months without conclusive evidence, and the agency had failed to complete investigation within the time granted.Rejecting the defence plea, the court noted that the allegations were grave and directly linked to national security, and granted 45 days’ extension while directing the investigating officer to complete the probe expeditiously.In another case, the same court dismissed the bail application of Tanveer Ahmed Wani, former chief of the LoC Traders Association, who is accused of channelising funds from Pakistan to strengthen the network of the Hizbul Mujahideen.Wani, a resident of Pulwama, was arrested in Feb 2020. According to the NIA, he had strong links with Pakistan-based Hizbul leadership and personally handed over cash to terrorists. He also facilitated meetings and maintained an over-ground worker network to route money for terror activities.After hearing the prosecution and the petitioner’s counsel, judge Gandotra noted that the accusations were serious and directly linked to national security.

He sought liberty to withdraw the civil revision, with the right to revive it if a compromise application is not filed before trial court within 90 days. The request was not opposed by counsels representing Jyotiraditya Scindia and other respondents.The dispute stems from a 2010 suit filed by the three aunts seeking their share in the family's vast fortune.They argued that daughters have equal rights in their father's property under succession laws. Jyotiraditya Scindia later filed a counter-suit. Both matters have been pending in various courts, with the civil revision reaching the high court in 2017.","The decades-old property dispute within the scindia royal family has inched closer to resolution.

They expect a better performance than in 2020, when key ally Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) had contested independently.Home minister Amit Shah, who will steer the alliance strategy, held the first round of meetings with Janata Dal United boss and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar in Patna on Thursday. Deputy CM Samrat Choudhary, senior JDU netas Sanjay Jha and Vijay Kumar Choudhary also attended the meet.Alliance sources said the two lead allies are likely to agree on contesting almost an equal number of seats, while sparing a reasonable number for other partners, including Chirag Paswan's LJP (Ram Vilas), Jitan Ram Manjhi's Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM), and Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM).Sources said EC is likely to announce Bihar poll dates in the first week of Oct. The BJP-led NDA aims at sealing the seat-sharing arrangements well ahead of that. ""All netas in the Patna meeting agreed to finalise seat-sharing in Sept,"" said a senior NDA member, adding that initial talks have been quite positive with no bottlenecks.Though JDU and BJP are likely to contest an equal number of seats, there is a possibility that JDU will take a couple of more seats to position Nitish Kumar's regional powerhouse as the lead party.Asked about NDA contesting the polls under Kumar, though there has not been a formal announcement he will continue as CM in case of the BJP-led bloc wins, the alliance neta said, ""A formal announcement is not needed as allies are contesting under Nitish Kumar, therefore, it is implied that he is the CM candidate too.""The 30-minute Shah-Kumar meeting was described by NDA sources as a courtesy call. Sources said of the 243 assembly seats, BJP and the JDU are likely to contest approximately 100-102 seats each and the rest will be spared for the three other allies with LJP (Ram Vilas) poised for a larger share.HAM neta and Union Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has openly demanded 15-20 seats. LJP (Ram Vilas) has also sought ""respectable"" representation, with party's Jamui MP Arun Bharti hinting at a claim of 43-137 seats.

"ABVP claims 3 of 4 Dusu posts, NSUI reduced to 1",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/abvp-claims-3-of-4-dusu-posts-nsui-reduced-to-1/articleshow/124009015.cms,"(L to R) ABVP’s Deepika Jha, Aryan Maan, Sarthak Sharma (Delhi secy) & Kunal Chaudhary celebrate (Image credit: Tarun Rawat)

NEW DELHI: The RSS-backed ABVP bagged three key positions, including that of president, in the fiercely contested Delhi University Students' Union (Dusu) elections while the Congress-backed NSUI, which held the top post last year, managed to secure just one. The counting of votes took place Friday.ABVP's Aryan Maan won the president's post, receiving 28,841 votes to defeat NSUI's Joslyn Nandita Choudhary (12,645 votes) by a margin of 16,196 votes. NSUI's Rahul Jhansla emerged victorious as vice-president, getting 29,339 votes to defeat ABVP's Govind Tanwar, who managed 20,547 votes. ABVP's Kunal Chaudhary secured 23,779 votes to win the secretary's post, defeating NSUI's Kabir, while Deepika Jha claimed the joint secretary's post with 21,825 votes, overcoming NSUI's Lavkush Bhadana.ABVP's vote share climbed from 34.7% to 48.1%, its highest in over a decade.""The students of DU have sent a strong message... they trust us,"" Maan said after the victory, draped in the tricolour and surrounded by his jubilant supporters. He promised his first priority as president would be to push for concessional metro passes for students, a long-standing demand across colleges. ""We will work for every student and address all their concerns,"" he said.Aryan Maan's victory on Friday in the Dusu elections carried particular significance, not only because it reclaimed the top post for ABVP after last year's loss, but also because of its scale. The margin for the presidential race leapt from just 1,343 votes in 2024 to over 16,000 this year, a more than 12-fold increase.As the results trickled in at Delhi University Sports Centre in North Campus, the streets echoed with applause and cheers. Outside, supporters gathered, chanting ""Maan, Maan"" as the newly-elected president was hoisted onto the shoulders of his followers, waving the tricolour.A large crowd showered flower petals on the winners as they reached the Arts Faculty. In line with Delhi High Court's directives, the usual fanfare of firecrackers and dhols was largely absent, though occasional drumbeats could be heard. However, ABVP clarified it was not responsible for these. At the Arts Faculty, the winners posed before the Swami Vivekananda statue soon after, continuing a long-standing campus tradition.NSUI's Rahul Jhansla, who had the highest vote tally among all winners, outlined his priorities with quiet determination: ""My top priority is to launch mental health initiatives, with at least one counsellor in every college. I have been raising student issues for six years, and I will continue to stand up for them.""ABVP's Kunal Chaudhary expressed gratitude to the student body, saying, ""I thank every DU student with folded hands - this victory is because of them. My focus will be on getting Wi-Fi installed across colleges and pursuing metro travel concessions.""Deepika Jha, also from ABVP, called the moment ""emotional and proud"". ""For women students, we will work to create girls' common rooms in all colleges and ensure regular patrolling outside girls' colleges,"" she said, as supporters showered her with garlands.Among the AISA-SFI candidates, Anjali received 5,385 votes for president, Sohan Kumar secured 4,163 votes for vice-president, Abhinandana Pratyashi got 9,535 votes for secretary and Abhishek Kumar garnered 8,425 votes for joint secretary.In 2024, NSUI won the president's post after a seven-year gap. Its national president Varun Choudhary wrote on X: ""NSUI fought well... not just against ABVP, but against the combined force of DU admin, Delhi govt, central govt, RSS-BJP & Delhi Police. Yet thousands of DU students stood firmly with us.""Since its start in 1954, the Dusu elections have been a cornerstone of student politics, influencing discourse across the university's 52 affiliated colleges. Over the years, ABVP has emerged as a dominant force, notably sweeping all four key posts in 2015 and continuing its strong performance by winning three major positions in 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2023. Yet, NSUI has remained a persistent challenger, achieving a major breakthrough in 2017 by securing two posts and frequently claiming the vice-president position in subsequent years, consolidating its presence on campus.Voter turnout this year rose to 39.4% from 35.2% in 2024. Turnout has reflected the shifting tides of student engagement, ranging from 36.9% in 2016 to a peak of 43.8% in 2018. These variations underscore the competitiveness of DU politics, with Dusu serving as a microcosm of broader democratic processes in the country.The ""None of the Above"" (NOTA) option drew notable support in the DUSU elections for 2025-26, with 23,674 students opting for it across the four posts. This surge highlighted a clear sense of discontent among the student electorate.","The rss-backed abvp bagged three key positions, including that of president.
