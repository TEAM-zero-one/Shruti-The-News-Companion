"Lakhs in Bihar may lose vote, ADR tells SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lakhs-in-bihar-may-lose-vote-adr-tells-sc/articleshow/122274362.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Election Commission's special intensive revision (SIR) of Bihar's electoral rolls just months before assembly polls has been challenged in Supreme Court with Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) telling the court that the decision has been taken arbitrarily with an impractical timeline and that it would disenfranchise lakhs of people, particularly from marginalised communities. This is against free and fair election, the organisation said.ADR, on whose pleas SC has in the past passed multiple orders to bring in electoral reforms, said in its petition that SIR's requirement for citizenship documentation disproportionately affects marginalised communities, including Muslims, SCs, STs and migrant workers, as Aadhaar and ration cards are not acceptable. Many people who didn't have the requisite documents might not be able to procure it within the short time period fixed by EC, it said.""The SIR order, if not set aside, can arbitrarily and without due process disenfranchise lakhs of voters from electing their representatives, thereby disrupting free and fair elections and democracy in the country,"" the petition said. ""The documentation requirements of the directive, lack of due process as well as the unreasonably short timeline for SIR of electoral roll in Bihar further make this exercise bound to result in removal of names of lakhs of genuine voters from electoral rolls,"" it said.The EC order has ""shifted the onus of being on the voters' list from the State to citizens. It has excluded identification documents such as Aadhaar or ration cards which further makes marginalised communities and the poor more vulnerable to exclusion from voting"", it said.""The declaration as required under SIR process is violative of Article 326 in so far as it requires a voter to provide documents to prove his/her citizenship and also citizenships of his/her mother or father, failing which his/her name would not be added to the draft electoral roll and can be deleted from the same,"" the petition saidTerming the timeline fixed by EC for SIR as unreasonable and impractical, the petition said lakhs of citizens who didn't possess the required documents may not be able to procure the documents within the short time.""Bihar is a state with high poverty and migration rates where many lack access to documents like birth certificates or parental records. As per estimates, over three crore voters and more particularly from marginalised communities could be excluded from voting due to the stringent requirements as mentioned in the SIR order. That the current reports from Bihar, where SIR is already underway, show that lakhs of voters from villages and marginalised communities do not possess the documents as being sought for them,"" the petition said.Questioning EC's decision allegedly taken in haste, the petition pointed out that the commission in May listed 21 initiatives to improve voter access and to streamline poll management but the SIR of electoral rolls was not mentioned.",Election commission's special intensive revision (sir) of bihar's electoral rolls has been challenged in supreme court.

HC junks 300 defence ministry pleas opposing disability pension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-junks-300-defence-ministry-pleas-opposing-disability-pension/articleshow/122274117.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Delhi HC dismissed 300 petitions filed by defence ministry challenging Armed Forces Tribunal's order that had granted disability pensions to soldiers even when they were not posted on front lines, observing that disability pensions to armed forces personnel acknowledge their sacrifice to the nation.""It is not an act of generosity, but a rightful and just acknowledgment of the sacrifices endured by them, which manifest in the form of disabilities or disorders suffered during the course of their military service. It is a measure that upholds the State's responsibility towards its soldiers,"" said the division bench comprising Justices Navin Chawla and Shalinder Kaur.Govt had approached court, arguing that medical conditions of soldiers involved in these cases were neither attributable to nor aggravated by military service and, therefore, they were not entitled to disability element of the pension.Attorney general R Venkataramani, on Centre's behalf, contended that the presumption - where a member of the armed forces is deemed to have been in sound physical and mental health upon entering service unless a disability was noted at the time of enlistment - no longer applies.However, the court observed that disability pension cannot be denied solely on grounds that onset of the disability occurred while the soldier was posted at a peace station.""Undisputably, even when not on the front lines or in hard areas, soldiers are aware that the threat is never far away. This environment, where danger is a constant reality for their peers and could become their own at any moment, creates a persistent state of mental and emotional strain that cannot be overlooked,"" the court said.",Delhi hc dismissed 300 petitions filed by defence ministry challenging armed forces tribunal's order that had granted disability pensions to soldiers even when they were not posted on front lines.

CBI HIDING RAPISTS: Shocking Cover-up Allegation by RG Kar Victim's Father, Vows to Reveal Truth

Poll Do you believe that the police response to such incidents is swift and adequate? Yes, they handle it well. No, they could do better.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)





PUNE: A man, posing as a courier delivery agent, entered a 22-year-old data scientist's 11th floor rented flat in a residential society in Kondhwa on Wednesday evening, sprayed some chemical on her face and allegedly raped her.""He also used the woman's cellphone to click a selfie with her, cropped his image and keyed in a message threatening her that he would upload the photograph on social media if she disclosed the incident to anyone,"" deputy commissioner of police (Zone IV) Rajkumar Shinde told TOI on Thursday. ""We have seen the cropped selfie image and the message on the survivor's phone after collecting the gadget from her,"" he said.The woman, who has a BE degree in data science, works with an IT firm in Kalyaninagar and has been staying with her younger brother (20) in the rented flat since 2022, an office-bearer of the society told TOI. The society is made up of a single 11-storey building divided into ‘A', ‘B' and ‘C' wings. It has a single entrance gate with a security cabin having two guards each in the morning and night shifts and also has an app for community and safety management of the residents.The woman and her brother are from Akola. They shifted to Pune a few years ago for employment. Her brother had gone to Akola, and she was alone in the flat when the ""delivery agent"" came calling, police said.DCP Shinde said: ""The woman said in her complaint that she responded to the doorbell around 7.15pm and found a man, who claimed to be from a courier firm, waiting. The man told her that he needs to deliver a parcel from a bank. He asked her to acknowledge receipt of the parcel by signing on a delivery sheet he was carrying, and told her that he had forgotten his pen. When the woman went in to bring the pen, the man seized the moment to step in and bolted the door from inside before using the spray on her face. ""He said: ""The woman regained consciousness around 8.30pm and sensed something wrong was done to her. She alerted her relatives, who, in turn, informed the police. She has been admitted to a govt hospital for medical examination. Our forensic experts will examine what kind of chemical substance the intruder used to spray on her face. For now, 10 teams from the Kondhwa police and the city crime branch have been deployed to work on leads to arrest the culprit. ""Experts visited the crime scene and collected forensic evidence. A spot panchnama was drawn. A dog squad was pressed into service, but it did not pick up the trail of the culprit, police said.""We have identified 10 delivery agents from courier and e-commerce firms and food delivery services, who visited the society on Wednesday and are verifying them,"" said an officer, who is part of the probe. The police have registered a case relating to offences punishable under sections 64 (rape), 77 (voyeurism) and 351(2) (criminal intimidation) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.Pune police commissioner Amitesh Kumar told TOI: ""We have collected the survivor's oral and nasal swab to establish the chemical substance alleged to have been used to render the survivor unconscious. We are certain about detecting the case soon and have roped in all our resources considering the nature and gravity of the crime.""Also read: Pune rape case: 'Delivery agent' who assaulted techie in flat arrested after 2 days; police investigating Preliminary investigation revealed that the intruder did not make an entry in the visitors' register maintained by the society.

The guards on duty have so far maintained that there was no entry or exit of any person around the time of the incident nor any outsider has been spotted in CCTV covering the passage leading to the ‘A' wing where the survivor stays.A society office bearer told TOI at the site: ""The brother-sister duo share a cordial relationship with all our members and have been paying their rent on time to the flat owner, who lives in Mumbai. The society is covered by two CCTV cameras. The 'A' wing, where the incident occurred, has CCTV cameras covering the passage, parts of the other wings and the parking area.""He said: ""We have installed a mobile application, a visitor management facility, to regulate entry on the society premises. Each member and tenant of the society has this application on their mobiles. We studied all the entries and exits on the application and realised that no delivery persons — like food delivery, quick commerce or e-commerce — entered the society when the incident occurred. We have provided all details of the cellphone application and CCTV footage to the police. ""The office-bearer added: ""Only one thing could have happened. A delivery person, who has four or five deliveries to make in different flats, could have entered the society and then might have gone to the woman's flat. It does not require a separate entry on the mobile application when it comes to multiple deliveries.""","A man, posing as a courier delivery agent, entered a 22-year-old data scientist's 11th floor rented flat in a residential society in kondhwa on wednesday evening.

PATNA: Congress's announcement that it would distribute five lakh sanitary pad boxes under its ""Priyadarshini Udaan Yojana"" triggered a political storm in Bihar on Friday after images of party MP Rahul Gandhi appeared on the boxes. NDA criticised the move, calling it a ""direct insult"" to women, who have emerged as key voters in recent state elections.Bihar Congress president Rajesh Kumar, speaking in the presence of All India Mahila Congress chief Alka Lamba, said the scheme was aimed at promoting menstrual hygiene awareness among rural women. ""We have a special plan for womenfolk in Bihar. We plan to provide free sanitary napkins to women for which we will launch an intensive campaign,"" Kumar told reporters. However, controversy erupted when he held up a sanitary pad box displaying Rahul's photo alongside the INDIA bloc's proposed ""Mai-Bahin Maan Yojana"", which promises Rs 2,500 monthly to women if voted into govt.JD(U) MLC and spokesperson Neeraj Kumar accused Congress of degrading the dignity of women. ""Congress seems to have taken a leaf out of the book of its ally, RJD, which has been known for a lumpen style of politics.Our leader Nitish Kumar has been working tirelessly for women's empowerment and the results are for all to see. But Congress has insulted the dignity of women,"" he said.BJP spokesperson Kuntal Krishna echoed the sentiment. ""Whatever needs to be done for women in Bihar is being done by govt. But Congress, which is worried about its prospects in the upcoming assembly polls, has shown its ideological bankruptcy. Its leader, Rahul Gandhi, has been notorious for lacking a sense of propriety. The trait seems to have afflicted the party, in which sycophancy reigns supreme,"" he said.Women expressed disapproval of the design. ""This is nothing but an insult to women who will find the image of a male while using the sanitary pads... Congress is stooping too low to win the support of women voters,"" said Pinki Kumari of Muzaffarpur. ""If Congress thinks it will get support from women by distributing free napkins with the image of Rahul, then it is sheer stupidity,"" she added, arguing the focus should have been on women's safety.""Rahul is trying to emerge as a 'Pad Man' but that is not the way to launch a party campaign,"" said Sunita Singh of Vaishali.Defending the campaign, Lamba said, ""In the modern era, the question should not be why Rahul-ji's photo was put on the sanitary napkin box, the real question is why our daughters in Bihar are still forced to use cloth during menstruation and become victims of serious diseases?""She also criticised BJP's response. ""From a 'sindoor box' to vaccine certificates, BJP, which prints Modi-ji's photo on everything, is now troubled by Rahul-ji's photo. The work that govt should have done, we have started,"" Lamba said, crediting Rahul's ""inspiration and visionary thinking"" for making the campaign possible.","Bihar congress president rajesh kumar said the scheme was aimed at promoting menstrual hygiene awareness among rural women.

NEW DELHI: All India Congress Committee (AICC) was not trying to sell assets of Associated Journals Limited (AJL), the company which published National Herald newspaper, but rather trying to save the institution that was a part of the freedom movement, senior advocate R S Cheema, representing Rahul Gandhi , told a Delhi court Saturday. Cheema made his submissions before the court of special judge Vishal Gogne, which is hearing arguments on the point of cognisance of the chargesheet filed against Sonia Gandhi , Rahul and others in National Herald money laundering case.""In post-Independence period, it (AJL) was never a commercial institution. We (AICC) were trying to retrieve an institution which is part of the freedom movement heritage. The problem was not recovering the loan (given to AJL) but to revive it, to see that it comes back on the rails. AICC was not looking for profit from sales. This is a squinted version,"" Cheema said.According to ED, Sonia and Rahul, along with others and a private company, Young Indian Pvt Ltd, conspired to launder money by fraudulently usurping AJL's properties valued at over Rs 2,000 crore in exchange for a loan of Rs 90 crore. Cheema said ED's allegations were ""crude lies"".The senior advocate said ED made unwarranted inferences against Rahul by wrongly assuming that he was the person in-charge of AICC's affairs as its general secretary in 2010. According to the party constitution, AICC has several general secretaries at a point in time, and no one of them could be in-charge of its affairs, Cheema pointed out. The counsel further stated Sonia, then Congress president, was wrongly inferred as person in-charge of AICC when the loan was assigned to AJL.The arguments will continue against other accused, including Suman Dubey, Sam Pitroda, Sunil Bhandari, Young Indian and Dotex Merchandise Pvt Ltd, on Monday.","All india congress committee (aicc) was not trying to sell assets of associated journals limited (ajl), the company which published national herald newspaper.

NEW DELHI: The three men accused of gangraping a student inside South Calcutta Law College on June 25 spent several hours drinking in the institute’s guard room after committing the crime, police said on Saturday.The prime accused, Monojit Mishra, along with Pramit Mukherjee and Zaib Ahmed, even warned the college’s security guard to stay silent before heading out for dinner.“After committing the crime, the three consumed alcohol in the guard's room and then asked security guard Pinaki Banerjee to keep his mouth shut about the incident,” an investigating officer was quoted as saying to news agency PTI.The trio later went to a dhaba along EM Bypass for dinner before returning to their respective homes the next morning, police said.Investigators believe the gangrape was not a spontaneous act but a planned assault. According to the officer, Call Detail Records (CDRs) revealed multiple conversations among the accused in the days leading up to the incident.The investigation further revealed that Monojit tried to seek help the next day. On June 26, he contacted an “influential” person in Deshapriya Park, someone who had reportedly helped him in the past.However, that individual refused to assist this time, sensing the gravity of the situation, the officer added.After being turned down, Monojit reportedly tried reaching out to several of his so-called “mentors” in different areas of the city. “Monojit went to various parts of the city including Rashbehari, Deshapriya Park, Gariahat, Fern Road, and Ballygunge Station Road, trying to meet his mentors. Mobile tower data also indicated that he visited someone near Karaya police station,” the officer said.Police say Monojit's movements after the crime suggest he was trying to get help to run away or hide the case.Security guard Pinaki Banerjee has also been arrested, and the college has come under scrutiny for lapses in safety and oversight. The case is being probed by a Special Investigation Team formed by Kolkata Police.The incident sparked protests and outrage across the city.","The three men accused of gangraping a student inside south calcutta law college on june 25 spent several hours drinking in the institute’s guard room after committing the crime, police said.

Kedia apologises after vandalism

Police protection and public appeal

Wider context: Mira Road incident

NEW DELHI: Mumbai investor Sushil Kedia’s office in Worli was vandalised on Saturday morning by unidentified individuals allegedly linked to the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), days after he publicly challenged party chief Raj Thackeray and declared he would not learn Marathi. The attackers raised slogans in support of Thackeray and hurled stones at the office. Police have detained five MNS supporters in connection with the incident and said security had already been deployed at the site following earlier threats to Kedia.What do we know so far-Sushil Kedia, a long-time resident of Mumbai and founder of an investment service firm, had posted a provocative message on social media platform X on July 3. In it, he declared: “I don’t know Marathi properly even after living for 30 years in Mumbai & with your gross misconduct I have made it a resolve that until such people as you are allowed to pretend to be taking care of Marathi Manus I take pratigya I won’t learn Marathi. Kya karna hai bol?”The post drew a sharp response from MNS leader Sandeep Deshpande, who posted on X: “Do business if you're a businessman; don't try to act like our father.If you insult Marathi in Maharashtra, you'll get a slap on the ear, otherwise, stay in your lane, Mehta or whoever. That's all for now.”According to police, a group of unidentified men showed up at Kedia’s office near Century Bazar in Worli on Saturday morning and began vandalising the premises. They shouted pro-Marathi slogans and praised Raj Thackeray. Stones were thrown at the office, though no injuries were reported. Five MNS supporters were later detained.Hours after the attack, Kedia posted a video on X apologising to Raj Thackeray. The caption read: “I request Raj Thackeray Ji to consider my humble submission.”Earlier in the week, Kedia had approached police after receiving threats online. He tagged the Mumbai Police and other authorities, writing: “Shri @RajThackeray threatening me by 100s of your workers is not going to make me a fluent Marathi speaker... With so much threatening around even more fear happens that if I miss speaking any word(s) improperly more violence will happen.”“Please note @CPMumbaiPolice @Dev_Fadnavis open threats of violence are being issued by @RajThackeray workers. Provide me safety. Is an Indian having any rights to dignity & safety in Maharashtra today is a question even our @HMOIndia @AmitShah ji might ponder on as well.”The episode comes on the heels of another controversy involving MNS. In Mira Road, a sweet shop owner was recently beaten by seven MNS workers for not speaking Marathi. The incident, caught on camera, led to widespread protests in the area, with many shopkeepers shutting their establishments in solidarity. The MNS workers were detained but later released after being served police notices. The party has refused to apologise.Police say further investigation is underway in the Worli case, and additional security measures remain in place around Kedia’s office.",Mumbai investor sushil kedia’s office in worli was vandalised on saturday morning by unidentified individuals allegedly linked to the maharashtra navnirman sena.

The documentation requirements of the directive, lack of due process as well as the unreasonably short timeline for the said Special Intensive Revision of Electoral Roll in Bihar further make this exercise bound to result in removal of names of lakhs of genuine voters from electoral rolls leading to their disenfranchisement,"" the petition said.ADR, on whose pleas the apex court passed multiple orders for election reform, said in its petition that SIR's requirement for citizenship documentation disproportionately affects marginalized communities, including Muslims, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and migrant workers, who may lack access to such documents.""The order issued by ECI has shifted the onus of being on the voters’ list from the State to citizens. It has excluded identification documents such as Aadhar or ration cards which further make marginalised communities and the poor more vulnerable to exclusion from voting. The Declaration as required under the SIR process is violative of Article 326 in so far as it requires a voter to provide documents to prove his/her citizenship and also citizenships of his/her mother or father, failing which his/her name would not be added to the draft electoral roll and can be deleted from the same,"" the petition said""Bihar is a state with high poverty and migration rates where many lack access to documents like birth certificates or parental records. As per estimates over 3 crore voters and more particularly from marginalized communities (such as SC, STs and migrant workers) could be excluded from voting due to the stringent requirements as mentioned in the SIR order.

PATNA/NEW DELHI: RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav led a delegation of the opposition INDIA bloc to meet Bihar’s chief electoral officer (CEO) on Friday, lodging strong objections to the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of the electoral roll.The opposition claimed the Election Commission’s current exercise is “impractical and anti-democratic”. They demanded the inclusion of Aadhaar card , ration card and MGNREGA card as valid documents for voter verification under the SIR process in Bihar.Sharing a personal experience with reporters after the meeting, Tejashwi said, “My wife’s voter ID card was made on the basis of aadhaar card. Why is the aadhaar card excluded from the list of documents required for the SIR in Bihar?” he asked.EC officials here in Delhi clarified that the Aadhaar card was kept out of the list of 11 specified documents for SIR, as Aadhaar is neither a proof of date or place of birth, nor of one's Indian citizenship. ""It just defines that the 10-fingerprints, photo and iris belong to the person in whose name the card is issued. In fact, every Aadhaar card mentions in bold that ""Aadhaar is a proof of identity and not of one's citizenship or date of birth"".EC officials also mentioned that the Trinamool Congress, in its interactions with the commission, has consistently and strongly opposed linking EPIC with Aadhaar.Tejashwi also questioned the short 25-day window to verify 8 crore voters. ""Around 4 crore voters from Bihar live outside the state. How can they return so soon to verify their bona fides?” he asked.The RJD delegation that called on the Bihar CEO comprised state president Manganilal Mandal, MPs Manoj Kumar Jha and Sanjay Yadav, former minister Alok Kumar Mehta, state spokesperson Chittaranjan Gagan, Congress state president Rajesh Ram, legislative party leader Shakeel Ahmed, Sanjay Pandey, VIP’s Mukesh Sahani, CPI-ML’s Kumar Parvez, CPI’s Ram Naresh Pandey and CPI-M’s Lalan Chaudhary.","Tejashwi prasad yadav led a delegation of the opposition india bloc to meet bihar’s chief electoral officer (ceo) on friday.

JABALPUR: In a setback to actor Saif Ali Khan and his family, who inherited Rs 15,000 crore properties owned by Bhopal's erstwhile rulers, Madhya Pradesh HC has set aside the trial court's verdict given over two decades ago, and ordered a retrial in the case.In its order passed on June 30, the single bench of HC of Justice Sanjay Dwivedi set aside the judgment and decree of the trial court which upheld Pataudis (Saif Ali Khan, his mother Sharmila Tagore and his two sisters Soha and Saba) to be the owners of the properties. It also directed the trial court to make all possible efforts to conclude and decide the matter within one year.Nawab Hamidullah was the last ruling Nawab of the princely state of Bhopal. He and his wife Maimoona Sultan had three daughters - Abida, Sajida and Rabia. Sajida married Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi and became the Nawab Begum of Bhopal. Their son, Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, former Indian cricket team skipper married Sharmila Tagore. After Nawab Hamidullah's eldest daughter Abida migrated to Pakistan, Sajida became the owner of the properties. Later, her son Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi (Tiger Pataudi, who married Sharmila Tagore) became the successor of these properties estimated to be valued at nearly Rs 15,000 crore, which were inherited by Saif Ali and his siblings.The two appeals, one filed by Begum Suraiya Rashid and others, and another by Nawab Mehr Taj Sajida Sultan and others, all heirs of late Nawab Mohammad Hamidullah Khan, said the trial court had dismissed their suits against what they called as unfair partition of royal property. In their pleas, they stated that the Bhopal district court's judgment and decree dated Feb 14, 2000 dismissed their suits unfairly. Their lawyers pleaded that the partition of his (Nawab's) personal property should have been done between them and defendants Saif Ali, Sharmila and 16 other heirs as per the Muslim Personal Law. The appellants opposed the defendants (Pataudis) for citing the certificate issued by the Govt of India on Jan 10, 1962 in favour of Sajida Begum as the sole successor of all the private properties.Justice Dwivedi said, ""The matters are remanded back to the trial court for deciding it afresh."" ""And if so required, the trial court can allow the parties to lead further evidence in view of the subsequent development and changed legal position,"" the court ordered.","Madhya pradesh hc has set aside the trial court's verdict given over two decades ago, and ordered a retrial in the case.

The pilgrims in the buses were part of a larger group of 6,979 who had left for the cave shrine in Kashmir from a base camp in Jammu.The mishap prompted a directive from J&K lieutenant-governor Manoj Sinha for comprehensive safety measures in vehicles ferrying Amarnath pilgrims. He asked officials to ensure checks at all key locations and guarantee uninterrupted availability of food and medicines along the yatra route. “By the blessings of Lord Shiva, all devotees are safe. Our priority is the safety of all pilgrims,” a govt spokesman said.The 36 injured were treated at Ramban District Hospital and discharged. Most carried on with their journey. The bus whose driver lost control was damaged and its pilgrims were shifted to another vehicle, Ramban SSP Kulbir Singh said, adding only three to four of the injured changed their mind and decided not to go further.“Most of the injuries were minor and all affected yatris were discharged after first aid,” said Ramban deputy commissioner Ilyas Khan, who had rushed with other senior officials to the spot in Chanderkote. LG Sinha spoke to Khan to provide all necessary assistance to the injured pilgrims.According to SSP Singh, the private bus that lost control was from Madhya Pradesh. “The yatra convoy had halted for breakfast at Chanderkote Langer (a community kitchen that provides free food to devotees),” SSP Singh said.Earlier in the morning, the 6,979 pilgrims had left the base camp in Jammu braving heavy rain, officials said. This is the fourth Amarnath batch since the over month-long yatra started on July 3. The 5,196 men, 1,427 women, 24 children and 332 others, including monks, left in two convoys between 3.30am and 4am amid tight security, officials said.(Inputs from Naseer Ganai in Srinagar)",The accident occurred around 7.15am after the driver of the first bus reportedly lost control due to brake failure.
