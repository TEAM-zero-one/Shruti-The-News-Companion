How it works

That cold morning on December 6, there was a quiet buzz at Hameeri Kalan Senior Secondary School in Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan. For the students, teachers, and parents gathered there, it wasn’t an ordinary day. It felt like a festival — a scholarship festival.Class 9 student Kajal, clutching her notebook, ran toward her mother, who had taken the morning off from her job as a daily wage worker. “Maa, mobile de na,” she asked, eager and out of breath. “Kai karegi?” her mother said, handing over the phone. Kajal tapped the screen, and suddenly, her face lit up. “Ho gaya! Paisa aa gaya!” she yelled. Other students looked up and quickly ran to their parents, grabbing phones, dialing numbers, and checking messages. “Mujhe bhi SMS aaya!” (Even I got a money transfer SMS), one of them shouted. Yet another student said Rs 3,600 had been credited to their account. For the teachers, and staff of nonprofit Piramal Foundation who stood watching, it was a proud moment. “It felt like a lottery. Very often, students don’t receive their scholarships even after passing out from school,” says Hameeri Kalan school vice-principal Rajkamal Kataria.In a scholarship system riddled with delays and mistrust, Digi Vritti , a small digital pilot in Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan is using real-time technology to help students get their scholarships within days, not months. Just as a FASTag gets rid of toll queues and Digi Yatra speeds up airport boarding.For Piramal Group chairman Ajay Piramal, the Digi Vritti pilot is not just about fixing delays and inefficiencies. It’s about reimagining how India delivers opportunities to its most deserving students. “The existing scholarship system faces numerous challenges. From manual verification and delays in disbursement to trust deficits among beneficiaries, deserving students are often left without timely support,” he says. Digi Vritti aims to reduce benefit delivery times from 40 weeks to under a week, using digital wallets and verifiable credentials to simplify processes and ensure transparency.Sher Singh Rajput and Shraddha Mishra of the Piramal Foundation say two schools were chosen for the pilot, Hameeri Kalan and Bajawa Suron Ka, as both had high numbers of SC/ST and marginalised students, with less than 20% of those eligible receiving scholarships over the years. The platform — powered by the Open Network for Employment and Skilling Transformation (ONEST), part of the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) framework — connects students needing scholarships with bhamashahs (donors). “It’s like Flipkart,” Rajput explains. “Buyers are matched with sellers — it’s as simple as that.” This system could scale up to include govt scholarships in the future.Every year, India sets aside over Rs 50,000 crore for scholarships and benefits to support marginalised communities — nearly a quarter of the population. Yet, much of this money goes unspent. A study by the Piramal Foundation highlights how endless paperwork and fragmented systems discourage students from even applying.Most students in India must navigate multiple portals, often without reliable internet access to apply for scholarships. Aadhaar cards or caste certificates are frequently mismatched, forcing families to make repeated trips to govt offices. Besides, for every application, one must dish out between Rs 500 and Rs 1,000. “It’s disheartening to get them to fill the forms as we never know when and whether at all the kids will receive the scholarship amount. Most of them have stopped applying altogether,” says Kisturi, a teacher at the school who manages the process.For MNREGA labourer Suman, every minute lost chasing paperwork for daughter Ronak’s scholarship means lost wages. “I’ve been waiting for her scholarship since she was in Class 6. She’s in Class 9 now. Last time, I spent almost Rs 1,000 on photocopies, bank visits, running from one office to another. That’s what I earn in 10 days of hard work,” Suman says.Digi Vritti eliminates these pain points by making the process easy (see box). It also makes scholarships easier to understand, ensuring even small grants like exam fees or skilling courses reach the right students quickly. Verification of all documents happens directly at the school, cutting through the usual layers of bureaucracy. District block education officer Manish Kumar Chahar says the best part is that students won’t have to apply repeatedly. “They’ll simply get notifications about scholarships that match their eligibility and profiles,” he says. Piramal sees this project as a model for broader reforms. “Philanthropy and technology are increasingly converging to address deep systemic challenges,” he explains. “Digi Vritti exemplifies this synergy.”","Digi vritti aims to reduce benefit delivery times from 40 weeks to under a week.

NMC is in a shambles, such a casual approach is shocking: Activist

Despite the National Medical Commission (NMC) deciding in September last year that not only doctors, but patients too can appeal to the Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB) against decisions of state medical councils , on February 21 the EMRB rejected the appeal of a patient from Punjab.Incidentally, the EMRB is totally vacant since the tenure of all members came to an end last year, raising the question of who rejected the appeal.From Sept 2020, when the NMC was constituted, hundreds of patient appeals were rejected saying that NMC Act allowed only doctors to appeal. This is despite the patients’ right to appeal being upheld by a Supreme Court order in 2002.However, the minutes of the 16th meeting of NMC held on Sept 29 last year, obtained through RTI in Jan stated: “NMC had agreed that all appeals received by EMRB will be entertained.” The minutes were approved by Dec.Further, as regards action not being taken by state medical councils on complaints filed by non-medicos even after issuance of reminders by the boards. It was decided to send a communication by EMRB to state medical councils to complete the process in a time bound manner. In case of failure by the concerned SMC to act upon, EMRB may take over the complaint matter from SMC and dispose the same. This is noted by EMRB, and board will proceed further accordingly.”Gokul Chand Aneja from Punjab’s Amritsar filed an appeal dated Jan 30 against the decision of Punjab Medical Council, in a case of alleged medical negligence which led to his wife’s death. He received a letter from NMC dated Feb 21 rejecting his appeal stating that EMRB had decided in Oct 2021, that in keeping with NMC Act 2019 , “only medical practitioners or professionals should be allowed as (sic) appeals before EMRB”.In March 2022, NMC had rejected the appeal of a patient from Haryana’s Faridabad. The letter from EMRB rejecting the appeal of Aneja appears to be a copy-paste of the letter issued in March 2022 with just a change in dates, name of recipient etc.“NMC appears to be in shambles. Who took the decision to reject an appeal when EMRB is vacant? It looks like Aneja’s appeal was rejected by some functionary in the EMRB division who just copied an earlier letter. Such a casual approach is shocking,” said Dr KV Babu, ophthalmologist and RTI activist who has been fighting since 2022 to get the right of patients to appeal restored.","National medical commission (nmc) decided in september last year that not only doctors, but patients too can appeal to the ethics and medical registration board (emrb) on february 21 the emrb rejected the appeal of a patient from punjab.

MUMBAI: Four migrant workers from West Bengal died of asphyxiation on Sunday after stepping into a basement water tank at an under-construction 40-plus-storey building in Nagpada. One worker was injured while attempting a rescue. The tank had been shut for two years, leading to accumulation of sludge and toxic gases due to past chemical treatments.Workers at the site said it was common practice to step into water tanks without safety gear, but none of them was aware of the hazardous conditions inside this particular tank. “No safety kit was provided. They should have left the tank open for a while to let the gases escape,” said Bhutan Sheikh, who was injured.At the time of going to press, police were in the process of registering four accidental death cases.

In rape case,

prosecutrix testimony

enough to convict: Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: In an over 40-year-old incident of sexual assault of a schoolgirl by her tuition teacher, Supreme Court has confirmed his guilt and sentence while ruling that courts can record conviction even in absence of injury to the prosecutrix’s private parts, when other evidence corroborates rape.The accused had argued that rape charges could not be proved as there was no injury to the private parts of the girl and alleging that the girl’s mother, a “women of easy virtue”, was making false allegations against him.Rejecting both the arguments, a bench of Justices Sandeep Mehta and Prasanna B Varale said, “Merely because in the medical evidence, there are no major injury marks, this cannot be a reason to discard the otherwise reliable evidence of the prosecutrix.”Writing the judgment, Justice Varale said, “It is not necessary that in each and every case in which rape is alleged there has to be an injury to the private parts of the victim and it depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular case. We reiterate that absence of injuries on the private parts of the victim is not always fatal to the case of the prosecution.”The bench also said that it is a settled principle of criminal jurisprudence that the evidence of a prosecutrix in a case of rape carries the same value as that of an injured witness and conviction can be made on the basis of the sole testimony of the prosecutrix.Turning to the accused’s allegation about the character of prosecutrix’s mother, the bench said the court need not go into its veracity as it has no bearing on the case. “We find no reason to accept the contention that the alleged immoral character of the mother of the prosecutrix has any bearing on the accused being falsely roped in on the basis of a concocted story.”“The question of conviction of the accused for rape of the prosecutrix is independent and distinct. It has absolutely no connection with the character of the mother of the prosecutrix and seems to be a dire attempt at using it as a license to discredit the testimony of the prosecutrix. We find no merit in these contentions,” the bench said.The case also reflects a sad state of affairs of the three-tier judiciary system where trial courts are far more prompt in rendering decisions in criminal cases compared to constitutional courts. The incident of sexual assault by a tuition teacher is of March 1984. The trial court convicted the man in 1986. However, Allahabad high court took 26 years to uphold the trial court verdict and SC another 15 years to do the same.When the girl went for tuition on March 19, 1984, the teacher sent out the two other girls for different works and sexually assaulted the girl after gagging her and locking the room from inside. The other two girls knocked on the door, but it was not opened. Eventually, the grandmother of the girls came and rescued the girl. When the girl’s family attempted to lodge an FIR, the inhabitants of the mohalla and family members of the accused threatened them. Despite the threats, the FIR was lodged after some delay.",Supreme court says courts can record conviction even in absence of injury to prosecutrix’s private parts.

Traffic suspended

Traffic between Manipur hills & valley remains suspended

GUWAHTI: Manipur’s restive hills resonated with disquiet on Sunday amid the silence of an indefinite shutdown called by the Kuki-Zo Council in Kangpokpi, Churachandpur, Tengnoupal, Pherzawl and other tribal-dominant areas after weekend clashes with security personnel left a Kuki protester dead and over 20 injured.The shutdown since Saturday night, supported by the Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum (ITLF), was called in protest against the crackdown on Kuki tribals opposed to the resumption of civilian traffic between the hills and the valley after more than 18 months. The Kuki-Zo Council and ITLF are also sticking to their demand for a separate administration for the hill districts.The clashes occurred in Kangpokpi when protesters tried to block vehicular movement between the valley and hills, defying home minister Amit Shah 's recent directive to restore free movement.While no violence was reported on Sunday, traffic between the hills and valley remained suspended. Protesters burned tyres and blocked roads with boulders and makeshift barricades, all of which were cleared by security forces.“The Centre’s decision to allow free movement of Meiteis through the Kuki-Zo area led to the agitation in Kangpokpi. Security forces used excessive force on the protesters… ITLF extends its deepest respects to Lalgouthang Singsit, who sacrificed his life, as well as to everyone who suffered injuries. We respect everyone who came out to protest for the cause of our people yesterday,"" ITLF said. “Govt may take our lives, but they can never take away our freedom and rights,” the forum said, urging the Kuki-Zo community to remain united.Protesters allowed only emergency traffic through the hill districts. Additional security forces were deployed at Gamgiphai, the gateway to Kangpokpi, and other locations in the district where clashes broke out Saturday. Forces also patrolled NH-2 to ensure unrestricted vehicle movement. Manipur Police wrote on X that 27 security personnel were injured in Saturday’s clashes, with two of them in a critical condition.“Security forces showed tremendous restraint while trying to control the unruly and violent mob and used minimum force to control and counter the anti-social elements, including firing by armed miscreants from among the protestors,” the post said.“Further, it is to clarify that claims made in press releases of Kuki-Zo Council and Kuki Students’ Organisation dated March 8, 2025, that security forces were escorting local protesters are totally baseless.”A Manipur State Transport Corporation bus, four LPG containers and three oil tankers were escorted through the Imphal-Bishnupur-Churachandpur and Churachandpur-Bishnupur-Imphal routes. On Saturday, a mob in Kangpokpi district pelted a bus with stones.","Kuki-zo council in kangpokpi, churachandpur, tengnoupal, pherzawl and other tribal-dominant areas shut down.

""The leadership of Gujarat, the workers of Gujarat, the district presidents (Congress) of Gujarat, the block presidents, there are two types of people in them, there are divisions.

He was told Hindus would get angry if he said anything against the RSS. ""The Sangh does not represent the Hindus. It only misleads and exploits the Hindus in the name of religion,"" Digvijaya said adding that the Hindus have Shankaracharyas as their leaders. ""The tradition of Shankaracharyas, the Hindu spiritual leaders, has been established for thousands of years and continues to this day. Which of these Shankaracharyas support @BJP4India and @RSSorg today?"" said the Congress MP.The BJP dismissed Rahul Gandhi's statement and said he should first understand that he is responsible for the party's defeat.

Officials confirmed on Saturday that the agency is working closely with the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) to dismantle these operations, PTI reported.The move comes after the recent arrest of Kannada actress Ranya Rao, who was caught carrying 14.2 kg of gold worth Rs 12.56 crore at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport . Two CBI teams have been dispatched to Mumbai and Bengaluru airports to collect further information.Ranya Rao, known for her roles in Kannada films like Maanikya and Pataki, was detained by the DRI upon her arrival from Dubai on March 3. Authorities allege that she was attempting to smuggle 17 gold bars, weighing 14.8 kg, into the country. She was produced before a special court for financial offences on March 4 and has been remanded in judicial custody until March 18. The court has permitted her to meet her lawyer for half an hour each day and has instructed officials to ensure she is provided with basic necessities.Following her arrest, an image of Ranya with swollen eyes and bruises circulated on social media, sparking speculation of possible assault during custody, as per news agency PTI. Karnataka State Commission for Women Chairperson Nagalakshmi Chaudhary addressed the concerns but stated that the commission could not investigate unless a formal complaint was filed. She condemned any potential mistreatment, adding that no one has the right to take the law into their own hands.The case has also brought renewed scrutiny to the misuse of airport protocol services. Reports suggest that certain privileges meant for high-ranking officials were exploited to facilitate gold smuggling. In response, the Karnataka government has decided to revise standard operating procedures, restricting protocol services strictly to officials themselves, rather than their family members or associates. Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Umashankar SR confirmed the decision, stating that security measures would no longer extend to relatives of senior bureaucrats.Meanwhile, sources indicate that a protocol staffer at Kempegowda International Airport was briefly detained by the DRI after Ranya’s arrest. However, he was later released after stating that he had been instructed to receive a senior officer’s daughter and was unaware of the smuggling attempt.In a voluntary statement to the DRI, Ranya admitted to possession of the gold, acknowledging that 17 gold bars were recovered from her. She described herself as an artist, wildlife photographer, and real estate freelancer in Dubai.

How 'variability in data' affected the water quality report?



What did the previous report say?



How UP government reacted to the report?



NEW DELHI: The Central Pollution Control Board in its new report has said that water quality in the recently concluded Maha Kumbh was ""fit for bathing"". This comes after the board had termed water in Prayagraj at several locations during Kumbh unfit for bathing due to high faecal bacteria levels.In the new report dated February 28, the pollution control board said that a statistical analysis was required due to inconsistencies in the data, as water samples taken from the same locations on different dates—and from different spots on the same day—varied significantly. As a result, the findings did not accurately represent the overall water quality across the entire river stretch.""There is a significant variability in the values on various parameters, viz pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and fecal coliform count (FC) for the samples taken from the same location on different dates. The values of the afore-mentioned parameters also vary at different locations for the samples collected on the same day,"" the report said.The report clarified that an expert committee analyzed the issue of data variability and concluded that the findings represent only a snapshot of water quality at a specific location and time.It highlighted that water quality can fluctuate significantly due to various factors, including human activities upstream, flow rate, sampling depth, time of collection, river currents, mixing of currents, and the exact sampling location, among other influences.""As a result, these values reflect water quality parameters at the exact time and place from where these water samples were collected, and may not fully represent the overall characteristics of the river, therefore, not necessarily reflecting the overall river water quality throughout the river stretch,"" it said.The previous report, submitted on February 17, said that water quality at several locations in Prayagraj during Kumbh did not meet primary bathing standards due to high faecal coliform levels.""A large number of people bathe in the river at Prayagraj during the Maha Kumbh Mela, including on auspicious bathing days, which eventually leads to an increase in faecal concentration,"" the report had said, adding ""The river water quality was not conforming to the primary water quality for bathing with respect to faecal coliform at all the monitored locations on various occasions.""The UP CM Yogi Adityanath had rejected the faecal bacteria in Sangam waters claim and had said that the Kumbh was fit for bathing. He had also called it an attempt to defame the religious gathering.""Questions are being raised about the quality of the water (at Triveni). All the pipes and the drains in and around Sangam have been taped and the water is being released only after purification. The UP Pollution Control Board is continuously monitoring the water to maintain its quality,"" he had said.""The reasons for increased faecal coliform can be several, such as sewage leakage and animal waste, but the amount of faecal coliform in Prayagraj is, as per the standards, less than 2,500 MPN per 100 ml. This means that the false campaign is only to defame the Maha Kumbh. The NGT has also said that the faecal waste was less than 2000 MPN per 100 ml,"" he added.","The central pollution control board in its new report has said that water quality in the recently concluded maha kumbh was ""fit for bathing"" this comes after the board had termed water in prayagraj at several locations during kumbh unfit for bathing due to high faecal bacteria levels.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118817742,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-200990,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

How Manipur spiraled back to violence?

NEW DELHI: Day-to-day life came to a standstill in the Kuki-dominated areas in Manipur on Sunday after a retaliatory indefinite strike was enforced against the ""crackdown by security forces."" Although no fresh violence has been reported, the situation in the state's Kangpokpi district remained calm but tense.This comes a day after at least one person died while 40 were injured in clashes between Kuki demonstrators and security forces protesting free movement along all roads in the ethnic strife-torn state.In Manipur's Kuki-dominated areas in Churachandpur and Tengnoupal, protestors burnt tyres and blocked roads with boulders. The roads were, however, cleared later by the security forces.Meanwhile, shops and other business establishments remained closed and few vehicles were seen plying the roads in Kuki-dominated areas in the state. Protestors also asked locals to remain indoors.Additional security forces have been deployed in Gamghiphai and other parts of the district along the NH-2 (Imphal-Dimapur Road) and vehicular patrolling was being conducted to ensure law and order, a district official said.The state police recovered weapons, ammunition, explosives, and various military-grade equipment during security force operations on March 7.Manipur Police in a press release shared the details, ""Search operations and area domination were conducted by security forces in the fringe and vulnerable areas of hill and valley Districts.""""One SMG Carbine with one empty Magazine, One Single Bolt Action Rifle, One .303 modified Rifle, One local made Single Barrel, One .22 Rifle, two Revolver cartridge box containing 12 live round each, five of .36 HE grenade Indian made, One Walkie Talkie wireless set, one Chinese grenade, one MK 2 Grenade, One Tube Launching IA, 14 Tear Smoke Shell , One 38 mm cartridge Anti-Riot with Rubber bullet, One Smoke Shell (Chilli), one Stun Shell (Normal), One Bullet Proof Helmet, two Rice bags, one Cotton cloth mix colour (red and white), four black polythene from Sekmaijin Hangul under Hiyanglam-PS, Kakching District on March 07,"" Manipur police said in a statement.""Two 81mm country made Pumpi motor, two 51 mm country made Pumpi Gun, two country made motor bomb, nine INSAS empty case, seven SLR-empty case, two SBBL-empty case, Cortex wire -8m, one Baofeng set (unserviceable), Telescopic sight with cover from general area of Thawai Kuki village under Litan-PS, Ukhrul District,"" it added.On Saturday, the Kuki Zo council imposed a shutdown and called upon the Centre to ""reconsider its stance to avoid further escalation of tension"".""It is crucial for the central government to address the underlying issues to prevent further unrest and protect public safety. The Kuki-Zo Council urges the government to reconsider its stance to avoid further escalation of tension and violent confrontation,"" it said.""We cannot guarantee free movement of Meiteis across buffer zones and cannot take responsibility for any untoward incidents,"" it added.The Indigenous Tribal Leaders' Forum (ITLF), a Kuki-Zo body, extended support to the indefinite shutdown called by Kuki Zo Council (KZC) in all areas inhabited by the community in Manipur to protest the crackdown of security forces on demonstrators protesting free movement along all roads in the ethnic strife-torn state.In a statement, ITLF said, ""Yesterday, the Government of India's decision to allow the movement of Meiteis through Kuki-Zo areas led to agitation and protest in Kangpokpi... the security forces used excessive force on the protesters.""Endorsing the indefinite shutdown called in all Kuki-Zo areas, ITLF asked everyone to ""adhere to the shutdown in solidarity"".""We respect everyone who came out to protest yesterday,"" the ITLF said.Manipur Police, in a statement, said 27 security personnel were injured in the attacks by the Kuki protesters who pelted them with stones, and barricaded roads by putting up huge boulders, setting tyres on fire and felling trees.""Amid the protests, there were incidents of firing from amongst the protesters towards the security forces, to which the security forces retaliated,"" the statement said.""Due to heavy pelting of stones, use of catapults and random firing by armed miscreants from amongst the protesters, 27 security forces personnel suffered injuries, including two critical injuries,"" it said.""The security forces showed tremendous restraint while trying to control the unruly and violent mob and used minimum force to control and counter the anti-social elements. During the skirmish, 16 protesters were reportedly injured and one protester succumbed to injuries,"" it said.Security forces clashed with the protestors opposing Amit Shah's ""free movement"" directive and march by the Federation of Civil Society (FOCS), a Meitei body. The demonstrators set fire to several private vehicles while attempting to block a state transport bus traveling from Imphal to Senapati district. They also burned tyres along NH-2 (Imphal-Dimapur highway) and gathered on the roads to obstruct the movement of state government vehicles.""We are just following orders. We have been told to stop the march. If they want to go, they can go in the state buses arranged by the government,"" a policeman said.Police arrested seven members of four banned outfits in separate operations, officials informed. This comes a day after two cadres of the proscribed Kangleipak Communist Party (PWG) were apprehended in Lamphel, Imphal West district, while another member of the same outfit was caught near the gate of Bir Tikendrajit international airport, a senior officer reported.The arrested individuals were identified as Moirangthem Jiban Singh (27), Laishram Tiken Singh (40), and Thoudam Premkumar Singh (38). Authorities also recovered Rs 50,000 from those held in Lamphel. ""These members of the militant group have been identified as Keisham Naocha alias Ningsingba (38) and Ningthoujam Sanjoy (18) and handed over to the local police for necessary legal actions,"" an officer said. Additionally, on Thursday, security forces arrested two members of the banned Kanglei Yaol Kanna Lup (KYKL) near the Lokchao River along the India-Myanmar border in Tengnoupal district.According to the police, fra esh spell of violence began when a Manipur State Transport bus, traveling along the Imphal-Kangpokpi-Senapati route, was targeted by a mob at Gamgiphai in Kangpokpi district. The crowd started pelting the vehicle with stones, prompting security forces to deploy tear gas and use minimal force to disperse the protesters.The protest was also directed against a peace march organized by the Federation of Civil Society (FOCS), a Meitei organization. The procession, which involved over 10 vehicles, was stopped by security forces at Sekmai before it could reach Kangpokpi district. Police stated that the procession was halted because the organizers did not have the necessary permission.On March 1, Union home minister Amit Shah had instructed security forces to ensure free movement of people across all routes in Manipur starting from March 8. He also emphasized that strict action should be taken against those obstructing this movement.This directive was particularly significant, as uninterrupted travel throughout the state had been severely impacted since ethnic violence erupted between two communities in May 2023. The violence resulted in the deaths of over 250 people and displaced thousands.On February 13, the Centre imposed President's rule in Manipur following the resignation of Chief Minister N. Biren Singh, which led to political instability in the northeastern state.The Manipur Assembly, which is set to serve until 2027, has been put under suspended animation, as confirmed by a notification from the Ministry of Home Affairs.On February 20, Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla urged the people of the state to voluntarily surrender looted and illegally held weapons within seven days, assuring that no punitive action would be taken against those who returned arms during this period. The deadline was later extended until 4 p.m. on March 6, in response to demands from people in both hill and valley areas for more time.","The state police recovered weapons, ammunition, explosives, and various military-grade equipment during security force operations on march 7. On saturday, the kuki zo council imposed a shutdown and called upon the centre to ""reconsider its stance to avoid further escalation of tension"" the indigenous tribal leaders' forum (itlf), a kuki-zo body, extended support to the shutdown.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118821277,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1460760,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

CUTTAK: Orissa high court has acquitted a 42-year-old murder convict, out on bail after 14 years in jail, due to insufficient evidence .A bench of justices Sangam Kumar Sahoo and Chittaranjan Dash in its March 7 judgment set aside a 2008 life sentence given to Madan Kanhar by a sessions judge in Phulbani district for the murder of a 20-year-old woman in 2005. In 2008, Kanhar had appealed in HC, which granted him bail in 2019.The woman had gone to collect firewood in a jungle near her village in Phulbani but did not return. Her mother found her dead in the jungle on April 12, 2005, with injuries on the head and other parts of the body. Kanhar, a resident of the same village, was held primarily as the deceased had picked up a quarrel with him a few days ago.“Discrepancies in eyewitness testimony, inconsistencies in discovery of evidence, and the inconclusive forensic findings collectively fail to establish an unbroken chain of circumstances leading solely to the appellant’s guilt,” HC said. According to the bench, “while the postmortem report confirmed the homicidal nature of death, it does not conclusively link the appellant (Kanhar) to the crime”. “The testimony of the supposed eyewitness lacks the sterling quality required for unassailable reliance,” the HC said. The judges said “in the absence of unimpeachable and irrefutable evidence, the benefit of doubt must necessarily go to the appellant, as no conviction can be sustained on mere suspicion or weak circumstantial evidence”.“The administration of justice demands nothing less than proof beyond reasonable doubt, and in its absence, the appellant’s culpability remains unproven,” the bench observed.Kanhar’s advocate Jambeswar Pati said his client had been making a living as an agricultural labourer since being released on bail six years ago.","Madan kanhar was given a 2008 life sentence for the murder of a 20-year-old woman in 2005.

VIZIANAGARAM : A TDP Lok Sabha member from Andhra Pradesh has pledged to dole out Rs 50,000 for every third child who turns out to be a baby girl in his constituency.Vizianagaram MP K Appala Naidu said he will deposit the money in favour of the newborn girl child in the form of a fixed deposit, which could compound up to Rs 10 lakh by the time she is of marriagable age. “If the third child is a boy, we will give a cow and a calf. Will make a fixed deposit of Rs 50,000 if the third child is a baby girl. The Indian population has to rise,” Appala Naidu said on Sunday.The parliamentarian said he was inspired by the calls given by CM N Chandrababu Naidu to raise the country’s population. During his visit to Delhi in March, Naidu had voiced concerns over the declining population in south India, saying its ageing population poses challenges, whereas states like UP and Bihar have a younger demography. Naidu announced on Saturday that maternity leave will be granted for all women employees irrespective of the number of children they have.Promising to extend this offer to every woman in his constituency, Appala Naidu recalled he was encouraged by several women in politics and life, including his mother, wife, sisters and daughter. Further, he said encouraging women is also the need of the hour as they go through discrimination.

KOLLAM: CPM’s state conference on Sunday unanimously re-elected M V Govindan as the party’s secretary of the Kerala unit. Unlike a decade ago, there was no factional dissent in the conference, with all members in the official panels getting elected unopposed.Only those in the good books of CM Pinarayi Vijayan , the de-facto leader of both the govt and the party in Kerala, figured in the panels.Addressing a meeting at the end of the four-day state conference, Vijayan rejected as “far-fetched and unfounded” the criticism against the new pathways suggested by him towards a new Kerala. He said CPM decided to accept string-free private capital long ago. However, the party could pursue the same only now due to lack of a supporting mechanism to attract such large-scale investment in the past.Justifying the proposals he made in the document, Navakeralathinte Puthuvazhikal (New Pathways to a Renewed Kerala), which the state conference adopted without much resistance, Vijayan said the nearly nine years of continuous LDF governance significantly improved the facilities and environment, pivoting on which Kerala can achieve new heights in the coming days. The measures suggested in the document include public-private participation for revival of loss-making PSUs , cess, and differential fees for govt services.“BJP govt at Centre wants to block development activities in Kerala.

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin Sunday decided to send senior DMK functionaries to meet chief ministers and senior politicians from seven states, including BJP-governed Odisha, to rally support for his campaign against Centre’s proposed delimitation exercise.At a meeting with DMK MPs, Stalin assigned responsibility for each of the seven states. Tamal Nadu IT minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan will engage with Kerala politicians, while DMK MP Kanimozhi Karunanidhi will head a delegation to West Bengal. State PWD minister E V Velu has been tasked with meeting politicians of Andhra Pradesh while industries minister TRB Rajaa will head for Odisha.Similar delegations will be sent to AAP-governed Punjab and Congress-run Telangana and Karnataka.Stalin had last week written to the CMs and other key politicians of these seven states, explaining TN govt’s position against population-based delimitation. Calling it “an unfair exercise”, Stalin had said the Centre’s plan was a “blatant assault on federalism , punishing states that ensured population control and good governance by stripping away our rightful voice in Parliament”.With the Parliament session set to begin on Monday, Stalin has also instructed DMK MPs to raise in the two Houses key issues, including opposition to Hindi imposition, objections to the National Education Policy, and the demand for pending funds for Tamil Nadu.Three resolutions were passed at the DMK meeting at Anna Arivalayam: to safeguard Tamil Nadu’s parliamentary representation by raising the delimitation issue in Parliament, unite all the states that successfully implemented population control measures which were likely to be affected by the delimitation exercise and work with other MPs from the INDIA bloc and other democratic forces to uphold states’ rights in the delimitation process.","Stalin assigned responsibility for each of the seven states.
