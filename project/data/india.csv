"All 7 NCP MLAs in Nagaland merge with NDPP, give CM Rio absolute majority in assembly",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/all-7-ncp-mlas-in-nagaland-merge-with-ndpp-give-cm-rio-absolute-majority-in-assembly/articleshow/121545081.cms,".

All seven Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLAs in Nagaland joined the ruling Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP), giving the Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio-led party an absolute majority in the 60-member assembly.With this merger, the NDPP's tally increased from 25 to 32. NCP emerged as the third-largest party in the 2023 assembly elections, after the NDPP and its ally BJP, which won 12 seats.Addressing a press conference on Saturday, Nagaland Government Spokesperson KG Kenye said that the NCP, the third-largest group in the state assembly with 7 members, has formally merged with the NDPP.""We have been joined by a few more friends in the NDPP party force this evening; there are 9 groups in the state assembly this time and out of that, the NCP party is the third largest group in the state assembly with 7 members,"" said Kenye, who is also a minister in the state.The Speaker of the House has accepted the merger application. As a result, the NDPP's strength in the state assembly has increased from 25 to 32 members.Kenye emphasised that this development will strengthen Chief Minister Dr Rio's leadership and enhance the government's ability to serve the people.He clarified that coalition seat-sharing arrangements are not permanent and may be reconsidered in future elections.On the ministerial reshuffling, he stated that it falls under the Chief Minister's prerogative.Addressing the reason behind the merger move, he explained that national parties like the NCP face constraints in addressing state-specific issues. The move was motivated by the desire for a more state-focused political approach.He pointed out that the merger was influenced by both political necessity and the leadership appeal of the current government and NDPP leaders.Apart from 32 NDPP and 12 BJP MLAs, the state assembly has five NPP legislators, two members each of the LJP (Ram Vilas), Naga People's Front and RPI (Athawale, a JD (U) MLA and four independents.","All seven nationalist congress party (ncp) mlas in nagaland joined the ruling nationalist democratic progressive party (ndpp) ncp emerged as the third-largest party in the 2023 assembly elections, after the ndpp and its ally bjp, which won 12 seats.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121545129,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-28278,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

You and any order given by you are greater than God. If you are there then I have everything. I just need your trust and love and nothing else,” Tej Pratap posted on X, formerly Twitter. “Papa, if you were not there then this party would not have been there and neither would greedy people like Jaichand who do politics with me.

The decision followed a controversial Facebook post by Tej Pratap in which he revealed a 12-year-long relationship with a woman named Anushka, a post he later said was the result of his account being “hacked.”“Ignoring moral values in personal life weakens our collective struggle for social justice,” Lalu had written in his own X post on May 26.“The actions, public conduct, and irresponsible behavior of my eldest son are not in accordance with our family’s principles. Therefore, under these circumstances, I am removing him from the party and the family.”Lalu added that while his son is “capable of judging what is right or wrong in his personal life,” those choosing to associate with him should do so at their own discretion.Reacting to the development, Tejashwi Yadav, Tej Pratap’s younger brother and RJD’s key face in Bihar, stated that the party maintains a clear boundary between personal and political conduct. “We cannot tolerate such things. If it's about my big brother, political life and personal life are different. He has the right to make his personal decisions,” he told the media.The family dispute reignited public attention on Tej Pratap’s past, including his failed marriage with Aishwarya Rai, granddaughter of former Bihar chief minister Daroga Rai.

KOLKATA: In what otherwise seemed like a perfect kidnapping of a trader for ransom, the panic-stricken wife's unwitting transfer of part of the money via UPI to one of the kidnappers proved to be their Achilles' heel, landing them behind bars in Kolkata on Saturday.Five kidnappers had abducted Timir Kanti Majumder, a trader from South 24 Parganas district's Kulpi, Wednesday from near Netaji Bhavan Metro station in Kolkata, where he had gone for some bank work. They kept him captive in an 11th-floor flat of a condominium on SC Mullick Road, near Jadavpur's Sulekha area.The accused used Majumder's phone to contact his wife via WhatsApp call, demanding a ransom of Rs 10 lakh, which was later negotiated down to Rs 5 lakh. Panicked upon receiving the ransom calls, the victim's wife told the kidnappers she needed time to arrange the money. As a token amount, she sent Rs 10,000 via UPI to one of the accused, Suman Bose, police said.The UPI transaction gave police a breakthrough, leading to the arrest of all five accused within four hours of the rescue operation. ""We located Bose near Sukanta Setu. He was nabbed and questioned extensively before he led us to the flat inside the Jadavpur condo.He also helped us locate the victim,"" said an investigating officer.""The main hurdle in the investigation was locating any suspect, as neither the complainant, Majumder's wife Tapasi, nor her family could provide any leads. The suspects weren't using their own mobile phones,"" said DC Priyabrata Roy. The accused had kept their phones switched off and used the victim's device to place ransom calls over a WiFi network.Police have booked accused Sajal Bose (43), Sudip Mazumder (39), Suman Bose (51), Samir Kumar Deb (51), and Sandipan alias Chima Das (39), for kidnapping for ransom, said Joint CP (Crime) Rupesh Kumar.""It seems a dispute over financial transactions led to the trader's kidnapping. The accused claimed the victim owed them lakhs of rupees. However, the complainant denies this, saying Majumder was tricked in a business venture. What is clear is that the accused and the victim knew each other,"" said another officer.","Timir kanti majumder, a trader from south 24 parganas district's kulpi, was abducted wednesday.

In the last 24 hours alone, 685 new cases were recorded, and four deaths were reported, one each in Delhi, Kerala, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh.Health officials maintain there is no reason for alarm. “The severity of infections is low, with most patients under home care,” an official source told news agency PTI.Dr Rajiv Behl, Director General of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said on Monday that genome sequencing from affected regions in the west and south of India confirmed that the variants driving the latest increase are all Omicron subvariants — LF.7, XFG, JN.1, and NB.1.8.1. “We should monitor and be vigilant, but there is no cause to worry,” he said.The rise in active cases is most pronounced in Kerala (1,336), followed by Maharashtra (467), Delhi (375), Gujarat (265), Karnataka (234), West Bengal (205), Tamil Nadu (185) and Uttar Pradesh (117).Delhi reported the death of a 60-year-old woman who had acute intestinal obstruction, while Karnataka reported a 63-year-old cancer patient who had co-morbidities including tuberculosis.Odisha health secretary Aswathy S urged residents not to panic, assuring that all seven patients in the state are stable and the situation remains under control. “The latest ICMR report says that the present variant does not exhibit severe symptoms, and most cases are mild,” she said.Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta has reiterated that the city’s hospitals are well-prepared. “Nineteen patients are hospitalised in Delhi, but there is no need to worry. The government is alert,” she said. An earlier advisory instructed hospitals to ensure the availability of beds, oxygen, antibiotics, and vaccines.As active cases continue to rise in Karnataka, the state’s health and family welfare department has issued a detailed advisory aimed at preventing further spread.Healthcare workers have been directed to report all Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) cases, especially those with co-morbidities. A portion of these cases will undergo RT-PCR testing, and symptomatic individuals among vulnerable groups — including children, the elderly, and pregnant women, must be tested.The advisory also mandates the tracking of positivity rates and CT values, genome sequencing of severe cases, and sewage surveillance where applicable.With schools set to reopen in June, a separate circular instructed schools to send symptomatic children home and ensure that teachers and staff do not work while ill. “Avoid crowded or poorly ventilated areas, especially for immunocompromised individuals,” the circular said.","India's active covid-19 cases have crossed the 3,000 threshold.

Kolkata Police: ‘Legal procedures followed’

Suvendu Adhikari slams arrest as 'appeasement politics'

NEW DELHI: A 22-year-old Instagram influencer, Sharmishtha Panoli, on Saturday was remanded to 14-day judicial custody after she was arrested by Kolkata Police for allegedly making communal remarks in a social media video. The law student, originally from Kolkata’s Anandapur area and currently enrolled at a Pune-based university, was apprehended in Gurugram on Friday night after reportedly evading multiple police summons.The video in question featured Panoli criticising Bollywood actors for their silence on Operation Sindoor , as per police sources cited by news agency. The post went viral and triggered a wave of backlash, prompting her to delete the video and issue an apology. However, by then, a formal complaint had been filed in Kolkata and legal proceedings had commenced.Panoli was produced in a Kolkata court on Saturday, where her bail plea was rejected and she was remanded to judicial custody until June 13,reported. She has been charged under several sections related to promoting enmity between groups and causing religious disharmony.In response to online speculation about the legality of the arrest, Kolkata Police issued a statement clarifying that all due process was followed.“In reference to Garden Reach Police Station Case No. 136 dated 15.05.2025, certain social media narratives suggesting an unlawful arrest of a law student are factually incorrect and misleading,” the statement read. “All legal procedures were duly adhered to.

A competent court then issued an arrest warrant, and she was apprehended lawfully from Gurugram. ”The statement added that she was produced before a magistrate and granted transit remand as per legal norms.Reacting to the arrest, BJP leader and West Bengal Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari accused the state government of selective action.“FIRs were filed against Mahua Moitra for derogatory remarks about Goddess Kali.

All seven bodies were recovered this morning,” said East Kameng Superintendent of Police Kamdam Sikom on Saturday.In a separate incident, two labourers were buried alive in a cabbage field in Lower Subansiri district on Saturday after a landslide hit the area where they were working.Meanwhile, in Upper Subansiri district’s Daporijo town, flash floods triggered by the overflowing Sigin river damaged over 117 houses. Authorities have issued prohibitory orders in several vulnerable areas to prevent further casualties.In Manipur, heavy rainfall has led to city-wide flooding in Imphal, affecting hundreds of homes and disrupting road traffic. Chief Secretary Prashant Kumar Singh said that emergency services and municipal departments were on high alert.The Indian Army deployed eight rescue columns to assist the civil administration.

The Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) confirmed that the incidents were reported from multiple locations including Noonmati, Kahilipara, and Hengerabari.Tree falls, road blockages, and power outages were reported across the city, leading to panic and severe traffic congestion.“We are keeping a close watch and have mobilized our emergency response teams,” said an ASDMA spokesperson.Sikkim has been placed under red alert as continuous rainfall over the past week has sharply raised the water level in the Teesta river. The state’s Emergency Operations Centre said landslides were reported from Mangan, Gyalshing, and Soreng districts.Although no casualties have been reported so far, district officials have asked people in low-lying and landslide-prone areas to remain cautious and prepare for possible evacuations.According to the IMD, the ongoing heavy rainfall in the Northeast is due to a combination of a depression over Bangladesh and a western disturbance approaching northwest India. The IMD warned of “extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places” accompanied by thunderstorms and lightning.Disaster management authorities in all affected states have ramped up relief efforts, cleared road blockades, and opened relief camps. People are being urged to avoid venturing near rivers, landslide-prone hillsides, and waterlogged streets.“The situation remains critical. We are coordinating with local administrations for timely response and relief,” said an NDMA official.","Landslides and floods reported from at least 10 districts including aizawl, lunglei, kolasib, mamit, champhai, and serchhip.

POONCH: Shells screamed through the early morning darkness of May 7, tearing through homes and lives in Poonch district, close to the LoC in J&K. At Sukha Kattha, a cluster of small homes on a mountainside, Javid Iqbal’s five-year-old daughter Mariyam lay in his lap, her stomach ripped open by shrapnel. “She died in my arms,” he said on May 30, showing her photo, voice choked. His eight-year-old daughter Iram Naaz was wounded too.In another part of the district, at Jamia Zia-ul-Uloom, a 52-year-old seminary that doubles as a boarding school, Qari Mohammad Iqbal had just started his day. A shell exploded near an under-construction building beside his room, sending metal splinters flying. Four students were wounded. Qari Iqbal, a 46-year-old Quran teacher, was declared dead on arrival at the district hospital.As bombs rained on Poonch for three days, 14 civilians lost their lives, including students, religious teachers, shopkeepers, homemakers, and former soldiers. Over 65 were wounded — many with life-altering scars.Panic spread faster than the blasts. Families fled, streets emptied, The district fell silent under fear.“Not even in 1965 did we witness this kind of bombardment,” said Zulfikhar Ali, a shopkeeper in Poonch town’s main market. “Everyone who could afford to leave, left.”From May 6 night to May 10, five shells landed outside BJP functionary Pradeep Sharma’s home. “It began at 1.45 am and didn’t stop for days,” Sharma said. “Doctors worked tirelessly, but if we had ventilators, we might have saved six to eight more. We need a trauma hospital here, a govt medical college.”Sharma said 80% of Poonch fled by May 10. He demanded bunkers for every household and government jobs, not just for families of the dead but also for those wounded in the shelling. “Thirty-five of them have lifelong wounds,” he said. “They’re living with trauma too.”Amid loss and grief, another wound cut deep — one of defamation. Hours after Qari Iqbal’s death, Delhi-based news channels flashed his photo on screen, calling him a Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist killed in Operation Sindoor.At Jamia Zia-ul-Uloom on May 30, his brother Farooq Ahmad sat quietly, his face sunken. “We were already mourning, and then we got WhatsApp forwards. Friends asked, ‘Why are news channels calling your brother a terrorist?’ He had a beard and a Muslim name. That was enough for them to brand him something he wasn’t. Even in death, he was humiliated.”Authorities moved quickly. Poonch police and district officials called the reports “baseless and misleading”. Legal action was threatened against any outlet or person spreading false claims. Both CM Omar Abdullah and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi visited the Jamia and were briefed about the slander.Nazira Kousar, a mother from Poonch, rushed through falling shells to the hospital on May 7. Her 14-year-old son had been wounded at the seminary. “Nothing could stop me,” she said. “He survived, but now hides under a blanket, afraid to go outside. My husband has liver disease. We can’t afford treatment.” She came back on May 30, hoping someone would listen.On May 31, Union home minister Amit Shah handed job appointment letters to the next of kin. Dalbir Singh, who lost his brother Ranjit Singh, a grocery shop owner, received one. “He never married. He was calm and lovable,” Dalbir said. “I feel the sky has fallen on us. I just want this to end.”At least five members of the local Sikh community died, including former Army officer Amarjeet Singh, homemaker Ruby Kaur, and neighbour Amreek Singh. A gurdwara wall was damaged in the shelling. As Poonch recovers from three days of unrelenting fire, scars remain — carved in stone and memory.","Shells rained on poonch district, close to the loc in j&k, for three days. 14 civilians lost their lives, including students, religious teachers, shopkeepers, homemakers, and former soldiers.

Poll What approach is more effective for handling illegal immigration? Enhance border control and monitoring Uphold legal rights and appeal processes

GUWAHATI: Assam's BJP-led government has accelerated the process of tracking down individuals declared illegal foreigners by Foreigners' Tribunals and is pushing them back into the no-man's land between India and Bangladesh.At least 49 such ""declared foreign nationals"" were pushed back from western and southern Assam on May 27 and 29, after which at least three petitioners have separately moved the Supreme Court and Gauhati HC seeking the whereabouts of their family members, suspected to have been pushed back, and a halt to the ongoing drive.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Friday that ""30,000 people, after being declared foreign nationals by various tribunals over the years, have disappeared. We have decided to speed up the process of detecting them, which was paused when the NRC was being updated.The moment we get them, we have to take action and we are working as per law"".Sarma said that in coming days there would be a lot of push-backs, and added that a declared foreigner could appeal in HC or SC. ""If one has not preferred an appeal in the higher court, his right to stay in India is forfeited. But if a declared foreigner can show that he has made an appeal, we are not disturbing him,"" he said.""If judiciary has given a stay (on the tribunal order declaring them foreigners), we are respecting the judiciary and we have allowed such people to stay,"" Sarma said.Sarma said that there were two types of illegals - people who have just come in and those who have been declared foreigners by tribunals.""The SC ordered (in Feb) that those declared foreigners and have not made any appeal should be sent back by any means. Only yesterday 35 Bangladeshis who came in a few days ago were detected near the border with Meghalaya, in Silchar, and were immediate pushed back,"" he said.On Thursday, Gauhati HC issued notice to the state government directing it to provide details of the whereabouts of two brothers who were declared foreigners by a tribunal and subsequently released on conditional bail. One Torap Ali, nephew of Abu Bakkar Siddik and Akbar Ali, claimed in his petition that his family apprehends both his uncles ""may be in danger of being illegally pushed into Bangladesh"".The two were declared foreigners by a tribunal in 2017 and sent to a transit camp in Goalpara. They were released on bail in 2020 following an SC directive that those in detention for over two years may be released on bail. They were detained by police on May 24, the petitioner submitted, and claimed that the authorities have refused to give details of their whereabouts. The court has fixed the next hearing for June 4.Similarly, SC said on Friday it would hear on Monday a habeas corpus petition filed by a 26-year-old man stating that his mother, Monowara Bewa of Dhubri, also a declared foreigner, was detained by police on May 24 and since then her whereabouts were unknown.","At least 49 such ""declared foreign nationals"" were pushed back from western and southern assam on may 27 and 29.

The accused appeared before a city court on Saturday and was remanded in police custody for two days until Monday.Police said separate arrests would be made for each of the four registered cases adding that the complainants know each other, suggesting that the first complaint may have encouraged the other three students to report their experiences with the principal.","The 40-year-old principal of a private nursing college in dwarka locality of nashik in maharashtra was arrested.

"New apprenticeship policy to link degrees, raise stipends",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-apprenticeship-policy-to-link-degrees-raise-stipends/articleshow/121544411.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Centre has proposed comprehensive reforms to revitalise the apprenticeship ecosystem. Key measures include an inflation-linked hike in stipend rates, from the current Rs 5,000-9,000 to Rs 6,800-12,300, to reduce dropout rates and attract diverse talent.The reforms also formalise Apprenticeship Embedded Degree Programmes (AEDP), enabling apprentices to earn recognised degrees alongside practical training. Additionally, the policy aims to enable global deployment of apprentices at overseas client sites and expand training delivery through digital and virtual platforms.These proposals come amid persistent structural challenges within the apprenticeship framework. An official from ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship (MSDE) said, ""The proposed stipend increase is essential to curb dropouts and make apprenticeships viable, especially in sectors like technology, manufacturing, and services where living and commuting costs can be prohibitive.""A 2022 parliamentary standing committee report recommended convergence through a unified operational and digital infrastructure.Industry participation, particularly among small and medium enterprises (SMEs), remains limited due to administrative complexity, compliance burdens, and lack of awareness. Regional disparities persist, with only 1.2% of apprentices from the North-East despite targeted benefits. Female participation, while improving, continues to lag behind overall workforce levels.Fragmentation between ministry of education and MSDE - which run National Apprenticeship Training Scheme (NATS) and Pradhan Mantri National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (PM-NAPS), respectively - has caused duplication and inefficiencies. ""We are developing a unified apprenticeship portal to integrate certification, data sharing, and employer outreach. This will simplify processes, reduce compliance friction, and improve access for both apprentices and employers,"" the official added.The 38th meeting of Central Apprenticeship Council, chaired by Jayant Chaudhary, minister of state (independent charge), MSDE, recently discussed these proposals and charted a forward-looking policy roadmap. The reforms include targeted inclusion measures for women, persons with disabilities (PwDs), and youth from the northeastern region (NER). The official noted: ""Expanding participation from under-represented groups, particularly from the North-East and PwDs, is a key priority. The pilot project launched in Mizoram, providing an additional Rs 1,500 monthly stipend to over 26,000 apprentices, highlights our commitment.""Formal regulation of AEDPs will allow apprentices to earn recognised degrees alongside hands-on training, strengthening the link between education and industry needs. ""Only 0.27% of India's workforce are apprentices, compared to 3% in the UK and Germany. Attrition rates remain high. Inflation-linked stipends and degree-linked apprenticeships will help reduce attrition and sustain a steady talent supply,"" said Nipun Sharma, CEO, degree apprenticeship, Team Lease. He also pointed out the low female participation, despite sectors like electronics manufacturing and smartphone assembly preferring female workers.On global deployment plan, the official said, ""Allowing apprentices to gain experience at overseas client sites will expose them to international standards and prepare them for a competitive global workforce.""","Centre has proposed comprehensive reforms to revitalise the apprenticeship ecosystem.

Valmik Thapar was tiger's most tireless advocate

JAIPUR: Valmik Thapar was 24 - fresh out of St Stephen's with a gold medal in sociology and an old boy from The Doon School. He stood at a crossroads. Life had questions, but no answers. Then the jungle found him. In Ranthambhore, 1976, he met Fateh Singh Rathore - the national park's legendary field director.""Once you've looked into the eyes of a wild tiger,"" Thapar would later write, ""you're never the same."" That encounter didn't just chart a career spanning 50 years, it ignited a cause that would redefine tiger conservation in India.On Saturday morning, a pall of silence fell across Ranthambhore's forests. Thapar, 73, died at his Delhi home after a prolonged battle with cancer. More than just a conservationist, Thapar was a man who walked with tigers - and also an author, documentarian, policy adviser and activist.But to many, Valmik Thapar was the tiger's most tireless advocate. His relationship with Rathore, bloomed into a decades-long partnership that not only saved Ranthambhore's tigers from vanishing but also seeded a national movement for big cat protection.""I met Valmik as a 10-year-old in 1976,"" said Goverdhan Singh Rathore, son of Fateh Singh. ""He was going through a difficult time and came to Ranthambhore seeking peace.""""That meeting with my father led to a friendship that lasted a lifetime. Both led a long-running crusade to save Ranthambhore and its tigers,"" he added.In 1987, Thapar founded Ranthambhore Foundation - one of the first efforts in India to integrate conservation with community uplift. Villages ringing the park became part of the mission.Healthcare, education, women's employment and traditional crafts were woven into a model that linked forest protection to human well-being. NGOs like Dastkar joined the effort, showing conservation didn't need to be a choice between people and animals.Dharmendra Khandal, a close associate and conservation biologist, recalled time in the field with reverence. ""With Valmik sir, it was not just a safari; it was a masterclass in the wild. His energy at 70 was unmatched. Even between safaris, he wouldn't rest - he would invite me home for long, intense conversations about Ranthambhore's future.""Thapar authored nearly 50 books, narrated documentaries including Land of the Tiger for BBC, and served on over 150 committees, including National Board for Wildlife.He was unafraid to call out missteps in govt policy, yet managed to win trust across political and bureaucratic divides. ""He was fearless. Today, he has laid down his armour and gone to eternal rest,"" said Balendu Singh, former honorary warden of Ranthambhore.To those who worked with him, Thapar was a visionary mentor - sharp, driven, and unyielding. ""His booming voice will echo through the valleys of Ranthambhore forever,"" said Goverdhan Singh.Even in his final days, Thapar was deep into writing a two-volume chronicle marking 50 years of Ranthambhore.Wildlife filmmaker Subbiah Nallamuthu, who chronicled India's tigers for global audiences, perhaps captured Thapar's impact best. ""He was the voice through which India's tigers first spoke to the world. Long before streaming platforms and social media, he gave the tiger a language that was poetic, political and proudly Indian. The tiger may have lost a voice, but for those who read his words, watched his films, and walked the trails he once did, that voice still echoes. ""Thapar leaves behind his wife Sanjana Kapoor, daughter of actor Shashi Kapoor, and a life spent tracking pawprints through history.","Valmik thapar, 73, died at his delhi home after a prolonged battle with cancer.
