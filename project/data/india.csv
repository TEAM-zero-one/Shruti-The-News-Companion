NEW DELHI: The man, who saved the 15-year-old girl from Odisha's Puri district after she was set ablaze by unidentified men, recounted the harrowing 90 minutes after she knocked on his door, screaming for help, ""save me, save me. ""A 15-year-old girl, allegedly set on fire by three masked men in Odisha’s Puri district, was transferred to AIIMS New Delhi, where she remains in stable condition with 70-75%burn injuries.The class 9 dropout was walking to a relative’s home around 8.30am Saturday when she was reportedly intercepted near a river embankment, rendered unconscious by a chemical-lacedcloth, and doused with kerosene before being set ablaze.Screaming for help, she fled to a nearby house, where Dukshishyam Senapati extinguished the flames and gave her fresh clothes.Recalling the harrowing moment, Senapati said that when he answered his door, he was stunned to find the girl engulfed in flames and crying in agony, as he later explained to DGP YB Khurania during the official's site visit.""It was around 8.30 am when the girl came to my house, screaming. With the help of my wife, I doused the fire and gave her water as she was very thirsty.Later, the women of my family changed her clothes,"" he said.Upon questioning, the girl informed Senapati that three unidentified men had set her ablaze. She explained being abducted by motorcycle-riding assailants whilst returning from meeting a friend.""She said she was walking back home after meeting a friend when she was picked up by three men who arrived on motorcycles. The faces of these men were half-covered, and they took her to a place near the Bhargavi riverbank. She could not tell their names. She could only say that they covered her face with a handkerchief and poured some substance before setting her on fire,"" he said.Senapati noticed that although the girl mentioned being bound during the abduction, her hands were free when she arrived. After learning her father's details, he contacted her family. The large crowd that gathered prevented further conversation with the victim.Despite searching the area, Senapati couldn't locate the perpetrators. He explained that the attackers fled after setting her alight, presumably expecting her to perish. However, the girl managed to escape and reach his house.Due to delayed ambulance response, they resorted to an auto rickshaw for hospital transport. The girl remained at his residence for approximately 90 minutes.The incident has created fear in the village, particularly among children who are now afraid to venture out alone. Senapati urged swift arrest of the culprits.","'girl was on fire and screaming in pain' said dukshishyam senapati.

"11,000 'not traceables' electors revealed by Bihar’s SIR could be illegal immigrants",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/11000-not-traceables-electors-revealed-by-bihars-sir-could-be-illegal-immigrants/articleshow/122802408.cms,"Photo: Generative AI

NEW DELHI: While the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral roll in Bihar is well on track with merely 32 lakh electors left to be covered, what has caught attention is the mention of 11,000 “not traceable” electors in the latest update put out by Election Commission on Saturday. Sources told TOI that electors “not traceable” during SIR are possibly illegal immigrants living outside Bihar but who were enrolled in the state with a possible intent to create scope for bogus votes.An EC functionary explained that “not traceable” electors were not just not found at their recorded addresses by the booth level officers (BLOs) but never known to have lived there even by immediate neighbours. In some cases, no house or dwelling was found at these addresses.“It is possible that they are illegal immigrants — possibly Bangladeshis or Rohingyas — who may be living in neighbouring states but somehow managed to get themselves electoral photo identity cards from Bihar, possibly due to lack of requisite checks during summary revisions or even corrupt means,” an official said, adding that this poses a risk of bogus votes being cast during elections.Nearly 41.6 lakh electors in Bihar, comprising 5.3% of its total electorate, were not found at their addresses despite three mandatory visits by BLOs; these include 14.3 lakh (1.8%) probably deceased electors, 19.7 lakh or 2.5% probably permanently shifted electors, 7.5 lakh or 0.9% electors enrolled at multiple places; and 11,000 ‘not traceable’ electors.The figure of possibly deceased electors is also intriguing, considering that their names had figured in Bihar rolls as on June 24, 2025.“The deceased voters were never removed from the list, which creates a leeway for bogus votes. Over 41 lakh missing electors, when split across constituencies, may be larger than the victory margin in some,” said an officer, justifying the need for intensive revision of rolls to detect and correct such anomalies.Accounting for 5.3% voters not found at their addresses thus far, almost 96% of Bihar’s 7.9 crore electors have turned in their enrolment forms. Nearly 88.2% of the 90.6% electors forms received so far, have been digitised.","Nearly 41.6 lakh electors in bihar, comprising 5.3% of its total electorate, were not found at their addresses despite three mandatory visits.

Driver fails breath test after eating jackfruit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/driver-fails-breath-test-after-eating-jackfruit/articleshow/122802392.cms,"Representational Photo

Kottayam: Is there a connection between jackfruit and detection of alcohol in one's breath? A breathalyser test at a Kerala State Road Transport Corporation depot in Pathanamthitta apparently found one.A bus driver who consumed jackfruit before joining duty failed a breathalyzer test at the Pandalam KSRTC depot on Friday. An official, who did not wish to be identified, said that another driver brought jackfruit harvests from his house to the depot and shared it with his colleagues. The driver in question consumed a good amount of the fruit, the official said.As routine, he then underwent the breathalyzer test. But to his shock, the meter rose from 0 to 10 within seconds. The driver insisted that he was not drunk and even challenged the authorities to conduct a blood test. Three other staff members also failed the test. Finally, the authorities concerned decided to put the breathalyzer itself under the scanner.An official who was assigned to conduct the breathalyzer test took the assessment with the meter showing zero. However, when he underwent the test after consuming jackfruit, the meter reading went up, showing he was drunk, said the official. The officials confirmed that jackfruit was the unlikely culprit.","A bus driver who consumed jackfruit before joining duty failed a breathalyzer test at the pandalam ksrtc depot on friday.

NMC again threatens action against medical colleges not paying stipend,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nmc-again-threatens-action-against-medical-colleges-not-paying-stipend/articleshow/122802244.cms,"Representative image

National Medical Commission (NMC) has yet again issued a public notice threatening to take action against medical colleges that do not pay stipends to interns and resident doctors.With no evidence of any action being taken after similar threats in 2023 and 2024, it remains to be seen whether change in chairman of the commission leads to action this time.Three months back, NMC had threatened to impose Rs 50,000 as penalty on medical colleges which save several crores of rupees every year by not paying stipend. NMC’s regulations stipulate that all medical colleges have to pay interns and resident doctors stipend equivalent to what state govt medical colleges are paying.Just three days before the latest public notice dated July 11, NMC had issued another notice shifting the responsibility of addressing grievances of medical students to medical colleges, universities and directorates of medical education of the respective states. Yet, it is now threatening to take action including imposition of financial penalties, withdrawal of course recognition and suspension of admissions.The latest notice reminded medical colleges that, in keeping with SC order of April 29, all private and deemed universities must disclose detailed information regarding tuition fees, hostel charges, caution deposits and all miscellaneous charges at pre-counselling stage. Citing another order of SC in 2022 and the commission’s own regulations, it said payment of stipend was mandatory.NMC threatened that non-compliance would attract action under Establishment of Medical Institutions, Assessment and Rating Regulations, 2023, Maintenance of Standards of Medical Education Regulations, 2023, and Post Graduate Medical Education Regulations, 2023. It added that these measures to ensure payment of stipend and for disclosure of various kinds of fees well before counselling were “a part of NMC’s commitment to fostering fair, ethical and transparent practices in medical education across the country”.In April 2023, NMC did a survey among medical college students on stipend being paid to them. An RTI query to NMC revealed the survey showed that over 60 colleges were not paying stipend, while about 50 were paying less than Rs 5,000 a month.In Aug 2023, NMC issued “an advisory” to all colleges regarding payment of stipend. With SC cracking down on NMC regarding non-payment of stipend, in Nov 2024, the commission issued show cause notices to 198 medical colleges for failing to submit stipend payment data.NMC has written to colleges threatening “strict action” in Aug 2023, Nov 2024 and now on July 11, 2025. Yet, there is no record of any action being taken against any college for non-payment of stipend till now.","Nmc’s regulations stipulate that all medical colleges have to pay interns and resident doctors stipend equivalent to what state govt medical colleges are paying.

BENGALURU: A routine ride home from school turned into a heart-wrenching tragedy for the family of a seven-year-old boy, who died after falling out of a moving school bus due to the negligence of the driver in Magadi Friday evening.The victim is L Rajat, a class 2 student at SBS School in Magadi Town and a resident of Hosapalya in Janata Colony. He is the son of Lokesh and Radha, both daily wage workers from Hanur in Kollegal. Rajat was returning home along with his 10-year-old sister Dushita in the school bus when the incident occurred.Reconstructing the sequence of events, police the brother-sister get picked and dropped off every day by the school bus driven by 35-year-old R Vinod. ""Usually, around 30 children use the school bus. A woman attendant is appointed to look after the children during the journey. Rajat and Dushita board the bus first as the bus service starts near their house. During drop off, the brother-sister duo are the last ones to deboard,"" an investigating officer said.On Friday evening, all kids got dropped and the woman attendant got off a stop before that of Rajat and Dushita.""Vinod resumed the journey with Rajat and Dushita seated near the door. The door opened as it was not properly locked. Vinod asked Rajat to close the door. As Rajat moved closer to the door, he got thrown out of the vehicle and the rear tyre ran over him,"" police said.Vinod immediately took Rajat to a nearby private hospital, but the child succumbed to his injuries, police said. The police arrested Vinod for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Normally, persons accused of causing accidental deaths are arrested for causing death due to negligence, and the accused person can walk out on station bail. However, when booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, the police have to produce the accused before the concerned court, which normally hands them over to judicial custody.""Vinod's responsibility was to ensure that the door was properly locked. He didn't check it. The second mistake was asking Rajat to close the door while the bus was moving. Vinod has been shifted to the judicial custody of Ramanagara district prison,"" an investigating officer said.","L rajat, 7, died after falling out of a moving school bus due to the negligence of the driver.

Interestingly, the SC registry has pointed out several defects in Justice Varma’s petition to advocate-on-record Vaibhav Niti, who has to race against time to get these cured and make the petition eligible for listing before a bench.Even if the petition gets cured of the defects and is listed for hearing before a bench, it would face many questions about its maintainability given the facts of the incident of March 14, the statements of first responders confirming the presence of sacks of half-burnt currency notes and the conduct of the judge as well as his private secretary after the fire incident in cleaning up the storeroom in the early hours of March 14 after police and firemen left the scene.Justice Varma raises a question as to why the police did not seize the cash and why they did not prepare a ‘panchnama’ (independent witness statements corroborating discovery of cash). For a week from March 15 till March 22, when the inquiry committee was appointed, why did Justice Varma keep silent and not register an FIR with police seeking a thorough investigation as to who planted the cash at his residence to frame him?Instead, he, in his petition, faults the inquiry committee for failing in its duty to find out how the cash came into his residence and who were the people responsible for it. It would have given credibility to his stand had he filed an FIR asking the police to find out who planted the cash and how the fire took place. But he did nothing even as evidence of burning cash was uploaded on SC website on orders of then CJI Khanna.Interestingly, a strong counter-point to Justice Varma’s plea is provided in a PIL filed by advocate Mathews Nedumpara, who said, “The presence of huge volumes of cash running into crores of rupees, that too at the official residence of a judge of Delhi HC, who decides commercial matters involving hundreds and thousands of crores, whose residence is secured 24/7 by CRPF, would lead to irresistible conclusion that the money which happened to catch fire is illegal money and the judge and the bribe giver, both, have committed offences punishable under Prevention of Corruption Act, PMLA, BNS and other laws, which render it obligatory on the part of the police to register an FIR. ”",Allahabad hc’s justice yashwant varma for quashing of an inquiry report on discovery of sacks of money in his official residence.

NEW DELHI: Holding Chanda Kochhar , former CEO of ICICI Bank , guilty of receiving bribes of Rs 64 crore through her husband from Videocon group, an appellate tribunal here in an order dated July 3 observed that the money was paid as quid-pro-quo for sanctioning a loan of Rs 300 crore to the Videocon group.“The history given by the appellants (ED) has been narrated and supported by the evidence in the light of the reference of the statements under Section 50 of the PMLA Act which are admissible and can be relied upon. The allegation made by the appellants stands because on paper ownership of NRPL is shown to be of V N Dhoot (CMD of Videocon group) but according to him also, the entire control of the company was of Deepak Kochhar (Chanda Kochhar’s husband). Thus, the allegations were made for quid-pro-quo to Chanda Kochhar for sanction of loan to Videocon group of industries,” the tribunal said in its order.The appellate tribunal slammed the adjudicating authority that had earlier in Nov 2020 given relief to the accused in releasing the attached assets worth Rs 78 crore.“The adjudicating authority has ignored the material facts while drawing the conclusions which are coming out on the face of the record and, therefore, we cannot endorse the finding of the adjudicating authority going against the record and ignoring the relevant facts.Thus, we find substance in the allegation of the appellants for quid-pro-quo to Chanda Kochhar for sanction of loan of Rs 300 crore to Videocon group and thereupon, a sum of Rs 64 crore was transferred to NRPL, a company managed by Deepak Kochhar and, in fact, he was the managing director of the said company. The factual issues narrated above clarifies that the appellants have taken up the matter to justify the attachment of the property,” the tribunal said, justifying the ED’s attachments.The tribunal noted that the sanction of a loan of Rs 300 crore by ICICI Bank to the Videocon group where Chanda Kochhar remained part of the committee was against the rules and policy of the bank. “The issue remains about the transfer of Rs 64 crore by Videocon group through its entity SEPL to NRPL day after the disbursement of loan by ICICI Bank,” it said while validating the evidence produced by the ED. The appellate tribunal also held Kochhar guilty of not disclosing her conflict of interest while sanctioning the loan.",An appellate tribunal observed that the money was paid as quid-pro-quo for sanctioning a loan of rs 300 crore to the videocon group.

NEW DELHI: The fact-finding committee constituted by the University Grants Commission (UGC) has held KIIT Deemed to be University, Bhubaneswar, responsible for the suicide of two students earlier this year, stating that ""illegal and unlawful activity by the university"" led to one of the deaths and that the administration's actions ""amount to criminal liability. ""Along with these findings, the committee has issued a set of strong recommendations, based on which the commission is contemplating a freeze on the university's expansion and departmental action against erring officials, among others. The UGC committee, chaired by Professor Nageshwar Rao, submitted its report on May 20, 2025, after campus visits, stakeholder interactions, and detailed analysis.The report cited the university's failure to act lawfully on sexual harassment complaints, inadequate hostel facilities, excessive student intake, and use of brute force on students as key failings contributing to the incidents.The committee's observations and findings include serious lapses in infrastructure and governance. It found that hostel facilities were ""substandard"" with ""three students put in a small room"" and female international students accommodated without cultural considerations. It also noted that complaints of sexual harassment were ignored or illegally compromised, that the administration forcibly removed Nepalese students without support, and that security personnel used physical aggression against students.The university, it said, prioritised its ""reputation of university over regulations, law of land and international relations of the country.""Observing that members of the internal complaints committee (ICC) and senior administrative personnel of the university ""are liable for criminal punishment as per law"", the report stated, ""... university's internal complaints committee (ICC) failed to take lawful action in reported sexual harassment cases. There was no transparency that protocols for investigation were followed. The girl had made complaints to the administration twice much before this tragic incident. In both the complaints, they decided to go for illegal compromise... The university has the power to punish the boy even when the first complaint was lodged. Instead of punishment, they favoured the boy by pushing forced illegal compromise with the girl. Later on, this has led to suicide. This suicide case could have been averted.""On Feb 16, Prakriti Lamsal, a third-year BTech student from Nepal, was found dead in her hostel room. The report also called for departmental action against ICC members who acted in violation of rules. ""Had KIIT University taken action to decide the reported harassment case as per law in the first case, the tragedy could have been avoided,"" the report stated.On May 2, another Nepalese undergraduate student was found dead in her hostel room at KIIT.","A fact-finding committee has held kiit deemed to be university, bhubaneswar responsible for the suicide of two students earlier this year.

KULLU: A woman has married two brothers in the remote trans-Giri region of Himachal Pradesh's Sirmaur district, drawing cheers from the local Hatti tribe for upholding their traditional ways.Pradeep and Kapil Negi, brothers from Shillai village, wed Sunita Chauhan of Kunhat village in a three-day ceremony that ended on July 14. The trio shared the wedding stage, danced to traditional folk music, and received blessings from village elders as hundreds of relatives and locals looked on - in a rare public affirmation of the ancient custom of polyandry.Pradeep works with Jal Shakti department. Kapil is employed in the hospitality sector overseas. Sunita is a trained technician from an industrial training institute (ITI).""This is not just a marriage - it's a moment of pride,"" said Hira Singh, a relative of the grooms. ""Our educated youth have shown the courage to embrace what many keep secret. They've set an example.""Polyandry remains a socially accepted practice among the Hatti community, which numbers about 300,000 in Sirmaur and is spread across five tehsils and 154 panchayats, including Shillai, Sangrah, Kamrau, Rajgarh, and Nohradhar.Amichand Kamal, president of Kendriya Haati Samiti said, ""Polyandry was the norm in tribal societies as it protected land holdings and avoided widowhood. A woman has more freedom-she can choose her husbands and leave them without stigma.""What made this wedding stand out wasn't the custom - but its visibility. ""Polyandry may seem primitive to outsiders, but it's legal in our context. Usually these marriages happen quietly,"" Kamal said. ""But this one was public. That makes it powerful.""The tradition was once widespread across tribal belts like Lahaul-Spiti and Kinnaur. But as nuclear families grew and youth migrated toward city jobs, the practice withered.""It has nearly vanished in Lahaul-Spiti and Kinnaur,"" said Shamsher Singh, a research scholar on folk art from Lahaul-Spiti. ""But in trans-Giri and Jaunsar-Bawar of Uttarakhand, it survives, largely because of the Mahabharata's cultural imprint.""Many Hattis believe they descend from the Kauravas or Pandavas. ""That belief still echoes in our valleys,"" Singh said. That belief is more than a custom - it's a legacy. Once in a while, that legacy walks down the aisle to a folk tune.","Pradeep and kapil negi, brothers from shillai village, wed sunita chauhan in a three-day ceremony that ended on july 14.

MEERUT: Miscreants posing as kanwariyas to incite violence and defame the pilgrimage will face strict action, including public naming through posters once the yatra concludes, UP CM Yogi Adityanath said on Sunday. He inspected arrangements and interacted with pilgrims along NH-58.He said miscreants were deliberately infiltrating groups of kanwariyas and indulging in hooliganism to tarnish the image of the yatra.“Troublemakers have resorted to defame this holy pilgrimage. We have CCTV footage of such elements. We will paste their posters after the yatra is over. Any attempt to disrupt the yatra or compromise its sanctity will be dealt with strictly,” he said.Demonstrating respect for the pilgrims’ faith, Yogi showered flower petals on kanwariyas in Meerut and from a helicopter in other districts of western UP. “From tomorrow, lakhs of Shiv devotees from various states will carry water in the form of kanwar and perform jalabhishek in various Shiv temples. I heartily welcome all the devotees bringing holy Gangajal from Haridwar,” he said.Objecting to a “media trial” of devotees, Yogi said sections of the media were portraying kanwariyas as rioters, which was an “insult to India’s heritage”.He said social media was filled with videos showing individuals in saffron creating ruckus, ransacking hotels, damaging vehicles and assaulting civilians, and claimed these were not genuine devotees but anti-social elements wearing saffron to malign the pilgrimage. “Where there is enthusiasm and excitement, faith and devotion, some people try to disturb celebrations and defame devotion and faith,” he said.“While most devotees uphold the sanctity of the yatra, some anti-social elements are conspiring to malign it. It is the responsibility of every kanwar sangh and every Shiv bhakt to expose such elements. Do not allow them to enter your circle. Immediately inform the administration if you spot such people.”Yogi urged pilgrims not to retaliate if provoked and assured that the administration was fully prepared to take legal action. “No one should take the law into their own hands. The administration is there to act if any such miscreant desecrates the yatra,” he said.He said that unlike previous govts that “created obstacles for such pilgrimages before 2017”, the current govt respected the faith of devotees. “It is our responsibility to take this tradition forward with the same sacred sentiment,” he said. The CM appealed to pilgrims to avoid littering, join cleanliness campaigns and ensure that no river or road was left dirty. “Shiv bhakts should walk with a spirit of public welfare and remain mindful of not causing inconvenience to others. ” The state, he added, had arranged for drinking water, first-aid stations, lighting, rest camps and other facilities.",Up cm yogi adityanath inspected arrangements and interacted with pilgrims along nh-58.

‘Na Bijli Aayegi Na Bill’: BJP Minister’s Dig Becomes Self-Goal in Bihar | Free Electricity

NEW DELHI: On the birthday of Nishant Kumar , son of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar , Rashtriya Lok Samta Party and Rajya Sabha MP Upendra Kushwaha sparked a political buzz by publicly suggesting it’s time for a leadership transition within the party.Taking to social media, Kushwaha, an NDA ally, extended warm wishes to Nishant and called him the ""new hope"" of Janata Dal (U). “On this happy occasion, I respectfully urge Nitish ji to acknowledge the reality that managing both the government and the party may no longer be ideal for him,” he wrote.While praising Kumar’s long administrative experience and his importance in running the state, Kushwaha appealed to him to consider handing over party responsibilities—something he claimed many in the party also believe is long overdue. “Delaying this could lead to damage that may never be repaired,” he warned.Without directly naming health or age, Kushwaha’s remarks echoed ongoing chatter about Nitish Kumar’s physical and mental capacity to continue in full leadership roles.Kushwaha added that many JDU leaders may not have the access or courage to convey such concerns directly to Nitish Kumar, which is why he felt compelled to say it openly.Interestingly, when asked about his political debut during a temple visit in Patna on Sunday, Nitish's son, Nishant Kumar, denied any plans to enter politics. Instead, he urged the people of Bihar to once again make his father the chief minister.",Nishant kumar is the son of bihar chief minister nitish kumar.

Indian Worker Kidnapped in Niger, Family Appeals to Prime Minister Modi

JAMMU: J&K CM Omar Abdullah urged Sunday the external affairs ministry (MEA) to intervene urgently in securing the release of Ranjeet Singh, a resident of Ramban district, who was allegedly abducted by terrorists in Niger following an attack on July 15.Abdullah tagged external affairs minister S Jaishankar on X and called for Centre’s intervention.Singh, employed as a senior safety officer with M/s Transrail Lighting Limited — a power transmission and distribution firm in Niger — lost contact with his family on July 15, the day terrorists struck the Dosso region, reportedly killing two Indian workers.His wife Sheela Devi, speaking from the family’s remote village of Chakka Kundi in Ramban, said she learned about the abduction from one of her husband’s friends in Niger after receiving vague responses from his company. “I kept calling the company, but they said there was no network at the site. No mention of anything serious,” said the mother of three young children.Ranjeet’s father Mohan Lal said: “He was supposed to return in a month or two. We request the PM to help us. He has three small children,” Lal said.
