A court in Belgium has rejected the bail plea of Mehul Choksi --a key accused in the Rs 13,500 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) loan fraud case. A three-judge bench heard the arguments before ruling against granting bail.Choksi was arrested in Belgium last week following an official request from Indian authorities.Meanwhile, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal had said during the weekly media briefing that India was working with the Belgian side for Choksi's extradition.""As you are aware, based on our extradition request, he was arrested in Belgium. We are closely working with the Belgian side for his extradition to India so that he can face trial in the country,"" Jaiswal had said answering a query.Earlier, Choksi's Indian lawyer, Vijay Aggarwal, was seen in Antwerp ahead of the bail hearing and had also visited Choksi in jail.After his arrest, Aggarwal had stated that the legal team planned to appeal the decision, emphasizing ""Choksi's ill health and ongoing cancer treatment"" as the primary grounds for seeking his release. ""My client, Mehul Choksi, is currently in custody. We will initiate the process of filing an appeal and request his release from prison, citing his medical condition and the fact that he is not a flight risk,"" Aggarwal told ANI.During a press conference held in Delhi, Aggarwal had outlined the defence strategy to contest Choksi's extradition on two key grounds: the political nature of the case and concerns over the treatment of Choksi's health condition in India. He had argued that extradition could severely impact Choksi's human rights, ""particularly due to the lack of adequate medical care and the risk of harassment by political entities.""Aggarwal had claimed that Choksi had been cooperative with Indian investigative agencies and had expressed willingness to participate in investigations via video conferencing due to his health issues.The legal team had also pointed out procedural prerequisites for extradition, including the issuance of non-bailable warrants since 2018. Aggarwal had noted that previous attempts to extradite Choksi from Dominica had failed, and that Choksi had been receiving medical treatment in Antigua before traveling to Belgium for cancer care.","A court in belgium has rejected the bail plea of mehul choksi.

A career cut short by family tragedy

NEW DELHI: In a shocking twist to the death of former Karnataka DGP Om Prakash, Bengaluru Police have detained his wife, Pallavi, after she allegedly threw chilli powder in his face and stabbed him to death in their HSR Layout residence.Their daughter, Kriti, has also been detained for questioning as investigators dig deeper into what appears to be a domestic dispute turned deadly.The development comes following a formal complaint filed by the deceased officer’s son, who alleged that both women had a role in the killing.According to police sources, the 68-year-old retired IPS officer was killed following a heated argument with Pallavi, who reportedly lost control and attacked him with a knife after blinding him with chilli powder, reported PTI.The murder is said to have occurred on the ground floor of their three-storeyed home on Sunday, where Prakash was found lying in a pool of blood.What makes the case more chilling is what followed: PTI sources say Pallavi made a video call to a friend immediately after the incident and declared, “I have killed the monster.”Prakash's son Kartikesh has come forward with a damning accusation that his mother Pallavi had been threatening to kill his father for a week, and that his sister Kriti pressured him to return home just two days before his death.“Due to these threats, my father had gone to stay at his sister’s house,” Kartikesh said in his police complaint. “My younger sister Kriti went there and brought him back against his will.”According to the complaint, the fatal incident came to light around 5 pm on Sunday when a neighbor alerted Kartikesh while he was at the Karnataka Golf Association. “I rushed home and found police and others already there. My father was lying in a pool of blood with injuries on his head and body. A broken bottle and a knife were found near his body,” he said, adding that his father was taken to St John’s Hospital.“My mother Pallavi and sister Kriti used to fight with my father often. I strongly suspect they are involved in his murder,” he added, urging police to take legal action.Investigators believe the murder was the result of long-standing tensions in the family, including a property dispute over land in Dandeli, Karnataka. Sources said the couple had frequent confrontations, and Pallavi had even visited the HSR Layout police station months ago to file a complaint. When her grievance wasn't taken seriously, she allegedly staged a dharna outside the police station.Pallavi is also reportedly undergoing treatment for schizophrenia and has been on medication, police sources revealed.Om Prakash, a 1981-batch IPS officer from Champaran, Bihar, had an illustrious career in the Karnataka police force. He held a Master’s degree in Geology and rose through the ranks to serve as Director General and Inspector General of Police from March 1, 2015, until his retirement in March 2017.He began his service in Ballari district as Additional Superintendent of Police and held key roles in Shivamogga, Uttara Kannada, Chikkamagaluru, the Lokayukta, and the Fire and Emergency Services.The case has sparked massive interest in Karnataka and beyond, with police sources earlier confirming the use of a weapon and visible signs of physical assault. An autopsy report is awaited, and further investigation is underway.","Former karnataka dgp om prakash, 68, was found dead in his home on sunday.

At the same time, the teams on door knocks will seek households' support through symbolic pledges to ""protect the Constitution"".The micro-level engagement is reminiscent of the ""ghar ghar guarantee"" campaign by state Congress units to take the party manifesto to voters in every household during the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, while also pushing the opposition INDIA bloc's charge of "" Constitution in danger "" against BJP.Before the door-to-door campaign in May, Congress has planned a 30-day three-stage protest rallies - ""Samvidhan Bachao Abhiyan"" - over national issues, including the ""witch hunt against Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and family of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra"".

While the state level rallies will focus on national issues like ""subversion of Constitutional institutions, freedom of expression, attacks on federalism"", with eminent citizens to be invited to lend credence to the charges, the district protest agenda includes ""failures"" of the Modi govt - rising unemployment, inflation, collapse of MSMEs, rural distress and weakening of welfare policies - which would be buttressed by local narratives and testimonials of citizens.In contrast, the assembly protest rallies will talk about the ""collapse of local governance"" and ""targeting"" of opposition members through agencies and ""marginalisation"" of SC/ST/OBC/minorities, with focus on ""ideological betrayal"" of the constitutional promise of social justice.While the protests are devised to highlight the ""harassment"" of the Gandhi family by BJP, Congress strategists see it as an opportune vehicle to mobilise people, which fits well with the party's new-found interest in empowering the district units to rejuvenate the cadres and increase the voter outreach.","The party has planned a household-level political outreach between may 20 and may 30.

How was Prakash murdered?



Poll Should Pallavi's mental health history be considered in the investigation? No, it doesn't matter Yes, it is crucial

'Killed the monster'



'My mother Pallavi and my sister Kriti used to ...'



Property angle being probed



'This is a distress call from Pallavi Omprakash'



Daughter taken to hospital



NEW DELHI: The murder of former Karnataka Police chief om Prakash , allegedly by his wife, has sent shockwaves across the state as chilling details about the intensity and magnitude of the incident emerge.Prakash's wife Pallavi was arrested on Monday on a complaint by their son Kartikesh who suspected the involvement of his mother and sister in the killing. The case has also been transferred to the Central Crime Branch of Bengaluru (CCB) for further investigation.Prakash was found murdered in his HSR Layout house Sunday evening following an alleged heated exchange with his wife.According to police, Pallavi threw chilli powder and attacked 64-years-old Prakash with a kitchen knife as he was eating his lunch between 2.30pm and 3pm on Sunday. She initially stabbed him in the neck and later hit him with a bottle of oil, police sources said, citing Pallavi's statement and findings from the crime scene.According to sources, Prakash is suspected to have struggled lying on the floor for over 15 minutes before breathing his last. Two bottles — one of a toilet cleaner and another of floor cleaner — were found next to his body. Prakash is said to have attempted running out of the house as Pallavi attacked him, but she threw a blanket on his face and pushed him to the ground. She allegedly stabbed him multiple times in the neck, shoulder, abdomen, and back as Prakash pleaded with her to spare him.Pallavi stood next to Prakash who lay face down, his head wrapped in the blanket. He was wearing a lungi, banian (undershirt), and slippers. His lungi and banian were soaked in blood by the time a police team reached the spot, a senior officer said.There is suspicion that Kriti, the couple's daughter, was present on the same floor during the murder, but that is yet to be established. ""When our team reached the spot, she was in her house on the third floor,"" the officer added.When police took Pallavi to the crime scene, she told reporters there that ""domestic violence"" was the reason behind the extreme step. Sources claimed that after killing her husband, she made a video call to her friend, a retired officer's wife, and said, ""I have killed the monster.""Pallavi also called two others and informed them of the incident. One of them alerted police helpline 112. But before Hoysala police arrived at the spot, Pallavi herself had called HSR Layout police and informed them about the murder.Prakash's son Kartikesh said that on Sunday around 5 pm, when he was at the Karnataka Golf Association in Domlur, his neighbour called him to inform him that his father was found lying downstairs.In his complaint to the police after the incident, he alleged that his mother Pallavi had been threatening to kill his father for the past one week. ""Due to these threats, my father went to stay at his sister' s house ,"" he said.""Two days ago, my younger sister Kriti went there and pressured my father to return home. She brought him back against his will,"" Kartikesh alleged.""I rushed home and found police officers and people present on the spot. My father was lying in a pool of blood with injuries on his head and body. A broken bottle and a knife were found next to his body. He was then taken to St John's Hospital,"" he explained.""My mother Pallavi and my sister Kriti used to fight with my father often. I strongly suspect that they are involved in the murder of my father. I request you to initiate legal action in this case,"" he said in his complaint to the police.Sources said the murder was the culmination of frequent run-ins between the couple. It is learnt that a dispute over a piece of property in Karnataka's Dandeli was the focal point of the crime.Probe is on into multiple angles, including the property feud between the couple. A majority of Prakash's properties are in Uttara Kannada district. Prakash was superintendent of police, Uttara Kannada, in the early 1990s.Family sources told police Prakash had purchased a few acres of land in Joida during 2011-12. He has a farmhouse on five-acre land. Pallavi alleged that Prakash was not giving any property to her or her daughter, police sources said.Another senior police officer said a few days ago, Pallavi sent a message in the IPS officers' WhatsApp group requesting that a suo-motu case be registered and action taken against her husband. ""This is a distress call from Pallavi Omprakash. And an online FIR from me. Please take SUO. MOTO. Cognizance and SUO moto ACTION. Me and my daughter have been under severe domestic violence at the hands of my husband Omprakash, Ex DGP Karnataka (sic),"" the officer quoted Pallavi's message as saying.Pallavi claimed he was lacing her food with insulin and sanitiser. ""Now, he has started drugging my daughter, targeting her brain just because she started raising her voice. My daughter is dying every day. We are in a very precarious, dangerous, unsafe situation and need urgent help and security. My daughter's phone, laptop and all digital devices have been hacked or made dysfunctional. We need urgent security. As for proof, there is no dearth.""""My husband tries to cover up his acts by declaring people as mentally unstable as and when required... All these events are for the sake of property greed and jealousy. My husband is supporting my son and daughter-in-law. Greed. Lust for money corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely...,"" her message read.Kriti didn't open her third-floor house door for police Sunday; they had to force it open. She refused to go with police and is said to have created a ruckus. According to police sources, she kept on telling them not to touch her.She also is said to have resisted giving her fingerprints, relenting only after much cajoling.It has also been learnt that Pallavi was diagnosed with schizophrenia and was taking medicines.Meanwhile, the former top police brass was cremated with full state honours in Bengaluru on Monday after the autopsy. Kartikesh performed the last rites.Speaking to reporters after the cremation, Kartikesh said, ""After yesterday's incident, I lodged a complaint. The police are doing their job, and I have full faith in them. I don't want to comment further as the investigation will reveal everything. Let's wait for that.""The 68-year-old retired IPS officer was a native of Champaran, Bihar, and held a Master's degree in Geology. Prakash was appointed Director General of Police on March 1, 2015.",Former karnataka police chief prakash was found dead in his home sunday evening.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister on Tuesday said that she will visit the violence-hit district of Murshidabad in the first week of May.""I will visit troubled areas of Murshidabad in first week of May,"" she said speaking at a government event.Violence struck Murshidabad during anti-Waqf (Amendment) Act protests leading to three deaths, with hundreds fleeing their homes. The protest later spread to several other districts, including Malda, South 24 Parganas, and Hooghly, with reports of arson, stone-pelting, and road blockades.Last week, West Bengal governor CV Ananda Bose had visited Murshidabad, ignoring Mamata's request not to go.Bose visited Murshidabad and met with the victim families on Saturday. He said the victims seek a ""sense of security"" and promised to raise their concerns with both central and state governments.""They (victims) want to have a sense of security and certainly some other demands or whatever suggestions given by them. All this will be considered... We'll be in touch with them.

He claimed that police reports contradicted her assertion that “outsiders” were responsible.The CPI(M) has demanded a judicial probe, accusing both the BJP and TMC of fuelling “competitive communalism” to distract from pressing issues like unemployment and inflation. Addressing a rally in Kolkata, CPI(M) state secretary Mohammed Salim claimed that both parties were colluding to polarise voters ahead of the 2026 state elections.In a show of strength, the Left party kickstarted its campaign with a major rally at Brigade Parade Grounds.National Commission for Women (NCW) chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar has called on the West Bengal government to act urgently to address the plight of riot-hit women in Murshidabad.
