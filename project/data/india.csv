air quality

and

livelihoods

NEW DELHI: With its order banning crackers in Delhi and NCR openly breached during last Diwali, the Supreme Court on Friday asked the Centre to devise by Oct 8 a mechanism in consultation with stakeholders to ensure production and sale of only green crackers.A bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria said if the ban on bursting of crackers in Delhi NCR could not be enforced, it would be proper to allow sale of green crackers, which conform to norms devised by NEERI and Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO).Firecracker manufacturers through senior advocates Balbir Singh and K Parameswara pleaded for resumption of production of green crackers, saying workers are jobless. The Union govt, through additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, did not support a ban on green crackers.Amicus curiae Aparajita Singh told the bench that it is the enforcement which had been found to be lacking. There are instances where the green cracker manufacturing licence-holders sold labels to those producing non-green crackers, which emit noxious gases harmful to the infants, infirm and elderly, she said.The CJI-led bench said, ""As experienced, the Supreme Court's order imposing a complete ban on bursting of crackers could not be enforced. In one case where the SC banned mining, the illegal mafia took over and resorted to mining. Hence, it is necessary to adopt a balanced approach which safeguards both the ambient air quality and the livelihood of cracker unit workers.""The bench asked Bhati to communicate to the ministry of environment and forest to convene meeting of all stakeholders, and consult amicus curiae in arriving at a plan of action and mechanism to enforce green cracker only rule for Delhi and NCR, which from Diwali till major parts of the winter months get enveloped by a thick smog mainly because of burning of crop residue in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.SC permitted the manufacturers to commence production of green crackers strictly in conformity with the norms laid down by NEERI and PESO but barred them from selling these, for the time being, in Delhi-NCR. It said further orders on sale of these crackers in Delhi-NCR will be considered on Oct 8.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) informed the SC that there appear to be gaps in monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. ""A rigorous, transparent, and year-round enforcement and monitoring mechanism is required to oversee manufacturing, distribution and sale of firecrackers, whereby PESO and authorities must conduct random, surprise inspections and collect samples directly from firecracker manufacturing sites and selling premises for testing them to confirm whether they conform to the prescribed standards,"" it said.CAQM said given the extraordinary air pollution situation in Delhi-NCR, CPCB and CSIR-NEERI must assess the contribution of firecrackers to air pollution.NEERI favoured allowing green crackers across India based on the air quality status of different cities and regions. According to NEERI, ""The marketing of non-green fireworks should be controlled by PESO. CSIR-NEERI has provided a list of approved green firework manufacturers on its website. Any manufacturer not on the list and producing firecrackers should be making non-green (illegal) crackers, which require strict monitoring by the regulatory agency, PESO. ""","Supreme court asks centre to devise mechanism to ensure production and sale of only green crackers.

with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three

books

with teachings on virtue, wealth, and

love

and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

“I was just talking to her yesterday; how can she be gone today?”

memento mori

“But this does not look like my doll.”

“My travels have changed me.”

“Everything you love will probably be lost. But in the end, love will return in another way.”

“Irul neengi inbam payakkum marul neengi





Māśāru kāatchi yavarukku.”

Those who see through ignorance to reality find bliss;

Others remain fettered by delusion.

For the young, death feels like smoke drifting somewhere far away; visible but distant. Life is a horizon that stretches endlessly. But as the years pass, the horizon shifts. Just as a stream running atop a hill must eventually surrender itself into a waterfall, the path of life too bends toward its inevitable descent.The first losses often come from a distance—distant relatives, grandparents, elders whose absence seems natural. But the circle keeps tightening. Parents, close relatives, friends; people we meet on an everyday basis begin their journey to the other shore. Some losses feel impossible to accept:As one ages, the news of death becomes strangely more frequent than the news of life. I remember my mother, in her later years, turning to the obituary page of her daily newspaper first. Then, as though offering a silent prayer for the departed—or perhaps breathing a sigh of relief that no familiar name appeared—she would turn to the other pages.Across civilizations, cultures, and religions, humanity has carried with it the idea of—'remember that you will die’. Far from being a grim obsession, this idea is a mirror, showing us what truly matters. Death, in its silent authority, has always been the ultimate purveyor of perspective. It strips away the petty burdens of worry, exposing how trivial most of our concerns are.When someone close departs, the memories arrive like lightning—sudden, sharp, and luminous. Time, the great healer, eventually lays a hand upon the wound. Acceptance grows, but never fully without scars. A familiar song, a forgotten photograph, or a date on the calendar is enough to unearth the pain again. How powerless we stand before the mighty force of Time, who takes away everyone and everything.I am reminded of a story from Franz Kafka’s life. One day he saw a little girl weeping over the loss of her beloved doll in a park. The next day, he handed her a letter ‘from the doll’, explaining that she had gone on a journey and would write of her adventures. Day after day, Kafka met the girl and read out letters full of imagined travels. Months later, he brought her a new doll, saying it had returned from its journeys. The girl protested,Kafka handed her another letter where the doll had written:The child embraced the doll and found peace.Years later, after Kafka’s death, the girl, now an adult, discovered a letter hidden inside the doll. In it, Kafka had written:That is the mystery of loss. People may depart, but the love they poured into us never vanishes. It lingers, takes new shapes, and strengthens us to continue living and passing that love forward. This great continuum—this unbroken chain of love—is perhaps all that life truly is.For those who awaken to this realization, joy and sorrow lose their sharp edges. Life’s ephemeral happenings no longer bind them. Thiruvalluvar expressed this profound vision with unmatched clarity:In the end, grief dissolves into perspective, love returns in other forms, and we learn to flow—like the river—toward the sea of acceptance.","Thirukkural is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Friday said a candidate, whose name is registered as a voter in multiple constituencies, can't contest polls.

HYDERABAD: Rail connectivity between Telangana and Maharashtra is set to get a significant boost, as the railways have decided to introduce two new Vande Bharat trains — one between Hyderabad and Pune, and the other on the Secunderabad–Nanded route.These new services are expected to reduce travel times by two to three hours. This will be the third Vande Bharat connection from Hyderabad to Maharashtra, following the service to Nagpur.Hyderabad is currently served by four Vande Bharat trains, and adding these two routes aims to further strengthen connectivity and ease passenger movement between Telangana and Maharashtra.As part of the plan, the govt is considering replacing the Secunderabad–Pune Shatabdi Express with a Vande Bharat Express. The Shatabdi currently completes the journey in about eight and a half hours, operating six days a week (except Tuesdays) with limited stops and a composition of two AC executive class coaches, nine AC chair cars and two EOG cars.This comes in response to the overwhelming popularity of the existing Vande Bharat trains on the Secunderabad–Visakhapatnam, Secunderabad–Tirupati and Kacheguda–Yeshvantpur routes, which consistently run at high occupancy levels.Encouraged by this success, the railways have drawn up proposals for two more Vande Bharat services from Secunderabad, highlighting the growing demand from passengers for faster rail options.""With the addition of these two new trains, the South Central Railway (SCR) will operate seven Vande Bharat services, placing it among the zones with the highest number of these indigenous semi-high-speed trains.

NEW DELHI: Patiala house court on Wednesday heard arguments on the bail plea of Gaganpreet Kaur, who has been in custody for ten days following her arrest in connection with a culpable homicide case.The court directed Delhi Police to produce CCTV footage and other evidence to support their case. Both the defence counsel and the public prosecutor were asked to file written submissions. The matter has been listed for further hearing tomorrow, 25 September, at 2 pm.Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) opposed Kaur’s bail plea, telling the court, “The intention of the accused was not to save the injured rather to save herself from legal proceedings.”However, Kaur’s counsel countered this claim, arguing, “The intention of the accused is misconceived. She is not a doctor and did not have the knowledge that in how much time the patient may die.”The defence stressed that the case did not fall under culpable homicide not amounting to murder.“She is not seeking an anticipatory bail, she is in custody for 10 days after her arrest,” the counsel said.The lawyer further told the court that Kaur is not a flight risk and has fully cooperated with investigators. “Her mobile and drive have been handed over to the police when it was asked,” the counsel submitted.Emphasising the family’s circumstances, the defence added: “The entire family is victim and all the evidence is with the police.”",Gaganpreet kaur has been in custody for ten days following her arrest in connection with a culpable homicide case.

Calcutta High Court on Friday struck down Centre’s decision to deport two women and their families from Birbhum, West Bengal, to Bangladesh.The court said the deportation was illegal and ordered that all six people, including three children, be brought back to India within a month. The court also dismissed the Centre’s request for a temporary stay on the order.Petitions were filed by family members of Sonali Bibi and Sweety Bibi, both from Paikar in Murarai, Birbhum.The women said their husbands and children had been living and working in Delhi for over 20 years as daily wage earners. On June 18, Delhi Police detained them on suspicion of being Bangladeshi nationals. Nine days later, on June 27, they were deported across the border. Reports said they were later arrested by the Bangladesh police.Sonali’s family told the court that she was nine months pregnant when deported, raising fears about her newborn’s citizenship if the child was born in Bangladesh.Lawyers for the families argued that the deportation was carried out despite them showing proper documents, including land papers, voter ID cards of their parents and grandparents, and birth certificates of their children issued by government hospitals.The Centre, in its affidavit, said the plea was not valid before the Calcutta High Court since petitions had already been filed in the Delhi High Court. It also argued that Delhi Police acted under instructions from the ministry of home affairs, which had issued a memo in May 2025 detailing the process for deporting Bangladeshi or Myanmar nationals.After the judgment, Trinamool Congress MP Samirul Islam said the court’s order exposed the BJP’s attempt to brand poor Bengali families as illegal immigrants wrongly. Calling it a “victory for Bengal,” he said the deportation was part of an anti-Bengali, anti-poor agenda.","Calcutta high court on friday struck down centre’s decision to deport two women and their families from birbhum, west bengal.

At the same time, India stands against illegal migration,"" he added.Jaiswal explained that Indian authorities verify the nationality of individuals referred to them and facilitate their return only after confirming their documents and legal status.He added that whenever a person does not possess legal status in any country and is referred to India with claims of being an Indian national, authorities conduct a background check, confirm the nationality and then arrange their return. This is how deportations from the United States have been handled.Harjit Kaur, a Sikh woman from Pangota village in Tarn Taran, Punjab, had lived in the US for more than three decades after moving there with her sons following her husband’s death.She worked in the San Francisco Bay Area and had applied for asylum multiple times, all of which were denied. Her case attracted widespread attention in the US, with hundreds of people rallying in California demanding her release.Kaur was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers during a routine immigration check on September 8 this year. She was placed in handcuffs, transported in a van to Georgia under harsh conditions and held without her family or attorney being informed. After about 48 hours in custody, ICE deported her to India.During the ordeal, she said, “After living there for so long, you are suddenly detained and deported this way, it is better to die than to face this. In such a situation, one should not live.”She added, “I was in handcuffs the entire time, I couldn’t sit properly, and no one informed my family.” Kaur described the journey as harrowing, highlighting the lack of food, water and medical care.","In the last several months, since january 2025, we've had 2417 indian nationals deported or repatriated from the united states.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday launched the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana for Bihar, transferring Rs 10,000 each to the bank accounts of 75 lakh women in the state. The scheme, worth Rs 7,500 crore, also promises additional financial support of up to Rs 2 lakh for women to enhance their entrepreneurial skills in the future.Launching the initiative virtually from Delhi, PM Modi was joined online by Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, deputy chief minister Samrat Choudhary, and other state ministers in Patna. “Bihar's women now have two brothers, Nitish and Modi, who are working tirelessly for their betterment,” the prime minister said, addressing beneficiaries who also participated in large numbers via video link.Assembly elections in the state are due later this year.According to the PMO, the scheme, an initiative of Bihar’s NDA government, is designed to empower women through self-employment and livelihood opportunities. Each beneficiary, one from every family, will receive Rs 10,000 as an initial grant through Direct Benefit Transfer, with the possibility of further assistance of up to Rs 2 lakh in subsequent phases.This support may be used for activities ranging from agriculture and animal husbandry to tailoring, weaving, handicrafts, and other small enterprises.The programme also has a community-driven element, with self-help group resource persons providing training and guidance to help women build sustainable ventures. To aid in marketing, Gramin haat bazaars will be further developed across the state, the official statement said.The PMO noted that over one crore women across Bihar witnessed the launch at the district, block, cluster, and village levels. Modi also interacted with some of the recipients, underscoring the government’s focus on making women “Aatmanirbhar.”Earlier in the day, Uttar Pradesh minister Narendra Kashyap applauded the initiative, saying, “PM Modi has always been concerned about the development and welfare of the country, especially for empowering women. PM Modi has implemented numerous schemes to honour women, and in Bihar too, PM Modi is going to launch a scheme worth thousands of crores to empower women.”He added, “Surely, the women and people of Bihar will benefit from these schemes of the PM, and Bihar will also get the opportunity to be included among the main developing states of the country.”","Pm narendra modi launches mukhyamantri mahila rojgar yojana for bihar, transferring rs 10,000 each to the bank accounts of 75 lakh women in the state.

People in Jammu and Kashmir have also made a similar demand of statehood ever since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019. Authorities in Leh have imposed restrictions under Section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023.According to an order from the district magistrate, an assembly of five or more persons is banned in the district; no procession, rally or march is to be carried out without prior written approval in Leh.It is well known that the government of India has been actively engaged with the Apex Body Leh and the Kargil Democratic Alliance on the same issues.

He might have anticipated his arrest, going by his remarks to reporters an hour earlier. ""My being inside jail would awaken the people of the country more than my being outside,"" he said.A senior police officer said Wangchuk might be taken outside Ladakh for interrogation.A day earlier, the Union govt revoked the FCRA licence of Wangchuk's Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh, citing ""serious discrepancies"" in financial accounting, including alleged violations involving cash deposits, undeclared donations and a fund transfer of Rs 4.93 lakh from Sweden that the MHA termed ""against national interest"".All educational institutions in Ladakh will remain shut for two days as a precautionary measure, the administration said.Chering Dorjay Lakruk, co-chairperson of Leh Apex Body (LAB), dismissed the allegations against Wangchuk as baseless. He said that on Sept 23, LAB-affiliated Apex Body Youth called for a shutdown in Leh after two people fasting alongside Wangchuk collapsed.After news spread about their condition, about 7,500 protesters gathered at the protest site the following day. The crowd later hurled stones at the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council office, leading to the mayhem in which four protesters died.Wangchuk had started his hunger strike on Sept 9 to demand Sixth Schedule protection and statehood for Ladakh. He ended the fast on Wednesday. ""It is sad the govt is blaming Wangchuk,"" Lakruk said.He said that despite setbacks, Ladakhi organisations would go ahead with the scheduled Oct 6 talks with an MHA-appointed committee. The delegation will travel to Delhi on Sept 30 after the funerals of the four people killed in Wednesday's violence.Kargil Democratic Alliance's Sajjad Kargili, too, contested the charges slapped on Wangchuk. ""I strongly condemn this brutal crackdown on the Ladakhi leadership. Our struggle for statehood and Sixth Schedule status will continue. No detention or witch-hunt can deter us,"" he said.Sixth Schedule grants tribal areas in the Northeast autonomy over land, resources and culture. Ladakhis have sought similar protections since 2019, when the erstwhile state of J&K was split into two Union territories. Talks with the central committee set up in 2023 has so far yielded only a domicile policy.Lieutenant governor Kavinder Gupta said any attempt to disturb peace in the region would be strictly dealt with. ""We are in touch with religious leaders to keep the situation normal,"" he said.","Activist sonam wangchuk charged with inciting violent unrest, among other offences.

There was no warning, no tear gas, no water cannon. Most of the injured were hit by bullets or pellets, which shows excessive use of force,” Dorjay told reporters.The protest was triggered after discontent over the Centre scheduling talks with LAB for October 6, despite worsening health conditions of participants in a hunger strike led by climate activist Sonam Wangchuk. According to Dorjay, more than 7,500 people, largely youth, gathered at the strike venue on September 24, compared to the usual 500.The agitation soon escalated into stone-pelting at the Hill Development Council office and vandalism at a BJP office.Dismissing allegations that the mob was armed, Dorjay said, “There was an attempt to give it an anti-national colour. Protesters removed party flags but did not touch the national flag. Many even carried the tricolour.”He also refuted suggestions by Ladakh Lieutenant Governor Kavinder Gupta and others about foreign involvement, calling it an attempt to deflect blame. “If there was a foreign hand, what were the security agencies doing? Outsiders may have been injured, but that was because of indiscriminate firing,” he said.Dorjay further claimed that newly deployed CRPF personnel beat up bystanders and that the force’s presence was part of a plan to “suppress the movement.”On the way forward, he said the LAB has sought bail for those detained and will resume talks with the Union home ministry after the funerals of the victims. “It is crucial to know why live bullets were used on the head and chest.

""Women of Bihar suffered a lot under the RJD rule... There were no roads, law and order was pathetic... but now women feel safe and secure under the Nitish Kumar government as the rule of law prevails. Hence, they must ensure that RJD and its allies never return to power,"" Modi said.""When the RJD was in power in Bihar, women suffered immensely due to the chaos and corruption... roads were broken and dilapidated, there was no trace of any bridge or culvert. Floods caused so much trouble...pregnant women could not reach hospitals on time, and did not get timely treatment.

Jharkhand’s Maiya Samman Yojna offers assistance to mothers for health and welfare needs, and Madhya Pradesh’s Ladli Behna Yojna ensures monthly cash transfers to eligible women for household support.Maharashtra’s Ladki Bahin Yojana aims at empowering girls through direct financial aid, whereas West Bengal’s Lakshmir Bhandar Scheme gives basic income support to women in all eligible households. Chhattisgarh’s Mahatari Vandana Yojana provides allowances to women to strengthen their financial independence. Rekha Gupta-led Delhi government had also approved the Mahila Samridhi Yojana aimed at providing Rs 2,500 to women from economically weaker sections.In Bihar, this election-eve scheme is likely to give a huge boost to the NDA given the fact that Nitish Kumar already enjoys considerable support among the women voters in the state. Nitish Kumar has in the last two decades launched several women-centric schemes starting from his much successful ""bicycle and uniform scheme"" for school girls. In fact, his decision to impose prohibition in the state was also widely appreciated by women, especially in the rural areas.Little wonder, the opposition has been quick to call the new scheme a bribe to the voters of the state. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra cautioned voters not to be swayed by these election doles. Referring to the disbursement of Rs 7,500 crore, the Congress leader said, ""Now that elections are round the corner, Rs 10,000 is being offered by the government. But, take note, they are not promising that the dole will continue every month. """"Women have the capacity to sense people's true intentions (neeyat). They make use of this faculty while looking for a match for their daughters. You must, similarly, realise the true intentions of Modi, Shah and Nitish,"" Vadra said.However, this attack is unlikely to hold as the Congress has also used welfare schemes to win elections in states like Karnataka, Telangana and Himachal Pradesh.

CCTV Footage of Air India Plane Crash Emerges. Watch What Happened After Take-off

Crash briefing: What happened on June 12?

NEW DELHI: A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking a court-monitored investigation into the June 12 Air India crash in Ahmedabad that killed 260 people, including passengers, crew and civilians.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi tagged the plea with another pending case raising similar concerns. The court asked the petitioner, Akhilesh Kumar Mishra, a Delhi University research scholar and practising advocate to serve copies of the petition to the attorney general and the solicitor general.Senior advocate Rajiv Shakdher, representing the petitioner said that his client wanted a fair and transparent probe into the tragedy. The plea, filed through advocate Shubham Upadhya, stressed the need for court intervention to ensure the investigation is independent.The plea referred to the preliminary report of the Ministry of Civil Aviation’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) which suggested the crash was caused by an abrupt shutdown of both engines after the fuel control switches moved from “run” to “cutoff” within a one-second.However, the petition raised “inconsistencies and contradictions,” pointing to cockpit voice recordings where one pilot asked, “Why did you cut off?” and the other replied, “I didn’t.” The aircraft had been airborne for just 40 seconds before the crash.The plea also argued that both pilots were highly experienced with a combined 19000 flying hours, including over 9000 hours on Boeing 787s. Aviation experts have said that the fuel cutoff switches require deliberate action and cannot be flipped accidentally, ruling out pilot error.The petitioner alleged that despite signs of possible design flaws, software issues or systemic failures, Boeing had not been held accountable in the report. Instead, the investigation appeared to place blame on the deceased pilots, a move the plea claimed allowed Boeing to “evade liability.”""The current trajectory of the investigation appears to unjustifiably shift blame onto the deceased pilots, who are unable to defend themselves, thereby allowing Boeing to evade liability, a pattern not unfamiliar in its corporate history,"" plea said.It also questioned the credibility of the probe, pointing out that details of the AAIB’s preliminary report appeared in the Wall Street Journal nearly 20 hours before the official release, undermining its confidentiality.Earlier, on September 22, the Supreme Court had agreed to hear a similar plea filed by NGO Safety Matters Foundation. At that time, the court described the selective publication of the preliminary report as “unfortunate and irresponsible,” saying it risked shaping a one-sided media narrative.The court has already issued notices to the Centre and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on the demand for an independent and expeditious investigation.It also stressed that such probes must protect the privacy and dignity of victims’ families and be conducted swiftly to prevent speculation or selective leaks in the media. Air India Flight AI-171, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner carrying 242 passengers and crew, had taken off for London but crashed minutes later into a hostel block of the BJ Medical College campus near the airport.The crash killed 241 passengers and crew aboard and 33 people on the ground, bringing the total confirmed fatalities to 274, making it the deadliest single-aircraft disaster in Indian aviation history.Among the victims were former Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani and several medical staff and students from the college. Only one passenger, Viswashkumar Ramesh, survived.Preliminary AAIB findings revealed that the fuel cutoff switches for both engines moved from “RUN” to “CUTOFF” within one second of each other, about three seconds after takeoff.","A plea has been filed in the supreme court seeking a court-monitored investigation.
