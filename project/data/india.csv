It lamented that govt is ""having its way and say both"", which is not acceptable in a democracy like India.Congress breaking of silence on the JPC after the boycott announced by TMC, Samajwadi Party, Sena UBT and AAP suggests that the largest INDIA bloc player may be veering towards the view of its allies, even as it has not announced a decision on whether it will participate in the crucial panel. Amid uncertainty, Parliament has not notified the committee despite a passage of nearly 20 days.Congress general secretary KC Venugopal told TOI, ""In a parliamentary democracy, opposition can also put forward its views in committees. But look at the way waqf bill was passed in the JPC. In these committees, opposition parties are not being allowed to raise issues. It may be an extreme characterisation by me. But the fact is that the govt side is bulldozing bills. In a healthy democracy, it is not so.""The argument echoes the TMC-led 'boycott bloc', which recently announced it will not join the JPC because such panels have become a BJP ""stunt"" to use its majority to force bills.Congress has not yet given its view on the JPC, even though there has been an internal opinion that the party should join the panel.Buttressing his charge against BJP, Venugopal said the Modi govt did not allow a discussion on special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar in the recent Monsoon session of Parliament, despite over 240 MPs demanding it.""Even the 130th constitutional amendment bill presented by the home minister was passed amid din. Do you expect this in a democracy like India? Regrettably, it is not the old era where Parliament discussed all the issues. However, we feel there should be a consensus among all opposition parties on the JPC. We will discuss it with INDIA bloc members and appropriate decisions will be taken,"" he said.It is to be seen if TMC, SP, Sena UBT and AAP can be persuaded to rescind their decision to boycott. Else, it may mean that Congress would also join them. DMK, NCP, CPM are said to be waiting for Congress to take a call. TMC started the push for boycott after the bill was tabled in Lok Sabha, but Congress and some allies were confident that their view of joining the panel would prevail.

ICSSR's research call on family system echoes Sangh concern,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/icssrs-research-call-on-family-system-echoes-sangh-concern/articleshow/123841616.cms,"NEW DELHI: At a time when India's family structures are facing pressure from urbanisation, migration and changing lifestyles, the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) has called for major research on 'kutumb vyavastha' - the traditional Indian family system, in an initiative which reflects Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh 's concern about the protection of traditional family values.Under the scheme ""Family and Family System in India"" which it will launch on Friday, 150 projects will be granted financial support of a maximum of Rs 30 lakh each, with a total allocated budget of Rs 11.25 crore.The move comes as Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) prepares to mark its centenary in 2025-26 by giving a fillip to its 'Panch Parivartan' agenda, which highlights five areas of change: family values, social harmony, eco-friendly living, self-reliance and civic duties. ""The joint family system (kutumb vyavastha) is not just a living arrangement. It is an ecosystem of emotional bonds, economic support, intergenerational care and value transmission,"" said Dhananjay Singh, member secretary, ICSSR.He added that the family has always been ""the first physical and psychological space of socialisation, ethical experience and community interdependence"".The ICSSR has invited studies from sociology, anthropology, law, psychology and culture scholars for the purpose.Researchers are expected to look at 19 themes, such as 'Kutumb Prabodhan' (family awakening), the role of women in keeping cultural values alive, inter-generational value transmission, and the strain on caregiving in today's fast-paced, globalised and highly competitive world. Topics such as technology's effect on families, the balance between nuclear and joint households, migration-linked disruptions, generational conflicts, rising concerns around loneliness and social isolation, ageing populations and mental health challenges will also be part of the wide-ranging agenda.By stressing the family as the first space for ethical learning and community bonding, the initiative ties in with RSS's view that ""harmonious families create harmonious communities"".For the Sangh, its centenary is not just a symbolic milestone but a chance to spread this idea widely as part of its larger social outreach.Singh said that while modern work culture and urban life have weakened some traditions, Indian families remain ""deeply rooted in emotions, care, devotion and sacrifice"". The ICSSR, he said, aims to generate studies that both capture these changes and revive indigenous knowledge, making family systems central to India's social and cultural future. The scale of funding - higher than in many recent ICSSR thematic calls - signals that family and community studies are now being treated as a national research priority.","Indian council of social science research (icssr) has called for major research on 'kutumb vyavastha' - the traditional indian family system. 150 projects will be granted financial support of a maximum of rs 30 lakh each, with a total allocated budget of rs 11.25 crore.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123841817,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-119734,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

The clip was posted by the Bihar unit of the Congress.“The Congress has sworn to repeatedly insult the late mother of PM Shri Narendra Modi Ji. When they found nothing, they showed his mother in a fake video, making her say words that are a complete insult to her,” the Bihar BJP posted on X, alleging that such videos were being circulated at the behest of “arrogant” and “anarchic” Rahul Gandhi.The clip, shared on Wednesday, begins with an AI version of PM Modi going to sleep after declaring that the day’s “vote chori” (vote theft) is done. He then dreams of his mother, and the AI version of Heeraben appears.“First you forced me to stand in long queues during demonetisation and made a reel of washing my feet. Now you are doing politics in Bihar in my name. You are getting banners of my ‘insult’ printed. You are again doing drama in Bihar. How low will you stoop?” she asks, before “PM Modi” hurriedly wakes up.Gandhi has repeatedly accused the Election Commission of indulging in “vote chori” to benefit the BJP — a charge the poll body has firmly denied.This comes days after the prime minister was abused during a Congress-RJD rally in the poll-bound state, with his mother being mentioned. He hit back soon after, calling the remarks an insult not only to him but to “every mother, sister, and daughter of the country,” adding that the people of Bihar shared his anguish.Heeraben Modi passed away in December 2022 at the age of 99.",The clip was posted by the bihar unit of the congress.

Police are trying to piece together how the gunshots were fired and what led to the shooting as the two students were considered ""inseparable"" by friends.The incident occurred around 10.30am at RCI Vidya Vihar hostel in Knowledge Park-III. The two students - Deepak Kumar (22) from Andhra Pradesh and Devansh Chauhan (23) from Agra - were both enrolled in the PGDM programme at Birla Institute of Management Technology (Bimtech). They were, however, not roommates. It was in Kumar's room where the shots were fired. Chauhan is in Kailash hospital. His condition is critical.Both bullets came from the same licensed revolver, which was fully loaded and belonged to Chauhan's father Surender Singh Chauhan, who retired as a circle officer in UP STF on Aug 31. Chauhan, who went home last Saturday to attend his father's farewell party, is believed to have sneaked the gun out when he left for his hostel on Tuesday morning itself.Chauhan had reached the hostel barely a couple of hours before the incident.""He had come home on Saturday to attend our father's retirement party.

Unable to get any response, he alerted the hostel warden. After repeated attempts to open the door failed, some staff members climbed to the rear balcony with a ladder and peered inside. What they saw was shocking. Inside, Kumar lay dead. Chauhan was groaning in pain.According to the chief medical officer of Kailash hospital, the bullet lodged in Kumar's head was fired from the right side. ""The boy suffered brain death,"" he said.In Chauhan's case too, the bullet was fired from the right. ""The revolver had six bullets. Two were used, four remain. No official complaint has been filed yet,"" the investigating officer said.A police team arrived at the hostel around 11.30am and secured the area. Forensic experts recovered the revolver, four live cartridges, and two bullet shells.
