NEW DELHI: Industrialist Sunjay Kapur's third wife Priya Sachdev Kapur asked Delhi HC to let her submit a list of her late husband's assets and liabilities in a sealed cover. She alleged Thursday that pleadings from the partition suit were being leaked to the media and said the documents carried financial implications. The court will hear the matter on Oct 9.The case was filed by Kapur's first wife, actor Karisma Kapoor , along with their son and daughter (Kiaan and Samaira), who are seeking a share of their father's estate. Kapur and Karisma divorced in 2016.The court earlier directed Priya to produce a comprehensive statement of Kapur's personal assets as of June 12. On Sept 10, she was told to file the full list.Priya's lawyer Shyel Trehan argued Thursday that the details contained sensitive information and urged that at least two pages be kept confidential. Counsel for Karisma's children opposed the request. The HC bench said while limited confidentiality could be granted, ""the whole suit can't be in a sealed cover"".Kiaan and Samaira have challenged Sanjay's purported will and sought shares in his assets reportedly worth Rs 30,000 crore. Priya, meanwhile, informed the court that they have already received Rs 1,900 crore from the family trust.","Karisma kapoor’s kids challenge billionaire dad’s will in ₹30,000 cr estate feud in delhi hc.

India's forest cover expanded by mere 2.5% in 10 yrs but 'very dense' cover grew 22.7%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-forest-cover-expanded-by-mere-2-5-in-10-yrs-but-very-dense-cover-grew-22-7/articleshow/124138513.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's forest cover increased by merely 2.5% between 2010-11 and 2021-22, but the 'very dense forest' component of it grew by 22.7% during the period, indicating effective regeneration and conservation efforts, claimed the central govt's first-ever dedicated publication on forest accounting. It recorded a decline only in the 'moderately dense forest' category.Released on Thursday, the physical asset accounting showed that forest cover (very dense, moderately dense and open forest) increased from 6,97,898 sq km in 2010-11 to 7,15,342 in 2021-22, adding 17,444 sq km (2.5%) in 10 years.During the same 10-year period, 'very dense forest' (VDF) increased by 19,000 sq km (from 83,502 sq km in 2010-11 to 1,02,502 sq km in 2021-22), whereas 'moderately dense forest' (MDF) decreased by 11,071 sq km (from 3,18,745 sq km to 3,07,673 sq km). The increase was also reported in the 'open forest' category from 2,95,651 sq km to 3,05,167 sq km (3.2% increase).All lands with tree canopy density of 70% and above come under VDF, whereas lands with tree canopy density of 40% and more but less than 70% are categorised as MDF. Similarly, all lands with tree canopy density of 10% and more but less than 40% come under the 'open forest' category.State-wise data shows the highest increase of 4,137 sq km in Kerala, followed by 3,122 sq km in Karnataka and 2,606 sq km in TN in the VDF category.The forest accounting was done by ministry of statistics and programme implementation adopting the UN System of Environmental Economic Accounts (SEEA) Framework which is an agreed international framework for the compilation of the environment economic accounts from 2018.Besides accounting the forest physical asset, it also analysed the 'forest condition' showing the status of growing stock, carbon stock, economic value and status of regeneration. The publication claimed the condition of forests has improved in terms of biomass and carbon storage, with reduced severe degradation indicating better forest health. It, however, underlined that the ""declining regeneration and rising fire risks"" highlight vulnerabilities in forest conditions that need urgent attention.",India's forest cover increased by merely 2.5% between 2010-11 and 2021-22.

"On 80-yr-old's plea, SC orders eviction of his 61-yr-old son",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/on-80-yr-olds-plea-sc-orders-eviction-of-his-61-yr-old-son/articleshow/124138246.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a case reflective of relationship issues that are unique to today's times, Supreme Court has come to the relief of an 80-year-old man and his 78-year-old wife and ordered eviction of their 61-year-old son from two rooms owned by the man in Mumbai after he failed to provide them with maintenance, as mandated under the Maintenance and Welfare of Senior Citizens Act, 2007.The octogenarian father and his wife had moved back to their native town in Uttar Pradesh after being pushed out of the properties - one room at Yadav Chawl in Yadav Nagar and another at Raju Estate, Bengali Chawl, Saki Naka -- by their eldest son who was running a business there.In July 2023, they filed for maintenance and eviction of their son from the said properties before the tribunal concerned, which in June last year directed the man to hand over possession of both the rooms to his parents and also provide them with a monthly maintenance of Rs 3,000. The son's challenge was rejected by the appellate tribunal. He then appealed against the eviction order in Bombay HC.The HC, on April 25, allowed the son's petition on the ground that the tribunal did not have the jurisdiction to pass an order for vacation of property against a senior citizen, the son being over 60 years old. The parents moved the SC against the HC order.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta termed the Bombay high court order erroneous and highlighted that the man was 59 years old when his parents moved the tribunal under the 2007 Act, which was enacted to address the plight of the elderly and to ensure their care and protection.""Being a welfare legislation, its provisions must be construed liberally so as to advance its beneficent purpose. This Court on several occasions has observed that the Tribunal is well within its powers to order eviction of a child or a relative from the property of a senior citizen, when there is a breach of the obligation to maintain the senior citizen,"" the bench said.Asking the son to vacate the two rooms in Mumbai and hand over their possession to his parents by Nov 30, the bench said, ""In the present case, despite being financially stable, the son has acted in breach of his statutory obligations in not allowing the parents to reside in the properties owned by the father, thereby frustrating the very object of the Act. The HC fell in error in allowing the writ petition on a completely untenable ground. """,The octogenarian father and his wife had moved back to their native town in uttar pradesh.

"School dropout rates halved in 2 years, says govt report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/school-dropout-rates-halved-in-2-years-says-govt-report/articleshow/124138112.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's school system has recorded one of its sharpest gains in recent years, with dropout rates falling significantly across all levels, according to the ministry of statistics and programme implementation's (MoSPI) Comprehensive Modular Survey: Education, 2025.The survey, conducted during April-June 2025 as part of the 80th round of the National Sample Survey, shows that dropout rates have nearly halved within just two years. At the secondary level, the rate fell to 8.2% in 2024-25 from 13.8% in 2022-23. At the middle level, it dropped to 3.5% from 8.1%, while at the preparatory stage, it declined to 2.3% compared with 8.7% earlier.This sharp improvement signals a structural turnaround in retention, suggesting that more children are staying enrolled and completing schooling. Experts link the gains to govt initiatives such as expanded mid-day meals, targeted scholarships for disadvantaged groups, better infrastructure under Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, and the flexibility introduced by the National Education Policy (NEP-2020).Yet the survey also uncovers a nuanced challenge around affordability. While more children are completing school, household spending on education has risen steadily.In rural India, the average annual expenditure per student on govt schools was Rs 2,639, compared to Rs 19,554 in non-govt schools. In urban areas, the difference is sharper - Rs 4,128 in govt schools against Rs 31,782 in private unaided institutions. Overall, 57% of students reported paying course fees, with the proportion much higher in private schools.This suggests that families are stretching finances to sustain education, even as retention improves. ""Improved retention is a success, but sustaining it requires keeping education affordable. Rising costs could become the next barrier, particularly for low-income families,"" said an official with the ministry of education.The steepest improvements were seen at the preparatory and middle levels, long considered vulnerable to socio-economic pressures. That these stages now show the lowest dropout levels is being read as proof that early interventions are paying off. But the secondary stage remains fragile, where adolescents face competing demands: household income, early work, and the absence of nearby higher-secondary schools.A MoSPI official noted, ""India is steadily moving towards ensuring that every child not only enters but also completes school. The challenge now is sustaining retention at the secondary stage, where aspirations often collide with financial realities.""The MoSPI report is particularly significant because it provides fresh national-level estimates after a seven-year gap, offering policymakers vital evidence for India's push towards universal secondary education and higher Gross Enrolment Ratios. Experts argue that if the current downward trend in dropouts continues, India could achieve near-universal school completion within a decade, provided affordability and access remain central to reforms.",India's school system has recorded one of its sharpest gains in recent years.

NEW DELHI: A farmer in Rajasthan’s Banswara on Thursday left the crowd in splits, and even drew a chuckle from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, when he took an indirect jibe at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi ’s viral “aalu se sona” remark.The exchange took place during the Prime Minister’s interaction with beneficiaries of the PM-KUSUM scheme, an initiative to promote solar energy in farming, during his visit to Banswara. Farmers from Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka joined the event.One local farmer, praising the scheme, said his long-cherished dream had been fulfilled through the installation of a solar plant on his land. Taking a swipe at Gandhi, he added: “The quip instantly lit up the audience, sparking laughter across the venue and a smile from PM Modi himself. BJP I-T department chief Amit Malviya also shared the clip of the exchange, saying: ""Prime Minister interacting with PM-KUSUM beneficiaries in Banswara. You just can’t miss the rustic sense of humour here"".The farmer referred to a 2017 remark attributed to Rahul Gandhi. A video that went viral on social media showed an edited version of the Congress leader supposedly saying he would install a machine that could turn potatoes into gold.However, the complete video later shared by the Congress showed Rahul Gandhi claiming that the remark had actually been made by Prime Minister Modi. The shorter clip of Rahul, with only the first part, had gone viral that year.The Prime Minister lauded the farmers of Banswara for turning to solar energy and leading the way in sustainable agriculture. “,” he remarked, highlighting how the scheme is helping farmers not only grow food but also generate and sell surplus energy.The Prime Minister laid the foundation stone of Anushakti Vidhyut Nigam Ltd's (ASHVINI) Mahi Banswara Rajasthan Atomic Power Project (4X700 MW) worth around Rs 42,000 crore in line with his commitment to transform India's power sector to ensure affordable, reliable, and sustainable power supply.It will be one of the largest nuclear plants in the country, supplying reliable base load energy, and will strengthen India's position in environmental stewardship and the evolving nuclear energy landscape.Mahi Banswara Rajasthan Atomic Power Project comprises four indigenous 700 MW Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors with advanced safety features, designed and developed by NPCIL.","The exchange took place during the prime minister’s interaction with beneficiaries of the pm-kusum scheme, an initiative to promote solar energy in farming.

SRINAGAR: Police detained 48 people during pre-dawn searches Thursday after four protesters were killed and more than 80 wounded when security forces allegedly opened fire to quash a violent demonstration in Leh demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh.Peace returned Thursday under heavy curfew. Traffic on streets in Leh was thin, with only official vehicles moving. Alongside police and paramilitary, ITBP patrolled to enforce order. District magistrate Romil Singh Donk ordered closure of all schools and colleges for two days from Sept 26.At Sonam Norboo Memorial Hospital, calm prevailed after Wednesday’s rush. Sources said four bodies were handed to families following autopsy, while recovered bullets were sent to Forensic Science Laboratory in J&K. About 60 of the wounded were discharged. One critical patient will be shifted to AIIMS, officials said.The clashes left 20 security personnel among the wounded. Protesters torched the BJP office, damaged public property, and threw stones at forces. LG Kavinder Gupta accused demonstrators of trying to set a paramilitary vehicle on fire and blamed “outsiders” and climate activist Sonam Wangchuk’s “provocative” statements for inflaming youth.Wangchuk held a hunger strike from Sept 9 for Sixth Schedule and statehood, which he ended Wednesday.Sixth Schedule in the Constitution grants tribal areas in the Northeast autonomy over land, resources and culture. Ladakhis have sought similar protections since 2019 when J&K was carved into two Union territories, including Ladakh. Talks with a high-powered committee set up by Centre in 2023 yielded only a domicile policy. Another round is due Oct 6, but delays have fuelled anger.Ladakh MP Haji Mohammad Haneefa Jan demanded an investigation into the use of bullets and pellets, calling the force “disproportionate”. Speaking in Kargil, where a shutdown was observed on the call of Kargil Democratic Alliance, he said govt delays in dialogue had frustrated youth. Kargil district magistrate imposed curfew Thursday morning.J&K CM Omar Abdullah urged restraint. “They should adopt the path of peace, and govt should pay attention to their legitimate demands,” he said, adding that authorities must examine “why such situations arise instead of blaming others”.In Srinagar, National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah rejected LG’s claims of outside involvement. “China is on our doorstep and has already taken control of much of our land. It is better to resolve the issue through dialogue,” he said.Congress veteran Karan Singh, son of J&K’s last Dogra ruler, appealed to Ladakhis to remain calm and urged govt to consider constitutional safeguards. “Inclusion in something like the Sixth Schedule seems an eminently reasonable solution,” he said.Congress functionaries from J&K and Ladakh blamed BJP and Centre for ignoring demands over land, culture, jobs and political rights. “Now indulging in blame game is part of their diversionary tactics… it is an insult to the peaceful people of Ladakh,” they said in a joint statement.","Police detained 48 people during pre-dawn searches thursday after four protesters were killed and more than 80 wounded.

What Priya Kapur has argued



NEW DELHI: What began as a story of grief and loss with the sudden death of businessman Sunjay Kapur has quickly spiraled into one of India’s most high-profile inheritance battles. When Sunjay Kapur collapsed during a polo match in Windsor this June, condolences quickly gave way to courtroom drama. His sprawling empire, nearly Rs 30,000 crore, is now at the heart of a bitter feud involving his widow Priya Sachdev Kapur, his 80-year-old mother, Rani Kapur, and his children with actor Karisma Kapoor And the claims are only getting sharper with each passing day. In the latest, lawyers for Sunjay’s teenage children Samaira and Kiaan have alleged that their father’s disclosed bank accounts had already been ""wiped clean"".Priya has however moved a plea in Delhi high court to submit her late husband’s full asset list in a sealed cover or in the alternative, constitution of Confidentiality Club. She has cited fears of leaks and misuse. The court said filing the list of personal assets and liabilities in a sealed cover may be ""problematic"" since his two children with former wife and actor Karisma Kapoor have a ""right to question the assets disclosed.The judge has directed Priya to file a complete disclosure of Sunjay’s assets and liabilities as of June 12, the day of his sudden death.Sunjay Kapur, chairman of Sona BLW Precision Forgings (Sona Comstar), was among India’s leading auto component tycoons. His profile extended beyond boardrooms: his marriages, first to designer Nandita Mahtani, then to actor Karisma Kapoor, and finally to fashion entrepreneur Priya Sachdev, kept him firmly in the public eye.The 53-year-old industrialist died suddenly on June 12 in Windsor, England, after collapsing mid-match at the prestigious Guards Polo Club. He reportedly swallowed a bee during the polo match that triggered a fatal heart attack.At the heart of the dispute is Sunjay Kapur’s estimated Rs 30,000 crore estate, comprising shares, properties, business holdings, and family trusts.Following his death, the division of assets became a legal and emotional battleground between his widow Priya, his two children with Karisma Kapoor (Samaira and Kiaan), his mother Rani Kapur, and Priya’s own child, all seeking their fair share.The matriarch of the family and widow of late industrialist Surinder Kapur, founder of the Sona Group. After her son’s passing, Rani publicly questioned Priya Sachdev Kapur’s control over Aureus Investment and opposed her appointment to the company’s board. In a letter dated July 24, she voiced strong concerns about how affairs were being managed following Sunjay’s death.: Samaira and Kiaan are Sunjay and Karisma’s children. Both live with their mother in Mumbai. Samaira and Kiaan Raj have challenged Sunjay's purported will and sought shares in his assets reportedly worth Rs 30,000 crore. Priya, meanwhile, informed the court that they have already received Rs 1,900 crore from the family trust.: A year after his divorce from Karisma, Sunjay married model-turned-entrepreneur Priya Sachdev. The couple has a son, Azarias. Priya has positioned herself as the defender of both her late husband’s legacy and her son’s rightful share in the estate, but her moves have drawn resistance from both Rani Kapur and Sunjay’s children with Karisma.Sunjay Kapur’s death triggered a flurry of legal manoeuvring. In July, Sona Comstar held its Annual General Meeting (AGM), brushing aside an emotional plea from Rani Kapur to delay the proceedings.Rani Kapur, in a letter, had asked the board to postpone the AGM by two weeks. Her reason? The family was still reeling from Sunjay’s death and critical decisions about control and legacy were being rushed through behind her back. In her letter to the board and shareholders, Rani called the AGM ""insensitive,"" accusing unnamed individuals of exploiting the family's tragedy to ""wrest control"" of the company and install their preferred nominees.Sona Comstar, however, didn’t blink. In a sharply worded response, the company said the AGM was conducted in ""full legal and regulatory compliance."" It dismissed Rani Kapur’s objections, stating that she hadn’t been a shareholder ""since at least 2019.""The inheritance battle reached the Delhi high court as Karisma Kapoor's children filed a plea seeking their rightful share.At the heart of the suit is a disputed will dated March 21, 2025, which leaves Sunjay’s entire personal estate to his widow Priya Sachdev Kapur. The children have contested the will, calling it ""forged, fabricated, and surrounded by suspicious circumstances.""According to the plaint, Sunjay never disclosed the existence of such a will during his lifetime, and neither Priya nor any other family member mentioned it until after his death. The filing alleged that Priya’s conduct demonstrated ""without a doubt: that the document has been fabricated.""The children have sought partition of assets, rendition of accounts, and a permanent injunction restraining Priya from selling or encumbering the estate. They also flagged a lack of transparency, telling the court they do not have complete information about their father’s assets at the time of his passing in June 2025.Priya Kapur has denied the allegations and her lawyers have argued that there is enough evidence to show the will in question was created and executed much before her husband's death.Kapur's lawyers have also disclosed that assets worth around Rs 1,900 crore have been transferred to the plaintiff siblings and that Karisma Kapoor and Sunjay Kapur’s marriage culminated in a bitter divorce after which she was ""nowhere to be seen"".The court will resume the hearing on the matter on Friday.","Priya sachdev kapur steps into public eye amid ₹30,000 crore sunjay kapur estate feud.

Congress raises Mandal pitch as Kharge slams caste rally ban in UP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-raises-mandal-pitch-as-kharge-slams-caste-rally-ban-in-up/articleshow/124133354.cms,"Mallikarjun Kharge (File photo)

NEW DELHI: After aggressive advocacy of caste census, removal of 50% ceiling on reservations and private sector quota, Congress has asserted its new branding as a ""social justice"" platform by slamming UP govt's ban on caste-based political rallies.In a little-noticed statement, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, at a CWC meet in Patna, asked PM Modi to answer how does the all-round acceptance of caste census square up with threat to jail people who come out to protest against atrocities inflicted on them. By linking the ban to UP CM Yogi Adityanath ""who has written in the past against reservations"", Kharge sought to paint caste rallies as part of protest and mobilisation rooted in caste injustices - in support for the now-banned gatherings.The reaction from the AICC chief has been stronger than the words of protest murmured by some regional parties of Mandal hue.But insiders said it is in line with the new politics, being pursued by Congress with a special nudge from Rahul Gandhi, who has found a strong ally in the party president. Since his debut, Rahul followed aggressive ""pro-poor politics"" with an element of Dalits and weaker sections. However, things took a dramatic turn over two years ago when he shifted gears to whole-heartedly embrace Mandalite fervour, with features like caste census and reservations.","Congress has asserted its new branding as a ""social justice"" platform by slamming up govt's ban on caste-based political rallies.

Authorities there issued a death certificate citing drowning, but a nine-member SIT was formed after a wave of 55 FIRs and mounting public outrage.Police said FIRs have been filed against four men: North East India Festival organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta, who invited Garg to Singapore; his manager Siddharth Sarma, attached to a Mumbai-based talent management firm; drummer Shekharjyoti Goswami; and businessman Sanjive Narain.SIT head and special DGP (CID) MP Gupta said Goswami, who was present when Garg drowned, was questioned at his Guwahati residence. Searches were carried out at the houses of Mahanta and Siddharth, though both were unavailable.A crowd gathered outside Siddharth's apartment and some threw stones at police vehicles.On Sept 20, the singer's wife Garima Saikia Garg had pleaded for withdrawal of all FIRs against Siddharth. ""Please allow Siddharth to be part of Zubeen's final journey. I request everyone to set aside negative thoughts about him. I will need his support - without him, I cannot do anything,"" she said. She credited him with caring for Garg during his 2020 epileptic seizure and the Covid lockdown, even bringing him from Mumbai by bus for treatment.He said Mahanta and Siddharth were not in Guwahati, urged for calm and warned against mob justice. ""If someone wants instant justice, we will face defeat before court. Emotion will not work. Anyone with leads may contact CID. If SIT cannot unearth all facts, we will hand it to CBI,"" he said.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has said that criminal law cannot become a platform for initiation of vindictive proceedings to settle personal scores and vendettas, and derided the increasing resort to lodging of FIRs to settle civil disputes.While quashing an FIR lodged more than two decades ago for the offence of cheating in a land transaction case, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan said, ""In recent years, the machinery of criminal justice is being misused by certain persons for their vested interests and for achieving their oblique motives and agenda.""While Jharkhand high court took 15 years to dismiss the plea for quashing of the FIR, SC took another six years to reverse the HC verdict.Writing the judgment, Justice Nagarathna said given the misuse of criminal law, ""courts have to be vigilant against such tendencies"". tnnChiding the complainant for his inability to prove charges against the appellant, court said such actions ""create significant divisions & distrust among people while also placing an unnecessary strain on the judicial system, particularly criminal courts"".Justice Nagarathna said courts must ensure that such ""acts of omission and commission having an adverse impact on the fabric of our society must be nipped in the bud"".The bench said every act of breach of trust may not result in a penal offence unless there is evidence of a manipulating act of fraudulent misappropriation of property.

Out of 757 villages across 15 districts in Bihar, Rajasthan, Assam, Karnataka and Maharashtra surveyed for the report, 707 reported instances of child marriage. The villages were randomly selected from the database of NGO network 'Just Rights for Childrens', which works on the issue.During the survey, 1,042 respondents, including panchayti raj institution members, school teachers, anganwadi workers and NGO staff, were interviewed. The report prepared by Centre for Legal Action and Behavioural Change for Children was released on Thursday at a side event of UNGA in New York.The report also put out estimates that show number of cases involving girls marrying before 18 declined from 3,861 in 2022-23 to 2,379 in 2023-24 to 1,195 in 2024-25.

Factors which lead to child marriage also include limited parental awareness or intellectual maturity (28% respondents), inadequate educational opportunities for girls (27%), and restricted occupational prospects (21%), securing a good match (33% ), cultural or traditional practices (20%), controlling sexual behavior and premarital pregnancy (15%), perceiving girls as a burden (15%).Nearly all respondents identified awareness campaigns and compulsory education as most impactful interventions to prevent child marriage.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab and Haryana HC said drunk driving cannot be viewed in isolation as a mere act of mischief as it is a grave menace to public safety and ""strikes at the very root of societal order"", and denied bail to a trucker accused of crushing an MBBS student while driving under the influence two years ago.Such cases need to be dealt with sternly and any leniency will send a wrong signal and embolden others to indulge in similar hazardous conduct, Justice Sumeet Goel said.""A person who chooses to drive under the influence of alcohol does not merely endanger his own life but recklessly imperils the lives of innocent citizens using the road,"" HC said in a recent order.Justice Goel was hearing a bail plea filed by trucker Jagtar Singh, who is accused of driving drunk, and ramming a parked car at high speed, killing a medical student. The accused was caught at the scene but managed to flee. He was eventually remanded in jail.The victim's father filed a complaint in Patiala after which police registered an FIR on Nov 1, 2023, under IPC and Motor Vehicles Act.Jagtar sought regular bail, saying he had been behind bars for more than a year and the challan against him already presented.Opposing the plea, the state argued the petitioner could influence or threaten witnesses if released on bail.It contended the petitioner did not deserve bail.Justice Goel held the gravity of offence, manner of its commission, and its impact on society must weigh against the plea of liberty.""Though the challan has been presented and 14 prosecution witnesses remain to be examined, the apprehension expressed by state that the petitioner, if released on bail, may attempt to influence or intimidate the witnesses cannot be brushed aside,"" said the judge, and dismissed Jagtar's plea.","Punjab and haryana hc said drunk driving cannot be viewed in isolation as a mere act of mischief.

Interestingly, the state with the lowest proportion of 5-9-year-old children with high triglycerides was Kerala (16.6%).The proportion was much lower among adolescents in the 10-19 years age group.
