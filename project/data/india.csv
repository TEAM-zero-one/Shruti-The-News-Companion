Amul's 'liquid infant formula' violates IMS Act: Activists to government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amuls-liquid-infant-formula-violates-ims-act-activists-to-govt/articleshow/121528207.cms,"Representative image

Amul's widely publicised launch of ""India's first liquid infant formula"" has outraged activists who have complained to the government that it is a violation of the Infant Milk Substitutes (IMS) Act. The Act prohibits the promotion of any breastmilk substitute meant for children below two years of age.The launch of Amul's liquid ready-to-feed infant milk substitute and its coverage in the media highlighted its convenience, particularly describing it as ""ideal to carry"" and ""good for working mothers"". ""Such framing directly positions the product as a substitute for breastfeeding and this action as promotion,"" argued public health activists who have complained to the secretaries of the women and child development ministry, the health ministry, the CEO of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), and chairperson of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights.In response to the objections, Amul tweeted: ""Amulspray is one of India's oldest and most trusted infant milk food brands and is in complete compliance of the IMS Act..."".Public health advocates argued that Amul's actions constitute a clear case of promotion of an infant milk substitute - an act explicitly prohibited under Section 3(c) of the IMS Act, which states: ""No person shall... take part in the promotion of infant milk substitutes, feeding bottles or infant foods"".The law also prohibits having any pictures or other graphic material or phrases designed to increase the saleability of infant milk substitute or infant food. Amul's use of a teddy bear graphic on the product's label could be considered a breach of this provision, they stated.The complaint has demanded an enquiry into the launch and promotion of Amul's product, immediate removal of the graphic of a teddy bear from the product label, media guidelines for IMS-compliant reporting and strong enforcement of the IMS Act.","Amul's widely publicised launch of ""india's first liquid infant formula"" has outraged activists.

Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) on Friday informed Supreme Court it had decided to scrap the tenders for the proposed Rs 6,000 crore Mumbai Elevated Road Project and the Rs 8,000 crore Road Tunnel Project.The matter reached SC after Larsen and Toubro challenged the decision of MMRDA to reject its technical bids for the projects.

Hold NEET-PG exam in one sitting; two papers can vary in difficulty: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hold-neet-pg-exam-in-one-sitting-two-papers-can-vary-in-difficulty-supreme-court/articleshow/121528154.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday directed the National Board of Examinations (NBE) to conduct the NEET-PG exam in one sitting for all 2.4 lakh candidates instead of the scheduled test in two shifts in 900 centres across India on June 15.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Kumar and N V Anjaria said it was not ready to accept that the body conducting the examination could not find enough centres to accommodate all candidates in one shift. ""Holding the examination in two shifts is arbitrary and does not allow candidates to have the same question paper. Any two different question papers will vary in their difficulty levels,"" the bench said.When counsel for NBE said the norm in IIT-JEE was to have multiple sets of question papers and then apply normalisation of marks according to difficulty levels of questions, SC said normalisation of marks could be adopted only in exceptional circumstances and not routinely year after year.It directed NBE to set up an adequate number of additional examination centres to conduct NEET-PG in one sitting. When the counsel said the process for identifying additional secure examination centres could result in postponing the June 15 exam date, the bench said if the authorities require postponement of the test for finding more centres, it would have to seek permission from the court.","The supreme court on friday directed the national board of examinations to conduct the neet-pg exam in one sitting for all 2.4 lakh candidates instead of the scheduled test in two shifts in 900 centres across india on june 15.

RAIPUR: The Chhattisgarh government has granted out-of-turn promotions to 295 police personnel in recognition of acts of bravery in combating Maoists as the state pushes on towards its goal of eliminating Naxal insurgency by March 2026.An order issued by DGP Arun Deo Gautam stated that police personnel who displayed exceptional courage during anti-Naxal operations across the region are being rewarded with accelerated promotions. Promotions have been given to lower and middle-rank personnel from the district police, Special Task Force (STF), and intelligence units.According to the order, 206 constables have been promoted to head constables and 37 head constables to assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs). Fifteen ASIs are now SIs, and 16 SIs are inspectors. Three platoon commanders have been promoted to company commanders, six assistant platoon commanders have been elevated to platoon commanders, and three dozen personnel have been promoted to assistant platoon commanders.Sharing the order copy on social media, deputy chief minister Vijay Sharma, who is also the home minister, said, ""All the security personnel have displayed indomitable courage and bravery while fighting on the frontlines against Maoists to protect the Constitution and democracy.With the strength of soldiers, the future is definitely filled with development, happiness, peace and new enthusiasm in Bastar.""Later, Sharma told reporters, ""The era of Red terror in Bastar is coming to an end, thanks to the unmatched bravery of the state's security forces.""As per Chhattisgarh police records, 425 Maoists have been killed in encounters, 1,444 arrested, and 1,406 have surrendered since last year.","Cops get swift promotions in chhattisgarh for anti-maoist ops.

"'She wanted to escape': How 100 witnesses, exhaustive evidence exposed VIP cover-up, led to justice in Rishikesh resort murder case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/she-wanted-to-escape-how-100-witnesses-exhaustive-evidence-exposed-vip-cover-up-led-to-justice-in-rishikesh-resort-murder-case/articleshow/121520903.cms,"NEW DELHI: The verdict arrived like a long-awaited storm in Kotdwar’s courtroom, quiet but crushing. More than two years and eight months after a 19-year-old receptionist was murdered in cold blood, the gavel finally fell. Resort owner Pulkit Arya, along with Saurabh Bhaskar and Ankit Gupta, was sentenced to life imprisonment.For those who had followed the case, one that had stunned Uttarakhand and the nation, it was a grim vindication. The verdict, delivered by the additional district and sessions judge, came after a painstaking trial involving around 100 witnesses of which 47 were produced in court with their testimonies stretching over nearly three years.The charges were as damning as the headlines that once blazed across national media. The trio stood convicted under multiple sections of murder, destruction of evidence, criminal conspiracy, and sexual harassment. The court also found them guilty under the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act, lending judicial weight to early suspicions that the Vanantra Resort in Rishikesh, where the victim worked, was a front for something far darker.One witness didn’t mince words, calling the resort “a den of vice.”The girl had only been 19, employed at a property owned by Pulkit Arya, son of a now-expelled BJP leader. In the weeks before her death, she had reached out to those she trusted. A former colleague and a close friend both later revealed she had confided in them - terrified, desperate, and deeply uneasy. She told them she was being pushed to provide “special services” to an incoming VIP guest.“She wanted to escape from there,” said an officer from the Special Investigation Team (SIT), which later took over the probe.But she never got the chance. On September 18, 2022, she was killed for refusing those demands. Her body surfaced six days later, dumped in the Chilla canal. The crime, horrifying in its brutality and made more incendiary by the accused’s political connections, lit a fuse of public outrage. Protests broke out across the state. A high-level investigation was ordered.At the centre of it all was the SIT, led by DIG P Renuka Devi. Their investigation produced a 500-page chargesheet. The evidence was exhaustive: about 100 witness statements and 30 pieces of documentary proof. Yet, it was two voices that ultimately helped crack the case wide open - the victim’s confidantes. Her friend and the ex-employee both confirmed what she had feared: the resort was not what it seemed, and she was desperate to leave.Initially, much of what was known came from WhatsApp chats with her friend, some of which were later leaked online. But investigators discovered she had also spoken to the former employee, warning them about the illegal activities at the resort and her fear of being forced to serve a powerful, unnamed VIP.Senior officers later confirmed that narco-tests were requested for the accused in hopes of identifying this shadowy figure. His name, even today, remains unknown.When the day of the verdict arrived, Pauri Garhwal’s courtroom was transformed. Security was tight. Officers from nearby districts were brought in. The area around the courthouse was designated a “zero zone” - a perimeter of 100 metres where only government staff and approved attendees were allowed entry.Outside, emotions overflowed. Soni Devi, the victim’s mother, broke down as she addressed the media. “May the criminals be sentenced to death,” she told ANI. Her words rang heavy with grief and fury, echoing the pain that first gripped Uttarakhand back in 2022 and the demand for justice that never wavered.","Pulkit arya, saurabh bhaskar and ankit gupta sentenced to life imprisonment.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra police have launched a probe against a senior doctor in Latur for allegedly directing a colleague to ""kill"" a Covid patient during the pandemic in 2021.According to officials, the probe follows the release of an audio clip of a conversation between the accused, Dr. Shashikant Deshpande, and Dr. Shashikant Dange on social media platforms.Dr Deshpande was then posted as additional district surgeon at the Udgir Government Hospital in Latur, while Dr Dange, who was posted at a Covid-19 care centre, news agency PTI reported.In the conversation, Dr Deshpande was heard saying, ""Don't allow anyone to go inside, just kill that Dayami woman,"" To this, Dr Dange responded cautiously, noting that oxygen support had already been reduced.The patient, Kausar Fatima, wife of Dayami Ajimoddin Gaussoddin (53), had later recovered from the disease.After a complaint, the Udgir city police filed an FIR against Deshpande on May 24 under legal provisions for deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings and other offences.As per the FIR, the complainant said that in 2021, during the pandemic, his wife Kausar Fatima (then aged 41), tested positive for Covid.She was admitted as an inpatient at the government hospital in Udgir on April 15, 2021, and Covid treatment was being provided in a building opposite an eye hospital on Nanded Road, under the management of the hospital. Dr Dange was treating Covid-19 patients at that centre.The woman remained admitted there for 10 days. Around the seventh day of her admission, her husband was sitting beside Dr Dange while he was having lunch.At that moment, Dr Dange, who received a call from Dr Deshpande, placed the phone on speaker and continued the conversation regarding hospital matters.During the call, Dr Deshpande enquired about bed availability.When Dr Dange informed him that there were no vacant beds, the man claimed that he distinctly heard Dr Deshpande saying, ""Kill the Dayami patient. You're used to dealing with such people."" He also allegedly made a caste-based slur during the conversation, as per the man's complaint.The man said he was shocked, but chose to remain silent at the time since his wife was still undergoing treatment. A few days later, his wife recovered and was discharged.However, on May 2, 2025, the audio clip of the purported conversation surfaced on social media.The man said hearing the same disturbing remarks again deeply hurt him and offended his religious sentiments, especially the alleged use of derogatory caste-related comments, following which he lodged the police complaint.According to officials, Deshpande's statement has been recorded and his phone has been seized.According to inspector Dilip Gade, the police were verifying the authenticity of the audio clip.""He is out of district and will come tomorrow. After that, we will collect his mobile phone and conduct an inquiry,"" Gade said.","Dr shashikant deshpande allegedly directed a colleague to ""kill"" a covid patient during the pandemic in 2021.

She further went on to add, ""why are you not giving sindoor to your Mrs first?""During his rally in West Bengal, the Prime Minister had declared from the ""sacred land of Sindoor Khela"" the rousing success of India's Operation Sindoor. He went on to explain the powerful symbolism behind the naming of the operation. The Prime Minister said that the Army had given an emphatic response to the terrorist who had dared to ""wipe away the sindoor of our sisters.""BJP's Patra during the press briefing also discredited reports that the BJP was planning to distribute vermilion (sindoor) to women to mark the Modi government’s anniversary. He accused opposition parties of using it to discredit the Centre’s anti-terror operation.“They are belittling India's military action for political gains,” he said.Amit Malviya, head of the BJP’s IT cell, also called the report fabricated and accused Banerjee of behaving “like a troll”. Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate responded by saying the BJP had only disowned the sindoor campaign after facing backlash.The West Bengal CM's remarks had followed PM Modi’s rally in Alipurduar where he launched a fierce attack on the TMC government, alleging that it had failed on multiple fronts including women’s safety, youth employment, and corruption. He cited recent communal violence in Murshidabad and Malda as evidence of lawlessness under the TMC.Banerjee hit back, alleging that the BJP had orchestrated the Murshidabad and Malda unrest and that Modi was trying to divide the country. “In Bengal, we have a humanitarian government.

GUWAHATI: Assam's BJP-led government has accelerated the process of tracking down individuals declared illegal foreigners by Foreigners' Tribunals and is pushing them back into the no-man's land between India and Bangladesh.At least 49 such ""declared foreign nationals"" were pushed back from western and southern Assam on May 27 and 29, after which at least three petitioners have separately moved the Supreme Court and Gauhati HC seeking the whereabouts of their family members, suspected to have been pushed back, and a halt to the ongoing drive.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Friday that ""30,000 people, after being declared foreign nationals by various tribunals over the years, have disappeared. We have decided to speed up the process of detecting them, which was paused when the NRC was being updated.The moment we get them, we have to take action and we are working as per law"".Sarma said that in coming days there would be a lot of push-backs, and added that a declared foreigner could appeal in HC or SC. ""If one has not preferred an appeal in the higher court, his right to stay in India is forfeited. But if a declared foreigner can show that he has made an appeal, we are not disturbing him,"" he said.""If judiciary has given a stay (on the tribunal order declaring them foreigners), we are respecting the judiciary and we have allowed such people to stay,"" Sarma said.Sarma said that there were two types of illegals - people who have just come in and those who have been declared foreigners by tribunals.""The SC ordered (in Feb) that those declared foreigners and have not made any appeal should be sent back by any means. Only yesterday 35 Bangladeshis who came in a few days ago were detected near the border with Meghalaya, in Silchar, and were immediate pushed back,"" he said.On Thursday, Gauhati HC issued notice to the state government directing it to provide details of the whereabouts of two brothers who were declared foreigners by a tribunal and subsequently released on conditional bail. One Torap Ali, nephew of Abu Bakkar Siddik and Akbar Ali, claimed in his petition that his family apprehends both his uncles ""may be in danger of being illegally pushed into Bangladesh"".The two were declared foreigners by a tribunal in 2017 and sent to a transit camp in Goalpara. They were released on bail in 2020 following an SC directive that those in detention for over two years may be released on bail. They were detained by police on May 24, the petitioner submitted, and claimed that the authorities have refused to give details of their whereabouts. The court has fixed the next hearing for June 4.Similarly, SC said on Friday it would hear on Monday a habeas corpus petition filed by a 26-year-old man stating that his mother, Monowara Bewa of Dhubri, also a declared foreigner, was detained by police on May 24 and since then her whereabouts were unknown.","Assam picking up b'deshi illegals, dumping them in no-man's land between india and bangladesh.

PUNE: The first batch of 17 women National Defence Academy (NDA) cadets passed out Friday, scripting a new chapter in the annals of the Indian Armed Forces.Unlike previous parades during their three years at the academy, when they had a separate contingent, the 17 marched with male cadets at the Pune academy's Arun Khetarpal Parade Grounds, indistinguishable from their military crew haircut and confident stride.The passing-out parade (PoP) marked a culmination of the hard work, determination, motivation and high standards of physical fitness. The women, part of a total of 336 cadets who passed out, celebrated later with a ""push-up"" competition.Former Army chief and Mizoram governor V K Singh, who reviewed the parade, described it as a unique moment in NDA's history. ""These young women are the inimitable symbol of nari shakti, embodying not just women's development but women-led development. I envision a future not far from now when one of these women rises to the highest echelon of the service they go to. The moment shows the uniqueness of the NDA as we could not distinguish male and female cadets during the parade,"" said Singh, who passed out of NDA in 1969.Academy Cadet Captain Udayveer Singh Negi, who commanded the parade, echoed the views. ""The women cadets performed well. They outshone male cadets in many aspects,"" Negi said.The hours-long rehearsals for the parade in scorching heat and rain culminated with impressive results, said Ishita Singh, one of the women cadets. ""PoP is one of the most important events in military life. I always wanted to celebrate this occasion in front of my parents and dear ones. Today, I could fulfil my wish,"" Ishita told TOI.According to NDA commandant Gurcharan Singh, when girls first came to the academy, they were staying separately. ""Today, they are integrated completely with squadrons and battalions. They are running, playing and training together. Every activity is gender-neutral,"" Gurcharan said.The parents could not be more delighted. ""My daughter is not only mine now. She is the daughter of the nation. She is our only daughter. When she decided to join NDA, we supported her. She was inspired by her grandfather, who had served in the Army,"" said Ashok Mehalan, father of cadet Sheetal Mehalan and businessman from Rohtak in Haryana.According to C Sangwan, father of cadet Ishita, his daughter has given him ""a new identity"". ""When we got to know about entry for women in NDA, we asked her to submit her form 20 days before the exam. She cleared it. Today, she proved her mettle and made us very proud,"" said Sangwan, who hails from Jhunjhunu in Rajasthan.Ajit Duhan, father of Ritul Duhan, the first Battalion Cadet Captain of the women's batch, fell ""short of words to praise her achievement"".

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court Friday greenlighted Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai's theme garden that came up at the site of the more than 100-year-old Khajuria lake in Kandivali (West), overturning a 2018 judgment of the Bombay HC directing the Maharashtra government and MCGM to demolish the constructions and restore the lake.However, SC asked MCGM to maintain and preserve the existing park as a green area in perpetuity, exclusively for public use without any predominant commercial activity. The park serves as a vital recreational nucleus for children, offering them safe spaces for play and physical activity; provides senior citizens dedicated areas for walking and social interaction; and creates opportunities for community engagement and leisure. A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh also directed MCGM to ""constitute an expert committee within three months to explore the feasibility of developing an alternative water body in nearby areas to compensate for the ecological functions of the original water body"".Writing the judgment, Justice Kant further asked MCGM to undertake a comprehensive exercise within a year for the ecological restoration of water bodies that are dying, and file compliance reports before HC.It requested HC ""to see that the directions issued by the SC are complied with in letter and spirit"".Interestingly, HC's 2018 judgment was passed by a bench of which Justice A S Oka, who retired recently as an SC judge, was a part. The case lingered on in the SC, with the verdict finally delivered five days after Justice Oka's retirement. Allowing MCGM's appeal, the bench said though HC's views were well-intentioned and, prima facie, a correct interpretation of settled notions such as the public trust doctrine, they required reconsideration through the ""prism of practical realities and evolved ground conditions"". Justice Kant said, ""There cannot be a simplistic binary choice between a park or a pond, as each serves distinct ecological and social functions contingent upon specific circumstances, geographical location, and evolving usage patterns"".The verdant recreational park that came up over the so-called lake, one that had been reduced to a garbage dump over the years and could not support flora and fauna, is now a well-maintained urban oasis, teeming with mature trees, as the appeals are being finally decided more than 15 years after it came up at the site, he added. ""It provides an essential green space in an increasingly concretised urban environment, with trees and other foliage contributing significantly to oxygen generation, air purification, and microclimate regulation,"" the bench said.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday affirmed the Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Corporation's decision to cancel allotment of 125 acres of land in Sultanpur to Kamla Nehru Memorial Trust (KNMT), named after Congress politician Rahul Gandhi's great grandmother, saying a huge tract of industrial land was allotted without evaluating benefits to the public.Dismissing KNMT's appeal, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said that though the land was allotted in 2003, the trust failed to make timely payment of the cost of the land and kept seeking ""unwarranted concessions, including waiver of interest and rescheduling of dues"". It also cancelled the subsequent allotment of the same land to Jagdishpur Paper Mills.Terming KNMT a chronic defaulter, the bench said, ""UPSIDC's action in treating KNMT as a defaulter was, therefore, both justified and necessary to preserve the integrity of the allotment process. Allowing such deliberate defaults to persist unchecked would undermine the entire framework of land allocation and set a detrimental precedent.""Writing the judgment, Justice Kant faulted UPSIDC for not following the public trust doctrine in allotment of lands. ""While we have upheld the cancellation due to KNMT's default, the circumstances reveal systemic concerns in the original allocation process. UPSIDC allotted the land to KNMT within merely two months of application (in 2003), raising questions about the thoroughness of the evaluation.Furthermore, during the pendency of this dispute, UPSIDC demonstrated remarkable alacrity in considering alternative allotments to Jagdishpur Paper Mills Ltd,"" it said.Justice Kant said the public trust doctrine required that allocations must be preceded by a thorough assessment of public benefits, beneficiary credentials, and safeguards ensuring continued compliance with stated purposes.

This betrays the fiduciary relationship between the State and its citizens,"" it said.SC directed the UP government and UPSIDC to ensure that all future land allotments must be made in a transparent, non-discriminatory and fair manner, and fetched maximum revenue while achieving the larger public interests - industrial development, environmental sustainability and regional economic objectives.","Supreme court: up nixing land allotment to kamla nehru trust justified.

NEW DELHI: In a span of just a month, PM Narendra Modi has twice taken top central government bureaucrats and state chief secretaries by surprise by flagging public grievances that had reached him directly, reports Dipak Dash.On April 30, secretaries and chief secretaries attending a meeting under Pragati - the performance audit PM holds periodically - were surprised when Modi raised shortcomings in the implementation of the Jal Jeevan Mission, a scheme to reach piped water to all households.On Wednesday, he again left them amazed when, during a review of the functioning of real estate regulators, he shared feedback that files in RERA offices don't move unless ""vyavastha"", a popular Hindu euphemism for pleasing the authorities, has been made.Senior officials said the two meetings, apart from providing a peek into the PM's continuing connect with the grassroots, were also symbolic of the government's decision to focus on problems which are holding up last-mile delivery of well-intentioned schemes. This also helps explain, sources said, why the 11th anniversary of the Modi govt passed without large-scale events or publicity campaigns.","Pm narendra modi has twice taken top central government bureaucrats by surprise by flagging public grievances that had reached him directly.

BENGALURU: Congress in Karnataka is heading into a critical phase as internal tensions between CM Siddaramaiah and deputy, DK Shivakumar , escalate, raising concerns about the stability of the govt and the party's long-term prospects, reports Manu Aiyappa Kanathanda.At the heart of the conflict is the unresolved issue of a change of guard. An unwritten understanding is believed to have been reached when Congress formed the government in May 2023 - that Siddaramaiah would serve as CM for two-and-a-half years, after which Shivakumar would take over. If honoured, this transition would take place in Nov.However, with no official word from party high command and no signs of preparation for a handover, the issue is becoming increasingly contentious. Both netas remain indispensable to Congress in Karnataka - Siddaramaiah with his Ahinda (backward classes, minorities and Dalits) clout and administrative experience, and Shivakumar with his fundraising abilities and control over the organisation. Buoyed by loyal support, Siddaramaiah is showing no signs of stepping aside. Instead, he is consolidating his position and intends to serve a full term, sources say.This has left Shivakumar's camp testy. The latest face-off was the transfer of engineers from the water resources department which he oversees. Shivakumar's decision to record his displeasure in writing marks a significant shift. Sources say the move signals a deliberate attempt to assert his position.""The fact that he put it in writing is a message to the party,"" said a senior Congress functionary. ""He's not going to remain passive as the CM strengthens his grip.""It is said Shivakumar views the reassignments as an effort to weaken his administrative authority. The timing of the rift, too, is significant. ""Siddaramaiah believes these developments are part of a larger plan to push him out. His focus now is to prove that his leadership remains strong and that he can withstand political and personal attacks,"" said an MLA from Bengaluru.","Internal tensions between cm siddaramaiah and deputy, dk shivakumar, escalate.

RAIPUR: At a time when all of Bastar is on high alert following the loot of 5,000kg explosives by Maoists in neighbouring Odisha, three villagers were grievously injured in an IED blast in Chhattisgarh's insurgency-hit Bijapur district Friday morning.This is the first attack on civilians since the encounter killing of CPI(Maoist) general secretary Basavaraju on May 21.Police identified the trio as Vivek Dhodi (17), Badde Sunil (20), and Gote Joga (45), of Erragufa Para in Madded region, around 470km from Raipur, close to the Maharashtra border.The blast occurred between 8.30am and 9 am when they were walking to nearby Bandepara village. All three were riddled with splinters in their legs and faces. Maoists indiscriminately plant IEDs, even on paths frequented by villagers. On March 31 this year, a tribal woman was killed by a Maoist IED near a village in Bijapur, less than 24 hours after a woman lost a leg in one such explosion in the same district.After learning about the incident, the authorities sent an ambulance to the spot, and efforts were made to shift the victims to the hospital, the official said.",Three villagers were grievously injured in an ied blast in chhattisgarh's insurgency-hit bijapur district.

KOLKATA: Calcutta high court rapped a city college for cancelling an economics professor's child care leave (CCL) of six months, availed to look after her one year old twin daughters, and withholding her salary for the period.""If nourishing years of the two infants are not the right time to grant CCL to petitioner, then one wonders whether the governing body of the college was trying to save it for a later period, when there may possibly be no need for such leave,"" Justice Jay Sengupta observed in his May 19 order.HC directed Calcutta Girls College authorities to sanction 189 days of CCL to the assistant professor, and release her salary dues for the period within six weeks. Denying the petitioner such leave would amount to flouting the applicable law, the bench ruled.The professor approached the high court after the college, in a decision on Jan 11, 2024, rejected her CCL availed from Jan 11 to July 18, 2023, and directed her to refund the salary received during that period.The petitioner stated that she took maternity leave of 180 days from Nov 12, 2021 to May 10, 2022. She gave birth to the twins via C-section on Nov 26, 2021.She returned to work on May 11, 2022, and on the same day, applied for child care leave to look after her daughters at her Siliguri home, as her husband was abroad and elderly parents-in-law were ill.She was granted and availed CCL from Jan 11 to July 18, 2023. Suffering from post-pregnancy issues, she again applied for CCL from July 21 to Oct 31, 2023, which was sanctioned, and leave without pay from Nov 1, 2023 to Feb 29, 2024, which was approved. She resumed duties on March 1, 2024.According to the rules outlined in the memorandum of Jan 18, 2016, a woman employee is entitled to child care leave for a period of two years, i.e., 730 days, during her entire service period, until the eldest two of her children reach the age of 18 years. She can apply three times within a year, or apply at once for one year.The college submitted that petitioner went on CCL from Jan 11 to July 18, 2023, ""without following the proper rules, as per Calcutta University statutes and Acts"", and her salary for the disputed period was stopped ""due to her unauthorised leave"".However, the judge rejected the arguments and noted that the petitioner was well within her rights to claim CCL, and there was no reason for the college governing body not to have considered her application favourably.","Calcutta high court rapped a city college for cancelling an economics professor's child care leave.

LUCKNOW: A day after being assaulted in office by a joint commissioner, a deputy commissioner-level Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer accused the senior colleague of attacking him over a three-month-old dispute related to a departmental cricket match.An FIR was registered at Lucknow's Hazratganj police station on Friday over the incident, which allegedly also involved a strangulation bid.Complainant Gaurav Garg - a 2016-batch IRS officer posted at the income tax office in Hazratganj - alleged that joint commissioner Yogendra Kumar Mishra, currently posted in Uttarakhand's Kashipur, barged into the office on Thursday and launched a violent and premeditated assault in the presence of senior officers.Garg said the dispute dated back to Feb 13, when Mishra, then posted in Lucknow, allegedly insisted on being appointed as captain of the departmental cricket team during a tournament. After his request was denied, Mishra allegedly threatened to disrupt the match by squatting on the pitch.Garg alleged that Mishra continued to harass the team members on WhatsApp, sending messages like, ""I know about your sister's affair"", and ""Be careful, NCB is watching.""He even threatened to plant drugs to frame them, Garg claimed. Over a dozen complaints were reportedly filed, following which Mishra was transferred to Uttarakhand.The complainant alleged that on May 29, Mishra stormed into the office, where a farewell was being planned for the outgoing principal chief commissioner at a departmental meeting.According to the FIR, Mishra hurled abuses and demanded his transfer orders be revoked. He then picked up a glass tumbler, splashed water on Garg and attempted to stab him with the broken glass. When Garg tried to leave, Mishra allegedly grabbed him by the throat, choking him. ""He then punched me repeatedly, injuring my nose, lips and ear. He even kicked me in the groin,"" Garg alleged.Police were informed and Garg was rushed to the hospital. He remains under medical care, but submitted a written complaint to police on Friday.","An fir was registered at lucknow's hazratganj police station on friday over the incident, which allegedly also involved a strangulation bid.
