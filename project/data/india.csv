BENGALURU: Congress government in Karnataka Saturday constituted an SIT to probe allegations of large-scale deletion of voter names from the electoral rolls in Kalaburagi district's Aland assembly constituency during the 2023 state election.The SIT was formed after Aland Congress MLA B R Patil lodged a police complaint alleging that the names of 6,670 voters across 256 polling stations were unlawfully deleted. Verification by election officers revealed that applications were filed for deletion of 6,018 voters, but only 24 were genuine. The remaining 5,994 were allegedly filed using fake mobile numbers and without the knowledge of the voters concerned.The SIT will be headed by ADGP (CID) B K Singh and will include SPs Saidulu Adavath and Shubhanwita.The team has been given the power to probe all related cases across Karnataka, with assistance from the CID and local police. The move follows LS LoP Rahul Gandhi's claim that genuine voters in Aland were deliberately struck off the rolls.""Somebody tried to delete 6,018 voters' names through software manipulation and fake applications targeting minorities,"" Rahul had alleged, adding: ""Some force had hijacked the process and deleted the names.""Following Gandhi's charge, CM Siddaramaiah had also accused BJP of subverting democracy through systematic & centralised attempts at ""vote chori"". ""The Aland case is not an isolated incident, but a window to a larger conspiracy to manipulate electoral rolls & deny citizens their right to vote.""""For 18 months, Karnataka CID had been repeatedly urging EC to share certain technical details, such as IP addresses, device ports, OTP trails.

(Inputs from New Delhi)

BENGALURU: Karnataka State Backward Classes Commission has removed 57 Christian sub-castes from the socio-educational survey beginning Monday, following objections from ministers, protests by SC/ST and OBC groups, and a suggestion by governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot.The decision means the survey questionnaire will not list sub-castes. Enumerators using a mobile app between Sept 22 and Oct 7 will record such responses under ""others"". Officials said respondents may still disclose their original caste before conversion, but those entries will also be filed under ""others"".CM Siddaramaiah asked the commission to exclude the names after the governor warned the list could deepen divides. Opposition BJP had objected, alleging the exercise could dilute the anti-conversion law and extend reservations to converted Christians.""The new nomenclature will normalise conversion and encourage the gullible to convert without fear of losing caste identity,"" Karnataka BJP Minorities Morcha president Anil Thomas said Saturday.Samajika Nyaya Jagriti Vedike president S Harish accused Congress govt of plotting ""to integrate Christians into Hindu OBC communities"" and of ""labelling Hindu communities as Christians"".Backward classes welfare minister Shiavaraj Tangadagi countered that govt had not assigned labels: ""During Kantharaju Commission survey, participants voluntarily identified themselves as such. The confusion was sorted out.""Siddaramaiah sought to cool tensions: ""This survey is to capture social and educational backwardness of people and to find out their religion. If someone is a practising Christian, the person will be listed as Christian and not in terms of caste.""Congress is confident Karnataka's survey will follow Telangana's model, with no rollback on the broader policy.","Karnataka state backward classes commission has removed 57 christian sub-castes from the socio-educational survey beginning monday.

GURGAON: In yet another alarming incident of lawlessness in Gurgaon, unidentified assailants opened fire at the office of MNR Buildmark in Sector 45 late Thursday night.The attack, which took place around 9.30pm barely a few hundred meters from the Sector 40 police station, has raised serious concerns about security in the area.According to sources, four to five armed men scaled the iron gate of the premises and opened fire at the locked office.More than 15 rounds were fired, some of which struck two luxury cars — a Jaguar and a BMW — parked inside the compound. Security guards on duty rushed indoors to take cover. No casualties were reported.Soon after, gangster Deepak Nandal claimed responsibility for the attack, alleging that Nitin Talwar — a relative of Rohit Raheja, owner of MNR Buildmark — owed him money but had fled to New Zealand with his family in 2019.In a purported message, Nandal also warned others who owed him money and alleged that singer Rahul Yadav alias Fazilpuria had to return Rs 5 crore.Investigations have been complicated by the fact that the CCTV cameras at the premises were found to be non-functional at the time of the incident.Police teams, including a forensic unit and multiple CIA squads, reached the spot soon after the firing. Sub-Inspector Baljeet Singh confirmed that “multiple rounds were fired,” but stressed that no injuries occurred.The motive behind the attack remains under probe.","Unidentified assailants opened fire at the office of mnr buildmark in sector 45 late thursday night.

AHMEDABAD: A Gujarati woman was shot dead during a robbery attempt at her convenience store in Union County late Tuesday night.The victim was identified as Kiran Patel, 49, who ran DD's Food Mart on South Pinckney Street.Police said they received a call around 10.30pm about a man firing shots outside the store. When officers arrived, they found Patel lying unresponsive in the parking lot with gunshot wounds. Emergency medical services later confirmed her death.According to investigators, surveillance video captured the sequence of events.A masked man entered the store with a gun and demanded money from Patel, who was working alone.During the confrontation, the assailant fired a shot, and Patel tried to resist by throwing something at him. The robber then climbed onto the cash register counter and fired multiple rounds inside the store.Patel attempted to flee towards the parking lot, but the gunman chased her, continuing to shoot.She collapsed just 20 feet away from the store entrance after being struck by bullets. Officers also recovered shell casings and found the store's front window shattered.The Union County coroner's office confirmed Patel's identity and said she suffered fatal injuries from the gunfire.This tragedy comes at a time when the US is witnessing renewed debate over gun control laws.South Carolina, like many states, allows relatively easy access to firearms, and incidents of violence at small businesses have become frequent.

Paramjit Singh, an Indian who immigrated to the US more than 30 years ago, has been detained by the ICE and kept in custody for over a month now. Paramjit is a green card holder and has been doing business in Fort Wayne, Indiana, for the last three decades. He was detained at Chicago O'Hare Airport on July 30 as he was returning from a trip to India, as he makes trips to India several times a year.Singh's attorney Luis Angeles toldthat his detention was absolutely illegal and that the government is increasing his health risks as Singh has a brain tumor and heart issues.But why was Singh arrested in the first place? His attorney and family members said that the government cited an incident from the past when Singh used a pay phone without paying. It was a ""minor infraction for which he has already taken full accountability, served his time, and paid his debt to society,"" Angeles said.Also read: EB-5 investment visa cap reached for 2025, green card route paused till September 30 Narrating the harrowing details of what happened since Singh was detained, his family members revealed that he was kept inside the airport for five days.

Bihar polls announcement likely in first week of October,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-announcement-likely-in-first-week-of-october/articleshow/124021032.cms,"Caste data may fuel demand for sub-categories within OBCs

NEW DELHI: Election Commission is likely to announce the dates for the Bihar polls, which may be conducted in two phases, in the first week of October.The high-stakes showdown will test the governing NDA, led by CM Nitish Kumar , against a charged opposition, which is already in battle mode with Rahul Gandhi conducting a state-wide yatra against alleged vote theft, and RJD neta Tejashwi now leading another focused on unemployment and alleged corruption.This is Bihar's first state poll since Nitish government's landmark caste count in 2023, which has ignited fierce debates on social justice, reservations and power-sharing.For NDA, the elections are a chance to defy voter fatigue with a CM who has been at the helm for two decades now.Bihar’s elections have largely been fought along the fault lines of caste and the forthcoming round is unlikely to buck the pattern. The caste survey may have only sharpened the battle lines.Conducted under Nitish’s watch, it revealed that Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) comprise 63% of the population, with Yadavs at 14%, EBCs at 36%, and others, such as Kushwahas and Kurmis, accounting for the rest. SCs comprise 19%, while the upper castes account for 15%.Many groups among Muslims, who have a share of 17% in the population, are categorised as OBCs, but they mostly vote along community lines.Armed with this data, govt hiked reservations from 50% to 65% for jobs and education, plus 10% for economically weaker sections.The move, supposed to win over the numerically dominant “backwards”, was stayed by Patna HC but helped Nitish further fortify his credentials as a champion of OBCs. Centre’s surprise nod to a national caste census in April 2025, announced by BJP-led government, has added fresh fuel to the fire. Once wary of the demand, the Modi govt embraced it after concluding that doing so would defang what had become the chief plank of the opposition and prevent it from reversing the momentum for Hindu consolidation.The data could fuel demand for sub-categorisation within OBCs. Barring a sharp deviation from the historical pattern, the elections are likely to be shaped by the caste factor, and in this regard the NDA does not appear to be especially disadvantaged vis-àvis the rival combination if it manages to prevent the newcomer Jan Suraj from eating into its upper-caste votes.","The high-stakes showdown will test the governing nda, led by cm nitish kumar.

NEW DELHI: In a move to build India’s maritime power, reduce dependence on foreign ships and be future-ready to face any supply chain disruption, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced three schemes entailing govt investment of over Rs 70,000 crore to boost the shipbuilding sector. These are a part of the govt’s agenda to propel India into the top 10 countries globally for both shipbuilding and ship ownership, and increase three-fold the share of global port cargo at Indian ports.At present, India ranks 16th globally in both shipbuilding and ship ownership, and only 7% of Indian-owned ships are built in India. Data also shows that the share of export-import (EXIM) cargo carried on Indian ships has declined sharply from 41% in FY1988 to just 5% in FY2023.In his address at Bhavnagar on Saturday, PM Modi said this has resulted in India paying approximately Rs 6 lakh crore annually to foreign shipping companies for their services—an amount nearly equivalent to the country’s defence budget.While the government will provide financial aid to shipbuilders under the Rs 25,000-crore Shipbuilding Financial Assistance Scheme, the Rs 25,000-crore Maritime Development Fund will enable players to get long-term and low-cost financing.The third scheme — Shipbuilding Development Scheme (SDS), worth Rs 20,000 crore — will focus on providing capital assistance for greenfield shipbuilding mega clusters, through infrastructure support for common maritime facilities and land connectivity; capital aid to existing shipyards for capacity expansion; and establishment of an apex body for capability development.Sources said the programme has been finalised after drawing from the experience of major maritime nations such as China and South Korea, which have become top players in shipbuilding on account of govt-led financial support and cluster-based development. The schemes, having the potential to create nearly two crore direct and indirect jobs, are set to get Cabinet approval in the next two weeks.Officials said the SDS is crucial as it seeks to support the Indian shipbuilding industry in capacity and capability creation, and provide credit risk covers, something available in other countries. At present, only eight out of 61 shipyards in India are large or very large.On May 14, TOI had reported that the government has identified four land parcels of 2,000-3,000 acres each in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu for developing greenfield shipbuilding and repair hubs.","Prime minister narendra modi has announced three schemes to boost the shipbuilding sector.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s roadshow in Bhavnagar on Saturday was marked by two emotional moments that won hearts both on the streets and online.As his convoy moved through a sea of supporters showering flowers and raising slogans, a little boy stood respectfully and saluted the Prime Minister.

This collage highlights the bond between the Prime Minister and his mother. I want to thank him for accepting it.

NEW DELHI: UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday compared a shooter arrested in connection with the firing at actor Disha Patani’s Bareilly house to “Maareech”, a demon from Ramayan.Speaking at a function in Lok Bhawan, Adityanath said, “A criminal involved in crimes against women came from outside the state. He possibly entered like Maareech, but when the UP police’s bullet hit him, he admitted he entered wrongly and said he would never show such audacity again.” The CM added that this approach should be applied to every criminal who threatens women’s safety.Police said one of the five shooters involved in the Bareilly incident, Ramanivas, was arrested along with his associate Anil after an encounter on Friday.A video circulating on social media shows him lying on the ground with folded hands, saying, “Baba ke Uttar Pradesh mein kabhi nahi aayenge sir” (I will never come to Baba’s Uttar Pradesh again). He appeared to be referring to Adityanath.Senior superintendent of police Anurag Arya said Ramanivas sustained a bullet injury in his leg during the encounter.Police recovered a 32-bore pistol, four live cartridges, and four spent shells from the accused.During questioning, Ramanivas confessed to his role in the firing, police said.On 12 September, two men on a motorcycle reportedly fired nine shots at the Patani family’s house in the Civil Lines area in Bareilly. Disha's father Jagdish Patani, his wife Padma, and their children Khushboo and Suryansh were at home. Disha Patani was not present at the time.","Yogi adityanath compared a shooter arrested in connection with the firing at actor disha patani’s bareilly house to “maareech’, a demon from ramayan.

‘Don’t let Rambo die alone like Shankar’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-let-rambo-die-alone-like-shankar/articleshow/124017909.cms,"When 20-year-old Nikita Dhawan heard of Shankar’s death on Wednesday, it felt as if she had lost a close family member. For years, she had fought for the rescue of Delhi’s only African elephant, kept in solitary confinement at the city zoo. Now, she hopes Shankar’s passing will prevent a similar fate for Rambo, the only remaining African elephant in captivity at Mysuru Zoo.Dhawan first saw Shankar four years ago on a trip to Delhi Zoo with her parents, and felt something shift inside her. The elephant, one of two brought to India in 1998 as a diplomatic gift from Zimbabwe, stood alone, his feet bound with metallic chains. His companion had died in 2001, and since then, the elephant named after former Indian president Shankar Dayal Sharma lived in isolation — a cruel fate for a species known for their social nature and desire for companionship.“At that time, he was chained for 17 hours a day. He was also in the proximity of trains, which was very harmful to his ears. He was showing a lot of stressful behaviour,” she says.Dhawan, whose love for wildlife stemmed from the many trips she made with her parents to sanctuaries, decided to channel her heartbreak into action. She started a non-profit called Youth for Animals to mobilise support and help Shankar get out of the zoo.Soon, other young volunteers joined, filed RTIs and sent letters to the Delhi Zoo and the Prime Minister. They also gathered video evidence of his physical and mental state. In 2022, they officially filed a public interest litigation in Delhi high court. “An inspection report for Shankar was ordered, but it was not done by an independent third-party. So, we didn’t feel like the results accurately reflected his condition,” Dhawan says. It was decided that Shankar would be kept at the zoo. Then, in March 2023, the Supreme Court increased the jurisdiction and powers of a high-powered committee led by Justice (retd) Deepak Verma, to conduct necessary checks and fact-finding exercises concerning wild animals, including those in captivity, across India. That brought hope to Dhawan, and she focused on getting transfer options ready for Shankar. “We knew something had to be done urgently. Elephants are very social animals, and you can’t just rip them out of the wild and make them live on their own. For nearly 13 years, Shankar had no visual or oral communication, even with the other Asian elephants at the zoo,” says Dhawan.UK-based Aspinall Foundation, which runs multiple sanctuaries across Africa, agreed to shift the lonely elephant, and take care of the expenses too. However, the domestic authorities wanted to keep Shankar in India, Dhawan says. Hence, the search for a domestic alternative began. Last summer, she visited Vantara, the animal rescue arm of Reliance Foundation in Jamnagar, which expressed interest in housing Shankar alongside other African elephants. “We sent that option to the high-powered committee, but received no response,” she says.Meanwhile, pressure began to mount on the Delhi zoo authorities. In Oct 2024, the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums suspended its license over concerns about Shankar’s living conditions. The body asked the authorities to either improve the conditions or relocate him. However, before that could happen, Shankar passed away at the age of 29, years before the species’ average life expectancy of 70. An inquiry has been ordered into the cause of the death, while zoo officials claim that Shankar showed no signs of illness and the collapse was sudden. “I feel that the zoo had the option and the funding to make a better life for Shankar, but they chose not to take it. I do believe his death was preventable,” Dhawan emphasises.Currently studying at Stanford University, she hopes that the death will urge more Indian youngsters to speak up against the exploitation of animals for public entertainment. Her focus is now Rambo, the African elephant in Mysuru who has been alone since 2016 following the death of his father. “I really hope that Shankar’s death highlights the need to save Rambo before it’s too late.”","Shankar, delhi's only african elephant, died on wednesday at the age of 29.

"Congress cites CAG report on states’ debt, accuses centre of 'coercive federalism'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-cites-cag-report-on-states-debt-accuses-centre-of-coercive-federalism/articleshow/124018185.cms,"Randeep Surjewala (PTI file photo)

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over the appreciable jump in states’ debt highlighted by the CAG, Congress said the public debt of states has tripled in the last decade, rising from Rs 17.57 lakh crore in 2013 to Rs 59.60 lakh crore in 2022. The party said the states are victims of “coercive federalism” being followed by the Modi government which is not sharing revenues with them as desired, accusing the centre of playing “cess politics”.AICC spokesman and Rajya Sabha MP Randeep Surjewala said the public debt of states now amounts to 23% of the combined GSDP of 28 states, but the states are being stripped of their fiscal independence through the Modi government’s handling of the GST Compensation Cess and arbitrary central levies. He said this has resulted in “double jeopardy” for states of mounting debt and shrinking revenues.“Rs 1,70,000 crore is collected every year from ‘cesses and surcharges’, but the centre keeps it without sharing anything with states. ‘Compensation Cess’ was created to pay the states for GST losses, which ended in June 2022. Now, the same cess is only used to repay Central loans. Beyond Oct 2025, there is no constitutional mandate to continue with it, yet the Centre wants to hold it exclusively,” he said, demanding that the Centre share the cess with the states for the coming ten years.Surjewala said there appears to be a deliberate attempt to cripple the states and hollow out their functionality, to unionise power in the hands of the Centre. “This is ‘coercive federalism’ that seeks to convert the states into ‘glorified municipal committees’,” he added.The Congress MP warned that post rate cuts, GST collections will dip steeply in the future, with the shortfall likely to be Rs 40,000 crore as per the Centre and Rs 80,000 crore as per the SBI, while other estimates peg it at Rs 1.5-2.5 lakh crore. “The states will lose half or more of this, but neither GST nor Cess will flow to them,” he said.",The public debt of states has tripled in the last decade.

"Adoptions at decadal high in India, Maharashtra tops list accounting for 20% of total count",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/adoptions-at-decadal-high-in-india-maharashtra-tops-list-accounting-for-20-of-total-count/articleshow/124022746.cms,"PUNE: Maharashtra clinched the pole position in India with 849 inter-country and domestic adoptions in the last financial year - accounting for nearly 20% of the total count and a 38% surge from the state's previous fiscal's tally of 522.Across India, 4,515 children found families - the highest number in over a decade - while over 36,000 prospective adoptive parents (PAPs) are on the waiting list at present, hoping to adopt one of just 2,749 children legally available, according to data from Central Adoption Resource Authority (Cara). Of these, 1,808 are categorised as special-needs children.Of the 4,515 adoptions, 4,155 children found families within the country while 360 were international/inter-country adoptions. Maharashtra, where the domestic adoption count was 790, was followed by Tamil Nadu (438) and West Bengal (297). In international adoptions, Maharashtra led with a tally of 59, followed by Punjab (41) and Bengal (31).The average waiting time for PAPs is three-and-a-half years. Most PAPs seek girls and those aged 0-2 years, leaving older children and those with special needs under-placed. As many as 2,554 children adopted in FY 2024-25 were girls, accounting for 56% of all adoptions in India.""One reason is, more girls are given up than boys, making them available for adoption,"" said Vinita Bhargava, formerly with Cara as its founder member.A senior women and child development (WCD) dept official said, ""Some parents believe girls are more caring and affectionate, and are more likely to look after their parents in old age. Some feel girls adapt more easily to family life. Social awareness and single women often preferring to adopt girls are other reasons.""Many PAPs believe it is easier to build emotional connections with infants and younger children. The official said, ""For some, adopting younger children provides greater scope to shape their values, personality and upbringing. Others want to experience the entire parenting journey - from infancy to adulthood.""For older children, adoptions become trickier. ""Children above seven are harder to place, though many older children are legally free and waiting,"" said social worker Jayprakash Jadhav from Arun Ashray Charitable Trust, a specialised adoption agency registered with Cara. For children with special needs, challenges increase. According to a WCD ministry report, only 364 kids with special needs were reserved for adoption in 2024. The WCD official said, ""Adopting older children and those with special needs may involve challenges like attachment issues, behavioural concerns or certain medical requirements.""","Over 36,000 prospective adoptive parents (paps) are on the waiting list at present.

Meteor shower or sat debris? Fiery streak dazzles Delhi-NCR skyline,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/meteor-shower-or-sat-debris-fiery-streak-dazzles-delhi-ncr-skyline/articleshow/124022736.cms,"NEW DELHI: The skyline over Delhi and surrounding areas witnessed a mysterious streak of light, leaving residents in awe and sparking a wave of excitement on social media. Some stargazers took it as a meteor shower, while others speculated it to be part of debris of an old satellite falling on Earth. However, there is no official confirmation about it.The dazzling streak of light was visible across several cities, including Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon, and even in Aligarh. Videos of the lit-up skyline surfaced on social media platforms, showing a fiery trail shooting across the night sky before fragmenting into smaller pieces. Eyewitnesses reported the bright object over Delhi and Noida around 1.20 am on Saturday. When contacted by TOI, Isro remained silent on Saturday’s mysterious skyline event.Shresth Gautam, an influencer, shared a video and wrote, “Can you believe this happened last night over Delhi at 1:20 AM? It started as a usual Friday but ended unlike any other. I have never seen anything like it. Most probably it’s meteor debris, but no words can do justice to the view.”Another X user Ujjwal Yadav said, “Just witnessed this incredible fire streak in the night sky...Looks like a meteor or maybe part of a rocket burning up in the atmosphere-nature's own light show from my rooftop. Did anyone else spot it too?"" Yet another post from Gurgaon described it as a meteor shower: “Meteor Showers over Sector 77, Gurgaon at 1:25 AM. It was a bright streak of light... Extremely beautiful and fortunate to watch. ""A Grok comment on X suggested the lights were likely space debris from a Chinese CZ-3B rocket body reentering Earth's atmosphere. The claim was based on video analysis and predictions, pointing to the object's slower speed and visible fragmentation.Earlier, space experts had predicted that two newly-discovered comets would brighten the heavens in mid-October. A newly discovered comet, C/2025 R2 (SWAN) and another comet, C/2025 A6 (Lemmon), could become visible to naked eyes. The predictions said that stargazers may witness the rare sight of two comets and a meteor shower peaking together in the same week.However, there is no confirmation yet that Saturday’s mysterious skyline event was linked to these comets.","The dazzling streak of light was visible across several cities, including delhi, noida, ghaziabad, gurgaon, and even in aligarh.

Will talk to Reds if killings stop: Chhattisgarh deputy CM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-talk-to-reds-if-killings-stop-chhattisgarh-deputy-cm/articleshow/124021022.cms,"Chhattisgarh Deputy CM Vijay Sharma (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Chhattisgarh deputy CM Vijay Sharma on Saturday said govt was willing to positively consider the CPI(Maoist) offer to lay down arms and start peace negotiations, but the outfit must immediately stop civilian killings and remove IEDs it had planted across its areas of influence, reports Bharti Jain .“The CPI(Maoist) letter issued by its spokesperson Abhay was written on Aug 15 but issued a month later. But even after Aug 15, there have been killings of two shikshadoots (temporary, visiting teachers), on Aug 27 in Bijapur and on Aug 29 in Sukma. On Sept 2, two more civilians were killed by Maoists in Sukma,” he said.The CPI(Maoist) offer to suspend armed ‘struggle’ and the wanton killing of civilians and IED ambushes cannot go together. The leadership must first instruct its cadres on the ground to end civilian killings and de-mine the network of IEDs they have planted,” Chhattisgarh deputy CM Vijay Sharma told TOI .Inspector general, Bastar range, P Sunderraj added that it would take Maoists no more than a week to deactivate the IEDs — laid across ‘core areas’ in the Dandakaranya region and on Bihar-Jharkhand border —if such a directive was issued by the top leadership.The Chhattisgarh deputy CM said the final call on CPI(Maoist)’s peace offer will be taken by the top political leadership, comprising the prime minister and home minister, after careful consideration and due consultation with all the stakeholders.“We are ready to welcome Maoists with open arms if they choose to come forward, including starting with a video call, and lay down arms; we will ensure their rehabilitation and reintegration into the mainstream,” said the Chattisgarh deputy CM.For the time being, he underlined, there is no directive to the counterNaxal forces to scale down operations.As per intelligence reports, a secret meeting had purportedly taken place in Aug among a few top CPI (Maoist) leaders, including Mallojula Venugopal Rao, alias ‘Abhay’. Thippiri Tirupathi, alias Devji, the new general secretary after the neutralisation of Basavaraju in May, had attended the meeting, a source claimed. The discussions were focused on the crackdown by the forces in their old pocket boroughs and the way forward. “We are still evaluating if Devji is on the same page as Abhay on laying down arms, even though the Aug 15 statement was issued by the latter as the CPI(Maoist) spokesperson,” a senior intelligence officer said but added that even if a section of leadership favours peace talks, it should be followed through.The confusion within the CPI(Maoist) on the peace move has arisen thanks to a statement issued by its Telangana state committee on Friday, disagreeing with the unconditional peace offer of ‘Abhay’ alias Sonu and insisting that it was not “authorized” by the party.""Had Devji and Abhay, two of CPI(Maoist) seniormost leaders, been in agreement, the Telangana state committee would not have dared to issue such a statement,"" said an officer.The Telangana committee, in the statement dated Sept 19, opined that it was immature ""to say in public that there were no internal consultations on laying down arms, and asking for a month for the same"".""When a leader/cadre wants to give up the path of violence and join the mainstream, he discusses it within the party forum and gets approval. By not consulting the party formations, a state of confusion has arisen between the party and its military formations,” the Telangana committee noted and asked all extremist and political formations to disregard the unconditional peace offer made through Abhay. “The struggle against fascist BJP and its anti-people policies must be intensified,” it stated.",Chhattisgarh deputy cm vijay sharma said govt was willing to positively consider the cpi(maoist) offer to lay down arms and start peace negotiations.
