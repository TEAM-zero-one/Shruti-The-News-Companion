NEW DELHI: Four Kanwar pilgrims were killed and several others injured after being hit by a car late Tuesday night on the Sheetla Mata highway in Madhya Pradesh’s Gwalior district.Gwalior's chief superintendent of police Hina Khan said, ""We got information that an incident has happened on the Sheetla Mata highway in which some Kanwar pilgrims were hit by a speeding car...

""The family of the deceased said that there were thirteen people in total, out of which six people were injured and four died.

Was Justice Varma notice in Rajya Sabha just submitted or was it admitted?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/was-varma-notice-in-rajya-sabha-just-submitted-or-was-it-admitted/articleshow/122848328.cms,"High court judge Yashwant Varma (File Photo)

NEW DELHI: Was the notice for the motion of removal of Allahabad HC Justice Yashwant Varma only ""submitted"" or was it ""admitted"" as well. The seemingly technical issue goes to the heart of the fast-paced events that led to the resignation of Vice-President and Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar on Monday evening.It acquires significance because a determination would decide whether the RS Chairman would have a role in the choice of the three members of the investigation panel which, under the Constitution, would examine the veracity of the charges against Justice Varma.Dhankhar is learnt to have earned the annoyance of the govt and the governing coalition by acknowledging the notice given by 63 opposition MPs to seek the launch of proceedings for the HC judge's ouster. Sources termed it as a ""breach-of-faith"" issue by pointing out that the govt had already announced its decision that the process should start in Lok Sabha and had taken the first step by getting 145 MPs from all parties to sign the notice which was submitted to LS Speaker Om Birla on Monday morning.However, Dhankhar sidestepped this, and the RS notice had signatures of only opposition members. Although technically correct, the decision flew in the face of govt's desire to make the proceedings against Justice Varma an all-party concern.On Monday afternoon in RS, Dhankhar cited the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, to say that in a situation where such a notice is given in both Houses on the same day, ""no committee shall be constituted unless the motion has been admitted in both Houses and where such motion has been admitted in both Houses, the committee shall be constituted jointly by the speaker and the chairman"".The ex-chairman said that the motion signed by 63 members ""meets the numerical requirement of setting in motion a process for the removal of an HC judge"" - reference to the stipulation that the motion for removal, in case of RS, needed to be signed by at least 50 members. He stopped short of saying whether the motion has been admitted, but emphasised that the chairman or the speaker has no right to admit or reject if ""a motion is presented on the same day in both the Houses"".However, the 1968 Act doesn't mention such a provision. Dhankhar had directed the RS secretary general to take necessary steps.Sources, however, said the final call on the issue will now be that of the deputy chairperson, Harivansh, who started as the officiating chairman after President Droupadi Murmu accepted Dhankhar's resignation.""There is no certainty he would endorse what Dhankhar observed,"" said a source. ""In any case, he has no special interest in matters concerning judiciary and is unlikely to diverge drastically from the speaker in the choice of the members of the inquiry panel,"" the source further said.",Jagdeep dhankhar is learnt to have earned the annoyance of the govt and the governing coalition by acknowledging the notice given by 63 opposition mps to seek the launch of proceedings for the hc judge's ouster.

"Can SC fix timeline for President, governor nod to bills? Centre, states' view sought",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-sc-fix-timeline-for-president-governor-nod-to-bills-centre-states-view-sought/articleshow/122848194.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday swiftly entertained President Droupadi Murmu's reference questioning SC's power and jurisdiction to fix timelines for the President and governors in granting, declining or withholding assent to bills passed by assemblies while brushing aside 'maintainability' objections by Tamil Nadu and Kerala.A bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar issued notice to the Union and state govts on the presidential reference under Article 143(1) of the Constitution which seeks the SC's opinion on the correctness of the April 8 judgment of an SC bench led by Justice J B Pardiwala granting deemed assent to Tamil Nadu bills using the SC's exclusive powers under Art 142.The bench said it would post preliminary hearing on July 29 to fix a schedule for detailed hearing on issues raised by the President.Senior advocate K K Venugopal, for Kerala, and P Wilson raised the issue of maintainability of the reference. The bench said all questions raised in the reference were open for consideration. However, it said it would hear all parties on the issue of maintainability and asked Wilson not to raise it repeatedly.The bench said attorney general R Venkataramani would assist the court while solicitor general Tushar Mehta would represent the Union govt.On the opposite side were senior advocates Kapil Sibal, A M Singhvi, Gopal Subramanium and Rakesh Dwivedi.TOI was the first to report on May 15 about the President sending a reference to the SC for its opinion on the contentious issue of judiciary stepping into the domain of the executive, especially when the Constitution gave no power to the SC to grant deemed assent on behalf of the governor to bills.The reference had said Articles 200 and 201, applicable to governors and the President respectively, “does not stipulate any timeframe or procedure” to be followed by them while considering grant or refusal of assent to a bill passed by an assembly. “The exercise of constitutional discretion by the governor and the President under Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution, respectively, are essentially governed by polycentric considerations, including federalism, uniformity of laws, integrity and security of the nation, doctrine of separation of powers,” the reference had said. Article 200 mandates the governor, on presentation of a bill passed by an assembly, to grant assent or ‘as soon as possible’ return the bill, excluding money bills, for reconsideration by the House. And when the reconsidered bill is presented to the governor, he “shall not withhold assent”, the provision says.However, when a governor reserves a bill for consideration of the President, she under Article 201 is mandated to declare whether she assents to the bill or withholds it. If she directs the governor to return the bill for reconsideration of the House, then upon reconsideration within six months, it “shall be presented again to the President for assent”. It does not fix any timeline for the President.Critical of the SC using its Article 142 powers to rule that the 10 bills pending with the TN governor were deemed to have been assented to, the President had said, “The concept of a deemed assent of the President and the governor is alien to the constitutional scheme and fundamentally circumscribes the powers of the President and the governor.”","President droupadi murmu questioned sc's power and jurisdiction to fix timelines for the president and governors in granting, declining or withholding assent to bills passed by assemblies.

NEW DELHI: Two men suspected of involvement in the killing of gangster Chandan Mishra inside a Patna hospital were injured in a police encounter on Tuesday, officials said.The incident took place during a joint operation conducted by the Bihar Special Task Force (STF) and Bhojpur district police.The miscreants have been identified as Balwant Kumar Singh and Ravi Ranjan Kumar Singh and were taken to hospital for treatment.Police seized two pistols and one magazine.Mishra, who was out on parole for a liver surgery, was shot multiple times by a group of men who entered the hospital posing as visitors.CCTV footage later helped police identify some of the suspects.The latest encounter took place during a combing operation following the arrest of five men from a guest house in Kolkata’s Anandapur area on July 17.The Kolkata operation was jointly carried out by Bihar’s Special Investigation Team (SIT) and Bengal’s Special Task Force (STF).Another five men had earlier been detained from a housing complex in Kolkata’s New Town area for allegedly aiding the suspects.Police say the gang, led by Tauseef Badshah, had been on the run across state borders. They changed SIM cards to evade surveillance but were eventually traced using IMEI data.A white sedan used in their getaway from Patna was also seized.According to sources, the group initially sought refuge in New Town but were turned away. They later moved to a guest house in Anandapur, where they were apprehended.Meanwhile, five Bihar policemen posted at Patna’s Shastri Nagar police station — under whose jurisdiction the hospital falls — have been suspended for negligence in connection with the incident.Police say all ten suspects are currently being interrogated as the investigation into the high-profile killing continues.",Gangster chandan mishra was shot multiple times by a group of men who entered the hospital posing as visitors.

JAIPUR: The brutal murder of a 22-year-old man in Paldi Meena suburb, around 10 km from Jaipur, escalated into widespread protests and unrest, disrupting traffic movement for hours on Jaipur-Agra national highway Monday.The victim, Vipin Kumar, was stabbed around 14 times, allegedly by Mohammad Anas and his associates, late Sunday night in full public view, police said.The protest was finally withdrawn Monday evening after the family's demands for financial compensation, job guarantee and speedy justice were accepted by the administration.Anas, described by police as a ""history-sheeter"" with over a dozen criminal cases against him in Jaipur Commissionerate's Jamdoli police station, allegedly posted on social media claiming ""revenge"" after the attack.The murder sparked outrage, with large crowds gathering Monday morning to protest the killing. Demonstrators attempted multiple road blockades on the national highway, while some protesters targeted and damaged shops allegedly belonging to members of a particular community.Police took swift action and detained accused Mohammad Anas and his five accomplices in the afternoon. During the arrest, Anas allegedly attempted to seize an ASI's service pistol, forcing the police to shoot him in the leg.He was subsequently taken to a hospital for treatment under police custody.DCP (East) Tejaswani Gautam said the motive behind the murder remains under investigation. However, local sources pointed to an ongoing dispute between the victim and the accused spanning two years, despite previous attempts at mediation.Enraged residents claimed Anas had previously threatened multiple families in the area, including Kumar's. ""Anas had been arrested before. Police even paraded him in public, but he only grew bolder,"" said Sunil Khatik, a local resident.The victim's family demanded compensation, including employment guarantee and financial assistance, as they refused to proceed with the postmortem until their demands were met.As family members and locals demanded immediate justice, unrest spread, leading to repeated attempts at blocking traffic on the national highway. Police efforts to control the situation resulted in sporadic clashes, with some demonstrators damaging nearby shops before being pushed back.By the evening, while the size of the agitating crowd diminished, the local community remained insistent on compensation, including a job and financial support for Kumar's family, and the execution of the accused.A large police force, including Rapid Action Force (RAF) and Quick Response Teams (QRT), was deployed throughout the area.The roots of the conflict reportedly trace back two years to an incident involving a goat belonging to Kumar’s family.One sister recalled that the tension began two years ago, when Kumar’s goat strayed into Anas’s lane. Friends of Kumar said a possible dispute over a girl may have played a role. Police said this claim surfaced during early questioning but was unconfirmed.","Vipin kumar, 22, was stabbed 14 times in paldi meena suburb, jaipur.

""A 15-year-old girl, allegedly set on fire by three masked men in Odisha’s Puri district, was transferred to AIIMS New Delhi, where she remains in stable condition with 70-75%burn injuries.The class 9 dropout was walking to a relative’s home around 8.30am Saturday when she was reportedly intercepted near a river embankment, rendered unconscious by a chemical-lacedcloth, and doused with kerosene before being set ablaze.Screaming for help, she fled to a nearby house, where Dukshishyam Senapati extinguished the flames and gave her fresh clothes.Recalling the harrowing moment, Senapati said that when he answered his door, he was stunned to find the girl engulfed in flames and crying in agony, as he later explained to DGP YB Khurania during the official's site visit.""It was around 8.30 am when the girl came to my house, screaming. With the help of my wife, I doused the fire and gave her water as she was very thirsty.Later, the women of my family changed her clothes,"" he said.Upon questioning, the girl informed Senapati that three unidentified men had set her ablaze. She explained being abducted by motorcycle-riding assailants whilst returning from meeting a friend.""She said she was walking back home after meeting a friend when she was picked up by three men who arrived on motorcycles. The faces of these men were half-covered, and they took her to a place near the Bhargavi riverbank. She could not tell their names. She could only say that they covered her face with a handkerchief and poured some substance before setting her on fire,"" he said.Senapati noticed that although the girl mentioned being bound during the abduction, her hands were free when she arrived. After learning her father's details, he contacted her family. The large crowd that gathered prevented further conversation with the victim.Despite searching the area, Senapati couldn't locate the perpetrators. He explained that the attackers fled after setting her alight, presumably expecting her to perish. However, the girl managed to escape and reach his house.Due to delayed ambulance response, they resorted to an auto rickshaw for hospital transport. The girl remained at his residence for approximately 90 minutes.The incident has created fear in the village, particularly among children who are now afraid to venture out alone.

""Sharad Pawar is a large-hearted and senior leader. His comments are priceless for me,"" he added.Last week, Thackeray and Fadnavis held a meeting for over 20 minutes at the office of Legislative Council Chairman Ram Shinde.The meeting was held a day after Fadnavis said that Thackeray ""can come to the ruling side in a different way.""""At least till 2029, there is no scope for us to come there (opposition).

With support from Eknath Shinde, who split the Shiv Sena, the MVA government collapsed, and the BJP returned to power in alliance with the Shinde-led Sena faction. Fadnavis took the deputy chief minister’s post, while Shinde assumed the chief ministership. Although the alliance secured a sweeping mandate in the 2024 elections, Shinde, who had been chief minister since the coup, appeared hesitant to relinquish the top post to Fadnavis.Moreover, speculation over a possible alliance between Uddhav Thackeray’s Shiv Sena (UBT) and Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) has grown since the two leaders appeared together on July 5, their first joint appearance in 20 years.

The 'Durga Angan' gambit



BJP slams TMC’s Hindu symbolism



TMC defends its faith credentials



Why temple projects matter for TMC



NEW DELHI: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who is often accused of appeasement politics by her opponents, seems to be charting new waters to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as the political temperatures rise ahead of the 2026 West Bengal assembly election.In the recent bypoll in Nadia's Kaliganj assembly segment, BJP, which although lost the election, felt that the party had significant takeaway from the results - consolidation of Hindu votes.""We have been able to reap the benefits of assimilating Hindu votes in the region. The effort has paid off since we have received an overwhelming majority of votes from Hindu-dominated areas like Palassey,"" Suvendu Adhikari, leader of opposition, said.This perhaps explains Mamata's recent visible tilt towards soft Hindutva as she tries to do a course correction. With the grand inauguration of Rs 250 crore Jagannath Dham in April, and now the announcement of 'Durga Angan' project, Mamata is signaling a deliberate recalibration of her ideological narrative, long dominated by BJP.With the 2026 West Bengal assembly elections looming, the chief minister has moved to the heart of the state's cultural and religious identity with her announcement to create 'Durga Angan', a grand year-round temple complex dedicated to Ma Durga.""Just as we developed Jagannath Dham, we will create 'Durga Angan' so that people can visit and experience it throughout the year,"" the TMC chief said.Interestingly, the announcement comes at a time when BJP is swiftly invoking Bengal centric religious symbols like 'Jai Ma Kali' and 'Jai Ma Durga' in its campaign narrative.On July 18, Prime Minister Narendra Modi invoked the Goddesses at the beginning of his speech in Durgapur as he said that BJP is the only party that truly respects and protects Bengali 'ashmita' (pride).Later Banerjee, targeting PM directly during Martyrs’ Day rally asked: ""Why is it that you suddenly start remembering Ma Kali and Ma Durga only during the elections? Ma Durga is our revered goddess, and Durga Puja has even received international recognition as an Intangible Cultural Heritage. Now listen, just as we developed Jagannath Dham, we will create ‘Durga Angan’ so that people can visit and experience it throughout the year. ""The CM, however, gave no timeline or details of the project.Soon after Mamata's announcement, BJP slammed the decision as unconstitutional, alleging misuse of public funds to promote religion and branding it a political ploy to woo Hindu votes traditionally gravitating toward BJP.Suvendu Adhikari, leader of the opposition in the West Bengal assembly, asked, ""No religious institution - temple, mosque, church or gurudwara - can be built using taxpayers' money."" He accused Mamata of misusing public funds and ignoring constitutional benchmarks.He further added, ""She hasn't read the Constitution, nor does she understand her own religion. She must educate herself before making such statements.""TMC spokesperson Riju Dutta, in rebuttal, pointed out Mamata Banerjee's long-standing spiritual affinity and said, ""She performed Kali Puja at home even before entering politics. Building temples like Jagannath Dham or Durga Angan stems from genuine faith."" He also cited prior state support for thousands of grassroots Durga Pujas and securing a Unesco heritage tag for the festival as evidence of the TMC’s longstanding cultural engagement.""She has supported thousands of grassroots Durga Pujas with financial grants and helped secure UNESCO's heritage tag for the festival. She even organises the annual Durga Puja Carnival. Does that not count? BJP mocks Jagannath Dham as a 'theme park' and now questions her faith, people will judge them,"" he added.In West Bengal, the BJP election campaigns have focused on alleged Muslim appeasement by TMC, drawing support from Hindu voters. This has been especially effective in districts such as Murshidabad, Malda, Nadia, and North 24 Parganas.As Mamata government fights the aftermath of recent riots in Murshidabad, rapes in Kolkata medical college and B-school, the temple projects help TMC's double strategy of blending soft Hindutva symbolism with welfare-centric politics.These moves also come at a time when BJP has brought in Samik Bhattacharya, a staunch party loyalist with deep RSS roots to lead BJP state unit president marking a strategic move by the central leadership to stabilise the state unit amid internal rifts and prepare it for the 2026 Assembly elections.Since the BJP's 2021 assembly poll defeat, the organisation has suffered desertions, infighting, and setbacks in the 2023 Panchayat polls, 2024 Lok Sabha elections and recent bypoll in Kaliganj.In the 2021 assembly elections, TMC secured 48.02% vote share and 215 out of 292 seats, while BJP captured 37.97% but only 77 seats.In the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, TMC won 29 of 42 seats with approximately 45.76% vote share, up from around 43.3% in 2019; BJP fell to 12 seats with 38.73%, from 40.7% in 2019.While TMC retains advantage, Mamata's recent turn toward Hindu imagery appears bipartisan in purpose: a fence-mending strategy with Hindu voters while reinforcing her base among minority groups and welfare beneficiaries.As Banerjee positions herself at the cross-section of symbolism and state resources, her gamble may well be to preempt BJP's Hindutva allure. For now, the electoral arithmetic still favors TMC, but the game is tightening.In Bengal’s increasingly polarised politics, religious symbolism is now a shared battlefield, and Mamata is choosing to play offense.","Mamata banerjee is charting new waters to take on the bharatiya janata party (bjp) the announcement of 'durga angan' project is signaling a deliberate recalibration of her ideological narrative, long dominated by bjp.

Resignation row: CM Mamata Banerjee casts doubt on VP Jagdeep Dhankhar’s health reason for departure; says ‘he’s a healthy man’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/resignation-row-cm-mamata-banerjee-casts-doubt-on-vp-jagdeep-dhankhars-health-reason-for-departure-says-hes-a-healthy-man/articleshow/122838874.cms,"CM Mamata Banerjee casts doubt on VP Jagdeep Dhankhar’s health reason for departure (Picture credit: PTI)

NEW DELHI: West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee expressed scepticism over vice president Jagdeep Dhankhar's resignation on medical grounds, calling him ""a healthy man"" and suggesting there might be more to the story.When asked by reporters in Howrah about his sudden exit, Banerjee said, ""I don't want to make any comment about this. Let's see what happens. He is a healthy man. I think his health is absolutely okay"".Dhankhar stepped down on the very first day of the Monsoon session of Parliament, with his resignation immediately accepted by President Droupadi Murmu.Prime Minister Narendra Modi later posted on X, wishing him well and acknowledging his years of public service, saying, ""Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar Ji has got many opportunities to serve our country in various capacities, including as the Vice President of India.""However, his abrupt departure with over two years left in his term has triggered a wave of political speculation.Congress MP Jairam Ramesh pointed to ""far deeper reasons"" behind the move, citing a possible incident between 1 PM and 4.30 PM on Monday. He detailed how Dhankhar chaired a Business Advisory Committee (BAC) meeting at 12.30 PM and rescheduled it for 4.30 PM, only for senior BJP leaders JP Nadda and Kiren Rijiju to skip it without directly informing him, something Ramesh claimed might have upset the Vice President.The BJP, however, dismissed these suspicions. Nadda clarified that both he and Rijiju had informed Dhankhar’s office in advance about their absence from the second BAC meeting.Adding more intrigue was Dhankhar’s last official act, he allowed the submission of a motion to remove Justice Yashwant Varma of the Allahabad High Court, just before stepping down.Dhankhar had been critical of the judiciary in the past, especially the Supreme Court's use of Article 142 and the collegium system.There are also murmurs of a larger political manoeuvre. Bihar's RJD alleged that the resignation might be part of a BJP strategy to move Nitish Kumar to a “ceremonial” role as Vice President, ahead of the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections . NDA leaders have dismissed this theory, but Dhankhar's resignation continues to stir debate across political circles and states.As per the Constitution, there is no fixed deadline for filling the Vice-President’s post. The Election Commission will decide the schedule, which will be conducted under the 1952 Act governing Presidential and Vice-Presidential elections.","Mamata banerjee casts doubt on vp jagdeep dhankhar’s health reason for departure.

NEW DELHI: Jagdeep Dhankhar's sudden resignation from the post of Vice President has triggered an unexpected wave of admiration from opposition MPs, many of whom had previously clashed with him over alleged partisanship.Several leaders who once accused Dhankhar of bias or filed a no-confidence motion against him are now urging him to reconsider his decision, hailing him as a ""kisanputra"" (son of a farmer) deserving of a dignified farewell.Among them is Congress president and leader of the opposition in Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge , who had often accused Dhankhar of not allowing him to speak in the House. Kharge repeatedly claimed that the Chair violated tradition by denying him the floor during crucial debates.Congress chief whip Jairam Ramesh, who once said Dhankhar behaved like a ""cheerleader for the government"" instead of a neutral umpire, had been the subject of a pending privilege notice for alleged disrespect to the Chair. Ramesh had also led the opposition’s no-confidence motion against Dhankhar, accusing him of conducting House proceedings in a ""highly partisan"" manner.Also Read: 'Kisanputra denied farewell': Congress questions Dhankhar's abrupt resignation, slams PM Modi's 'non-post' However, post-resignation, Ramesh took a markedly different tone.In a post on X, he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should persuade Dhankhar to withdraw his resignation, calling it “in the nation’s interest.”""The kisanputra is being denied even a dignified farewell,"" Ramesh wrote, describing Dhankhar’s resignation as ""totally unexpected"" and speculating whether his active role in processing two impeachment motions a day earlier had played a part. “He was his good jolly self while presiding yesterday,” Ramesh added, calling the move mysterious.He also claimed the resignation reflected more on those who elevated Dhankhar to the Vice President’s role than on the man himself.Kapil Sibal, another senior lawyer and former Union minister, had earlier been publicly rebuked by Dhankhar over his comments on a rape and murder case in Kolkata and for not attending House proceedings regularly. Despite those clashes, Sibal praised Dhankhar after his resignation, calling him “nationalist and patriotic,” and said he bore no ill will. “He used to speak his mind and never held grudges,” Sibal remarked.Derek O’Brien of the Trinamool Congress, who had numerous confrontations with Dhankhar, was once told in the House, ""Your conduct is ugliest. I will show you the door next time."" He was also accused of indulging in theatrics during debates and was suspended during the Winter Session of 2023 for “misconduct.”Other TMC leaders—Sagarika Ghosh, Saket Gokhale, and Kalyan Banerjee—had even mimicked Dhankhar during a protest, leading to further reprimands from the Chair.AAP MPs Raghav Chadha and Sanjay Singh, both suspended from the House during Dhankhar’s tenure, also had repeated clashes with him. Dhankhar’s sessions with actor-politician Jaya Bachchan too were contentious—Bachchan once demanded an apology for what she called ""disrespect towards women MPs.""Senior Congress lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi also drew Dhankhar’s ire after a bundle of ₹500 notes was found near his seat, leading to sharp words from the Chair.Despite all this, the tone across opposition ranks has shifted dramatically in the wake of Dhankhar’s resignation, with several leaders now suggesting his departure leaves a gap in parliamentary functioning—and expressing concern that his exit may not be as voluntary as it seems.","Jagdeep dhankhar's sudden resignation from the post of vice president has triggered an unexpected wave of admiration from opposition mps.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra agriculture minister Manikrao Kokate who was allegedly caught playing rummy on his mobile phone during the monsoon session of the state legislature landed into another controversy Tuesday after referring to the government as a ""beggar"" while trying to explain a previous statement about farmers.Earlier this year, Kokate faced backlash for allegedly comparing farmers to beggars.""Even a beggar does not take Re 1 in alms, but here we are giving crop insurance for Re 1. Even then, some people try to misuse it,"" he had said, as reported by PTI.On Tuesday, while clarifying this statement, he told reporters, ""The government doesn't give Re 1 to farmers, it takes Re 1 from them. The government is a beggar.""Kokate, who represents the Sinnar constituency in Nashik district, claimed that 5 lakh to 5.3 lakh bogus applications under the now-scrapped Re 1 crop insurance scheme were rejected, and corrective steps were taken. The scheme has since been replaced with the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme.Reacting to the minister’s latest remarks, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said as quoted by PTI, ""If he has made such a comment, it is inappropriate for ministers to speak in this manner. We have taken corrective measures in the crop insurance scheme as we saw insurance companies benefitting and not farmers.""""We have taken steps to make an investment of Rs 5,000 crore every year in the agriculture sector.Maharashtra's economy is good despite challenges,"" he added. NCP (SP) MP Supriya Sule also criticised Kokate's comments, calling them insensitive. ""It is an insult to the hard work of all the chief ministers of the state so far and the people of the state. We will never tolerate this insult,"" she said in a post on X.Last week, NCP (SP) MLA Rohit Pawar shared a video that appeared to show minister Kokate playing Rummy on his phone during the monsoon session of the Maharashtra legislature. The following day, Jitendra Awhad also posted two more videos, claiming Kokate was playing ‘Junglee Rummy’ during the proceedings.Dismissing the allegations, Kokate told PTI, ""I don't know how to play online rummy. One needs an OTP, and a bank account needs to be linked to play the game. One can check if my mobile phone is linked to any such game. I was trying to skip a game which popped up on my screen for 10 to 15 seconds,"" He also threatened legal action against opposition leaders for allegedly defaming him by circulating the video.When asked about the mounting calls for his resignation, Kokate pushed back strongly, saying, ""Tell me what has happened for which the resignation has been demanded. Have I molested someone? Have I stolen something or decided against farmers? Do I have a criminal background?""Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis also voiced disapproval over the video, prompting a response from Kokate, who said, as cited by PTI, ""The CM's reaction is based on media reports. It's true I didn't brief him"".Kokate maintained he has followed legislative rules for the past 25 years, but legal trouble continues to mount. A magistrate court in Nashik district recently convicted Kokate and his brother Sunil Kokate for submitting fake documents to secure flats under a government quota. They were sentenced to two years of imprisonment.Their conviction was stayed by the district court on March 5.","Mahar maharashtra agriculture minister manikrao kokate was allegedly caught playing rummy on his mobile phone during the monsoon session of the state legislature.

NEW DELHI: Union minister and BJP chief JP Nadda responed to the opposition’s claims that the absence of senior ministers from a key Rajya Sabha meeting was linked to Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar’s sudden resignation.Speaking to reporters in Parliament on Tuesday, Nadda confirmed that both he and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju had informed the Vice President's office that they would not be attending the 4:30 pm Business Advisory Committee (BAC) meeting chaired by Dhankhar.“The Vice President’s office was intimated about our inability to attend the meeting,” Nadda said, responding to allegations by Congress MP Jairam Ramesh, PTI reported.Ramesh had claimed that Dhankhar “took umbrage” at their absence and rescheduled the BAC meeting for Tuesday, shortly before he stepped down from the Vice President's post citing health reasons.Congress leaders suggested there may have been deeper reasons behind Dhankhar’s sudden decision. Ramesh, in a post on X, said both Nadda and Rijiju had attended a 12.30pm BAC meeting on Monday, but were “deliberately” absent from the second session at 4:30 pm.""The sudden resignation of the Vice President and Chairman of the Rajya Sabha is as shocking as it is inexplicable.

Poll Do you believe businesses should display owner information publicly? Yes, it's necessary for transparency. No, it invades privacy

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed dhaba and restaurant owners along the Kanwar Yatra route to comply with the Uttar Pradesh government’s mandate requiring the display of licence and registration information.“At this stage, all the respective hotel owners shall comply with the mandate of license and registration certificate as required statutorily. We make it clear that we’re not going into the issues being argued. The application stands closed”, the top court stated in its order, as quoted by ANI.Earlier this year, the Uttar Pradesh government issued an order requiring eateries to display QR codes containing information about their owners. Shortly afterward, the Uttarakhand government issued a similar directive.Last week, the apex court had issued notices to the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.The petition, filed by academic Apoorvanand Jha and others, argues that such requirements violate citizens’ fundamental rights and could lead to discriminatory profiling.“The new measures mandate the display of QR codes on all eateries along the Kanwar route, which reveal the names and identities of the owners, thereby achieving the same discriminatory profiling that was previously stayed by this court,” said Jha, citing a June 25 UP government press release.""Vague and overbroad directives deliberately mix up the licensing requirements with the other unlawful demand to display religious identity, and leave scope for violent enforcement of such a manifestly arbitrary demand both by vigilante groups and by authorities on the ground. There is grave and imminent risk of irreparable injury to the fundamental rights of affected vendors, particularly from minority communities, unless this Court issues immediate directions to restrain Respondents from continuing this indirect implementation,"" it added.The plea urged the Court to restrict such mandates to standard licensing norms and eliminate vague directives requiring identity disclosures.Last year, the top court had restrained the UP and Uttarakhand governments from enforcing directives that required shop owners and hawkers along the Kanwar Yatra routes to display their names and those of their staff at their establishments.The Court held that food sellers were only obligated to indicate the type of food they were offering. In its 22 July order, the Court said: ""We deem it appropriate to pass interim order prohibiting the enforcement of the impugned directives. In other words, the food sellers (including dhaba owners, restaurants, foods and vegetable sellers, hawkers, etc) may be required to display the kind of food that they are serving to the kanwariyas. But they must not be forced to display the name/identity of the owners and the employees deployed in their respective establishments.""","The supreme court on tuesday directed dhaba and restaurant owners along the kanwar yatra route to comply with the uttar pradesh government’s mandate.

Dhankhar's move to examine oppn's notice raised suspicions

NEW DELHI: ""Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar ji has had many opportunities to serve our country in various capacities, including as Vice-President of India. Wishing him good health,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted on X, shortly after President Droupadi Murmu accepted Dhankhar's resignation.Going by sendoff messages for politicians, the post was starkly terse and conveyed the tension that resulted in Dhankhar's abrupt resignation as vice-president on Monday evening. Political circles were quick to note that the PM had refrained from commenting on the outgoing VP's functioning as chairman of the Rajya Sabha: something that was taken as confirmation that Dhankhar's decision on Monday to admit the opposition's notice for the motion of removal of Allahabad HC's Justice Yashwant Varma, despite having known the govt's decision to start the process in the Lok Sabha (which TOI had reported on Tuesday, had not gone down well).The contrast from the effusive praise for Dhankhar three years ago, when the Modi govt elevated him to the second highest constitutional position, was glaring and fully captured the radical change in equations since he was plucked from near-obscurity to be appointed governor of West Bengal in 2019, a big ""opportunity"" that had come his way courtesy the current central dispensation.If brevity was the PM's chosen weapon to convey the disappointment, his senior cabinet colleagues said it all through sheer silence on their X handles.NDA partners were also equally conspicuous by their reticence, the sole exception being the Andhra ally, Jana Sena leader Pawan Kalyan.The 'cancellation' was a measure of the annoyance Dhankhar managed to generate by his moves through Monday, starting with his unusual generosity towards LOP Mallikarjun Kharge.The then Chairman, whom the opposition had relentlessly targeted for being partisan, chose to let Kharge speak ahead of the leader of the House and health minister J P Nadda, although by convention, the latter should have been given precedence.That Kharge launched a sharp attack on govt and the PM over the Pahalgam terror attack and US President Donald Trump's unsubstantiated claim of having forced India and Pakistan to halt Operation Sindoor only added to the irritation that had begun to build up on treasury benches and which found expression in Nadda's uncharacteristic ""only what I say is going to be on record"" assertion to protesting opposition members.But it took the second 'provocation' of the day - Dhankhar's announcement post-lunch about having received a notice from 63 members in support of a motion for the removal of Justice Varma, and his directive to examine where it would stand vis-a-vis a similar move made by 153 members in the Lok Sabha earlier in the day - that turned the smouldering annoyance into anger and, crucially, sparked suspicion about his intent.All signatories to the RS notice were, in contrast to the all-party complexion of what had earlier been submitted in Lok Sabha, from the opposition - something which militated against govt's known desire for a ""consensus"" backing for action against Justice Varma's alleged corruption and could not have escaped Dhankhar's attention. Dhankhar's indulgence of the opposition would have ensured him a say in the choice of the three-member panel that is required to go into the charges of corruption against the judge.Already upset with him over the barbs he would routinely train at the judiciary, as well as the perception that they were officially sponsored, govt did not take kindly at the meddling.Similar activism from Dhankhar had earlier led Supreme Court to drop its inquiry against Allahabad high court Justice Shekhar Yadav in a case of alleged hate speech and fling the ball back into the Rajya Sabha's court.What followed was a flurry of moves. Amid deepening suspicions about the intent and buzz of a ""secret deal"", BJP managers scrambled to get the NDA contingent to sign off on a similar notice. Such was the hurry that many RS members trooping into the chamber of defence minister Rajnath Singh did not even get to see the text of the notice as they put their signatures on the paper put up before them.Simultaneously, both Nadda and parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju decided to skip the business advisory committee meeting Dhankhar had convened in the evening, leaving it for minister of state L Murugan and BJP's chief whip K Laxman to represent the governing side.The message for Dhankhar was clear and he lost little time in heeding it. Just hours later, he rushed to the Rashtrapati Bhavan to submit his resignation on ""health"" grounds.The dominant estimate in political circles is that he is not going to quietly fade away. Many feel the Supreme Court lawyer, who started off with Janata Dal and did a stint with Congress before landing in BJP, may launch himself in a different version: as a farm leader.There was also a sudden outbreak of ""sympathy"" for him in opposition quarters, with even Congress and Trinamool Congress, his chief tormentors, seeking to portray him as a victim.But he appeared to be receding from the proceedings he would lord over when presiding officer Ghanshyam Tiwari announced that his resignation had been accepted.","Jagdeep dhankhar ji has had many opportunities to serve our country in various capacities, including as vice-president of india.
