Calcutta HC: State can now lodge fresh FIRs against Suvendu Adhikari without court nod,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/calcutta-hc-state-can-now-lodge-fresh-firs-against-suvendu-adhikari-without-court-nod/articleshow/124798298.cms,"Suvendu Adhikari

KOLKATA: Calcutta high court (HC) on Friday revoked interim protection against ""coercive steps"" by Bengal authorities that assembly opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari had since Dec 2022. Justice Jay Sengupta, while passing the order, held that ""any interim order by way of protection cannot continue for an unlimited period"". State administration can now lodge fresh FIRs against Adhikari without HC's nod.Justice Sengupta ordered the setting up of an SIT comprising seniors from CBI and state police to investigate several cases based on FIRs lodged against Adhikari. But the single-judge bench dismissed 15 other pending cases. The cases under investigation include an alleged job scam case registered in Kolkata; another was initiated following Adhikari's alleged threat to Tamluk cops.Another single-judge bench of Justice Rajasekhar Mantha had restrained the state in Dec 2022 from taking any ""coercive measures"" against Adhikari in 29 cases. Justice Mantha had also directed the state not to lodge any criminal case against Adhikari without the court's permission.A division bench of Justices IP Mukerji and Biswaroop Chowdhury had later observed that Article 361 of the Constitution provided blanket protective covers only to the President and state governors. But they told cops to seek the court's permission before taking any ""coercive steps"" against Adhikari and directed the state director-general of police to submit reports on FIRs lodged against Adhikari.The state then moved SC against Justice Mantha's order providing a ""blanket stay"" on FIRs against Adhikari. It, in turn, referred all pending cases against Adhikari to HC for final adjudication with directions to dispose of them expeditiously. Justice Mantha released all cases against Adhikari from his court following SC order.","Calcutta high court revokes interim protection against ""coercive steps"" by bengal authorities.

Mom-in-law cannot be ousted for child to stay with dad: Bombay HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mom-in-law-cannot-be-ousted-for-child-to-stay-with-dad-hc/articleshow/124798265.cms,"The vacation court was hearing the mother's challenge to the Oct 13 order of family court granting the child's interim custody to his father from Oct 17 till Oct 23. Pending divorce proceedings, the estranged couple signed consent terms by which the father was given access for 2 hours every Saturday in the family court's child complex. The wife's advocate said there are some concerns this time, and therefore, she is not comfortable granting the father access to the child for such an extended period, especially overnight, adding that the condition that the mother-in-law should not be at home is reasonable and in the child's interest. The child is not willing to be with the father, and family court did not consider the child's wish, he added.The child's father said the condition is most unreasonable, and he cannot keep his mother outside the house during the child's stay with him. He said his wife knew this arrangement would never work, which is why she suggested such an unreasonable condition. He informed the court that he was not given access to the child and lost five days of access.Justice Jamsandekar noted that the family court, on the father's application for access to his son, ""considered all the facts and circumstances."" He said the record of the petition and family court order did not support the wife's submissions.

Pay service benefits to wife of missing govt employee: Chhattisgarh HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pay-service-benefits-to-wife-of-missing-govt-employee-chhattisgarh-hc/articleshow/124798218.cms,"Chhattisgarh HC

Raipur: Dependent wife of a missing govt employee can challenge his ex parte termination and claim service benefits of the employee who has been presumed dead after law-mandated absence of seven years, Chhattisgarh high court ruled earlier this week.With this, the court dismissed a writ petition filed by Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) and Bhilai Steel Plant (BSP), upholding an order mandating the company to provide all consequential service benefits to family of the missing employee.A division bench comprising Justice Sanjay K Agrawal and Justice Radhakishan Agrawal directed BSP to expeditiously finalise the service benefits for the woman. The bench rejected SAIL's challenge against the order of Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), Bilaspur bench, which had set aside the employee's removal from service.The employee, a senior technician at BSP's Rajhara mines, went missing on Jan 14, 2010. His wife had lodged an FIR regarding his disappearance. Despite receiving an official intimation about his missing status, BSP proceeded to issue a charge sheet against the absent employee on Dec 11, 2010, and subsequently removed him from service through an ex parte order dated Sept 17, 2011.CAT allowed the woman's application, setting aside the removal order and directing BSP to grant all consequential benefits.SAIL/BSP challenged this order in HC, arguing that the woman lacked locus standi to file the plea without a civil court declaration presuming her husband's death.The HC bench, however, held that since the employee had not been heard from for more than seven years, presumption of death under Section 108 of Indian Evidence Act, 1872, applied. The court noted that a civil court declaration under Specific Relief Act, 1963, was unnecessary when the fact of the seven-year absence was undisputed. HC said BSP committed a legal error by terminating the employee's service despite being aware of his missing status.",Chhattisgarh hc rules that wife of missing govt employee can challenge his ex parte termination and claim service benefits.

West Bengal Police Arrest Three in Connection with Durgapur Gang-Rape Case





BENGALURU: Bengaluru Rural police have arrested three youths in connection with the alleged gang-rape of a 27-year-old woman near Nelamangala Tuesday night. The survivor, originally from West Bengal, works as a beautician for weddings and other functions and lives with her husband and two sons. Another woman from her hometown and a man from Assam, a friend of her husband, also reside in the adjacent rented house. Her husband was at work when the incident occurred, according to sources.As per the survivor's complaint, five men barged into the house, claiming to be local police, around 9:30pm on Oct 21. ""They accused us of possessing ganja and being involved in a flesh trade, and demanded Rs 1 lakh. They then attacked me and another woman with a cricket bat and a machete. My friend nearly lost consciousness, but I managed to resist. They gagged my younger son and my husband's friend, locking them in the toilet. Three of them dragged me to a room in the adjacent house and raped me. They also robbed Rs 25,000 and two mobile phones,"" the survivor stated in her complaint.Her elder son, who was outside at the time, contacted the police control room. A patrolling Hoysala police vehicle soon arrived at the scene, but the suspects had fled the scene by then.The survivor, who was immediately shifted to a nearby hospital, filed her complaint from her hospital bed. Madanayakanahalli police registered a case of gang-rape under Section 70 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and launched a manhunt and in less than two days, cops detained a few suspects, including juveniles, for questioning.""By Wednesday night we arrested the accused – Naveen, Kartik, and Glani – and Thursday afternoon, three more suspects—Suyog, Jangli Prithvi, and Seena—were taken into custody. We are still searching for the prime suspect—Mithun, who orchestrated the attack and involved others,"" a senior from Bengaluru Rural police officer said.Preliminary investigations revealed that Mithun, a local resident, had disputes with the survivor. ""The family has been living here for six months. Mithun and the survivor had frequent arguments, and he had threatened to teach her a lesson. That is why he brought his associates, posing as police, to carry out the attack,"" the officer added.Police said while three men allegedly raped the woman, two accused have stated they only beat her and stole cash and phones. Both the survivor and the accused have undergone medical examinations, and the reports are expected to provide further clarity on the incident.","Bengaluru rural police have arrested three youths in connection with the alleged gang-rape of a 27-year-old woman near nelamangala.

""Congress Only Party To Respect Him..."" Pappu Yadav Alleges BJP Sidelining Nitish Kumar in NDA

Poll Do you believe Nitish Kumar's return to NDA is a positive move for Bihar? Yes, it's a great decision No, it's not beneficial

NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), saying he had joined the party “because of circumstances.” Reaffirming his commitment to the NDA , he said he is “back in NDA for good.” He also criticised the RJD’s rule before his 20-year tenure as chief minister, saying, “pehle bahut bura haal tha,” and highlighted the shortcomings of the Lalu-Rabri governments, taking aim at their administration.Addressing his first election rally in Minapur, Muzaffarpur, Kumar took a dig at his rival Lalu Prasad and said, “Because of circumstances, I had to tie up with those people, but it did not take me long to realise that they were good for nothing. Now I am back (in NDA) for good.”Kumar recalled that his earlier alliances with the RJD in 2015 and 2022 both lasted less than two years. On both occasions, Lalu’s son Tejashwi Yadav, now leader of the opposition in Vidhan Sabha, served as his deputy chief minister.He highlighted his government’s focus on improving infrastructure, education, and healthcare in Bihar, and praised the Narendra Modi government at the Centre for its support.Talking about law and order, Kumar said, “An atmosphere of terror had prevailed in Bihar because of poor law and order and alleged patronage to criminals by the powers that be, until I took over. But now, it is for all to see how much things have changed.”He added that communal harmony has also improved. “Even disputes between Hindus and Muslims have come down because we were sensitive to needs like fencing of religious places of both faiths,” he said.Taking a swipe at Lalu Prasad, Kumar accused him of ignoring women’s welfare during his tenure. “Did the ones in power do anything for women? They could not have cared less. Only when, after seven years of chief ministership, a situation came where stepping down could not have been avoided, the wife was installed,” he said, referring to Rabri Devi’s appointment as chief minister in 1997.Kumar contrasted this with his own government’s focus on women’s empowerment, citing the success of self-help groups and the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, under which Rs 10,000 each has been transferred to over one crore women beneficiaries.Seeking a record fifth consecutive term, Nitish Kumar said he was disillusioned with the RJD after two short-lived alliances and has now decided to stay with the NDA for good.","Bihar chief minister nitish kumar reflected on his past alliances with the rashtriya janata dal.

The man's relatives said he had been mentally disturbed for a few weeks and had discussed seeking professional help.According to witnesses, the man, Sonu Barai (24), who was unemployed but occasionally worked as a cook, and his ex, Manisha Yadav (24), who lived in his locality and was also unemployed, were on Dattaram Lad Marg near Chinchpokli, walking towards Parel around 10.30am when they began arguing. Within seconds, Barai pulled out a kitchen knife and began stabbing Yadav on the road, an eyewitness told TOI.""I was walking right behind them. The woman screamed and ran towards Aastha Nursing Home nearby. He chased her."" Barai caught up with Yadav inside the facility and continued to stab her in front of the staff and many bystanders. Amid panic, many attempted to stop him-some even picked up stones and bamboo sticks to threaten him-but nothing deterred Barai. As the crowd closed in on him, Barai turned the knife on himself and slit his throat.","Sonu barai, 24, repeatedly stabbed his ex-girlfriend manisha yadav in the middle of a road in full public view. He chased her into a nursing home 50m away, and kept stabbing her there till she collapsed near chinchpokli in central mumbai.
