‘My party made me go here and there’: Nitish Kumar on staying with NDA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/my-party-made-me-go-here-and-there-nitish-kumar-on-staying-with-nda/articleshow/120886206.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday attributed his previous switch from the BJP-led NDA to his party colleagues while firmly committing to the alliance's future.Crediting the BJP for his rise to power, Nitish said that former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had made him chief minister for the first time.""I am going to remain here always. My party made me go here and there a couple of times earlier, but this is not going to happen again. Who made me CM? It was the late Atal Bihari Vajpayee,"" Nitish said.His remarks come days after he blamed his close aide, Rajiv Ranjan alias Lallan Singh, for the break-up with the BJP, accusing the saffron party of trying to split the JD(U). Nitish’s confession came at a rally in Madhubani in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""We had been together since the beginning. It was my party colleague sitting here who caused me to go astray,"" the JD(U) supremo said, pointing toward Lallan Singh.""We had fought them (RJD) together. He (Lallan) knows it well. He has been in the party for long and even served as its president. He, too, finally realised that they (RJD) were up to some mischief,"" he added.Lallan was then the national president of the JD(U), and he stepped down just a month before Kumar abruptly exited the INDIA bloc, which both leaders had helped form.Speculation had been rife that Lallan was made to resign due to perceptions that he had grown too close to the RJD, headed by Kumar's long-time rival, Lalu Prasad Yadav The JD(U) and BJP's alliance dates back to the 1990s. It first broke in 2013 over disagreements regarding the elevation of PM Modi, who was chief minister of Gujarat as the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate.Kumar later allied with RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, but that alliance lasted only until 2017, when he returned to the NDA fold.The alliance continued until 2022, when Kumar once again joined hands with the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan, vowing to defeat the BJP and accusing it of attempting to split his party.However, ahead of the Lok Sabha polls last year, Nitish returned to the NDA, abandoning the INDIA bloc that he had helped form by uniting parties opposed to the BJP.","Bihar chief minister nitish kumar credits the bjp for his rise to power.

Residents fear the worst as desilting work lags in Delhi

Poll Should the deadline for desilting work be extended to ensure completion before the monsoon? No, it should stay as is Yes, it should be extended

NEW DELHI: MCD's status report for desilting of drains reveals that the civic body completed only 21.3% of the work by April 25. With the initial deadline for finishing the work set for May 31, the progress so far appears insufficient.Of the target of 1.3 lakh metric tonnes to be lifted and taken to designated sites by May end, only 27,000 MT was cleared from drains more than 4 feet deep, as per the report.The civic body didn't comment on the issue while several RWAs reported that no desilting had taken place in their localities. To meet the target, the pace needs to be significantly increased, they said. Desilting is done in two phases. Phase I is carried out before monsoon from Jan 1 to May 31, when 60% of the cleaning is done to mitigate the chances of waterlogging during the rainy season.The deadline for this is often extended to June 15. Phase II of the work is taken up post-monsoon to ensure uninterrupted flow of drains.The civic body is working in all 12 zones in the capital after engaging machinery and equipment. There are 800 drains over 4ft deep in MCD's jurisdiction, spread over a 530km area.As of now, work is on at 253 places, while work at none of the drains has been completed yet.""In phase I, the civic body targeted to lift 1,29,392.8 metric tonnes of silt, and of this, 27,589 MT of silt was removed by April 25, which amounts to 21.3%,"" as per the report seen by TOI.In phase II this year, the silt removal target has been set at 84,466.6 MT. This has taken the total target of MCD for removing silt in 2025-26 to 2,13,859.5 MT.Besides, work is on at drains in the residential colonies in the capital and those less than 4ft deep.""These drains are cleared throughout the year. There are 12,892 such drains spread over an area of 6,069.8km, with a target to remove 40,086 MT of silt. Of this, 9,474.8 MT has been achieved by the end of April, which accounts for 24% of the work,"" said the report.According to the report, 100% of the work has been done in Sadar Paharganj zone, followed by 57% in Najafgarh zone and 44.8% in Keshavpuram.Residents, however, said that the Friday morning downpour, accompanied by gusty winds, exposed the lack of preparedness of the Delhi govt and the municipal authorities.""Widespread waterlogging affected the city, particularly at known trouble spots. Internal lanes of New Friends Colony, Janakpuri and Azadpur were also flooded. I think authorities need to fix the problem and complete their task in coordination rather than later blaming each other for waterlogging,"" said A N Gupta, a resident of Janakpuri.MCD reported 16 complaints of waterlogging from Vasant Vihar, Defence Colony, Pul Bangash, Fatehpur Beri, Shastri Bagh and Rana Pratap Bagh on Friday.""Complaints were received through email, call centre and hotline numbers. These were immediately conveyed to the staff and resolved,"" said the official.","Mcd's status report for desilting of drains reveals that the civic body completed only 21.3% of the work by april 25.

Poll Should drivers carry personal safety devices for protection against road rage? No, it's not necessary Yes, absolutely

NEW DELHI: An e-rickshaw driver was arrested for allegedly slashing a cabbie's neck with a blade in an incident of road rage in southwest Delhi's Dabri area.The victim, Gagandeep Singh (33), left bleeding and seriously injured, is recovering. Singh, who lives in Gurgaon's Sector 107, stopped his car at a red light on Dabri-Dwarka Road on way to his in-laws' house in Vikaspuri on the night of April 30. His mother was also in the cab.As they waited at the signal, an e-rickshaw hit the car from behind. When Singh stepped out and asked the e-rickshaw driver to drive more carefully, the man began threatening him before pulling out a blade concealed under his tongue and slashed his neck.The cabbie who was injured in an incident of road rage here tried to defuse the situation and attempted to reason with the driver of the e-rickshaw that hit his car. But instead of calming down, the accused suddenly attacked the cabbie, Gagandeep Singh.Despite bleeding heavily, Singh managed to call the police and reached Indira Gandhi Hospital on his own for treatment. Passers-by who witnessed the incident quickly intervened in the matter.They caught the attacker and detained him until the police arrived. The accused was later identified as Rajendra(23), a resident of Rajapuri in southwest Delhi.A senior police officer confirmed the arrest and said that a case was registered under appropriate sections of BNS for causing grievous hurt.The weapon used in the assault, a sharp blade, was recovered from his possession during the arrest.Gagandeep is currently recovering from his injuries, while police continue to investigate the background of the accused and whether he has a history of similar violent behaviour.In another incident of road rage that turned deadly last month, a 40-year-old motorcyclist was bludgeoned to death after his bike brushed against an SUV in west Delhi's Ranhola area.The 28-year-old car driver allegedly lured him to a secluded spot after an argument, killed him by hitting him on the head with a brick, and then dumped his body in a drain.The motorcyclist's body was found three days later, and the accused SUV driver was later arrested.","E-rickshaw driver arrested for allegedly slashing a cabbie's neck with a blade in an incident of road rage in southwest delhi's dabri area.

Poll Do you support the implementation of social security for gig workers in Rajasthan? No Yes

JAIPUR: Congress-governed Telangana's draft Gig and Platform Workers (Registration, Social Security, and Welfare) Bill is reigniting a conversation that the party's erstwhile stronghold, Rajasthan, once led - only to let the momentum slip.As the desert state's pioneering 2023 Rajasthan Platform-Based Gig Workers (Registration and Welfare) Act lies entangled in red tape, bike taxi rider Krishna Kumar Chaudhary wakes up each morning knowing exactly how his day will end - exhausted, barely breaking even, and unable to secure a better future for his son.For thousands like him in Rajasthan's gig economy , the 2023 law signalled hope that has since evaporated in the cycle of political transition, bureaucratic delay, and corporate pressures.Krishna Kumar, general secretary of the Rajasthan Gig and App-based Workers' Union, earns Rs 700-1,000 daily ferrying passengers on his motorbike. After accounting for platform fees (Rs 100), petrol (Rs 300 approx) and maintenance (Rs 100), he is left with a maximum of Rs 400.""My room rent alone is Rs 4,000 a month. I borrow from friends to survive. I want my son to study in a private school, but I can't afford it,"" Kumar says.Gul Mohammed Mansoori, 50, works for a goods transport company that operates through a platform and leaves drivers to fend for themselves when customers don't pay.""The platforms deduct a 12% commission on each trip but take no responsibility for non-payment of dues. Drivers are asked to pursue customers for payments. I earn around Rs 3,000 a week and occasionally Rs 5,000 - but that's not enough,"" he tells TOI.Mansoori makes Jaipuri quilts, especially during the lean season, to earn a few thousand extra rupees.Rajasthan's attempt to legislate protection was the first such initiative in the country, promising social and financial security for an estimated five lakh employees driving the state's Rs 25,000-crore gig economy.Enacted by the then Ashok Gehlot govt, it aimed to create a welfare board, establish a Rs 200-crore welfare fund, and impose a 2% cess on aggregators to provide health and accident insurance, pensions, provident fund, and school education for children of workers,The Bhajan Lal Sharma led-BJP govt announced an allocation of Rs 350 crore in this year's state Budget to the Gig and Unorganised Workers Development Fund, a Rs 100-crore increase over last year's outlay. It remains unclear when the corpus will be created, or how the benefits will reach the intended targets.Home minister Amit Shah's announcement of a cooperative framework for 50 lakh app-based drivers nationwide has rekindled a semblance of hope.The model, allowing registration of two-wheelers, taxis, rickshaws, and four-wheelers, aims for democratic management and equitable profit distribution among drivers.Under the umbrella of the National Campaign for Cooperatives in Platform and Transport Economy, gig workers are also in talks with the Union cooperatives ministry for a taxi cooperative called ""Sahkar Taxi"" that will enable drivers to operate as entrepreneurs without having to pay commissions to existing platform service-providers.NITI Aayog projects India's gig economy will grow to 2.35 crore workers by 2029-30. Gig unions, like the Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers (IFAT), propose funding social security through taxes, cess, CSR, platform contributions, and more. IFAT's national general secretary, Shaik Salauddin, says home minister Shah's cooperative model must involve workers to avoid replicating exploitative practices. ""We need driver-led models that prioritise rights over profits. We are ready to collaborate for a true alternative.""Jaipur taxi driver Suresh Prajapati, 26, awaits the day workers like him don't have to depend on platforms. ""If driving is your only source of income, relying on Ola or Uber won't suffice. I make ends meet by building my base of personal customers. I have registered with the Centre's e-Shram portal in the hope that there will be some benefits someday.""","2 years on, t’gana gig workers’ bill catches raj’s landmark law ‘napping’ telangana's draft gig and platform workers (registration, social security, and welfare) bill is reigniting conversation.

We want freedom of expression, which has not been allowed under the Congress in the past.""The student also referred to the Anandpur Sahib resolution , which he claimed the Congress mis-characterized as a separatist manifesto. He criticized the party's failure to reconcile with the Sikh community and pointed to convicted former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar as evidence of lingering impunity, and said, ""Many more Sajjan Kumars are sitting in Congress party.""In response, Rahul admitted that Congress had committed many ""mistakes"" when he was not there, but added that he was more than happy to take responsibility for everything the party had ever done wrong. He pointed out that he had publicly stated that what happened in the 1980s was ""wrong"".BJP also attacked Rahul for calling Lord Ram ""a mythological figure"" at the same interaction.",Student asked rahul what attempts he was making to reconcile with the sikh community.

Poll Do you support the challenges against the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025? No, I do not support the challenges. Yes, I support the challenges.

Government: Waqf law rivals spreading falsehood

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court will decide on Monday whether and what interim order could be passed on petitions challenging the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025, on the ground that its provisions interfered with the traditional and historic link of waqfs with Islam and violated Article 26 which guarantees freedom of religious affairs.A three-judge bench headed by CJI Sanjiv Khanna , who is scheduled to retire on May 13, has limited time to take up final hearing of the matter as it would require hearing many lawyers from the petitioners' side and the Union govt, which as an interim response to the petitions has filed an over 1,300-page affidavit.The court had picked five lead petitions from the over 150 and named them as 'In Re: The Waqf Amendment Act' to restrict the number of advocates who could argue for the petitioners. Even then, the hearing on the necessity of interim order could be time consuming as every counsel on the petitioners side has so far promised to make a new point and sought an opportunity to argue.Defending the Act as a secular law, the Centre on Friday accused the petitioners of spinning a false ""interference in religious affairs"" narrative on mandatory registration of every waqf, including 'waqf by user', and said this provision was more than a century old. Ministry of minority affairs in a 1,332-page affidavit has requested the SC to fall back on the traditional assumption of validity of the law enacted by Parliament and conduct a detailed hearing without granting any stay on operation of the law which is to stop misuse of the 2013 amendment which the govt says allowed encroachment of private and govt properties.The ministry requested the SC, which had flagged three issues in the 2025 law - registration documents of waqf properties, inclusion of non-Muslims in Waqf Council and Waqf Boards and determination of govt land - for an equitable approach by arguing that though challenge to the validity of Waqf Act, 1995, was pending for a long time, the court had never contemplated staying certain provisions of the 30-year-old law.""Till 2013, the total area under waqf was 18.3 lakh acres. It is really shocking to note that after 2013, another 20.9 lakh acres of land were added to waqfs, which totalled 39.2 lakh acres,"" the ministry had said.","Supreme court will decide on monday whether and what interim order could be passed on petitions challenging the waqf amendment act, 2025.

Will safeguard state’s waters, says Punjab Cong; SAD petitions PM

Poll Should Punjab consider negotiations with Haryana to resolve the water-sharing issue? No, stand firm on water rights. Yes, dialogue is essential.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab assembly will hold a special session Monday as the decades-old water-sharing dispute with Haryana reignited. The session follows Centre's directive for Punjab to release an additional 4,500 cusecs a day to Haryana from Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) reservoirs for eight days.The move, adding to the existing 4,000 cusecs a day already flowing to Haryana, has drawn resistance from Punjab, which contends it has no surplus water to spare. State officials said Haryana has already exceeded its quota and current flow was allowed only on humanitarian grounds.Punjab boycotted a BBMB partner states meeting Saturday, protesting the short notice and asserting it will not engage further until the assembly session concludes. According to Punjab, BBMB regulations require a seven-day notice for special meetings. Two previous meetings were also held with just a day’s notice.The row comes ahead of the annual BBMB water allocation cycle beginning May 21. The dispute escalated after Centre, represented by Union home secretary Govind Mohan, sided with Haryana’s demand despite Punjab’s objections. On April 30, both state officials attended a BBMB meeting where the board ordered the release of 8,500 cusecs to Haryana.Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann convened an all-party meeting Friday, followed by the assembly session call. All political parties in Punjab expressed solidarity, although BJP politicians said Haryana had received additional water in the past, suggesting the current crisis was avoidable.In a parallel move, Haryana held its own all-party meeting, with unanimous backing for its position. Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini claimed Punjab had agreed to the extra release, prompting Mann to call the statement “completely false and misleading” in a sharply worded letter, accusing BJP-led Union and Haryana govts of “bullying tactics against the people of Punjab”.Leader of opposition Partap Singh Bajwa said after a Congress legislature party meeting: “We are prepared. We will safeguard the state’s waters and interests,” adding the party would withhold its full strategy from the press. Despite a united front, Punjab’s political parties have a long record of trading blame over the state’s water disputes.SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal appealed to PM Narendra Modi to intervene, criticising AAP govt in Punjab. “The current rulers of the state are playing with fire by openly promising to release water to Haryana and Rajasthan,” he said. “Our CM Bhagwant Mann’s belated posturing is like shutting the door after the horse has bolted.”Of SAD’s three MLAs in the 117-member assembly, only Ganieve Kaur Majithia remains aligned with the party.

ICAR: World’s first genome-edited rice varieties to boost yields 30%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/icar-worlds-first-genome-edited-rice-varieties-to-boost-yields-30/articleshow/120883169.cms,"Poll Do you believe genome-edited rice varieties can significantly improve agricultural yields in India? No, I have my doubts. Yes, absolutely!

NEW DELHI: The Indian Council of Agricultural Research ( ICAR ) - the country's premier agriculture research organisation - has developed the world's first genome-edited improved varieties of rice to boost yields by 20-30%, conserve water and reduce emission of methane - a potent greenhouse gas.Releasing the two genome-edited varieties - ' DRR Dhan 100 (Kamala)' and ' Pusa DST Rice 1 ' - Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Sunday said these two climate-resilient and high yielding varieties would ensure a second green revolution in the country. He instructed ICAR officials to make these seeds available to farmers at the earliest.""Scientists are currently in the process of getting Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) of these two varieties. Certified seeds will reach farmers for cultivation in minimum two years,"" said an official.Genome-editing, particularly the CRISPR-Cas technology , is being recognised as a breakthrough in precision breeding. It enables scientists to make targeted changes in the native genes of living organisms, and creating new and desirable traits without introducing foreign DNA.ICAR claimed that the cultivation of these improved rice varieties in about five million hectares of the recommended area will produce 4.5 million tons of additional paddy, save a minimum 7,500 million cubic meters of irrigation water due short-duration maturity (20 days early), and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20%. ""Development of these two varieties using genome-editing technology has paved the way for using this innovative method in other crops too for higher yields, climate resilience and improved quality to achieve the targets of 'Viksit Bharat',"" said an ICAR statement.Genome-edited 'Kamala' is recommended for cultivation across major rice-growing states, including Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. The other new variety - 'Pusa DST Rice 1' - is also recommended for cultivation in most of these states.Recognizing the transformative potential of the new technology, ICAR initiated a genome-editing research project in rice in 2018 and selected two widely cultivated mega rice varieties - 'Samba Mahsuri (BPT5204)' and 'MTU1010 (Cottondora Sannalu)' - to further enhance their qualities through technological interventions.ICAR scientists eventually enhanced these varieties with better stress tolerance, improved yield, and climate adaptability without compromising their existing strengths, and developed the two new genome-edited varieties 'Kamala' and 'Pusa DST Rice 1'.",The indian council of agricultural research ( icar) has developed the world's first genome-edited improved varieties of rice to boost yields by 20-30%.

BHOPAL: Police have rescued 16 mentally challenged and destitute men held in modern-day slavery for years - some for two decades - under inhumane conditions in two villages in MP's Guna district, arresting 11 people linked to a widespread trafficking and bonded labour network spanning many states.""They were treated worse than animals,"" an officer involved in the rescue said.The victims - rescued from Binaganj and Cachoda areas, 150km from Bhopal and close to Rajasthan border - were trapped under a local exploitation system known as 'Rahua', a term derived from the regional dialect meaning 'Raho aur Khao' - stay and eat. But behind the seemingly benign phrase lies a brutal form of bondage. Victims were forced to work long hours in return for nothing more than leftover food and a place to sleep, often among cattle. There were no wages, no basic rights, and no way out. Most of the men had been trafficked after being found wandering on highways or abandoned by truck drivers. Once in captivity,they were roped into a network of forced labour across agricultural fields, cattle sheds, brick kilns, roadside eateries, and homes.District collector Kishore Kumar Kanyal said 16 men have been shifted to care centres in Shivpuri, where they are receiving medical and psychological support. Their families are being located.","Mp police rescue 16 from slavery in guna, arrest 1. Victims - rescued from binaganj and cachoda areas, 150km from bhopal and close to rajasthan border.

The opposition party asked the PM if he will accept that he has taken a U-turn on the issue.To amplify its attacks on BJP, Congress has directed its state units to hold statewide rallies at the assembly level to showcase the role of Congress and Rahul Gandhi in making caste census a reality, with the directive that they should highlight that BJP has been against the idea.

Dasmohapatra was questioned Sunday by Puri temple authorities as part of an ongoing government probe into the claims.""Action will be taken against those responsible if found guilty of illegally using Jagannath temple's sacred timber to build the idols of Digha Jagannath temple.

""If they (BJP) question the establishment of a Hindu temple, this shows their desperation. On one hand, BJP claims to be a 'Hinduwadi' party, on the other, they are raising questions on the pratishtha (sanctity) of the (Digha) temple. If there is any question on the establishment, it should be asked by the four Shankaracharyas,"" TMC spokesperson Jay Prakash Majumdar said.Craftsmen from Puri temple have, however, dismissed claims that excess neem wood had been used to build the three idols of the Digha shrine. According to them, the surplus wood that had been stored after making the idols of Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra and Devi Subhadra during the 2015 Nabakalebara (creation of new idols) Rath Yatra, were too small, ranging between 3 and 10 inches, making them unsuitable for construction of the idols.Opposition BJD and Congress, meanwhile, have criticised BJP for allegedly failing to handle the situation. Senior Congress neta Niranjan Patnaik said it is a matter of grave concern as the issue involves emotional connect of 4.5 crore Odias to Lord Jagannath, the Jagannath Temple, and its culture. ""Odisha government must intervene to protect this heritage amid potential threats,"" Patnaik said.Former CM Naveen Patnaik's BJD criticised the state government's apparent lack of initiative in protecting Jagannath culture. ""Despite four days having passed since the Digha temple's inauguration on April 30, the state government has not officially raised the matter with West Bengal,"" senior BJD leader Prasanna Acharya said.

Poll Should all individuals involved in a gangrape be held equally responsible? No Yes

Common intention is essence of joint liability: SC

NEW DELHI: Holding that it is not necessary for the prosecution to adduce clinching proof of complete act of rape by each one of the accused to convict all for gangrape, Supreme Court has reiterated that in cases of gangrape, even if one commits rape, all the other persons involved should be held responsible and be equally punished.A bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and K V Viswanathan rejected the plea of an accused who claimed that he was not named along with other accused by the survivor in the FIR and his role was confined to helping the main accused.Rejecting the plea, the bench said, ""In a case of gangrape under Section 376(2)(g), an act by one is enough to render all in the gang for punishment as long as they have acted in furtherance of the common intention. Further, common intention is implicit in the charge of Section 376(2)(g) itself and all that is needed is evidence to show the existence of common intention.""Referring to earlier SC verdicts, the bench said in order to establish an offence under Section 376(2)(g) IPC, the prosecution must adduce evidence to indicate that more than one accused had acted in concert and in such an event, if rape had been committed by even one, all the accused would be guilty irrespective of the fact that the woman had been raped by one or more of them and it was not necessary for the prosecution to adduce evidence of a completed act of rape by each one of the accused.In other words, this provision embodies a principle of joint liability and the essence of that liability is the existence of common intention; that common intention presupposes prior concert which may be determined from the conduct of offenders revealed during the course of action and it could arise and be formed suddenly, but there must be meeting of minds and it is not enough to have the same intention independently of each of the offenders,"" it said.","Justices sanjay karol and k v viswanathan rejected the plea of an accused who claimed that he was not named along with other accused by the survivor in the fir.
