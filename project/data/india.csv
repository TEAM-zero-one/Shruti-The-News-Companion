Train halted, tyres Burnt

'SIR a normal exercise'

NEW DELHI: The Mahagathbandhan alliance on Wednesday kicked off a ""Bihar Bandh"" protesting against the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls by the Election Commission Opposition leaders, including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and RJD's Tejashwi Yadav, will lead a protest rally in Patna and plan to encircle the Chief Electoral Office in the state capital.Earlier, the former deputy chief minister said that the opposition had called for the Bihar Bandh to vent their ire against the ongoing voter list revision ahead of the upcoming assembly elections.“We will enforce a ‘chakka jam’ on July 9. Both the Election Commission and the government will be targeted by the Opposition. It is quite surprising that the EC is changing its orders every hour. As a result, BLOs and other officials engaged in the verification exercise are confused,” Tejashwi said.The Opposition has alleged that the Election Commission, through its special intensive revision of electoral rolls, is snatching voting rights from migrants, Dalits, Mahadalits, and poor voters, calling the campaign a “conspiracy to block votes” ahead of the Bihar Assembly Elections , which are due in three months.Workers from the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and CPM burnt tyres and blocked roads in support of the Bihar Bandh on NH-30 in Patna's Maner.Party workers were seen raising banners and shouting slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Bharatiya Janata Party, and the Election Commission.Meanwhile, RJD's student wing blocked train tracks and NH-82 in Jehanabad.RJD workers also stopped the Namo Bharat train in Darbhanga.“We have called this Bandh against the Election Commission, which is working as per someone’s agenda… The public is tired of the government. RJD and the entire INDIA alliance have called for the Bandh,” an RJD worker said.Supporters of Independent MP Pappu Yadav also stopped an express train in Narpatganj, Araria.Also read | Bharat Bandh today: Public services likely to be hit; 10 things to know about nationwide strike The poll body has claimed that the exercise is a standard procedure to update the voter list before every election as mandated by law. It has also undertaken a drive to weed out foreign illegal migrants from the electoral rolls in six states, starting with Bihar.The poll panel reminded the constitutional provision that says only Indian citizens can vote. ""The Constitution of India is supreme. All citizens, political parties, and the Election Commission of India follow the Constitution,"" EC said in a statement.The poll panel already has nearly 78,000 booth-level officers (BLOs) and is appointing over 20,000 more for new polling stations, it said.More than one lakh volunteers will be assisting genuine electors, particularly the old, sick, persons with disabilities, poor, and other vulnerable groups during the special intensive revision.Out of the existing 7,89,69,844 electors, 4.96 crore electors, whose names are already in the last intensive revision of the Electoral Roll on January 1, 2003, have to ""simply verify so, fill the Enumeration Form and submit it.""The enumeration form should be filled between 25 June and 26 July, after which the draft voter list will be published on 1 August 2025; the period for filing claims and objections will be from 1 August to 1 September, and the final voter list will be published on 30 September.","Mahagathbandhan alliance on wednesday kicked off a ""bihar bandh"" protesting against the ongoing special intensive revision (sir) of electoral rolls by the election commission.

Why are workers protesting?

Bharat Bandh : Here are 10 things to know -



The organisers expect more than 25 crore people across various sectors to take part in the bandh. This includes workers from both organised and unorganised sectors, with strong participation expected from farmers and rural workers as well.

The unions leading the strike include INTUC, AITUC, CITU, HMS, SEWA, AIUTUC, AICCTU, LPF, UTUC, and TUCC. These unions have come together to raise concerns about the government's labour and economic policies.

They are especially critical of the new labour codes, which they claim will weaken workers' rights, extend working hours, and make it harder to form unions or go on strike.

They are also demanding more government jobs, an increase in MGNREGA wages and workdays, and similar employment schemes for urban areas.

The unions have submitted a 17-point demand list to the Labour Minister, but they say there has been no serious response from the government.

Banks are expected to remain open, as July 9 is not a holiday listed by the Reserve Bank of India. However, banking services could still be disrupted if bank workers join the strike.

On the other hand, stock markets will function as usual, and there is no scheduled trading holiday.

Schools, colleges, and government offices are expected to remain open as well. No official closure has been announced.

However, public transport services may be affected in many regions, which could lead to delays for commuters, students, and office-goers. In past strikes, participation levels varied by location, and some areas saw last-minute announcements affecting school operations.

This is not the first time the trade unions have organised such a protest. Similar strikes were held on November 26, 2020, March 28–29, 2022, and February 16, 2024, focusing on issues like privatisation of public sector units, job insecurity, and the casualisation of the workforce.

NEW DELHI: The central trade unions have announced a nationwide strike for Wednesday, with over 25 crore workers from various sectors expected to participate.The strike is also supported by several rural and agricultural labour organisations. The unions say they are protesting against government policies that help big businesses but hurt workers, farmers, and the poor.The unions also claimed that government departments were increasingly hiring retired personnel instead of young professionals, citing examples from the Railways, NMDC Ltd, the steel sector, and education services. They argue this trend is harmful in a country where 65 percent of the population is under 35, and unemployment is highest among those aged 20 to 25.Also read | Bharat Bandh 2025: Will schools, colleges & govt offices be closed on July 9?","The organisers expect more than 25 crore people across various sectors to take part in the bandh.

I book my return tickets first. You should take this issue seriously.""""The pollution in Delhi has led to a decrease in the life expectancy of common people,"" added Gadkari, who is also an MP from Nagpur.He further continued that it is the responsibility of all stakeholders to help reduce pollution caused by vehicle emissions from fossil fuels.He also outlined several key steps being taken to combat pollution and promote environmental sustainability, according to news agency PTI.He said the government is actively promoting alternative fuels like ethanol and carrying out large-scale plantation drives to reduce pollution.Gadkari added that around 80 lakh tonnes of waste have been used in road construction as part of the government's efforts to reuse materials and protect the environment.""We are also prioritising water conservation by adopting measures like rainwater harvesting on our highways,"" the road transport and highways minister added.An official statement from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said the agency is working to create green corridors through initiatives like bamboo plantations, dense tree planting, and vertical landscaping.In 2024-25, NHAI planted nearly 67 lakh trees, surpassing its target of 60 lakh.

Bihar form collection nears halfway mark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-form-collection-nears-halfway-mark/articleshow/122329893.cms,"NEW DELHI: On a day the collection of signed enumeration forms under the special intensive revision (SIR) in Bihar just about touched the half-way mark, chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar defended the exercise, saying that “a pure electoral roll is inevitable for strengthening democracy”.Kumar’s statement came amid a flurry of legal challenges filed against SIR in the Supreme Court by 11 opposition parties, seeking a stay on the exercise that they claim shall “disenfranchise lakhs of voters in Bihar”. Incidentally, these very parties have been questioning the health of electoral rolls based on which Maharashtra elections were held last year, alleging arbitrary inclusions.“During the past four months, all 4,123 electoral registration officers (EROs), 775 district election officers (DEOs) and 36 chief electoral officers (CEOs) have held nearly 5,000 meetings with 28,000 political party representatives. ECI has also invited all recognised political parties for interaction. No one was satisfied with the current status of electoral rolls for one reason or the other,” according to Kumar. EC on Tuesday said 18.2% enumeration forms received in Bihar were now uploaded on ECINET. As of 6 pm on Tuesday around 47% forms had been collected, with 10.5% in the last 24 hours. “Maintaining the same momentum, with 50% forms remaining to be collected, the exercise would be completed well in time,” EC said.“The final roll will be published as scheduled on Sept 30, 2025,” an officer told TOI.EC officials on Tuesday underlined that SIR order dated 2406.2025 stands on four pillars — being all-inclusive in terms of coverage of electors; inclusion of all those who submit their signed enumeration forms by July 25, in the draft roll to be published on August 1, while allowing eligibility documents to be submitted till Sept 1; deciding eligibility of the elector as per Article 326 of the Constitution and Section 16 and 19 of Representation of the People Act, 1950; and exclusion only after inquiry by the ERO, who can rely on field inquiry and documents beyond the 11 listed by EC.Commission officials said pre-filled enumeration forms have been distributed to 7.7 crore of the 7.9 crore electors, with the remaining likely dead, shifted or migrated. Booth level officers are currently making the second of three visits to households to collect the filled-up forms. Volunteers are facilitating the old, sick, persons with disabilities (PwDs) and the poor to complete the forms.The draft roll to be out on August 1 will list all those who submit enumeration forms by July 25. Documents may be submitted separately till July 25 and also during the claims and objections period.All citizens of India aged 18 years and above and who are ordinarily resident in the constituency where they seek to be enrolled, unless disqualified, must be enrolled, as per SIR guidelines.Exclusion of a voter would be only after inquiry by ERO, based on scrutiny of the documents submitted (as per indicative and not exhaustive list mentioned by SIR guidelines) and a field report. The ERO/AERO shall pass a ‘speaking order’ on any exclusion, with due notice to such elector.Though the final roll will be published on September 30, two-stage appeals may be filed against the ERO’s decision, first with the district magistrate and then the CEO, as per Section 24 of the R P Act, 1950.","The draft roll to be out on august 1 will list all those who submit enumeration forms by july 25.

Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha? Government to take call on Yashwant Varma removal route,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lok-sabha-or-rajya-sabha-government-to-take-call-on-yashwant-varma-removal-route/articleshow/122329771.cms,"Justice Yashwant Varma

Others who faced removal

NEW DELHI: With many from the Opposition parties indicating support for the move to evict him from judiciary, the government is soon to take a call on whether to bring the motion for the removal of Justice Yashwant Varma, in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha in the Monsoon session of Parliament, beginning on July 21. The law requires a motion for removal to be endorsed by 100 LS MPs. The required number is 50 in the case of Rajya Sabha.Govt has been holding consultations with the Opposition parties. The process for removal of a judge of the Supreme Court, or a high court, is provided under Article 124(4) of the Constitution, which says that ""a Judge of the SC, or the high court, shall not be removed from his office except by an order of the President passed after an address by each House of Parliament supported by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting has been presented to the President in the same session for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. ""To initiate a removal proceeding, Constitution has laid down very stringent conditions under the Judges (Inquiry) Act, which requires Parliament to set up a three-member committee comprising the Chief Justice of India or a judge of the Supreme Court, a chief justice of a high court and a noted jurist, to probe with evidence if the judge was indeed guilty of ""misbehaviour or incapacity"".The committee is constituted only after a motion is moved in Parliament for removal, addressed to the President 'praying for the removal of a judge'.Once the motion is moved, Speaker of Lok Sabha or the Chairman of Rajya Sabha, as the case may be, may consider admitting the motion and constitute an inquiry committee under Section 3(2) of Judges (Inquiry) Act.In this case, the Supreme Court has already constituted a three-member in-house inquiry committee comprising chief justices of Punjab and Haryana high court and Himachal Pradesh high court, and a judge of Karnataka high court. Based on their findings and examination and recording of statements of more than 50 witnesses, the then CJI Sanjiv Khanna recommended Justice Varma's removal to the President and the Prime Minister.The govt is likely to share the findings of the in-house report with the inquiry committee, which is mandated to be set up by Parliament after a motion for removal is adopted, under Judges (Inquiry) Act: something which may help the panel and enable it to submit its report soon.As reported by TOI earlier, Justice Soumitra Sen of Calcutta high court was the first judge against whom the Rajya Sabha had voted with the required majority on a removal motion in 2011. But the judge finally resigned to avoid his removal. The first case of a removal motion in Parliament was against Justice V Ramaswami, a judge of SC, in 1991. But he escaped being removed as the motion failed to secure the required two-thirds majority in Lok Sabha.Justice PD Dinakaran, the then chief justice of Sikkim high court, resigned in 2011 before the removal proceedings were initiated in Rajya Sabha. In 2015, a similar motion was moved in Rajya Sabha against Justice JB Pardiwala of Gujarat high court. However, the judge later removed a controversial statement from a judgment of his that had stoked the controversy. The latest case was against Justice SK Gangele of Madhya Pradesh high court when 58 MPs of Rajya Sabha moved the motion.However, an inquiry committee absolved the judge of sexual harassment charges against him.",Govt has been holding consultations with the opposition parties. The law requires a motion for removal to be endorsed by 100 ls mps. The first case of a removal motion in parliament was against justice v ramaswami in 1991.

PATNA: A senior govt doctor was allegedly administered the wrong treatment by a technical staff member, not a qualified physician, during her journey on the New Delhi-Patna Tejas Rajdhani Express, raising fresh concerns over the quality and oversight of medical assistance provided to passengers on trains.Dr Divya, head of the eye department at Bulandshahr District Hospital in Uttar Pradesh, was travelling to Patna on Saturday. Midway through the journey, she began experiencing gastric discomfort and dialled the railway helpline 139, requesting urgent medical assistance.According to Dr Divya, she received a call back from an official of the Prayagraj division under North Central Railway (NCR), who informed her that a fee would apply if she wanted medical attention.However, at Kanpur Central station that night, she was shocked when a technical staff member, not a qualified doctor, arrived to attend to her.""He administered an antibiotic, despite my symptoms being clearly related to gastric discomfort. When I identified myself as a senior medical professional and questioned the treatment, he remained silent but still insisted I pay Rs 350 for the visit and an additional Rs 32 for the medicines.""She added that while no receipt was given for the consultation fee, she was sent a medicine bill via an instant messaging platform. ""Even after repeated persuasion, I was not given a bill for the so-called doctor's visit,"" she said.Responding to the allegation, NCR's chief public relations officer Shashi Kant Tripathi said on Sunday, ""The Railway Board has fixed Rs 100 as a nominal fee in some cases for a doctor's visit to attend to a patient on board. There is no such fee like Rs 350 for a doctor's visit. The railways will inquire into the matter.""Dr Divya has lodged an online complaint with the Railway Board and NCR authorities.

DMK MP Kanimozhi’s Reply To Question On India's National Language Wins Applause In Spain

Poll Do you believe language barriers contribute to accidents at railway crossings? Yes No

NEW DELHI: In the tragic school van collision in Tamil Nadu that claimed the lives of three students on Tuesday, a fresh political angle has emerged. The ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) has alleged that a language barrier contributed to the incident, claiming the railway gateman posted at the crossing did not understand Tamil.According to the DMK, the lack of familiarity with the local language may have led to a critical communication lapse, ultimately resulting in the fatal crash.DMK Spokesperson TKS Elangovan said, ""Already there was an accident here and the Railway authority themselves stated that it was because the person did not know Tamil language. He could not understand what was told to him. The same thing has happened now. So, it is always better in such important positions that the people who know the local language should be posted so that it will be helpful. That will at least save the people. ""The incident occurred at approximately 7:45 am when a school van carrying students attempted to cross railway level crossing Gate No. 170 between Cuddalore and Alappakkam. The van was struck by Train No. 56813 Villupuram-Mayiladuthurai passenger.The collision caused the van to be thrown away from the crossing. The train's loco pilot managed to halt the train after some distance.Television footage revealed the severely damaged yellow school vehicle.Conflicting accounts emerged regarding the gate's status. Southern Railway maintained the crossing was closed, whilst the van driver requested opening to avoid delay. However, both the driver and an injured student assert the gate was open.The incident resulted in four fatalities, including three students initially and one who later died in hospital. The driver and another student were admitted to Government Hospital, Cuddalore/JIPMER Pondicherry. The incident occurred approximately 190 km from Chennai.Southern Railway's preliminary investigation indicated the gate was closed when the van arrived.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday attacked Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, accusing him of insulting President Droupadi Murmu and former President Ram Nath Kovind with ""derogatory and casteist"" remarks, and demanded an unconditional apology.Kharge allegedly made the derogatory remarks while speaking at an event in Chhattisgarh, where he referred to President Murmu as ""Murma ji"" and then went on to mispronounce the name of her predecessor Ram Nath Kovind before correcting himself. BJP said Kharge had deliberately sighted the President and Kovind. BJP also demanded that Congress remove Kharge.Congress, however, rubbished the charge with party member Pawan Khera alleging that the attack on Kharge was reflective of ""BJP's mentality"".Addressing a public rally in Raipur on Monday, Kharge also said BJP always talks big saying that it made Droupadi Murmu and Ram Nath Kovind presidents of the country, ""but did the party do all this to snatch our assets, forests, water and land?""BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia charged Congress of having an ""anti-tribal and anti-Dalit mindset"".Bhatia also alleged that Kharge mocked Kovind. He cited a reference to Kovind to allege that Kharge called the former President ""Covid"".""You call her 'Murma ji' and then call her a land mafia, alleging that she has become President to snatch away assets, forests,"" he charged.Talking to PTI, Khera dismissed BJP's charge, saying, ""This is rubbish. This is the kind of mentality that BJP has. You appoint a tribal leader as President of India but you do uncountable injustice to tribals of Chhattisgarh, Odisha and everywhere, you are literally exploiting their resources. You are cutting their trees. You are robbing their 'jal, jungle and zamin', their identity, but when we ask them a question, they'll say the President of India is a tribal.

But as the crowd grew after 10 am and voices of protest were raised, police allowed the march to proceed. CM Devendra Fadnavis said there was no objection to holding a march and police had suggested the usual route sanctioned for it, but MNS insisted on a particular route and hence nod was denied. ""The police chief informed me that police had inputs some of them were likely to do something,"" the CM said.Many MNS functionaries, including Avinash Jadhav, MNS Thane and Palghar district chief, were detained early morning. Jadhav was taken into preventive custody. Around 10am, people started gathering for the morcha, and as numbers swelled, cops began detaining people there as well.
