Experts at India Meteorological Department (IMD) expect some more rain Friday morning.The city received 4.3mm of rain Thursday. Though the day dawned with overcast conditions, the skies opened up only by noon. But within minutes, Bengaluru was reminded of how vulnerable it could be in case of heavy rain, with several roads and areas inundated.As many as 12 trees and 451 branches fell in various parts of the city. Though the downpour lasted only a short while in most areas, the impact lasted hours, with traffic crawling as the road conditions were unnavigable. To counter the vehicle pile-up, traffic police issued advisories on the go, on social media.The inundated stretches included the road from Domlur water tank to Domlur bridge, Kadugodi bridge towards Hoskote main road, Madiwala 29th Main road towards Silk Board, Palace Cross underpass, Ramamurthy Nagar underpass, Puttenahalli underpass towards JP Nagar, Inner Ring Road towards Indiranagar underpass, and HBR Layout towards Tin Factory.A tree fell at Chowdeshwari temple, near the National Games Village back gate, slowing down traffic. In Rajajinagar II Block, an uprooted tree landed on an SUV. By 6pm, six of the uprooted trees were cleared and 27 of the 41 fallen branches removed.IMD Bengaluru director CS Patil told TOI: ""While parts of the state were issued a yellow alert on Thursday, the intensity of rainfall will be less on Friday. Parts of Karnataka have only a thunderstorm alert.""He attributed the shower spells to strong south-easterly winds blowing from the Bay of Bengal. ""They bring in a lot of moisture into the interior land. And the past few days witnessed very high temperatures.

The speculation was that the suds were caused by Shikakai trees that react with rainwater and release saponins, and BBMP deputy conservator of forests BLG Swamy agreed. He told TOI that the foam, however, doesn't make the roads slippery. ""The seed, though, is dangerous to be lying around. But it is swept away each morning by sanitation workers.

There are indications the probe against TMC functionaries, including a very senior one, is expected to pick pace and fresh summons will be issued against other accused and suspects very soon.Sources said searches conducted by ED in this case in Aug 2023 had led to seizure of ""crucial evidence"", including those allegedly pointing to the involvement of many senior TMC functionaries, including one ""particularly close"" to CM Mamata Banerjee. The agency had also tracked a company involved in laundering the proceeds of crime in the teachers' recruitment scam, they saidIts investigation had turned up the role of Leaps and Bounds Pvt Ltd and its chief operating officer Sujay Krishna Bhadra - arrested for allegedly handling the proceeds of crime.In 2022, a money laundering probe was initiated by ED in the West Bengal teachers' recruitment case, which led to the recovery of Rs 50 crore in cash from two flats of a ""close female friend"" of Mamata's former cabinet minister Partha Chatterjee, who held the education portfolio during the period of the scam.Both Chatterjee and his female associate, Arpita Mukherjee, were later arrested by the agency, besides half a dozen govt officials and other TMC functionaries. Subsequent investigation revealed that Chatterjee and his associates' made investments in luxury properties and land holding worth more than Rs 126 crore from the alleged proceeds of crime. These assets were attached by the agency.Several people were arrested in the case, including Partha Chatterjee; Arpita Mukherjee; Manik Bhattacharya, TMC MLA and ex-president of the West Bengal Board of Primary Education; Kuntal Ghosh; Santanu Banerjee; and Ayan Sil. Relatives, personal assistants and OSDs of ministers and TMC functionaries, and officials were found part of the syndicate that ""sold"" teachers jobs to ineligible candidates.During a search operation in Kolkata in Aug 2023, ED officials seized various incriminating documents and digital devices that led them to Leaps and Bounds Pvt Ltd, a company used for making dubious transactions running into crores of rupees.","The sc judgment cancelling recruitment of more than 25,000 teachers by west bengal govt is likely to spur on enforcement directorate to speed up the investigation.

"'Black badge protest, top court challenge': How DMK's M K Stalin is trying to make most of Waqf politics",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/black-badge-protest-top-court-challenge-how-dmks-m-k-stalin-is-trying-to-make-most-of-waqf-politics/articleshow/119950194.cms,"NEW DELHI: With elections in Tamil Nadu scheduled early next year, DMK president and chief minister M K Stalin has taken the lead to emerge as one of the strongest critics of the Waqf Amendment Bill - which is all set to get Parliament nod.On Thursday, Stalin came to the assembly wearing a black badge to protest against the passing of the Bill in Lok Sabha. The chief minister also announced that his government will challenge the Bill in Supreme Court.""This is an act that disturbs religious harmony. To highlight this, we are participating in today's assembly proceedings wearing black badges,"" the chief minister told the House.""I would like to inform you that the Supreme Court will be approached on behalf of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) against this controversial amendment. Tamil Nadu will fight against the Union government's law which destroys the autonomy of the Waqf Board and threatens the minority Muslim population,"" Stalin said amidst thumping of desks by the Treasury.His party member in Rajya Sabha Tiruchi Siva made a strong case against the Bill and claimed that the BJP-led NDA government was targeting the Muslims.""Why is a certain community being targeted? Govt intention is malafide and deplorable. The government says 'sabka saath, sabka vishwaas', but they have a different policy for Muslims - exclusion and marginalistaion. It is a sad day as Constitution has given rights to the Muslims, but they have been deprived of their rights. We should remember that Muslims also have contributed to the development of the country,"" T Siva said in his speech in the Upper House. Siva in his speech highlighted how the BJP governments in states like Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were targeting the Muslims.Earlier on Wednesday, when the Bill was being debated in Lok Sabha, Stalin shot off a letter to Prime Minister Modi against the legislation.""The Constitution of India grants every citizen the right to follow their respective religion and it is the duty of the elected governments to uphold and protect this right. However, the proposed amendments to the Waqf Act, 1995 have not taken into consideration the constitutional protection given to minorities and are bound to severely harm the interest of Muslim community,"" Stalin wrote in his letter.Last week, Stalin had got a resolution passed against the Bill in the state assembly on March 27. The resolution stated that the proposed Waqf legislation would seriously affect the religious harmony of India besides the minority Muslim community.Clearly, all his moves appear to be part of a well-planned political strategy to steal the initiative over his rivals in the state with assembly elections scheduled early next year.Interestingly, on all these initiatives the AIADMK , which is DMK's arch rival, has been forced to support the government.In fact, actor-politician Tamilaga Vetri Kazhagam chief Vijay, who may be the surprise factor in the upcoming assembly elections, has also dubbed the Waqf Bill ""anti-democratic"" and demanded that it be taken back.Accusing the BJP of pursuing ""majoritarian and divisive politics"", he wondered whether the Bill was not a ""psychological attack"" on Muslims and rejected the BJP-led Centre's arguments in support of the Bill.""The TVK urges that the anti-democratic Bill be immediately taken back heeding the voice of all democratic forces. In case the union government led by the BJP does not do this, the TVK will join forces with Muslim brothers and take part in their Waqf rights legal struggle,"" Vijay said.Stalin has been quick to latch on to some of the issues raised by the BJP in the state.When Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan asked the DMK government in Tamil Nadu to implement the three-language policy, Stalin turned it into an issue of state's rights alleging that it was not the National Education Policy that the BJP was trying to implement but a ""saffron policy"" aimed at developing Hindi and not the nation.Raising fears of ""Hindi imposition"" on the state, Stalin claimed that Tamil Nadu was ready for another language war. The Tamil Nadu chief minister did not stop at that.He simultaneously raised the pitch on the ""threat"" of Tamil Nadu losing Lok Sabha seats under the proposed delimitation and called an all-party meeting on the issue to ensure that the state was not penalised for ensuring development and controlling population.Muslims constitute nearly 6% of the state's population and have equally supported the DMK and the AIADMK in their pockets of influence. However, this time around Stalin perhaps wants to consolidate their support for his party. Also, perhaps there is a concerted effort by CM Stalin to make DMK a main stream player in national politics and lead opposition unity against the BJP. That was evident when Stalin brought opposition CMs and leaders from non-NDA parties in the joint action committee against the delimitation.","Dmk president and chief minister m k stalin has taken the lead to emerge as one of the strongest critics of the waqf amendment bill. On thursday, stalin came to the assembly wearing a black badge to protest against the passing of the bill in lok sabha. His party member in rajya sabha tiruchi siva claimed that the bjp-led nda government was targeting the muslims.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119951890,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-969804,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Tyeb Mehta's bull run continues: 2nd priciest Indian painting at 61.8cr,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tyeb-mehtas-bull-run-continues-2nd-priciest-indian-painting-at-61-8cr/articleshow/119957048.cms,"His work is worth crores, but Tyeb struggled most of his life

The bull run seems to be truly on in the Indian market, and who better to capture its animal spirits than Tyeb Mehta, the celebrated modernist who made the bull his enduring motif?Less than a fortnight after a work by his contemporary M F Husain joined the Rs 100-crore club, Mehta's 'Trussed Bull' (1956) went for Rs 61.8 crore ($7.27 million), becoming the second most expensive Indian painting sold at auction globally. It is now tied with Amrita Sher-Gil 's 'The Story Teller', which sold for the same price in 2023. Mehta's powerful image of a shackled and subjugated bull went for nearly nine times its higher estimate at a Saffronart auction in Mumbai on Wednesday.This is not the first time Mehta, who lived in Mumbai most of his life and passed away in 2009, has raised the bar for Indian art. In 2002, his triptych, 'Celebration', from The Times of India's collection, made history as the first modern Indian artwork to sell for over a crore (Rs 1.5 crore at Christie's).It was a Tyeb work again ('Mahishasura') which crossed the $1m mark for the first time in 2005. Now, he has set another benchmark for Indian art. Wednesday's auction was also a benchmark for homegrown auction house Saffronart, which celebrated its 25th anniversary with an auction that raked in a record-breaking $25 million. ""It's a global record for an Indian art auction. It shows the strength of the art market when other asset classes are struggling,"" said Dinesh Vazirani, Saffronart CEO and co-founder. ""It's even more meaningful because it is Mehta's centenary year.""The proceeds will go to the Mehta family since the work was from their collection. For most of his life, the artist lived in a cramped one-room apartment that was studio by day and bedroom at night. It was only in the 1990s that he and his wife Sakina could afford to move into a two-bedroom place in Lokhandwala. ""Like many other artist wives of that period, Sakina supported him. She used to work as a teacher,"" said Kishore Singh, senior VP at DAG (formerly Delhi Art Gallery).His work now goes for sums that are as jaw-dropping as his pregnant Kali and avenging yet tender Durga but to talk of Mehta purely in terms of zeroes does no justice to the man and the ideals he lived by. ""The power of painting was far more important to him than the prices it commanded,"" said Singh, narrating an anecdote from Delhi gallerist Arun Vadehra who was close to Mehta. ""Arun used to have one of his paintings hanging in his office. One day, Mehta took it away, only to replace it later with another work. When Arun asked, he said he had ripped the earlier painting because he wasn't happy with it. Tyeb may not have been very prolific but he stayed true to his art.""Mehta's strong imagery was always rooted in his life, with his canvases charting the tumult around him - the horrors of Partition, the struggles of a newly independent India and the violence of the 1992 Bombay riots. In an interview, he recounted his memories of Partition. ""At the time, I was living on Mohammed Ali Road, which was virtually a Muslim ghetto. I remember watching a young man being slaughtered in the street below my window. The crowd beat him to death, smashed his head with stones."" Those images haunted him for life, as did the sight of bullocks being led to slaughter at an abattoir in Bombay. The bull, Mehta later said, was important to him on many levels. ""The way they tie up the animal's legs and fling it on the floor of the slaughterhouse before butchering it... you feel something very vital has been lost. The trussed bull also seemed representative of the national condition... the mass of humanity unable to channel or direct its tremendous energies...""In the winter of his life, Mehta's vision was impaired. ""Those primary colours that he used so much was because his sight was affected,"" explained Singh. But he continued to paint, a perfectionist till the end.","Tyeb mehta's 'trussed bull' is the second most expensive indian painting sold at auction globally. It is now tied with amrita sher-gil's 'the story teller', which sold for the same price in 2023. The artist lived in mumbai most of his life and passed away in 2009.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119957060,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-949702,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Senior JD(U) leader Mohammed Qasim Ansari has resigned from the party and all his posts on Thursday, citing disappointment over JD(U)'s stance on the Waqf Amendment Bill 2024 .In a strongly worded resignation letter to party leader Nitish Kumar, Ansari expressed deep dismay, stating that the party’s position had shattered the faith of millions of Indian Muslims.""I am disheartened that I gave several years of my life to the party,"" his letter read.Ansari accused JD(U) of betraying its secular principles and criticised JD(U) MP Lalan Singh for the way he supported the bill in the Lok Sabha.""With due respect, I would like to state that millions of Indian Muslims like me had unwavering faith that you were a true flagbearer of secular ideology. However, that belief has now been shattered,"" he wrote.""The stance taken by the JD(U) regarding the Waqf (Amendment) Act 2024 has deeply hurt millions of dedicated Indian Muslims and party workers like us. We are extremely disheartened by the way Shri Lalan Singh presented his statement in the Lok Sabha and supported this bill with such conviction.""Calling the bill an attack on Indian Muslims and a violation of fundamental constitutional rights, Ansari argued that the legislation was also anti-Pasmanda Muslims—something he claimed neither JD(U) nor its leadership acknowledged.""The Waqf Bill is against Indian Muslims. Under no circumstances can we accept it. This bill violates several fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. Through this legislation, Indian Muslims are being humiliated and disgraced. Additionally, this bill is also anti-Pasmanda Muslims—something neither you nor your party seem to realize,"" he wrote.Regretting his long association with JD(U), Ansari said, ""I deeply regret dedicating several years of my life to this party. I am therefore submitting this letter and resigning voluntarily from the party’s primary membership and all other responsibilities.""However, when asked about Ansari, JD(U) national spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad dismissed him as a ""non-entity,"" claiming he was insignificant within the party.""Who is he? He has never been an office bearer of consequence or a prominent figure. I don't even know him. He never held any post in the party, not even at the district level. He is a non-entity,"" Prasad told PTI.Earlier to the tabling of Bill, JD(U) aligned itself with ally BJP on the Waqf Bill, though party MP Sanjay Jha clarified that JD(U) opposed any retrospective implementation of the law. He expressed hope that the government would address this concern.""Nitish Kumar has been working in Bihar for the last 19 years. During this time, the work he has done for the Muslim community is also visible. Our party had said that it should not be implemented with retrospective effect, and we hope that the government will consider it... As long as Nitish Kumar is in politics, the interests of the people will be protected,"" Jha had said days before the bill’s passage.The Lok Sabha passed the Waqf (Amendment) Bill 2025 after an extended and heated debate. While the INDIA bloc opposed the bill, BJP and its allies pushed it through. The session extended past midnight before Speaker Om Birla announced the division vote results.""Subject to correction, Ayes 288, Noes 232. The majority is in favour of the proposal,"" Birla declared.Following the Lok Sabha’s approval, Union minister of minority affairs Kiren Rijiju moved a motion in the Rajya Sabha for consideration of the Waqf (Amendment) Bill 2025 and the Musalmaan Wakf (Repeal) Bill.","Senior jd(u) leader mohammed qasim ansari has resigned from the party and all his posts.

NEW DELHI: In a blow to the Bengal govt, Supreme Court Thursday concurred with Calcutta HC's decision to cancel the 2016 recruitment of over 25,700 teachers and non-teaching staff for state govt schools, saying the selections were tainted beyond repair.Dismissing appeals of Mamata govt, West Bengal School Services Commission and 125 successful candidates, a bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar said, ""The entire selection process has been vitiated and tainted beyond resolution.""Writing the 41-page judgement that rejected pleas for segregating tainted candidates instead of cancelling the entire recruitment, CJI Khanna said, ""Manipulations and frauds on a large scale, coupled with attempted cover-up, have dented the process... (Its) credibility and legitimacy are denuded."" Referring to destruction of candidates' OMR (answer) sheets purportedly for illegal rank jumping, selection of those who didn't qualify and even those who gave blank answer papers, the bench said HC had on April 22 last year rightly cancelled the entire process.SC said tainted candidates, who were appointed as teachers or to non-teaching staff posts, ""should be required to refund any salaries/payments received. Since their appointments were the result of fraud, this amounts to cheating"". However, it said even though non-tainted candidates would lose jobs, they won't be asked to refund salaries and reimbursements they received.In another important clarification, SC said the selected candidates, who do not fall in the tainted category and may have worked in govt departments prior to their selection to teaching and non-teaching jobs, ""will have the right to apply to their previous departments or autonomous bodies to continue in their service with those entities"". The bench said, ""Their seniority and other entitlements will be preserved, and they will be eligible for increments. However, for the period they were employed under the disputed appointment, no wages will be paid by the state or autonomous bodies. If needed supernumerary posts would be created to accommodate them.""SC will on April 8 hear the petition filed by state govt challenging the HC direction for a CBI probe against officials and ministers who decided to create supernumerary posts for teachers and non-teaching staff, and appoint more people than those who had made it to the list of selected candidates.","'untainted' can seek return to previous jobs in govt depts: sc.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday rejected the Waqf Amendment Bill , which was passed in the Lok Sabha with 288 votes in favour, and claimed that once the BJP-led regime was ousted, they would nullify the law.The controversial bill passed in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday after a marathon 12-hour debate, securing 288 votes in favor and 232 against.

INDIA bloc parties alleged that the bill was ""unconstitutional"" and aimed at targeting Muslims. Congress , TMC, DMK, AAP, Shiv Sena (UBT), Samajwadi Party, RJD and Left parties questioned the govt's intent behind bringing the legislation.Leader of the House and BJP president J P Nadda pointed out that other Muslim-dominated countries, including Turkiye, Malaysia, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Iran had changed their laws for better management of waqf properties. ""When these Muslim nations are digitising waqf properties and making them accountable, then what is the problem if it is being done in India?"" he said, adding that with the amendments, the govt has tried to ensure that waqf properties are in the right hands and used for the benefit of Muslims.Nadda said Muslim women became second-grade citizens during UPA's term. ""It was only India where Muslim women were not brought into the mainstream,"" he said, adding that triple talaq was banned in Muslim countries such as Egypt, Sudan, Bangladesh and Syria several years ago. ""We believe in real service, not lip service. Today crores of Muslim sisters have the right to live with dignity. Who did it? It is a historic decision and none other than PM Modi has done it,"" Nadda said.Nominated BJP MP Ghulam Ali supported the bill and said there was an urgent need for this legislation as a certain family was usurping Muslims' land. He called for a CBI inquiry into the misuse of waqf board and waqf properties.Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge accused the govt of trying to sow the seeds of conflict by suppressing Muslims through the legislation and appealed to BJP not to disturb peace and harmony in the country. ""This is against Muslims, not constitutional, and don't try to stoke disturbances in the peaceful fabric of society,"" he said.Rijiju countered the allegations and said, ""Many people said this is unconstitutional, illegal and the right of Muslims is being snatched away.
