BHOPAL: Congress removed Saturday 68 district presidents in Madhya Pradesh, appointing 71 new chiefs that include six sitting MLAs and eight former legislators.

All three are considered close to state Congress chief Jitu Patwari.Patwari said the appointments would strengthen the party against BJP, describing district chiefs as the ""backbone of the organisation"". He said: ""Under the guidance of Congress top leadership, the organisation rejuvenation campaign has now reached the stage of responsibilities within the party."" Congress claimed 70% of the new chiefs have experience in Youth Congress, NSUI or Seva Dal, with the team's average age between 45 and 50.Political observers, however, said senior functionaries Digvijaya Singh, Kamal Nath, Patwari and former PCC chief Arun Yadav ensured their supporters found place.Appointments allegedly reflect factional balance: Digvijaya loyalists Jaivardhan Singh, Priyavrat Singh and Vipin Wankhede; Kamal Nath loyalists Vishwanath Okhte, Saurabh Nati Sharma and Ravi Naik; Patwari's backers formed about 20% of the list, while Arun Yadav's supporters gained some slots in Nimar.Party insiders said district presidents will have authority to recommend candidates for the 2028 assembly elections.

"Health in mind, Punjab village bans energy drinks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/health-in-mind-punjab-village-bans-energy-drinks/articleshow/123341344.cms,"SANGRUR: A village panchayat in Punjab's Sagrur district has banned energy drinks as part of a broader campaign to protect the health of its youth, reports Bharat Khanna.The 10-member panchayat of Uppali village includes four women. The panchs are aged between 30 and 42 years. Some have studied only up to matriculation, while some are graduates. The decision was taken unanimously, said sarpanch Jangir Singh.The panchayat has adopted a resolution that anyone who violates the ban will face social boycott. Shopkeepers have pledged their support. Large banners announcing the ban have been put up at every entry point of the village. Jangir Singh explained that the move began with a simple appeal to shopkeepers. ""Initially, we started by requesting shopkeepers to stop selling energy drinks. At first, some expressed concern about losses, but they soon agreed, recognising the larger benefit for children's health,"" he said.The trigger for the ban was the realisation that many drug addicts were mixing narcotics with energy drinks, said Singh. The small community was alarmed. ""Moreover, doctors have been warning about the ill-effects of these drinks on children.They were being sold in large quantities,"" added the sarpanch.Beyond energy drinks, the panchayat passed several other strict resolutions. No one caught selling or consuming drugs in the village will receive community support for bail or release. Medical shops have been directed not to sell syringes without valid authorisation, and violators will face legal action.","The 10-member panchayat of uppali village includes four women.

‘Important to timely counter misinformation drive that has reached absurd level’

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission (EC) will hold a press conference here on Sunday to put across a “point-by-point counter” to what it calls misinformation being spread by a few opposition parties regarding the past and ongoing revision of electoral roll in certain states, sources in the poll panel told TOI.The event coincides with the start of Congress MP Rahul Gandhi’s ‘voter adhikar yatra’ that will see him amplifying his allegations of roll imperfections across Bihar.EC and the state chief electoral officers concerned have repeatedly countered allegations of ‘vote chori’ — levelled by Rahul at a press conference on Aug 7 and echoed by many opposition parties — through a series of ‘fact-check’ posts on social media. But this is the first time that Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar and election commissioners S S Sandhu and Vivek Joshi will directly rebut what EC sources termed “misinformation” and “lies” being spread by parties that are “involved at each stage of preparation of the roll” and “get appropriate time and opportunity to rectify errors both before and after publication of the electoral roll”.EC sources pointed out that though the allegations of voter roll discrepancies were raised by Rahul Gandhi more than a year after the relevant elections in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Haryana, the CEOs concerned had offered to probe them, provided he, as required by the law, furnished a signed declaration affirming the claimed errors to be true.The Congress MP has declined to submit an affidavit.“It is, thus, important to timely counter the misinformation campaign that has now reached absurd levels with the use of artificial intelligencegenerated content to mislead the people and shake voter confidence in the electoral system,” a functionary told TOI.EC reiterated Saturday the election system for parliamentary and assembly poll is a multi-layered, decentralised construct as per law, with sub division magistrate (SDM)- level officers doubling as electoral registration officers (EROs), to prepare and finalise the roll with the help of booth level officers (BLOs). EROs and BLOs take responsibility for correctness of the roll.After publication of the draft electoral roll, its digital and physical copies are shared with all political parties and put on ECI website.Electors and parties can file claims and objections for one month before the final roll is published. Even after this, two-tiered appeals may be filed, first with DM and then with CEO. “It seems some political parties and their booth level agents did not examine the electoral rolls at the appropriate time (during claims and objections and then, the appeal period) and did not point out errors, if any, to SDMs/EROs, DEOs or CEOs,” EC said, adding if done at the “right time through the right channels, it would have enabled the SDM/ERO to correct the mistakes, if genuine, before those elections”.",The event coincides with the start of congress mp rahul gandhi’s ‘voter adhikar yatra’ that will see him amplifying his allegations of roll imperfections across bihar.

NEW DELHI/SASARAM: With Bihar gearing up for assembly polls, leader of opposition in LS Rahul Gandhi is all set to launch the 'Vote Adhikar Yatra' from Sasaram in Rohtas district Sunday to highlight the alleged assault on people's voting rights through the special intensive revision (SIR) of the state's electoral rolls and to make the battle against ""vote theft"" a mass movement.Rahul will be joined in the yatra, spread over 16 days, by members of INDIA bloc parties that are part of the ""mahagathbandhan"" in Bihar, such as RJD's Tejashwi Yadav. The yatra will culminate with a show of strength at a rally at Patna's Gandhi Maidan on Sept 1.On Saturday, Rahul on X said, ""Sixteen days, 20-plus districts, 1,300-plus kilometres. We are coming among the people with voter rights yatra. This is the right to protect the most fundamental democratic right - 'one person, one vote'. Join us in Bihar to save the Constitution.""Addressing a press conference in Delhi about the yatra - that starts from south Bihar's Sasaram parliamentary constituency which is seen as a Congress stronghold - party spokesperson Pawan Khera said the yatra will travel across districts to cover the state and there will be three break days - Aug 20, 25 and 31. Besides Tejashwi, other INDIA bloc partners, which include three Left parties, will also be part of the yatra, he said.CPI (ML) Liberation confirmed to TOI that its general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya, along with Karakat MP Raja Ram will be joining Rahul. CPM functionary Subashini Ali will also be part of the yatra. CPI is also part of the INDIA bloc.Khera alleged that SIR had actually exposed the designs of BJP to disenfranchise lakhs of voters, including Dalits, adivasis, minorities, the poor people and the daily wage labourers.He said thanks to the people of Bihar, activists, and Congress and INDIA bloc workers who raised their voice against SIR, the Election Commission has been forced to do the course correction. Khera said, it was only after Supreme Court's intervention that the EC was compelled to address the concerns of the common people and voters.Khera said the aim of the Yatra was to ensure awareness and alertness among the people so that the Modi govt does not continue with its conspiracy to deny voting rights to the people of Bihar.","Rahul will be joined in the yatra, spread over 16 days, by members of india bloc parties that are part of the ""mahagathbandhan"" in bihar.
