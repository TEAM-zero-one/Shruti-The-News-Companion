Ahmedabad London Flight Crash: 3 photos that tell the full horror of Ahmedabad-London Air India flight AI-171’s final moments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/in-34-seconds-3-photos-that-tell-the-full-horror-of-ahmedabad-london-air-india-flight-ai-171s-final-moments/articleshow/121817176.cms,"A London-bound Air India Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, killing at least 245 people, including former Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani. The Boeing 787-8, carrying 242 passengers and crew, failed to gain altitude, impacting near the airport.

Flight AI-171 seen moments after lifting off from Ahmedabad airport, flying unusually low with its landing gear still deployed — the aircraft appears to struggle for altitude just 425 feet above the ground before vanishing behind buildings near Meghaninagar.

Vijay Rupani’s Chilling Last Visuals from Doomed Air India Flight AI171 | WATCH

A massive explosion engulfs the BJ Medical College hostel building as the Dreamliner crashes into the doctors’ mess, triggering a fireball and dense black smoke that rose above the Meghaninagar skyline. Eyewitnesses described the sound as “like a bomb going off”.

The mangled remains of Air India’s 787-8 Dreamliner sprawled across the residential block and mess hall — its tail section wedged into the rooftop and debris scattered across half a kilometre. The scale of destruction left little hope for survivors.

NEW DELHI: In just 34 seconds, a routine takeoff turned into India’s deadliest single-aircraft crash. And in those same 34 seconds, three images, now etched into the nation’s memory, captured the full descent into horror.The first photo shows Air India’s London-bound Dreamliner moments after it lifts off from Runway 23 of Ahmedabad airport at 1.39pm. The aircraft, an 11-year-old Boeing 787-8, appears unusually low, barely clearing the airport perimeter. Its landing gear is still down. It isn’t climbing — it’s gliding flat, almost hesitantly, as if fighting an invisible drag. Flaps aren’t visibly engaged. For a wide-body aircraft carrying over 240 people, the trajectory looks disturbingly unnatural.The second frame freezes the exact moment of impact. The aircraft, having lost altitude rapidly, tears into the BJ Medical College hostel mess in Meghaninagar. The image captures a deafening blast — an orange-white fireball erupting from the ground, hurling metal, glass, and flame into the sky. Black smoke begins to rise instantly. Eyewitnesses said they heard the plane coming in too low.The third photo is aftermath.Nothing resembling an aircraft remains. The fuselage has splintered; debris strewn across the hostel quarters and adjacent lanes. A section of the empennage — the aircraft’s tail — hangs grotesquely from the roof of the mess building. The landing gear is embedded in a nearby wall. The crash site, just 3km from the end of the runway, looks like a war zone.AI-171, with 242 passengers and crew onboard, had taken off late — and didn’t get far. Captain Sumeet Sabharwal’s calm “Mayday” call to Ahmedabad ATC was the last transmission. After climbing to just 425 feet, the plane nosedived, leaving little time for response, and no chance for recovery.The crash killed at least 245 people, including former Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani and several doctors and residents on the college campus. One man, seated in 11A — a UK national of Indian origin — survived and walked out of the burning fuselage. The death toll is expected to rise, with nearly 290 body bags in use by rescue teams.Initial probes point to a double engine failure, possibly due to bird strike — though investigators have not ruled out technical or procedural lapses. This was the first crash involving a Boeing 787 Dreamliner since its launch. The aircraft had logged over 41,000 flight hours, with 8,000 takeoffs and landings in the past year alone.The Tata Group has announced ₹1 crore compensation for each victim’s family and has pledged support to rebuild the BJ Medical College hostel.As firefighters, NDRF teams, and hospital staff sifted through the charred remains, the three photos — frozen moments from a tragedy — told the full story in a way words never could.","London-bound air india dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff from ahmedabad, killing at least 245 people, including former gujarat cm vijay rupani.

Meghalaya Murder: ‘Kamakhya visit before consummation of marriage’: Cops say Sonam used temple ruse to lure husband Raja Raghuvanshi to northeast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/kamakhya-visit-before-consummation-of-marriage-cops-say-sonam-used-temple-ruse-to-lure-husband-raja-raghuvanshi-to-northeast/articleshow/121793341.cms,"Raja Raghuvanshi from Indore was killed during his honeymoon in Meghalaya. His wife, Sonam, allegedly planned the murder with her boyfriend, Raj Kushwaha. They hired three contract killers.

Poll Should there be stricter laws for preventing domestic violence and murder? Yes, definitely. No, current laws are sufficient.

NEW DELHI: Raja Raghuvanshi, the Indore-based businessman murdered during his honeymoon in Meghalaya, had been convinced by his wife Sonam to delay consummating the marriage until after a ritual offering at the Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati — a ruse investigators now say was part of a sinister plot to lure him to the Northeast and have him killed in a remote location.“Sonam told Raja that they should first visit the Kamakhya Devi Temple and offer prayers before consummating the marriage,” a senior investigating officer told PTI on Wednesday.The couple got married in Indore on May 11 and travelled to the Northeast on May 20, reaching Meghalaya via Guwahati. They checked out of a homestay in Nongriat village on May 23 and then disappeared — prompting Raja’s family to raise an alert. Ten days later, on June 2, Raja’s body was found in a gorge near Weisawdong Falls in Sohra.The case has since unravelled as a premeditated murder allegedly orchestrated by Sonam in connivance with her boyfriend Raj Kushwaha and three hired contract killers. Sonam, who initially went missing after the murder, resurfaced in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh, and surrendered on June 9. Her boyfriend and the three hitmen — Vishal Singh Chauhan, Akash Rajput, and Anand Kurmi — were arrested soon after.According to investigators, Sonam pushed for the trip to Nongriat — a remote jungle area accessible only by trekking — hoping the murder would be easier to execute there. But the plan was delayed due to heavy tourist presence on May 22 and 23.“They ultimately killed Raja near Weisawdong Falls and dumped his body into a gorge,” said the officer.East Khasi Hills SP Vivek Syiem, who is leading the investigation, said the contract killers arrived in Guwahati on May 21, a day after the couple reached the Northeast. They bought a machete near their hotel before heading to Shillong by road.“Sonam stayed in touch with Raj throughout the day of the murder, while Raj coordinated with the three killers. She was present at the spot when Raja was killed,” said SP Syiem.After the murder, Sonam fled from Mawkdok to Shillong in a local taxi, then hired a tourist cab to Guwahati, from where she boarded multiple trains to avoid detection.“While she claims to have returned to Indore directly, we are still verifying this route,” the officer added.The Meghalaya Police SIT is now piecing together the full timeline of events and has already gathered CCTV evidence and mobile data to support the investigation.“We are also verifying Sonam’s claim that she had never been to Meghalaya before. The SIT is committed to filing a watertight chargesheet,” an officer said.All five accused — Sonam, Raj Kushwaha, and the three contract killers — have been produced before a court in Shillong and remain in police custody.","Raja raghuvanshi from indore was killed during his honeymoon in meghalaya.

GUWAHATI: The Assam government on Friday issued a shoot-at-sight order in the India-Bangladesh border town of Dhubri after dusk to rein in what CM Himanta Biswa Sarma described as ""a communal group"" fomenting trouble over the past week.The immediate trigger for the directive to enforcement agencies, including Rapid Action Force and CRPF reinforcements, was a purported poster campaign by the group for ""Dhubri's integration with Bangladesh"".The town has been on the edge for several days following mob violence over offal being found near a place of worship.CM, who was in Dhubri district to take stock, said police found at least three provocative posters put up by a group identified as Nabin Bangla at different locations there.""Since the last one week, maintaining law and order in Dhubri has been challenging.

A major fire broke out on Saturday at the 67-storey Marina Pinnacle building in Dubai Marina, prompting a large-scale emergency response and the safe evacuation of all 3,820 residents from 764 apartments. Authorities confirmed there were no injuries.The fire, which was extinguished after nearly six hours of effort, drew swift intervention from Dubai Civil Defence teams, who worked through the night to contain the blaze. In a series of updates on X, the Dubai Media Office (DMO) said: “Specialised teams successfully evacuated all residents… prioritising their health and safety throughout the operation.”Medical and psychological support teams were on-site to assist residents. “Ambulance teams and medical staff are on site to offer full medical and mental support to the safely evacuated residents,” DMO posted at 2:09 am.Authorities also assured that temporary housing arrangements were being made in coordination with the building’s developer to ensure the affected residents' well-being.As firefighting operations continued, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) suspended tram services between Dubai Marina Station (No.5) and Palm Jumeirah Station (No. 9) as a precautionary measure. A replacement shuttle bus service was activated, with the RTA stating, “The safety of our passengers and operations is our top priority.”Tram services will resume only after full safety inspections are conducted, the authority added.Eyewitnesses described the situation as tense, with one resident noting: “At around 1:30am, the fire started to slow down… plenty of debris has been falling.”Thanks to swift action, no surrounding buildings were affected. Authorities are now monitoring the structure and will conduct a thorough investigation to determine the cause of the fire, which remains undisclosed.This is not the first fire reported at Marina Pinnacle — also known as Tiger Tower. In May 2015, a kitchen fire on the 47th floor had spread to the floor above before being contained.Despite the building's fire history, Saturday’s operation stands out for its scale, coordination, and zero casualty outcome — underscoring Dubai’s emergency preparedness.","A major fire broke out on saturday at the 67-storey marina pinnacle building in dubai marina, prompting a large-scale emergency response.

The US State Department has issued a Level 2 travel advisory for the Dominican Republic, warning American tourists to exercise increased caution amid a rise in violent crime, including robberies, sexual assaults, and homicides.The updated advisory, released Thursday, marks the second such notice in less than a year for the popular Caribbean destination. A Level 2 alert is the second-lowest in the State Department’s four-tier system but still signals elevated risk, particularly in urban areas frequented by tourists.Citing a troubling uptick in violent incidents, the advisory urges travellers to be vigilant and adopt a series of safety precautions: remain aware of surroundings, avoid displaying valuables, use phones discreetly, travel in groups, and refrain from leaving food or drinks unattended. In the event of a robbery, tourists are advised not to resist and to comply with demands.“If you are the victim of a crime,” the advisory says, “you can contact the local 911 service, tourist police (POLITUR), or resort security.” However, it also cautions that perpetrators are “rarely caught and prosecuted.”The Dominican Republic remains a popular getaway for American travellers, but officials stress that increased vigilance is essential as law enforcement struggles to curb crime.(This is a top Google Trends topic)",The us state department has issued a level 2 travel advisory for the dominican republic.

Kylie Kelce’s honest talk with her mom about sex before marriage will leave you stunned



Kylie on Bikini Runway Walks, Carnivore Diet & Father’s Day Gifts For Mom with Ilona Maher | Ep. 22





Kylie Kelce is no stranger to real, unfiltered conversations, especially when it comes to family. In the latest episode of her Not Gonna Lie podcast, aired June 12, the mom of four opened up about a deeply personal memory that revealed the bond she shares with her mother, Lisa McDevitt — whom she lovingly refers to as “Lil’ Lis. ”Joining forces with Olympic rugby player Ilona Maher, the episode unfolded into an honest discussion about how their mothers influenced their understanding of sex and communication. For Kylie Kelce, this comfort was rooted in openness from an early age. Recounting a moment that clearly stuck with her, she said, ""I bombarded her, and came in and sat in a room while she was doing something, and just was like, 'OK, Mom, here. We're here now.'""At the time, Kelce had made up her mind to wait until marriage to have sex. But her mother’s response was anything but conventional. ""I think I'm gonna save myself for marriage,"" she told her mom. The reply? ""I think you're gonna change your mind."" And that wasn’t even the punchline.Kelce laughed as she remembered her mom’s brutally honest follow-up. ""Lil' Lisa doubled down... She was like, 'Hey, you gotta test drive a car before you buy it, right?'""While the original plan didn’t pan out, Kelce said the point wasn’t about the decision itself — it was the freedom she felt in making it.“It made it less scary. It made it less risky,” she said, adding that being able to speak openly with her mom gave her a safer, more informed perspective on sex and relationships.Now a mother to four daughters — Wyatt (5), Elliotte (4), Bennett (2), and baby Finnley, born in March — Kylie hopes to build the same trusting dynamic with her own girls. She believes that kind of environment allows for real conversations about protection and safety. “With my mom, then I could talk about getting an IUD, I could talk about condoms and all that stuff with her,” she explained.Beyond the sex talk, Kelce also let fans into the chaos of raising four young kids. She joked, “If I had to describe the change going from three kids to four kids in two words or less: ‘Holy shit?’” Despite being a seasoned mom, she admitted she’s “still Googling things because that doesn’t stop, either.”For Kelce, authenticity and humor are part of the journey. Whether she’s parenting or podcasting, one thing is clear — the candid legacy of “Lil’ Lis” lives on.Also Read: Ex-girlfriend of Aaron Rodgers reacts after he confirms secret marriage: ""It's really just harassment""","Kylie kelce once told her mom she was waiting until marriage for sex.

Why Venice locals are protesting against Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez Wedding venue

Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding, set for June 24 in Venice, is facing a fierce backlash from local residents and activists. Demonstrators have unfurled banners across historic churches, including the San Giorgio Maggiore Church, with slogans like “No Space for Bezos”, signaling their frustration over the lavish event. The $10 million celebration, planned on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, has triggered protests over blocked streets, luxury hotel takeovers, and environmental concerns, threatening to disrupt the Floating City during its peak tourist season.One of the most striking acts of dissent saw a large banner unfurled from the bell tower of the historic San Giorgio Maggiore Church. The banner, featuring a bold red 'X' slashing through Bezos's name, sent a clear visual message across the lagoon, quickly garnering attention on social media platforms. Flyers with similar slogans, including ""No space for oligarchs, no space for Bezos,"" have also been plastered across the city.The protests stem from concerns that Bezos’ wedding, scheduled for June 24-26, is turning Venice into a “playground for the ultra-wealthy”, exacerbating issues of overtourism, restricted public access, and environmental strain. Activists claim that Bezos has reserved luxury hotels, water taxis, and even an entire island, limiting movement for locals during peak tourist season.Local activist group Laboratorio Occupato Morion , which describes itself as an ""anti-fascist, anti-capitalist, anti-racist, and trans-feminist political space,"" is leading the charge against the event. Alice Bazzoli, a spokesperson for the Laboratorio Occupato Morion, a local activist group, stated: ""Bezos thinks he can buy the entire city. We refuse to let Venice be held hostage by one of the richest men in the world.""Organisers emphasise that their actions are not a personal attack on Bezos and Sanchez, but rather a broader statement against the disruptive nature of such events in a city already grappling with immense pressure.The couple is likely to host their guests at Scuola Grande della Misericordia. Built in 1310, the historical building was originally one of Venice’s Seven Scuole Grandi, a site reserved for city’s elite. The venue consists of grand frescoes by Renaissance masters such as Tintoretto, Veronese, and Pellegrini, making it one of the most opulent locations in the city. The building, which has been repurposed for exhibitions and events, can accommodate up to 1,000 guests.The wedding, scheduled for the weekend of June 24, is expected to host Hollywood stars, business moguls, and political figures. Among the rumored guests are Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, and Eva Longoria.","Jeff bezos and lauren sanchez's wedding is facing a fierce backlash from local residents and activists.
