NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation on Wednesday conducted searches at the residence of former Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel.According to officials, the investigating agency raided Baghel's residences in Raipur and Bhilai, as well as the residential premises of a senior police officer and a close associate of the former chief minister.Reacting to the raids, Baghel suggested that the actions were taken to prevent him from attending a key Congress meeting scheduled for April 8 and 9 in Ahmedabad.Taking to X, Baghel said, ""Now the CBI has arrived. Today, former Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel is scheduled to travel to Delhi for a meeting of the 'Drafting Committee' formed for the AICC meeting to be held in Ahmedabad (Gujarat) on the upcoming 8th and 9th of April.""""Even before that, the CBI has already reached his residences in Raipur and Bhilai,"" he added.This comes days after the Enforcement Directorate raided Baghel's residence in connection with an alleged liquor scam.The central investigating agency seized approximately Rs 30 lakh in cash, using a counting machine, at the former chief minister’s residence.The probe was linked to an alleged liquor scam that the central agency believes caused a ""massive loss"" to the state exchequer. Authorities claim that those involved in the liquor syndicate had siphoned off around Rs 2,161 crore through various schemes.The ED investigation so far has revealed that the liquor syndicate operated between 2019 and 2022, generating a large amount of illegal commissions through multiple methods. One of the ways was to collect bribes from the distillers for each liquor 'case' procured by the state liquor body.The alleged scam also involved the sale of country liquor from state-run shops, which remained entirely unaccounted for. The ED believes that not a single rupee reached the state exchequer, with all the money pocketed by the syndicate suspects.","The central bureau of investigation raided the residences of former chhattisgarh chief minister bhupesh baghel.

The current Congress leadership, including party chief Mallikarjun Kharge, should answer if it was no violation of oath by Rajiv, he said at a press conference.He alleged that Quattrocchi’s bank accounts were defrozen by CBI in 2005 during Congress-led UPA rule at the behest of Sonia. “Sonia and Rahul should resign from their position till they make a full disclosure about their family’s relations with Quattrocchi.

PM set to open new bridge to Rameswaram on Ram Navami,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-set-to-open-new-bridge-to-rameswaram-on-ram-navami/articleshow/119509551.cms,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to inaugurate the new Pamban bridge in Tamil Nadu on Ram Navami (April 6), which will improve rail connectivity to Rameswaram - one of the holiest Hindu pilgrimage sites.Rameswaram is believed to be the place where Lord Ram built the bridge to Lanka, as recounted in the Ramayana, to defeat Ravan. Over 25 lakh pilgrims visit the Rameswaram temple annually and the upgraded infrastructure is expected to be a bigger boost to tourism and pilgrimage.As far as symbolisms go, the significance of the likelihood of PM inaugurating the bridge on the day of Ram Navami, the day when Hindus believe Lord Ram was born, is big enough. But what makes it even more interesting is the timing of the likely inauguration-when DMK govt in Tamil Nadu has virtually been on a warpath against Centre over the language issue and yet-to-be announced delimination.The new bridge, country's first vertical sea bridge, is expected to ensure greater comfort for travellers.Sources said the preparation for commercial opening of the sea bridge is in full swing and top railway officials from Southern Railway have been inspecting the bridge and the Rameswaram railway station in the past few days. The inauguration is likely soon after the PM returns from his two-day trip (April 4 and 5) to Sri Lanka, they added.The little over 2-km rail bridge is an engineering marvel that reconnects the mainland to Rameswaram Island, replacing the old corroded bridge. The old bridge constructed in 1914 was the only link between Rameswaram and the mainland, and was a cultural icon for over 110 years. This was the country's first sea bridge and was a lifeline for locals, pilgrims, and traders. Exposure to saltwater and aging infrastructure caused severe corrosion, which eventually led to its closure in 2022.Officials said the new one isn't just a replacement, but a more modern and efficient one as it can accommodate growing traffic volumes, ensure durability and facilitate maritime navigation.

The official added that drone-based transport can help bridge the gap between donor sites and recipients, ensuring that no viable tissue goes unused and that more patients regain sight in time.Over the past few years, ICMR ’s i-DRONE initiative has demonstrated the successful use of drones to deliver essential medical supplies in states in different regions across country.",The indian council of medical research carried out a feasibility study to assess the potential of using drones to transport sensitive biomaterials such as human corneas.

FIR filed against Kamra



'I will not apologise'



Political leaders react



Another video by Kamra in response



Sanjay Raut defends Kamra



'Freedom of expression has limits': Shinde



More allegations and threats against Kamra



NEW DELHI: A stand-up comedy performance by Kunal Kamra ignited a political storm in Maharashtra, leading to violent protests, legal action, and heated exchanges among political leaders. His latest show, which was released online on Sunday, included sharp jabs at Maharashtra deputy CM Eknath Shinde , provoking outrage among the Shinde-led faction of Shiv Sena Kamra’s sharp political commentary included a parody of a popular Hindi song from 'Dil Toh Pagal Hai', in which he referred to Shinde as a ""gaddar"" (traitor). His jokes also touched upon recent political turmoil in Maharashtra, including the splits between Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).The performance provoked an immediate reaction from Shinde’s Shiv Sena faction. Party workers stormed the Unicontinental Hotel’s Habitat Comedy Club Studio on Monday, ransacking the venue in protest against Kamra’s remarks.The police responded, arresting Shiv Sena functionary Rahul Kanal and 11 others for the attack. However, a magistrate’s court granted them bail the same day.Amid the uproar, an FIR was registered against Kamra in Thane district for allegedly defaming Eknath Shinde. The case, filed at Dombivli police station by a Shiv Sena functionary, charges Kamra under Section 356(2) (defamation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.Despite the backlash, Kamra remained defiant. He issued a strong response on the same day as the vandalism, refusing to apologize. ""I will not apologise,"" he clarified in a post on X, taking aim at both the ""mob and politicians"" who were outraged by his jokes.The row quickly rocketed into a political slugfest, with leaders from different parties weighing in. Maharashtra minister of state for home Yogesh Ramdas Kadam condemned Kamra’s comments, warning of consequences.""He will be punished. If you are going to insult the Supreme Court, PM of India, Hindu Gods and Goddesses, it is not tolerable. You cannot behave like this in Maharashtra or India... We do enjoy comedy, but this is not the kind of comedy that will be tolerated in Maharashtra,"" Kadam said.Kamra, in turn, responded with another satirical video on Tuesday, mocking the Shiv Sena workers who vandalised the comedy club. He posted a clip of himself singing ""Hum Honge Kangaal"", interspersed with footage of the destruction caused by party workers.Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut came out strongly in support of Kamra, arguing that the comedian would not bow to pressure.""I know Kamra. We share the same DNA. He is a fighter,"" Raut told reporters. ""He won’t apologize. If you have to act against him, you have to take recourse to lawful steps.""His comments provoked a sharp reaction from Maharashtra Minister Yogesh Kadam, who retorted, ""The DNA of Kamra and Raut could be the same. He (Kamra) is mad, and so is this person (Raut).""BJP MLC Parinay Phuke also weighed in, alleging that Kamra was being supported by opposition parties. ""The Congress or other parties are supporting Kamra. Their DNA must be the same because the DNA of scoundrels is the same,"" he said.Eknath Shinde himself responded to the controversy, defending freedom of expression but warning against its misuse.""Right to express is important in a democracy, but to say anything in the guise of it and on the instruction of somebody is wrong,"" he said. ""He said many things about PM Modi, CJI, FM Sitharaman, HM Shah. He has been saying such things. Many airlines have banned him. Who is behind him? I don’t worry, there have been many allegations against him. I don’t support the vandalism of the studio—that was due to the emotions of the party workers. This looks like a well-thought-out conspiracy.""Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath, in an exclusive interview with ANI, addressed the issue, saying, ""Freedom of expression should not be misused as a tool for attacks. Unfortunately, some people treat free speech as their inherent right to create divisions and further polarise the country.""Adding to the row, Shiv Sena MP Naresh Mhaske alleged on Tuesday that Kamra had been paid to make such statements as part of a conspiracy to divert attention from the Disha Salian case .""It does not matter whether Kunal Kamra apologises or not, he has talked about our leader, our worker will give him 'prasad', it does not matter whether is sweet or bitter, he will himself tell about that. He will get the reaction of Shiv Sena,"" he said.""Kunal Kamra has been given money to make such statements to divert people's attention away from Disha Salian’s case. Uddhav Thackeray and Sanjay Raut are left with no workers, which is why they are putting forward people like Kunal Kamra,"" Mhaske told ANI.He also issued a veiled threat, warning that Kamra would not be able to move around freely in Maharashtra.""He will face the reaction as Shiv Sena is a party of reaction. We are Shiv Sainiks, and if someone talks rubbish about our leader, we will not tolerate that. We are ready to face all the consequences, but Kunal Kamra cannot roam freely in Maharashtra and India,"" Mhaske said.","Kunal kamra's latest show included sharp jabs at maharashtra deputy cm eknath shinde.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara on Tuesday said the state government will determine the course of action and type of probe into the alleged ""honeytrap"" attempt on cooperation minister K N Rajanna after consulting legal experts and chief minister Siddaramaiah.The statement followed Rajanna’s formal request for action, in which he described encountering unfamiliar individuals and raised concerns about whether they acted independently or had external backing.The decision came hours after Parameshwara told reporters in Bengaluru that Rajanna had yet to file a complaint on the matter.""I will file a complaint today and submit it to the home minister because I had spoken about it in the Assembly and had said I would do so. Until today, I was unable to write the complaint due to various work-related commitments,"" Rajanna said.Speaking to reporters, he added, ""I have personally written the complaint and will submit it to the home minister today. I'm getting it typed... I will go wherever the home minister is and hand it over. I have detailed everything that happened in a three-page complaint.""Initially dismissing the issue as a common occurrence, Rajanna said he took it seriously after his name was mentioned in the Assembly.""I have not installed CCTV cameras in my Bengaluru house. If they were there, we could have identified who came and went,"" he said.He mentioned that the individuals involved were strangers and stressed the need to investigate whether they acted alone or had backing.Among those who allegedly attempted to ""honeytrap"" him, Rajanna said the same man appeared both times, but the woman accompanying him was different on each occasion.""The woman who came the second time claimed to be a high court lawyer. However, she was not wearing a lawyer's coat but was dressed in jeans and a blue top. They approached me, stating they had something important and confidential to discuss. I can recognise them if I see their photos,"" he said.Last Thursday, Rajanna had informed the Assembly that honeytrap attempts were made on him and that at least 48 politicians across parties had fallen victim to such schemes.The revelation sparked a stir in the Assembly, prompting the home minister to announce a high-level probe while the opposition demanded a judicial inquiry by a sitting high court judge.Reacting to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed in the Supreme Court, Rajanna dismissed claims that he had mentioned judges in his statements.""Have I said anything about judges? I haven't. I only said that such attempts have been made on political leaders from all parties by their opponents to settle political scores. I never mentioned judges. Yet, someone has filed a PIL claiming that I did and that the case should be handed over to the CBI,"" he said, calling the petition misleading and based on ""false information.""Asked about his travel plans, Rajanna said he would visit Delhi after March 30.When questioned about informing the Congress high command, he replied, ""The matter has already reached the high command. They have not asked me anything personally, so I haven't spoken to them. However, they have gathered information on their own and have spoken to the chief minister about it.""Addressing concerns about discussing the issue in the Assembly, Rajanna admitted he should have brought it up within the cabinet or party first but felt compelled to speak after BJP MLA Basangouda Patil Yatnal mentioned his name while referring to alleged ""honey trapping"" attempts.","Karnataka home minister g parameshwara said the state government will determine the course of action and type of probe into the alleged ""honeytrap"" attempt on cooperation minister k n rajanna.

NEW DELHI: A day after refusing to hear a plea challenging the Allahabad high court ’s ruling, which stated that ""grabbing a minor girl 's breasts, breaking her pyjama strings did not amount to rape or an attempt to rape,"" the Supreme Court on Tuesday took cognisance of the ruling on its own.A bench of Justices B R Gavai and Augustine George Masih is slated to hear the matter on Wednesday.Earlier, a bench comprising Justices Bela Trivedi and Prasanna B Varale dismissed the petition, stating that the court was not inclined to entertain it.The high court ruling came on a case involving two men, Pawan and Akash, who allegedly grabbed the minor’s breasts, tore her pyjama string, and attempted to drag her under a culvert while she was walking with her mother. Initially, they were charged under Section 376 of the IPC (rape) and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.However, the Allahabad HC ruled that their actions did not qualify as rape or an attempt to rape but instead fell under the lesser charge of aggravated sexual assault , punishable under Section 354(B) IPC and Section 9(m) of the POCSO Act The high court’s ruling was based on the argument that ""an attempt to commit rape must go beyond the stage of preparation and actual attempt to commit an offence consists chiefly in the greater degree of determination.""""The specific allegation against Akash is that he tried to drag the victim beneath the culvert and broke the string of her pyjama. It is also not stated by witnesses that due to this act of the accused the victim got naked or got undressed.

SC order sets benchmark for fines in tree-felling cases

NEW DELHI: Observing that the act of cutting a large number of trees was worse than killing a human being, Supreme Court on Tuesday said no mercy should be shown to people who damage the environment and approved imposing a fine of Rs 1 lakh for each illegally cut tree.Sending out a clear message that those indulging in illegal cutting of trees without approval from the authority concerned and damaging the environment must be dealt with an iron hand, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan rejected the plea of a man who had cut down 454 trees in the protected Taj Trapezium Zone.The bench accepted the suggestion of senior advocate ADN Rao, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, that a clear message needed to be sent to offenders that the law and trees could not, and should not, be taken for granted. With its order, the court has set a benchmark on how much fine should be imposed in such cases.“No mercy in environmental case. Felling a large number of trees is worse than killing a human. It will take at least 100 years minimum to again regenerate or recreate the green cover created by 454 trees which were blatantly cut without permission of this court though the embargo imposed by this court is right from the year 2015,” the bench said.The court accepted the report of the central empowered committee (CEC), which recommended a fine of Rs 1 lakh per tree for 454 trees which were cut last year by one Shiv Shankar Agarwal. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for him, told the bench that his client had admitted the mistake and apologised and urged the court to reduce the fine amount, which he said was exorbitant. He also said Agarwal should be allowed to do plantations at a nearby site and not on the same plot. Refusing to reduce the fine amount, the court, however, allowed him to do plantations in nearby areas.In its report, CEC said 454 trees were illegally felled on the night of Sept 18 last year out of which 422 trees were on private land known as Dalmia Farm situated at Vrindavan Chatikara Road, and the remaining 32 trees were on the roadside strip adjoining this private land which was a protected forest.Observing that the report revealed the shocking state of affairs and blatant violation of the SC’s order, the bench initiated contempt proceedings against Agarwal and asked CEC to suggest further measures to be taken against him.The panel suggested that the forest department should recover the penalty due under the provisions of UP Protection of Trees Act, 1976, for this illegal felling and the department should also take punitive action against the land owner for felling 32 trees that were in the protected forest as per the provisions under the Indian Forest Act, 1972","Supreme court of india sets benchmark for fines in tree-felling cases. Justices abhay s oka and ujjal bhuyan rejected the plea of a man who had cut down 454 trees in the protected taj trapezium zone. With its order, the court has set a benchmark on how much fine should be imposed in such cases.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119499101,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1126798,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A Mumbai-based techie turned to ""astrology"" in a bid to mend his life, unaware the only thing that was to align for him were not stars but a well-planned scam.The price paid for astrology piled up to an astronomical extent for the BKC man after he downloaded the DevineTalk application to find a fix to his problems.After installing the app, the man connected with a ""spiritual guide"" named Nishant in January. Nishant suggested that performing a ritual for Rs 6,300 could cleanse his life of negativity, police told news agency PTI.The software engineer, after a week of rumination, decided to go ahead with the ponzi prophecy.He reached out to Nishant, who assured him that a "" Bade Maharaj "" would personally conduct the sacred '' to heal his fate.""Nishant facilitated the conversation between the software engineer and Bade Maharaj through a conference call,"" according to the FIR. Later, what followed makes a classic case of spiritual extortion .Bade Maharaj demanded Rs 15,300 to begin the ritual and later added another Rs 28,000 under different reasons. Trusting their words, the victim made the payments electronically, police confirmed.When the techie asked for proof that the rituals had been performed, the fraudsters turned up the pressure.""When the victim demanded proof that rituals were performed by Bade Maharaj, the latter called up in the night and demanded an additional Rs 20,000, saying some rituals are incomplete,"" police said.The software engineer, skeptical but scared, hesitated. That’s when the fear tactics escalated.Bade Maharaj told him that incomplete rituals could harm his life. With panic creeping in, the victim found himself tangled deeper in the scam.Nishant reconnected him with Bade Maharaj, and by this time, he had transferred Rs 2.41 lakh. But the fraudsters weren’t done yet.The psychological pressure intensified—warnings of impending doom if the rituals weren't completed pushed the victim into financial freefall.He maxed out his credit cards, borrowed from private lenders, and continued paying, desperate to ""fix"" his cosmic misfortune. Over six days in January, the techie had drained Rs 12.20 lakh into the scam. The fraudsters still weren’t satisfied.It wasn't until he confided in his friends that he realised he had been played.Urged to investigate, he reached out to the customer support of DevineTalk, where a woman reassured him that the rituals would be completed—and as a gesture of goodwill, she even offered him three free meditation sessions.Skeptical, the techie checked online reviews of DevineTalk and discovered he wasn’t alone—several users had flagged the app for fraudulent activities.On Monday, the techie lodged a formal complaint with the cyber police, leading to an FIR under various sections of the BNS and the Information Technology Act (ITA).","A mumbai-based techie turned to ""astrology"" in a bid to mend his life, unaware the only thing that was to align for him were not stars but a well-planned scam.

Cannot tolerate such a process of demolition: SC

Clip of girl fleeing bulldozer sparks outrage in UP

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday pulled up the Uttar Pradesh govt for demolishing houses in Prayagraj within 24 hours of serving notice, saying it had ""shocked the conscience of the court"" and hinted that it would allow the aggrieved owners to rebuild their houses subject to the outcome of the case challenging the demolition. The case pertains to razing of the houses of a lawyer, a professor, and others in 2021.A bench of Justices Abhay Oka and N Kotishwar Singh, based on the claim by the aggrieved, took exception to the manner in which demolition was carried out and termed it the state's high-handedness. ""It shocks the conscience of the court the manner in which within 24 hours of the notice it was done,"" it said.The UP govt, however, disputed the version of the petitioners that the demolition squad had moved in a day after notices were served on them.Attorney general R Venkataramani, appearing for the state, argued that reasonable time was given to the petitioners to respond to the notice. He said on Dec 8, 2020, they were given the first notice, followed by notices in Jan 2021 and March 2021. The petitioners said the demolition notice was issued March 1, 2021, served on March 6, 2021, and demolition carried out on March 7.The petitioners said they were not given a reasonable opportunity to challenge the demolition notice before the appellate authority under Section 27(2) of the UP Urban Planning and Development Act.""State must act very fairly and state must give reasonable time to enable them to file an appeal before the structures are demolished. Notice served on March 6 and demolition carried out on March 7. Now, we will allow them to reconstruct,"" the bench said.The bench pointed out that the notices were served by affixture, which is not the method approved by the law and only the last notice was served through the legally recognised method.""Therefore, we are going to pass order only in the light of these facts. The manner in which the whole process has been conducted... the court cannot tolerate such a process. If we tolerate in one case, it will continue. We will pass an order that they can reconstruct at their own cost and if the appeal fails, then they will have to demolish at their own cost,"" it said.The court asked the petitioners to file an undertaking and adjourned the case. The petitioners in the case are advocate Zulfiqar Haider, Prof Ali Ahmed and three other individuals. They moved the apex court after Allahabad high court dismissed their plea against the demolition.The video of an eight-year-old girl clutching her books and running away from her shanty during an anti-encroachment drive in Ambedkar Nagar’s Jalalpur area in UP has sparked widespread outrage.The footage, which surfaced on social media, showed an earthmover revving nearby, drawing sharp criticism from opposition parties. Former UP CM and SP president Akhilesh Yadav condemned the demolition, calling it an example of the state’s deteriorating condition.On Monday, he posted on X, “Eight years, UP ruined, and only questions remain.” He also shared an AI-generated image of a girl holding books while a bulldozer loomed in the background.

Officials clarified that troops conducted precautionary firing after detecting suspicious movement.Security forces deployed an army helicopter above the area while joint army units, including specially-equipped commandos with heavy weaponry, sniffer dogs, drones and unmanned aerial vehicles, continued searching for terrorists believed to be trapped within the zone.The Special Operations Group (SOG) launched the operation after receiving intelligence about terrorists hiding in a 'dhok'—a local enclosure—at a nursery in Sanyal village, about five km from the Pakistan border, officials said.The hiding terrorists responded with intense gunfire towards the police unit, resulting in a fierce exchange lasting for more than half an hour, they said. Additional forces were promptly deployed to capture the terrorists, who allegedly infiltrated on Saturday either through ravines or via a newly constructed tunnel.Officials reported no casualties from the initial exchange, and the area remained under strict security throughout the night before forces advanced at daybreak.Despite no further contact with the terrorists, Monday's search revealed four loaded M4 carbine magazines, two grenades, a bulletproof jacket, sleeping bags, tracksuits, food packets, and several polythene bags, which will be examined by the bomb disposal squad, officials said.Intelligence suggests two separate groups, each comprising at least five terrorists, infiltrated on Saturday. Local residents organised food provisions for security personnel and media representatives stationed at the outer cordon.Village women gathering firewood spotted approximately five terrorists taking shelter in the large nursery area, as reported by officials.A young girl, aged seven, sustained minor wounds when a bullet grazed her arm. She was subsequently transported to a nearby hospital.According to PTI, Anita Devi, aged 48, around 4:30 pm on Sunday recounted how armed terrorists apprehended her husband whilst they were collecting firewood at the nursery.""The terrorists held my husband at gunpoint and asked me to come near. But my husband signalled me to run and I ran. One of the terrorists tried to stop me but I started shouting, which attracted the attention of two more people who were cutting grass,"" Anita Devi said.","Security forces in jammu and kashmir's kathua district found four loaded m4 carbine magazines, two grenades, a bulletproof jacket, sleeping bags, and food supplies.

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee on Tuesday accused Union agriculture and rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan of working for the wealthy and acting as a ""dalal (broker) for the rich"".He criticized the Union government for not releasing central funds to West Bengal under schemes like MGNREGA and PMAYG .Speaking to reporters outside Parliament, Banerjee alleged that funds had not been given to West Bengal for three years. He claimed this was because the BJP could not form a government in the state.""Shivraj Chouhan is a 'dalal' (broker) for the rich. He doesn't work for the poor and that's why he was removed from the post of Madhya Pradesh chief minister,"" Banerjee said. He repeated the remark multiple times.During Question Hour in the Lok Sabha, MPs from the DMK and Trinamool Congress protested against what they said was a delay in MGNREGA payments to some states. The Speaker adjourned the session until noon.Banerjee, in his statement, further alleged that the Centre’s claim about 25 lakh fake job cards under MGNREGA was being used as a reason to withhold funds. He said, ""They have not given us funds for the last three years. They are saying there are some discrepancies... (that) there are 25 lakh fake job cards (under MGNREGA)... We have told them to carry forward criminal proceedings against the fake cards, but they can't deprive 10 crore people of West Bengal of the funds.""He claimed that the BJP’s failure to win West Bengal in the 2021 assembly elections was the reason for the delay in funds. ""Shivraj Chouhan and PM Narendra Modi are against Bengal. They want to form a government there and are failing. They will never come to power there. BJP leaders say don't give funds to Bengal,"" he said.The BJP responded, with minister of state for agriculture Bhagirath Choudhary demanding an apology for the remarks made against Chouhan. ""This is not a good thing, such language by a senior MP does not suit him. PM Modi is working on the principle of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'. There is no discrimination against any state and everyone is getting their share,"" Choudhary said while talking to news agency PTI.He also said, ""Unfortunately, the West Bengal government changes the names of central schemes and indulges in corruption.
