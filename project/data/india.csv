It streamlines procedures for citizens by reducing paperwork, minimising travel and eliminating physical documentation. It also strengthens access for NRIs by removing geographical barriers and allowing them to assert their consumer rights from abroad.The department said with its OTP-based registration, e-Jagriti enables people, including NRIs, to file complaints, make digital or offline fee payments, participate in virtual hearings, exchange documents online and track cases in real time. It is operational at the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) and in all states and UTs“NRIs and citizens can file and manage cases from any location, with secure end-to-end encryption and role-based permissions.Automated workflows, real-time updates via SMS/email, and virtual hearings have contributed to disposal rates exceeding 100% in 10 states and in the NCDRC recently. Features such as multilingual interfaces and accessibility tools make it user-friendly for diverse demographics, while integration with Bharat Kosh and PayGov gateways ensures hassle-free fee payments,” an official said.The department said the platform has recorded an increase in disposal efficiency this year. Between July-Aug, 27,545 cases were disposed of against 27,080 filed, and in Sept-Oct, 24,504 cases were disposed of against 21,592 filed — both surpassing the 2024 performance and demonstrating faster resolution of complaints.","The e-jagriti platform integrates legacy systems and portals into a single seamless interface.

"Bihar elections: Smallest member of opposition bloc, but with victory under its belt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-elections-smallest-member-of-opposition-bloc-but-with-victory-under-its-belt/articleshow/125374479.cms,"Bihar Assembly Poll Results: NDA Touches 200-Seat Lead, Congress Intensifies SIR, Vote Chori Attacks

NEW DELHI: The smallest member of Mahagathbandhan in Bihar has made its presence felt in an otherwise trainwreck of an election for the opposition. In a state crowded with sub-regional satraps who are identified with their castes, I P Gupta of Indian Inclusive Party has come into the limelight by successfully mobilising members of castes that have long been on the margins.Gupta (55) won from Saharsa by defeating his BJP rival by over 2,000 votes, marking a successful electoral debut for his party which had contested three seats as an MGB constituent.It was an outcome that eluded better-known parties helmed by much bigger names. Jan Suraaj Party of Prashant Kishor and Vikashsheel Insaan Party of Mukesh Sahani, the latter an RJD ally like Gupta, are two such examples. While Kishor fielded candidates in over 235 seats, VIP contested 12. Both parties drew a blank.Gupta quit Congress in 2023 to champion the cause of Tanti-Tatwa, which falls under Extremely Backward Classes and is estimated to be 1-2% of the population, and pushed for a separate quota for them along with members of the Paan community. He blamed the state's NDA govt for the Supreme Court verdict that had overturned the move to grant SC quota to Tanti-Tatwa (historically weavers) and put the community back in the EBC category.He showed a knack for mobilisation by organising a successful rally in Patna's huge Gandhi Maidan in April, coming to the notice of parties of all hues in the election year. He said he was contacted by formations from across the political spectrum, from NDA to AIMIM and MGB, before he reached a deal with the opposition alliance. He held meetings with Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi Yadav and accused NDA of trying to sabotage his politics while holding talks with him.An engineer who ran a business before plunging into politics, Gupta's stock is likely to rise in a state where mobilisation along caste lines is central to political shifts.","I p gupta of indian inclusive party has come into the limelight by successfully mobilising members of castes that have long been on the margins.

‘Full Stop to Many Questions’ Chirag Paswan Hails PM Modi, Nitish as NDA Soars Past 200 Seats

NEW DELHI: RJD leader Rohini Acharya’s announcement that she is quitting politics, along with emotional allegations of humiliation and abuse by her own family, drew sympathy from Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan, who referenced his own experiences with personal crises while responding to the matter.On Saturday, Rohini declared that she was separating from both her family and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). A day later, she escalated her allegations, accusing her brother Tejashwi Yadav of humiliating and abusing her, claiming that the situation deteriorated to the point where “a slipper was raised to hit her.”In a post on X, she wrote, ""Yesterday, a daughter, a sister, a married woman, a mother was humiliated, abuses were hurled, shoes were raised to kill her... I didn't compromise on my self-respect, didn't give up on truth... just because of this, I had to face insults. Yesterday, a daughter left her crying parents and siblings due to helplessness... she was forced to leave her parental home... she was made an orphan... I pray that none of you ever have to walk my path, and no house should have a daughter-sister like Rohini. ""Speaking to reporters Sunday, Chirag Paswan said, ""I will not make any comments on this because I can understand the mental status when a family goes through such a difficult situation.I have also been through this.”Paswan added that political differences have never affected his personal warmth toward Lalu Prasad Yadav’s children.""We might have had political differences but I have always considered Lalu ji's family my own. Be it Tejashwi, Tej, Misa or Rohini, I have considered them my siblings,"" he said, as quoted by ANI.""I pray that this family dispute is resolved at the earliest. If there is unity in the family, a person can fight tough situations outside. The family must be going through a tough situation,"" he added.Rohini’s public fallout comes on the heels of the RJD’s dramatic electoral collapse, with the Tejashwi-led party winning just 25 of 143 seats- a loss of more than 100 seats.Her brother Tej Pratap Yadav, who himself was expelled from both the Yadav family and the RJD a few months earlier, also reacted to the developments, warning those he called “traitors” and issuing an emotional appeal to his father, Lalu Prasad Yadav.",Rohini acharya announced that she is leaving the rashtriya janata dal (rjd) her brother tejashwi yadav has been accused of humiliating and abusing her.

"Bihar elections: With NDA sweep, number of M-Y MLAs in Bihar hits a low",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-elections-with-nda-sweep-number-of-m-y-mlas-in-bihar-hits-a-low/articleshow/125374331.cms,"Bihar Assembly Poll Results: NDA Touches 200-Seat Lead, Congress Intensifies SIR, Vote Chori Attacks

NEW DELHI: In an election marked by determined consolidation of votes against the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan (MGB), the social composition of the newly elected MLAs too has changed strikingly with the share of Muslims and Yadavs hitting a low. What is just as striking : NDA now boasts more Yadav MLAs than the MGB.The decline in the M-Y block has seen a corresponding rise in MLAs belonging to other voting blocs - from non-Yadav OBCs to Extremely Backward Classes and upper castes - which is evidence of RJD's abysmal failure to expand its support base meaningfully beyond its traditional Muslim-Yadav base.Muslims at 17.7% and Yadavs at 14.3% make up the two biggest voting groups, but they have not been able to harness their numbers due to a larger counter-consolidation of other communities since 2005 when Nitish Kumar-led NDA to its first assembly poll win. The 2015 poll when Nitish had aligned with MGB was an exception.Muslim representation in the 243-member assembly is the lowest now, with only 11 as against 19 in 2020. The number of Yadav MLAs has shrunk by almost half to 28 from 55. The number of MLAs from the most populous caste is the lowest in the post-Mandal era, which saw the community fuelling Lalu Prasad's rise, with RJD governing Bihar from 1990 to 2005.What is equally telling is that it is not RJD but the Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM that now has the most Muslim MLAs (5).RJD has 3, Congress 2, and JDU 1, with the last being the lone Muslim representative from NDA.Muslims' preference for AIMIM, at least in seats where their numbers are decisive, convey their growing impatience with ""secular"" formations which, the community complains, bank on their solid support but fight shy of airing their issues or giving them proportionate representation fearing Hindu consolidation.Some opposition netas are of the view that Muslims began rallying behind AIMIM, especially in Seemanchal, after MGB named Mukesh Sahani, whose caste accounts for just around 2.6% of the population, as its deputy CM candidate. That RJD had given tickets to only 18 Muslims as against 51 Yadavs also irked Muslims, especially the young population, and a section of them broke ranks to back Owaisi.In NDA, JDU had given tickets to 4 Muslims and LJP(RV) to 1, but only one of them, Zama Khan, a minister in the outgoing govt, could win.As Yadavs appeared to consolidate behind MGB, NDA gave them fewer seats. JDU, which has traditionally fielded a decent number of Muslim candidates, also cut down from eight in 2020 to four due to a perceived lack of support over its alliance with BJP. However, the overwhelming victory of NDA has led to the unusual scenario of its having more Yadav lawmakers (15) in the assembly than MGB (12). Incidentally, the lone BSP MLA is also a Yadav.Though Muslim-Yadav representation corresponds with the fortunes of MGB, the polarisation and counter-polarisation witnessed in this election as the NDA campaign foregrounded the misrule associated with the 'jungle raaj' of RJD, has especially hit the two communities.","Muslims at 17.7% and yadavs at 14.3% make up the two biggest voting groups. Muslim representation in the 243-member assembly is the lowest now, with only 11 as against 19 in 2020. The number of yadav mlas has shrunk by almost half to 28 from 55.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125374400,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-21664,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The NIA has arrested a Kashmiri resident who had conspired with suicide bomber Umar Un Nabi to carry out the suicide blast at Red Fort last Monday.Amir Rashid Ali, a resident of Samboora, Pampore, in whose name the car involved in the attack was registered, was arrested in Delhi.""Amir had come to Delhi to facilitate the purchase of the car, which was eventually used as a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (IED) to trigger the blast,"" the NIA said.The NIA also confirmed on Sunday that it had forensically established the identity of the deceased driver of the vehicle-borne IED as Umar Un Nabi, a resident of Pulwama district who worked as an assistant professor in general medicine department in Al Falah University at Faridabad.The anti-terror agency has also seized another vehicle belonging to Nabi, it said.

Kishor would at best be a spoiler, many of his critics had said

NEW DELHI: Prashant Kishor 's Jan Suraaj Party lost its deposit in 236 of the 238 seats that it contested but data suggests it may have played spoiler in quite a few seats. In 35 constituencies, the party's votes were higher than the winning margin. NDA won 19 of these seats while 14 went to Mahagathbandhan. AIMIM and BSP each won one of these seats.Of course, the fact that Jan Suraaj got more votes than the margin in a seat does not necessarily mean it made the difference to the outcome since there is no way of knowing where those votes would otherwise have gone.The party came third in 115 seats and in one, Marhaura, it finished second.Of the 35 seats, within NDA, JDU, Kishor's former party, won 10 of these seats while BJP won five. The tally was three for LJP-RV and one for RLM.In the MGB camp, RJD was the winner in nine of these seats while Congress won two. One seat each went to CPM, CPIML-L and IIP.Despite his amplified presence on the social media, many critics of the party had claimed that Prashant Kishor would at best be a spoiler.Some felt his upper caste identity meant he would cut into BJP's vote while others argued he would divide the anti-incumbency youth votes since he was talking about issues like migration from the state.","In 35 constituencies, the party's votes were higher than the winning margin.

BENGALURU: A routine temple visit turned costly for a software engineer whose shoes, worth Rs 16,000, were stolen from outside Shri Ganesha Temple in Banashankari III Stage, south Bengaluru.When cops were initially reluctant to file an FIR for footwear theft, the techie insisted they do so because he claimed it's a common occurrence outside temples.The Girinagar resident told police his shoes, bought just six months back, were stolen between 7.20pm and 7.25pm on Nov 6. Wearing his branded shoes (Asics), the complainant visited the temple on his motorcycle. He parked his bike and left his shoes in front of the temple where other devotees had left their footwear.After offering prayers, he walked out of the temple within five minutes only to find his shoes missing. He then approached the temple management and priest. ""I learned that it was a common problem in the temple. The thieves have not even spared the priest. His slippers were stolen twice in the past. Many devotees too shared incidents of losing their footwear. But none of them had filed a complaint with police. I didn't want to ignore such incidents,"" the complainant told TOI.The CCTV camera installed at the temple entrance caught the thief walking barefoot, posing as a devotee, and leaving with the complainant's shoes.A couple of footwear thieves were caught in the past, and they revealed that they usually sold the stolen footwear for Rs 20 to Rs 50 to buy liquor.""If small thefts are ignored, the same person will commit bigger crimes, so they should be taught a lesson and reformed,"" said the complainant.A senior police officer said a case has been registered under the BNS section 303 (theft), CCTV footage have been collected and efforts are on to nab the thief.","Software engineer's shoes, worth rs 16,000, stolen from outside shri ganesha temple in south bengaluru.

Sensing the terror plot – suspected to have been planned by Umar and Muzammil over two years – unravelling, Umar looked for a hideout and, according to investigators, found one in Hidayat Colony where an electrician associated with the university helped him rent a room. Sources said the owner of the house has been detained for questioning.Police and National Investigation Agency are also tracking a hawala network operating in the Mewat region that Umar and the radicalised doctors’ module used for money transfers. Two hawala operators’ financial trails are being investigated, sources said. The fresh leads triggered nightlong raids in Nuh, Faridabad and other places.Teams also conducted searches of quarters where doctors associated with Umar and Muzammil live inside the university and also rooms of students and interns who worked with the two doctors as well as Dr SHAHIN Shaheed, the third accused from Al-Falah arrested in the probe.Soon after the explosion at Srinagar’s Nowgam police station on Friday night, meanwhile, a massive search and combing operation was undertaken at Al-Falah University after midnight. Sources said a convoy of more than 30 police and NaTIONAL Security Guard vehicles reached Al-Falah University. They also conducted a sweep of surrounding areas.J&K Police clarified on Saturday the Nowgam explosion was accidental. Explosive substances allegedly procured by Umar and Muzammil and seized from Faridabad last Sunday were taken to Nowgam.A restaurant owner near the university said the scale of the convoy was unlike anything he had seen before. “They were all over the road. People were being detained. Someone from our village was also taken but later released after it turned out to be a misidentification,” he said.On Saturday morning, Faridabad police’s crime branch deployed its personnel at the university entrance to record details of anyone entering the campus, even security personnel. A police officer said seniors had issued clear instructions to maintain detailed logs to ensure no unauthorised person enters the campus posing as a security officer.Teams from UP Police and the Lucknow NIA unit, including an SP-rank officer, also visited the Al-Falah campus on Saturday. Amid a heightened threat perception, Faridabad police launched extensive checks across the district. According to police spokesperson Yashpal, teams inspected around 140 places of worship, 1,700 tenants, 40 fertilizer–seed shops and nearly 200 guest houses .","Umar un nabi, the doctor at the heart of the delhi terror plot, hid in hidayat colony in nuh for 10 days before the incident.

NEW DELHI: The special cell of Delhi Police has filed an FIR to probe what it claimed was a deeper conspiracy in connection with the car blast near Red Fort.The first FIR registered under UAPA was transferred to NIA. The special cell has invoked sections of criminal conspiracy in this FIR and will reportedly make arrests soon.The blast was so powerful that the ground nearby shook, intelligence sources said on Friday, citing fresh CCTV footage of underground areas of Red Fort metro station. It shows the entire station experiencing a significant tremor causing goods on a cart to shake and rattle. The footage also reveals widespread chaos as panic-stricken commuters run for safety.Explosive experts who picked up samples from the spot are yet to give their report detailing the nature of the bomb, though police maintain Umar Un Nabi, who was behind the wheel when the car blew up, possibly used military grade explosives.Sleuths examined new CCTV footage of the route taken by Umar. “While travelling on Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, he stopped near a dhaba but didn’t eat anything and slept in his car, the footage shows.On the day of the explosion, Umar stopped at a small shop in Wazirpur and had tea. He was there for around 15 minutes but didn’t talk to anyone,” said a cop.Meanwhile, two doctors were detained for questioning from Haryana’s Nuh district on Thursday night, sources said. One of them pursued an MBBS course from China and recently finished an internship at Al-Falah University. Police informed his family that he was detained for questioning after he allegedly talked to some terror suspects.Suspicious numbers were found on his mobile phone, the cops claimed. The person recently appeared for a job interview at a prestigious medical institution in south Delhi. The other doctor also interned at Al-Falah.Haryana’s Nuh district has come under the radar of intel agencies following the blast. In the last week, five suspects — three MBBS doctors, a fertiliser vendor, and an imam — were taken into custody from the area. Multiple raids have been conducted in the district, which was earlier known as Mewat.Sources in the agencies suggest ammonium nitrate, which could have been used in the explosion, was purchased from Nuh. This suspicion is fuelled by reports that past locations of Umar and his doctor colleague, Muzammil, have been traced to Mewat on multiple occasions.The probe has revealed members of the ‘doctor module’ would draft emails in a shared account without sending them. The recipient would log in, read the draft and delete it to avoid leaving digital evidence. This method is generally used in spycraft. The module also used the Threema app, which operates without phone numbers or email IDs, and possibly created a private server to share maps and locations.",Special cell of delhi police has filed an fir to probe what it claimed was a deeper conspiracy in connection with the car blast near red fort.

Insult meted out to my sister is intolerable: Tej Pratap

PATNA/NEW DELHI: RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad's daughter Rohini Acharya's outburst at her brother Tejashwi Yadav and his close associates for ""abusing"" and ""throwing"" her out of home is snowballing into a full-blown family feud and hints at increasing internal rumblings over the decisions of the party's anointed heir after its bid for office unravelled spectacularly in the assembly polls.As she dropped another bombshell on Sunday by saying she was dissed for donating her ""dirty kidney"" to Lalu and was accused of extracting crores of rupees and a Lok Sabha ticket, three of her sisters - Ragini, Chanda and Rajlakshmi - left their parents' Patna residence.Their brother Tej Pratap Yadav, disowned by his father and ousted from the party last year, spoke up against Rohini's ""humiliation"".Lalu, his younger son and political heir Tejashwi, and other family members have maintained silence, an indication of the division and conflicted emotions within. The party too has kept mum.Some party leaders suggested that differences among the siblings have long been simmering as Tejashwi took firmer control of the party and leaned on a set of advisers loyal to him to run its affairs. That arrangement has come up for questioning.But the Bihar assembly poll debacle has opened up this style of functioning to questioning. Rohini said everybody is wondering what fate has befallen RJD, a party that governed Bihar between 1990 and 2005.Tej Pratap said in a social media post, ""Yesterday's incident has shaken me. But the insult meted out to my sister is intolerable.""I tolerated whatever happened to me but her humiliation cannot be tolerated under any condition... The consequence of this injustice will be very dire.""He accused 'Jaichands' (betrayers), widely believed to be a reference to a couple of Tejashwi's close associates, including Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Yadav, of targeting the Yadav family. Appealing to Lalu, he said, ""Just one nod, and the people of Bihar will bury these Jaichands themselves. This fight is not for any party; it is for the honour of the family, the dignity of the daughter, and the self-respect of Bihar.""As the family fallout played out, TV footage showed three more daughters of Lalu's reaching Patna airport with their children to catch a flight, reportedly for Delhi. None of them spoke to the media. Incidentally, their departure came hours after Rohini advised women to ""look after your in-laws and families and take care of your children"" rather than parents.""I would tell all married women never to do anything to save their parents, and if they have a brother, they should ask him to donate his own kidney or ask his Haryanavi friend to do so,"" she said in an emotional post. She said she had committed a blunder by not obtaining permission from her husband and in-laws and not thinking about the future of her three children before donating a kidney to her father.Earlier, she alleged she was humiliated and abused, and a slipper was lifted to hit her. She said her parents, Lalu and Rabri Devi, both former CMs, were crying and blamed Sanjay Yadav and Rameez Nemat Khan, who hails from Uttar Pradesh and is said to be Tejashwi's friend, for her ""fate"".She named her brother too but directed most of her anger at his two associates.The developments followed RJD's disastrous performance in the just-held assembly elections in Bihar, in which the party could win only 25 seats after contesting 143. Tejashwi was officially projected as MGB's chief ministerial candidate.Meanwhile, the JD(U) asked Lalu to explain the developments and act. ""She is the daughter of entire Bihar, then why are you silent, Lalu ji... Please break your silence,"" JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said.","Rohini acharya's outburst at her brother tejashwi yadav is snowballing into a full-blown family feud.

LUCKNOW/KANPUR: Investigators are racing to close the arc of a Jaish-e-Mohammed project they said was years in the making - one that turned a campus doctor into ""Madam Surgeon"" of a cross-border terrorist blueprint.The alleged architect linking these threads is 43-year-old Dr Shaheen Shahid - ""Madam Surgeon"" in the underground lexicon of the JeM module of medics accused of the Nov 10 New Delhi car blast and preparing coordinated terrorist strikes on six cities, investigators said.Investigators described Shaheen, arrested in Faridabad, as a key asset. Seized digital evidence, handwritten diaries and planning notes - now central to the case - describe a plan for a Dec 6 strike aimed at ""avenging"" the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition The papers outline ""D-6 Mission"", target lists, recruitment pitches, fund movements and secure communication protocols. Investigators also identified roles assigned to Kashmiri doctors Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie and Umar Un Nabi, alongside Shaheen, who allegedly joined a deeper JeM-backed structure in 2021.The probe has allegedly uncovered an Rs 20-lakh hawala channel routed through a JeM handler for operational use by Umar, Muzammil and Shaheen - money suspected to have funded recruitment, safe houses, secure phones and reconnaissance.Agencies have begun an audit of Shaheen's financial footprint, scrutinising every high-value transfer, cash withdrawal and unexplained deposit across her three Kanpur accounts, two Lucknow accounts and two Delhi accounts. The hunt: any tie to the foreign-funded module.Teams are also reconstructing Shaheen's movements in Kanpur, especially at GSVM Medical College, where she worked until her unexplained disappearance. Officials are collecting entry logs, duty rosters, visitor lists and details of where she stayed between Jan and Oct 2025. Colleagues remembered a soft-spoken doctor from Lucknow who rarely took leave, brought her young child to duty because there was ""no one at home"", and avoided speaking about her divorce. She lived in an L-Block campus residence, maintained cordial ties with women co-workers, and vanished in Dec 2013 after handing over HOD responsibilities, promising to return by Jan 4, 2014. She never did. For nearly a year, official letters went unanswered. In 2016, two staffers sent to her registered address found it incorrect. She was formally dismissed in 2021.Interrogations showed that in March 2022, the module travelled to Turkiye for a meeting with ISI handler Abu Ukasha, allegedly securing a ""green signal"" for the Dec 6 plan. The timeline under reconstruction spans 2010 ideological drift, 2015-16 induction into JeM circles, and structured planning from 2021 as part of a project backed by Pakistan-based handlers.A former GSVM staffer recalled her transformation beginning around 2010 after contact with an Indian-origin doctor abroad who shared ideological videos and literature. She soon adopted new attire, including a hijab, and repeatedly spoke of relocating overseas.According to officials, her ideological shift was unmistakable by 2021. When confronted by a relative about abandoning her marriage, job and family, she allegedly said: ""I have lived enough for myself. Now, it's time to repay the debt of my community.""","Investigators describe dr shaheen shahid, arrested in faridabad, as a key asset.

Rohini jo bolti hai, sach bolti hai

NEW DELHI: Rohini Acharya, daughter of Rashtriya Janata Dal ( RJD ) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav , on Sunday recounted what she says unfolded during the family feud that erupted after the Mahagathbandhan’s crushing defeat in the Bihar assembly elections, stressing that she is “not lying about any of the events. ”She added that her parents — former Bihar chief ministers Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi — as well as her sisters “cried” for her following Saturday’s developments.“Whatever I had to say, I have already said on my social media. I have not lied about anything that happened.(Whatever Rohini says is the truth). You may go and ask Tejashwi Yadav , Sanjay Yadav, Rachel Yadav, and Rameez. My father has always stood by me. My parents and my sisters were crying for me yesterday. I am blessed to have parents like them,” she told reporters.Rachel Yadav is Acharya’s sister-in-law — her brother Tejashwi's wife, who adopted the name Rajshree after their marriage. Sanjay Yadav and Rameez Nemat have been accused by Rohini of being behind the events that made her “disown” her family and quit politics. Sanjay Yadav is a close confidante of Tejashwi and an RJD Rajya Sabha MP.Rameez, also an RJD leader and Tejashwi’s childhood friend, is the son-in-law of Rizwan Zaheer, a former MP from the Balrampur Lok Sabha seat in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh.“I feel fortunate to have parents like mine. In a family, why is it that only daughters are expected to make sacrifices, especially when there are brothers? When questions were asked of the brothers, they told me to go to my in-laws’ house. As a result, I have decided to disown my brother (Tejashwi),” she added.The former RJD leader mentioned that she is now heading to Mumbai to stay with her mother-in-law. “She is worried and has been crying since yesterday,” Acharya noted.On Saturday, a day after the results were declared and the RJD and its allies suffered a rout — dashing Tejashwi Yadav’s hopes of becoming the third chief minister from the family — Rohini Acharya announced on social media that she was “disowning” her family and quitting politics. She blamed Sanjay Yadav and Rameez Nemach for the situation.“Yesterday, a daughter, a sister, a married woman, a mother was humiliated; abuses were hurled, shoes were raised to kill her… I did not compromise on my self-respect, I did not give up on truth… and because of that, I faced insults. Yesterday, a daughter left her crying parents and siblings out of helplessness… she was forced to leave her parental home… she was made an orphan. I pray that none of you ever have to walk my path, and no home should ever have a daughter-sister like Rohini,” she wrote on X earlier on Sunday.","Rohini acharya, daughter of rashtriya janata dal ( rjd ) chief lalu prasad yadav, on sunday recounted what she says unfolded during the family feud.

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya on Sunday termed the Bihar assembly election outcome “abnormal,” claiming it was shaped by three “experiments.""According to him, these included the transfer of Rs 10,000 to women under the Mahila Rojgar Yojana, the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, and the transfer of land to a ""corporate house"" at a “throwaway price.”“The poll dates were not announced until all the targeted welfare schemes of the government, including the provision of Rs 10,000 for women, materialised. This is an unprecedented and unique experiment in India’s electoral history,” Bhattacharya told reporters in Patna, two days after the results were declared.The CPI(ML)L, a constituent of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-led Mahagathbandhan, won just two of the 20 seats it contested — a sharp fall from the 12 out of 19 it secured in 2020. Overall, the three Left parties in the alliance won only three of 33 seats this time, compared to 16 out of 29 in the previous election.Speaking on SIR, Bhattacharya said the deletion of 65 lakh voters and the later addition of 3.5–4 lakh names before the polls had a ""significant impact"" on the result.He added that the third issue — the land transfer — had been raised by the opposition but failed to resonate with the voters, cautioning that it would “normalise the corporatisation of Bihar’s resources.”“From November 18 to 24, our candidates and party workers will go among the people as part of a feedback and public outreach exercise. We need to stop these experiments; otherwise, there will be no level-playing field in politics,” the Left leader stated.The Bihar assembly elections were held on November 6 and 11, covering 121 and 122 constituencies respectively.The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) secured a sweeping victory, winning 202 of the 243 seats. The Mahagathbandhan managed just 35 seats.

SRINAGAR: Inspector Asrar Ahmad Shah called his cousin at 10.50pm on Friday, asking him to wait on the highway so they could drive home to Kupwara together after work. Thirty minutes later, an explosion ripped through Srinagar's Nowgam police station, killing Asrar and eight others.

Just a day after declaring she was distancing herself, Rohini accused Tejashwi of humiliating and abusing her, claiming that matters escalated to the point where ""a slipper was raised to hit her. ""Taking to X, Rohini wrote an emotional post, stating she was forced to leave behind her aged parents, Lalu Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi - in tears while protecting her dignity. She posted writing in Hindi, which translates to: ""Yesterday, a daughter, a sister, a married woman, a mother was humiliated, filthy abuses were hurled at her, a slipper was raised to hit her. I did not compromise on my self-respect, I did not surrender the truth, and solely because of this, I had to endure this insult.

May none of you ever walk my path, may no family ever have a daughter-sister like Rohini.""In a second post, Rohini referred to her kidney donation to her father in 2022 while alleging that personal and offensive remarks were made about it. She wrote that she was taunted for having ""put a filthy kidney"" into her father and accused of having ""taken millions of rupees and bought a ticket"" for the transplant.She further posted, ""If there’s a son or brother in your parents’ home, then… tell your brother to get a kidney transplant from himself or his Haryanvi mates instead. ""Rohini also wrote, ""All you sisters and daughters, look after your own home and family… without a thought for your parents… with me, it was a massive sin to not look after my family or my three children, to not get permission from my husband or my in-laws before donating… which today has been branded as filthy.""A day earlier, Rohini had already shocked RJD supporters by alleging, ""I have no family. You can go and ask this to Sanjay Yadav, Rameez, and Tejashwi Yadav.

NIA Arrests Alleged Aide Of ‘Suicide Bomber’ Umar Nabi In Delhi Terror Attack

Also read:

NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Sunday said it has arrested an aide of suicide bomber Umer un Nabi who had carried out the Nov 10 car blast, for allegedly facilitating purchase of the car in Delhi and conspiring with the bomber to carry out the terror attack.Amir Rashid Ali, a resident of Samboora, Pampore in J&K and in whose name the car involved in the attack was registered, was arrested from Delhi by the NIA, which had launched a massive search operation after taking over the case from Delhi Police.NIA described the arrest as “a major breakthrough” in the Red Fort area car bomb blast case.NIA investigations so far have revealed that accused Amir had come to Delhi to facilitate the purchase of the Hyundai i20 car used in the blast. NIA has forensically established the identity of the deceased driver of the vehicle-borne IED as Umer Un Nabi. Dr Umer hailed from Pulwama district of J&K and was working as an assistant professor in the general medicine department of Al Falah College of Medical Science and Research Centre, while also working for a Jaish terror module purportedly planning major, pan-India terror attacks. The massive recovery of over 2,900 kg of explosives foiled these plans.NIA on Sunday said it has seized another vehicle belonging to Nabi. The vehicle is being examined for evidence in the case.The central anti-terror agency has so far examined 73 witnesses, including those injured in the blast that had rocked the national capital on Nov 10 and claimed a dozen lives.“Working in close coordination with Delhi Police, Jammu & Kashmir Police, Haryana Police, UP Police and various sister agencies, NIA is continuing its investigation across states. It is pursuing multiple leads to unearth the larger conspiracy behind the bombing and identify others involved in the case RC-21/2025/NIA/DLI,” NIA said in a statement on Sunday.","Amir rashid ali, a resident of samboora, pampore in j&k, was arrested from delhi.

People of Bihar did not want the jungle raj to return: Jan Suraaj



(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Party on Sunday claimed that World Bank funds meant for some other project were diverted and transferred to women voters ahead of the Bihar Assembly elections.Jan Suraaj spokesperson Pavan Verma said the scale and timing of the payouts under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana had not only tilted the electoral field but were also sanctioned just an hour before the Model Code of Conduct came into force.He said the party had received information that Rs 14,000 crore out of a total Rs 21,000 crore linked to a World Bank-funded project had been used for this purpose.""The public debt in Bihar is at present 4,06,000 crores. The interest per day is 63 crores. The treasury is empty. We have information which could be wrong, also that the amount of Rs 10,000 given to women in the state was given from Rs 21,000 crores, which came from the World Bank for some other project. An hour before the moral code of conduct for the polls, Rs 14,000 crores were taken out and distributed to 1.25 crore women in the state,"" he claimed in an interview with news agency ANI.Union minister Chirag Paswan dismissed the allegations outright, questioning both the credibility of the data and the intent behind the accusations.""Where do they get this data from, this information from?... Making empty claims - if you have any facts, present it and the Govt will respond,"" the LJP(RV) chief said, as quoted by ANI.Verma further rejected suggestions that Prashant Kishor’s stand on lifting the liquor ban had damaged the party. He argued instead that the prohibition regime was already ineffective, with liquor “being sold at every nook and corner” and even home-delivered at inflated prices. He noted that over two lakh people, mostly from extremely backward Dalit communities, had been jailed under the prohibition law. “People are consuming it and paying more for it. Would that not affect women who have to run their homes?” he asked.Despite mounting a high-energy campaign and contesting all 243 seats, Jan Suraaj failed to win a single constituency. Verma said last-minute cash transfers, women-centric schemes, and a consolidation among voters who did not want the “jungle raaj” of the RJD to return proved decisive. “Nitish ji was the X factor… People of Bihar did not want the jungle raj of Lalu ji, RJD and Tejashwi to return,” he said.The ruling NDA got 202 seats, a three-fourths majority in the 243-member House. This is the second time the NDA has crossed the 200-mark in the assembly polls. In the 2010 polls, it had won 206 seats.Mahagathbandhan got just 35 seats with Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) winning 25 seats and Congress 6.",Prashant kishor’s jan suraaj party claims world bank funds were diverted and transferred to women voters ahead of the bihar assembly elections.

Karnataka Deputy CM DK Shivakumar Sparks Row By Singing RSS Anthem In Assembly, Then Clarifies

NEW DELHI: Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar on Sunday asserted there is “no need” for him to step down as the state Congress president, stressing that his health is “good” and that he has several responsibilities to discharge as Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) chief.“I have worked to build the party day in and day out, and I will continue to do so. My mental, physical and political health is good,” he told reporters in Bengaluru, according to ANI.Shivakumar noted that he must oversee the laying of foundation stones for 100 Congress party offices in Karnataka and is scheduled to meet Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge. “We have to celebrate the Congress foundation day (December 28). Who will do all this? I have to do it. Why should I resign from the KPCC presidency? There is no need for it,” he remarked.Describing himself as a “loyal soldier” of the party, he added that he would continue as KPCC chief for as long as the leadership wants him to remain in the role.On whether he would raise rumours of a Cabinet reshuffle during his meeting with Kharge, Shivakumar distanced himself from the matter. “That is left to the CM (Siddaramaiah). He will discuss it with the high command.I am meeting Kharge only to finalise dates for laying the foundation for the new Congress offices. I would like both Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi to lay the foundation stone. I am requesting a date before December 1 as the Parliament session starts that day,” he explained.Shivakumar’s reaffirmation of loyalty comes amid a renewed push from a section of the Karnataka Congress for him to be elevated as chief minister under the so-called “2.5-year formula” that party leaders had reportedly agreed upon after returning to power in May 2023, defeating the BJP.","Dk shivakumar says there is ""no need"" for him to step down as state congress president.
