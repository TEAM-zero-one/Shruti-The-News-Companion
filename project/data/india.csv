CrPC cover for women can’t be invoked in Fema case: Delhi HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/crpc-cover-for-women-cant-be-invoked-in-fema-case-delhi-hc/articleshow/125730860.cms,"Delhi high court

NEW DELHI: The protection enjoyed by a woman under Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) is not available in proceedings related to Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema), which is governed by civil law, Delhi high court has ruled.Justice Neena Bansal Krishna dismissed a writ petition filed by a 53-year-old Canadian citizen challenging ED summons issued under Fema Section 37 for recording of her statement, rejecting the contention that safeguards guaranteed to women under CrPC applied to such summons.The petitioner argued that she could not be compelled to appear at the ED office and her statement must be recorded at her residence. She cited CrPC Section 160(1), which prevents women from being required to appear at places other than their residence for investigation. However, the HC highlighted that Fema investigations were civil-administrative proceedings, not criminal inquiries, and therefore, the gender-based protection available under CrPC could not be invoked.“The PMLA and the Fema have distinct statutory frameworks and nature of proceedings. Section 50 PMLA confers criminal investigative powers on ED involving summons for inquiries related to money laundering, which is a scheduled offence under PMLA and involves criminal prosecution.In contrast, Section 37 Fema is primarily concerned with civil-administrative investigations of foreign exchange contraventions governed by a regulatory framework distinct from criminal law. Secondly, there is a difference in the scope of summons and procedural safeguards,” the court said.“Civil code contains no provision like Section 160 CrPC mandating the recording of the statement of a woman at her residence. The insistence of the petitioner for not appearing before the authority is, therefore, without any basis,” Justice Krishna observed.“Powers regarding discovery and production of evidence under Section 37 Fema are analogous to those under Section 131 Income Tax Act, which is governed by civil code and therefore, Section 160 CrPC would not be applicable,” HC added.","The protection enjoyed by a woman under code of criminal procedure (crpc) is not available in proceedings related to foreign exchange management act (fema), delhi high court rules.

KOLKATA: Even if a candidate under the reserved category scored higher than the cut-off marks and was upgraded to general category, s/he would continue to enjoy benefits of the former category, Calcutta high court held Tuesday.The directive came after an SSC candidate, who made it to the first list of the 2025 SLST exam, moved high court to restore her SC status even if she was upgraded to general category.SSC senior counsel Kalyan Bandyopadhyay sought HC’s permission to upgrade the candidate to the general category contending that another SC candidate with lower marks would miss the opportunity of being considered if the petitioner wanted to restore her status. Bandyopadhyay argued that the idea of reservation was meant for the welfare of a community and not for an individual.Justice Amrita Sinha, however, noted that the petitioner had marked herself as a reserved category candidate while filling the form and had submitted Rs 200, a fee meant for that category. The judge referred to her Nov 27 order, in which the court had held that once a candidate’s category was final, authorities could not “change it suo motu”.","Kolkata high court held that even if a candidate scored higher than the cut-off marks and was upgraded to general category, s/he would continue to enjoy benefits of the former category.

NAGPUR: Half a century passed bearing a trauma that had revolutionised anti-rape laws in India and saved thousands of identities from being exposed to shame, but when TOI's story on her plight put her back on the spotlight, Mathura forgot about her hardship and sought help for her two sons.On Tuesday, when Chandrapur district collector Vinay Gowda stepped into her ramshackle home in a tiny hamlet in east Maharashtra and wanted to know how he could help her, she demanded nothing, only jobs for her sons.Gowda and his team, surprised by her selflessness, have now begun planning contractual openings or business grants for her sons. ""The younger of the two seemed proactive. We can think of helping him start a shop or a goat-rearing business,"" said Gowda, who handed over a cheque of Rs8 lakh to Mathura. The cheque was given to the bank manager, who was in Gowda's team.""The cheque has been deposited and a fixed deposit opened, which would need the tehsildar's nod to encash. She would now get Rs5,000 per month as interest,"" said Gowda, who reached Mathura's home amid his tight schedule on a polling day in the district.Gowda further stated the govt would extend a grant under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana to build a home at the same place, where Mathura lives. The gram panchayat would carry out the construction, said the collector, who also deputed a person to coordinate and monitor her requirements.Gowda stated he's also contemplating helping Mathura get land under a scheme for the tribal population. ""Up to Rs 20 lakh grant can be allocated for 3-4 acres of land,"" said the collector, adding her ration card has been updated to ensure 30kg of grains, while benefits under the Niradhar Yojana would resume too.Mathura's custodial rape in 1972 triggered nationwide protests and ushered legal reforms. The fire was rekindled by the outgoing Chief Justice of India, BR Gavai, during a speech at a lecture series in Delhi.TOI's story on Mathura's impoverished life paved the way for nationwide concern and help poured in from various corners of the country.

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad high court has directed the Uttar Pradesh govt to ensure that anyone who converts to Christianity automatically forfeits all Scheduled Caste benefits, failing which it would be construed as a “fraud on the Constitution and contrary to the ethos of reservation policies”.Justice Praveen Kumar Giri’s Nov 21 order cites Paragraph 3 of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, specifying that nobody other than a Hindu, Sikh or Buddhist can be deemed a member of an Scheduled Caste community.The court directed the principal secretary of the minorities welfare department to take appropriate steps to ensure that the distinction between minority and SC status was strictly enforced.The court said retention of SC status after conversion would amount to fraudulently claiming benefits since there is no caste system in Christianity.It fixed a timeline of four months for all district magistrates to act in accordance with the law to identify and prevent such occurrences.Justice Giri passed the order while dismissing a plea filed by a man accused of “mocking Hindu deities” and promoting enmity.The appellant, Jitendra Sahani, had petitioned the court to quash the charge sheet in the case on the ground that he had sought permission from the authorities to “preach the words of Jesus Christ on my land”.Justice Giri noted that Sahani mentioned his religion as “Hindu” in his affidavit, although he had converted to Christianity.It transpired that the appellant was from the SC community before his conversion.A witness in the case alleged that Sahani ridiculed the Hindu faith by claiming it offered no respect due to caste hierarchies, whereas embracing Christianity would lead to “jobs, business growth and financial benefits from the missionaries”.The court mentioned a recent Supreme Court judgment – C Selvarani Vs special secretary-cum-district collector 2024 – in which the bench held that a person ceases to belong to a particular caste after converting to Christianity.",Allahabad high court has directed the uttar pradesh govt to ensure that anyone who converts to christianity automatically forfeits all scheduled caste benefits.

NEW DELHI: The family feud over industrialist Sunjay Kapur's Rs 30,000-crore estate got messier on Monday after his mother Rani Kapur joined forces with his ex-wife Karisma Kapoor in questioning the veracity of his will.Rani submitted before Justice Jyoti Singh of Delhi high court that instead of grieving Sunjay's death after accidentally swallowing a bee while playing polo in the UK on June 12, his wife Priya did everything to take control of his assets, including allegedly ""massive concealment"".Her counsel claimed she was never informed about her son's will, pointing out that it was strange that the document does not even mention her despite Sunjay publicly acknowledging that he got everything from her.""He (Sunjay) would have at least mentioned in the will that he did not want to give anything to his mother,"" Rani's lawyer Vaibhav Gaggar said.

CHENNAI: Cyclone Ditwah, which weakened into a deep depression over Bay of Bengal on a breezy Sunday evening, surprised residents on Monday by unleashing one of the wettest mornings of the season.The cyclone, stripped of much of its cloud cover on Sunday, moved northward through the Bay of Bengal. It staged a resurgence overnight, amassing moisture. Drifting slowly northward at 5km/h and edging closer to the coast, the weather system thickened cloud cover over city and suburbs, setting off steady prolonged showers from 5am. It dumped torrents over some parts of north Chennai and neighbouring districts Low-lying areas were flooded, children walked to school drenched, and traffic came to a crawl in most parts of the city. Around 10am, when most people were dodging potholes in traffic bottlenecks, India Meteorological Department reinstated an orange (very heavy rain) alert for the city and a red (extremely heavy rain) alert for Tiruvallur.Between 8.30am and 7.30pm, the city recorded “moderate” rainfall of 10cm, though it was heavy in some parts of North Chennai. Nungambakkam recorded 9.45cm, and Meenambakkam recorded 6.2cm. Ennore topped GCC records with 13cm of rain from 8:30am to 2pm, while Parry’s Corner, Ice House, Madhavaram, Saligramam, and Vadapalani each surpassed 10cm.On Sunday evening, when the cyclone weakened and the city was relatively dry, IMD withdrew the alert for Chennai to yellow (heavy rain) and Tiruvallur to orange. On Monday, weathermen said the system was likely to linger 30km-40km offshore along the coast and forecast heavy rain on Tuesday in Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, and Chengalpet.Cyclone Ditwah’s path, however, continued to be a topic of debate. While IMD said the system would fade into a depression and cross land near Nellore early on Tuesday, independent forecasters said there would be scattered bursts in Chennai, Tiruvallur, Chengalpet, and Kancheepuram. Blogger Pradeep John said he expected the clouds to regain as long as it was close to city coast. “The depression is going to stay for the next 36 hours near Chennai itself,” he said. Ditwah is neither able to move west nor east, he said. If this westerly trough influence moves away on Wednesday, then the cyclone will move west into TN or south AP coast into the land as a weakened cyclone, he said.","Cyclone ditwah dumped torrents over some parts of north chennai and neighbouring districts.

‘Is There Any Law?’ Renuka Chaudhary Sparks Row After Bringing Stray Dog to Parliament

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday weighed in on the controversy over colleague Renuka Chowdhury bringing a stray dog to Parliament House, saying pets are not allowed outside the complex but “inside”.“Dog is the main topic of today, I believe. What has the poor dog done. The dog had come here. Why is it not allowed?” Gandhi told reporters, as quoted by PTI.Pointing towards the Parliament House building, he said, “Pets are not allowed here but they are allowed inside.”“I guess these are the things that India is discussing these days,” he added.Gandhi’s comments drew criticism from BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari, who said on X, “Rahul Gandhi is comparing his own Congressmen, and Opposition leaders to Dog! This is how Parivarvadi treat temple of democracy.”Congress MP Renuka Chowdhury on Monday brought a stray dog onto the Parliament grounds on the first day of the Winter Session, despite objections from fellow MPs. Defending her action, she reportedly said that the ""real dogs are sitting in Parliament"" who regularly bite people.Chowdhury later explained that she had found the puppy on her way to Parliament. She said she stopped after witnessing a collision between a scooter and a car, and noticed the puppy by the roadside before deciding to take it with her.","Leader of opposition in lok sabha rahul gandhi says pets are not allowed outside the complex but ""inside"" gandhi's comments drew criticism from bjp spokesperson pradeep bhandari.

NEW DELHI: Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar had two breakfasts together within a week, but the deadlock over the Karnataka chief ministerial post does not seem likely to end soon.The second round of the ""breakfast diplomacy"" at the deputy chief minister's residence drew a blank yet again, after both Siddaramaiah and DKS left the decision to the party high command.""When the high command says,"" Siddaramaiah responded when asked when Shivakumar would become the chief minister.""So far, there is no communication from the high command on the timeline for any decision on the matter. If they (high command) call us, we will definitely go and meet them. Tomorrow, I will be meeting AICC General Secretary K C Venugopal at a function where both of us are invited,"" he added.Both Congress leaders also put up a united front. The chief minister asserted that there are no differences between him and his deputy, adding that they are running the government like “brothers” and will continue to do so in the future as well.Meanwhile, home minister G Parameshwar, another name in the fray for the CM post, acknowledged the stir and called for a “peaceful settlement.”""It's a good thing that our leaders are getting together again for breakfast. All we want is a peaceful settlement of whatever has happened over the month or so. As suggested by the high command, they are meeting for the second time. All the issues are settled. It is just reciprocal, nothing else,"" Parameshwar said.Additionally, hours after meeting DKS, Siddaramaiah added to the speculation as he was heard saying “politics is not permanent” during an informal conversation with Congress MLA Belur Gopal.Though the context of the conversation — the video of which has gone viral — is unclear, it is being linked to CM change talks in the state.""Whatever has to happen, let it happen. Is politics my father's property? Politics is not permanent,"" Siddaramaiah can be heard telling Gopal Krishna, MLA from Sagara, as they emerged from inside Vidhana Soudha.This comes after the first breakfast between Siddaramaiah and DKS. The outreach comes after the Congress high command nudged both leaders to present a united front ahead of the Belagavi legislature session starting December 8.Earlier, as soon as the Congress government in Karnataka completed its halfway mark on November 20, reports quoting Congress sources suggested that MLAs and MLCs from Shivakumar’s faction had camped in Delhi to push the party high command to make him the next chief minister.DK Shivakumar added to the speculation after he claimed there had indeed been “a confidential understanding on leadership transition among five-six leaders” soon after Congress won a landslide in the 2023 elections.The deputy chief minister made the first reference to the power pact but stopped short of divulging more details. “This is confidential.

On a crisp winter morning, when the sun struggles to cut through a grey, smoky haze, many of us glance at the air-quality index like a daily horoscope, the number that decides whether we mask up, skip a walk, or brace for another day of breathing toxic air. But what do those figures actually mean for our lungs? Why does 200 feel unbearable while 500 feels apocalyptic? And as smoke from stubble burning mixes with vehicular and industrial pollution , what is all that particulate matter really doing inside the body?Here is a look at the mechanics of the AQI, and what a pulmonologist wants you to know before the next toxic plume rolls in.For years, India’s air-quality data was buried in technical charts and numbers, leaving most people unsure of what the readings meant for the air they breathed. Without a clear, accessible system, public engagement with pollution remained limited.To change this, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) set out to create a national Air Quality Index (AQI) that could translate complicated measurements into simple, accessible categories. An expert group, bringing together doctors, air-quality scientists, academics, NGOs, state pollution boards, and technical inputs from IIT Kanpur, developed what eventually became India’s AQI.A draft was released in October 2014 for public and institutional feedback, and after detailed review, the national framework was finalised.The AQI is designed to tell people, at a glance, not just how polluted the air is, but what that level of pollution could mean for their health. It classifies air quality into six categories:. The index accounts for eight major pollutants with 24-hour standards and calculates individual sub-indices for each as long as there is data for at least three pollutants, one of them necessarily PM2.5 or PM10, an AQI can be computed. The highest (or “worst”) sub-index becomes the overall AQI number for that location.The AQI measures key pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Among them, PM2.5 is considered the most harmful because its tiny particles can travel deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, leading to serious health risks. The World Health Organisation (WHO) advises keeping PM2.5 levels below 5 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) annually, and under 15 µg/m³ for 24 hours.The US AQI, like India’s, runs on a 0–500 scale, but with one key difference. Its highest category, “hazardous,” begins at 301 with no upper cap, so readings can go well beyond 500. The two countries also use different formulas to calculate their scores, which means the same pollution data can produce different AQI values. In short, the Indian and US scales don’t line up exactly and can’t be directly compared.Every winter, vast stretches of northern India, from Punjab and Haryana to neighbouring states, witness the burning of leftover crop stubble as farmers clear their fields for the next sowing season. This practice, known as crop residue burning (CRB), remains a persistent environmental challenge in India and many agricultural regions around the world.CRB is a major driver of fine particulate pollution, especially PM2.5, that engulfs Delhi and the wider NCR region each winter. These microscopic particles pose a heightened health threat, not only to residents but also to farmers living in and around the burn sites. Because PM2.5 particles are small enough to penetrate deep into the respiratory system, they can lodge along the delicate lining of the alveoli in the lungs.A growing body of scientific evidence links PM2.5 exposure to significant health risks. Short-term exposure can impair lung function and worsen conditions like asthma and heart disease. Over the long term, the dangers intensify; prolonged inhalation has been associated with chronic bronchitis, reduced lung capacity, and increased mortality linked to lung cancer and cardiovascular illnesses.Delhi has once again topped the charts as India’s most polluted city, according to a decade-long AQI assessment by Climate Trends covering 2015 to November 2025. The analysis shows that no major Indian city has reached safe air-quality levels at any point in the past ten years, underscoring the severity of the national pollution crisis.Delhi remains the worst-hit, followed by Noida, which recorded an alarming AQI of 515. Other heavily polluted regions include Cooch Behar (362), Kishanganj (351), and Kultali (332), reflecting how toxic air has spread far beyond the metros and deep into smaller districts. The data points to a nationwide public-health emergency, with the capital continuing to sit at the centre of India’s pollution burden.Dr Kuldeep Kumar Grover, head of critical care and pulmonology at CK Birla Hospital in Gurugram, says the body reacts almost immediately when pollution levels rise. Fine particles irritate and inflame the airways, leading to coughing, excess mucus, and reduced lung function, while the heart and blood vessels come under added strain due to oxidative stress, constricted vessels, and a heightened tendency for clotting.""The cardiovascular system also responds to pollution by inducing oxidative stress, blood vessel constriction, and an increased tendency toward blood clotting.""At an AQI of around 200, the body experiences noticeable but manageable stress; symptoms like throat irritation, headaches, and breathlessness are common, especially for vulnerable groups. But when levels reach 500, the exposure becomes overwhelming. Inflammation intensifies, asthma can worsen quickly, blood pressure may rise, and even healthy people may struggle with oxygen exchange. Sustained exposure at this severity can lead to acute respiratory or cardiac complications, Dr Grover adds.Surface pollution from stubble burning and urban sources exposes people to PM2.5, PM10 and carbon monoxide, the dominant winter pollutants. The tiniest of these, PM2.5, can slip past the body’s natural defences, lodge deep in the lungs, and even enter the bloodstream. Carrying toxic metals and reactive chemicals, these particles spark chronic inflammation and gradual tissue damage. Over time, doctors see faster loss of lung function, recurring bronchitis, worsening asthma, and higher risks of heart and vascular disease.""Long-term exposure also increases risks of lung cancer, preterm birth, and impaired cognitive development in children. The cumulative effect of this pollution is almost akin to the long-term effects of smoking in some highly polluted regions,"" Dr Grover said.Children, pregnant women, and older adults face greater risks as AQI levels climb because their bodies are more vulnerable to pollution-induced stress. Children breathe faster and have developing lungs, making AQI levels above 150 likely to trigger coughing, wheezing, and fatigue.Pregnant women, who already have reduced oxygen reserves, may experience breathlessness when pollution rises above 200, and prolonged exposure has been linked to complications such as ""low birth weight and preterm labour."" Older adults, especially those with heart or lung conditions, can develop chest tightness, irregular heartbeat, or worsening COPD even at AQI 150–200, said Dr Grover.On the other hand, for people with asthma or chronic bronchitis, polluted air intensifies existing inflammation.Irritants like PM2.5 and ozone narrow the airways, increase mucus, and heighten sensitivity to triggers, leading to more frequent wheezing, coughing, breathlessness, and greater reliance on rescue inhalers. High pollution days also increase the risk of asthma attacks, respiratory infections, and a faster decline in lung function.""Patients should follow their treatment plans closely, avoid outdoor activity at times of peak pollution, and use preventive medication as recommended by their clinician,"" Dr Grover said.On days when air quality plunges into the “very poor” or “severe” range, the most important strategy is reducing total exposure, said Dr Grover.Indoors, keeping windows shut, avoiding smoke or incense, and using a certified HEPA purifier can significantly lower pollutant levels. Outside, it's best to limit activity, especially exercise, which draws particles deeper into the lungs. Only well-fitted N95 or FFP2 masks offer real protection; cloth and surgical masks do little to block PM2.5.Supporting measures like staying hydrated, using nasal saline rinses, and closely monitoring symptoms help reduce irritation. People with chronic lung or heart conditions should keep medications handy and follow their action plans carefully. Avoiding peak pollution hours, typically early mornings and evenings, remains one of the simplest ways to cut exposure.As winter smog thickens and AQI levels swing from unhealthy to severe, the message from experts is clear: pollution is not just an environmental issue but a direct, measurable threat to health.From choosing the right mask to avoiding peak smog hours and protecting vulnerable groups, even small, consistent steps can significantly cut exposure.

Amit Shah Blames Infiltration For Muslim Population Growth, Backs CAA As Moral Responsibility

The Supreme Court on Tuesday took a sharp stance while hearing a habeas corpus plea alleging the custodial disappearance of Rohingya individuals and seeking that any deportation follow due process, asking whether “intruders” should be given a “red carpet welcome,” as reported by LiveLaw. Chief Justice of India Surya Kant, sitting with Justice Joymalya Bagchi, questioned the basis of the plea, asking, ""Where is the order of the Government of India declaring them (Rohingyas) as refugees? Refugee is a well defined legal term… If there is no legal status of a refugee, and somebody is an intruder, and he enters illegally, do we have an obligation to keep that fellow here?""The petitioner’s counsel clarified that no refugee status was being sought -- only that deportation must follow law.LiveLaw quoted the bench saying: ""If they don't have legal status to stay in India… If an intruder comes, do we give them a red carpet welcome saying we would like to give you all facilities? What is the problem in sending them back?""CJI Kant further remarked on illegal entry, saying: ""First you enter, you cross the border illegally… Then you say, now that I have entered, your laws must apply to me… Do we want to stretch the law like this?""","The supreme court on tuesday took a sharp stance while hearing a habeas corpus plea alleging the custodial disappearance of rohingya individuals.

Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

NEW DELHI: What India’s metros are breathing may have a link with rising acute respiratory illness (ARI) cases hospitals are logging. There were 2 lakh ARI cases in Delhi during 2022-24, with thousands needing hospitalisation — a surge the health ministry Tuesday linked to rising air pollution, while noting that the causal pathways remain complex.Responding to a question by Dr Vikramjit Singh Sahney in RS, junior health minister Prataprao Jadhav said polluted air is a “triggering factor” for respiratory diseases, and worsening air quality in urban centres is being closely monitored through an expanding national surveillance system.India’s metro hospitals have recorded over 2 lakh acute respiratory illness (ARI) cases in Delhi alone between 2022 and 2024, with thousands requiring admission each year — a surge the Ministry of Health on Tuesday linked to rising air pollution, while noting that the causal pathways remain complex. Responding to a question by Dr Vikramjit Singh Sahney in the Rajya Sabha, minister of state for health Prataprao Jadhav said polluted air is a “triggering factor” for respiratory diseases, and worsening air quality in urban centres is being closely monitored through an expanding national surveillance system.Govt data shows that Delhi’s six central hospitals together reported 67,054 ARI emergency cases in 2022, 69,293 in 2023, and 68,411 in 2024, with admissions rising from 9,878 to 10,819 over the same period.Similar spikes were seen in Chennai and Mumbai, where thousands sought emergency care for breathing difficulties during severe pollution episodes. According to the Health Ministry, the impact of polluted air is shaped by multiple factors — including food habits, occupation, socio-economic conditions, immunity and medical history — making some people far more vulnerable than others.To capture these patterns in real time, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) now operates over 230 sentinel surveillance sites across 30 States and UTs. Digital ARI surveillance was also launched in August 2023 through the Integrated Health Information Portal.Adding to the evidence, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recently completed a multi-site study across five hospitals involving 33,213 ER patients with respiratory symptoms. The study found that as pollution levels rose, emergency visits for respiratory distress increased. However, the Ministry stressed that the study cannot formally prove causation, even though the association is strong and consistent with global findings.","India’s metro hospitals have recorded over 2 lakh acute respiratory illness (ari) cases in delhi alone between 2022 and 2024.

Marking a Political Milestone, Nitish Kumar Sworn In as Bihar CM for the 10th Time

PATNA: BJP’s Prem Kumar, who won the Gaya Town assembly seat for a record ninth time in the recent Bihar elections, was unanimously elected assembly speaker on Tuesday, succeeding his party colleague Nand Kishore Yadav.Kumar, 70, was the only one who had filed a nomination for the post. Slogans of “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” and “Jai Shri Ram” were raised in the House soon after he was declared “unanimously elected” by voice vote.Having bagged the speaker’s post just days after securing the key home portfolio, held by CM Nitish Kumar for nearly 20 years, BJP has further tightened its grip over the NDA govt in Bihar.The speaker’s role has become increasingly crucial in the state, which has witnessed repeated changes in govts over the past eight years owing to unpredictable shifts in political alliances.JDU minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, however, dismissed the suggestion that the party had been stripped of the speaker’s post. “When did we have the post that we lost it?” Choudhary, said to reporters.

The toll during SIR duty in Uttar Pradesh has now risen to nine in the past 11 days, including three suicides. Despite the rising toll, the chief electoral office of UP has not issued any formal response.Kamal Kant was an assistant teacher at a govt primary school in Nawali Lalpur under Sikandrao police station limits. He lost consciousness before leaving home and was declared dead at a hospital. His wife, Neelam Sharma, who was at her parents’ home, said, “My husband on the phone said to me that they are giving me tension and bothering me. I told him not to take tension.” DM Atu Vats and SP Chiranjeeb Nath Sinha visited the family.Vats said the body had been sent for post-mortem and the cause of death would be confirmed only after the report.“We received information at around 11am that a BLO, who was unwell, died on the way to the hospital. The entire team reached here. It appears that he had a previous medical condition.”Officials said Kant’s SIR performance was satisfactory and that he had already achieved over 50% of his assigned target. He had reportedly taken medication for low blood pressure earlier that morning before collapsing.

Confine your arguments to the legal issues (raised in your petition) to challenge the validity of SIR,” the bench said.Bhushan said SIR was a ruse for EC’s game plan to verify citizenship of residents in constituencies across country.He said citizenship is determined by a competent authority under ministry of home affairs and that EC has no role in this exercise.Earlier in the day, advocate Ashwini Kumar Uadhyay had alleged there were repeated instances of assault and use of criminal force to intimidate BLOs engaged in SIR work in Bengal and other states, and sought a direction from SC to allow EC to requisition the armed forces and state police for preparation of a correct voter list. The bench said, “EC and authorities are competent to take appropriate steps in this regard. ”Advocate Vrinda Grover mirrored advocate A M Singhvi, who appeared for Congress general secretary K C Venugopal, TMC MP Mahua Moitra and other petitioners, that SIR was unconstitutional as EC is conducting it following a process which is neither prescribed under RP Act nor in the conduct of election rules.",‘association for democratic reforms’ counsel prashant bhushan referred to ec as a ‘despot’ a bench of cji surya kant and justice joymalya bagchi immediately cautioned bhushan not to deviate from his legal pleadings.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125730698,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-279710,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Since the two sets of personnel have been assigned different kinds of work and there is no overlap, neither SIR nor local bodies elections would get impacted, he said.Kerala SEC, which is conducting the local bodies elections, also informed the bench that there had been no hiccups in the ongoing process and that on conclusion of elections on Dec 13, the personnel assigned for the purpose will be free to resume their official duties.Singh said since EC and SEC are experiencing no problem in conducting SIR and local bodies polls simultaneously, Kerala govt should not have any problem either.

NEW DELHI: Opposition has expressed glee that it “forced” the governing BJP to accept its demand for a discussion on SIR in Parliament, amid relief that the decision has averted the washout of another session, a prospect that was set to test the unity of INDIA bloc given the murmurs against a blockade.Congress whip Manickam Tagore sounded a triumphant note, saying, “INDIA wins. Arrogance finally bows to the unity of 240 & 100 MPs...” But beneath the claim of victory was a feeling of ease as opposition MPs were worried that a prolonged deadlock, even if forced by “govt intransigence”, would cost them floor time to take up the cause of their constituents.The meeting of opposition representatives on Monday saw some of these concerns being raised by smaller parties, while at least one big party made ambivalent remarks over blockade of proceedings — a reason why opposition decided to protest for two days and take stock of the situation again on Wednesday.RSP MP NK Premachandran said it was good that the deadlock had been resolved but added that govt could have done this much earlier. “Better late than never,” he remarked.The two-day discussion will now see regional parties like Samajwadi Party, DMK, Trinamool Congress, apart from Congress, lead the charge against SIR and, it is asserted, expose govt and Election Commission over the revision of poll rolls that they allege is “exclusionary”.The difference among regional parties is that while DMK, CPM & TMC govern their states, SP is in opposition in UP, though it did well in Lok Sabha polls, besting the governing BJP, and is now worried that deletion of voters would target its support base. That means attention would be more on Akhilesh Yadav, who leads a large contingent of 37 MPs and is expected to mount the offensive.Sparks are set to fly as BJP and allies would use their recent Bihar election sweep to debunk opposition’s allegations against SIR, focussing on “Vote Adhikar Yatra” taken out by Rahul Gandhi along with RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav. In that sense, it would be interesting to see if RJD is able to make a case against SIR post-polls.","Congress whip manickam tagore sounded a triumphant note, saying, “india wins.

Cong slams govt ‘arrogance’, Rijiju blames oppn for logjam

NEW DELHI: The govt Tuesday relented to opposition parties’ unanimous demand for a debate in Parliament on SIR, albeit under the broader subject of election reforms, as the two sides reached an agreement to rule out the grim prospect of another session washout.The govt prevailed on the opposition to first take up a discussion on Vande Mataram in Lok Sabha on Dec 8. The debate on election reforms will take place on Dec 9, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said, adding that 10 hours each have been allotted for the two debates, with the possibility of extension. Sources said PM Narendra Modi is expected to initiate the special discussion on the 150th anniversary of India’s national song, an innate component of the governing BJP’s cultural agenda.Though the debate will be held under the anodyne head of “electoral reforms”, it will focus on the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, pitting opposition’s “vote chori” charge against the governing side’s “protection of infiltrators for vote bank considerations” accusation.The breakthrough was reached at a meeting of floor leaders of all parties with Speaker Om Birla after the opposition’s disruptions to push its demand led to the adjournment of LS, like it did on Monday, the first day of Parliament’s winter sessionOpposition parties staged a walkout from Rajya Sabha after Kiren Rijiju conveyed the govt’s willingness for the discussion, but offered no timing and proposed that the Vande Mataram debate be taken up first.He said, “Vande Mataram is a matter related to our freedom struggle. Matters related to electoral reforms are also extremely important. Considering that opposition parties have united to raise one issue, the govt is ready to take up a discussion, but to have it before the discussion on Vande Mataram may not be appropriate.”Opposition MPs demanded prioritising the SIR debate as “people are dying”, with Leader of Opposition in RS Mallikarjun Kharge jabbing the govt by saying, “Vande Mataram comes from us not from them”. To this, RS chairman C P Radhakrishnan was quick to say, “Vande Mataram is for everyone”.As the deadlock was broken, Congress claimed a win, saying the govt’s arrogance had finally bowed to the unity of opposition parties. Its chief whip in Lok Sabha Manickam Tagore said, “One full monsoon session was washed out because of this. Two days of the winter session already wasted. Democracy is not a playground for diversion — it demands accountability.”Rijiju, however, blamed the opposition’s insistence on a debate on SIR for the logjam, insisting that the govt was always open to a discussion on a subject with wider scope. SIR is an administrative work of Election Commission, an autonomous body, that cannot be discussed in Parliament, but the legislature can always cover the agenda of election reforms, he told reporters.During its meetings with the govt as the winter session began, the opposition had proposed that a discussion can be taken up under any subject with wider dimensions that will allow it to speak on the ongoing SIR and the govt had agreed to consider its demand. The opposition is up in arms against the ongoing SIR in 12 states and UTs, including WB and TN where its constituents are in office and polls are due in the first half of 2026, alleging suicides by BLOs due to workload and irregularities aimed at deleting votes of targeted segments of population.The governing NDA’s morale has received a big boost after notching up a big win in Bihar. The Congress-RJD-Left coalition had strongly opposed SIR in its campaign before the polling was announced, with Rahul Gandhi leading a long yatra alleging a BJP-EC nexus for “vote chori”. However, it failed to draw much traction and the combine slumped to one of the worst losses a vanquished coalition has ever suffered in Bihar.","The govt prevailed on the opposition to first take up a discussion on vande mataram in lok sabha on dec 8.
