Wettest monsoon in north India in 12 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wettest-monsoon-in-north-india-in-12-years/articleshow/123534949.cms,"ANI file photo

NEW DELHI: At 21% above normal, north India has so far recorded its wettest monsoon since 2013, the year of the cataclysmic Kedarnath flash flood. Worryingly, in Aug, the region has experienced by far the highest number of 'extremely heavy' rain events since the India Meteorological Department (IMD) began collating this data in 2021.Till Aug 25, north India had logged 21 extremely heavy rain events, a 50% rise over the previous highest of 14 recorded last year, even though that month had registered higher rainfall. The number of such events is likely to rise further by the end of the month, making this Aug's monsoon among the most destructive in the region in recent years.'Extremely heavy' is IMD's highest category of daily rainfall recorded at a weather station, defined as over 204.5mm in 24 hours.This monsoon, north India is the only one among India's four regions to register a rain surplus in all three months (June, July, Aug) of the season so far - another first for the North since 2013.""In the last two months, northwest India (IMD nomenclature for north India) has seen high rainfall activity mainly because of frequent interactions between western disturbances and monsoon currents from Bay of Bengal and sometimes from Arabian Sea.When these two currents meet over the region, a lot of rain takes place,"" said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, IMD chief.North India (or northwest India) is a meteorological region comprising states/UTs of J&K, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, UP and Rajasthan. Mohapatra said most of the extreme rain events in north India had taken place in the two hill states and the UT of J&K.The extreme rainfall data for the region reveals that while Aug last year had more 'heavy' (64.4-115.5mm) and 'very heavy' (115.5-204.4mm) rain events, it recorded far less number of 'extremely heavy' rainfall episodes than Aug this year. Last year, north India had reported its wettest month of Aug in 28 years since 1996, with the region as a whole logging 256.4mm of rain. The current month has so far (till Aug 26) reported 209.4mm, with five days still to go.""Due to formation of a trough in eastern Pakistan, the region has received a lot of rain in the past four days. The spell is likely to continue for one or two more days,"" Mohapatra said.The last three days have been the wettest in north India this monsoon season, with August 25 alone logging 21.8mm of rain, four times higher than the normal of 5.6mm for the day.","At 21% above normal, north india has so far recorded its wettest monsoon since 2013.

HCs yet to comply with SC's timeline on reserved verdicts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hcs-yet-to-comply-with-scs-timeline-on-reserved-verdicts/articleshow/123534915.cms,"New Delhi: Supreme Court may have fixed timeline for the President and the governors for taking a decision on bills passed by state assemblies, but has not been able over nearly 24 years to get high courts to comply with its 2001 judgment laying guidelines on speedier pronouncement of verdicts reserved in cases.In 2001, SC in Anil Rai case noticed the troubling practice among HC judges reserving verdicts only to forget to pronounce judgments or pronounce only operating portions of the verdict with a promise to provide detailed reasons later, which in some cases went abegging.To eradicate the anomaly of keeping judgments reserved for months and in some cases years, SC laid down five-point guidelines that mandated the chief justices of HCs to remind the judges if they had not pronounced decisions within two months of reserving the verdict. SC also allowed the litigants to apply for early pronouncement of a judgment, if it was not delivered within three months of reserving it.The non-implementation of the guidelines was noticed on Monday by a bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and Prashant Kumar Mishra, who were shocked to discover that an Allahabad HC bench has not delivered judgment for almost a year.Justice Mishra said, ""In most of HCs, there is no mechanism where the litigant can approach the concerned bench or the chief justice bringing to its notice the delay in delivery of judgment.In such a situation, the litigant loses his faith in the judicial process defeating the ends of justice.""While reiterating the guidelines for expeditious pronouncement of judgment by HCs as laid down in 2001, the bench said, ""If the judgment is not delivered within three months, Registrar General shall place the matters before the CJ for orders and the CJ shall bring it to the notice of the concerned bench for pronouncing the order within two weeks thereafter, failing which the matter be assigned to another bench.""Significantly, the problem is not restricted to HCs. SC has been unable to find the cure for the same problem within its own houses, with too many instances of judgments having been reserved for months. Justice A S Oka delivered the judgment on a long pending dispute between two factions of ISKCON after keeping it reserved for almost a year.","Supreme court has not been able over nearly 24 years to get high courts to comply with its 2001 judgment laying guidelines on speedier pronouncement of verdicts reserved in cases.

Shadow schooling booming as 33% of kids take private coaching: Government report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shadow-schooling-booming-as-33-of-kids-take-private-coaching-government-report/articleshow/123534882.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Nearly one in three school students in India now takes private coaching, with the practice far more common in urban areas, according to latest Comprehensive Modular Survey (CMS) on education released by govt. The findings sketch a system where government schools remain central in rural India while urban families increasingly prefer private schools and supplement classroom learning with paid coaching.The survey, carried out by ministry of statistics and programme implementation as part of 80th round of the National Sample Survey, covered over 52,000 households and nearly 58,000 students to assess household expenditure on schooling and tutoring.Govt schools still dominate nationally, accounting for 55.9% of enrolments, but their reach is stronger in villages, where two-thirds of children study. In cities, only 30.1% attend govt schools, with parents showing a clear preference for private unaided institutions. Private schools account for almost a third of enrolments nationwide, with their share particularly significant in urban areas, where higher incomes and aspirations drive choice.The financial gap is stark. Families with children in govt schools spend on average Rs 2,863 per student annually, while those in non-govt schools spend nearly nine times more at Rs 25,002. Only a quarter of govt school students reported paying course fees, compared to 95.7% in private schools, rising to 98% in urban unaided institutions. Across categories - fees, uniforms and books - urban families spend far more, with average course fees at Rs 15,143 per student against Rs 3,979 in rural households.Private coaching has become a major burden. The survey found 27% of students took coaching this year, rising to 30.7% in urban areas and 25.5% in rural. City households spend an average Rs 3,988 per child annually, rural families Rs 1,793. At higher secondary, city families spend Rs 9,950 per student, twice rural average of Rs 4,548. Coaching costs climb steadily, from Rs 525 at pre-primary to Rs 6,384 at higher secondary.The survey also highlighted how education is financed. Across India, 95% of students said the main source of funding was household members. Govt scholarships were cited by just 1.2%.What emerges is a dual narrative - government schools remain backbone of rural education, while urban parents lean toward private institutions and coaching. This twin trend of private schooling and shadow education reflects both aspirations and inequalities at a time when NEP seeks equitable & affordable access to quality education.","Nearly one in three school students in india now takes private coaching.

MYSURU: A 25-year-old man was detained in connection with the mysterious murder of a woman in a lodge room in Saligrama taluk, Mysuru district, Saturday.According to police, the 20-year-old woman, married and has a two-year-old child, was found with her mouth and right part of her face ripped open in what seemed to be a controlled blast triggered by an unidentified device. When police arrived, Darshitha was found dead in a pool of blood on the floor of the hotel room in Bherya village, 55km from Mysuru city.Police claimed the suspect, Siddaraju, from Bettadapura in Periyapatna, had brought Darshitha from Hunsur's Gerasanahalli to visit a temple. He allegedly plotted the murder of Darshitha as she refused to marry him, according to police. They reportedly knew each other for 7 years. Siddaraju worked at a hardware shop, while she lived with her parents at Gerasanahalli. Her husband lives in Kerala.Police suspect the accused may have used a pressure-triggering object or electricity to kill her. It's suspected Siddaraju may have electrocuted her by forcibly inserting a cable into her mouth and turning the power switch on, as a two-metre electric cable was recovered from the spot.Siddaraju allegedly attempted to carry Darshitha's body on his shoulder.The hotel staff asked him not to move the body until police arrived, police stated.Mysuru superintendent of police N Vishnuvardhana said police are being assisted by a forensic science expert to identify the object used to kill the woman. He ruled out the use of gelatine sticks or any combustible materials to injure and kill the woman. An investigation is being carried out to identify the object used to cause her severe bleeding in her mouth, which resulted in her death.According to lodge manager Manu, the duo arrived seeking a room around 2pm Saturday. Siddaraju introduced Darshitha as his wife. He went out to get food, returned with a parcel in a plastic cover about 30 minutes later and claimed the room was locked from inside.Immediately, lodge staff force-opened the door. To their shock, they found Darshitha dead in a pool of blood.Manu appeared to suggest it was a mysterious blast since there was no sound of an explosion and there were no traces of gunpowder inside the room.","A 25-year-old man was detained in connection with the mysterious murder of a woman in a lodge room in mysuru district.

'Couple had a heated row just before incident'

Noida: The investigation into the death of 26-year-old Nikki Bhati, in which her husband Vipin is the prime accused and has been charged with murder, has taken a turn. CCTV footage that emerged on Monday purportedly shows Vipin standing at a grocery shop outside their Greater Noida house at the time when Nikki was allegedly attacked on Aug 21 evening.The footage, from a shop diagonally opposite from the Bhati house in Sirsa village, has prompted police to revisit the timeline and scrutinise videos of the alleged assault shared by Nikki's family. These videos, including one in which Nikki is seen purportedly staggering down the stairs with her torso on fire, were taken by her sister Kanchan, who lives in the same house and is married to Vipin's younger brother Rohit.On Monday, police made two more arrests, taking into custody Vipin's father Satveer and Rohit, both of whom had been absconding since the alleged murder.Vipin and his mother Daya were arrested on Sunday. Vipin, who allegedly tried to flee cops while he was being taken to the crime scene, was shot in the leg in an encounter.The time stamp on the footage from the camera that purportedly shows Vipin and his six-year-old son standing on the road puts him at the grocery store at the time of the alleged assault, which - according to the complaint from Nikki's family and the time recorded on the video shared by Kanchan of Nikki engulfed in flames - is 5.45pm, police sources said.In the CCTV clip, the man, believed to be Vipin wearing a check shirt and blue trousers, is seen standing near a white car parked on the main road outside the house at 5.42pm. A boy joins him, apparently holding a rope that he tugs several times. The man lingers, glancing down the road and chatting with two or three boys. Suddenly, at 5.47pm, a commotion appears to erupt. The man in the check shirt sprints towards the house, followed closely by an older man who also rushes inside. Moments later, the younger man emerges again, gesturing to bystanders who gather. He is seen talking to a man in shorts as the crowd swells. At 5.48pm, the man gets into the white car, briefly steps out, and then reverses the vehicle into the lane as more people gather.Devendra, Vipin's cousin, claimed that Nikki suffered burns from a cylinder blast in the kitchen. ""The shop where Vipin is standing is opposite their house. I heard Vipin shouting about rushing Nikki to hospital. Everyone was shouting about Nikki being injured in a fire. If you see the footage, you'll see me walking out of my shop in shorts after Vipin. I downed the shutters and drove the car. Along with uncle and aunty (Daya and Satveer), I took Nikki to hospital. She told us there was a cylinder blast inside the house and kept asking for water all the way to the hospital as she couldn't breathe. We took her to Fortis Hospital, where she also told the doctor about a cylinder blast,"" he said.A senior officer said the timing of the footage and that of videos shared by Nikki's family need to be matched. ""We will cross-check a few things, especially the time span. We are anyway verifying the contents of the footage and the video handed over to us by Kanchan as the main evidence. Footage from the hospital where Nikki was taken to initially needs to be examined too,"" he told TOI.Devendra's version conflicts with that of Kanchan, who alleged her sister was set on fire. In one of the videos posted by Kanchan on her YouTube channel, Vipin is seen dragging Nikki by the hair and taunting her to ""make a video"". Another brief video shows Nikki engulfed in flames. According to Vipin's relatives, the clips are from last winter, not Aug 21.Police said they would probe all possibilities, including dowry harassment, domestic violence and suicide. ""The accused, the husband, father-in-law, mother-in-law and brother-in-law, have all been arrested,"" said Sudhir Kumar, additional DCP, Greater Noida.Investigators have learned that tension started after Nikki and Kanchan opened a beauty parlour at home. The family allegedly opposed the venture, but Nikki persisted. Relations deteriorated further in 2024 after Nikki discovered Vipin's affair with a woman from Jarcha, who later filed a police case against him for physical abuse. In the days leading up to Nikki's death, the couple was not on talking terms, living in separate rooms, sources said. ""The couple had a heated argument minutes before the incident, during which Vipin allegedly slapped Nikki several times,"" a police source said.","Cctv footage purportedly shows vipin standing at a grocery shop outside their greater noida house at the time when nikki was allegedly attacked.

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate on Tuesday searched the premises of former minister Saurabh Bharadwaj and others as part of a money laundering probe linked to an alleged scam in health infrastructure projects during the previous AAP government in Delhi, official sources said.At least 13 locations, including those of some private contractors and commercial real estate developers, in the National Capital Region are being searched under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), they said.The ED investigation against Bharadwaj (45), Delhi AAP unit chief and national spokesperson for his party, stems from an FIR registered by Delhi's Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) in June.The ACB booked Bharadwaj, his party colleague and ex-health minister Satyendar Jain, private contractors and unknown government officials for alleged corruption in health infrastructure projects by the AAP government led by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.After the filing of the ACB's FIR, the AAP alleged blatant misuse of agencies to defame its leaders.The ACB complaint came after the Delhi BJP alleged in August last year ""grave irregularities and suspected corruption in various health infrastructure projects under the Delhi government"".The ACB complaint alleged ""systematic manipulation of project budgets, misuse of public funds and collusion with private contractors"".It alleged that during 2018-19, 24 hospital projects worth Rs 5,590 crore were sanctioned. However, these projects remained largely incomplete, with substantial and unexplained cost escalations.Similarly, the Rs 1,125-crore ICU Hospital Project, covering seven pre-engineered facilities with a total of 6,800 beds, is only 50 per cent complete after nearly three years and an expenditure of Rs 800 crore, despite an initial six-month completion timeline, according to ACB officials.AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal took to X to allege that the BJP-led Centre was misusing probe agencies to silence the opposition.AAP leader Atishi also posted on X, questioning, “Why was a raid conducted at Saurabh ji’s place today?”ED officials said the searches are based on material collected during the course of investigation and allegations contained in the FIR regarding large-scale corruption, unjustified cost escalations, unauthorised constructions and misappropriation of funds in health infrastructure projects of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD).","The ed investigation against bharadwaj (45) stems from an fir registered by delhi's anti-corruption branch (acb) in june.

Is there merit in this criticism against ED?

What SC had said about ED

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah 's ""morality pitch"" to back the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill, 2025 met a strong counter from Rajya Sabha member Kapil Sibal who accused the Modi government of ""weaponising"" laws to target the opposition.""I don't think in the history of India, there has been a government which is more constitutionally immoral than this government. Can the home minister talk about constitutional morality after the way the governments in Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Karnataka, Goa and Madhya Pradesh, among other places, were toppled,"" Sibal claimed. ""You can fool some people sometimes but you cannot fool all the people all the time,"" the Independent Rajya Sabha member added.On the last day of the Monsoon Session of Parliament, Amit Shah had introduced the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill - which proposes automatic removal of Prime Minister, chief ministers and ministers if they are arrested and detained for 30 consecutive days on charges punishable by five years or more imprisonment. The three bills - Government of Union Territories (Amendment) Bill 2025; the Constitution (One Hundred And Thirtieth Amendment) Bill 2025; and the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill 2025 - were referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee.Amit Shah strongly defended the bills stating they were aimed at upholding ""constitutional morality"" and public trust. The Union home minister also emphasised that the bills, would apply equally to all leaders, including those from the ruling party.However, his assurances failed to convince the opposition. Sibal reacted sharply to Shah's remarks and claimed that ""constitutional morality has nothing to do with their own morality"" and has everything to do with the morality of the opposition.""I was surprised by the home minister’s (Amit Shah) remark that the bill was introduced for morality. The home minister should stop talking about morality and tell the public if any BJP government minister has been arrested and jailed even for a day,"" he said.Earlier, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge had alleged that the BJP planned to use the Bills to engage in ""satta chori"" so that it could ""topple opposition governments within 30 days"" and ""destabilise"" democracy by using arrest as a weapon.So, why is the opposition against the proposed legislation?The opposition claims the proposed law can be used as a tool to bring down non-BJP governments. Sibal claimed that no minister in the BJP governments at the Centre or in states have been arrested in the last 10 years while probe agencies had targeted opposition leaders one after the another.The former Union law minister cited the examples of AAP leaders Arvind Kejriwal, Satyendar Jain and Manish Sisodia, the Congress' P Chidambaram, D K Shivakumar and Alamgir Alam, and JMM's Hemant Soren, among others, saying they had been arrested for over a month and then got bail much later, with the trial not concluding even after years.""No trial is complete. The home minister knows that when the PMLA and CBI get after them, nobody is granted bail. Even the Supreme Court had remarked -- why trial courts are not granting bail. And in the meantime, your political career is destroyed. The whole purpose of these laws is to weaponise laws for destabilising governments of opposition parties,"" Sibal alleged.NCP (SP) leader Rohit Pawar fears the Bill would be misused to target politicians of opposition parties. ""The government uses investigative agencies like the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for political vendetta rather than genuine anti-corruption efforts. There are many BJP leaders on whom we have proved corruption, but the government is doing nothing about it,"" the NCP(SP)leader says and adds: ""98 per cent of the ED's actions are targeted against the opposition. It's no longer an independent body, it’s working on behalf of the government. It was expected to work against corruption across the board, not just the opposition,"" the NCP(SP) leader said.Pending cases against non-BJP ministers and ex-chief ministers:Sibal cited these examples to slam Amit Shah’s claim of speedy justice in matters related to jailed ministers.In March this year, the Union government had informed Parliament that the ED had registered 193 cases against political leaders over the past ten years. Of these, just two cases led to convictions, while no case resulted in an acquittal on merits.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-2-convictions-in-193-ed-cases-against-politicians-in-10-years-centre/articleshow/119217677.cmsAccording to the data, the highest number of such cases, 32, were lodged between April 2022 and March 2023. The second highest, 27, were recorded between April 2020 and March 2021, and again between April 2023 and March 2024. Additionally, 26 cases were registered in both 2019-2020 and 2021-2022.The government, however, denied any vendetta and said: ""The financial crimes probe agency takes up cases “based on credible material and not political affiliations, religion or otherwise.”The Supreme Court had earlier this year made some very strong observations about the functioning of the Enforcement Directorate. The top court had reminded the central agency that it must function strictly within the bounds of the law and said: ""You can’t act like a crook.""Highlighting concerns about the agency’s low conviction rate, Justice Ujjal Bhuyan had said: ""You can't act like a crook, you have to act within the four corners of the law. I observed in one of my judgments that ED has registered around 5,000 ECIRs (enforcement case information report) in the past five years but the conviction rate is less than 10 per cent. We are also concerned about ED’s image. After 5–6 years of custody, if people are acquitted, who takes responsibility?”While the government's intent of not allowing politicians to run governments from jail is indeed praiseworthy, the track record of investigative agencies, especially the ED, gives credence to opposition claims that the proposed legislation will be used to target them. What's more - the opposition claims that the BJP can use these Bills to target even its allies - Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar - in future.(With inputs from agencies)","The opposition claims the proposed law can be used as a tool to bring down non-bjp governments.

India Had Planes Before Wright Brothers: Shivraj Sparks Debate After Anurag's 'Astronaut' Hanuman

NEW DELHI: Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Tuesday sidestepped questions about the possibility of him becoming the next BJP president, saying his focus in entirely on boosting agricultural production and improving farmers' income.When asked about his reported meeting with RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat in New Delhi over the past weekend sparking speculation about a potential BJP president candidacy, Chouhan reiterated that he was focused on his ministerial duties, news agency PTI reported.""I want to say one thing -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi has entrusted me with the responsibility of looking after ministries of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare and Rural Development. At this moment, agriculture is in every pore of my body and farmers are in my breath,” Chouhan said.He added that, like the eyes of a bird, he had only one goal: to increase agricultural production, boost farmers’ income, develop rural areas and create more Lakhpati Didis.A Lakhpati Didi refers to a member of a self-help group (SHG) whose household earns over Rs 1 lakh annually.When pressed further about the BJP president post, Chouhan said, “Neither have I ever thought of it, nor has anyone told me. I can't even think of it.I am the Agriculture and Rural Development Minister. I am doing this work like worship. Serving farmers is worship of God for me and I want to keep doing this worship.”Chouhan, 66, a prominent OBC leader, has served as chief minister of Madhya Pradesh four times and is known for his strong grassroots connect.After leading the BJP to a decisive victory in the November 2023 Madhya Pradesh assembly elections, he resigned from the state assembly and won the 2024 Lok Sabha polls from Vidisha, subsequently joining Prime Minister Modi’s third-term Cabinet.The three-year term of the current BJP president, JP Nadda, had ended around two years ago. His tenure was extended later.","Union agriculture minister shivraj singh chouhan sidestepped questions about the possibility of him becoming the next bjp president.

Elevating Patna HC CJ will be counter-productive: SC judge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/elevating-patna-hc-cj-will-be-counter-productive-sc-judge/articleshow/123534855.cms,"New Delhi: Supreme Court judge Justice B V Nagarathna has strongly dissented against the collegium's decision to elevate Patna high court chief justice Vipul Manubhai Pancholi to the top court, saying the move would be ""counter-productive"" to the judiciary.The five-member collegium, comprising CJI B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, J K Maheshwari and Nagarathna, had on Aug 25 recommended names of Bombay HC chief justice Alok Aradhe and Justice Pancholi for elevation as SC judges. Justice Pancholi, if appointed, would be in line to become CJI in Oct 2031 after Justice Joymalya Bagchi's retirement.Justice Nagarathna, the sole woman judge in SC, opposed the move citing Pancholi's lower seniority and circumstances surrounding his transfer from Gujarat HC to Patna HC in July 2023. She noted that the transfer was ""not a routine one, but a carefully considered decision taken after consultation with several senior judges, all of whom concurred"".According to sources, she also underlined concerns about regional representation in SC and warned that going ahead with Pancholi's elevation could erode ""whatever credibility collegium system still holds"". Her dissent reportedly traces back to May when Pancholi's name was first considered.At that stage, Justice N V Anjaria was elevated ahead of him. When Pancholi's name resurfaced three months later, Nagarathna recorded her dissent.The development has triggered sharp reactions outside the court as well. NGO Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reforms (CJAR) issued a statement saying the August 25 resolution ""makes a mockery of the earlier standards of transparency in judicial appointments"". It noted that the collegium had taken a 4-1 split decision in recommending Pancholi and questioned why he was chosen despite being only 57th in the all-India seniority list of HC judges.The CJAR statement also pointed out that Pancholi would be the third judge from Gujarat to be elevated to Supreme Court, which it said was ""disproportionate to the size of Gujarat HC"" while several other HCs remain unrepresented.Justice Nagarathna's dissent, the first against a proposed CJI-designate in recent years, has once again brought the collegium system and its credibility under sharp public focus.
