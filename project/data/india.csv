Yunus’s special assistant ‘asked to’ resign

The interim govt is set to introduce a special law by next week aimed at accelerating efforts to recover billions of dollars allegedly siphoned off from Bangladesh to foreign countries. In the absence of aparliament session, the law will be enacted through an ordinance, said chief adviser Yunus Muhammad’s press secretary Shafiqul Alam.Referring to govt’s white paper on the state of the economy, Alam said approximately $234 billion was siphoned off during the Hasina administration from 2009 to 2024. Additionally, an estimated $17 billion was stolen from the banking system. He added, govt is currently investigating 11 prominent individuals and companies, including former PM Hasina and her family members.A meeting was held with the 11-member task force, which was established in Sept last year. According to Alam, the task force has already engaged with around 200 law firms and may enter agreements with about 30 internationally known firms to expedite the recovery process.Muhammad Yunus’ special assistant M Aminul Islam resigned from his position on Monday, reportedly after being “asked to do so” by the chief adviser’s office. Aminul was tasked with assisting the education adviser. Meanwhile, the govt appointed Anisuzzaman Chowdhury as a special assistant to the chief adviser, who will oversee issues tied to the finance ministry, and his status will be that of a state minister.",Yunus muhammad’s special assistant ‘asked to’ resign from his position. $234 billion was siphoned off during the hasina administration from 2009 to 2024.

BJP vs DMK

Clash began after DMK MP claimed TN funds ‘diverted’

NEW DELHI: The Modi govt and DMK clashed on the first day of the resumed Budget session , with the latter questioning the govt over the three-language policy and education minister Dharmendra Pradhan accusing the Tamil Nadu govt and the governing party of going back on their commitment to sign the MoU for NEP.The minister attacked DMK with strong words, claiming that TN was ready to implement NEP but reversed its stand because of pressure from some ‘super CM’, and accused the party of being undemocratic and anti-students, leading to protests and a couple of adjournments. He later withdrew his remark on Speaker Om Birla’s initiative, and was expunged. In the evening, DMK filed a privilege motion against Pradhan, accusing him of misleading the House and tarnishing the image of Tamil Nadu.DMK MP K Kanimozhi, in the privilege notice, also alleged that the minister’s conduct attacked her dignity as a woman, and “his indecent remarks” constituted an outrage to modesty and harassment, while sending a “harmful message” that any female member can be attacked verbally, humiliated and harassed.DMK MPs disrupted the proceedings during question hour, opposing the Centre’s three-language policy and linking of the implementation of NEP as a pre-condition for release of central grants. Congress MPs, too, joined DMK, against Pradhan’s remarks. Under NEP, every state has to sign an MoU in order to receive central funds for infrastructure upgrades and other financial assistance.With language policy and delimitation on top of its agenda, DMK used legislative proceedings on the first day to hammer home its talking points, with even the “lading bill” becoming a platform for sniping at BJP. DMK MP Kalanidhi Veeraswamy, speaking on the legislation, caustically said there did not seem to be an equivalent of “lading” in Hindi, because govt had not changed the name of the bill from its earlier version — echoing DMK’s complaint that Modi govt has enacted laws without the customary English titles like the three criminal laws. Veeraswamy said govt should consider Tamils as a part of India. Citing a Tamil proverb, he went on to say that Tamils consider every person in contact as their relatives, but the treasury benches “treat us” as enemies and not political foes.The clash started after DMK MP T Sumathy said around Rs 2,000 crore originally meant for TN for PM-SHRI has been diverted to other states due to its opposition to NEP. She said Centre was using financial allocation for school education as a vengeful tool against the state.During the clash, the Speaker was infuriated at certain remarks made by DMK’s Dayanidhi Maran, who had trooped into the well shouting slogans against the govt. Birla dared Maran to repeat the same words on record from his seat, and action would be taken against him. Birla also urged the treasury benches to bring a motion against Maran’s remarks against the Chair. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju immediately rose to condemn Maran’s behaviour, and promised to bring a related motion.Pradhan said Centre was ready with the funds, but the state must sign an MoU by March 15 to implement NEP. He said Kanimozhi was aware that TN was ready to sign the MoU. “Let her be honest to people of Tamil Nadu that she only came to know today. Their higher education minister wrote to us. They are dishonest... It is unfortunate in democracy. They are trying to cover up their failure and doing politics,” he said.",Clash began after dmk mp claimed tn funds ‘diverted’ to other states.

CAG-itated politics: How audit reports upend political fortunes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cag-itated-politics-how-audit-reports-upend-political-fortunes/articleshow/118809663.cms,"The scam that wasn't



'Conscience' shaking scam



Congress and CAG not meant for each other



NEW DELHI: Political parties and CAG reports have shared a hot and cold relationship in Indian politics over the decades. Interestingly, the two become quite inseparable when the elections approach. Delhi witnessed this recently when audit report of exorbitant spending on CM's official residence, injected into public consciousness as 'sheeshmahal' scam, was one of the key reasons that helped the Bharatiya Janata Party seal the fate of Aam Aadmi Party A simple look at the CAG website and the number of reports released in a year shows a drop by almost half, relatively during poll years, exception being 2014. This indicates how the ruling parties have done their best to keep the report away from the public glare, while the opposition has ensured it puts a spotlight on it.So, while several reports were used to shape the collective consciousness of the public towards parties like the Congress and the AAP, many other reports were carefully brushed under the carpet.Any discussion on CAG report and politics would perhaps be incomplete without a mention of the 2G scam and the coal block scam that played a key role in the downfall of Manmohan Singh-led UPA government in 2014.The 2G spectrum ""scam"" that led to the loss of Rs 1.76 lakh crores to the exchequer did not turn out to be a scam after the Supreme Court acquitted everyone.The apex court even pulled up the CBI saying that ""the prosecution miserably failed to prove any charge against any of the accused, made in its well choreographed chargesheet.""No matter the verdict, the ""scam"" did what it was supposed to -- put a final lock on the UPA government's fate -- paving way for the ""Modi wave"".The coal scam that led to the downfall of UPA government was much talked about. Referring to this, the NDA government last year dubbed it as the scam that ""shook the conscience of the nation in 2014"", with a loss of Rs 1.86 lakh crore to the exchequer.""These actions were scrutinised by investigation agencies, and in 2014, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India cancelled the allocation of 204 coal mines/blocks allocated since 1993,"" the central government said and rightly so.After BJP came to power in 2014, it had introduced a revamped coal auction and allocation system, facilitating the distribution of those 204 coal blocks. However, in doing so, it ignored warnings from its own leaders who said that it would lead to corruptions and scams.An investigation by The Reporters’ Collective revealed that the Union government had received early warnings in 2015 that its new coal auction system was vulnerable to corruption. However, no action was taken upon those warnings and the government went ahead with the new coal auction regime.And the two MPs were proved right.In 2016, a new CAG report on the e-auctions conducted in 2015 under the NDA government was released. It exposed irregularities in the allocation of coal blocks. The report documented instances of collusion and potential auction rigging by private firms, which secured coal blocks at prices that yielded suboptimal financial returns to the government.It found that the upfront payments made by successful bidders were undervalued by over Rs 382 crore, raising concerns about the fairness and effectiveness of the coal allocation system.Congress was quick to latch on to this and alleged that rules were tweaked to favour one of the leading businessmen from Gujarat, who they claim is close to the government. It also cited instances where it emerged as the sole bidder. However, this never left any impact on the people enough to upend BJP's fate in 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Two years ago, several CAG reports came out but missed the public eye. One of those was that of Dwarka expressway where the cost of construction reached Rs 250 crore per kilometer against the approved cost of Rs 18.2 crore.Further, anomalies were found in the Ayushman Bharat scheme where the payments were being made to the dead. In 7.5 lakh cases, the beneficiaries were found to be linked to the same mobile number which was invalid.Other irregularities included undue benefits in the Ayodhya Development Project, NHAI collecting Rs 132 crore in toll violations, HAL's faulty aircraft engine designs causing Rs 159 crore in losses, and misuse of pension funds by the rural development ministry for promotions, fraud in the Bharat Mala Project with costs doubling, which were used by the Congress, but remained limited to its website and X handles.Even though the timing was apt and the nature of scams were people-centric, an opportunity to create a '2G' was missed by the grand old party as it refused to leave its grand old ways of connecting with the masses.

Poll What is most important in the justice system? Proper Investigation Fair Trial

KANPUR: The phone rang in a small home in Goyera Mughli village of Banda in UP's Bundelkhand. It was February 15. A voice - familiar yet carrying the weight of impending finality - broke the silence. ""This is my last call,"" said Shahzadi Khan , 33.A hush fell over her family. Her brother Shamsher gripped the phone tighter. ""They asked me about my final wish,"" she said, further adding, ""I asked to speak to ammi and abbu.""Her mother gasped in the background, reaching for a daughter who was facing execution after being convicted of murdering a four-month-old child thousands of miles away in Abu Dhabi - too far to hold, too close to lose. And then, silence. Shahzadi was gone.""We did not hear from her afterward,"" Shamsher said Monday. They searched. They begged for news, combing through bureaucratic barriers, unanswered pleas. ""We filed a writ petition in Delhi high court, where we were informed Monday about her execution,"" the brother said.Executed on February 15 - the same day she made her last call. No one knew how. No one knew where her remains lay. Only that it was over. ""Her last rites will be held on March 5,"" additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma said in court.She had left India in search of healing. ""Shahzadi had childhood burn scars on her face,"" said her brother. The scars had always made her self-conscious. ""She wanted to have them removed,"" Shamsher said. When a man named Uzair from Agra reached out on social media, promising help - a chance for plastic surgery in UAE - she dared to dream.She reached Abu Dhabi in Dec 2021 on a legal visa. Upon arrival, Uzair sent her to the home of his relative Faiz, where she was kept as a domestic worker. No surgery, no transformation - only labour and confinement in an unfamiliar world.In Aug 2022, Faiz's wife gave birth to a son and Shahzadi was assigned as the baby's caregiver. Four months later, on Dec 7, the child received routine vaccinations. By nightfall, he was gone.Fazi's grief turned to fury. Shahzadi was accused of killing the infant. She was handed over to Abu Dhabi police on Feb 10, 2023, and was sentenced to death on July 31. She remained in Al Wathba prison until her execution.Her father Shabbir Khan fought relentlessly, sending pleas to anyone who would listen - letters to the President, appeals to the PM. But the clock ran faster than justice. Shamsher demanded his sister's body for a dignified burial at their ancestral home and called for an independent probe, considering their FIR against Uzair for human trafficking ""Uzair deceived my sister with false promises, taking Rs 3 lakh in cash and jewellery from her while also collecting the same amount from his UAE relative to provide them with a maid,"" he said. ""She was a victim, not a criminal. She was innocent,"" Shamsher said. ""She only wanted to fix her scars."" But what of the deeper scars - the ones left behind?",Shahzadi khan was convicted of murdering a four-month-old child in abu dhabi. The 33-year-old was sentenced to death and executed on february 15.

Government defends probe, DRI arrests hotelier’s son

NEW DELHI: Kannada actress Harshavardhini Ranya, popularly known as Ranya Rao , has been sent to judicial custody till March 24 in connection with an alleged Rs 12 crore gold smuggling case .The development comes amid fierce political battle in Karnataka, with the ruling Congress and the opposition BJP exchanging accusations over alleged favoritism and cover-ups.The BJP has alleged that a prominent minister in chief minister Siddaramaiah’s government is shielding Ranya Rao, suggesting a deep-rooted nexus in the smuggling operation. Karnataka BJP president B Y Vijayendra , in a post on 'X', called it “one of the biggest gold heists in recent times,” blaming the Congress government for “churning out scandals in increasingly innovative ways.”Vijayendra further claimed that such large-scale smuggling could not have occurred without the involvement of influential figures within the government. He warned that any attempts to suppress the investigation would backfire, especially with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) stepping in.Meanwhile, the Congress has turned the tables on the BJP, revealing that the previous BJP government had allotted 12 acres of land in Sira, Tumakuru, to Ranya Rao’s company, Ksiroda India, for a steel plant in February 2023. Minister M B Patil shared official documents to back the claim, suggesting that the BJP, now raising questions, had granted land to the same individual they were accusing of a crime.State home minister G Parameshwara urged patience, stating that with both state and central agencies involved, the truth would emerge. ""Neither I nor the government can comment until the investigation is complete,"" he said.Meanwhile, in a fresh twist, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) sleuths arrested a man linked to the case.

Nadda flags oppn bid to raise matters via Rule 267

NEW DELHI: Led by Congress and Trinamool Congress, opposition parties Monday demanded a discussion in Parliament on alleged discrepancies in voter lists, with Rahul Gandhi raising the issue in Lok Sabha.Bringing up the matter during zero hour, Rahul said several states had found discrepancies in voter lists. “Voter lists are being questioned across country and the entire opposition has been demanding a discussion on the matter. Questions have been raised by opposition in one voice in every state, including Maharashtra,” he said. Congress, however, failed to bring it up in Rajya Sabha when party president Mallikarjun Kharge was not allowed to raise the matter.Later, Kharge posted on X, “The abrupt and unwarranted deletion of voters, presence of duplicate EPIC numbers, and other such crucial issues affecting integrity of our electoral process require urgent attention and discussion in Parliament.” SP, AAP and RJD too said it was an extremely serious matter and Parliament needed to take it up.TMC’s Saugata Roy demanded a thorough revision of voter lists, particularly ahead of assembly elections in Bengal and Assam next year. “There are some serious flaws. This has been pointed out with respect to Maharashtra, which had inflated voter lists. This was pointed out in Haryana. They are now trying to jump into Bengal and Assam where elections are due next year,” Roy claimed.Party MP Kalyan Banerjee sought action against EC and said the poll body had “failed” to conduct fair and transparent elections over the past few years.He said the West Bengal CM had already drawn the EC’s attention to numerous instances of “duplicate” voter cards.Leader of the House in RS J P Nadda Monday said govt is ready for discussion on any issue and questioned opposition’s intent over trying to raise matters through Rule 267 which calls for suspension of scheduled business to discuss urgent matters.He termed practice of opposition MPs giving notices under Rule 267 despite elaborate rulings by the chairman on the issue a “vicious design to demean Parliament”. Harivansh did not allow leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge to make his submission. Opposition MPs then protested for a while before walking out.Condemning the walkout, Nadda said opposition was not interested in debate and when their notices were rejected by the chair based on previous rulings, they wanted to give an impression that govt did not want to answer queries.“Govt under PM Modi is ready to discuss anything under this roof. But there are rules & regulations for debates in the House,” Nadda said, further adding that MPs will get an opportunity to raise their issues during the debate on Union Budget over the next 10 days.",Opposition parties led by congress and trinamool congress demand a discussion in parliament on alleged discrepancies in voter lists.

Pradhan doubles down on NEP stand

Sanskrit

merits higher place in both society & academia: BJP

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin came down hard on Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday for calling DMK MPs “uncivilised”.Taking to X, Stalin said, “Dharmendra Pradhan, who thinks he is a king and speaks with arrogance, should mind his words. How can you call Tamil Nadu MPs uncivilised when you are the one who cheated Tamil Nadu by not releasing the funds?”DMK MP Kanimozhi Karunanidhi, too, expressed strong objection to Pradhan’s comments in LS, following which the Union minister said he would retract his words.During a heated Lok Sabha debate on three-language policy on Monday, Pradhan said DMK MPs were “undemocratic and uncivilised”. Condemning Pradhan’s remark, DMK cadres across Tamil Nadu set fire to Pradhan’s effigies. They raised slogans against the Union minister while beating his effigies with slippers.Referring to Pradhan’s remark, Stalin said Pradhan had insulted people of Tamil Nadu and demanded to know from PM Narendra Modi whether he approved of his minister’s speech.Recalling Pradhan’s letter dated Aug 30, 2024, Stalin said it was the minister who said TN entirely rejected the MoU sent by Union govt on NEP. “DMK functions on people’s wishes and not on directions from Nagpur (RSS headquarters),” said Stalin.Kanimozhi criticised Pradhan for his remarks. Taking to X, she said, “I strongly condemn Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan for his disgraceful remarks calling Tamil Nadu and its people uncivilised. On behalf of DMK and eight crore Tamilians, I demand an immediate apology!” The DMK MP further said, “His words deeply hurt and pained the people of Tamil Nadu. What right does he have to insult TN while happily taking its tax revenue, workforce, & contributions to the nation? BJP govt has no problem reaping benefits from Tamil Nadu, yet it repeatedly disrespects its people. We will not tolerate this!”Dharmendra Pradhan intensified his criticism of TN govt on dispute over implementation of NEP and said “those lacking concrete facts resorted to creating an uproar to mislead others”. He urged TN govt to prioritise students’ interests over political considerations. “Just a few days are left before completion of this financial year; govt doesn’t have any issue in providing TN their allocation of PM SHRI but they are not interested in it,” he said, adding, “Those who don’t want to join PM SHRI programme, I appeal to them, it is a scheme for benefit of students, and in TN, the medium of instruction will remain Tamil only. What is their opposition, I do not understand?”Amid protests by DMK members in Lok Sabha over language provisions in National Education Policy , senior BJP MPs Monday staunchly defended promotion of Sanskrit in both academia and society, arguing that its status as one of the oldest languages merits greater recognition.BJP MP Dilip Saikia called for Sanskrit to be made compulsory in universities nationwide, while Nishikant Dubey dismissed DMK’s protests as “politically motivated and attempt to divide the country by inciting passions by opposing NEP and delimitation of parliamentary constituencies”.DMK is opposing NEP and delimitation out of fear of losing the Tamil Nadu assembly polls due next year, he said.“DMK is only inciting passions. Tamil is an ancient language but Sanskrit pre-dates Tamil. Go to any temple across country be it in Tamil-speaking, Telugu-speaking or Kannada-speaking regions — everywhere puja is performed in Sanskrit,” Dubey said.He said in 1973, Congress-led govt increased seats in MP and Bengal in delimitation of parliamentary seats but did not do so in Tamil Nadu. “Despite that, DMK is running govt in partnership with Congress. DMK wants to divide the country by inciting emotions,” Dubey said.",Dmk cadres across tamil nadu set fire to dharmendra pradhan’s effigies.
