Assam CM Calls Zubeen Garg’s Death ‘Plain Murder’, Drops Explosive Revelation

Four of the seven arrested suspects linked to cultural icon Zubeen Garg 's death, including the lone woman in the group, have been charged with murder and another with culpable homicide not amounting to murder in a 12,000-page chargesheet filed Friday by the special investigation team (SIT) probing what happened off Singapore's St John's Island on Sept 19.North East India Festival organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta, at whose invitation Zubeen travelled to Singapore, the singer-composer-actor's manager Siddharth Sharma, band member Shekhar Jyoti Goswami and female singer Amritprava Mahanta will face trial for murder (BNS Sec 103), common intention (Sec 3), and criminal conspiracy (Sec 61).Zubeen's cousin and suspended Assam Police Service officer Sandipan Garg has been charged with culpable homcide not amounting to murder (Sec 105), while PSOs Nandeswar Bora and Paresh Baishya will be tried for criminal breach of trust (Sec 316) and criminal conspiracy.While other details of the chargesheet received by the Kamrup district CJM's court weren't immediately available, CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said its submission within the stipulated timeframe of three months reflected the state govt's commitment to ensuring justice for Zubeen.""We gave the people of Assam our word. As promised, we have filed a chargesheet under Section 103 (murder) and 11 other sections of BNS,"" he said. ""Motive and criminal conspiracy have been established and examined by the advocate general and our director of prosecution.Everyone is convinced the prosecution will be able to get a conviction.""The BJP-led govt plans to petition the chief justice of Gauhati high court to set up a fast-track court for the trial. Sarma said a special public prosecutor would be appointed once the case moves from the CJM's court to a sessions judge. ""These are legal steps that we have to meticulously follow,"" he told reporters.The chargesheet includes the SIT's reconstruction of events leading to Zubeen's death, available evidence, statements of the suspects and the testimonies of 300-odd witnesses.Sarma said the SIT, led by special DGP MP Gupta, had put in ""hard labour"" to build what he said was a watertight case against the suspects. ""Although we have received documents from Singapore, we have built the case with independent findings. Even if court says that no Singapore document is admissible, we have filed a chargesheet with sufficient documentation to prove the charges. Now, it is over to the court. It will definitely give justice. ""Shekhar Jyoti and Amritprava are in a sub-jail in Dima Hasao district's Haflong while the rest are in Baksa district jail.Barring Shyamkanu and the two PSOs, the suspects were on the yacht that took Zubeen to the island for sightseeing and swimming.

NEW DELHI: After ascertaining repatriation of a pregnant Sunali Khatun along with her eight-year-old son to India, Supreme Court on Friday asked the Union govt to consider on humanitarian grounds the pleas for bringing back four others, including her husband, who were deported to Bangladesh in June this year.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi was informed by West Bengal's counsel Kapil Sibal and counsel Sanjay Hegde, who appeared for Sunali's father Bhodu Sekh, that she is back in India and residing with her father. When the bench asked whether adequate healthcare facilities are being extended to her, the state govt said it is providing her with required medical facilities given her advanced stage of pregnancy.Both Sibal & Hegde requested the court & solicitor general Tushar Mehta to consider bringing back the four others, who were deported along with Sunali to Bangladesh, and claimed that they have every document to prove that they were Indian citizens.Mehta said govt will need time to verify documents. The bench said, ""If govt thinks on humanitarian grounds they can be brought back, it can do so. That will be without prejudice to govt's legal arguments in the case.""The SG drew attention to a report on Friday on Sunali and said publication of such reports was meant to create a narrative, which amounts to influencing public opinion. The CJI-led bench said criticising orders of the court & publishing court proceedings in a case is perfectly fine, but attempting to peddle a narrative through a newspaper publication timed to the date of hearing is avoidable.""There should be no running commentary when a matter is sub-judice. Healthy criticism of a judgment is welcome. But publishing opinions on a sub-judice matter... the author and publisher need to be responsible. We judges are totally immune to what is published in newspapers which we go through only in the evening,"" the CJI said.Sibal said, ""Globally, comments are made on sub-judice matters in newspapers. It is not a sacrilege if motive is not attributed to the judge."" The CJI said, ""Problem arises when distorted and half-baked truth is published. It creates a misapprehension in the minds of people."" Hegde said, ""We need to develop thick skin for all these things."" The bench posted the matter for further hearing on Jan 6, when it would consider the plea for repatriation of the other four.","'examine on humanitarian grounds' the pleas for bringing back four others, including her husband, who were deported to bangladesh in june this year.

Around 100 pilots have written to management, questioning external hiring when internal utilization is low. They worry this will further impact their ability to meet contracted flying hours and affect their overall compensation.

Amid Flight Meltdown, IndiGo Chairman Denies Claims of Rule Manipulation and Crisis Engineering

NEW DELHI: IndiGo troubles are having a ripple effect on India's big airlines. Air India group's attempt to fish in the budget carrier's troubled waters by coming out with an ad for experienced Airbus A320 captains has created anxiety within the former's ranks, especially of Air India Express. The reason: AI Express' under-utilised A320 pilots fear a swelling of their ranks will lead to further decline in their flying hours and adversely affect pay. Close to 100 pilots have so far written to the management of Tata Group's low-cost carrier (LCC) so far to oppose the proposed induction. IndiGo is the world's largest operator of the A320 family of planes.Air India Express currently has a fleet of 110 aircraft, of which 76 are Boeing 737s and the remaining 34 are A320 family planes of Air India and AirAsia India. At least 10 of these A320s will be returned to lessors early next year. While the airline will induct more A320s, the time lag in doing so will mean fewer flying hours - or getting the bare minimum 40 hours' flying allowance.During Covid, erstwhile AirAsia India had reduced fixed hour payment contract of pilots from 70 to 40 hours. Subsequently, Air India also reduced the fixed hours. Only erstwhile Vistara did not do that while going in for a pay cut.IndiGo recently shifted to 50-hour fixed contracts for new junior first officers (JFOs), a reduction from the previous 70-hour standard. Fixed-hour contracts ensure pilots will get paid for a minimum of certain hours in case actual flying is less.AI Express, which has about 1,600 pilots, has its A320 aviators up in arms. ""We've consistently been informed over the past year that the group is surplus on A320 captains, which has also been the basis for maintaining the 40-hour contract and declining the requested 70-hour contract... please clarify the reason for initiating recruitment now,"" the letters say.""Why proceed with external recruitment when internal utilisation remains low?... With multiple recent resignations across the A320 fleet... is there a plan to prioritise retention or re-engagement before hiring externally? Won't any additional recruitment at this stage further impact existing captains' ability to achieve the contractually assumed cost to company based on 70 hours of flying?"" they said.","Air india express pilots are protesting the recruitment of new a320 captains.

GOA: Authorities in Goa are revisiting safety concerns at Romeo Lane, a Vagator nightclub linked to the Luthra brothers, after a tourist’s months-old account of the venue’s unsafe layout resurfaced.Vaibhavi, who visited the club in November, described the nightclub as “suffocating” due to its single elevated entry and exit.She said that staff behaved rudely and that security personnel had physically assaulted her group during the visit.""I visited Romeo Lane in Vagator on 1st November with my cousins. We were 13 people in total. The club is built in such a way that it is very suffocating. It has only one entry and one exit and that too at a height. So it is tough to enter and exit from that club. The staff spoke to us rudely and behaved inappropriately. When we were leaving the club around 3 am, a heavy chair was in our way,"" she said.""My cousin shifted it aside with his foot. The manager came to us and said, 'You are damaging the furniture; we should have thrown you out earlier. You don't have the status to be here.' He grabbed my cousin's collar and started speaking to us rudely.When we tried to apologise and leave, he called all the security personnel, the bouncers. They started chasing us and raised their hands at us. Since it was tough to leave that club, they chased us down and hit people in groups. They hit my sister on the chest, pushed her so badly that she fell down the stairs,"" she added further.""They put up a barricade at the entry gate so we couldn't leave... When my brother removed it, a bouncer ran towards him with a rod and started hitting him badly. When I pushed the bouncer to stop him, he hit me too. They were using such bad language towards us that I had never heard before. Since everyone was badly hurt, we decided to go to the Police station in the morning and not right away. I informed the Police, and they told us to come to the Anjuna Police Station the next day,"" Vaibhavi told news agency ANI.Somehow, an FIR was filed after a lot of effort. I had included the names of both owners in my complaint, but the Police later removed them, saying they were not physically present when this incident occurred, so they are not at fault. f you don't take women's safety and tourist safety seriously, such incidents will keep happening in Goa,"" she added further.Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of the fire-ravaged Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, were recently picked up by Thai police from Hotel Indigo in Patong, Phuket, days after fleeing India on an IndiGo flight as 25 people died in a blaze at their club.The brothers became 'persona non grata' in Thailand after their passports were suspended by the regional passport office in Delhi. Their travel documents were declared invalid after they failed to respond to a notice seeking reasons why action should not be taken against them, easing the execution of India’s request for their detention, officials said.","Authorities in goa are revisiting safety concerns at romeo lane, a vagator nightclub linked to the luthra brothers.

Karur Stampede Tragedy: TVK blames DMK For Conspiracy As 40 Die, Nearly 100 Left Injured

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday observed, ""there is something wrong going on in the high court,"" as it rejected the Tamil Nadu government’s plea to modify its earlier order suspending a one-man inquiry commission and the SIT probe into the Karur stampede, which claimed 41 lives. The bench of Justices JK Maheswari and Vijay Bishnoi emphasised, ""We want everything to be fair and impartial.""During the hearing, senior advocate P Wilson, representing the government, said that the state commission would not interfere with the CBI investigation and would only make recommendations to prevent such incidents. The bench then asked Wilson to read the notification appointing the commission and reiterated, ""We want everything to be fair and impartial.""The court reviewed a report filed by the registrar general of the Madras High Court , which highlighted how a writ petition seeking SOPs for rallies was registered as a criminal writ petition. ""There is something wrong going on in the high court. This is not a right thing that is happening in the high court,"" said the bench.Wilson and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra requested a copy of the report, stating they wished to file a reply.The Karur stampede occurred on September 27 during a rally of actor-politician Vijay’s Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK).Police had earlier stated that the rally saw a turnout of 27,000 people, nearly three times the expected 10,000, and attributed the tragedy to a seven-hour delay by Vijay in reaching the venue.On October 13, the Supreme Court had ordered a CBI investigation into the incident, noting that the tragedy ""has shaken the national conscience and deserves a fair and impartial investigation."" In the same order, the court had suspended the state’s directions for appointing a SIT and a one-man inquiry commission and set up a three-member supervisory committee, headed by former apex court judge Ajay Rastogi, to monitor the CBI probe.The top court had also criticised Justice N Senthilkumar of the Madras High Court for entertaining petitions related to the incident, ordering an SIT probe, and making observations against TVK and its members without making them parties to the case.Earlier, on October 30, the court had advised a victim’s family to approach the CBI with allegations that they had been threatened by officials, stating, ""Except to say the same, at present, no further orders are required to be passed on the interlocutory applications.""Noting the political undertone of the case, the court said that comments made to the media by top police officers, ""without having regard to the gravity of the incident,"" could create doubts about impartiality and the fairness of the investigation.","Justices jk maheswari and vijay bishnoi emphasised, ""we want everything to be fair and impartial"" the karur stampede occurred on september 27 during a rally of actor-politician vijay’s tamilaga vettri kazhagam.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125932868,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-921122,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Karnataka Congress MLA Iqbal Hussain on Friday claimed that deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar will become chief minister after the ongoing winter session of the state legislature, adding fuel to speculation over a possible leadership change within the ruling party.Speaking to reporters, the Ramanagara MLA confirmed that he attended a late-night dinner with Shivakumar and several ministers and legislators. He dismissed suggestions that the meeting was a show of strength. ""MLAs from various constituencies have come for the session; it is a rare opportunity for all of us to meet. During the session, we meet each other. We had dinner together. What's there in that? Can having food together be called a show of strength?"" he said.Asked whether Shivakumar shared any political developments during the gathering, Hussain responded, ""I'm giving the good news. He will become (CM) after the session, he will become. What's wrong with it?"" He added, ""....Shivakumar will get a chance, he will become the chief minister now.""Hussain said 50 to 55 Congress legislators attended the dinner. While party leaders described it as a casual meeting, it took place amid heightened speculation over a power tussle between Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar, particularly after the government crossed the halfway mark of its five-year term on November 20.Reacting to remarks that Shivakumar's elevation would depend on destiny, Hussain said, ""Everything will happen if the god has written in one's fate.... We are all confident that Shivakumar has a chance for his efforts, struggle, and organising the party. We have told the same to the high command, the high command will decide.""The MLA reiterated that the Congress remains disciplined and that the final decision on the chief ministership rests with the central leadership. ""Numbers are not important here. We should be committed to the decision they make. They have said that everyone should abide by the party discipline and abide by their decision. This is the party culture, too. We will abide by their decision,"" he said.The Congress high command has recently attempted to contain the leadership friction, with both Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar holding breakfast meetings at each other's residences. The gesture was seen as a signal that Siddaramaiah would continue as chief minister for now, particularly with the Belagavi legislature session underway. The session, which began on December 8, will continue until December 19.Deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar and over 30 Congress legislators, including some ministers, met for a dinner late on Thursday night, party sources told PTI.Ministers K H Muniyappa, Mankal Vaidya, Dr M C Sudhakar, MLAs N A Haris, Ramesh Bandisiddegowda, H C Balakrishna, Ganesh Hukkeri, Darshan Dhruvanarayana, Ashok Kumar Rai, K Y Nanjegowda were among those present in the meeting, the sources added.Expelled BJP MLAs ST Somashekhar and Shivaram Hebbar also attended the dinner, they said.The dinner meeting came a day after CM Siddaramaiah, along with ministers and a few legislators considered close to him, met for a dinner hosted by former Belagavi North MLA Feroz Sait.Though leaders term it a casual dinner meeting, speculation is rife as it had taken place amid a power tussle in the ruling party, over the CM post.There were speculations about a change in chief minister when the Congress government reached the halfway mark of its five-year term on November 20, as it was believed that there was a powersharing agreement between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar after the grand old party won the Assembly election in 2023.As the government crossed this crucial date, activities intensified in Congress, and both the CM and the Deputy CM met over breakfast at each other's residences, on the instructions of the high command. This was seen as a move to pause the leadership tussle between the two and to signal Siddaramaiah's continuation as the CM for the time being, especially ahead of the Belagavi legislature session.","Karnataka deputy cm, ministers, cong mlas meet over dinner: pti sources.

Duo purchased flight tickets on Dec 7, lookout circular issued within 24 hrs

Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of 'Birch by Romeo Lane' nightclub in Goa, were detained by Thai police early on Thursday on the request of Indian law enforcement agencies. As their passports were suspended, they became persona non grata in Thailand, prompting the local police to take them into custody, sources said.Sources said that a team of Thai police located them at Hotel Indigo in Patong, Phuket, based on their travel and passport details and seized their belongings and luggage. Their pictures in Phuket police's custody were released on Thursday and showed the duo handcuffed. They were subsequently shifted to the immigration detention centre where they are likely to be lodged till their deportation. The cops are hopeful of the brothers' return to India by the end of this week with formal channels in communication with each other. India and Thailand had signed a formal extradition treaty in 2013, which came into force in 2015.A team has been sent to Phuket to coordinate the deportation, sources said.

A preliminary investigation by Goa police and Directorate of Fire Services found it was triggered when electric firecrackers struck the wooden ceiling. As flames coursed through the roof, guests and performers bolted. While most of them were able to step out of the club, many were trapped in the basement after the exit caught fire.Besides a partner named Ajay Gupta, five staff members of Birch, chief general manager Rajiv Modak, gate manager Priyanshu Thakur, bar manager Rajveer Singhania, general manager Vivek Singh, and operations manager Bharat Kohli have been arrested till now.","Goa club owners saurabh & gaurav luthra arrested in phuket after deadly fire.duo purchased flight tickets on dec 7, lookout circular issued within 24 hrs.

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Friday claimed that tensions between ‘Team Rahul’ and ‘Team Priyanka’ within the Congress are now “out in the open” after a former party MLA from Odisha wrote to Congress Parliamentary Party chief Sonia Gandhi, urging the removal of party president Mallikarjun Kharge on the grounds that “age is not on his side. ”Ex-MLA Mohammed Moquim suggested that younger leaders, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, should be given greater prominence.""Team Priyanka vs team Rahul out in the open now Internal rift in Congress out! Senior Congress leader from Odisha writes to Sonia Gandhi: Says 'Kharge Hatao ,Priyanka Lao; Hits out at state and central leadership.' He notes a 'deep and growing disconnect' between the Congress leadership and Indian youth, saying that under the current leadership of Mallikarjun Kharge, who is 83, the party has been unable to resonate with the youth,"" BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla wrote on X.Earlier, Moquim, the former legislator from Odisha's Cuttack whose daughter is the sitting Congress legislator from the seat, told news agency ANI, ""The party is going through a difficult phase and needs her advice and new leadership... Age is not on AICC (All India Congress Committe) president Mallikarjun Kharge's side... We should bring forward young leaders.

One of the party’s senior-most leaders, he succeeded Sonia Gandhi, who had been serving in an interim capacity since 2019 after Rahul Gandhi stepped down following the party’s rout in the Lok Sabha elections. She is the longest-serving Congress chief, leading the party from 1998 to 2017, before making way for her son.On the other hand, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra formally entered politics only in January 2019 and currently serves as a general secretary.Her recent Lok Sabha speech on the national song Vande Mataram drew wide appreciation, while her brother’s address on electoral reforms—during which he reiterated his allegations of 'vote chori' against the Election Commission and the ruling BJP—was sharply countered by Union home minister Amit Shah.","Mohammed moquim wrote to congress parliamentary party chief sonia gandhi, urging the removal of party president mallikarjun kharge.

'PM Modi Hacks Hearts, Not EVM': Kangana Ranaut Lambasts Rahul Gandhi During SIR Debate In Lok Sabha

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday said SIR of electoral rolls, being carried out after more than two decades, cannot be a copy-paste of earlier voter lists and, logically, the voter enumeration by the Election Commission would include an inquisitorial process to ascertain, not determine, citizenship.Senior advocate Raju Ramachandran, appearing for a petitioner challenging the validity of SIR process, said voter enumeration exercise cannot begin with distrust on part of EC to test citizenship of every voter, especially when the statutory task to determine citizenship, upon receipt of a complaint about a foreigner, is vested with other authorities.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said, ""EC is constitutionally vested with the power of superintendence of elections, which would include ensuring that only Indian citizens are registered as voters. Would it mean that EC must await a complaint, or undertake an inquisitorial exercise to determine who are doubtful voters? It is better to conduct a summary inquiry rather than await a complaint.""Ramachandran said the SIR for Bihar, according to EC, was necessitated for two reasons - mass migration and rapid urbanisation. ""Reason for Bihar SIR cannot be reason for conducting pan-India SIR as different states have different demography and ground situation relating to electoral rolls,"" he said, adding EC failed to provide detailed reasons for conducting such an exercise.This was the second time when SC had justified updation of poll rolls through SIR. The bench said in the June 24 notification, giving the two reasons for conducting SIR, gives out an intention to carry out pan-India SIR with Bihar as the starting point. ""Migration encompasses both inter-state and cross-border movement of population mainly for economic reasons. For some people across the border, Indian cities are economically more viable. While from India, talented people are migrating to other countries. For citing migration as a reason for SIR, no statistics or research is required,"" it said.Ramachandran said that states like Chhattisgarh and MP, which are going to polls in 2028, are included in SIR exercise, while other states where elections are due in future have been excluded. ""Whole process is arbitrary,"" he added. The arguments would continue on Tuesday.","Sir of electoral rolls, being carried out after more than two decades, cannot be a copy-paste of earlier voter lists.

‘Anti-Sanatan’: Anurag Thakur attacks Tamil Nadu govt over Karthigai Deepam controversy; asks 'why are Hindus lathi charged'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/anti-sanatan-anurag-thakur-attacks-tamil-nadu-govt-over-karthigai-deepam-controversy-asks-why-are-hindus-lathi-charged/articleshow/125930243.cms,"'Hindus Are Lathi-Charged': Anurag Thakur Attacks Tamil Nadu Govt Over Karthigai Deepam Row

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Anurag Thakur on Friday criticised the Tamil Nadu government over the Karthigai Deepam dispute, alleging that it has adopted what he called an ""anti Sanatan"" stance.Raising the issue in the Lok Sabha, the BJP MP said, ""I want to raise a very important issue where one state in India has become a symbol of anti-Sanatan Dharma. Their ministers are making statements against Sanatan Dharma. "" He added that devotees had been compelled to seek judicial intervention to access the temple.Thakur referred to the Madurai bench of the Madras high court, which recently pulled up the state government, accusing officials of ignoring its order on lighting the Karthigai Deepam lamp at Madurai's Thiruparankundram temple. He said, ""People were forced to approach the court to reach the temple. The Madurai bench of the Madras High Court came down strongly on the Tamil Nadu government, accusing officials of deliberately ignoring its order on lighting the Karthigai Deepam lamp at Madurai's Thiruparankundram temple. ""The minister further alleged that devotees faced police action during the episode. ""Hindus are lathi-charged... Why are Hindus stopped?..."" he asked, pressing the government over the treatment of worshippers at the temple.The Karthigai Deepam row escalated sharply lastweek as the Tamil Nadu government again declined to comply with a Madras High Court order permitting the lighting of the ceremonial lamp at the Deepathoon stone pillar atop Thiruparankundram hills. This marked the second consecutive day of defiance, even as a division bench rejected the state’s appeal against contempt proceedings initiated for non-compliance.Tensions rose on the ground, with BJP state chief Nainar Nagendran and several party workers detained in Madurai during protests against the state government. Over 1,000 police personnel were deployed as security forces stopped petitioners and supporters from reaching the hilltop despite the court’s direction.Earlier, a bench of Justices G Jayachandran and K K Ramakrishnan dismissed the state government’s appeal, calling it an attempt to pre-empt contempt action. The bench upheld single-judge Justice G R Swaminathan’s order allowing petitioners to light the lamp at Deepathoon under CISF protection. The single bench had initiated contempt proceedings after officials facilitated lighting the lamp at Uchi Pillaiyar Temple instead of at Deepathoon as directed on December 1.Following the dismissal of the appeal, Justice Swaminathan resumed contempt hearings, set aside the prohibitory orders issued by the Madurai district administration, and again permitted the lighting of the lamp at the hilltop, this time under the protection of Madurai city police. The judge warned that if officials continued to ignore the order, “harsh consequences will ensue.” Officials again blocked access, citing public order concerns.Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu government approached the Supreme Court seeking an urgent hearing on its appeal against the High Court’s orders. When mentioned before a bench led by Chief Justice Surya Kant, the court declined to provide an immediate listing, saying it would consider the request as soon as possible. The state argued that it had exclusive authority over temple rituals and customs under the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act of 1959, and said the High Court could not use contempt jurisdiction to intervene in matters of religious practice.Appearing for a caveator, advocate P V Yogeswaran criticised the state’s approach. He said the government was “repeatedly defying the HC’s orders” and “creating a drama” by filing an appeal to stall contempt proceedings. The High Court has maintained that its directions do not affect the rights of the adjacent dargah and has upheld the petitioners’ right to perform the ritual at the designated Deepathoon site.The state’s appeal in the Supreme Court describes the issue as raising broader questions about the limits of contempt jurisdiction, the autonomy of temple management, and the interplay between judicial orders and executive enforcement powers. It pointed to the district administration’s prohibitory orders issued around 6pm on December 3, at the same time Justice Swaminathan had directed that the petitioner be allowed access to the hilltop. The High Court division bench earlier observed that executive orders under Section 162 of the BNSS cannot override judicial directions and described the timing of the prohibitory orders as indicative of a “well-designed act” to avoid compliance.The division bench will hear related appeals from the Madurai district collector and temple authorities on December 5. Justice Swaminathan had earlier permitted petitioners, including Rama Ravikumar, to light the lamp at Deepathoon after dismissing the state government’s objections about the site’s proximity to a dargah and claims that the ritual had long been conducted at Uchi Pillaiyar Temple.","'hindus are lathi-charged': anurag thakur attacks tamil nadu govt over karthigai deepam row.

NEW DELHI: Expressing solidarity with Madras high court judge Justice G R Swaminathan, 56 former judges Friday issued an open letter urging members of Parliament to withdraw the impeachment notice against him. They warned that the move undermines judicial independence and seeks to pressure judges who do not align with certain political or ideological expectations.Signatories include former SC judges Adarsh Goel and Hemant Gupta, Justice Anil Deo Singh (ex-CJ Rajasthan HC), Justice Narsimha Reddy (ex-CJ Patna HC), Justice P B Bajanthri (ex-CJ Patna HC) and Justice Subhro Kamal Mukherjee (ex-CJ Karnataka HC).The notice was filed after Justice Swaminathan, acting on a petition by a right-wing activist, directed state authorities to ensure that a sacred lamp be lit at a hilltop temple. Govt officials said this went against the longstanding practice of lighting the lamp at the nearby Deepa Mandapam, where the ritual had been observed for years.In their letter, the former judges sharply criticised the attempt to remove him. ""We, the former Judges of SC and former CJs and Judges of HCs, take serious exception to the attempt being made by certain MPs and other senior advocates to impeach Justice G R Swaminathan of Madras HC.This is a brazen attempt to browbeat judges who do not fall in line with the ideological and political expectations of a particular section of society. If such an attempt is permitted to proceed, it would cut at the very roots of our democracy and independence of judiciary.""They stressed that the reasons cited by the MPs do not justify such a drastic step. ""Even if the reasons mentioned by the signatory MPs are taken at face value, they are wholly inadequate to justify resorting to such a rare, exceptional & serious constitutional measure as impeachment,"" the statement said.The former judges further warned that using impeachment to challenge judicial decisions poses a grave threat to the rule of law.""The very purpose of the impeachment mechanism is to uphold the integrity of the judiciary, not to convert it into a tool of arm-twisting, signalling and retaliation. To wield the threat of removal as a means of compelling judges to conform to political expectations is to turn a constitutional safeguard into an instrument of intimidation.Such an approach is ""anti-democratic, anti-constitutional, and an anathema"" to the rule of law. The present attempt to impeach a sitting high court judge for discharging his judicial duty is, therefore, not an isolated episode but part of a continuing assault on dignity and independence of the judicial institution itself. Today, the target may be one judge; tomorrow, it will be the institution as a whole,"" they said.They also noted that this reflects a wider pattern of pressure on the judiciary. According to them, recent years have seen similar attempts to attack or discredit former chief justices Dipak Misra, Ranjan Gogoi, S A Bobde and D Y Chandrachud, as well as current CJI Justice Surya Kant, whenever their decisions upset political groups. They said such efforts aim to use impeachment and public criticism as tools to control judges rather than engage in genuine legal critique.",Say impeachment move a brazen attempt to 'browbeat judiciary' 56 former judges friday issued an open letter urging members of parliament to withdraw the impeachment notice against him.

RAIPUR: Miles away from the hostile forests where Maoist commander Madvi Hidma once ruled with a gun before falling to police bullets recently, another Hidma is getting ready to take aim. But, not at security forces.""I am Hidma, but not that Hidma. I am Muchaki Hidma from Sukma district. I surrendered this year... Now I will aim at my target through archery,"" he says. Muchaki Hidma points at a straw target, preparing himself for Saturday, the concluding day of Chhattisgarh's Bastar Olympics in Jagdalpur, where Union home minister Amit Shah will be watching.Practising at Indira Priyadarshini Stadium on Friday, Muchaki Hidma, who is in his early 30s, says he now realises ""how freedom feels"" - not having to camouflage, hide behind trees or chase human targets with guns.Hidma is part of a team called 'Nuvabaat' - ""new path"". The team is made up of former Maoists and victims of insurgency, who have either surrendered or lost limbs and loved ones to violence. ""The moment I say 'Hidma', people look scared. So I have to clarify,"" he says.Over 700 surrendered Maoists and victims of their violence are expected to take the field on Saturday across disciplines - athletics, kabaddi, kho-kho, archery and traditional games.Hidma says he grew up in a large family where farming was never enough to provide for them. ""We could not expand the farming land due to the forest around. Our family was big and we had meagre resources. When the Naxals came and said, 'Come with us', I went. They gave me a gun.

SC rejects TN's plea for state commission to probe stampede

NEW DELHI: Expressing disapproval over the way in which the Karur stampede issue was dealt with by the Madras high court, Supreme Court on Friday observed that ""something is going wrong in the HC"". The apex court said it would examine the report filed by the HC's registrar general.It, however, turned down the Tamil Nadu govt's plea to allow its commission of inquiry into the cause of the incident in which 41 people died.A bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and Vijay Bishnoi directed that the HC report be shared with the counsels for the parties and called for their response.The apex court had earlier also raised the question of how the HC's principal bench in Chennai could have directed the formation of an SIT, when Karur fell within the jurisdiction of the Madurai bench.""Something wrong is going in the HC. This is not a right thing that is happening in the HC,"" the bench said after going through the registrar general's report.In Oct, SC had ordered a CBI probe into the Karur stampede, which occurred during a rally of actor-politician Vijay's Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) on Sept 27, saying that the incident has shaken the national conscience and deserves a fair and impartial investigation.It had set up a three-member supervisory committee headed by former SC judge Ajay Rastogi to monitor the CBI probe and suspended the directions for the appointment of SIT and a one-man enquiry commission.Senior advocates P Wilson and Siddharth Luthra, appearing for the TN govt, submitted that the state's commission should be allowed to function as it was entrusted the task to find out the reason for the stampede and also to suggest preventive measures. They said that the commission would not interfere with the CBI probe and will confine itself to giving recommendations to prevent such incidents.
