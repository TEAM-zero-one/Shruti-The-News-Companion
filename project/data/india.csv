NEW DELHI: The year gone by witnessed the neutralisation of 364 Naxals by the security forces, even as 1,022 Maoists were arrested and 2,337 opted for surrender, the home ministry informed the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.Replying to separate questions on the status of Left-wing extremism (LWE) in the country, junior home minister Nityanand Rai shared that the total districts that reported incidents of Maoist violence fell to 32 in 2025 from 61 in 2019, while the total number of police stations witnessing such incidents declined to 119 from 245 over the same period.He said LWE incidents showed 88% dip from a high of 1,936 in 2010 to 234 in 2025, while civilians and security personnel's deaths in LWE incidents nosedived to 100 in 2025, which is one-tenth of those recorded in 2010.As per records accessed by TOI, the past one year saw the neutralisation of a dozen Maoists, including their No. 1 Nambala Keshava Rao alias Basavaraju. Apart from Basavaraju, who was a politburo (PB) and central committee (CC) member, 11 other CC members were killed in 2025 and early 2026. Another five CC members, including Mallojula Venugopal alias Sonu who was also in PB, surrendered and joined the mainstream last year.As of now, only 1 PB/CC member and three CC members are alive/active -- Thippiri Tirupathi @ Devji, the current No. 1; Muppalla Laxman Rao @ Ganpathi; Misir Besra; and Malla Raji Reddy @ Sangram. Sources told TOI that Ganpathi and Sangram, both in their late Seventies, have not been active in the recent past.Since 2019, thanks to the upgraded incentives for surrenders by Maoists, as many as 5,880 Maoists, of which 40% (2,337) were in 2025 alone, have eschewed the path of violence and laid down arms. Another 7,409 Maoists have been arrested since 2019. In fact, between Jan 1 and 15 this year, 18 Naxals were arrested and 139 had surrendered.Currently, only 8 districts across three states are categorised as LWE-hit, down from 126 in 2018.The Centre, which has declared a March 31, 2026 deadline to uproot Naxalism from the country, informed the LS that it has released Rs 3,682 crore to LWE-hit states for operational expenditure and training needs of counter-Naxal security personnel, rehabilitation of surrendered LWE cadres and ex-gratia to families of forces and civilians killed in LWE violence. Another Rs 1,761 was sanctioned to LWE states for strengthening their special forces, intelligence units and police stations. Central agencies have been provided Rs 1,224 crore since 2014-15 for setting up security camps in Maoist-infested areas and provisioning helicopters for counter-LWE operations, said Rai.","The year gone by witnessed the neutralisation of 364 naxals by the security forces. 1,022 maoists were arrested and 2,337 opted for surrender.

"Rivers, groundwater under threat as STPs in societies fall into disuse in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rivers-groundwater-under-threat-as-stps-in-societies-fall-into-disuse-in-pune-and-pimpri-chinchwad/articleshow/127894001.cms,"1

Pune: The deteriorated health of rivers winding through Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad has time and again come under the scanner in recent years.A major contributor — citizens, activists and experts alike agree — is the lack of efficient sewage treatment plants (STP) to treat the flow going into these waterbodies, both at the civic level and within individual residential complexes.A Bombay high court order on Jan 19 this year, following a public interest litigation (PIL), directed all municipal corporations statewide to ensure that occupancy certificates (OC) are not given for highrises unconnected to the civic body's sewage lines, or without an STP on their premises.The decision carries import in the city as well, where rapid redevelopment is spawning new housing societies every day, and access to vital resources like clean water is emerging as an urgent flashpoint.Incidents like the Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) outbreak in Pune last year — when drinking supply was contaminated by wastewater — amply demonstrate the need to streamline sewage systems to prevent public health emergencies. .Health risk constantly loomingFar back in Feb 2024, residents of Blue Ridge, a township of around 20,000 residents in Hinjewadi, were alarmed to find bloodworms (chironomid larvae) in their drinking water.The society lifts water straight from the Mula river, which is continually polluted by sewage from upstream neighbourhoods.""When we complained to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and Maharashtra Industries Development Corporation (MIDC), it was found that the contamination was due to direct dumping of untreated sewage into the river. Officials moved the pipe from which sewage was entering the river away from our inlet source and the issue was resolved for us then. But that was not the only origin point of direct dumping into the river,"" explained Vijay Patil, a former committee member of the township and part of the team coordinating with officials.He elaborated, ""There are a lot of smaller population settlements upstream from us and since those areas are rapidly developing, there are multiple labour camps there too, which have no other outlet for the sewage generated by occupants. There is also agricultural land on both sides of the river, which gets polluted by constant use of fertilisers. We have long been victims of this pollution and since we use this water for drinking and other utilities, the fear of disease looms large. We are strict with our STP compliances as we know what happens if untreated sewage is released into any waterbody.""The treated water from the Blue Ridge STP that does not get used by residents is used to water the golf course on the premises. The township has also written to the Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA) and MIDC to provide residents with an alternative source of drinking water, keeping in mind the short- and long-term effects of using contaminated water.Natural water sources contaminatedUnfortunately, cases of untreated effluents polluting groundwater or sewage networks unconnected to a main line are still abundant in the city.As the state nodal agency, MPCB has set up 294 Water Quality Monitoring Stations across Maharashtra. According to a 2023-24 report published by the board, the quality of groundwater mapped at six stations in Pune painted a disturbing picture. Of these, only two recorded ‘good water' (non-polluted); one recorded ‘poor water' (polluted); and three were ‘unsuitable for drinking' (heavily polluted).Case in point: At Casa Imperia Phase 1 in Wakad, society chairman Nitin Selute said sewage from nearby areas, especially upstream, has contaminated the only well they have on their premises — which used to be their main source of water.""There is a nullah on the side of our society that was once a stream. The sewage from this nullah started seeping into the well on our premises. We tried treating the water and using it, but it was so dirty that even our STP couldn't handle the load. Eventually, our flush tank also started stinking. For our safety, we stopped using the well and now are entirely reliant on water tankers. We spend Rs24-26 lakh annually on just domestic and drinking water for 160 flats, which is 40-45% of our budget,"" Selute told TOI.""We live in constant fear of getting sick. It is the civic body's responsibility to provide water to all or ensure that there are clean sources for us to lift from. If permission is given for so many buildings to come up, amenities to cater to them must also be available. There is also a lack of awareness about how our actions affect others. Ensuring accountability from societies, builders, citizens and civic body departments must be mandated,"" he added.For now, society members are engaged in raising awareness in internal groups about conserving water. Their situation is less than ideal despite their fully functional 100 kilolitres/day (KLD) STP being utilised to its maximum potential.Treated water is used for flushing, ensuring 100% reuse of wastewater generated on the premises, with no existing outlet for discharging it outside the society. The STP undergoes monthly PCMC inspections, too.Looking ahead, the society is also taking the guidance of Mission Groundwater, a city-based initiative promoting sustainability in groundwater resources.Casa Imperia Phase 1 residents also plan to submit a letter to all authorities concerned to help them revive the stream next door, including MPCB and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC).Mission Groundwater founder Ravindra Sinha told TOI, ""Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad combined have around 1,000 private STPs in residential and commercial buildings. Most of these are functional, which is good. Many societies use treated water for flushing and some for gardening. Despite this, most of it gets discharged either into a sewage line on its way to the municipal STP, or directly into a stream or river.""Sinha highlighted, ""This is because many buildings also have defunct STPs. Since there are no regular inspections or penal action taken by authorities, such societies face no repercussions. Further, the cost of running an STP is high, which is a deterrent for many. However, there is a lower Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) tariff plan that can be availed. It is also applicable for water treatment plants (WTPs). ""Lack of awareness a key factorAccording to Pradeep Pawar, who runs the Shree Water Tech wastewater and sewage treatment company in Wakad, lack of awareness on the importance of having a functional STP in one's society is the biggest issue across areas.""It is imperative that every society's STP is not just functional, but also well-maintained. Some try to circumvent this process because of high running or electricity costs, but that is absolutely wrong. There is also a lot of misinformation. Many opt for maintenance or daily operations to be run by someone local to save money. However, they might not necessarily have the right knowledge, which in turn will cost the society more than needed,"" said Pawar, a chemical engineer.""The size or cost of running an STP depends on the required capacity, which relies on the number of people living in a society. In many cases, the treated water is required to be released back into the drainage lines as the volume of incoming water is always higher than what can be used for flushing or gardening,"" he further said.""Ultimately, govt authorities, municipal corporations and residents all need to work in tandem if the issue of untreated sewage entering rivers is to be truly addressed,"" Pawar added.OFFICIAL SPEAKAccording to UDCPR 2020, all new societies with more than 100 flats are required to reuse grey water after treating it. However, most are unaware of the difference between grey water (showers, laundry, etc.) and black water (toilets, etc.) STPs. Since the latter is a lot more difficult to treat, the costs also run high. At PMC, we have formed a committee chaired by the additional commissioner, of which I am the member-secretary, with other officers and two representatives from two builder associations on board. We have had three or four meetings till date and are taking builder issues and challenges into consideration, too. While almost 80% of societies have functional STPs in PMC limits, they are unfortunately not being used for a number of reasons. We are now exploring a software option for real-time monitoring of STPs. As far as areas on the periphery are concerned, the sewage network itself is missing there and we have a masterplan for the same— Jagdish Khanore | Chief engineer, drainage department, PMCWe have given notices for non-operational STPs to around 84 societies till date. Many don't run STPs due to high cost, smell or simply because they don't want to take responsibility. In some cases, clashes between builders and society residents over handover has also rendered STPs non-functional. There are a few unofficial connections to drainage lines as well, which we are investigating. We already have a 16,000km drainage network and will be extending this by 285km, for which a master plan has been created. It also includes some modification to the old network line. We have a third-party panel consulting with us and have formed a squad of over 300 staff for regular checks in societies. They collect samples and send them for testing to ensure that STPs are functioning correctly. If any lacunae are found, we first send them a notice; if the situation is not remedied, we cut the water connection for infringement of rules— Sanjay Kulkarni | Chief engineer, drainage department, PCMCMATTERS OF THE COURTA petition was filed in the National Green Tribunal (NGT) after the 2025 GBS crisis, when contaminated groundwater led to many citizens falling severely sick and some having permanent health problems. During this time, several water samples tested from RO plants, private vendors and municipal sources in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad areas showed unsafe contamination well above permissible limits, with coliforms and E. coli detected. The petition in NGT highlighted these environmental and public health hazards, urging immediate intervention to ensure clean water supply, periodic quality monitoring, identification and elimination of contamination sources, and accountability of civic authorities and water tanker suppliers under the ‘Polluter Pays' Principle. We desperately need an overhaul of the degraded sewage infrastructure to protect the fundamental right to safe drinking water for every resident of Pune— Pushkar Kulkarni | Petitioner in NGTHousing societies and highrise projects are legally required under MPCB norms and the Unified Development Control and Promotion Regulations (UDCPR) of 2020 to install and operate STPs and reuse treated sewage, failing which MPCB may deny or withdraw consent to operate, issue notices, or even initiate prosecution. Pursuant to the Jan 2026 directions of Bombay HC, no OCs can be granted unless a functional STP is constructed by a new society. In a recent NGT matter concerning a township project in Pune, the MPCB has initiated punitive action against a renowned builder for repeated violations— Maitreya Ghorpade | Environment lawyerRUNNING AN STP DOES NOT NEED TO BE EXPENSIVEWhen our society was handed over to us in Sept 2019, the power tariff we shelled out was high. Upon research, we found out that MSEDCL offers concessional rates for sewage and water treatment plants. The only condition to avail the lower tariff was that the electric mete that measures usage for the WTP and STP should not be connected to any other society utilities. We made an application in Feb 2020; from June that year, our tariff changed. In May 2020, we were charged Rs11.71/unit, but after concession, this fell to Rs5.11/unit the next month. The society's bill was halved; it used to be approximately Rs6.5 lakh per month earlier but came down to Rs3.2 lakh/month later— Narayan Wadekar | Committee member, Hinjewadi Hills Phase 2Application Process1) The water treatment plant (WTP) and sewage treatment plant (STP) should have a dedicated meter2) Each society has to first check which category their WTP and STP meter falls under. It will most likely be LT I A. This should be changed to the LT III category3) Check your WTP, STP total load as there are three categories under LT III, and all have different charges4) Society needs to send an application to the assistant engineer of MSEDCL office for your zone, along with an attachment of the circular copy, meter reading photo and the paid receipt of the last three months5) All bills must be clear before sending an application to MSEDCL6) It is highly recommended to get an energy audit done by a qualified energy auditor for best results","The deteriorated health of rivers winding through pune and pimpri chinchwad has time and again come under the scanner. A major contributor — citizens, activists and experts alike agree — is the lack of efficient sewage treatment plants (stp) to treat the flow going into these waterbodies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127893996,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-82454,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
MHA: Reverse migration seen in Arunachal’s ‘vibrant villages’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mha-reverse-migration-seen-in-arunachals-vibrant-villages/articleshow/127899119.cms,"ANI file photo

NEW DELHI: Indicating a positive outcome of its vibrant villages programme (VVP), which in is first phase unveiled development projects in villages abutting the Indo-China border across five states, the home ministry told the Lok Sabha on Tuesday that at least three villages in Arunachal Pradesh have reported reverse migration by their people.""No impact assessment has been carried out (of VVP). However, the state govt of Arunachal Pradesh has informed of people returning to villages in border districts of Kurung Kumey, Dibang Valley and Shi-Yomi,"" junior home minister Nityanand Rai shared with the House.The objective of VVP is to create better living conditions and adequate livelihood opportunities to ensure prosperous and safe borders, control trans-border crime and assimilate the border population with the nation and inculcate them ‘as eyes and ears of the border guarding forces’, crucial for internal security. The development and connectivity boost is essentially aimed at preventing outmigration by the residents of border villages.Rai said that projects or works with an outlay of Rs 3,431 crore were sanctioned by MHA under VVP-I, of which villages of Arunachal Pradesh received the lion's share of Rs 2750 crore for a total 2,082 projects. More than 8,500 activities like awareness drives, service delivery camps, training and capacity building initiatives, health and veterinary camps, fairs and festivals and tourism promotion activities, etc, were undertaken, of which 2,966 were in Arunachal Pradesh, 2,221 in Ladakh, 1,836 in Uttarakhand, 1,016 in Himachal Pradesh and 530 in Sikkim.NEW DELHIRai further shared that VVP-II too was approved on Apr 2, 2025 for the comprehensive development of 1,954 identified villages abutting international borders of 15 states and 2 Union territories. An outlay of Rs 6,839 crore has been okayed till 2028-29 for VVP-II, covering villages in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, J&K, Ladakh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Punjab, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.",Three villages in arunachal pradesh have reported reverse migration by their people.

Argument For Lightness

So, your doctor is a man?” he asks, eyes on the road.“Yes,” she shrugs, head wrapped in a scarf.“The oncologist is a man. He was referred to me by my gynaecologist.”“Okay. She must be sure of his credentials then.”“He. My gynaecologist is a man.”“What? You mean he touches you?”₹Questionable questions, awkward puns, well-timed expletives and several unreciprocated high-fives animate ‘Breast of Luck’, a play whose protagonists choose to sing, dance and laugh their way through the grimness of cancer.Co-written and staged by Tannishtha Chatterjee — who was diagnosed with stage IV oligometastatic cancer last year — and Sharib Hashmi , whose wife has beaten mouth cancer four times, the musical comedy, directed by Leena Yadav, opened at the G5A in Mumbai recently to a packed house. The room included Naseeruddin Shah, Dia Mirza, Tanvi Azmi and Divya Dutta, apart from Chatterjee’s doctors and cancer survivors. At the end of the first show, Chatterjee turned to the room and said, “Honestly, I don’t know how I am doing except that I have stopped chasing certainty. ” Shah reassured her: “This is the most cathartic and best thing you could have done for yourself.”To be staged at the Kala Ghoda Arts Festival on Feb 4 to mark World Cancer Day, the script sees opposites distract before they attract.Sheila Roy is a cool, composed classical singer, while Arun Mohan is a goofy divorced stockbroker who punctuates dad jokes with high-fives. When she launches into her riyaaz every morning at 5, he winces and rings her up on the intercom, begging her to stop. Their heated exchanges morph into real-world meetings on a dating app. Just as Roy begins to enjoy Mohan’s company, the story swerves: she is diagnosed with stage IV oligometastatic breast cancer.She pushes Mohan away, convinced love will only expose her vulnerability. He refuses to leave, insisting on staying, his caregiving peppered with relentless puns. That refusal to surrender humour, intimacy or companionship to illness anchors the play’s emotional centre. Often reduced to a serious trope in movies, the Big C finds its funny bone in the drama. “Exactly. That is the USP,” Hashmi says. “Otherwise, it could easily have become a sad story. We chose to see it from a lighter side — with songs, jokes, laughter.”The play draws from a deep personal well. Interspersed through the second half are real hospital visuals — insurance IVRs (interactive voice responses), chemotherapy rooms, and injections. At one point, you watch Chatterjee singing through an injection. “The targeted medicine was extremely painful. But when I sing, those 10 minutes used to pass more quickly,” says Chatterjee, who had invited her friend, a documentary cinematographer, to shoot on the last day of her chemo.Music, laughter and community sustained Chatterjee through the medical journey. Incidentally, Chatterjee — best known for her performances in ‘Dekh Indian Circus’ (2011), ‘Gulaab Gang’ (2013), and ‘Angry Indian Goddesses’ (2015) — was supposed to meet Hashmi of ‘Family Man’ and ‘Filmistaan’ fame on the day her biopsy report arrived. Hashmi had been shooting for her film ‘Full Plate’ and had casually discussed a collaboration.“The day I got my report, I was supposed to meet Sharib for coffee. I almost cancelled,” she recalls. “I was devastated. But I thought if I go home, I’ll have to tell my mother and I’ll feel worse. So I went.”A year before Chatterjee was diagnosed, she had lost her father to cancer. “He died in my arms in the hospital ICU. He was so full of life. When I was diagnosed, my main concern was my mom, who’s 70plus. How would I give this news to her? Because it wasn’t stage one, or stage two, or even stage three — it was stage four.”When she confided in Hashmi, he called his wife Nasreen, who has lived with cancer since 2018. “She gave me a lot of strength,” Chatterjee says. “She said, ‘Look at me. I’ve relapsed four times. I’m here. I’m doing everything.’ After that call, I looked at Sharib and said, let’s write a play for her.”The script took shape during chemotherapy. Rehearsals were scheduled between hospital visits. Improvisations were shaped as much by pain as by laughter. “I was writing while going through treatment. I wanted to laugh constantly. I didn’t want to pull myself down,” says Chatterjee, who found humour in the mundane — doctors clinically debating silicone implants, nurses scolding her and her friends for laughing too loudly in hospital rooms.The rehearsals weren’t easy. “I had, and still have, terrible nerve damage in my shoulder and left arm. Everyone had to be careful while hugging me or touching me because it’s excruciating if it goes beyond a certain range of mobility.”Hashmi relates to Arun Mohan not only as a performer but as a caregiver. “After my wife’s diagnosis, our lives changed completely,” he says. “But she treated cancer like a fever — with courage, humour, incredible strength. We tried to bring that spirit into the play.”Medical professionals echo that sentiment carefully. Breast oncoplastic surgeon Dr Vani Parmar notes that a cancer diagnosis often arrives as a shock, particularly for younger women. “The treatments — radical surgeries, long chemotherapy sessions, hair loss, weakness — lead to immense physical, emotional, social and financial strain, along with a constant fear of recurrence and death,” she says. Changes to appearance, she adds, often trigger anxiety and depression. “‘Chemo brain’, or brain fog, is also part of the territory.”Chatterjee recalls days when she told her doctor she couldn’t do another chemo cycle. “He understood. He knew that in three days, I’d feel differently.” That reassurance — from doctors and fellow survivors — mattered enormously.While psychological counselling is not routinely integrated into many hospitals, it is increasingly being recognised as an essential part of cancer care. Priyadarshini Deo, counsellor at the Centre for Cancer and Palliative Care at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, points to studies showing that humour and movement-based activities can significantly enhance emotional health. “Humour and lightness reduce stress, ease anxiety, improve communication and strengthen relationships, especially with caregivers,” she says.A case for lightness arrives in actor Lisa Ray’s memoir Close to the Bone, in which she recalls the day she was diagnosed with cancer by a “jittery, rabbit-faced doctor”. “He spoke very slowly, pausing for a long time between each word, as if to gauge my reaction. You. Have. Multiple. Myeloma.” The doctor, Ray writes, reminded her of the rabbit in ‘Alice in Wonderland’. “As he kicked me down the hole, he never said the word ‘cancer’. ”“Oh,” Ray replied. “Do you want me to get you some water?”Her response, she writes, might seem strange. “But he did look parched. Also, it never occurred to me that I wouldn’t get better… I was framing it as just another adventure.”Apart from music, what sustained Chatterjee after her diagnosis was community. “I cried alone in my car with my reports,” she says. “My sister told me — you can’t save yourself alone.” Friends video-called her and joked about everything from Trump’s antics to local absurdities. “It helped me sleep. It made me feel light.”Why, we ask her, is cancer so often portrayed in popular culture only through despair and solemnity? “Because it usually comes from an external perspective, not lived experience,” Chatterjee says. “I think there’s a fear — how can I be sensitive (towards the topic)? I was fearless because it’s me.”The play does not trivialise her struggles, including her prolonged insurance battles. Her arguments with an automated voice convey her frustration. “The day my insurance refused me, I was at my lowest. The treatment is excruciatingly expensive. I’m not a commercial actor. I’m an alternative, arthouse actor. I’m not rolling in money. And I have a mother and a daughter to take care of,” says Chatterjee. Her daughter lived with the actor’s sister in the US during treatment.Care for the caregiver, too, is crucial, Dr Parmar reminds us. “There is emotional burnout, financial strain and disrupted routines. Clear communication, shared decision-making and emotional support make the biggest difference.” She urges the integration of psychological and financial support into standard cancer care. “Good healthcare at an affordable cost is a right.”“My doctors told me this isn’t just about cancer,” Chatterjee says. “In any illness, people should watch it — to see how art, music, laughter and community are therapeutic.”The audience response suggests the message has landed. Survivors have cried and laughed in equal measure. Caregivers have recognised themselves. Those who have lost loved ones have found something gentler than grief alone. Hashmi’s wife has seen the play three times. “She loved it,” he says.","'breast of luck' is a play whose protagonists choose to sing, dance and laugh their way through the grimness of cancer.

NEW DELHI: A study comparing homeopathic treatment with conventional primary care for infants has been retracted by European Journal of Pediatrics, citing serious flaws in the study design.In a retraction note, the journal’s editor said concerns were raised after publication about the methodology of the randomised controlled trial, particularly the absence of blinding and placebo controls. A post-publication review found that these shortcomings could introduce “significant bias” in the interpretation of the data and conclusions.The editor said the flaws were fundamental and could not be corrected through an erratum, adding that there was no longer confidence in the reliability of the article.The study, published in 2024, examined homeopathic treatment versus standard primary care for kids during the first 24 months of life, a period requiring high ethical and scientific safeguards.According to the journal, the authors have been invited to submit a revised manuscript addressing the concerns. However, the retraction note states that the authors do not agree with the decision, a position conveyed by lead author Menachem Oberbaum.The paper involved authors from multiple institutions, including India, and had drawn attention because it compared an alternative system of medicine with conventional care in a vulnerable age group.Although the article remains available as an open-access publication, it is now clearly labelled as retracted.",Study comparing homeopathic treatment with conventional primary care for infants has been retracted.

HYDERABAD: Telangana police have arrested a man from Maharashtra for murdering one of his three children so that he would be eligible to contest the gram panchayat election. Those with more than two children are barred from contesting local body elections in Maharashtra.Pandurang Kondamangale, a resident of Kerur village in Nanded, who was arrested on Monday, has been accused of drowning his six-year-old daughter, Prachi, in the Nizamsagar canal in Nizamabad on Jan 29. ""Pandurang first had twin daughters, including Prachi,"" a police officer told TOI. ""Later, he had a son too. He decided to kill Prachi to realise his political ambitions.""Officials also arrested the present sarpanch of Kerur, Ganesh Shinde, for allegedly helping Pandurang plan the murder.The killing came to light after police officers from Nizamabad's Bodhan rural police station started investigating the suspicious death of an unknown girl, whose body was found in the Nizamsagar canal. To identify the girl, a constable uploaded a photograph of the body as his status message on WhatsApp and asked people to share leads. The image was also shared with other police stations.Within a few hours police officers from Mukhed taluk in Maharashtra contacted their counterparts in Bodhan and identified the girl as Prachi, barber Pandurang's daughter, who had been missing for a few days.Bodhan police officials then got in touch with Pandurang and found that he was giving inconsistent replies to many of their queries.Suspecting that Pandurang had killed his daughter, police officials tracked his mobile phone's tower locations and found out that he had brought Prachi to Telangana. During interrogation, he allegedly cracked and confessed to killing Prachi.Officials alleged that Ganesh encouraged Pandurang to contest the panchayat elections, due in about six months. However, both realised that Pandurang would be ineligible as a candidate as he had three children.Nizamabad police commissioner P Sai Chaitanya said the duo initially tried to give the girl up for adoption to couples wanting children. ""When the attempt failed, they allegedly conspired to kill Prachi. On Jan 29, Pandurang came to Nizamsagar canal with Prachi and pushed her into the water before returning to his village,"" Sai Chaitanya said.","Pandurang kondamangale, a resident of kerur village in nanded, was arrested on monday.

JAMMU: Peoples Conference MLA Sajad Lone’s amendments for restoration of Article 370 , Article 35-A and J&K’s statehood in lieutenant-governor Manoj Sinha’s address to the assembly’s budget session were rejected on Tuesday amid bedlam over several issues, mainly BJP’s demands for a National Law University (NLU) in Jammu.Sinha’s address at the start of the session on Monday did not mention the two matters. Rejecting the amendments, Speaker Abdul Rahim Rather of the governing National Conference (NC) told Lone the House had already passed a resolution on special status in its first session in Nov 2024 and rules do not permit further discussions on an issue already debated.The Speaker further pointed out that granting statehood falls within the domain of the Centre and advised Lone to raise only those issues on which J&K govt is competent to respond or take a decision.Outside the assembly, Lone said four of his other amendments were, however, accepted, including those concerning daily wagers, NLU and condemnation of attacks on Kashmiris outside J&K.Lone dismissed as “theatrics” protests outside the assembly by NC MLAs for statehood and special status. “History will read what was said and decided inside the House,” Lone said. NCP MLA Mubarak Gul asserted the demands will be raised in the House during this session.The NLU row continued to polarise the House, with Lone citing chief minister Omar Abdullah’s assurance. J&K has no NLU at present but the demand for it to be located in Jammu gained traction after Omar said last year that it would come up in Kashmir’s Budgam. Omar has rejected BJP’s demands on NLU, calling them “politically motivated” and pointing out that there were no protests in the Valley when Jammu was given both an IIT and an IIM.As House proceedings started on Tuesday, BJP MLAs renewed the NLU demand, while NC and PDP legislators took up the issue of alleged harassment of Kashmiri Muslims outside J&K.BJP’s Surjit Singh Slathia pointed out that students are demonstrating on streets for the NLU to be based in Jammu and his party stands with them. Another BJP MLA, Balwant Singh Mankotia, argued that Jammu would be a better location for NLU in terms of security, weather and road connectivity.NC MLAs highlighted the alleged harassment of Kashmiris in various parts of the country and were joined by some lawmakers of opposition PDP. “I support the cause, not NC,” PDP MLA Muntazir Mehdi clarified.PDP’s Waheed-ur-Rehman Para moved an adjournment motion to discuss alleged attacks on Kashmiris, arguing they were “hate crimes”. Speaker Rather rejected the move. He said the Omar-led govt has taken up the issue with various states and is thankful to Pushkar Singh Dhami, CM of BJP-governed Uttrakhand, for taking action recently in one such case.",Sinha’s address at the start of the session on monday did not mention the two matters.

Attempt to prevent me from speaking on issues of national security: Rahul

NEW DELHI: Eight opposition MPs of the Congress and the CPI-M were suspended from the Lok Sabha for the rest of the Budget Session on Tuesday for “unruly behaviour”. MPs mounted the table and hurled papers at the Chair after Rahul Gandhi was disallowed for the second day from speaking on former Army chief General Naravane’s purported revelations on Chinese aggression in his unpublished book.In a protest letter to Speaker Om Birla, Rahul said it was the first time the LOP was not allowed to speak on the President’s joint address, and it is a blot on democracy.The suspensions and bedlam have put a question mark on proceedings for Wednesday, when PM Narendra Modi is scheduled to reply to the motion of thanks on the President’s address. Govt sources said the PM’s reply will go on as planned.The suspended members are Congress’ Manickam Tagore, Gurjeet Aujla, Amarinder Raja Warring, Hibi Eden, Prashant Padole, C Kiran Kumar Reddy, Dean Kuriakose, and CPI-M’s S Venkatesan.After the Tuesday morning session was adjourned owing to the opposition’s demand that the govt discuss the Indo-US trade deal, Rahul Gandhi picked up from Monday when his insistence on speaking on Naravane’s unpublished book elicited a red flag from the govt.Speaker Om Birla ruled that the LOP could not cite the book and should speak on motion of thanks.On Tuesday, Rahul said he was authenticating the press article he was referring to for Naravane’s book, as was asked by the Chair, but parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said the Chair had ruled that he could not speak on the issue.As Rahul again started his speech with the contentious subject, Presiding Officer Krishna Prasad Tenneti overruled him and called the next speaker from SP Uttam Patel to speak, who refused.He moved to Shatabdi Roy of TMC who too did not speak. When BJP ally TDP’s Harish Balayogi started his speech, the angry opposition members trooped into the well. While they raised slogans, Prashant Padole climbed on the secretary general’s table, even as some members threw papers at the Chair, which forced the house to be adjourned. On resumption, Presiding Officer Dilip Saikia suspended the eight MPs. It led to bedlam and the house was adjourned for the day.In a protest letter to the Speaker, Rahul Gandhi said a member can refer to a document in his speech after authenticating it, and the refusal to let him speak suggests “there is a deliberate attempt to prevent me as LOP from speaking on matters of national security”.During the fracas, presiding officer Tenneti objected to Congress MP K C Venugopal’s use of “yaar” (pal) in his angry interventions to back Rahul Gandhi.",Eight opposition mps of the congress and the cpi-m were suspended from the lok sabha for “unruly behaviour” mps mounted the table and hurled papers at the chair after rahul gandhi was disallowed for the second day from speaking on former army chief general naravane’s purported revelations on chinese aggression.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127896613,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

JAMMU: A fierce encounter broke out between a joint team of security forces and a group of terrorists holed up in a remote, forested area in Basantgarh, in J&K’s Udhampur district, on Tuesday. The Army’s White Knight Corps, in a statement on X, said a cordon had been set up and “Operation Kiya” was in progress.Officials said at least two to three Pakistani terrorists were believed to be trapped within the cordon.

Combing was also carried out in the surrounding Marta, Kulthian, Sohan, Kheal, and Chour Mottu areas on Monday. Counter-terrorism actions continued in Ramgarh’s forests and Kalas top in Rajouri district, and the upper reaches of Poonch, Kathua, Doda and Reasi districts to track and kill fleeing terrorists.Meanwhile, Operation Trashi-I — launched in the forested Chatroo belt of Kishtwar district on Jan 18 — entered its 17th day on Tuesday as troops continued trudging through knee-deep snow to trace hiding terrorists.White Knight Corps Commander had visited the district Monday to review the counter-terrorism grid and assess the operational preparedness of units deployed in the region.Under Operation Trashi-I, security forces have engaged in four encounters with terrorists in the past fortnight. Initial contact was established in Sonnar forest near Mandral-Singhpora, Chatroo, on Jan 18, in which eight security personnel were injured, one of whom eventually succumbed. On Jan 22, another gunfight broke out with holed-up ultras in Singhpora. Yet another firefight followed on Jan 24, in which a Pakistani Jaish terrorist was shot dead.

'Arrogant, Liar': Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee Attacks CEC Gyanesh After SIR Meet In Delhi

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Monday rejected West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee ’s allegations against Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar.ECI sources claimed the Trinamool Congress leader “raised false allegations, misbehaved, thumped the table and left” during a meeting on the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls.According to news agency ANI citing sources, CEC Gyanesh Kumar responded to the queries raised by Banerjee, who led a party delegation to the Election Commission and explained that the rule of law would prevail throughout the SIR process.“The CEC responded to her queries and explained that rule of law shall prevail and anybody taking law into their own hands shall be dealt with strictly as per the provisions of law and powers vested in the Commission,” according to sources.The source added that despite “polite posture” of the CEC and the two other Election Commissioners, Banerjee allegedly behaved in an inappropriate manner. “The Trinamool Congress leader raised false allegations, misbehaved, thumped the table and left,” it claimed.ECI sources also alleged that TMC leaders and legislators have been targeting election officials in West Bengal. It alleged that TMC MLAs are openly using abusive and threatening language against the Election Commission and especially against the CEC.“There have been incidents of vandalisation of the ERO (SDO/BDO) offices by TMC workers and MLAs,” the source alleged.The poll body further stressed that officers involved in the SIR process must be allowed to function without pressure. “No pressure, obstruction, or interference of any kind by anyone should be exerted on officers engaged in work concerning the Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls,” the sources said.The Election Commission also raised administrative concerns, stating that honorarium for Booth Level Officers (BLOs) had not been fully paid. “Only Rs 7,000 out of Rs 18,000 per BLO has been paid so far,” a source said, adding that payments should be released without delay.The sources further said that the EROs and AEROs deployed in the state were not of the required rank. They highlighted that the Commission had sought proposals for the appointment of Returning Officers on January 20 as per prescribed criteria, but only 67 Assembly constituencies currently have ROs of the rank of SDO or SDM.The ECI also alleged procedural lapses by the West Bengal government, including the transfer of three Electoral Roll Observers without consulting the Commission. “The ECI requested cancellation of the transfer orders on January 27, but no action has been reported so far,” a source said.Additionally, the poll body claimed that no FIR had been registered against four election officers, two EROs and two AEROs and one Data Entry Operator for their failure to perform their statutory duties and for violating data security policies by sharing log-in credentials with unauthorised persons.Earlier in the day, Banerjee had sharply attacked the CEC while speaking to reporters outside the Election Commission office. “I am very sad. I have been involved in politics in Delhi for a very long time. I was a minister four times and an MP seven times. I have never seen such an Election Commissioner who is so arrogant, who is such a liar,” she alleged.The West Bengal chief minister accused the poll body of selectively targeting her state and questioned the deletion of voters’ names. “Why Bengal is being targeted? Elections are a festival in a democracy, but you deleted the names of 58 lakh people and did not allow them to defend themselves,” she said.The confrontation comes ahead of Assembly elections in West Bengal, scheduled to be held in the first half of this year and amid heightened political tension over the ongoing nationwide SIR exercise, which is currently under way in 12 states and union territories. The final electoral rolls are scheduled to be published on February 7.","The election commission of india (eci) on monday rejected west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee ’s allegations against chief election commissioner gyanesh kumar.

LUCKNOW: Gold buys food. In eastern Uttar Pradesj, food brought gold. For a 12-year-old schoolboy, an offer of unlimited free momos was worth more than the metal locked in a family cupboard. For two roadside vendors, the boy’s craving turned into a gold mine.Police said the class 7 student handed over jewellery worth Rs 85 lakh from his family home to momo sellers near Dumari Chauraha in Deoria — about 350km east of Lucknow — trading ornaments for what he was promised would be a lifetime supply of free dumplings. The trail surfaced when jewellery vanished from the cupboard. The boy’s mother and aunt went looking. The cupboard was empty. Questions followed. The child broke down and told his father he had traded the valuables for “unlimited free food for a lifetime”.According to a complaint filed by the boy’s father, a temple priest, the child had grown fond of momo sold at the roadside stall.The vendors allegedly began feeding him free of cost, winning trust bite by bite. Soon came bigger offers — food, small sums of money, loyalty.Then persuasion. Unaware of the stakes, the boy began removing jewellery from home and handing it over, police said.Gold necklaces. Rings. Bangles. Mangtika. Nose pins. Earrings. Silver toe rings. Family heirlooms, one snack at a time. The vendors vanished soon enough.The priest approached police on Feb 1, alleging the momo sellers threatened the child with dire consequences to keep him silent. Police teams are now searching for the two fugitives and tracing the jewellery trail, SHO Devendra Kumar Singh said, adding legal action will follow. Other suspects are also being questioned.",Police said the class 7 student handed over jewellery worth rs 85 lakh from his family home to momo sellers.

'Called Me Yaar, Threw Papers': TDP MP Tenneti Slams Eight Suspended Lok Sabha MPs

NEW DELHI: TDP MP Krishna Prasad Tenneti, who was presiding over the Lok Sabha proceedings on Tuesday when some opposition MPs threw papers at him, said that someone from the opposition called him “yaar” (friend/buddy) and, when he objected, a few MPs charged at him and began tearing and throwing papers.Later, eight MPs, including seven from the Congress, were suspended from the House for the rest of the Budget session “When I was in the chair, somebody from the opposition was calling the chair as ‘yaar,’ which is objectionable in any House of Representatives. I pointed that out. The response I got was, ‘what is wrong in saying “yaar”’ — which is not correct,” Tenneti, who was filling in for Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, told ANI.""In continuation of that, some of them came to the table and started tearing papers and throwing, which is again objectionable.

BENGALURU: The Karnataka high court has imposed Rs 50,000 in costs on Wipro Enterprises Private Limited, terming its stand in an ex gratia payment dispute an abuse of the process of law. The cost is payable to a former staff who was the plaintiff before the civil court.The dispute concerned the non-payment of an ex gratia amount promised to Ratnesh Pandey, a resident of Haryana, who resigned from the company in Sept 2017 after working for nearly 12 years in various posts. Pandey tendered his resignation on Aug 6, 2017, and it was accepted on Sept 18, 2017.In recognition of his contribution, he was offered an ex gratia lump sum amount of Rs 6,32,000, payable after 18 months from the date of cessation of employment, subject to the condition that from the date of cessation he would not join competing companies, namely Philips India Limited or Bajaj Electricals Ltd. As the ex gratia amount was not paid even after 18 months and repeated correspondence, Pandey approached the civil court seeking payment of the amount along with 18% interest.Wipro disputed the claim, contending that Pandey had not accepted the terms and conditions of the cessation letter and therefore was not entitled to payment of the ex gratia amount. On July 23, 2024, the 20th additional city civil judge, Bengaluru, ruled in favour of Pandey.Wipro appealed, arguing the cessation letter dated Sept 18, 2017, for want of acceptance from Pandey, stood revoked under Section 6(2) of the Indian Contract Act-1872, and that belated acceptance after 18 months was unacceptable. Pandey said Wipro never alleged breach of contract conditions before the civil court.In his ruling, Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum noted that Aug 19, 2017, was Pandey’s last working day and rejected Wipro’s claim that signing and returning the letter was a mandatory condition, holding that the phrase “return to us for records” could not be treated as a condition precedent. HC held Wipro had acted upon the cessation letter and, having failed to prove any breach by Pandey, could not deny payment on hyper-technical grounds.","The karnataka high court has imposed rs 50,000 in costs on wipro enterprises private limited.

BENGALURU: In a cheque bounce case, the Karnataka high court has ruled that trial courts cannot levy fines exceeding twice the dishonoured cheque amount.Justice V Srishananda made the observation while partly allowing an appeal filed by Mahadevi, an agriculturist from Banahatti in Bagalkot district. In Nov 2007, Mahadevi bought two trailers for Rs 3.8 lakh after she was allowed a Rs 5,000 discount.She issued a cheque for the trailers, but the cheque was dishonoured. Following this, the seller registered a cheque bounce case. On May 8, 2017, the magistrate’s court at Banahatti convicted her, directing her to pay Rs 7.6 lakh as compensation to the seller and Rs 5,000 as defraying expenses to state govt.Mahadevi’s appeal against the order was dismissed by the district court, and she moved the HC. She said the trailers had not been delivered to her, but Justice Srishananda noted Mahadevi had failed to establish her claim. The judge directed Mahadevi to pay Rs 7.6 lakh as compensation to the complainant, but set aside the order regarding Rs 5,000 to be paid towards defraying expenses, ruling that no state machinery was involved in the transaction.","In a cheque bounce case, the karnataka high court has ruled that trial courts cannot levy fines exceeding twice the dishonoured cheque amount.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday granted bail to former excise minister and sitting Congress MLA Kawasi Lakhma more than a year after he was arrested by Enforcement Directorate in a Chhattisgarh liquor scam related money laundering case.A bench, headed by CJI Surya Kant, released Lakhma on bail saying given the fact that prosecution has cited many witnesses, there is little chance of early conclusion of the trial and that Lakhma has been incarcerated since Jan last year.However, the bench asked Lakhma to stay outside Chhattisgarh and attend the trial proceedings by reaching the trial court a day prior. When his counsel Sidharth Dave said Lakhma is required to attend assembly, the bench said in that case it can direct his suspension from the House.Earlier when Lakhma’s counsel Mukul Rohatgi said there is no evidence against him, and that he has been roped in due to political vendetta.

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Tuesday summoned Congress’s Jairam Ramesh, Pawan Khera and Ragini Nayak in a criminal defamation case filed by India TV chairman and editor-in-chief Rajat Sharma.Magistrate Devanshi Janmeja of Saket court noted there were “sufficient grounds” to summon the three on July 27. The summons direct the three to respond to charges under IPC sections 465 (forgery), 471 (using forged document or electronic record), and 499 and 500 (criminal defamation).The complaint stems from allegations by Nayak in June 2024 that Sharma used “derogatory language” against her during a live TV debate.

LUCKNOW: The Lucknow bench of Allahabad high court on Tuesday said that under the current law, no person or political party can be completely barred from contesting elections merely on the ground that it is influencing voters on the basis of caste or religion.The court said that it is the subject of the legislature to make laws in this regard, and the Election Commission cannot cancel the registration of any political party on this ground.A division bench of Justice Rajan Roy and Justice AK Chaudhary passed the verdict on a PIL filed by Motilal Yadav in 2013, seeking direction against holding of caste-based rallies by political parties. In an interim order in July 2013 itself, a bench of Justice Uma Nath Singh and Justice Mahendra Dayal had stayed caste-based rallies “with immediate effect” throughout UP.In its final order on Tuesday, the court said that Section 8A of the Representation of the People Act is the only provision under which disqualification is permitted in cases of electoral malpractice. The high court clarified that the power to impose a pre-emptive ban on a political party or individual is not currently available in the law and that this matter falls entirely within the jurisdiction of the legislature.Citing previous Supreme Court decisions, the court stated that even the Election Commission does not have the power to deregister a political party except under limited circumstances prescribed by the apex court.The high court also clarified that the recognition of a recognized political party can be suspended or withdrawn under Paragraph 16A of the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968. However, only the legislature, not the court, has the power to add new or additional provisions in this regard. The court, however, cited an order of the UP govt passed in Sept 2025 which bans caste-based rallies in the state.",Lucknow bench of allahabad high court said no person or political party can be completely barred from contesting elections.
