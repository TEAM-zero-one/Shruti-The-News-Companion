It is a recognition of this fact that a greater representation of women in the judiciary, would greatly improve the overall quality of judicial decision making and this impacts generally and also specifically in cases affecting women.""HC had terminated six women judicial officers. SC took suo motu cognisance and requested HC to reconsider the decision. HC revoked the terminations of Jyoti Varkade, Sonakshi Joshi, Priya Sharma and Rachna Atulkar Joshi. The remaining two terminated officers challenged their termination before SC.Justice Nagarathna said judicial appointment of women at senior levels can shift gender stereotypes.One of the terminated judicial officers had suffered a miscarriage during the period of scrutiny of her judicial work. The bench said such an event results in psychological consequences and observed that the administrative committees of the HCs need to be sensitive towards women judicial officers & their health.While ordering their reinstatement in judicial service within 15 days, the SC said the petitioners would not be entitled to any salary from the date of termination till their reinstatement but the monetary benefits for the said period shall be calculated notionally for the purpose of pensionary benefits. SC added that HC's administrative committee can decide the pending complaints against the judicial officers in accordance with law.","Hc had terminated six women judicial officers.

High courts can stay discharge orders only in rare cases: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/high-courts-can-stay-discharge-orders-only-in-rare-cases-sc/articleshow/118639888.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Observing that staying a trial court's reasoned order to discharge an accused in a criminal case resulted in curtailing the liberty granted to him, Supreme Court on Friday said high courts should stay an order only in rare and exceptional cases when the discharge order prima facie looked ""perverse"".A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said a discharged accused stood on a higher pedestal than an accused who was acquitted after a full trial as discharge order was passed at the threshold when no incriminating material was found against the person. It said staying of discharge order in such cases resulted in the person becoming an accused again.""An order staying the order of discharge is a very drastic order which has the effect of curtailing or taking away the liberty granted to the accused by the discharge order. As a result of the order staying the order of discharge, the order of discharge ceases to operate, and the sessions court can proceed to frame charges against the accused and try him further. Thus, the stay of the discharge order has a grave consequence of depriving an accused of the liberty granted under the discharge order,"" the bench said.The court set aside Delhi high court 's order which had stayed a discharge order without hearing the accused. SC agreed with senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who, appearing for the petitioner, said the consequence of the stay order was that trial would proceed against the petitioner even though he stood discharged.""It is only in rare and exceptional cases, where the order of discharge is ex-facie perverse, that the revisional court can take the extreme step of staying that order. However, such an order should be passed only after giving an opportunity of being heard to the accused. Moreover, while granting the stay, the court must mould the relief so that the trial does not proceed against the discharged accused,"" the bench said.""When a revision application challenging the order of discharge is admitted for hearing, the high court may exercise power under Section 390 by directing the person discharged to appear before the trial court and by directing the trial court to admit him to bail on appropriate terms and conditions. If such an order is passed after the admission of the revision application against the order of discharge, it is a sufficient safeguard for ensuring the presence of the discharged accused at the time of hearing of the revision application and for undergoing trial, if the order of discharge is set aside,"" it added.",Justices abhay s oka and ujjal bhuyan said a discharged accused stood on a higher pedestal than an accused who was acquitted after a full trial.

SEBI appoints Finance Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey as new chairman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/after-private-sector-experiment-finance-secretary-tuhin-kanta-pandey-named-sebi-chief/articleshow/118611693.cms,"Tuhin Kanta Pandey

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: Government on Thursday named finance secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey as the new Sebi chairman , opting for a civil servant to once again lead the market regulator after current chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch , a former ICICI Bank executive, faced controversies, including allegations of conflict of interest. Buch's term ends on Friday.Pandey, who turns 60 in August, has been given a 3-year term at Sebi. This marks another instance of a serving bureaucrat being appointed to a regulatory post before retirement. Barring Puri Buch, the other 10 Sebi chiefs have either been IAS officers or have come from the public sector.Once Pandey takes charge, three of four financial regulators will be led by IAS officers, with pension regulator Dipak Mohanty (an ex-RBI executive director) being sole exception. The 1987-batch IAS officer has had a long stint in the finance ministry, having served as secretary in the department of investment and public asset management (DIPAM) for five years.During that period, he was involved with privatisation of Air India and involved with several public issues by public sector companies, exposing him to stock markets. In Jan, weeks before the Budget, Pandey was moved to the revenue department.The soft-spoken officer, who hails from Punjab, holds a master’s degree in economics and had served as finance secretary in Odisha and was earlier in Planning Commission. He also holds an MBA from the University of Birmingham.Pandey is known to be a stickler for rules and has a very clean image. Not shy to speak his mind, he makes his point, without offending anyone. One of the first tasks before him would be to deal with staff challenges, which came to the fore during Puri Buch’s tenure, when Sebi employees held a demonstration at the agency’s BKS headquarters, in what was seen as a revolt against new HR policies. He has to restore the confidence among stakeholders that the Sebi chief is impartial.",Tuhin kanta pandey has been given a 3-year term at sebi.

Uttarakhand avalanche: Mana villagers saved by ancient wisdom & annual migration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uttarakhand-avalanche-mana-villagers-saved-by-ancient-wisdom-annual-migration/articleshow/118637614.cms,"Each Nov, as doors of Badrinath temple close, residents of Mana move to Gopeshwar, Jyotirmath, and Jhinkwan in Chamoli district, leaving behind their homes and livelihoods to escape harsh winter

DEHRADUN: Mana, a 2,000-strong village in the upper reaches of Garhwal Himalayas , had already emptied out when disaster struck. By the time an avalanche crashed down the Mana-Ghastoli route on Friday morning, smothering everything in its path, the roads were deserted, the homes abandoned. As a result, not many heard the sound of ice fracturing, snow cascading, and the earth shuddering under its weight. They are now counting their blessings.The villagers' migration, a ritual dictated by centuries of wisdom, is more than tradition - it is survival. The Himalayas demand deference, and the people of Mana have long known when to step aside. ""We are fortunate we had shifted to lower locations; otherwise, many people could have been trapped,"" said Pitambhar Molpha , the village headman.Each Nov, as the doors of the Badrinath temple close, the residents of Mana undertake their annual migration, leaving behind their homes and livelihoods to escape the harsh winter. They move to Gopeshwar, Jyotirmath, and Jhinkwan in Chamoli district. They return only when the Badrinath yatra is about to begin.The avalanche - just 500 metres from the village - was neither the first nor the last. ""Avalanches have been reported here in Feb and March before,"" Molpha said. ""At this time of year, workers are engaged in removing snow from the main routes. There is also an army camp near our village.""For those who leave, there is always the lingering question of what remains. Sandeep Aswal, who runs a tea stall - once known as the 'last tea stall of the country' and now rebranded as the 'first tea stall' - has watched tourists come and go, drawn by Mana's mystique. ""It is an unfortunate incident. Since the village is empty, we don't have any updates on whether the avalanche impacted the area. But we feel blessed that all 400 families had already moved,"" he said.","Each nov, as doors of badrinath temple close, residents of mana move to gopeshwar, jyotirmath, and jhinkwan.

Bihar assembly elections: Has Nitish Kumar lost his bargaining power?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-assembly-elections-has-nitish-kumar-lost-his-bargaining-power/articleshow/118633751.cms,"So, is there merit in opposition charge or can Nitish still dictate terms in alliance?

Can Nitish switch again?

Has the BJP has made another flip-flop difficult for Nitish?

NEW DELHI: Has Nitish Kumar lost the sheen and also the bargaining power that helped him dominate Bihar's political landscape for over two decades? The critics of Nitish Kumar say that the recent cabinet expansion, which saw 7 BJP MLAs join his ministry, is a clear indication of who is calling the shots in Bihar.The opposition in Bihar claims that the BJP has ""completely hijacked"" Nitish Kumar's JD(U) and is enjoying power by using the chief minister as a mask.""People should look into the background as to how many cases are against those who have been inducted into Bihar cabinet. This is the last cabinet expansion of the CM (Nitish Kumar). NDA will be finished in 2025. The CM is not able to be at the post. He is tired. He has been losing his credibility. The people of Bihar don't want a Khatara Gaadi (outdated vehicle) but a newer one,"" leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav said.""It was not a cabinet expansion of Bihar but of the BJP. JD(U) has been completely hijacked. The BJP wants to finish the JD(U). Many of the leaders are there in JD(U), but their hearts are with the BJP. The BJP wants to be a dominant force here, but their dream will remain a mere dream,"" the RJD leader added.Another strong critic of Nitish Kumar, former election strategist Prashant Kishor who has floated his own outfit Jan Suraaj Party, also lambasted the BJP for ""enjoying power while using Nitish Kumar as a mask."" The former JD(U) national vice-president claimed that ""loot of public money and assuaging some estranged castes"" were the intentions behind the cabinet expansion ""with hardly six months left for polls"".Both the BJP and the JD(U), two key constituents of ruling NDA, strongly rejected opposition's charge and launched a counterattack.The Janata Dal (United) said that the RJD (Rashtriya Janata Dal) will get so few seats in the Bihar assembly elections that its leader Tejashwi Yadav will not even get the status of leader of opposition. JD(U) national spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan Prasad said the RJD rule under Lalu Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi had left Bihar in dire straits and it was Nitish Kumar who worked to improve its condition on every development metrics.The JD(U) leader alleged that the people of Bihar still ""shudder"" thinking of the ""jungle raaj"" of the RJD rule, when numerous caste massacres occurred, and people were killed in broad daylight and were abducted for ransom.Union minister and BJP MP Giriraj Singh also attacked Tejashwi Yadav and said that ""choron ko sab najar aate hain chor."" (Thieves see everyone as thieves). ""There is a proverb used in villages 'choron ko sab najar aate hain chor'. Since Lalu Yadav's government was a government of 'gangsters' and hence they see others with the same lens,"" the BJP MP said.In the 2020 assembly elections, Nitish Kumar was reduced to being the junior partner in NDA for the first time as the BJP got more seats than the JD(U). Interestingly, it was another NDA constituent, the Lok Janshakti Party of Chirag Paswan that played a key role in this change of power dynamics by strategically fielding candidates against JD(U) and ensuring division of votes. However, the BJP kept its pre-poll promise and formed a government under Nitish Kumar.But the change in number dynamics once again sowed the seeds of unease between the two long-term allies. Nitish once again jumped the NDA ship and joined hands with Lalu Prasad's RJD, only to return back to the NDA fold ahead of 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Well, Nitish Kumar, who has already made so many alliance flip-flops, can definetly decide for another switch. But the big question is will he dare to do that again? While anything is possible in politics, but with his credibility already under stake - a decision to change alliance ahead of assembly elections will be very difficult for Nitish. Another moot question is will Tejashwi be willing to take him back in Mahagathbandhan and under what conditions? In all his earlier tie-ups with RJD, Nitish was the undisputed leader and Tejashwi his deputy.The BJP has been very focussed on Bihar ahead of the year-end assembly elections. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made 8 MPs from the state Union ministers after winning the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Bihar has gained the most in the last two Union budgets - getting several projects and central doles. Prime Minister Modi held a mega rally in Bhagalpur earlier this month which was literally the launch of NDA's election campaign in the state. The Prime Minister made a strong farmers' outreach from Bihar disbursing close to Rs 23,000 crore to nearly 100 million beneficiaries of Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana across the country. With so much of largesse from the Centre, it will be difficult for Nitish to think of and justify any alliance switch to the people of the state.Nitish Kumar, who has had a dominating presence in the state, is perhaps passing through the toughest phase of his political career. Rumours around his health have not helped the matters. Little wonder, Prashant Kishor, friend-turned-bitter critic of Nitish Kumar has thrown an open dare at the Bihar chief minister . ""I challenge Nitish Kumar to spell out the names of ministers in the state cabinet without looking at a piece of paper. If he thus demonstrates his mental soundness, I would give up politics and start working for him,"" Kishor said attacking the JD(U) chief.Assembly elections in the state is still many months away and it will be interesting to see how Nitish adapts to the changed ground realities.","Opposition in bihar claims that the bjp has ""completely hijacked"" nitish kumar's jd(u) nitish once again jumped the nda ship and joined hands with lalu prasad's rjd. Has the bjp made another flip-flop difficult for nitish? The bjp has been very focussed on bihar ahead of the year-end assembly elections.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118634232,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-974938,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Deputy SP Masuda Sajjan Singh said Jat's restaurant was used as a meeting point for the accused, where the victims were abused and filmed.In the Tonk case, one of the accused, identified as Nihal Akram, befriended the girl on Instagram and then filmed her in compromising positions. This triggered a chain of sexual exploitation, with six more boys, mostly teenagers, exploiting her in cafes, cars, and buildings.Kishangarh, known for its marble industry, came to a standstill during the bandh Friday over the abuse cases in Bijaynagar. In Ajmer, businesses, transport and markets are expected to remain closed Saturday after over 100 trade associations extended support for the bandh.","Protests over alleged sexual exploitation of at least six minor girls in rajasthan's bijayanagar and tonk have snowballed to other areas.

Above-normal heatwave days likely in March: IMD

NEW DELHI: The past month was the warmest Feb in India since record keeping commenced in the country in 1901 and the upcoming hot weather season (March-May) is likely to be warmer than normal in most parts of the country with a high number of heatwave days during the period, the IMD said on Friday.Both months of 2025 so far have figured among top three warmest on record, as Jan was the third warmest since 1901. Earlier, 2024 was declared the warmest year in records dating back to 1901.Back-to-back warm winter months and the forecast of above-normal heat in March may negatively impact winter crops such as wheat and rapeseed during their maturing phase. Forecast of higher-than-normal heatwave days may threaten the output in certain states where sowing was delayed.""Above-normal heatwave days are expected over Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, MP, Maharashtra, UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, Bengal, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and north Karnataka from March to May,"" said D S Pai, senior IMD scientist, while releasing the outlook for the hot weather season.India during February recorded 22.04 degree Celsius of mean temperature which was 1.34 degree C above normal. The month recorded the warmest minimum (night) temperature and the second warmest maximum (day) temperature since 1901.Among four homogeneous regions, this was the warmest-ever February in central India, the third-warmest in south India, fifth-warmest in northwest and ninth-warmest in east and northeast India. The mean temperature in central India was 24.6 degree C whereas it was 26.75 degree C in south India, 20.14 degree C in east & northeast India and 17.11 degree C during the month in northwest India.March is likely to be warmer too, with most parts of the country expecting above-normal temperatures both during the day and night. ""Monthly maximum (day) temperatures for March are likely to be above normal over most parts of India, except over some southernmost parts of peninsular India, where below normal maximum temperatures are likely,"" said the senior scientist.During March, above-normal heatwave days are likely over most parts of central India and adjoining northern parts of south peninsula and some areas of northwest and east India.Heatwaves pose significant risks to vulnerable populations, including the elderly, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions, leading to heatstroke, dehydration, and strain on infrastructure.","India during february recorded 22.04 degree celsius of mean temperature which was 1.34 degree c above normal.

NEW DELHI: In contrast to the general refrain that lawyers extract money from gullible clients ignorant about the legal processes, a private company successfully dodged payment of legal assistance fee to a lawyers' firm successfully by exploiting a little-known provision in Indian Partnership Act .'The Chennai Law Firm' had filed a suit against Reyvish Associates Pvt Ltd seeking recovery of over Rs 6.5 lakh legal fees due to it for legal assistance rendered to the company. A Chennai city civil court directed the company to pay up the money with 12% interest.The company challenged this order before the Chennai principal judge in the district court and argued that the law firm was an unregistered one and hence cannot file a recovery suit against any party. The principal judge accepted the argument, reversed the trial court decree and ordered that no suit could have been filed by the unregistered partnership firm of lawyers.Madras HC, refused to entertain an appeal by the law firm saying as the payment arose from a contract, the lawyers' firm could not have filed a suit because of the bar under Section 69(2) of Partnership Act, which provided that - ""No suit to enforce a right arising from a contract shall be instituted in any court by or on behalf of a firm against any third party unless the firm is registered and the persons suing are or have been shown in the register of firms as partners"".In the appeal before Supreme Court bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh, the law firm argued that the lawyer's fee is a statutory due and hence was recoverable through a suit. The bench disagreed. Justice Kant said, ""HC and the lower appellate court are right that you are an unregistered partnership firm, which does not have the right to recover dues by filing suits.

The group had harassed her to pay higher than stipulated wages and stopped others from working at the kiln, disregarding even a Kerala HC order restraining them from disrupting operations.The change came about on a day TOI reported how this six-year-old business started by Pushpakumari and her husband Thankappan, a retired employee of the state transport corporation, had been forced to submit to the old scourge of unionism in the Left-governed state.Forced to shut their kiln for two days following threats and unreasonable wage demands from headload workers owing allegiance to the CPM-affiliated CITU and Congress' trade union wing INTUC, the couple was contemplating winding up their business. ""Per the high court order, we will ensure protection to them if there is any law-and-order issue. We will not allow anybody to disrupt their business,"" said SI Harsha Kumar.Former Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar was among those who criticised the Pinarayi Vijayan-led LDF govt for failing to protect entrepreneurship.Pushpakumari said she and her husband would reopen their kiln now that police had come out to protect them.

JAMMU: Incessant rains continued to lash Jammu for the third straight day on Friday, leading to the deaths of a mother-son duo and halting traffic on the strategic Jammu-Srinagar National highway due to piles of snow, landslides, slush and boulders. The rains had caused three deaths on Thursday, taking the total to five in the past 24 hours.Early Friday, Shano Devi (50) and her son Raghu (25) died when a boulder rolled down and hit their two-wheeler in Moungari area of Udhampur district, officials said.Elsewhere, 12 workers were rescued from the flood fury. “Around 11 labourers were rescued from Ujh river in Rajbagh area of Kathua,” an official said, adding they were putting up a shed near a construction site when they were suddenly marooned in the flash floods. Police and SDRF teams rescued a truck driver trapped in floods in Niki Tawi area of Jammu.The situation on the Srinagar highway remained grim. “No fresh traffic was allowed owing to accumulation of snow between Ramsoo and Qazigund, shooting of stones, landslides and mudslides at various places between Nashri and Banihal. Traffic was suspended around 7pm Thursday, leaving hundreds of vehicles stranded,” an official said.Batote-Doda road was also closed due to landslides, while Bhaderwah-Chamba road, Mughal road and Sinthan road were shut due to snow, traffic police posted on X. “Inclement weather affected helicopter services to Sanjichhat ( Vaishno Devi shrine) from Katra on Friday.

NEW DELHI: Himachal Pradesh leader of opposition Jairam Thakur hit out at the Congress government accusing it of pressuring temples under its control to contribute funds for the 'Sukh Ashray' scheme, a government welfare initiative.Taking to social media platform X, former CM Thakur claimed that 36 major temples managed by the state have been asked to provide financial assistance for running the scheme. He alleged that while the Sukhu-led government ""opposes Sanatana Dharma and makes anti-Hindu statements,"" it is now seeking temple funds to sustain its flagship program.In a video message, Thakur further alleged that district administrations were coercing temple trusts to transfer money to the government treasury. “A secretary in the Himachal Pradesh government has issued a letter to deputy commissioners, directing them to collect funds from temple trusts and deposit them in the treasury to finance government schemes. This is unprecedented and unacceptable,” he said.Thakur asserted that previous governments had only sought contributions from temples in times of natural disasters, but this move to divert funds for regular welfare programs was unprecedented. “They are not just requesting funds; they are actively following up and applying pressure. This decision must be opposed. Temple trusts and committees should resist this move,” he urged.The Sukh Ashray scheme aims to provide better opportunities for orphans, single and destitute women, and the elderly. In a letter dated January 29, the Art, Language, and Culture Department formally requested temple trusts to contribute to the Mukhya Mantri Sukh Ashray Yojna/Kosh and Mukhya Mantri Sukh Shiksha Yojna/Kosh as part of their charitable activities.Jairam Thakur vowed to strongly oppose the decision in the upcoming Vidhan Sabha session starting February 10 and beyond. “We will fight this both inside and outside the assembly,” he said, reiterating BJP’s stance against the move.Himachal Pradesh Congress chief Pratibha Singh responded to allegations by Jairam Thakur regarding the state government's request for funds from temples to finance the Sukh Ashray scheme.Singh said that the government was running the Sukh Ashray scheme to support the education of helpless children and to give them a better life. She further stated that the scheme was for a good cause.Speaking to ANI, Singh assured that the scheme's intent was noble, stating, ""Our government is running the Sukh-Aashray scheme for a good cause. This scheme was launched for the helpless children, to support their education and give them a better life...""She further said that the money was not just being used to run the finances of the temple and the government had called everyone to donate amount for the welfare of the children.""It is not only about temples. We are calling everyone who can to come and donate an amount for the welfare of the children. Organisations other than temples should also come forward and contribute to the good cause..."" she further stated.","Himachal pradesh leader of opposition jairam thakur hit out at the congress government.
