NEW DELHI: In a move to address the menace of loose items, such as soil, construction materials and municipal waste, often falling from both uncovered or tarpaulin-covered trucks, the govt will soon make it mandatory for these vehicles to have “mechanised covering” — automated or machine-assisted methods for covering.This will be part of the updated Truck Body Code. Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari has said the code will be notified soon. Officials said the changes to the code have been adopted by a committee under the road transport ministry that has representatives from the industry as well. TOI has learnt that the truck-manufacturing industry has sought two years to implement the code while the govt is keen to roll it out in the next one year.There have been several Supreme Court orders directing proper covering of trucks carrying loose and protruding loadsbut there has been little compliance due to poor enforcement.Officials said the Automotive Industry Standards (AIS)-093, dealing with the code has been published. This addresses issues related to unsafe body building practices, structural weaknesses, overloading, instability and non-uniform vehicle dimensions. The AIS provisions for minimum safety standards, structural integrity, dimensional uniformity and roadworthiness of truck bodies built on approved chassis.Officials said the revised code will incorporate the requirement of AC driver cabin, advanced driver assistance systems for improving safety, and updated provisions for under-run protection devices.",The truck-manufacturing industry has sought two years to implement the code.

The art of listening in a noisy world,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-art-of-listening-in-a-noisy-world/articleshow/127273399.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. I was at the wedding ceremony of a relative. One of those rare weddings with an early morning muhurtham , where brunch is still an hour away. Relatives who otherwise communicate only through forwarded messages on WhatsApp, slowly formed a circle. There was genuine warmth, laughter and enquiries . Then a teenager murmured an alert, almost like a warning: “Manju aunty.” Half the teenagers vanished with remarkable coordination. Manju aunty is, by all accounts, a loving and well-meaning person. The problem is volume—of words. Excessive talking would be an understatement. It is as though God, while assembling her, forgot to install a filter between thought and speech. She joined the circle, entirely unmindful of the sudden stillness. Her eyes landed on a teenage girl who had not escaped in time. Turning to the girl’s mother, she asked loudly, “Did you forget to feed her? Why is she so thin? Does she think this is some fashion?” Without waiting for an answer, she launched into how well she had fed her own daughter—and how that, naturally, led to a smooth ‘ normal delivery’ . The women who had undergone caesarean sections shifted uncomfortably, eyes lowered, dignity bruised in silence . Her gaze then fell on a Class IV boy and asked his rank in class. When the boy replied there was no ranking system anymore, she smiled indulgently and explained how her son always stood first though, thanks to her strict control. As her words poured out, relentless as autumn leaves falling from a tree, the gathering began to dissolve. Someone urgently needed the restroom. Someone else had to check on their child. A phone rang. Soon, only Manju aunty remained, speaking uninterrupted, and an elderly grandmother who could not hear a word anyway. We have all met Manju aunties in our lives. People who love to talk. When they call you, you immediately panic. If you pick up, your next 20 minutes is gone. If you don’t, you will have to hear about the habit of not answering calls the next time you meet. One thing often common among such persistent speakers is judgement. An unspoken “I know better” . What they lose—without realising it—is the chance to learn. Listening is not merely waiting for one’s turn to speak; it is an act of humility. Wisdom often arrives softly. It does not shout to be heard. Silence, contrary to popular belief, is not emptiness. It is strategy. The silent observer learns far more about the one who speaks without pause than the speaker ever learns about the listener. That is why Plato observed, “Wise men speak when they have something to say; fools speak because they have to say something.” The world today celebrates constant expression—opinions aired instantly; reactions broadcast without reflection. Yet the power lies not in saying everything, but in knowing what deserves to be said. Thiruvalluvar captured this with disarming simplicity: “Solluga sollir payanuḍaiya; Sollarka Sollil payanillach chol.” If speak you will, speak words that are fruitful; If speak you will, speak never fruitless words. The Kural does not glorify silence blindly. It demands responsibility from speech. Words must justify themselves. If they wound, belittle, inflate ego, or merely fill space, silence would have served better.","Thirukkural with the times explores real-world lessons from the classic tamil text.

Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the bench, said that the Bombay high court erred in quashing its decision of declaring the account ""fraud.""Goyal was arrested by ED in Sept 2023 on charges of laundering money and siphoning off loans worth Rs 538.6 crore extended to Jet Airways.Goyal's counsel submitted that the HC order was on the basis of concession given by the bank and it couldn't be challenged by it in SC.

NEW DELHI: Fresh controversy has surfaced around the cancellation of Indian cricketer Smriti Mandhana ’s wedding with singer-composer Palaash Muchhal, following serious allegations made by actor-producer Vidnyan Mane. Mane has accused Muchhal of infidelity and financial misconduct, claiming he was cheated of more than Rs 40 lakh in connection with an unreleased film project. A formal complaint has been filed in Sangli, Maharashtra.Smriti and Muchhal were initially scheduled to tie the knot on November 23, 2025. The wedding was first postponed citing health emergencies in both families before being officially called off in December 2025.In an interview with Hindustan Times, the 34-year-old alleged that the relationship between Mandhana and Muchhal broke down after a shocking incident during wedding festivities in November 2025.“I was at the wedding celebrations (November, 23, 2025) when he was caught red-handed with another woman in bed. Bhayanak scene tha, he was beaten up by the Indian female cricketers. The entire family is chindi chor. I thought he’d get married and settle in Sangli, but it has completely backfired on me.”Mane further claimed he is a childhood friend of Smriti Mandhana and was introduced to Muchhal through her family.Mane also levelled allegations of financial coercion against the Muchhal family, stating that he was pressured to invest additional money into a stalled film project.“When I met his mother (Amita Muchhal) last month, she said the budget to release the movie has now increased to ?1.5 crore. They asked me to invest another Rs 10 lakh or I wouldn’t get any money back. They started blackmailing me and threatened to throw me out of the film, thus I was forced to file a complaint,” he said.According to Mane, communication with the family stopped entirely after the wedding was cancelled.“After the wedding was called off, the family blocked me from everywhere. I found out that other artistes from the movie had not received payment they were due to receive either. I had heard of directors fleecing producers in the film industry but this is complete theft,” he added.Mane also asserted that he has evidence to back his claims. “I have saved all proofs including my chats and phone conversations that I’m willing to share with the police and the media,” he said.Muchhal later issued a response through an Instagram story, firmly denying all accusations. ""In light of the allegations made by Sangli-based Vidnyan Mane on social media, I wish to state that these claims against me are entirely baseless and factually incorrect. They have been made with malicious intent to tarnish my reputation, and they will not go unchallenged. My lawyer, Shreyansh Mithare, is exploring all legal avenues, and this matter will be dealt with strictly through the appropriate legal channels,” Muchhal wrote.Amid widespread speculation over the reasons behind the split, both parties later issued separate statements confirming the cancellation. Smriti stated that she needed to “clarify that the wedding is called off” and requested privacy, while Muchhal said, “I have decided to move on in my life and step back from my personal relationship. Its been very difficult for me to see people react so easily on baseless rumours about something which has been most sacred to me. Its the most difficult phase of my life and I will deal with it gracefully holding on to my beliefs.”",Smriti mandhana and palaash muchhal's wedding was called off in december 2025.

NEW DELHI: Light rain and a thunderstorm on Friday provided slight relief from pollution in the national capital, but air quality remained in the “poor” category, with the AQI recorded at 297 at 7 am, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Light rain also lashed Ghaziabad and Noida.This marked a marginal improvement from Thursday morning, when the AQI had been in the “very poor” category at 312.Several parts of the national capital continued to register poor air quality, with Anand Vihar at 317, Ashok Vihar 335, Wazirpur 351, Punjabi Bagh 326, RK Puram 315, Bawana 342, ITO 266, Chandni Chowk 326, and Dwarka Sector 8 316, the CPCB reported.Meanwhile, the temperature in Delhi was around 16.4°C at 7 am, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Under the AQI classification, readings are categorised as follows: 0–50 ‘Good’, 51–100 ‘Satisfactory’, 101–200 ‘Moderate’, 201–300 ‘Poor’, 301–400 ‘Very Poor’, and 401–500 ‘Severe’.Thursday had been unusually warm, with the mercury soaring to 27.1°C, about seven degrees above normal, marking the warmest January day in seven years.The high temperature was attributed to persistent warm easterly winds and clear skies, which increased sunshine hours.“Westerly winds are cold, while easterly winds are warm during this time of the year,” a weather official explained.With multiple spells of rain expected on Friday, the temperature is likely to drop. Officials said the maximum temperature is forecast to fall to 18-20°C on Friday and further to 16-18°C on Saturday.The rainy spells, accompanied by cloud cover, are also expected to bring down Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) to the poor category on Friday and to moderate by Saturday, if the predictions hold true.The IMD has issued a yellow alert for rain across the city. “Another round of very light to light rain is likely towards the afternoon or evening on Friday,” officials added, advising residents to remain cautious of strong winds and localized thunderstorms.A day earlier, the Sub-Committee on the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) revoked all Stage III measures across Delhi-NCR with immediate effect on January 22, following improvements in air quality and favorable forecast trends.A statement from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change said: “The Sub-Committee had invoked Stage III of GRAP on January 16, 2026, after a deterioration in Delhi’s average AQI.” Since then, air quality has shown a downward trend. According to the daily AQI Bulletin from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the average AQI improved from 378 on January 20 to 330 on January 21 and 322 on January 22.Considering this improving trend, and based on air quality and meteorological forecasts from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), the CAQM Sub-Committee convened today to review the situation.","Light rain and a thunderstorm on friday provided slight relief from pollution in the national capital.

Amit Shah Vs Oppn Showdown: Bill To Remove PM, CMs Over Criminal Cases Sparks Big Lok Sabha Ruckus

Experts: 30-day bar not aligned with current procedure

NEW DELHI: An expansive anti -corruption bill has drawn criticism from a legal think tank and two law universities, which told a parliamentary committee that provisions linking the removal of a PM, CM, or minister to 30 days of arrest on serious criminal charges risk political misuse.Representatives of Vidhi Centre for Legal policy, National Law University (NLU)- Odisha and National University of Juridical Sciences (NUJS)- Kolkata, who were invited by the joint parliamentary committee scrutinising the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill, flagged a host of issues, including that it may override popular will.Two of them suggested the threshold for removal should be ""framing of charges"" as it will introduce an element of judicial scrutiny in the process, people in the know said. Vidhi Centre cautioned that certain provisions may invite constitutional challenges.It said the purported intent behind the bill is laudable and largely complies with constitutional doctrine.Representatives of two of these bodies pointed out that the global consensus, at least in established democracies, for removal of ministers from office is judicial conviction and the proposed law moves away from this and has a low threshold.Existing criminal provisions allow police to seek custody of an accused for up to 90 days in serious offences, and the 30-day bar is not congruent with the current procedure, it was noted.NUJS said the legislation may intend to curb criminality within politics, but it has a “high probability” of severely destabilising Union and state cabinets, sources aware of the details said. The varsity said it has potential to lead to policy paralysis at Centre and states.An investigation can turn into a “potential regime change operation,” NLU said, adding that the bill incentivises retaliation as state police can act against a visiting Union minister after central agencies take action against a chief minister or state minister.Vidhi Centre said, “The framework creates scope for political misuse. Arrests may be timed or selectively pursued.”NLU echoed similar views, saying opposing parties can use its provisions to destabilise legitimate govts. The trend over the past few decades suggests the possibility of its misuse and it will have a negative impact on the country’s democracy, it said. “Automatic removal of a PM or CM overrides the choice of the majority party and the voters,” it said.Though the bill seeks removal from office over arrest in offences where punishment is five years or more, it was also pointed out that there are several serious crimes, including corruption, where punishment may be less than five years.The govt has batted for the bill citing instances of ministers and even a chief minister — Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi — continuing to be in charge despite being under a long period of incarceration on corruption charges. However, it agreed to send the bill to the parliamentary panel headed by BJP MP Aparajita Sarangi for wider consultations. Most opposition parties have refused to be part of the panel.","Vidhi centre for legal policy, national law university (nlu)- odisha and national university of juridical sciences (nujs)- kolkata flagged a host of issues.

Tharoor Snubs Congress, Skips Key Meeting; Zelensky Announces First US-Russia-Ukraine Talks

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor did not attend the meeting of Kerala state leadership with AICC high command Friday amid reports that he is upset over a recent ""snub"", even as the party stepped up planning for the upcoming state polls scheduled for mid-2026 and urged netas to put up a united fight.AICC chief Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi met important netas of the Kerala unit for discussion on poll campaign strategy and seat-sharing with allies.Among those who took part in the session were AICC general secretary K C Venugopal, special poll observer Sachin Pilot, senior neta Ramesh Chennithala, state president Sunny Thomas, LoP V D Satheesan, MPs Kodikunnil Suresh, Adoor Prakash, among others. However, Tharoor did not attend despite an invitation.The Thiruvananthapuram MP was in Kozhikode for Kerala Literature Festival where, sources said, he had a lecture scheduled on an important social reformer. Sources said he had informed the party about his inability to attend the meeting. However, Tharoor is said to be upset that Rahul did not acknowledge him while he mentioned other netas on the dais during Kochi ""mahapanchayat"" organised after UDF's victory in local body elections.Tharoor is said to have told the party about his unhappiness about the ""snub"".To media queries, party's state incharge Deepa Dasmunshi denied that Tharoor was unhappy with Congress.The events before Kochi had suggested a thaw between Tharoor and the party, after the MP's repeated statements and political stance over myriad issues had embarrassed the Congress brass. The repeated clashes between him and Congress had even triggered speculations that Tharoor was searching for political space outside Congress.For Kerala polls, Congress is also discussing the return of estranged ally Kerala Congress (Mani). The party has to decide whether MPs will be fielded in state polls, even as it is almost final that most of the MLAs will be repeated.

SRINAGAR\JAMMU: Snowfall and savage winds up to 155kmph pulverised J&K on Friday, blocking highways, causing flight cancellations, shutting down schools, disrupting power, leaving homes roofless and forcing the suspension of Vaishno Devi pilgrimage.In the Valley, IMD reported snowfall of 55cm in Shopian, 45cm in Gulmarg, 20cm in Kupwara, 17cm in Pahalgam, 16cm in Banihal, and 15cm in Sonamarg as the weather system fed by western disturbances began its onslaught late Thursday night.In Jammu, Trikuta Hills, home to Shri Mata Vaishno Devi’s cave shrine, received the first snowfall of the season alongside Doda, Kishtwar, Ramban, and Poonch. “Light to moderate rains lashed several other areas,” an official said in Jammu.The rough spell will linger. According to Mukhtar Ahmad, director of Srinagar’s Met department, a second burst of western disturbance is likely on Jan 26, preceded by light to heavy rainfall on Jan 24 and 25.Vehicular movement was stopped in both directions on the all-important Jammu-Srinagar National Highway due to fresh snowfall around Navyug Tunnel. Several other roads were blocked.At Srinagar airport, no flights moved on Friday. IndiGo said both take-offs and landings had been suspended due to snowfall.“We are closely monitoring the weather and will get you on your way as soon as conditions allow,” the airline added.Power and transmission lines took a beating. Chief minister Omar Abdullah warned of massive losses. “We can figure losses from this point that active power load in the Valley is less than 100 MW today (Friday) against the usual 1700 MW.

In Srinagar’s busy Lal Chowk, battered roof sheets fell and piled up near Clock Tower, bringing traffic to a standstill. Similar scenes were reported from other Valley areas.“The roofs were not anchored properly to the walls,” former Kashmir chief town planner Iftikhar Hakeem said. Architect Sameer Hamdani echoed the view. “Many roofs are constructed as temporary structures, especially in shopping complexes where owners intend to add a floor,” Hamdani said.In Jammu, authorities ordered school closures in Rajouri, Reasi, Poonch and Udhampur for the safety of students and staff.

BJP Targets Mamata Banerjee Over ED Raid At I-PAC, Alleges Evidence Tampering

NEW DELHI: SC Thursday refused to restrain ED from accessing information from the mobile phone of I-PAC functionary Jitendra Mehta, which was seized during a search on Jan 8 at the political consultancy firm's Delhi office. Mehta has been summoned for questioning at the ED headquarters on Friday.Appearing before a bench headed by CJI Surya Kant, senior advocate C A Sundaram said allowing Enforcement Directorate to open the phone would violate Mehta's privacy and pleaded that ED be restrained from doing so till the next date of hearing on Tuesday. But the bench asked him ""why are you so afraid"".Sundaram said the apex court should intervene to protect his fundamental right, but the bench said, ""We know how to protect an innocent citizen"". The advocate then remarked that the court was presuming his guilt.While ED seized digital devices from I-PAC's Delhi office during its Jan 8 search operation, it could not do the same in Kolkata as the West Bengal Police brass interrupted the search proceedings on the firm's premises in the presence of TMC chief and CM Mamata Banerjee . Documents and digital devices seized by ED officers in Kolkata were taken away from them.The CJI-led bench also clubbed all matters related to the restraint put on ED to access phones and digital devices of other money laundering case accused and scheduled a hearing for Tuesday.Sources said the other cases in which ED has been restrained by SC from accessing digital data of an accused includes matters related to lottery king Santiago Martin's Future Gaming, NewsClick, Foundation for Media Professionals, Amazon Seller Services Pvt Ltd, and the Tamil Nadu govt.Also read: 'To expand like Gujarat'- PM Modi's big prediction on BJP's rise in Kerala

""In the above cases it was argued that current laws were inadequate and that allowing the agency to access personal devices infringe upon the fundamental right to privacy under Article 21 and the right against self-incrimination under Article 20(3) of the Constitution,"" a source said.The accused facing ED probe had sought SC to frame guidelines for search and seizure of devices by enforcement agencies since devices also contained personal data.In Nov 2023, SC directed govt to draft guidelines. The govt had sought time, and later, MHA formed a panel headed by director I4C for formulating guidelines to curb the indiscriminate seizure of digital devices.

NEW DELHI: In a significant breakthrough, security forces on Friday neutralised a top Pakistani terrorist of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) outfit in an encounter in Kathua district, police said.""A Pakistani Jaish terrorist has been neutralised by a small JKP team in a joint operation with the Army and CRPF in the general area of Billawar,"" IGP Jammu posted on X.“Acting on specific intelligence inputs, a joint operation was launched by the Army and Police on January 23 in the general area of Parhetar. The area was cordoned and contact established.

A large quantity of arms and ammunition, including an M4 automatic rifle, was recovered from him during the operation in a remote village in the Parhetar area.Usman was one of the most wanted JeM terrorists active in the Udhampur-Kathua belt for the past two years after infiltrating into India from across the border.He had escaped several previous encounters, the latest being on January 7 and 13 in the Kahog and Najote forests, respectively.Meanwhile, security forces continue a separate anti-terror operation to hunt down three JeM terrorists in Sonnar, Mandral-Singhpora, and adjoining forest areas in the Chatroo belt of Kishtwar district for the sixth consecutive day on Friday.Named by the Army as ‘Operation Trashi-I’, the mission was launched on January 18. The gunfight has so far claimed one paratrooper’s life, while seven soldiers were injured, primarily due to splinter injuries caused by a sudden grenade attack by the hiding terrorists.After a four-day lull, another encounter took place on Thursday, but the terrorists managed to escape, taking advantage of thick vegetation and challenging terrain.Operations have been further intensified ahead of Republic Day to ensure peaceful celebrations, amid intelligence inputs about attempts by Pakistan-based handlers to push more terrorists into the region","Security forces on friday neutralised a top pakistani terrorist of the pakistan-based jaish-e-mohammed (jem) outfit in an encounter in kathua district.

PM Modi Declares Countdown For DMK Exit, Calls It A Government Of Corruption, Mafia, And Crime

'Our leaders stood by devotees': PM

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Friday hit back at Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's call for a “double engine” government, saying it would not work in the state.Stalin was responding to Modi’s remarks at an NDA rally in Maduranthakam earlier today, where the Prime Minister launched the alliance’s campaign for the 2026 Assembly elections and said, “We have to free Tamil Nadu from the clutches of the DMK .” PM also argued for a “double engine” government that would work “shoulder to shoulder” with the Centre for Tamil Nadu’s growth.In a post on X, Stalin said, “The double engine that the PM talks about will not run in Tamil Nadu.” He added that the state had seen “historical growth by overcoming all the obstacles created by the BJP government at the Centre.”“Think about it for a moment… more than the double engine states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar that you talk about, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Telangana, Karnataka and West Bengal, where the double engine has not entered, are registering growth,” Stalin said.The Tamil Nadu CM accused the BJP of betraying Tamil Nadu and said people would not forget it. “Even if you hide the betrayals committed by the BJP against Tamils and Tamil Nadu, the people of the state will never forget them. Tamil Nadu will not bow to Delhi’s arrogance,” he said.Addressing a large gathering of NDA workers and supporters, PM accused the ruling DMK of corruption and misgovernance. He coined the term “CMC” to describe the party, saying it stood for “Corruption, Mafia, Crime”.“The DMK is CMC — a Corruption, Mafia, Crime promoting government. The people of Tamil Nadu have made up their mind to uproot DMK, CMC,” he said.The prime minister claimed the DMK government’s “countdown has started” and said Tamil Nadu wanted to be free of what he called “misgovernance” and was looking towards the BJP-led NDA for “good governance”.He also accused the DMK of indulging in vote-bank politics, including over the Thirupparankundram Lord Murugan Temple Karthigai lamp lighting issue. “Our leaders stood by devotees’ rights, but the DMK left no stone unturned for vote bank politics,” he said.Alleging that the DMK functioned only for one family, Modi said, “The DMK government has nothing to do with democracy and accountability.”He also raised concerns about crime and drugs in the state, saying youth were falling prey to narcotics and women were suffering due to crime. Recalling former chief minister J Jayalalithaa, Modi said, “Selvi J Jayalalithaa did great work in controlling crime in Tamil Nadu, but today women are suffering.”",Stalin was responding to modi’s remarks at an nda rally in maduranthakam.

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party on Friday targeted Congress amid the ongoing internal tussle, especially after top party leader indirectly called Shashi Tharoor ""irrelevant"".

But one thing is clear : whoever keeps country above family gets sidelined in congress - I’m an example of this,"" he added.Earlier in the day, Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit reacted to why Thiruvananthapuram MP skipped the Kerala party meet saying, ""All the strong and senior leaders from Kerala are attending. Those who are relevant to the Congress are coming,"" he said.Tharoor, who is said to be displeased that Rahul Gandhi did not meet him during his Kochi visit, will attend the Kerala Literature Festival instead.According to a PTI report, sources close to him said he was ""very upset"" with how the party has treated him, particularly after earlier differences were believed to have been resolved during the Wayanad meetings held alongside the KPCC’s Lakshya 2026 leadership camp to plan strategy for the forthcoming assembly elections.Speculation about a rift between Tharoor and the party gained traction after a sequence of developments that observers interpreted as signs of the senior leader’s growing dissatisfaction with his role within the Congress.Tensions between Shashi Tharoor and the Congress appeared to deepen after he skipped a crucial party meeting on the eve of last year’s Winter Session of Parliament, a move widely read as a sign of strain. Moreover, Tharoor has openly questioned the space he occupies within the organisation and the expectations the party has of him.He has also spoken publicly about what he described as a leadership vacuum in the Kerala Congress, and later met Rahul Gandhi to seek clarity on his own position within the party structure. These interventions, rather than settling matters, added to speculation about an uneasy relationship.","‘maha yuddh in maha panchayat?’ bjp trolls congress over tharoor remark, suggests ‘board of peace’ shehzad poonawalla went on to list several reported internal tussles in the party.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127260662,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1141217,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

'Will Come to Mumbai, Try Cutting My Legs: Annamalai Hits Back at Raj Thackeray

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) president Raj Thackeray posted a cryptic social media message on Friday, saying that if he ever took a “flexible stance” in politics, it would never be driven by ""personal gain.""His remarks came on the 100th birth anniversary of his uncle, Bal Thackeray, the founder of the undivided Shiv Sena . Raj Thackeray left the Sena in 2005 and launched the MNS the following year.The MNS chief posted on X in Marathi, ""Today loyalties are easily sold off. Principles are casually discarded, and politics has become entirely opportunistic. In today's politics, success is measured not by which issues were brought to the forefront or how fiercely regional and linguistic identities were kept alive, but by how much success was achieved in electoral politics and what tricks are employed to get there. """"In Balasaheb's time, there were no such compromises with expectations like these...He himself had no craving for power...Even when Balasaheb had to take a flexible stance in politics at times, his love for the Marathi people never diminished even by a fraction; on the contrary, it only grew stronger. These are the values instilled in us,"" he wrote.Thackeray added that he is giving his word that if he ever took a ""slightly flexible stance in this completely transformed politics,"" it would ""never be for my personal gain or selfish interests.""His statement comes two days after five MNS corporators extended support to Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde 's Shiv Sena in the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) in the Thane district.The move raised eyebrows, as the party had contested the January 15 civic polls alongside the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT) in several municipal corporations across the state, including the KDMC and Mumbai. The MNS-Sena (UBT) alliance had reunited Raj with Uddhav, Bal Thackeray's son and former Maharashtra chief minister, after 20 years of estrangement.Shiv Sena (UBT) is a faction of the previously undivided Shiv Sena, the other being the Shinde-led group. The party split in June 2022, resulting in the two factions, with the Shinde camp recognised by the Election Commission as the ""real"" Shiv Sena. The split also led to the collapse of the Uddhav Thackeray-led state government.","Mns chief raj thackeray posted a cryptic social media message on friday.

5 girls booked under UP anti-conversion law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-girls-booked-under-up-anti-conversion-law/articleshow/127342164.cms,".

BAREILLY: An FIR has been registered under Section 3 of the stringent Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act against five minor Muslim girls -- aged between 15 and 17 -- for allegedly getting their 16-year-old Hindu friend to wear a burqa in Moradabad.The incident took place on Dec 12, 2025, but has come to light now after police said that they’ve registered a case following a complaint by the girl’s brother, Daksh Chaudhary, on Friday.If found guilty under this law, an accused, especially if the victim is a minor, can be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term “which shall not be less than 5 years but which may extend to 14 years”.Superintendent of police (rural) in Moradabad, Kunwar Akash Singh, told TOI, “As soon as we received the complaint, a First Information Report (FIR) was registered and further investigation is on.”Section 3 of the anti-conversion law deals with “prohibition of conversion from one religion to another by misrepresentation, force, fraud, undue influence, coercion, and allurement”.“My sister was talking to one of the girls whom she’d met about two months back and had been going out regularly with. The five girls who took away my sister in burqa had may have had some ill intention. So, I approached cops at Bilari police station,” Chaudhary, the complainant, told TOI.A purported video of the incident was widely circulated on social media.In the minute-long video clip, the girls can be seen in a narrow alley between houses. One of them is seen wearing a burqa over her dress with the other girls trying to help her.“The accused girls and the Hindu girl are friends. All are believed to be minors. That afternoon, they were on their way to a restaurant which crosses the victim’s brother’s shop. They didn’t want him to know about it. Fearful of getting caught, the Hindu girl may have worn her friends’ burqa,” said a police officer, privy to the case.He added that since it is a sensitive matter, the local police registered a case following the complaint filed by the family members.“Further investigation is on to find out the backgrounds of the young girls and their motive, if any, behind the incident,” the officer said. As they are minors, police said, they cannot be immediately put the girls in custody.","The incident took place on dec 12, 2025, but has come to light now after police said that they’ve registered a case following a complaint by the girl’s brother, daksh chaudhary, on friday.
