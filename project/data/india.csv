"Rapid test kits for Hepatitis B, Sickle cell anemia to be available at PHCs, government decides",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rapid-test-kits-for-hepatitis-b-sickle-cell-anemia-to-be-available-at-phcs-government-decides/articleshow/122825931.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a big move to ensure timely detection of common diseases like Hepatitis B, sickle cell anemia and syphilis at primary level, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has suggested that rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to diagnose them should be available at rural health centres. This includes the Ayushman Arogya Mandirs Sub-Centres and primary health centres.Sources said the move follows feedback received from national programs and other subject experts, who highlighted the growing importance of providing rapid diagnostic tools at primary health facilities for early detection and treatment.Many RDTs available in the market have not been included for the want of robust evidence. Officials said these tests can be reconsidered for inclusion in the National Essential Diagnostics List (NEDL) once the required data is comprehensively assessed and verified, the officials said.The ICMR, which is the apex health research agency, released the NEDL in 2019 to set basic standards for availability of diagnostic facilities at health facilities in the country. Recently, it has been updated to include RDTs and other requirements.For example, the 2019 NEDL had kept certain diagnostic tests under the ""hub-and-spoke"" model at primary health centres (PHCs). A hub and spoke model in a laboratory setting is a healthcare delivery strategy where a central, well-equipped ""hub"" laboratory provides specialized diagnostic services, while smaller, less equipped ""spoke"" laboratories handle routine and less complex testing, with samples often transferred between the two.However, the updated equipment list which was released recently suggests these tests should be available at the PHCs itself. This will do away with the need for sample transfer to hubs thereby making it possible to diagnose and treat a wider array of conditions at the lower level, the ICMR says. The updated NEDL also addresses the issue of new nomenclature of healthcare facilities with Sub-Centres now referred to as Ayushman Arogya Mandirs.The revision of the National Essential Diagnostics List (NEDL) was undertaken through extensive engagement with a wide range of stakeholders. The process began with an open call on the ICMR website inviting suggestions on the existing Essential Diagnostics List. This was followed by four rounds of consultations to discuss the suggestions received with the relevant experts and stakeholders. Subsequently, the draft revised list was deliberated with representatives from State NHM and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The final list incorporated the feedback and recommendations received in all consultations, officials said.",The indian council of medical research (icmr) has suggested that rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) to diagnose them should be available at rural health centres.

NEW DELHI: Vice-president Jagdeep Dhankhar resigned from his post on Monday evening, citing medical reasons. His decision has opened the field for the selection of a new vice-president.In his resignation letter to President Droupadi Murmu , Dhankhar wrote: ""To prioritise health care and abide by medical advice, I hereby resign as vice-president of India, effective immediately, in accordance with Article 67(a) of the Constitution.""Dhankhar, 74, had taken office in August 2022. His term was to continue until 2027. As vice-president, he also held the position of Rajya Sabha chairman. His resignation came on the first day of the Monsoon session of Parliament.The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which holds a majority in the vice-presidential electoral college comprising members of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, was taken by surprise by the move. The ruling alliance is expected to discuss possible candidates in the coming days.The BJP is likely to choose a nominee from a broad pool that includes current governors, senior leaders from the party organisation, or serving Union ministers.Before becoming vice-president, Dhankhar was the governor of West Bengal.Dhankhar’s predecessor, M Venkaiah Naidu, was a former BJP president and a cabinet minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government when the party selected him for the vice-president’s post in 2017.Dhankhar’s three-year tenure saw several confrontations with opposition parties in the Rajya Sabha.“We are still processing it. But I believe the party will choose someone who is a solid choice and is non-controversial,” a BJP leader was quoted as saying by the PTI.Among those being discussed as possible choices is Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh, a Janata Dal (United) MP who has held the post since 2020. He is viewed as someone who enjoys the government’s trust.Dhankhar is the third vice-president of India after V V Giri and R Venkataraman to resign during his tenure. Both Giri and Venkataraman had stepped down from the vice-president’s post to contest the presidential election.As per rules, the election to fill the vice-president's post must be held within the next six months.

New Delhi: In a rare instance, SC Monday castigated Karnataka govt for pursuing prosecution against BJP MP Tejasvi Surya for a post on X, ED for a PMLA case against Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah 's wife and an NGO for a contempt plea against Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, and said courts are not platforms for politics.First was the turn of Karnataka govt which had filed an appeal against HC's decision to quash prosecution against Surya, who was accused of making a false claim about a farmer dying by suicide after his land was transferred to the state waqf board.Even before additional advocate general Aviskar Singhvi could place his argument justifying the filing of the appeal and necessity of prosecuting Surya, a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran said, ""Do not try to politicise issues before a court. Political battles are to be fought somewhere else. Go before the electorate and fight your political battles.""When Singhvi attempted to justify the filing of the appeal by the state against BJP neta, the bench softened him by saying any further argument would invite heavy cost. Singhvi accepted the dismissal of the state's petition without further demurrer.Next in line to be chastised was ED that had appealed against a Karnataka HC order quashing a case under the PMLA against BM Parvathi in the Muda case.Next was the turn of NGO Atmadeep, which had sought initiation of criminal contempt against Banerjee for her reported public statement that SC's judgment quashing the scam-riddled recruitment of teaching and non-teaching staff would not be implemented. The bench gave senior advocate Maninder Singh an advice similar to those given to the Karnataka govt and ED. However, Singh said since initiation of contempt proceedings would require the attorney general's consent, the petitioner has approached the top law officer and is awaiting his response. ""Are you sure you will get the response,"" the bench asked and adjourned hearing on the petition.",Karnataka govt pursued prosecution against bjp mp tejasvi surya for a post on x. ed appealed against a karnataka hc order quashing a case under the pmla against bm parvathi in the muda case.

It also quashed the summons issued to urban development minister B S Suresh, who was not named as an accused, but was called for questioning by ED.

MUMBAI: Heavy rain lashed Mumbai onMonday morning, crippling movement across key parts of the city.In the 24-hour period ending at 8 am on Monday, the island city recorded an average rainfall of 23.45 mm, the eastern suburbs received 36.42 mm and the western suburbs got 50.02 mm rainfall, civic officials said.In contrast, Colaba received just 11.2mm, highlighting the uneven distribution of showers across the city.The heavy overnight showers led to waterlogging at several low-lying areas in the city and suburbs.Commuters bore the brunt of the downpour, especially during the morning rush hour. The Andheri subway had to be closed due to severe waterlogging, causing further traffic snarls in the area.Motorists complained of slow traffic movement on both the Eastern Express Highway and the Western Express Highway due to rain and other reasons during the morning rush hours.Some commuters also complained that locals trains were running with a little delay.According to IMD officials, the rainfall is linked to a low-pressure system over the Bay of Bengal, which has intensified rain activity along Maharashtra’s coastal belt, including Mumbai and surrounding regions.While no red alert has been issued for Mumbai, the IMD has urged residents—especially office-goers and commuters—to exercise caution, particularly in the evening hours when isolated heavy showers are expected.For the next 24 hours, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast a generally cloudy sky with moderate spells of rain in Mumbai and suburbs, with the possibility of thunderstorms accompanied by lightning and gusty winds at isolated places.After a high tide of 3.91 metres at 9.19 am, another one of 3.38 metres was expected at 8.37 pm.

MUMBAI: Senior education officers in the Maharashtra govt have been accused of misusing a govt-run payments portal to create fake teacher IDs and siphoning funds. Fraudulent Shalarth IDs were also created for unqualified individuals, who were allegedly hired after paying a bribe of Rs 20 to 30 lakhs each to school management and education department officials.The IDs given when a teacher is recruited, are needed to access salary and other benefits. The deputy directors of education of Mumbai and Nagpur zones allegedly, between them, created thousands of fake IDs. Govt estimates the scope of the scam to be Rs 2,000-3,000 crore. Some arrests have already been madeFormer deputy director of education Ram Pawar explains, ""Once there is a vacancy and the school has selected the candidate, the school issues an appointment order. The candidate then takes this appointment order to the deputy director of education of that zone, who approves it and provides the candidate with a Shalarth ID and password. This ID is used to access salary and benefits—without it, the candidate cannot be paid. "" The Shalarth portal also houses financial information and personnel records for all education staffers.According to Ram Pawar, the authority to issue Shalarth IDs rests with the deputy director of education.Officials at the office have created bogus IDs and drawn salaries for fictitious individuals, for whom bank accounts were opened using fake credentials and fake photographs. Officials have also been accused of issuing Shalarth IDs and hiring unqualified people for posts of teachers and headmasters for a bribe.Scope for manipulation is minimal in govt-run schools as employment records are available for scrutiny within the administration and due to the regulations which staff need to follow. But govt oversight of the records of aided schools is limited. This allowed those managing the portal to appoint unqualified individuals and even create fake posts and withdraw salaries in their name.Misuse of the portal has been reported across the state. In Nagpur, unqualified teachers, headmasters, and other staff were accused of holding fake Shalarth IDs that were obtained after paying bribes to school management and education department staffers. Deputy director of education for Nagpur, Ulhas Narad, has been arrested. In many cases, teachers and other school staff helped govt officers to create fake IDs and bank accounts for a share of the loot. Also, govt staff demanded bribes to give eligible teachers backdated dues and increments after promotion (see report alongside).On July 18, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis announced in the state assembly that the Shalarth ID scam could amount to Rs 2,000-3,000 crore. He announced the formation of a Special Investigation Team to probe the ID scam. Dada Bhuse, the state school education minister, has meantime suspended the Mumbai deputy director, Sandeep Sangave.Former deputy director Ram Pawar says, ""An earnest effort must be made to examine records. The process cannot be top-down. Whatever the upper management decides, the onus must be on field officers who need to conduct rigorous checks.""","Shalarth ids are needed to access salary and other benefits.

NEW DELHI: The man, who saved the 15-year-old girl from Odisha's Puri district after she was set ablaze by unidentified men, recounted the harrowing 90 minutes after she knocked on his door, screaming for help, ""save me, save me. ""A 15-year-old girl, allegedly set on fire by three masked men in Odisha’s Puri district, was transferred to AIIMS New Delhi, where she remains in stable condition with 70-75%burn injuries.The class 9 dropout was walking to a relative’s home around 8.30am Saturday when she was reportedly intercepted near a river embankment, rendered unconscious by a chemical-lacedcloth, and doused with kerosene before being set ablaze.Screaming for help, she fled to a nearby house, where Dukshishyam Senapati extinguished the flames and gave her fresh clothes.Recalling the harrowing moment, Senapati said that when he answered his door, he was stunned to find the girl engulfed in flames and crying in agony, as he later explained to DGP YB Khurania during the official's site visit.""It was around 8.30 am when the girl came to my house, screaming. With the help of my wife, I doused the fire and gave her water as she was very thirsty.Later, the women of my family changed her clothes,"" he said.Upon questioning, the girl informed Senapati that three unidentified men had set her ablaze. She explained being abducted by motorcycle-riding assailants whilst returning from meeting a friend.""She said she was walking back home after meeting a friend when she was picked up by three men who arrived on motorcycles. The faces of these men were half-covered, and they took her to a place near the Bhargavi riverbank. She could not tell their names. She could only say that they covered her face with a handkerchief and poured some substance before setting her on fire,"" he said.Senapati noticed that although the girl mentioned being bound during the abduction, her hands were free when she arrived. After learning her father's details, he contacted her family. The large crowd that gathered prevented further conversation with the victim.Despite searching the area, Senapati couldn't locate the perpetrators. He explained that the attackers fled after setting her alight, presumably expecting her to perish. However, the girl managed to escape and reach his house.Due to delayed ambulance response, they resorted to an auto rickshaw for hospital transport. The girl remained at his residence for approximately 90 minutes.The incident has created fear in the village, particularly among children who are now afraid to venture out alone. Senapati urged swift arrest of the culprits.","Dukshishyam senapati saved the 15-year-old girl from odisha's puri district after she was set ablaze by unidentified men.

NEW DELHI: Holding Chanda Kochhar , former CEO of ICICI Bank , guilty of receiving bribes of Rs 64 crore through her husband from Videocon group, an appellate tribunal here in an order dated July 3 observed that the money was paid as quid-pro-quo for sanctioning a loan of Rs 300 crore to the Videocon group.“The history given by the appellants (ED) has been narrated and supported by the evidence in the light of the reference of the statements under Section 50 of the PMLA Act which are admissible and can be relied upon. The allegation made by the appellants stands because on paper ownership of NRPL is shown to be of V N Dhoot (CMD of Videocon group) but according to him also, the entire control of the company was of Deepak Kochhar (Chanda Kochhar’s husband). Thus, the allegations were made for quid-pro-quo to Chanda Kochhar for sanction of loan to Videocon group of industries,” the tribunal said in its order.The appellate tribunal slammed the adjudicating authority that had earlier in Nov 2020 given relief to the accused in releasing the attached assets worth Rs 78 crore.“The adjudicating authority has ignored the material facts while drawing the conclusions which are coming out on the face of the record and, therefore, we cannot endorse the finding of the adjudicating authority going against the record and ignoring the relevant facts.Thus, we find substance in the allegation of the appellants for quid-pro-quo to Chanda Kochhar for sanction of loan of Rs 300 crore to Videocon group and thereupon, a sum of Rs 64 crore was transferred to NRPL, a company managed by Deepak Kochhar and, in fact, he was the managing director of the said company. The factual issues narrated above clarifies that the appellants have taken up the matter to justify the attachment of the property,” the tribunal said, justifying the ED’s attachments.The tribunal noted that the sanction of a loan of Rs 300 crore by ICICI Bank to the Videocon group where Chanda Kochhar remained part of the committee was against the rules and policy of the bank. “The issue remains about the transfer of Rs 64 crore by Videocon group through its entity SEPL to NRPL day after the disbursement of loan by ICICI Bank,” it said while validating the evidence produced by the ED. The appellate tribunal also held Kochhar guilty of not disclosing her conflict of interest while sanctioning the loan.",An appellate tribunal observed that the money was paid as quid-pro-quo for sanctioning a loan of rs 300 crore to the videocon group.

Invoking criminal law for recovery of money is abuse of law: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/invoking-criminal-law-for-recovery-of-money-is-abuse-of-law-supreme-court/articleshow/122813710.cms,"Supreme Court

Poll Do you agree with the Supreme Court's view that FIRs for monetary disputes should not invoke criminal law? Yes, I agree No, I disagree

NEW DELHI: Invoking criminal law by filing an FIR for recovery of money by a person is an abuse of the process of law as it is a civil dispute, the Supreme Court said and expressed frustration over HCs allowing it in violation of its rulings.The apex court stated this while quashing criminal proceedings initiated by a production house against Bollywood filmmaker Shailesh Kumar Singh, who had produced ‘Tanu Weds Manu’, over a monetary dispute.“How many times HCs are to be reminded that to constitute an offence of cheating, there has to be something more than prima facie on record to indicate that the intention of the accused was to cheat the complainant right from the inception. The plain reading of FIR does not disclose any element of criminality,” a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said in an order on July 14.Indicating that HCs have virtually turned a deaf ear to its recent orders holding that such cases come within the ambit of civil suits, the bench referred to its verdicts which had settled the issue. It said SC in Aug had stated that a mere breach of contract cannot give rise to a criminal prosecution for cheating unless fraudulent or dishonest intention is shown right from the beginning of the transaction.“Every act of breach of trust may not result in a penal offence of criminal breach of trust unless there is evidence of a manipulating act of fraudulent misappropriation. An act of breach of trust involves a civil wrong in respect of which the person may seek his remedy for damages in civil courts but, any breach of trust with a mens rea, gives rise to a criminal prosecution as well,” it had said.Advocate Sana Raees Khan, appearing for producer Shailesh Kumar Singh, told the court that no criminal offence was made out against him and criminal prosecution should not be allowed to be used as an instrument of harassment. Agreeing with her, the bench quashed the FIR and also expressed shock on how the Allahabad HC dealt with the case by directing him to pay Rs 25 lakh to the complainant. SC also directed them to go for mediation.“We fail to understand why the HC should undertake such an exercise. The HC may either allow the petition saying that no offence is disclosed or may reject the petition saying that no case for quashing is made out. Why should the HC make an attempt to help the complainant to recover the amount due and payable by the accused. It is for the civil court or commercial court, as the case may be, to look into in a suit that may be filed for recovery of money or in any other proceedings,” SC said.“We are quite disturbed by the manner in which the HC has passed the impugned order. The HC first directed the appellant to pay Rs 25 lakh to the respondent, and thereafter, directed him to appear before the Mediation and Conciliation Centre for the purpose of settlement. That’s not what is expected of an HC to do in a writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution or a miscellaneous application filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing of FIR or any other criminal proceedings,” SC said.It said that “what is expected of the HC is to look into the averments and the allegations levelled in the FIR along with the other material on record, if any. The HC seems to have forgotten the well-settled principles as enunciated in the decision of this court”.",Supreme court: invoking criminal law by filing an fir for recovery of money by a person is an abuse of the process of law as it is a civil dispute.

NEW DELHI: The fact-finding committee constituted by the University Grants Commission (UGC) has held KIIT Deemed to be University, Bhubaneswar, responsible for the suicide of two students earlier this year, stating that ""illegal and unlawful activity by the university"" led to one of the deaths and that the administration's actions ""amount to criminal liability. ""Along with these findings, the committee has issued a set of strong recommendations, based on which the commission is contemplating a freeze on the university's expansion and departmental action against erring officials, among others. The UGC committee, chaired by Professor Nageshwar Rao, submitted its report on May 20, 2025, after campus visits, stakeholder interactions, and detailed analysis.The report cited the university's failure to act lawfully on sexual harassment complaints, inadequate hostel facilities, excessive student intake, and use of brute force on students as key failings contributing to the incidents.The committee's observations and findings include serious lapses in infrastructure and governance. It found that hostel facilities were ""substandard"" with ""three students put in a small room"" and female international students accommodated without cultural considerations. It also noted that complaints of sexual harassment were ignored or illegally compromised, that the administration forcibly removed Nepalese students without support, and that security personnel used physical aggression against students.The university, it said, prioritised its ""reputation of university over regulations, law of land and international relations of the country.""Observing that members of the internal complaints committee (ICC) and senior administrative personnel of the university ""are liable for criminal punishment as per law"", the report stated, ""... university's internal complaints committee (ICC) failed to take lawful action in reported sexual harassment cases. There was no transparency that protocols for investigation were followed. The girl had made complaints to the administration twice much before this tragic incident. In both the complaints, they decided to go for illegal compromise... The university has the power to punish the boy even when the first complaint was lodged. Instead of punishment, they favoured the boy by pushing forced illegal compromise with the girl. Later on, this has led to suicide. This suicide case could have been averted.""On Feb 16, Prakriti Lamsal, a third-year BTech student from Nepal, was found dead in her hostel room. The report also called for departmental action against ICC members who acted in violation of rules. ""Had KIIT University taken action to decide the reported harassment case as per law in the first case, the tragedy could have been avoided,"" the report stated.On May 2, another Nepalese undergraduate student was found dead in her hostel room at KIIT.","A fact-finding committee has held kiit deemed to be university, bhubaneswar responsible for the suicide of two students earlier this year.

It's appropriate given the circumstances. It should have been heard urgently.

The Supreme Court on Monday refused an urgent hearing for a petition requesting FIR registration against Justice Yashwant Varma over the cash-at-home row.Justice Yashwant Varma came under scrutiny earlier this year after a fire at his residence led to the discovery of a large sum of unaccounted cash. A Supreme Court inquiry committee subsequently found him guilty of misconduct, prompting then-Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna to recommend impeachment proceedings to Parliament. Justice Varma has since contested the findings and has approached the Supreme Court to challenge the panel’s conclusions.The bench comprising Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran was urged by lawyer Mathews Nedumpara that it was his third petition on the issue, and it be listed for hearing urgently, PTI reported.The lawyer insisted on FIR registration and investigation, stating it was inevitable. However, the bench expressed displeasure when the lawyer referred to the high court judge informally as 'Varma'.""Do you want it to be dismissed right now?"" the CJI asked, adding that it will be listed in due course.""It is impossible to be dismissed. An FIR has to be registered. Now Varma seems to be asking for that only. There has to be an FIR, an investigation,"" the lawyer said.""Is he your friend? He is still Justice Verma. How do you address him? Have some decorum. You are referring to a learned judge. He is still a judge of the court,"" the CJI said.""I don't think that greatness can apply to him. Matter has to be listed,"" the lawyer insisted.""Please don't dictate to the court,"" the CJI said.In recent developments, Justice Varma approached the Supreme Court to challenge an in-house inquiry panel's report that found him culpable in the cash discovery case.The judge seeks to nullify the May 8 recommendation by former Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna for parliamentary impeachment proceedings against him.The inquiry panel's report indicated that Justice Varma and his family maintained control over the store room where partially burnt cash was discovered, establishing misconduct serious enough to warrant removal proceedings.A three-judge committee, led by Punjab and Haryana High Court Chief Justice Sheel Nagu, conducted a 10-day investigation, examining 55 witnesses and inspecting the site of the accidental fire that occurred at 11.35 pm on March 14 at Justice Varma's official residence, who served in the Delhi high court before his transfer to Allahabad high court.Following the report's findings, former Chief Justice Khanna recommended the judge's impeachment to President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.","Justice yashwant varma came under scrutiny after a fire at his residence led to the discovery of a large sum of unaccounted cash.
