"Pankaj Dheer, TV’s Karna, loses fight with cancer",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pankaj-dheer-tvs-karna-loses-fight-with-cancer/articleshow/124592568.cms,"Actor Pankaj Dheer , whose impressive turn as the wronged prince Karna in the television epic, ‘Mahabharat’ (1988), embedded him in a generation’s memory, passed away in Mumbai on Wednesday. He was 68. Dheer was suffering from cancer. “He had been in and out of hospital in the past months,” producer and friend Ashoke Pandit told PTI.In an interview to the video magazine, ‘Lehren Retro’, the actor once revealed that he had refused the part of Arjun in the BR Chopra production because he was asked to shave off his moustache. “It was foolishness,” he admitted. Six months later he was offered Karna which didn’t require him to shave off facial hair.Dheer’s family roots went back to Kasur, a town south of Lahore, in pre-independence India. But the son of producer-director CL Dheer (‘Bahu Beti’, ‘Alingan’) had grown up in Bandra, Mumbai. The TV show’s Sanskritised dialogues triggered performance anxiety.The actor sought tips from Rahi Masoom Raza, who had co-written the show. Among other things, Raza suggested that he should read aloud the Hindi daily, ‘Navbharat Times’, a sister publication of The Times of India, everyday.With his imposing presence and empathetic voice, Dheer executed an unforgettable Karna drawing the audience's sympathy. The role gave him what every actor yearns for: fame, adulation and a steady career.When the character died in the serial, many shaved off their hair in Bastar, then part of Madhya Pradesh. “At the behest of (then) chief minister Arjun Singh, I flew there and consoled the mourners, assuring them that I was alive. It was something you believe only when you see it,” he recalled in the interview.Pankaj Dheer also said, “Many people do not know my name, but they recognize me as Karna. Even today, my face is published as Karna’s face in textbooks.”The role opened doors in television and films leading to nearly 100 TV shows and films. One of his most remembered roles was of King Shivdutt in the mega fantasy, ‘Chandrakanta’ (1994). Two notable films were Bobby Deol’s ‘Soldier’ (1998) and Shah Rukh Khan’s ‘Baadshah’ (1999), where he played a scheming security chief.Dheer’s passing was mourned on social media. Among those who attended the funeral were fellow actors from Mahabharat, and Salman Khan, with whom he had worked in films such as ‘Sanam Bewafa’ (1991).","Pankaj dheer, 68, passed away in mumbai on wednesday.

‘Most affected’ left-wing-hit districts down to just 3 from 7 in 6 months: MHA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/most-affected-left-wing-hit-districts-down-to-just-3-from-7-in-6-mths-mha/articleshow/124592169.cms,".

Andhra, Telangana latest states to be out of Naxal-affected list, says

MHA

New Delhi: Months ahead of the March 31, 2026 deadline to fully eliminate armed Naxalism from the country, the Centre declared that the total number of Left-wing extremism-hit districts have fallen to just 11 from 18 in March 2025 and 126 in 2013, with the “most-affected districts” also down to three from six in the last seven months.Hailing the “historic milestone in eliminating Naxalism” in a post on X, home minister Amit Shah said, “Under Modi ji's vision for a terror-free India, tireless counter-insurgency operations and people-centric development are shrinking the space of the left-wing extremists, leaving no place for them to hide. By March 31, 2026, India will be free from the menace of Naxalism”.The home ministry in a separate statement said only Bijapur, Sukma and Narayanpur districts in Chhattisgarh are now most-affected by left wing extremism (LWE).Kanker district in Chhattisgarh, West Singhbhum in Jharkhand, and Gadchiroli in Maharashtra have been shifted from the list of districts “most affected” by Left-wing extremism to “affected” category after latest review by the home ministry.The five remaining districts in “Naxal-affected” list are Gariyaband, Dantewada, and Mohalla-Manpur-Ambagarh Chowki in Chhattisgarh; Balaghat in MP; and Kandhamal in Odisha.Seven districts — Alluri Sitarama Raju in Andhra Pradesh, Kalahandi and Malkangiri in Odisha, Bhadradri-Kothagudem and Mulugu in Telangana, Latehar in Jharkhand, and Nuapada in Odisha — have been removed from the MHA list.Andhra and Telangana are now out of the LWE-affected states. Earlier, in March 2025, Kerala (Wayanad & Kannur) and West Bengal (Jhargram) were also delisted.Operational successes in 2025 have been record-breaking, with 312 LWE cadres killed — including the CPI (Maoist) general secretary and eight other politburo or central committee members. Another 836 cadres were arrested and 1,639 surrendered.Modi govt’s National Action Plan against LWE — focused on intelligence-based ops, targeting leadership, development of infra, choking finances, and Centre-state coordination — has delivered major setbacks to the movement once dubbed India’s “biggest internal security challenge.”",The total number of left-wing extremism-hit districts have fallen to just 11 from 18 in march 2025 and 126 in 2013. The “most-affected districts” also down to three from six in the last seven months. Andhra and telangana are now out of the lwe-affected states.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124592191,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-67106,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

New Delhi: Calling it a “bogus challenge” to the will of late businessman Sunjay Kapur, his wife Priya on Wednesday told Delhi high court that incorrect spellings or addresses can’t be grounds to invalidate the document.Rebutting the allegations levelled by Kapur’s ex-wife Karisma Kapoor ’s children that the will was forged, Priya’s counsel Rajiv Nayyar told the court that no one had disputed or denied Sunjay’s signatures or those of the other two witnesses.The only ground to challenge the will, he told Justice Jyoti Singh, was if the deceased was not of sound mind, was under coercion, or was under some inability to execute the will. He told HC there was “nothing unusual in the bequest” since “in wife vs wife he would obviously name the present wife as beneficiary over an estranged wife”. The plea of the plaintiffs, Samaira and Kiaan Raj, was bereft of any cause of action, he argued.“Now I am told there are four additional grounds to invalidate a will — wrong spelling, wrong address, writing testatrix instead of testator, and closeness of witnesses,” Nayyar said.“There were two opportunities for the plaintiff. There was a will reading. It was read out to everyone, including the plaintiff... The suit was filed on Sept 9. There is no reference or challenge to the will in the plaint. The will was shared with them on Sept 15. They were conscious of the existence of the will as far back as July 30, prior to the filing of the suit. Today we are dealing with a non-existent challenge to the will” he said.","Kapur’s ex-wife karisma kapoor ’s children alleged that the will was forged.

Poll Do you support the new policy requiring developers to deposit three years' rent upfront before starting redevelopment projects? Yes, it's a great idea to protect residents No, it may discourage developers





THANE: In order to prevent redevelopment projects from stalling midway and protect residents from displacement without compensation, the state housing department is framing a new policy mandating developers to deposit three years' rent before taking up any redevelopment work, deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde said on Saturday.""Some builders take on redevelopment projects, vacate residents from flats, fail to pay rent or delay construction, sometimes even trading rights with other developers, which leads to stalled projects and inconvenience for residents,"" Shinde said. ""To address this, we are introducing a policy where builders must deposit three years' rent upfront while their project execution capability will also be simultaneously assessed before approval,"" he said during a lottery function for over 5,000 Mhada flats from the Konkan region in Thane.Shinde said the state was committed to reviving stalled redevelopment projects. ""We are aligning with cash-rich govt agencies that have a reputation for completing projects on time and through combined investment with private developers, are expecting to raise Rs 50 lakh crore over the next five years and construct 35 lakh homes in the state,"" he added.Shinde, who also heads the housing department, said after he took over, Mhada started working on a pioneering housing policy for senior citizens, possibly making it the first state in the country to prioritise this segment. In addition, there are plans to develop supply in the affordable housing segment, so that sections such as working women and mill workers benefit and rental homes are available for migrant workers as open-market rates are often unaffordable.","Maharashtra's housing department is introducing a new policy requiring developers to deposit three years' rent upfront for redevelopment projects.

"EPFO final settlement period extended: PF withdrawal now after 12 months, pension after 36 months; what it means for members",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/epfo-final-settlement-period-extended-pf-withdrawal-now-after-12-months-pension-after-36-months-what-it-means-for-members/articleshow/124554802.cms,"



The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members. Under the revised rules, members can now withdraw their provident fund after 12 months of unemployment and their pension after 36 months, PTI reported.The change was approved by the apex decision-making body of the EPFO, the Central Board of Trustees, chaired by Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, during a meeting held on Monday. Earlier, the scheme allowed full withdrawals from both accounts after just two months of continuous unemployment.A senior official explained PTI that the move aims to ensure social security for formal sector workers who typically exit the EPFO after two months of unemployment. “Most of these unemployed youth need to enrol again when they secure new jobs and lose chances of earning pension and other benefits, as an account becomes pensionable only after a combined service of 10 years or more,” the official said.The ministry said the revision will also allow partial withdrawals, enabling members to meet immediate financial needs without affecting their retirement savings or pension entitlements.Additionally, a provision has been introduced to maintain a minimum balance of 25 per cent of contributions in members’ accounts at all times.“This will enable members to enjoy the high interest rate currently offered by the EPFO, 8.25 per cent per annum, along with compounding benefits to build a sizeable retirement corpus,” the statement added.The rationalisation is intended to improve ease of access while ensuring members maintain a sufficient retirement fund over the long term.","Epfo has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members.

"Bihar elections: BJP-JD(U)-RJD unite - the reason, Prashant Kishor",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-elections-bjp-jdu-rju-unite-the-reason-prashant-kishor/articleshow/124584403.cms,"‘Mungerilal ke haseen sapne’

Embarrassment for his workers: JD(U)

'His tyre has already been flattened': RJD



Kishor bows out — 'in larger interest'



NEW DELHI: In Bihar’s charged political arena, the adage “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” seemed to come alive on Wednesday, as rivals —BJP-JD(U) and RJD —found common ground in Prashant Kishor . The trio united in criticism of Jan Suraaj Party founder while mocking him for deciding to eventually not contest the upcoming assembly elections.Union minister Giriraj Singh was even more scathing, calling Kishor’s expectations of winning over 150 seats “Mungerilal ke haseen sapne” — a reference to a popular television show about daydreams. “Kishor realised he would not win. His party is nothing but a ‘vote katwa’ outfit — the ‘B team’ of the RJD,” Singh said.Echoing that sentiment, BJP spokesperson Niraj Kumar said, “Kishor’s bubble burst even before the elections. By announcing that he won’t contest, he has admitted defeat for himself and his party.” JD(U)’s Neeraj Kumar called the move “a humiliation for his workers,” accusing Kishor of having “run away before the electoral battle.”BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said Kishor’s withdrawal was “a business decision,” adding, “Prashant Kishor is a very smart businessman and has a lot of experience in election campaigns. Perhaps he realised that the ground situation is not in his favour and that if he loses, his enterprise will lose credibility.”JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar called Kishor’s withdrawal a “humiliation” for his own party workers, accusing him of abandoning ship before the real fight began. “He has run away before the electoral battle,” Kumar said.“Earlier, he claimed to have undertaken padayatras to understand the people's issues. What happened to that? His decision is sheer embarrassment for his workers,” he added.RJD’s Mrityunjay Tiwary also mocked Kishor saying he had “accepted defeat before the battle began.” “Kishor has realised that he and his party will face a humiliating defeat in the upcoming assembly polls,” Tiwary remarked.“Kishor must understand that politics is not as easy as offering consultancy to others. His tyre has already been flattened.”Prashant Kishor, once among India’s most sought-after election strategists, announced that he would stay away from contesting this year’s Bihar polls — a decision he said was taken “in the larger interest” of his Jan Suraaj Party. In an interview with PTI, Kishor said a tally of “less than 150 seats” would be considered a defeat for his party, but insisted that “if Jan Suraaj wins, it will change national politics.”He explained that his decision was meant to keep the focus on party-building rather than personal ambition. “If I were to contest, it would have distracted me from the necessary organisational work,” said Kishor, who was earlier expected to contest from Raghopur, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav’s constituency.","Bjp-jd(u) and rjd united in criticism of jan suraaj party founder prashant kishor.

"‘Nothing is well in NDA’: BJP bets big on Chirag, again; Bihar allies in a tizzy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nothing-is-well-in-nda-bjp-bets-big-on-chirag-again-bihar-allies-in-a-tizzy/articleshow/124580036.cms,"NEW DELHI: ‘This time, nothing is well in NDA … ’ Rashtriya Lok Morcha chief and former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha , who has been a key partner of the ruling Bihar alliance, has sent out clear signals of discontent within the NDA. The RLP leader, reports say quoting sources, is unhappy over Mahua assembly seat in Vaishali district being given to Chirag Paswan.Kushwaha is not alone in raising the banner of revolt. Another key NDA partner, Union minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) leader Jitan Ram Manjhi has also made it clear that he will field his party (HAM) candidates from at least two seats - Bodh Gaya and Makhdumpur assembly constituencies.Both the allies, who have got 6 seats each under the division, are upset over the relatively larger number of seats – 29 – allotted to Paswan’s LJP(Ram Vilas). This despite the fact that Chirag Paswan’s performance in the last assembly elections was anything but inspiring. In 2020, the party had walked out of the NDA and contested on all 243 seats, but could win only one seat. However, what it did manage to do was damage Nitish Kumar ’s JD(U) and make it a junior partner of the BJP in Bihar assembly.Chirag was perhaps rewarded by the BJP for this role when he was taken back into the NDA fold ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections and given five parliamentary seats – all of which the party won. That 100% strike rate perhaps could be the justification for giving the fledgling party 29 seats- way more than the other two allies.Political experts say Chirag Paswan remains part of BJP’s gameplan post elections once again. In 2020, he helped BJP by staying out of NDA. This time around, he could play a key role in ensuring that Nitish Kumar does not become the chief minister if NDA wins the elections.“The actual seat division in NDA is 130 for BJP and 113 for Nitish Kumar,” says political analyst Kumar Vijay. “The BJP has given 29 seats to Chirag Pawan so that in post-election scenario the numbers won by LJP can be used to sideline Nitish Kumar’s claims to the top post if NDA wins the elections,” he says.“Instead of giving so many seats to Chirag, the BJP should have tried to make all the allies, including Nitish Kumar, happy ahead of the elections. Post elections, after winning the required seats, it could have asserted and staked claim to the top post,” Kumar says. “In Bihar BJP, non-political persons are taking political decisions. Small people have been given big responsibilities and hence they have mismanaged everything,” the political analyst adds.The BJP has already initiated fire-fighting process. Upendra Kushwaha was summoned to Delhi to meet Amit Shah. ""We met with the Home Minister, and the issue was discussed. After this discussion, we now hope that there will be no difficulties ahead, and the NDA government will definitely be formed in Bihar. In every way, all the alliance parties within the NDA are ready,"" Kushwaha told reporters.But the bigger worry for the BJP would be Nitish Kumar. Reports say Nitish Kumar is unhappy with the way things have turned out. Already several senior JD(U) leaders have raised a banner of revolt. From open resignation letters to dharna, Nitish is under pressure from within to salvage the situation for his party. There are two camps within the JD(U) – one that favours close association with the BJP and the other that is opposing party’s alleged subjugation. It will be interesting to see how things pan out in the next few days, especially how the Bihar chief minister reacts to BJP’s “Chirag plan.”",Upendra kushwaha is unhappy over mahua assembly seat being given to chirag paswan.

NEW DELHI: With just two days left for filing nominations for the first phase of the Bihar assembly elections , political activity has picked up pace across the state.

If I have said anything wrong, I ask her to forgive me. I will render countless obeisance at her feet. But I ask her to help my daughter get justice,"" the victim’s father told TV channels, according to PTI.""I have been demanding a CBI probe into this case. I think that would be good. But that depends on the state administration as well,"" he added.His remarks come days after he criticised the chief minister for her comment that ""women should not venture out at night,"" following the assault of his daughter, a second-year MBBS student at a private medical college in Durgapur.Earlier on Monday, the survivor's father stated that, ""She (Mamata Banerjee) is also a woman. How can she say such an irresponsible thing? Should women quit their jobs and sit at home? It seems Bengal is under the rule of Aurangzeb.""He further expressed a loss of faith in West Bengal's law and order situation and said he wanted to take his daughter back to Odisha for her safety. ""I want to take my daughter back to Odisha. Her life comes first, her career later,"" he added.The controversy began after Mamata Banerjee, while addressing the media about the crime, said, ""I learned that she was outside the campus at 12.30 am. Students residing in hostels should refrain from venturing out at night. Private medical colleges must ensure the safety of their students, particularly female students, who should not be permitted to leave the premises at night. Girls should protect themselves as well. ""Defending the police, Banerjee had said it was not possible for officers to monitor everyone's movements or stand guard outside every house.Her comments, however, drew sharp criticism from opposition leaders, women’s rights groups, and the Odisha government, who accused her of victim-blaming.Mamata later clarified that her statement had been ""distorted and taken out of context."" ""The media distorted my words. You ask me a question, I answer it, and then you distort it. Do not try this kind of politics,"" she asserted.The 22-year-old MBBS student was allegedly gang-raped on October 10 after she stepped out of her college campus with a male friend to get food.Police have so far arrested six people, including the friend, in connection with the case, which has triggered widespread outrage and political uproar across the state.","Father of durgapur gang rape victim seeks forgiveness from west bengal chief minister.

CHANDIGARH: In yet another dramatic twist in IPS officer Y Puran Kumar’s alleged suicide, Rohtak police on Wednesday registered an FIR under abetment of suicide and criminal conspiracy charges, naming all those mentioned in the final video of ASI Sandeep Kumar Lather, who allegedly shot himself dead on Tuesday after accusing Puran Kumar of corruption.The FIR (number 305) was registered at Sadar police station in Rohtak a few hours after Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini visited Sandeep’s family in Rohtak’s Ladhot village on Wednesday morning and promised justice. The FIR had not been made public at the time of going to print, but according to highly placed officials, four persons are named in it — the deceased Puran Kumar’s wife Amneet P Kumar, an IAS officer of the 2001 batch, her brother and Punjab AAP MLA Amit Rattan, and head constable Sushil Kumar, who was Puran Kumar’s PSO and is now in jail remand in a corruption case.According to multiple sources, the FIR was registered under BNS Secs 108 (abetment of suicide) and 61 (criminal conspiracy) on a complaint from Sandeep’s wife Santosh.Officials said Virendra Badkhalsa, OSD to the Haryana CM, informed Sandeep’s family about the registration of the FIR on Wednesday evening. Only then did Sandeep’s family agree to an autopsy. Around the same time, Puran Kumar’s body was being cremated in Chandigarh, 230km away, after an eight-day impasse.Sandeep’s body, which the family had kept in a hired freezer, was taken to PGI-MS Rohtak at night. Sandeep was part of the team investigating the case involving Puran Kumar and was also involved in the arrest of Puran Kumar’s former PSO on Oct 5. It was this FIR, registered on Oct 6, that is claimed to be the trigger for Puran Kumar’s suicide as Sushil was alleged to have given a statement that he was demanding money on behalf of Puran Kumar, who was then Rohtak IG. The Haryana govt found itself battling on two fronts. Amneet and other members of the family had refused to allow an autopsy until action was taken against DGP Shatrujeet Kapur and then Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya, who were among those named by Puran Kumar in his suicide note.",Asi sandeep kumar lather allegedly shot himself dead on tuesday after accusing y puran kumar of corruption.

NEW DELHI: Balancing the concerns for environment, sentiments of citizens during the festive season and right to livelihood of workers in the firecracker industry, Supreme Court on Wednesday temporarily relaxed its complete ban and allowed bursting of only green crackers on two Diwali days, both in the morning and evening.Permitting the sale of NEERI-approved green firecrackers through designated outlets from Oct 19 to Oct 20, a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran ordered district administrations and police to “ensure that use of firecrackers shall be confined between 6-7am and 8-10pm on the two days i.e. the one before and on Diwali day”.However, SC banned sale of crackers through e-commerce websites and transportation of any kind of crackers from outside into the National Capital Region (NCR). It continued the ban on joined firecrackers (laris). The court asked Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and state PCBs to monitor air quality index (AQI) daily from Oct 14 to 25, and file a report in SC.Pronouncing the 21-page order five days ahead of Diwali, CJI Gavai said the permission to burst only green crackers, as allowed by SC in its Oct 23, 2018, judgment, was turned into a ban on all forms of crackers in Delhi and NCR on Dec 19 last year based on a complete ban on crackers issued by the Delhi govt on Oct 14 last year.The bench said the SC ban on crackers has been observed more in breach during festive days as conventional firecrackers were smuggled in and burst, causing more harm to the environment. “In such a case, we must take a balanced approach, taking into account the conflicting interests and permit in moderation, while not compromising the environmental concerns arising,” it said.","Supreme court allows bursting of only green crackers on two diwali days.

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Nitish Kumar ’s Janata Dal (United) on Wednesday released its first list of 57 candidates ahead of the Bihar assembly elections.JD(U), which is looking to retain power in the state, has fielded 30 new faces, while 27 sitting MLAs have been renominated.The announcement comes as National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partners continue to send mixed signals over seat allocations, just days after the seat-sharing deal was finalised. Under the arrangement, JD(U) and BJP will contest 101 seats each, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) 29 seats, and Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) and Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM) six seats each.The upcoming election appears to be a sequel to the previous assembly polls, when chief minister Nitish Kumar and Chirag Paswan clashed after the latter broke away from the NDA to contest independently. In 2020, though Chirag’s party won just one seat out of 135 contested, it inflicted heavy damage on JD(U), defeating its candidates in over two dozen constituencies and reducing Nitish’s party to 43 seats — its lowest tally ever.This time, JD(U) has fielded candidates in five constituencies reportedly eyed by Chirag’s Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas).JD(U) named Komal Singh (Gaighat), Ratnesh Sada (Sonbarsa), Vidyasagar Singh Nishad (Morwa), Rajkumar Singh (Matihani) and Kaushal Kishore (Rajgir).Notably, two of these five seats are reserved for Scheduled Castes - a key voter base for LJP (RV).As in every Bihar election, caste has been a decisive factor in candidate selection and JD(U)'s list seems to try and balance the equation. Banking on its social justice plank, the party has given tickets to 23 OBC candidates that include nine Kushwahas, 10 Kurmis, three Yadavs, and one Baniya. It has also fielded 12 Scheduled Caste candidates.In addition, nine Extremely Backward Caste (EBC) nominees - JD(U)’s largest support base - are in the fray.Among upper castes, 13 candidates have been fielded - six Bhumihars, five Rajputs, and two Brahmins.JD(U) has not fielded a single Muslim candidate in its first list, a notable omission given the party’s traditional appeal among Muslim voters within the NDA.In the 2020 assembly elections, JD(U) fielded 11 Muslim candidates out of 115 seats, none of whom won. The figure, around 10%, was already lower than the community's share of Bihar's population (over 15%).JD(U) has fielded five of the cabinet ministers from CM Nitish Kumar's cabinet. Those who have made the cut are: Shravan Kumar (Nalanda), Vijay Kumar Chaudhary (Sarairanjan), Maheshwar Hazari (Kalyanpur), Madan Sahni (Bahadurpur) and Ratnesh Sada (Sonbarsa).The party has also fielded four women candidates: Komal Singh (Gaighat), Ashwamedh Devi (Samastipur), Ravina Kushwaha (Vibhutipur) and Kavita Kumari Saha (Madhepura).Turncoats, too, have found space. Shyam Rajak, who rejoined JD(U) after quitting RJD last year, and strongman Anant Kumar Singh, who has filed his nomination from Mokama, are among those fielded.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar Assembly elections. The 243 assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the counting of votes scheduled to take place on November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, while there were 7.89 crore electors as of June 24 this year. An Election Commission press release stated that 65 lakh voters were removed from the draft list, and the number of electors in the draft list as of August 1, 2025, stood at 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly election, the BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share. The Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with a 15.7% vote share. The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) contested seven seats, winning four, and achieved 0.9% of the vote share.","Jd(u) has fielded 30 new faces, while 27 sitting mlas have been renominated.

NEW DELHI: The race for Bihar’s 2025 Assembly elections intensified on Wednesday with a flurry of major developments across parties — from BJP’s new list of candidates to Prashant Kishor ’s decision to stay out of the contest and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav ’s filing of nomination papers from his family bastion of Raghopur.While the NDA allies have almost completed their ticket distribution, the opposition INDIA bloc remains entangled in talks over seat-sharing. With the first phase of polling just weeks away, the political heat in Bihar is soaring, here are the major developments of the day:Prashant Kishor confirmed he will not contest the upcoming assembly elections, saying his decision was made for the “greater good” of his party, Jan Suraaj.Speaking to PTI, Kishor said, “If I were to contest, it would distract me from necessary organisational work.” He added that his party had decided to field Chanchal Singh against Tejashwi Yadav in Raghopur instead.Despite stepping aside, Kishor exuded confidence about Jan Suraaj’s performance: “We will either win handsomely or face a complete drubbing. There’s no middle ground.” He further stated, “A tally below 150 will be a defeat for me.”RJD claimed Kishor has “accepted defeat for his Jan Suraaj Party even before going to the battlefield,” while the BJP said, “Kishor realised he would not win elections.” The JD(U) called it a “humiliation for his party workers.”Reacting, RJD’s Mrityunjay Tiwary said, “Kishor’s tyre has been flattened,” while BJP’s Niraj Kumar said his “bubble burst even before the elections.” JD(U)’s Neeraj Kumar added, “He has run away before the electoral battle.”Union minister Giriraj Singh mocked Kishor’s target as “Mungerilal ke haseen sapne,” calling Jan Suraaj a “vote katwa” and “RJD’s B team.”Janata Dal (United) released its first list, betting big on newcomers. Chief minister Nitish Kumar’s party announced its first list of 57 candidates, featuring 30 fresh faces alongside 27 sitting MLAs.The newcomer-heavy list targets key constituencies, including five seats reportedly sought by Chirag Paswan’s LJP (RV), signaling a direct challenge. JD(U) has also carefully balanced caste representation—fielding candidates across OBCs, Scheduled Castes, Extremely Backward Castes, and upper castes—to maintain its traditional social justice appeal.Notably absent in this list are Muslim candidates, a departure from past elections, which might impact JD(U)’s support among Muslim voters. The party has also included cabinet ministers, women candidates, and recent turncoats, showcasing a mix of experience and fresh energy.The Congress announced 17 candidates for the elections, even as it continued to remain silent on any formal seat-sharing arrangement with the Mahagathbandhan. The candidates were handed party tickets by Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president Rajesh Ram.The list includes Vijendra Chaudhary from Muzaffarpur, Om Prakash Garg from Gopalganj, Jitendra Singh from Amarpur, and Amita Bhushan from Begusarai. Also nominated are Lalan Kumar (Sultanganj), Rajesh Ram (Kutumba), Shashi Shekhar (Wazirganj), and Kaushalendra Kumar (Nalanda). Anand Shankar Singh will contest from Aurangabad, while Pratima Das has been fielded from Rajapakad. Shiv Prakash Garib Das will contest from Bachhwara, and Trishuldhari Singh from Barabigha.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) released its second and third list for the upcoming polls. With this the saffron party announced all the 101 candidates it had been allotted as part of the NDA.In its third list of 18 candidates, the party named Bina Devi from Kochadhaman and Sanjay Pandey from Narkatiaganj.In the second list of 12 candidates, it was announced that popular folk singer Maithili Thakur will contest from Alinagar in Darbhanga, while former IPS officer Anand Mishra, who earlier headed the youth wing of Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj party, has been fielded from Buxar.The list also includes Ram Chandra Prasad from Hayaghat, Ranjan Kumar from Muzaffarpur, Subhash Singh from Gopalganj, and Vinay Kumar Singh from Sonepur. BJP had released its first list a day earlier, featuring key figures such as deputy chief ministers Samrat Choudhary (Tarapur) and Vijay Sinha (Lakhisarai), along with former Deputy CMs Renu Devi (Bettiah) and Tarkishore Prasad (Katihar).Interestingly, Assembly Speaker Nand Kishore Yadav was denied a ticket from Patna Sahib, replaced by Ratnesh Kushwaha, while long-time MLA Arun Kumar Sinha was dropped in favour of Sanjay Gupta from Kumrahar. The list also includes nine women candidates, including Renu Devi and Sweety Singh from Kishanganj.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav filed his nomination papers from Raghopur, the family’s traditional seat, in the presence of his parents — RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav and former CM Rabri Devi. He was accompanied by sister Misa Bharti and senior party aides.Addressing supporters, Tejashwi dismissed rumours of contesting multiple seats, saying, “The voters of Raghopur have reposed their trust in me twice. I am contesting only this one seat. But I want the people of Bihar to think they’re voting for Tejashwi in all 243 constituencies.”He pledged to transform Bihar’s governance, saying the polls were about “not just changing the government but changing Bihar.” The RJD, as part of the INDIA bloc, has promised to bring a Job Guarantee Act ensuring one government job per household if elected.Thousands of supporters lined the 40-km route from Patna to Hajipur as the RJD convoy moved towards the collectorate, showering the Yadav family’s car with flower petals. Lalu Prasad, in a wheelchair, accompanied his son into the nomination venue.","Kishor opts out: ‘will not contest, need to build jan suraaj’jd(u) releases first list — big bet on new comers.

Delhi has only one CSIR-NEERI registered manufacturer of green crackers while there are 140 certified dealers, he pointed out.“We held a meeting with 140 certified dealers to sell only NEERI-approved green crackers bearing QR codes. If more dealers apply for licences, we may give temporary licences to additional vendors,” said Sirsa, who chaired meetings with dealers and enforcement agencies, including PESO, NEERI, MCD, NDMC, and Delhi Police.Delhi Police has been directed to process temporary sale licence applications within two days, ensuring timely readiness. After Diwali, retailers will get two days to return or safely dispose of unsold stock, ensuring that restrictions are reinstated immediately.Asked about the city markets being flooded with all kinds of firecrackers, Sirsa said the enforcement teams will act against those selling illegally. “Since crackers were banned till now, people were sneaking them in. As green crackers have been allowed now, we will have an organised system,” he said.The Delhi govt will continue monitoring AQI levels from Oct 14 to 25 through DPCC and submit daily reports to CPCB and the Supreme Court in line with the court’s directives.“This Diwali, retailers are also our partners in spreading awareness. They must inform buyers that only green crackers are allowed and explain why the Hon’ble Supreme Court has wisely restricted their use to two hours in the evening and one hour in the morning for two days.
