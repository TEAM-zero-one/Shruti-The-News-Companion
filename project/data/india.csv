NEW DELHI: Flight operations at Srinagar were temporarily suspended on Friday due to snowfall, with both arrivals and departures put on hold.In an advisory to passengers, the airline said the suspension could lead to extended wait times, both onboard aircraft and at the airport, as weather conditions continued to affect operations. It added that boarding formalities may be completed in advance so that flights can depart immediately once clearance is granted.The airline said it was closely monitoring the situation and assured passengers that efforts were being made to minimise inconvenience. Travellers have been advised to check the latest status of their flights before heading to the airport, as operations will resume only after weather conditions improve.Cold conditions tightened their grip across Kashmir on Thursday as minimum temperatures dipped further at most locations, with officials warning that an approaching western disturbance could bring fresh snowfall later in the day.Night temperatures fell below the freezing point across the valley. In Srinagar, the minimum temperature dropped by one degree from the previous night to settle at minus 3.4 degrees Celsius on Wednesday night.The coldest spot in the valley was Sonamarg in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district, where the mercury plunged to minus 6.1 degrees Celsius, compared to minus 5.5 degrees Celsius a night earlier. North Kashmir’s ski resort of Gulmarg recorded a minimum of minus 4 degrees Celsius.In south Kashmir, Pahalgam, which also serves as a base camp for the annual Amarnath Yatra, registered a low of minus 4.4 degrees Celsius, down from minus 3.8 degrees Celsius the previous night.Officials said Qazigund recorded a minimum of minus 3.8 degrees Celsius, while Kokernag settled at minus 2.6 degrees Celsius and Kupwara at minus 3.7 degrees Celsius.According to the meteorological department, two strong western disturbances are expected to affect Jammu and Kashmir this week. The first system is likely to impact the region on Thursday, followed by another on January 26. Under their influence, widespread light to moderate rainfall and snowfall, including in the plains of the Kashmir Valley, is forecast, with peak activity expected on January 23 and January 27.","Flight operations at srinagar were temporarily suspended on friday due to snowfall.

77th Republic Day Parade to Witness Debut of DRDO’s Hypersonic Anti-Ship Missile

.

NEW DELHI: At the Rashtriya Rangshala Camp in Delhi Cantonment, the days leading up to Jan 26 are marked by constant activity. The smell of fresh paint hangs heavy in the air as the sound of construction echo across the parade ground. Artisans climb makeshift stairways, painters add final touches and workers carefully align massive structures.Amid this controlled bustle, Republic Day tableaux are taking shape, with every frame, colour and detail preparing to tell captivating stories on Kartavya Path.This year's Jan 26 parade marks 150 years of Vande Mataram, and its spirit runs through every creation. On Thursday, TOI witnessed around 30 tableaux in different stages of completion, each reflecting India's past, present and its aspirations. Nearly 10,000 people will soon watch them roll along Kartavya Path, while 2,500 artistes are set to perform, capping the visual spectacle on wheels.One of the most striking displays is a tableau titled 'Operation Sindoor: Victory Through Jointness', which highlights India's military strength, with Rafale jets and Akash missiles on display. Nearby, Gujarat's tableau traces the journey of India from 1906 to 1947 under the theme of 'Vande Mataram', its structure anchored by a towering figure of Mahatma Gandhi.Delhi's tableau pays tribute to the Prime Ministers' Museum while showcasing the capital's transformed skyline, featuring the new Parliament, Bharat Mandapam, Signature Bridge and Yashobhoomi as symbols of a changing nation.Other states, too, have brought their landscapes and legacies vividly to life. Bihar's tableau follows the journey of makhana - from pond to plate. ""It took one month to make this whole thing,"" a carpenter said. Himachal Pradesh is honouring its 1,203 gallantry award winners and Punjab is reflecting the spiritual courage of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur through their tableaux.Ladakh showcases the engineering feat of Shyok Tunnel, Uttarakhand displays its traditional instruments and utensils, while J&K recreates the charm of a houseboat. Dancers from Tamil Nadu will perform mayilattam, also known as peacock dance. ""A team of 17 members is here from Chennai to perform,"" said Jyotsana, adjusting her costume with a smile. Parasmal Solanki from Rajasthan will perform along with his 16-member team.Nagaland's tableau features a massive hornbill. ""We want everyone to know about Hornbill Festival,"" said Yangerla, a folk dancer. Jharkhand's tableau showcases the state's natural beauty and aims at attracting tourists, said Neha Agarwal, a state representative.Karnataka's tableau, From Millets to Microchips, tells a story of holistic growth through scenes of a farmer family with millets, silicon crystals, a robot and a giant microchip - linking agriculture with technology and innovation. Assam has transformed terracotta into visual poetry. Chhattisgarh's tableau pays homage to tribal heroes like Veer Gunda Dhur and Veer Narayan Singh.Union ministries have added their own narratives. The education tableau traces the evolution of India's knowledge from Aryabhatta's shunya (zero) to PM Shri schools. ""All my team members and I are from different Kendriya Vidyalayas,"" said Elix Singh, a Class XI student.A unique tableau designed by filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali for the ministry of information and broadcasting depicts the evolution of storytelling - from its oral tradition to cinema. The panchayati raj tableau in the vicinity highlights the SVAMITA scheme.On Republic Day, these individual pieces will come together to form a moving portrait of India, diverse in expression and united in purpose.","Nearly 10,000 people will soon watch them roll along kartavya path. 2,500 artistes are set to perform, capping the visual spectacle on wheels.

Triple talaq-halala FIR puts focus on legal grey area,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/triple-talaq-halala-fir-puts-focus-on-legal-grey-area/articleshow/127206877.cms,".

NEW DELHI: When police in UP registered an FIR on Dec 9, 2025, it was not just another complaint under the 2019 Triple Talaq law. The allegations were shocking and went further, into a grey zone the law has never squarely addressed: What happens to women after talaq is pronounced.According to the FIR filed in Amroha’s Said Nagli, the woman, after being divorced through instant triple talaq, was pressured by her husband, her brother-in-law and clerics to undergo “ halala ” multiple times so she could be returned to the marriage. An exception that permits a divorced Muslim couple to remarry, the practice of halala often involves planned, short-term marriages — even arranged one-time encounters — to facilitate consummation of the woman with another man, enabling the former couple to reunite.The woman’s complaint detailed the ordeal. She said she was “gang-raped under false pretenses of halala carried out under threats, intimidation and coercion”.Police have invoked the law banning instant triple talaq — sections 3 and 4 of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019. Multiple provisions and relevant sections of BNS that deal with rape, aggravated hurt, criminal intimidation and criminal conspiracy, have also been added.In the initial FIR, there are three accused: Her husband, his cousin and a hakim (traditional healer.) Since then, police have added more accused to the list.Amroha police told TOI that one accused — her husband — had been arrested so far. “The FIR has been registered on the basis of a written complaint. Further action will depend on corroboration and evidence,” SHO Vikas Sahrawat said. Amroha police are on the lookout for others on the run, he added.This week, based on Zubaida’s (name changed) age at the time of her marriage, police added multiple provisions of the Pocso Act to the FIR, expanding its scope. (The move, incidentally, also brings into focus an unresolved legal grey area, as Muslim personal law is not codified and does not prescribe a minimum age, instead linking marriageability to puberty. The issue remains unsettled by the Supreme Court so far, with courts in different states taking conflicting positions. )The FIR covers several years of alleged abuse, assault and rape. Zubeida told police she was forcefully married off in 2015 at the age of 15, and subjected to pronouncements of instant triple talaq twice — once in 2016, and again in 2021, followed by three coerced reconciliation attempts through halala.“I felt like I was being handed over every time. I was too ashamed to come out with what had happened to me. I didn’t want my daughter to grow up reading about it,” Zubaida told TOI. A former student of one of Aligarh’s top schools, Zubaida comes from a family with a history in public service — her grandfather was DSP in UP police and her father a lawyer.After the first triple talaq in 2016, she said she was told she could return to her husband only after undergoing halala, a process that, according to her complaint, involved sexual assault by someone introduced as an “intermediary”.In Feb 2025, she said she was told she would need to follow the halala process twice as her marriage had broken down twice by then. Zubaida’s complaint said after years of being a single mother and financial difficulties, she had once again fallen for the accused’s false promise of remarriage. “It was after a long time that I realised what had happened to me was wrong,” Zubaida said.With her husband now behind bars, Zubaida said she was struggling to keep life going for her daughter.Her husband, meanwhile, has alleged that he was harassed and threatened by Zubaida and her relatives. In his written complaint, dated Nov 26, 2025, he claimed that Zubaida “tried to forcibly enter his house and threatened him with false criminal cases”.Earlier in 2021, according to documents, Zubaida’s divorce was finalised through a family court’s decree, with the court placing the daughter’s custody with the father at the time.Halala finds no mention in Indian statutory law. The 2019 Muslim Women Act criminalised instant triple talaq, making its pronouncement a punishable offence, but it did not — and does not — recognise halala.According to activists, halala cases rarely leave a paper trail. Fear of stigma, economic dependence and concerns about children often keep victims silent.“In many cases, women don’t even know that what is being done to them is wrong,” said Zakia Soman, Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan founder. “Halala is not mentioned in the Quran. It survives through misinterpretation, patriarchal control and silence. There is a hush-hush around it. For a woman to come forward takes extraordinary courage.”Soman added that the practice survived in pockets, operating through informal and largely invisible set-ups. “Triple talaq was criminalised on paper, but the ecosystem that sustained it was never dismantled. Without regulations, halala survives as an unpoliced, underground arrangement,” she said.Soman cited cases where clerics themselves offered to “perform” halala, and others where women were passed between men to settle personal disputes, family feuds or even debts — arrangements that remain largely hidden unless a woman breaks ranks and approaches the police. Soman said practices such as halala, child marriage and puberty-as-marriage-age thrive in a legal grey zone.Experts point to structural gaps that make such cases hard to prosecute. One is the absence of mandatory registration of Muslim marriages and divorces. “Nikahs are largely undocumented,” said Naish Hasan, a Lucknow-based activist who has worked with halala survivors for over two decades. “When there is no paper trail, the burden of proof falls entirely on women.”She said the practice remained alive, particularly among poor and marginalised women. “For years, cases kept surfacing before we even had language for it,” she said.Hasan said her fieldwork included around 40 detailed case studies from Lucknow district alone. “Justice should reach every last woman,” she added. Petitions challenging the practice of halala, including one filed by Hasan in 2021, have been pe-nding before Supreme Court.","Police in amroha, uttar pradesh, have invoked the law banning instant triple talaq. The woman's complaint detailed the ordeal. She said she was “gang-raped under false pretenses of halala carried out under threats, intimidation and coercion” halala finds no mention in indian statutory law.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127207267,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1319945,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
"Patent rejected for MNC’s cancer drug, generics to follow",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/patent-rejected-for-mncs-cancer-drug-generics-to-follow/articleshow/127206094.cms,"Image: IANS

NEW DELHI: In what could be good news for patients, Indian Patent Office (IPO) has rejected MNC AbbVie’s patent application for its blockbuster cancer drug Venetoclax citing lack of inventive step. AbbVie markets the drug under the brand, Venclexta, in India. The company holds another patent on a composition of Venclexta, which is facing opposition in courts.IPO’s Delhi office declined to grant a patent on Venetoclax used in treatment of certain blood cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. The decision, if not challenged, paves way for entry of affordable generics in country, legal experts told TOI. The application faced sustained opposition at pre-grant stage, with seven parties filing challenges between 2018 and 2025. The patent office held that the claimed invention was “obvious” and lacked inventive step, a violation of Section 3(d) of Indian Patent Act.Section 3(d) bars patents on new forms or derivatives of known substances unless they demonstrate a significant enhancement in therapeutic efficacy, a provision aimed at preventing “evergreening” of pharmaceutical patents.It is the same provision under which Swiss firm Novartis lost patent on its blockbuster cancer drug, Glivec, in 2013. The order, accessed by TOI, said “claims of complete specification is not patentable under the Act, does not describe the invention”, and added it offered “no enhancement in therapeutic efficiency”, and hence, is a case of evergreening.Further, applicants have failed to give data of better therapeutic efficacy of compounds claimed in the present application over compounds disclosed in the prior art document, it added. “In absence of any biological data for all claimed compounds in the present specification, it cannot be decided whether the claims actually have the claimed anti-cancer activity or not. Hence, applicants have completely failed to establish any pharmacological activity and/or therapeutic efficacy for all the millions of claimed compounds,” the order said.","Indian patent office (ipo) has rejected mnc abbvie’s patent application for its blockbuster cancer drug venetoclax.

"HC: Apart from refunds, how will you compensate flyers?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-apart-from-refunds-how-will-you-compensate-flyers/articleshow/127204742.cms,"ANI file photo

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court directed IndiGo on Thursday to clarify how it intended to compensate flyers affected by the mayhem of cancellations last Dec, saying issuing refunds wasn’t quite the same as doing right by those who bore the brunt of the crisis.“Apart from refunding fares, what are the civil aviation rules for compensation? Please file an affidavit about compensation,” the bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyaya and Justice Tejas Karia told the counsel for the airline after he informed that the carrier had processed refunds for cancelled flights.The counsel submitted that for flights that were “most severely impacted”, IndiGo was offering vouchers worth Rs 10,000 to each passenger. He said a website has been set up for them to claim compensation. “You know who the flyers are; why do they need to claim compensation?” the bench responded. “Anyway, you file an affidavit to this effect in two weeks.”The court was hearing a PIL by advocates Akhil Rana and Utkarsh Sharma, seeking directions to Centre to provide support and refunds to passengers affected by cancellation of hundreds of flights by IndiGo during that period.They argued that compensation must be in the form of money instead of vouchers.The petitioners pointed out that IndiGo had issued travel vouchers to stranded passengers with a time limit for utilisation. When the airline’s counsel said the vouchers were valid for 12 months, the judges noted the time frame appeared reasonable. They sought to know if there were options for flyers who did not use the vouchers within that period.Civil aviation ministry and DGCA informed the court that steps have been taken by authorities to prevent a recurrence of the crisis.Based on the inquiry committee’s report, IndiGo’s senior vice-president for operations was asked to step down, and a penalty of Rs 22 crore was slapped on the airline for its failure to adhere to the new flight roster norms, Centre’s counsel said.He said the airline was directed to furnish a bank guarantee of Rs 50 crore to ensure compliance with regulatory directions and long-term systemic corrections, while warnings had been issued to the chief operating officer, director, deputy head of flight operations and a resource analyst.The inquiry report was submitted to court in a sealed cover. Between Dec 3 and 5, IndiGo cancelled 2,507 flights while 1,852 were delayed, impacting over three lakh passengers across country. The inquiry found out that the airline was not adequately prepared to implement the new flight duty norms for pilots.",Delhi high court directed indigo to clarify how it intended to compensate flyers affected by the mayhem of cancellations last dec.

Meitei visiting Kuki fiancee shot dead on camera,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/meitei-visiting-kuki-fiancee-shot-dead-on-camera/articleshow/127203749.cms,"PTI file photo

IMPHAL: A Meitei man visiting his Kuki fiancee in Manipur's hill district of Churachandpur was abducted and shot dead on camera Wednesday evening, a killing that jolted the state with graphic footage, street protests and an order for an NIA probe.M Rishikanta, 31, was allegedly dragged away by armed miscreants from his fiancee's home at Tuibong village in Churachandpur district southwest of Imphal around 6.30pm. Police said his body was found hours later near Natjang village in the same district. A case has been registered and search operations launched.Rishikanta worked as a technical engineer in Nepal, family members said. He had arrived before Christmas and had been staying in Churachandpur since Dec 19. The couple had sought permission from Kuki National Organisation, an umbrella group of Kuki insurgent outfits, for his stay. KNO denied knowledge of the visit and any role in the killing.A video circulated widely on social media showed his final moments, with the gunmen shooting him twice despite his pleas. The clip carried a message reading: ""No Peace, No Popular Government.""An autopsy was conducted Thursday in Churachandpur.Family members identified the body over a video call, unable to travel to the hill district amid security concerns. Kakching police facilitated the process, and the body was to be handed over later in the day.Manipur has remained deeply fractured since ethnic violence erupted in May 2023 between Meiteis and Kuki-Zo tribal communities, leaving communities effectively sealed off from one another. Even now, civilians rarely cross into areas identified with rival groups. Periodic flare-ups such as the one in Churachandpur keep the state on edge.Protests erupted Thursday at Kakching Khunou, Rishikanta's native village in Kakching district, where residents blocked an arterial road. To douse tensions, Governor AK Bhalla told a delegation of a Joint Action Committee led by Lok Sabha MP Angomcha Bimol Akoijam that the case would be handed to NIA for a ""thorough and impartial"" inquiry, according to an official release.The governor further said that intensive combing operations were under way ""on a war footing"", with coordinated deployment of state and central forces to track those responsible.JAC urged steps to prevent similar killings, called for intensified action against armed Kuki militants in the hills, and sought disciplinary action against Churachandpur's police chief and central forces deployed there, alleging failure to take preventive measures.","M rishikanta, 31, was allegedly dragged away by armed miscreants.

Airport response







BENGALURU: A South Korean businesswoman has accused an airline ground-handling employee of sexually assaulting her at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport, allegedly under the pretext of “manual frisking”.The 32-year-old woman was returning to South Korea on Monday when the incident occurred in the international departures area of Terminal 2, shortly after she had cleared immigration and security checks.According to the woman’s complaint, the incident took place around 10.45am.A man approached her after she had completed Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) frisking and immigration formalities, identified himself as airport staff and asked to see her boarding pass.He then claimed there was a problem with her checked-in baggage, saying a beeping sound had been detected and that resolving the issue would take time.He allegedly suggested an alternative — what he described as “manual frisking” — and asked her to accompany him.Police said the woman was taken to an area near the men’s washroom. There, under the guise of inspection, the man allegedly touched her chest multiple times, asked her to turn around and then touched her private parts.When the woman objected, he allegedly hugged her, thanked her and told her she could leave.The Kempegowda International Airport police said the accused has been identified as Mohammed Affaann Ahmed, 25, a ground-handling staff member.Police said he had no authority to physically inspect passengers.According to investigators, the woman later reported the incident to airport security staff, who immediately detained the accused and alerted airport police. CCTV footage from the terminal is said to corroborate key aspects of her account.A case has been registered against Ahmed under Section 75 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), which deals with sexual harassment. He was arrested and remanded to judicial custody, and has been lodged in Central Jail at Parappana Agrahara.Airport authorities said frisking and physical checks are conducted only by authorised CISF personnel and in the case of female passengers, by female staff.AISATS spokesperson said, ""An unpardonable incident was reported at Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru. The employee involved was immediately terminated and handed over to the authorities for further legal action. We deeply regret the emotional distress caused by the incident and have extended all necessary support to the guest. A comprehensive inquiry is underway to strengthen safeguards and prevent any recurrence. AISATS is fully cooperating with the authorities and remains committed to the highest standards of ethics, safety, and compliance.""They said any airport employee who suspects an issue with a passenger or baggage is required to alert CISF or immigration officials and has no right to carry out physical checks.Police said the investigation is ongoing.",A south korean businesswoman has accused an airline ground-handling employee of sexually assaulting her at bengaluru’s kempegowda international airport.

NEW DELHI: Sanjeev Khirwar, a 1994-batch IAS officer, was appointed as the new municipal commissioner of Delhi, more than three years after he was shifted out of the capital following a dog-walking row. He is likely to take charge on Thursday.Khirwar was moved out of Delhi in 2022 after he was embroiled in a controversy over walking his dog at the Thyagaraj Stadium.Athletes and coaches training at Thyagraj Stadium in Delhi had alleged that they were asked to wrap up training earlier than usual, by 7pm, as Khirwar and his wife, Rinku Dugga, also a 1994 batch IAS officer, had to walk their dog there. Khirwar was Delhi's principal secretary (revenue) at that time.Then Thyagraj administrator Ajit Chaudhary had refuted the allegations and said the official time for athletes to train was till 7pm and coaches and athletes would leave after that. Khirwar, too, had denied the allegations, terming them ""absolutely incorrect."" However, athletes claimed they usually used to train until 8.30pm, but were forced to wrap up their training by 7pm, disrupting their routines. He was subsequently transferred to Ladakh.In Ladakh Khirwar served as principal secretary handling key departments, including health and medical education. He was transferred back to a post in Delhi earlier this month from Ladakh as part of a major revamp of AGMUT-cadre IAS and IPS officers by the Ministry of Home Affairs.Khirwar will succeed Ashwani Kumar, a 1992-batch IAS officer of the AGMUT cadre, who was transferred to Jammu and Kashmir earlier this month.MCD, the city’s primary civic body, is responsible for sanitation, public health, roads and other municipal services.Khirwar’s appointment comes at a time when the corporation is grappling with several administrative and financial challenges, and many projects are pending for implementations. Stray problem and the setting up of shelters for dogs will be among his responsibilities.Khirwar previously served as private secretary to the Union minister for Women and Child Development between 2009 and 2014.His wife Rinku Dugga, too, was transferred in 2022 to Arunachal Pradesh, where she served as principal secretary of the Indigenous Affairs Department. She was given compulsory retirement under service rules in Sept 2023.","Sanjeev khirwar, a 1994-batch ias officer, was appointed as the new municipal commissioner of delhi.

BJP Targets Mamata Banerjee Over ED Raid At I-PAC, Alleges Evidence Tampering

NEW DELHI: SC Thursday refused to restrain ED from accessing information from the mobile phone of I-PAC functionary Jitendra Mehta, which was seized during a search on Jan 8 at the political consultancy firm's Delhi office. Mehta has been summoned for questioning at the ED headquarters on Friday.Appearing before a bench headed by CJI Surya Kant, senior advocate C A Sundaram said allowing Enforcement Directorate to open the phone would violate Mehta's privacy and pleaded that ED be restrained from doing so till the next date of hearing on Tuesday. But the bench asked him ""why are you so afraid"".Sundaram said the apex court should intervene to protect his fundamental right, but the bench said, ""We know how to protect an innocent citizen"".

'Is CM so helpless': Bombay HC raps Maharashtra government; Sena minister's son evades arrest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/is-cm-so-helpless-bombay-hc-raps-maharashtra-government-sena-ministers-son-evades-arrest/articleshow/127181472.cms,"“Democracy Sliding Into ICU”: Opposition Targets BJP As BMC Polls Trigger Political Storm

NEW DELHI: The Bombay high court on Thursday came down sharply on the Maharashtra government, questioning whether the rule of law prevails in the state and asking if the chief minister was too ""helpless"" to act against a cabinet minister whose son has been evading arrest for weeks.The remarks were made by Justice Madhav Jamdar while hearing applications linked to a violent clash during the Mahad Municipal Council elections in Raigad district, news agency PTI reported.The case involves Vikas Gogawale, son of Shiv Sena minister Bharat Gogawale, and Shreeyansh Jagtap, son of former MLA Manik Jagtap and a leader of the NCP.Violence had erupted on December 2 during the civic polls between supporters of the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena and the Ajit Pawar-led NCP, both allies in the BJP-led government. Cross FIRs were registered following the clash.Vikas Gogawale and his cousin Mahesh, key accused in the case, were denied pre-arrest bail, while Shreeyansh Jagtap was granted interim protection from arrest in December. Applications opposing Jagtap’s anticipatory bail were filed by Vikas and Mahesh Gogawale.Taking note of the police’s failure to arrest the minister’s son after his anticipatory bail plea was rejected by a sessions court, Justice Jamdar asked, ""Is the state’s chief minister so helpless that he cannot say anything against even one minister? Ministers’ children commit crimes and roam freely ... they remain in touch with their parents, yet the police cannot find them?”The judge added that while there may be pressure on the police, “there is no pressure on the court,” and questioned whether law and order was being effectively enforced.Following the court’s rebuke, the government assured compliance. Advocate General Milind Sathe told the bench that the minister would ensure his son’s surrender within a day. The court accepted the assurance, directed Vikas Gogawale to surrender before the next hearing, and posted the matter for Friday.","Bombay high court questions whether rule of law prevails in maharashtra.

JAMMU: Ten Army soldiers were killed and 11 wounded around noon Thursday when an armoured troop carrier skidded off a narrow mountain road in J&K and plunged nearly 200ft into a gorge. The six-wheel truck was heading to a counterterrorism operation in the upper reaches of Doda district, a remote, forested area in the Jammu region, when it lost traction near Khanni Top — a 9,000ft-high pass on Bhaderwah–Chamba interstate road that links J&K with Himachal Pradesh.An Army-police joint rescue effort began immediately after the crash, which occurred in bad weather on a steep stretch of road carved into the mountains. “The vehicle carrying troops for an operation slipped off the road while navigating treacherous terrain in bad weather,” White Knight Corps said in a post on X.Four soldiers died at the crash site. Others died of injuries while being evacuated or after reaching hospital, officials said. At least 10 of the injured were airlifted to the Army’s Northern Command Hospital in Udhampur. One injured soldier remains under observation at a sub-district hospital in Bhaderwah town, about 190km northeast of Jammu city, and is reported to be stable.The troops were traveling in a bulletproof Casspir — also known as Casper — a mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicle designed to shield soldiers from land mines and roadside bombs.PM Narendra Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, Lt governor Manoj Sinha, CM Omar Abdullah and Northern Command GoC-in-C Lt Gen Pratik Sharma expressed grief and condolences to the families of the dead, and wished a speedy recovery to the injured.“Deeply anguished by the mishap in Doda, in which we have lost our brave army personnel. Their service to the nation will be remembered forever. May the injured recover at the earliest. All possible support is being provided to those affected,” Modi posted on X.The crash adds to a series of fatal accidents involving military vehicles in the mountainous terrain of J&K and Ladakh, where narrow roads, sharp bends and frequent landslides pose constant risks. Thursday’s accident took the toll to 30 since 2023.In July 2025, a Lt Col and a soldier were killed when a boulder struck a convoy vehicle in eastern Ladakh. In Jan last year, four soldiers died after their truck rolled down a hillside in Bandipora district of north Kashmir. Five soldiers were killed in Dec 2024 when a truck plunged into a gorge in Poonch district near the LoC.

SRINAGAR: Kashmir Valley and Pir Panjal regions in J&K may witness major snowfall from early Friday, with India Meteorological Department (IMD), Srinagar, forecasting that back-to-back western disturbances will impact the region’s weather pattern for almost a week.Authorities have stepped up preparedness at the district level. Kulgam Deputy Commissioner Athar Aamir Khan said as a precautionary measure, 232 pregnant women expected to deliver in the district this week had already been hospitalised to ensure uninterrupted medical care during the harsh winter spell.With a rainfall deficit of 96% this month, J&K has witnessed an arid winter, leading to forest fires and the drying up of rivers and streams. IMD Srinagar director Mukhtar Ahmad on Thursday said weather conditions would change early Friday onwards, with moderate to heavy rainfall and heavy snowfall likely in parts of south Kashmir. North Kashmir may see moderate to heavy snow.Ahmad warned that the weather situation would disrupt traffic and trigger landslides on major highways, including Srinagar–Leh highway; Mughal Road, which connects Kashmir Valley to Poonch district in Jammu division, and Razdan Pass, a high-altitude mountain pass connecting north Kashmir’s Bandipora district with the scenic Gurez Valley on the LoC.The changing weather conditions could also affect air traffic on Friday, Ahmad said, adding that high-altitude areas — including Zojila Pass, Gulmarg and parts of Kupwara — were expected to receive two to three feet of snowfall.With another western disturbance likely to affect the region from Jan 26, Ahmad advised farmers to postpone agricultural activities till Jan 28. He said light rain was expected on Jan 24-25, and another active phase will commence from Jan 26 when moderate rain and snowfall was expected at most places across Kashmir Valley.J&K traffic department issued an advisory urging people to plan travel carefully. It requested commuters to confirm road conditions with traffic control units in Srinagar, Ramban and Jammu before embarking on the journey.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of home affairs on Thursday notified the schedule for upcoming houselisting and housing phase of Census 2027, replicating each of the 33 questions that were proposed to be asked in Census 2021 before the pandemic forced its postponement.The fields of information sought to be collected in the housing phase of Census, scheduled to be conducted between April 1 and Sept 30, include the building number; predominant material of floor, wall and roof of the census house; use of the census house and its condition; as well as household number.Information will have to be furnished on total number of persons residing in the household, name and sex of the head of the household; and if he/she belongs to the SC, ST or other category. Also included are fields pertaining to ownership status of the house; number of dwelling rooms in possession of the household; and number of married couples residing in the household.As regards amenities, respondents will need to apprise the census authority - either digitally through the census app or during the enumerator's visit - of the main source of drinking water, main source of lighting, access to and type of latrine, waste water outlet and availability of bathing facility.Information will also be sought on availability of LPG or CNG connection in the household and the main fuel used for cooking.

The party asked them to instead work together to ensure Congress return to power in the upcoming 2027 assembly elections.The order came during a three-hour meeting convened by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge at his residence in New Delhi, which was also attended by Rahul Gandhi, amid reports of infighting within the state unit, news agency PTI reported.Punjab goes to the polls in early 2027, and Congress is aiming to reclaim the state from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).Party leaders were asked to refrain from making statements against one another and were assured that there would be no immediate change in the state leadership.

Going to the media or spreading such issues on social media will not be tolerated,” Venugopal told reporters.He said the leadership had given a “very clear direction” and that all leaders present had unanimously agreed to it. On speculation about a leadership change in Punjab, Venugopal said there was “no question of it at present”.Addressing concerns raised by some leaders over representation of weaker sections, Venugopal said the Congress remained committed to ensuring adequate representation of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, OBCs and economically weaker sections, including in Punjab. However, he stressed that such issues must be raised internally.“We have told the state leadership not to make statements in public. From tomorrow onwards, you will see the Congress united. We will fight the elections together and win Punjab,” he said.On reports of some leaders writing jointly to Rahul Gandhi seeking a separate discussion, Venugopal said individual requests were acceptable but “group activities” would not be tolerated. “If anyone wants to meet Rahul ji, they can write individually,” he said, adding that Kharge and Gandhi were planning a visit to Punjab soon.",The party asked them to instead work together to ensure congress return to power in the upcoming 2027 assembly elections.

Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Thursday revoked Stage-III restrictions under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi-NCR after a sustained improvement in air quality, with the city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) moving out of the ‘severe’ zone.In an order issued by the CAQM, it said Delhi’s AQI stood at 322 on Thursday, aided by favourable meteorological conditions. Forecasts by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) indicate that air quality is likely to remain in the ‘moderate’ to ‘poor’ category in the coming days.Following a review by the sub-committee on GRAP, the commission decided to revoke Stage-III (‘severe’ category) measures with immediate effect. However, actions under GRAP Stage-I and Stage-II will continue across the NCR to prevent any further deterioration in air quality.Under Stage-III curbs, which were in force until Thursday, non-essential construction and demolition activities were banned. This included earthwork, piling, open trenching, welding, painting, plastering, tile and flooring work, as well as operations at ready-mix concrete (RMC) plants.The transportation of construction materials such as cement, sand and fly ash on unpaved roads was also prohibited. Stone crushers, brick kilns, mining activities and industries operating on unapproved fuels were ordered to shut.Vehicular restrictions included a ban on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel four-wheelers, non-essential diesel-powered medium goods vehicles and inter-state diesel buses not running on CNG, electricity or BS-VI standards. Exemptions, however, were provided for essential services, with infrastructure and public utility projects including metro, railways, airports, highways, defence, healthcare and sanitation allowed to continue.The CAQM clarified that construction and demolition sites shut for specific violations will not be allowed to resume work without explicit permission. It also urged enforcement agencies to maintain strict vigil during the winter season and requested the citizens to strictly adhere to the citizen charter under GRAP Stage 1 and Stage 2 to prevent any further deterioration in air quality.",The commission for air quality management (caqm) on thursday revoked stage-iii restrictions under the graded response action plan (grap) in delhi-ncr.

1984 Anti-Sikh Riots: Delhi Court Acquits Ex-Congress MP Sajjan Kumar In Vikaspuri, Janakpuri Case

Proof beyond a reasonable doubt must, asserts judge



NEW DELHI: Holding that the prosecution failed to meet the standard of proof required, a Delhi court acquitted former Congress MP Sajjan Kumar Thursday in a case arising from the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, reports Koushiki Saha. Kumar, however, will remain in jail as he is serving a life term in another riot-linked case where he was convicted by the Delhi high court.""A witness who has suffered the loss of a family member at the hands of a criminal would not spare such a criminal and would try to name the criminal at the earliest opportunity,"" special judge Dig Vinay Singh observed.Special judge Dig Vinay Singh said that there was ""no reliable evidence"" to establish ex-Cong MP Sajjan Kumar's presence at the crime scene on Nov 1, 1984, or to show that he instigated a mob, was part of an unlawful assembly, or entered into any criminal conspiracy.Reiterating settled principles of criminal law, the court noted that ""a man may be convicted of 100 crimes, but to be held guilty of the 101st crime, proof beyond a reasonable doubt in that crime is required"".The case stemmed from allegations of large-scale violence in west Delhi's Janakpuri and Vikaspuri areas following the assassination of PM Indira Gandhi on Oct 31, 1984. FIRs were registered much later, in 2015, accusing Kumar of leading mobs involved in killings, arson, looting and destruction of Sikh property, including setting fire to a gurdwara.He was booked under multiple provisions of the Indian Penal Code, including murder, attempted murder, rioting armed with deadly weapons, promoting enmity between groups, defiling a place of worship and dacoity.A central issue before the court was the reliability of the prosecution's evidence. After examining the testimonies of 18 prosecution witnesses, the court found that many were either ""hearsay witnesses"" or individuals who named the accused for the first time decades after the incident. One key witness admitted that she had not personally witnessed the incident involving Sohan Singh and his son-in-law and had not seen Kumar at the scene.The witness further conceded that neither she nor her family had named Kumar in any statement prior to 2016, despite his well-known identity in the area, naming him first time before the court. Judge Singh held that such testimony was barred by hearsay principles and did not qualify as ""res gestae"" evidence under Section 4 of the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, as the statements were neither contemporaneous with nor immediately connected to the incident.While accepting the prosecution's argument, led by Additional Public Prosecutor Manish Rawat- that victims suffered ""severe injuries, loss of life, destruction of property, and police inaction,"" the court still expressed its dissatisfaction over the prolonged silence of the witnesses for three long decades, warning that reliance on such delayed identification could result in a ""travesty.""Though Judge Singh acknowledged the trauma faced by families affected by the riots, but clarified that emotions could not override legal standards. He held that since Kumar was an Ex-Member of Parliament the Court cannot lower the standard of proof required in the case in hand to hold him guilty.Noting that it was impossible for Kumar to present at multiple locations simultaneously, the court indicated that given Kumar's wide involvement in similar cases at the relevant time, he had been named in this case as well.In Feb last year, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Jaswant Singh and his son Tarundeep Singh during the riots in Delhi's Saraswati Vihar area. He is currently lodged in Tihar Jail, where he is also serving a separate life term imposed by the Delhi high court in 2018 for the killing of five Sikhs in Palam Colony during the 1984 riots.The FIR was registered in 1992 pursuant to recommendations of the Justice J D Jain-DK Aggarwal Committee. After earlier investigations resulted in closure reports, the case was reopened following the constitution of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) in 2015. The FIR lodged in Janakpuri pertains to the Nov 1, 1984, killing of two men - Sohan Singh and his son-in-law Avtar Singh.The second FIR was lodged in the case of one Gurcharan Singh, who was allegedly set ablaze by a mob on Nov 2, 1984.While a Delhi court in Aug 2023 dropped charges of murder and criminal conspiracy in both cases, it proceeded to try him for rioting and promoting enmity between communities.","Former congress mp sajjan kumar acquitted in case arising from 1984 anti-sikh riots.

'To Remove Corrupt DMK': TTV Dhinakaran Meets Goyal As AMMK Rejoins NDA Ahead Of Tamil Nadu Polls

Tamil Nadu governor's walkout

Karnataka governor's walkout

Kerala governor cuts short address

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Thursday said his party DMK would consult like-minded opposition parties to move a constitutional amendment to end the practice of the governor’s address at the start of the first assembly session.This comes after a series of confrontations in Opposition-ruled states where governors refused to read state government-approved speeches.Reacting to recent walkouts and curtailed addresses in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, Stalin accused governors of acting like “party agents” and undermining elected governments. In a post on X, he said the pattern was “clear and deliberate” and argued that abolishing the Governor’s address was now the only solution.“First Tamil Nadu. Then Kerala. Now Karnataka. The pattern is clear and deliberate. Governors refusing to read the speech prepared by state governments and behaving like party agents, undermining duly elected state governments,” Stalin wrote.He added, “As I stated earlier, the only solution now is to end the practice of commencing the first annual Assembly session with the Governor’s address. DMK will consult like-minded opposition parties across India and pursue a constitutional amendment in the very next parliamentary session to abolish this obsolete and irrelevant practice.”Stalin’s remarks come two days after Tamil Nadu governor RN Ravi walked out of the Assembly before delivering his inaugural address, alleging disrespect to the national anthem and claiming his microphone was switched off.The episode led to sharp exchanges inside the House, with Speaker M Appavu urging the governor to follow established Assembly conventions.Raj Bhavan later issued a statement defending the walkout and alleging that issues such as atrocities against Dalits and sexual violence against Dalit women were omitted from the government’s speech. Opposition AIADMK leaders also staged a walkout over law and order issues.A similar standoff unfolded in Karnataka today, when Governor Thawarchand Gehlot delivered only two lines of his customary address and walked out of the joint sitting of the Assembly and Council, refusing to read the full Cabinet-approved speech.The shortened address triggered chaos in the House, with Congress members raising slogans and accusing the governor of violating constitutional norms.Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah said the governor’s conduct amounted to a breach of the Constitution and that the government was considering legal options.Explaining the government’s stand, Siddaramaiah said the address prepared by the Cabinet had included objections to the Union government’s decision to replace MGNREGA with the Viksit Bharat–Rozgar aur Ajeevika Mission (Rural), a move his government strongly opposes.In a detailed statement on X, Siddaramaiah said, “By not reading the address prepared by the Cabinet at the first joint session of the year, the Hon’ble Governor of Karnataka has violated the Constitution. This act amounts to an affront to the House of elected representatives.”He added that under Articles 176 and 163, the governor is bound to read the address prepared by the Council of Ministers and has no authority to substitute it with a speech of his own.The Karnataka CM also linked the confrontation to substantive policy differences, particularly over rural employment. He said the new law replacing MGNREGA diluted guaranteed employment, removed decentralised decision-making powers of gram sabhas and panchayats, and disproportionately affected women, Dalits, workers and small farmers.“By refusing to read the Cabinet-prepared address, the Governor has violated constitutional provisions and insulted the Legislature,” Siddaramaiah said, adding that the Congress government, along with legislators, would protest the move and examine legal remedies, including approaching the Supreme Court.In Kerala, Governor Arif Mohammed Khan drastically curtailed his customary policy address to the Assembly at the start of the Budget session, delivering what became the shortest such speech in the House’s history. The address lasted just one minute and 18 seconds, with the governor reading only the first line and the concluding paragraph of the original 62-page speech.By doing so, Khan technically fulfilled his constitutional obligation, but his action raised serious questions over whether differences with the elected government should extend to the Assembly, which represents the will of the entire state. The entire exercise, including the national anthem, concluded in under five minutes, after which the governor left the House.The back-to-back confrontations have reignited a wider debate on the limits of administrative discretion. Constitutional experts have warned that refusing to deliver a Cabinet-approved address could invite judicial scrutiny, observing that while governors may express reservations, the Constitution mandates that the address be delivered to the House.","Stalin accuses governors of acting like ‘party agents’ and undermining elected governments.

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Thursday acquitted former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in two cases filed by the Enforcement Directorate over his failure to appear before the agency in the Delhi excise policy probe.The order was passed by additional chief judicial magistrate Paras Dalal at the Rouse Avenue Courts. The Enforcement Directorate had approached the court in February 2024, seeking action against Kejriwal for not complying with summons issued under Section 50 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The agency said Kejriwal had not appeared despite being summoned five times in connection with its investigation.The money laundering probe stems from a case registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation on August 17, 2022, over alleged irregularities in the Delhi excise policy for 2021–22.The CBI case was based on a complaint filed by Delhi Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena on July 20, 2022. Following this, the ED registered its own case on August 22, 2022, to investigate the money laundering angle.Kejriwal was later arrested in the main excise policy case.He was eventually granted bail by the Supreme Court.The excise policy was scrapped in 2022 after lieutenant governor ordered a CBI probe into alleged irregularities and corruption involving its formulation and execution. According to CBI and ED, irregularities were committed while modifying the excise policy, and undue favours were extended to licence holders.AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan was also acquitted on Thursday in one case and discharged in another related to his alleged non-compliance with summons issued by the Enforcement Directorate in the Delhi Waqf Board Money laundering case.","A delhi court on thursday acquitted former delhi chief minister arvind kejriwal.

In the meantime, SC allowed Hindu and Muslim communities to perform Basant Panchami and Friday prayers respectively within the compound in separate demarcated areas.As Saraswati Puja will be celebrated on a Friday this year, a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant, Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul Pancholi appealed to both communities to show tolerance and mutual respect while holding their prayers and also cooperate with the district administration to maintain law and order in the area.With the Hindu side pleading with the court that they should be allowed to hold puja throughout the day as Saraswati puja is a day-long ritual and the Muslim side saying Juma Namaz can happen only between 12.30 pm and 3.00 pm, the bench decided to allow them to perform their rituals at the same time in the compound but in different corners. The court passed the order after additional solicitor general K M Nataraj, appearing for the state, assured that all necessary arrangements would be put in place to maintain law and order.The bench then asked senior advocate Salman Khurshid, appearing for the Muslim side, to brief the state govt on the number of people who would be offering namaz on Friday so that proper arrangements could be made. The court clarified that the namaz would be allowed between 1pm and 3pm while Basant Panchmi celebrations would be allowed all day.“A fair suggestion was given that in the afternoon, for namaz within 1pm and 3pm, an exclusive and separate area within the same compound, including separate ingress and egress within the same compound, shall be made available so that namaz can be performed. Similarly, a separate space shall be made available to the Hindu community to hold traditional ceremonies on the occasion of Basant Panchami... Administration may, with a view to ensure the maintenance of law and order, issue passes for the visitors or may adopt any other fair means to ensure that no untoward incident happens,” the bench said. “We appeal to both sides to observe mutual respect and trust towards each other.”The 11th century monument is at the centre of a dispute between Hindus and Muslims. Hindus believe it is a temple of goddess Vagdevi, an incarnation of goddess Saraswati, while the Muslim community calls it the Kamal Maula mosque.Advocates Vishnu Jain and Ashwini Upadhyay, appearing for Hindu side, pleaded with the court to expedite the hearing in Madhya Pradesh high court where the case arising from the dispute over religious character of Bhojshala Saraswati Temple cum Maulana Kamal Maula Mosque, has been pending. They told the court that proceedings in the case were not moving forward because of the apex court’s stay order even though the Archaeological Society of India (ASI) had filed its report in a sealed envelope.The bench thereafter asked the HC that the case be taken up by a division bench preferably headed by the Chief Justice or senior most judge and by opening the sealed envelope. It directed that the report be unsealed in open court and a copy to it be given to both sides. “Till the writ is finally decided, the parties shall maintain the status quo at the site,” the court said.","The 11th century monument is at the centre of a dispute between hindus and muslims.
