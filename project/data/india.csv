'We are proud of it': Two Himachal brothers marry same woman in tribal polyandry tradition; video viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-are-proud-of-it-two-himachal-brothers-marry-same-woman-in-tribal-polyandry-tradition-videos-go-viral/articleshow/122792576.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a rare yet culturally rooted event, two brothers from Himachal Pradesh’s Hatti tribe have married the same woman, reviving an age-old tradition of polyandry.The ceremony took place in Shillai village of Sirmaur district’s Trans-Giri area, with hundreds attending the three-day celebration that began on July 12.The bride, Sunita Chauhan from Kunhat village, married Pradeep and Kapil Negi in accordance with the tribal custom known as ""Jodidara"", which is recognised under Himachal Pradesh’s revenue laws.“I made this decision without any pressure. I respect the bond we have formed,” Sunita told PTI. Pradeep, who works in a government department, and Kapil, employed abroad, said the marriage was a joint, transparent decision. “We followed the tradition publicly as we are proud of it,” Pradeep told PTI. Meanwhile, Kapil said, “We’re ensuring support, stability and love for our wife as a united family.”Videos from the wedding, which featured local folk music and dance, have gone viral on social media, drawing attention to the once-prevalent tradition.The Hatti tribe, a close-knit community living along the Himachal-Uttarakhand border, was granted Scheduled Tribe status three years ago.Polyandry, though rare now, is still practised in parts of the region including Trans-Giri, Jaunsar Babar in Uttarakhand, and Kinnaur in Himachal Pradesh.According to village elders, such marriages continue discreetly and are accepted socially, though fewer in number due to growing literacy among women and economic development.Kundan Singh Shastri, general secretary of Kendriya Hatti Samiti, explained the tradition’s roots to PTI. “Polyandry helped prevent the division of ancestral land, encouraged brotherhood, and ensured a feeling of security in tribal life. It was also practical for managing scattered farmlands in the hills,” he said.In the Hatti tradition known as ""Jajda"", the bride arrives in a procession to the groom’s home where rituals including ""Seenj"" are performed. A local priest chants mantras, sprinkles holy water, and offers jaggery to the couple, blessing them with sweetness in their married life from the family deity.(with inputs from news agency PTI)",Two brothers from himachal pradesh's hatti tribe have married the same woman.

She alleged the boy had stalked her on her way to school while Shahbaj pressured her to befriend him.The FIR invoked sections 61(2) (criminal conspiracy) and 351(2) (criminal intimidation) of BNS, and sections 17 (abetment), 8 (sexual assault) and 12 (sexual harassment of a child) under Pocso. The defence counsel, SS Nehra, argued that the accused was falsely implicated.However, additional sessions judge Ranjana Aggarwal, in her July 17 order, said Shahbaj systematically tried to force an interfaith relationship through “allurement and inducement.” The court awarded him four years under Pocso Section 8, two years under Section 12, and one year under BNS Section 351(2), with fines totalling Rs 1 lakh.

NEW DELHI: A day after Devendra Fadnavis , in a light-hearted comment, invited Uddhav Thackeray to ""come to the ruling side,"" the Shiv Sena UBT chief met the Maharashtra chief minister on Thursday.According to the ANI, the meeting between Fadnavis and Thackeray took place in the office of Legislative Council Chairman Ram Shinde. Their meeting lasted about 20 minutes.On Wednesday, Fadnavis said that Thackeray ""can come to the ruling side in a different way."" While addressing the Maharashtra assembly, the CM said that till 2029, there is no scope for the BJP to come to the opposition side.""At least till 2029, there is no scope for us to come there (opposition). Uddhav Ji can think about the scope of coming to this side (ruling party) and that can be thought about in a different way, but there is absolutely no scope left for us to come there (opposition),"" Fadnavis said.The Shiv Sena and BJP's alliance bloomed till 2014. But, their 25-year partnership hit a rough patch during the 2014 Maharashtra Assembly elections due to a seat-sharing dispute. And finally in 2019, after winning the election, Uddhav ditched BJP and joined hands with Congress.However, Fadnavis had his revenge two and a half years later when Eknath Shinde revolted against Uddhav and split the Shiv Sena. Since then, Fadnavis has been with the Shinde Sena.Eknath Shinde, who served as chief minister for over two years after the 2022 coup, was reluctant to hand over the reins back to Fadnavis in 2024 after their alliance got an overwhelming mandate from the people of the state.Also Read: Can come to the ruling side': Fadnavis offers Uddhav Thackeray, says BJP not going to be in opposition 'at least till 2029 Fadnavis's statement came at a time when Uddhav Thackeray has intensified his attacks on the BJP and the Shinde-led government over the three-language policy, and when speculation about a patch-up between the estranged Thackeray cousins is gaining traction.Speculation has been mounting over the possible collaboration between UBT and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), especially after July 5, when Raj and Uddhav Thackeray shared a stage for the first time in two decades.T he rare show of unity came during a joint celebration of the Maharashtra government's decision to reverse two controversial orders mandating Hindi as a third language from Class 1 in state schools.Back in April, Raj Thackeray had already fuelled talk of a possible thaw, calling their past disagreements “trivial” and stressing that uniting for the cause of the Marathi manoos shouldn’t be difficult. Uddhav Thackeray echoed a similar tone shortly after, saying he was open to reconciliation—so long as it didn’t include those acting against Maharashtra’s interests.","Devendra fadnavis invited uddhav thackeray to ""come to the ruling side"" the shiv sena ubt chief met the maharashtra chief minister on thursday.

CHENNAI: Enforcement Directorate is not a “loitering munition or drone” that can strike at will, nor a “super cop” empowered to investigate every matter that comes to its notice, Madras HC has observed while quashing a Rs 901-crore fixed deposit freeze order issued by the agency.A division bench of Justices MS Ramesh and V Lakshminarayanan ruled that ED’s powers under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) can only be invoked when there is a scheduled offence — termed a “predicate offence” — and the existence of proceeds of crime arising from it. “PMLA demands the existence of a predicate offence.When there is no predicate offence, initiation of proceedings under PMLA is anonstarter,” the bench said. It likened ED’s jurisdiction to a limpet mine requiring a ship to function. “The ship is the predicate offence and proceeds of crime,” it added.The ruling came in response to a plea by RKM Powergen Pvt Ltd, which challenged ED’s January 31 order freezing its fixed deposits. The company, represented by senior advocate B Kumar, said the freeze disregarded earlier court rulings and lacked fresh material. RKMP was allocated the Fatehpur East coal block in 2006.The Supreme Court cancelled the allocation in 2014.CBI initially registered an FIR but closed the case in 2017. Despite this, ED launched a PMLA probe in 2015 and froze RKMP’s accounts, which was struck down by Madras HC earlier. Rejecting ED’s stand, HC said actions under PMLA must follow legally prescribed route and termed the freeze order “legally untenable.”",Madras high court quashes a rs 901-crore fixed deposit freeze order issued by the agency.

NEW DELHI: The road transport ministry has proposed doubling of penalty for traffic rule violation by people driving with children, a move that will ensure safety and responsibility. It has also proposed a ""merit and demerit (positive and negative) point system"" for all drivers based on their compliance with or violation of traffic rules.The changes have been proposed as part of amendments to the Motor Vehicles Act, and these have been circulated among ministries for their feedback, TOI has learnt. Sources said the proposal of doubling penalty for traffic rule violation has been made considering rampant non-compliance of norms by parents and family members driving with children and by buses owned or hired by schools to transport students. The higher penalty is aimed at making both drivers and vehicle owners responsible.However, a section of road safety experts feel that any addition to the list of offences may end up only as a ""better"" legislative exercise and another avenue for corruption, if not implemented objectively.""Even now traffic cops catch and penalise drivers only for half a dozen offences such as speeding, drunk driving, jumping red signal, using phone and not wearing seatbelt or helmet, while the MV law covers over 100 offences.How will cameras installed identify if a juvenile is sitting in the rear seat of a car and will police personnel stop vehicles and check the age of people sitting inside? While framing laws and policies we don't think of India but Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and big cities,"" an expert said.As far as the proposal of ""merit and demerit"" points system for drivers is concerned, govt will set a threshold for demerit points and any driver accumulating negative marks beyond that will face the risk of suspension and cancellation of his/her driving licence. The ministry has also proposed to link insurance premium to behaviour of drivers, which will be reflected through positive and negative points.Sources said the proposed amendments include mandatory driving test for DL holders applying for renewal before expiry of licence, if they have violated traffic rules.","The changes have been proposed as part of amendments to the motor vehicles act.

KOCHI: Bitra Island, one of the 10 inhabited isles in the Lakshadweep archipelago, is set to be taken over by government for defence purposes. There are 105 families on the island and many have opposed the move.The Lakshadweep revenue department has issued a notification, dated July 11, for a social impact assessment (SIA). It stated that the intention was to transfer the entire island to defence and strategic agencies considering its “strategic location” and “national security relevance”.Lakshadweep MP Hamdullah Sayeed alleged that the move was aimed at disrupting peace in the area and would be opposed tooth and nail.Lakshadweep MP vows to fight for Bitra islandersIn a video message, Lakshadweep MP Hamdullah Syeed asked Bitra natives not to worry or be anxious about the notification.“As your MP, we held a conference that included leaders from Bitra and Lakshadweep and discussed it in detail. We have decided to fight with the people of Bitra, politically and legally,” he said.Sayeed said the government had already acquired land required for defence purposes on several islands.Targeting Bitra, which has had an indigenous population for decades, without considering any alternative, is unacceptable. He also criticised the administration for not holding any consultation with the islanders.The notification said that a Social Impact Assessment (SIA) was needed as per provisions of the Right to Fair Compensation and Trans- parency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. Naming the department of revenue as the project developer, it said SIA activities included consultations with all stakeholders of the proposed area, including the gram sabha.“The SIA and Consent Society, UT of Lakshadweep, will complete the survey of the proposed area under acquisition within two months from the date of the notification,” it said, adding that consent of gram sabhas and/or landowners was not mandatory.","The lakshadweep revenue department has issued a notification, dated july 11, for a social impact assessment (sia) the intention was to transfer the entire island to defence and strategic agencies considering its ‘strategic location’ and ‘national security relevance’ there are 105 families on the island.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122772958,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-2953706,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Baghel’s son laundered Rs 16.7 crore through shell firms: ED to court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/baghels-son-laundered-rs-16-7-crore-through-shell-firms-ed-to-court/articleshow/122790101.cms,"Ex-CM’s son arrested to bury the truth, crush people’s voice, says Priyanka

RAIPUR: ED informed a special court that former Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel’s son Chaitanya Baghel laundered Rs 16.7 crore through shell firms and under-invoiced real estate deals tied to a Rs 2,100 crore liquor scam. Chaitanya was arrested under Prevention of Money Laundering Act on July 18 (his 38th birthday) following searches at his home.A PMLA court in Raipur granted five days’ remand. Congress functionaries responded to this with a call for statewide “Aarthik Nakabandi” on July 22. It has planned road blockades, protests, and mineral transport disruption across Chhattisgarh. The protest aligns with the final day of Chaitanya’s ED custody and his scheduled production before a PMLA court.According to ED’s remand report, Chaitanya played a “central and active role” in laundering illegal proceeds from a liquor syndicate that allegedly manipulated Chhattisgarh’s excise system from 2019 to 2022. One transaction flagged involved Rs 5 crore funnelled from Saheli Jewellers into a project, Vitthal Green, by Baghel Developers. While project costs were officially declared as Rs 7.14 crore, ED estimates actual expenditure between Rs 13 crore and Rs 15 crore — mostly in cash.Key witness Pappu Bansal told ED that only Rs 2.62 crore was recorded in payments to the contractor, while Rs 4.2 crore was allegedly paid off the books. On Oct 19, 2020, liquor businessman Trilok Singh Dhillon allegedly paid Rs 5 crore for 19 flats in the same project under employee names.CM Vishnu Deo Sai defended ED’s actions. “ED doesn’t act randomly. It knows what it’s doing,” he said Saturday. While ex-CM Baghel accused the Centre of vendetta politics. “They raided me during Budget session. Now, after Mahant’s adjournment notice on Hasdeo forest felling, they’ve targeted my son,” he said. “I won’t break. Let them jail him — he’s strong.”Baghel alleged a “selective pattern” of enforcement: “Nothing happens to Himanta Biswa Sarma, or Suvendu Adhikari, or Ajit Pawar. Those who bow walk free.”Congress’ Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Saturday claimed that as former Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel was about to raise the issue of govt “gifting” all the state’s forests to industrialist Adani in the assembly, govt arrested his son to pressure him to bury the truth. The public has understood that these tactics under BJP are aimed at crushing the voice of people but it will not succeed, she said.“The forests are being destroyed in defiance of PESA Act and NGT directives. Baghel was going to raise the issue in the assembly. To stop him, ED raided his house early in the morning and arrested his son. In past 11 years, the country has understood well that these are methods to suppress opposition. But every Congress worker stands firmly with Baghel,” Priyanka said.","Chaitanya baghel laundered rs 16.7 crore through shell firms and under-invoiced real estate deals tied to a rs 2,100 crore liquor scam.

VIJAYAWADA: YSRCP MP P V Midhun Reddy was arrested by Andhra SIT late on Saturday after nearly seven hours of questioning in the alleged Rs 3,200 crore liquor scam.

The SIT has reportedly tracked a Rs 5 crore fund transfer from a third-party company to a firm linked to the MP, raising suspicions of money laundering and quid pro quo arrangements.Officials believe Midhun Reddy possesses crucial information about the ultimate beneficiaries of the proceeds generated through the liquor policy.","Ysrcp mp p v midhun reddy was arrested by andhra sit late on saturday.
