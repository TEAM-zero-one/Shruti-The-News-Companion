"Junk the ghoonghat, walk the talk",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/junk-the-ghoonghat-walk-the-talk/articleshow/118401588.cms,"Married at 16, Ashalata Pandey of Ambajogai — a temple town known as the ‘maternal home of education’ in Maharashtra ’s Beed — had to hide her face after her husband left for a religious trip one fine day, from which he never returned.“Aren’t you sad about the fact that he left you?” “How can you simply move on?”These were just some of the questions that the young mother of two was bombarded with on her way to work at an NGO that fetched a meagre monthly pay of Rs 800, to raise awareness on a range of issues from women’s rights to reproductive health.Stung by such adverse comments, Ashalata quit her job. With no property of her own and no support from her in-laws, she took up the job of an ASHA worker. Covering her head, like a shroud, with the edge of her sari, she took deserted roads on her way to work to ensure she kept those inquisitive glares at bay.It was during one of those solitary walks to work that Ashalata had a chance encounter with Chitratai.Married off at 12 by an alcoholic father to a man desperately looking for dowry, Chitratai aka Chitra Patil was not just a cheerful health worker, but also a newly-minted ‘saheli’ who had freed several villagers from greedy money lenders by creating 14 savings groups that charged a 2% fixed interest rate.Encouraged by Chitratai, Ashalata enrolled herself for the grassroots leadership development programme ( GLDP ) and on the very third day of the course, she realised she was entitled to certain rights, including the right to her husband’s property.“My father-in-law owned a large house. I wanted to co-own it, rightfully. Now, I actually do,” says Ashalata, sharing her expe rience from being an ‘SW’ (single woman) to one of the many vocal, local leaders of Ekal Mahila Sangathana (EMS) -a women’s organisation in Marathwada that galvanises its 22,000-strong marginalised population of abandoned, separated, widowed women into becoming agents of social change.Ashalata is currently working on violence against women across Marathwada.Started a decade ago by 27 single women in Beed, Latur, Osmanabad and Nanded -the rustic western Maharashtra belt -EMS today boasts of nearly 22,000 members.Having rescued droves of single women from social stigma, unemployment and domestic violence, EMS is one of more than 500 organisations across Maharashtra and Rajasthan that have been facilitated by non-profit CORO India.“CORO stands for ‘Jyanche prashna tyanche netrutva’ (the question is the same as the truth). The drive to initiate change should come from within,” says Dr Sujata Khandekar, founder of the 34-yearold holistic community development NGO.Formed in 1989 by people from privileged backgrounds, CORO later evolved into “a people’s organisation, with people not as mere beneficiaries but as leaders of the organisation”, as Mahendra Rokade, the director of CORO, puts it.In the last three decades, its efforts in rural and urban Maharashtra and Rajasthan have created more than 1,688 “grassroots leaders”, of which, 69% are women -including transwomen.Majority of these earthy change-makers hail from notified and denotified tribes, backward classes, minorities and other marginalised communities. These leaders – aged between 20 and 50 – now address issues ranging from gender rights to forest rights.“Since women are constantly and consistently denied permission to do things since childhood and punished for transgressing those boundaries, later in their lives, women themselves start believing that they are lesser humans,” explains Khandekar.Culled over two decades, such insights paved the way for the Grassroots Leadership Training Programme (GLDP) -a syllabus spanning skills such as advocacy and constitutional rights that were inspired by Brazilian educator Paulo Freire’s philosophy of ‘conscientisation’. Meanwhile, EMS, which began working on ensuring safety and access to govt schemes for single women in areas where they were seen as “commodities up for grabs”, has now percolated into remote Rajasthan where Teena Rawat, who survived two suicide attempts after her husband abandoned her, now beams proudly inside a courtroom where she is defending herself as a lawyer. “If you hadn’t abandoned her,” the judge told her former husband against whom she had filed five cases, “this woman would have spent her whole life following you around in a ghoonghat. Instead, she’s a lawyer now. Look at how little you’ve achieved and how much she has done with her life”.CORO recently launched Atta Deep Academy of Grassroots Leadership in Mumbai as an extension of GLDP. “ ‘Atta Deep means selfenlightenment’,” says Khandekar.The arrival of four transwomen has expanded CORO’s lens on gender issues. Case studies in its 2023 annual report point to how issues addressed by grassroots women leaders transcend gender.Udaipur’s Durga -who learned how to open and operate a Facebook account during her fellowship -was surfing the net casually one day when she chanced upon a govt website listing the names of 42 villagers that had received money to build cattle sheds. “None of the people concerned even knew that their applications had been approved,” recalls Durga, who downloaded the receipts and armed with those printouts, the villagers then pressurized the sarpanch into giving them their rightful share.That’s change.

However, in its Dec 2011 orders, the lower court in Hisar refused to grant them possession of the land but asked them to accept compensation for the land.The bench held that since 1961, DHBVN had been using the land owned by plaintiffs without acquisition and without payment of compensation. Accordingly, appellants will have to pay user charges at the rate of Rs 1,000 per year starting 1961, with 10% enhancement every 10 years till the date of acquisition (Feb 2005) and interest at 6% per annum.

Rekha Gupta to be Delhi CM: Frontrunners lose race again as BJP picks first-time MLA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rekha-gupta-is-delhi-cm-bjp-surprises-again-picks-first-time-mla-over-heavyweights/articleshow/118393944.cms,"Rekha Gupta will be the only woman chief minister among the states being ruled by the BJP at present.

She enjoys close ties with the RSS and is actively engaged with women-related matters.

Gupta is also the national vice president of BJP Mahila Morcha and a member of the party's national executive.

She is a former president of the Delhi University Students' Union (DUSU) and a civic body councillor.

Rekha Gupta entered politics as an Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) member in 1992.

NEW DELHI: Another state, another surprise pick. The BJP has done it again. On Wednesday, the BJP, which returned to power in Delhi after 27 long years, picked first-time MLA Rekha Gupta as its chief minister. While the announcement ended days of suspense and speculation, it did reinforce the notion that being a heavyweight or a frontrunner for the top post in any BJP-ruled state is actually a disadvantage.The likes of Parvesh Verma , Vijender Gupta - party's old warhorses in Delhi, would perhaps have known the disadvantages of being frontrunners in this race even as they would have hoped for an exception from the party high command.When it comes to selecting chief ministers, the BJP's script has been the same - state after state. Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Odisha, Gujarat, Haryana - all these BJP-ruled states have chief ministers who were relatively unknown figures in the party till they were picked to lead the state. The heavyweights and the frontrunners in these states lost the race to the top post.With Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself leading the campaign in all state elections, the BJP uses CM pick keeping in mind long-term gains for the party.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Goa CM Pramod Sawant and Uttarakhand's Pushkar Singh Dhami are some of the BJP chief ministers who could buck the trend and continue with the top post after the party's victory.To that extent, Rekha Gupta should consider herself lucky as her name was also doing the rounds for the top post in Delhi. A number of factors could have helped Rekha Gupta pip the heavyweights, who played crucial role in BJP's victory.Immediately after the formal announcement, the Delhi CM-designate thanked the top BJP leadership for reposing confidence in her. ""I thank the top leadership from my heart for its belief in me for entrusting me with the post of Chief Minister. This faith and support have evoked a new energy and motivation in me. I pledge to strive with total honesty, commitment and dedication for the welfare of the residents of Delhi. I am fully committed to the significant responsibility of taking Delhi to a new pinnacle,"" she said in a post on X in Hindi.","Rekha gupta will be the only woman chief minister among the states being ruled by the bjp at present.

JKSA national convener Nasir Khuehami claimed Hamim had been subjected to ""months of harassment due to a power struggle"" as he captains the 2023-batch cricket team.The accused arrested have been identified as Mohammed Zainul, 23, from Vijayapura; Sameer, 24, from Sandur, Ballari district; Shaik Sawood, 23, from Mudagal, Raichur district; Mansoor Bhasha, 24, from Shiraguppa, Ballari district; and Muzzaffer alias Mujeeb Jamadar, 23, from Indi Taluk, Vijayapura district.The alleged incident took place Tuesday evening during a match between the 2019 and 2022 batches. ""While standing near the boundary line, a senior asked him to stay outside. He promptly moved away. As verbal intimidation escalated, seniors humiliated him, ordered him to perform an ‘Al-Ameen salute', sing songs, and dance for their amusement. They even attempted to force him into their car,"" Khuehami alleged.When Hamim refused, citing college regulations, tensions escalated. ""Sensing danger, he took out his phone to record the incident, hoping it would deter them. Instead, this enraged them. Later in the evening, 6-8 individuals stormed into his hostel room and assaulted him. They repeatedly beat him, forced him to record a video apologising under duress, and issued death threats, warning he would not be allowed to play cricket for the next four years,"" Khuehami added.Following a social-media post tagging PM Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, J&K CM Omar Abdullah, Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah and deputy CM DK Shivakumar, the matter drew attention of Vijayapura Rural police officials, who visited the college to conduct an inquiry.Dr Jilani Awati, medical college superintendent, said, ""The incident was a quarrel between two student teams during the cricket match. Hamim might have informed the Kashmiri student leader, who, unaware of the full context, sought help by tagging officials on social media.

‘Why sell excess tickets?’: HC to Railways on New Delhi station stampede,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-sell-excess-tickets-hc-to-railways-on-new-delhi-station-stampede/articleshow/118397969.cms,"NEW DELHI: In the wake of the recent stampede at New Delhi railway station that led to 18 deaths, Delhi high court on Wednesday asked the Indian Railways to address the sale of excess tickets beyond the number of passengers that can be accommodated in a coach.""If you fix the number of passengers to be accommodated in a coach, then why does the number of tickets sold exceed that number? That's the problem,"" a bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyay and Justice Tushar Rao Gedela told Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta, representing the Railways.The court was hearing a PIL over the recent stampede at the New Delhi railway station and asked the authorities to file an affidavit giving details of measures taken on these issues. The plea sought the implementation of existing provisions by Railways that may have helped avoid such incidents and cited sections 57 and 147 of the Railway Act that deal with overcrowding.""If you could implement a simple thing, such situations could be avoided... but not fixing the strength to be accommodated in a particular coach, this provision appears to have been neglected all along,"" HC remarked, while referring to Section 57 of the Railways Act, which says every railway administration must fix the maximum number of passengers allowed in each compartment of every carriage type.SG Mehta submitted that the PIL was not taken in an adversarial manner and the Railways is bound to follow the law. He said there was an ""unprecedented"" situation and assured the court that the issues raised in the PIL would be considered at the highest level. ""We are following the law, if there are any lacunae etc that can be taken care of,"" Mehta assured the court.During the hearing, the HC also pointed out that as per rules, the number of passengers that can be carried in each compartment should be ""conspicuously displayed outside each compartment"". It asked the SG to show what steps Railways will take to implement existing laws that limit the number of passengers in coaches and penalise persons entering without authority.""Let the issues raised in the petition be examined, as suggested by the SG, at the highest level at the Railway Board and thereafter an affidavit be filed giving details of the decisions taken by the Railway Board,"" the court directed, posting the matter for next month.HC noted that the PIL - filed by Arth Vidhi, an organisation of legal and business professionals - was not confined to the recent incident of the stampede as it sought implementation of the existing legal provisions with respect to the maximum number of passengers in a compartment and the sale of platform tickets.

NEW DELHI: Hit by the Covid pandemic, albeit later than intended, CBSE will roll out twice-a-year board exams for class X from 2026 and introduce the CBSE Global Curriculum for 260 foreign schools affiliated to it from 2026-2027.The education ministry held a discussion, led by minister Dharmendra Pradhan, with CBSE officials and heads of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) and Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS), where draft schemes, set for public consultation on next Monday, were thoroughly deliberated.Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has announced plans to implement multiple board exams annually, allowing students to take their exams twice and retain their best score. This reform aligns with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which emphasises flexibility and a student centric approach.According to a ministry official, “The initiative aims at reducing the high pressure, one-time examination system and provide students with an opportunity to improve their performance without the stress of a single high-stakes test. By offering multiple attempts, CBSE seeks to create a more supportive learning environment that prioritizes conceptual understanding over rote memorisation.”The policy advocates for competency-based evaluations over traditional summative assessments, shifting focus to formative learning and skill mastery. “CBSE is encouraging a shift towards formative learning, where students can focus on skill mastery and self-improvement rather than mere exam performance. This model also aligns with global best practices, such as the SAT system in the US, which allows students to take tests multiple times and submit their best scores,” said the official.The move also supports NEP’s goal of inclusivity, accommodating students facing challenges such as exam anxiety or illness. Providing multiple attempts ensures students from diverse backgrounds have a fair chance to showcase their abilities. CBSE is also scaling up teacher training to ensure a smooth transition toward this progressive assessment model.Pradhan emphasised that the new format is a crucial step towards a stress free learning environment. “Examination improvement and reform is a key step towards this. This reform will help mitigate exam-related stress and ensure a more balanced evaluation system,” he said.In addition, CBSE will also launch its Global Curriculum for foreign schools in 2026-2027. The curriculum will integrate core Indian subjects.","Cbse will roll out twice-a-year board exams for class x from 2026.

Poll How Can Water Contamination Risks Be Addressed at Major Events? Raise Public Awareness on Health Risks Improve Water Quality and Monitoring

What is faecal coliform?

'Increase in faecal concentration'

'High levels of faecal and total coliform at various locations'

'Quality of Ganga water not good for bathing'

'People back from Kumbh experiencing medical issues'

'

Respiratory tract infections

due to crowded settings'

NEW DELHI: Water quality at several locations in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj during the ongoing Maha Kumbh did not meet primary bathing standards due to high faecal coliform levels, a report by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) informed the National Green Tribunal on Monday.According to the CPCB,—a key indicator of sewage contamination—should not exceed the permissible limit of 2,500 units per 100 ml.Faecal coliform bacteria are a group of microorganisms found in the intestines of humans and animals. Their presence in water indicates contamination from sewage or animal waste. While not all coliform bacteria are harmful, their detection raises concerns about the potential presence of dangerous pathogens like viruses, Salmonella, and E. coli.A tribunal panel, headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Prakash Shrivastava and comprising Judicial Member Justice Sudhir Agarwal and Expert Member A Senthil Vel, reviewed measures to prevent sewage discharge into the Ganga and Yamuna rivers in Prayagraj. The bench took note of a CPCB report dated February 3, highlighting certain non-compliances and violations.""The river water quality was not conforming to the primary water quality for bathing with respect to faecal coliform (FC) at all the monitored locations on various occasions. A large number of people bathe in the river at Prayagraj during the Mahakumbh Mela, including on auspicious bathing days, which eventually leads to an increase in faecal concentration,"" the report said.The tribunal noted that UPPCB had not submitted a comprehensive action taken report as previously directed, instead providing only a covering letter with water test results.""Even upon reviewing the documents enclosed with the covering letter dated January 28, 2025, sent by the in-charge of the central laboratory, UPPCB, it is reflected that high levels of faecal and total coliform have been found at various locations,"" it continued.The counsel for Uttar Pradesh received one day to examine and respond to the report. The tribunal instructed the UPPCB Member Secretary and relevant state authority responsible for Ganga water quality at Prayagraj to attend the next virtual hearing scheduled for February 19.Speaking to news agency PTI, Jyotish Peeth Shankaracharya Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati said: ""The National Green Tribunal had highlighted this even before the Kumbh started that the quality of Ganga and Yamuna waters was not good for bathing. They had also issued certain directions, especially on controlling the flow drains into the river. 40-50 crore people are taking bath there, it is being advertised all over the world, but the basic facility of clean water for bathing is not being provided.""While in a separate video, a Senior Consultant in Internal Medicine at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, Delhi, told news agency ANI: ""We are definitely seeing people with medical problems who are coming back from Kumbh, but obviously in a place which has so many people taking a dip in the water. We would expect that this would happen. The number of people who are coming with medical problems is much less as compared to the volume of people that are going over there.""That way, I think the control is very good, but yes, people are definitely coming with something like what we call gastroenteritis , where they're having loose motions, vomiting, and all that. They're having a fever of unspecific or unspecified origin. Most probably, they're viral fevers that are happening,"" the expert warned.The Senior Consultant said that many people returning from Kumbh are experiencing respiratory tract infections which is a common ailment in crowded settings.""Quite a few people are suffering from respiratory tract infections, like a runny nose, sneezing, cough, and cold, which is obviously very common. When you go to such a crowded place, and then you take a dip, which might be at 3 am in the morning, you can get exposed to this cold,"" he continued.He further advised the ""people to carry their own water, maybe water from home or maybe bottles of water, and they should drink water from a good place or carry their own bottles"".""The second thing is to eat food from a healthy place and eat cooked food rather than raw food, wear a mask and try to keep people at a distance...Do not drink the water while taking a dip in the river,"" the doctor added.",Faecal coliform bacteria are a group of microorganisms found in the intestines of humans and animals.

Residents have threatened mass agitation if the plan to ""use the holy water for commercial purposes"" is not withdrawn.It was proposed at the recent meeting of the Special Area Development Authority that a new nature park would be built in Kasol, having 'jacuzzi hot baths', water for which would be brought from Manikaran through a network of pipes.Enraged by the proposal, Manikaran residents met Kullu deputy commissioner Torul S Ravish and sent a memorandum to the CM, demanding scrapping of the plan. ""Manikaran is a site of pilgrimage, and no one should be allowed to misuse the water. If govt wants to build hot baths, then they should do it in Manikaran itself,"" said Narender Kumar, a local. He added that even the deities were against transferring water from Manikaran to Kasol.Opposing the project, local resident Shailender Sharma said, ""Imposition of SADA in Manikaran has led to zero development, and now they want to take away our water... we would not let them do so."" The proposal has also sparked a war of words among local politicians. BJP's Narotam Thakur accused Kullu's Cong MLA Sundar Singh Thakur of having ""vested interest"" in the project. ""It's a bad idea to transfer the holy water of Manikaran, which is a globally famous religious site. Neither the people of Manikaran want the water to be diverted nor the people of Kasol. It's just the local MLA...,"" he added.Last week, former MP Maheshwar Singh had publicly voiced opposition to the proposal, saying that the water from a sacred site like Manikaran should not be used for commercial purposes as ""the holy water of Manikaran is used even by the local deities"". Responding to the allegations, Kullu MLA Sunder Singh Thakur had last week said, ""Whenever we have talked about development, some people in Kullu have opposed it, making religion an excuse. They opposed projects from the ski village to even paragliding in Dhalpur, Kullu.
