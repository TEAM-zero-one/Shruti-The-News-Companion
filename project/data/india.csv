"Jharkhand civil services topper, IRS brother & mom found dead",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jharkhand-civil-services-topper-irs-brother-mom-found-dead/articleshow/118463151.cms,"RANCHI/KOCHI: A Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) exam topper whose career got caught in a protracted legal tangle and a CBI probe into the fairness of the selection process was found dead with her IRS officer brother and their mother in a govt accommodation in Kerala's Kochi on Friday, six days after she failed to appear for a court hearing in Ranchi.Shalini Vijay , assistant director in the Jharkhand social welfare department, was on leave since 2020. She and her brother Manish Vijay, additional commissioner of central excise and customs in Kochi, are suspected to have entered into a suicide pact along with their mother Shakuntala.The matriarch's body was found covered in a white cloth with petals sprinkled all over, leading investigators to presume she died before the siblings purportedly took their lives in separate rooms of Manish's official quarters at Eechamukk in Kochi's Kakkanad neighbourhood.Investigators aren't ruling out the possibility of Shakuntala dying of any natural cause before her son and daughter hanged themselves. ""We will know the details for sure, including the time of death, only after the autopsies,"" said assistant CP (Thrikkakara) P V Baby.Manish's colleagues were the first to find the bodies when they visited the house to check on him as he was supposed to resume work the previous day after a period of leave but was incommunicado.Police found a note in Manish' diary, dated Feb 15, with an instruction to hand over some documents to his younger sister, who is currently in Dubai. The note mentions her phone number. ""She will be arriving soon after the autopsies, which most likely will be done on Saturday,"" a police officer said.Shalini was the topper among 64 civil servants recruited through JPSC's first combined exam in 2003.Some candidates who didn't make the cut challenged the recruitment process soon after, pointing out that many of those who cleared the exam were linked to politicians or officials. As the state probe dragged on, Jharkhand HC had the case transferred to CBI in 2022.CBI filed charges against Shalini and the other recruits under sections 420 (cheating), 423 (fraudulent documentation) and 201 (destruction of evidence) of the IPC, among other offences, along with 13(2) and 13(1)(D) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The next hearing is scheduled for Feb 27.The Vijay family lived in a rented house in Ranchi until 2013. Shalini's mother used to be a college professor in Bokaro.","Shalini vijay was assistant director in the jharkhand social welfare department.

Maha Kumbh 2025: Why authorities are ignoring SOS messages from this Prayagraj wholesale hub,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/maha-kumbh-2025-why-authorities-are-ignoring-sos-messages-from-this-prayagrajs-wholesale-hub/articleshow/118435090.cms,"Prayagraj's wholesale medicine market faces a shutdown amid the Maha Kumbh rush, causing a severe shortage of essential medications

PRAYAGRAJ: With the rush of devotees for Maha Kumbh leading to the 'unofficial' closure of the wholesale medicine market in Prayagraj, the city is facing a severe crisis of medicines, including essential and life-saving drugs. Despite repeated pleas from traders and pharmaceutical suppliers, the authorities have so far ignored the SOS messages, leading to growing concerns among residents and medical professionals, reports Kapil Dixit.Leader Road, which serves as the largest wholesale medicines hub in the city, is situated on the busiest path from Sangam towards the railway station. Due to this, the entry of trucks carrying medical supplies has been strictly prohibited. Since mid-January, the market has struggled to operate efficiently, primarily due to the uninterrupted flow of devotees in the area. As a direct consequence, medicine stocks, particularly for blood pressure, heart diseases, and diabetes, have nearly run out at both wholesale and retail levels, leaving patients and hospitals in distress.Anil Dubey, who heads the Allahabad Chemist and Druggist Association, told TOI, ""Since January 24, traders engaged in the wholesale drug business have not been able to function properly. This has created a massive gap between demand and supply, which is worsening every passing day.""Traders have repeatedly complained that the supply chain has been severely disrupted as trucks carrying medicines are not permitted to enter city limits. ""Association members have made several attempts to convey the severity of the drug shortage to the concerned district authorities, but their appeals have fallen on deaf ears,"" Dubey said. No transporter is willing to book medicine consignments to Leader Road due to the strict enforcement measures imposed by the police and district authorities.Government officials, however, have dismissed the concerns, stating that there has been no official order for the closure of the market.","Prayagraj's wholesale medicine market faces a shutdown amid the maha kumbh rush, causing a severe shortage of essential medications.

BSP's impact despite zero wins

The BSP dilemma: Ally or adversary?

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi reignited political debates by questioning Bahujan Samaj Party ( BSP ) chief Mayawati 's current electoral approach. Addressing Dalit students in Uttar Pradesh, Gandhi asked,Behenji aajkal chunaav theek se kyun nahi lad rahi (Why is Mayawati not fighting polls properly these days)?Reflecting on the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Gandhi revealed that Congress had invited Mayawati to join the INDIA bloc alliance but she declined.If Congress, Samajwadi Party (SP), and BSP had come together, BJP would have lost,"" he asserted.Mayawati responded swiftly, accusing Congress of harboring amalicious and casteist” attitude toward the BSP. She further criticised Congress’s strategy in Delhi, where the party contested alone against both BJP and INDIA bloc ally Aam Aadmi Party, leading to a significant BJP victory .In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh’s first Dalit chief minister, chose to stay neutral by neither joining INDIA bloc not NDA. While the SP-Congress alliance secured 43 out of 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh, the INDIA bloc overall couldn’t unseat the NDA, paving the way for Narendra Modi’s historic third term as Prime Minister.Though BSP failed to win a single seat, its influence on poll outcome in Uttar Pradesh was undeniable. BSP candidates significantly affected INDIA bloc prospects in at least 16 constituencies, including Hardoi, Aligarh, Meerut, Unnao, and Mirzapur. This is on the assumption that all votes that Mayawati's party polled would have been transferred to its alliance partner. If Mayawati had joined hands with Rahul and Akhilesh and assuming her supporters would have backed the INDIA bloc, the opposition coalition could have clinched 59 seats in Uttar Pradesh, cutting the NDA’s tally to 20.On a national scale, this would have raised the INDIA bloc’s count to 250 seats against NDA’s 277 — still short of power but significantly closer.Interestingly, however, BSP’s presence as a neutral player prevented potential losses for the INDIA bloc. Of the 43 seats won by the Congress-SP alliance, there were 31 seats where Mayawati got considerable vote resulting in BJP's defeat. In seats like Azamgarh, Lalganj, Jaunpur, Muzaffarnagar, Kairana, and Saharanpur, INDIA bloc could beat BJP because Mayawati was neutral and polled significant votes. On these seats, if Mayawati was with INDIA bloc, its victory margin over the BJP would have increased.Now let's assume the opposite. If Mayawati had decided to join hands with the NDA, then it would have won all these 31 seats and decimated the INDIA bloc. So while Rahul Gandhi may have been partially correct in critisising Mayawati for not joining INDIA bloc, he should be thankful to the BSF chief for staying neutral and not joining the BJP-led NDA.The BSP secured 9.39 per cent of Uttar Pradesh’s total vote share — just shy of Congress’s 9.46 per cent —yet remained third in nearly all 80 constituencies.This complex electoral math, which is obviously based on the assumption of a complete transfer of votes, highlights the importance of BSP in Uttar Pradesh politics despite its losing sheen over the years. The unpredictable leader that Mayawati is, both NDA and INDIA bloc would be closely watching her next steps.","Congress leader rahul gandhi reignited political debates by questioning bahujan samaj party ( bsp ) chief mayawati's current electoral approach. Gandhi: if congress, samajwadi party (sp), and bsp had come together, bjp would have lost.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde has once again sent a strong message to his political opponents and allies alike, warning them not to underestimate him. Reflecting on his political journey and the 2022 rebellion that reshaped the state’s leadership, Shinde asserted that he is not just any party worker but a disciple of Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray and his mentor Anand Dighe.""I have said this earlier too—those who took me lightly… I am a worker, but a worker of Balasaheb and Dighe Saheb, so everyone should treat me in that way,"" Shinde told reporters. ""When they took me lightly, I overturned the government in 2022 and brought the government of people's choice.""Shinde’s rebellion had led to a vertical split in the Shiv Sena, with a majority of MLAs siding with him, ultimately resulting in the collapse of Uddhav Thackeray’s government. His alliance with BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis secured them a dominant position in the state, a feat he proudly referenced. ""Back then, I had said in my first speech in the Assembly that I and Devendra Fadnavis will win more than 200 seats, and we got 232 seats,"" he said. ""So, 'don't take me lightly'—those who need to understand this signal should understand it.""Meanwhile, at the press conference in Nagpur, Eknath Shinde strongly criticised the Shiv Sena-UBT saying that those leaders who have left Balasaheb Thackeray’s thoughts and those pushing good people out of the party were pushed back by the people in the Assembly elections and made to stay at home forever.""However, Shiv Sena is the one that carries forward the thoughts of Balasaheb Thackeray and Dharmaveer Anand Dighe. Therefore, leaders, office bearers and activists of different parties from across the state are joining Shiv Sena,” he added.On the email threat that he received, the Maharashtra Deputy CM said: ""I am a worker of Balasaheb Thackeray and Anand Dighe. Dance bars were closed when Anand Dighe was there. There were many threats at that time too. When I was the Guardian Minister of Gadchiroli, Maoists gave threats, but the Gadchiroli police did the job of curbing the LWE menace. I am not afraid of threats... I am a person who remains strong.”Meanwhile, Mumbai Police arrested two suspects—Mangesh Achyutrao Wayal (35) and Abhay Gajanan Shingane (22)—from Buldhana in connection with the threat email. Investigations are ongoing to determine the motive behind the threat.",Former chief minister eknath shinde has once again sent a strong message to his political opponents and allies alike.

While some victims have been rescued, the embassy warns that the true scale of the scam is far larger, with many still unaware of the dangers they face.While consular officials are working to evacuate Indian citizens, the embassy has warned that those willingly participating in these scams are not victims but criminals. Indian authorities have urged job-seekers to verify employment offers in Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand before travelling, as those involved in scams may face legal consequences.Myawaddy has become a notorious hub for cyber crime, where workers are coerced into participating in online fraud operations , often under duress. Many of the victims, who have fallen prey to false job promises, are trapped in scam centres with no means of escape, unless they pay large ransoms. With the region controlled by warlords and militia groups, efforts to intervene have been complicated, though Indian consular officials are working to evacuate those who have sought help.Thai authorities, responding to global pressure, have taken action by cutting electricity, internet, and fuel supplies to key areas in Myanmar where these operations are based. In addition, China has urged Thailand to clamp down on the cross-border power supply networks that support these cyber scam syndicates. Despite these measures, the situation remains dire, with many Indian nationals caught in a perilous trap.While at least 150 individuals have been identified as victims, officials suspect the actual number is much higher as many are reportedly working voluntarily without notifying Indian authorities. Sources in ministry of external affairs said efforts are underway to assist those who have sought help.On Feb 18, three Indians managed to escape from a scam centre in Myawaddy and were helped by the embassy to reach Yangon. They are now being processed for repatriation to India. However, officials caution that the lawless nature of Myawaddy complicates large-scale rescue efforts.Since June 2022, over 600 Indians have been rescued from scam operations across Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand.","Nearly 2,000 indians are currently involved in cyber scam operations in myawaddy.

Although Shafiq Ansari has now been proven innocent, he no longer has a house of his own. His home was bulldozed by the administration less than 10 days after the woman filed the complaint in March 2021. ""I had built the house on 4,000sqft of land with my hard-earned savings. Now, there's only rubble. We are staying in my brother's house,"" Ansari (58) told TOI Friday.""We had all the papers. It was alleged that the house was built without permission, but we were not provided a chance to show records or say anything. It was simply torn down. I have a family of seven. They all suffered. I went to jail for three months,"" said Ansari, a former corporator of Sarangpur civic body, around 130km from Bhopal. As per the woman's complaint on March 4, 2021, Ansari called her to his house on Feb 4, 2021, on the pretext of offering help for her son's wedding but raped her.Ansari's house was demolished on March 13, 2021. ""They came at 7am. The administration arrived with bulldozers, and before my family members could understand anything, my house was in ruins. I was absconding at that time. I surrendered the next day,"" Ansari said.The verdict came on Feb 14 this year. First additional sessions ju dge of Rajgarh district, Chitrendra Singh Solanki, noted ""significant inconsistencies"" in the testimonies of the woman and her husband. The court observed that although there is a police station close to her house, which was demolished, she did not report the alleged rape immediately. For 15 days after her son's wedding, she neither informed her husband or any of her sons about the alleged crime, and no reason was given for this delay, the court noted. No human sperm was found on samples of the complainant, the order said, concluding that rape could not be confirmed from clinical and scientific evidence.Ansari plans to move court seeking justice for the demolition of his house.","Shafiq ansari's home was bulldozed by the administration less than 10 days after the woman filed the complaint in march 2021.

In its latest order on Feb 19, CAT bench of Justices Oberoi and Anand directed the registry not to list his cases any further without providing specific reasoning. Chaturvedi's counsel, Sudershan Goel, said the case pertained to his appraisal report.In Feb 2024, an Uttarakhand HC judge had recused from hearing Chaturvedi's deputation case.

CUDDALORE: Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin upped the ante on Friday in his run-in with the Modi govt over National Education Policy and devolution of funds, saying it would take DMK ""just one second to say we won't pay tax that Union govt is collecting from the state,"" reports Bosco Dominique. ""Federalism is about give-and-take,"" Stalin said here.Referring to Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan's statement that TN stood to lose Rs 5,000 crore for not rolling out PM Shri scheme linked to NEP, Stalin said Centre was jealous of states' growth and was trying to impede their development.Accusing the Centre of not giving states their rightful share of resources, Stalin said: “After sucking out all state taxes through the GST regime, the Union govt is refusing to disburse the dues of states. They are refusing to announce new schemes or release funds even for joint projects of the state and Union govts.”Stalin warned: “Don’t hurl stones at a beehive. Don’t provoke the unique spirit of Tamil people. Don’t seek to witness resurgence of Tamil defiance. As long as I am here, as long as DMK is here, no anti-Tamil, anti-Tamil Nadu, or anti-Tamilian agenda will succeed.”Pradhan countered Stalin’s opposition to NEP, saying TN’s stance was politically motivated and harmful to students. He shared a letter addressed to Stalin on his X handle, mentioning that it was “highly inappropriate” for a state to oppose NEP with a “narrow-minded approach”. Pradhan accused the TN govt of using “intimidation for political reasons”. He said the Modi govt was fully committed to promoting Tamil culture globally and urged TN to “not politicise education” and instead work “beyond political differences in the best interest of our students”. Pradhan argued NE was a transformative policy aimed at modernising India’s education system while preserving linguistic and cultural diversity. Rejecting allegations of Hindi being imposed on southern states, he said, “Let me unequivocally state there is no question of imposing any language on any state or community.” Stalin told the gathering in Cuddalore that the “real disaster for India” was the Union govt’s alleged failure to understand the fundamental principle of federalism. “NEP is not designed to promote education but to advance the agenda of making India a homogenous nation,” he said.","Stalin says it would take dmk ""just one second to say we won't pay tax that union govt is collecting from the state"" ""federalism is about give-and-take,"" stalin said here.
