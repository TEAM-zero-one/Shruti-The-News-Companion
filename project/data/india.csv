Whenunveiled the reconstructed faces of Keeladi men who lived 2,500 years ago, it felt like a moment of time travel. The skulls excavated from Keeladi had been carefully studied and brought to life by researchers from the UK. Their eyes, jawlines, and foreheads appeared deeply familiar — like gazing into a mirror that stretched across millennia.From the artefacts recovered — carbon dated to 600 BCE — names that echo through Sangam literature emerge;and. It is thrilling to see the torches of archaeology and ancient poetry illuminating the same path through our shared past.Reading theis no less than an archaeological dig. With each couplet, we brush away the dust of time and catch glimpses of a civilization that once breathed on the same soil. Valluvar may not have held a chisel, but his pen was as precise.Homes were called(Kural 340). The inner courtyard — today’s living space — was(Kural 720). Doors were bolted (Kural 1251). People drew drinking water from(Kural 215). Women bracelets called(Kural-1101), and heavy studs in their ears referred to as(Kural 1081). In one unforgettable image, Valluvar paints a picture of a woman marking each day her husband is away, scratching lines on the wall to keep count (Kural 1261). Love was not a fleeting romance — it was record-keeping.Occupations of the time unfold too — farmers, weavers, palanquin bearers, carpenters, hunters, soldiers, barbers, potters, religious pundits, and goldsmiths. Agriculture was not just a profession, it was revered. Crops like sugarcane (Kural 1078), sesame (Kural 889), and millets (Kural 104) were grown with care. Farmers drew from wells (Kural 396) and spring waters (Kural 1161). “If the farmer tills properly,” Valluvar wrote in Kural 1037, “no manure is needed.” A principle that would echo well with modern soil scientists’ warning against nutrient run-off and pollution.A few months ago, I was running late and requested my daughter to heat the sambar I had made. When I returned, I saw her using the vessel meant for boiling milk. I snapped. “You’re using the milk vessel for sambar?”She looked baffled. “What’s wrong with that?”I explained: “Milk vessels are always kept separate. The ladle too. If you use them for other foods, the next time you boil milk, it may curdle.”She looked at me suspiciously. “Is this a new house rule?”“It’s a rule, yes,” I said, switching off the stove and quickly transferring the sambar. “But it’s not new. It’s been followed in households like ours for over 2,000 years.She raised an eyebrow. “Because there’s evidence — not archaeological, but literary,” I said. In, Valluvar uses the metaphor of pure milk turning bad because of an unclean vessel to speak of wealth in the hands of the undeserving. Valluvar even uses the termfor vessels exclusively used only for milk.”She paused, then said, “Sometimes you are proud because you started something new. But sometimes you're proud because you are part of a continuum — something that’s been going on for centuries.”I couldn’t agree more. That’s exactly why the images from Keeladi gave me goosebumps. It was a proud, humbling reminder: We are not the beginning of anything. We are a single link in a chain forged long before us—and if we are mindful, a link that will hold firm for generations to come.","Thirukkural with the times explores real-world lessons from the classic tamil text.

Speaking at the rally, Raj also said he was not opposed to any language, but would not tolerate compulsion.Raj warned the traders who had protested by holding a rally against the assault on a Mira Road shop-keeper by MNS activists that “there are Marathi traders as well and if we don’t buy from you, then what will you sell?”","Mns chief raj thackeray said if hindi was made mandatory for classes 1 to 5 in schools in maharashtra, his party will ‘shut down schools’ he referred to cm devendra fadnavis’s latest reported statement that the three-language policy will be implemented.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122774185,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-15346,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

TMC anti-development: PM in Bengal

PM launches projects worth Rs 7,200 cr in poll-bound Bihar

(With inputs from Madan Kumar in Patna)

KOLKATA: PM Modi’s second rally in seven weeks in West Bengal, in the industrial township of Durgapur Friday, started with a “Jai Ma Kali, Jai Ma Durga” homage to the state’s two biggest Hindu deities. He then took Trinamool’s campaign for the 2026 assembly polls head-on, vowing that “infiltrators will be investigated as per provisions in the legal system”.“We will not allow a conspiracy against Bengal’s ‘asmita’ (pride). It is Modi’s guarantee,” he said to a cheering crowd. “For the sake of vote-bank politics, TMC is putting Bengal’s identity at stake by encouraging and protecting illegal immigrants and that has become a threat to national security as well. An ecosystem has been created to support infiltrators,” Modi claimed, dovetailing barbs against Mamata Banerjee’s “appeasement politics” with a new focus on “Bengali pride”.Other BJP politicians, like former MP Locket Chatterjee and assembly opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari started with the customary “Jai Sri Ram” slogan but the PM’s eschewing of Ram and his focus on Bengal’s deities and past political, cultural and industrial icons (like Bidhan Chandra Roy, Syama Prasad Mookerjee, Kadambini Ganguly, Dwarkanath Tagore and Bishnu Dey) gave a glimpse of BJP’s strategy in the run-up to the 2026 assembly poll: stress BJP’s connect with Bengal to offset TMC’s hammer-andtongs campaign against “the harassment and torture of Bengalis in BJP-ruled states”.Modi also brought up “classical language status” for Bengali, taking credit for “a BJP initiative”, while accusing Trinamool and Left Front of never caring for the language. Trinamool was “anti-development”, Modi said, attributing the flight of Bengal’s youth to other states to that. “People across the country used to come here for employment.The trend has changed now. Existing industries are closing down. We have to pull Bengal out of this situation,” he said. The PM wove this narrative with BJP’s usual anti-Trinamool litany as he blamed its use of “syndicate raj, gunda tax and mafia control” for driving out industries. “It formulates policies encouraging corruption.Which industrialist will dare to come to a state where there are riots,” the Prime Minister asked.Meanwhile, in Patna, PM laid foundation stones, inaugurated and dedicated to the nation multiple development projects worth over Rs 7,200 crore before addressing a public meeting during his Motihari programme.","Pm modi’s second rally in seven weeks in west bengal, in the industrial township of durgapur friday. “we will not allow a conspiracy against bengal's ‘asmita’ (pride).

NEW DELHI: A day after Devendra Fadnavis , in a light-hearted comment, invited Uddhav Thackeray to ""come to the ruling side,"" the Shiv Sena UBT chief met the Maharashtra chief minister on Thursday.According to the ANI, the meeting between Fadnavis and Thackeray took place in the office of Legislative Council Chairman Ram Shinde. Their meeting lasted about 20 minutes.On Wednesday, Fadnavis said that Thackeray ""can come to the ruling side in a different way."" While addressing the Maharashtra assembly, the CM said that till 2029, there is no scope for the BJP to come to the opposition side.""At least till 2029, there is no scope for us to come there (opposition). Uddhav Ji can think about the scope of coming to this side (ruling party) and that can be thought about in a different way, but there is absolutely no scope left for us to come there (opposition),"" Fadnavis said.The Shiv Sena and BJP's alliance bloomed till 2014. But, their 25-year partnership hit a rough patch during the 2014 Maharashtra Assembly elections due to a seat-sharing dispute. And finally in 2019, after winning the election, Uddhav ditched BJP and joined hands with Congress.However, Fadnavis had his revenge two and a half years later when Eknath Shinde revolted against Uddhav and split the Shiv Sena. Since then, Fadnavis has been with the Shinde Sena.Eknath Shinde, who served as chief minister for over two years after the 2022 coup, was reluctant to hand over the reins back to Fadnavis in 2024 after their alliance got an overwhelming mandate from the people of the state.Also Read: Can come to the ruling side': Fadnavis offers Uddhav Thackeray, says BJP not going to be in opposition 'at least till 2029 Fadnavis's statement came at a time when Uddhav Thackeray has intensified his attacks on the BJP and the Shinde-led government over the three-language policy, and when speculation about a patch-up between the estranged Thackeray cousins is gaining traction.Speculation has been mounting over the possible collaboration between UBT and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), especially after July 5, when Raj and Uddhav Thackeray shared a stage for the first time in two decades.T he rare show of unity came during a joint celebration of the Maharashtra government's decision to reverse two controversial orders mandating Hindi as a third language from Class 1 in state schools.Back in April, Raj Thackeray had already fuelled talk of a possible thaw, calling their past disagreements “trivial” and stressing that uniting for the cause of the Marathi manoos shouldn’t be difficult. Uddhav Thackeray echoed a similar tone shortly after, saying he was open to reconciliation—so long as it didn’t include those acting against Maharashtra’s interests.","Devendra fadnavis invited uddhav thackeray to ""come to the ruling side"" the shiv sena ubt chief met the maharashtra chief minister on thursday.

KOCHI: Bitra Island, one of the 10 inhabited isles in the Lakshadweep archipelago, is set to be taken over by govt for defence purposes. There are 105 families on the island and many have opposed the move.Lakshadweep revenue department has issued a notification, dated July 11, for a social impact assessment (SIA). It stated that the intention was to transfer the entire island to defence and strategic agencies considering its “strategic location” and “national security relevance”.L akshadweep MP Hamdullah Sayeed alleged that the move was aimed at disrupting peace in the area and would be opposed tooth and nail.Lakshadweep MP vows to fight for Bitra islandersIn a video message, Lakshadweep MP Hamdullah Syeed asked Bitra natives not to worry or be anxious about the notification.“As your MP, we held a confer- ence that included leaders from Bitra and Lakshad- weep and discussed it in de- tail. We have decided to fight with the people of Bitra, po- litically and legally,” he said.Sayeed said govt had already acquired land required for defence purposes on several islands.Targeting Bitra, which has had an indigenous population for decades, without considering any alternative, is unacceptable. He also criticised the administration for not holding any consultation with the islanders.The notification said that a Social Impact Assessment (SIA) was needed as per pro- visions of the Right to Fair Compensation and Trans- parency in Land Acquisi- tion, Rehabilitation and Re- settlement Act, 2013. Naming the department of revenue as project developer, it said SIA activities included con- sultations with all stake- holders of the proposed ar- ea, including gram sabha.“The SIA and Consent Society, UT of Lakshad- weep, will complete the sur- vey of the proposed area un- der acquisition within two months from the date of the notification,” it said, adding that consent of gram sabhas and/or landowners was not mandatory.","Lakshadweep revenue department has issued a notification, dated july 11, for a social impact assessment (sia) it stated that the intention was to transfer the entire island to defence and strategic agencies considering its ‘strategic location’ and ‘national security relevance’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122772958,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-2953706,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Set up NIA courts or will give accused bail, SC warns govt

NEW DELHI: With long delay in trials in hundreds of NIA investigated cases relating to terrorism and heinous crimes, Supreme Court on Friday said designating existing courts as special NIA courts was unacceptable and gave an ultimatum to the Union and Maharashtra govts to set up new, exclusive special courts for trial in these cases by Sept.“You cannot designate existing courts, which are dealing with civil and criminal cases, to put an additional burden of NIA cases on them. If you want to expedite trial in NIA-investigated cases having national ramification, you must establish new courts, appoint senior judicial officers, provide them with staff and adequate infrastructure,” SC said.Senior advocate Trideep Pais argued that his client Kailash Ramchandani was arrested by NIA in a UAPA case and was lodged in jail for the last six years without trial as the judicial officer, manning the special court, had no time to proceed with the case.The bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi told additional solicitor general Rajkumar B Thakre that this was the last opportunity for Union and Maharashtra govts to set up new special courts to exclusively deal with NIA cases. The bench said if such steps were not taken, then courts would be constrained to consider grant of bail to the accused in these cases on the ground of delay in trial.Rejecting NIA’s affidavit which claimed compliance with Supreme Court’s order for establishment of special courts by designating existing courts, the bench said no effective or visible step was taken by the authorities.In its last order, the Justice Kant-led bench had said, “There are hundreds of trials in different parts of the country under special statutes like UAPA, Indian Explosives Act, MCOCA and other similar statutes in different states. However, trials are not commencing because presiding officers are also occupied with several other criminal and civil cases. In the absence of a judicial audit of the matters, which are actually or likely to be generated with the enactment of a new law, trials pertaining to heinous offences have brought an enormous burden on the existing system. ”It had further said, “The most effective recourse can be the establishment of dedicated courts to whom trials under special statutes can be entrusted, without giving them any other civil or criminal cases. Ideally, the trial should take place on a day-to-day basis.”","Supreme court gives ultimatum to union and maharashtra govts to set up new, exclusive special courts for trial in these cases by sept. “you cannot designate existing courts, which are dealing with civil and criminal cases, to put an additional burden of nia cases on them.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122772880,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-36700,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Digital arrest is economic terrorism: Spl prosecutor

KOLKATA: In possibly the first such sentencing in the country for cybercrimes, a trial court in Kalyani, in Bengal’s Nadia district, Friday awarded life imprisonment to nine scammers who had extorted Rs 1 crore from a Ranaghat resident by threatening him with ‘digital arrest’ last year, reports Dwaipayan Ghosh. It agreed with the prosecution’s charge that such crimes were nothing short of “economic terrorism”.Arrested from Maharashtra, Haryana and Gujarat, the nine convicts, including a woman, were part of a larger gang that has allegedly amassed Rs 100 crore by cheating 108 people across India. They are also likely to face trials elsewhere in the country.Kalyani additional sessions judge Suberthi Sarkar, who had convicted the nine on Thursday, sentenced them to life imprisonment under BNS 338, which involves forging of documents, and 10 other penal offences under both BNS and Information Technology Acts.The defence indicated they would appeal against the conviction in the HC. IGP (CID) Akhilesh Chaturvedi said the nine cybercriminals were tripped by strong digital evidence.“Probe revealed the fraudsters were siphoning money through multiple bank accounts spread across different states. Police seized numerous passbooks, ATM cards, SIM cards and mobile phones during the operation.A detailed analysis of beneficiary accounts and phone numbers led us to uncover this sophisticated network,” the IGP said.During the five-month trial, 29 witnesses from four different states testified physically before the judge. They included SHO of Andheri (West) PS and branch managers of SBI, PNB, Canara Bank, Bandhan Bank, Federal Bank, and Ujjivan Small Finance Bank, from four states. The chargesheet ran into 2,600 pages. Special prosecutor Bivas Chatterjee said they highlighted the ordeal of other victims of the gang and stressed that such frauds amounted to economic terrorism.“We told the judge how hard-earned money of two victims — one a retired professor and the other a retired state govt engineer — had been transferred outside the country. This was their life’s entire savings,” he told TOI.","The nine convicts, including a woman, were part of a larger gang that has allegedly amassed rs 100 crore by cheating 108 people across india.

NEW DELHI: Is Chirag Paswan setting the stage for Round 2 of his ""targeted"" tussle with Nitish Kumar ahead of assembly elections? In the 2020 assembly elections, Chirag played a key role in making Nitish Kumar's JD(U) the junior partner of the BJP in the ruling NDA.Five years later, as the election approaches, he is back to targeting the Bihar chief minister, this time over the deteriorating law and order situation in the backdrop of several high-profile murders in the state.Here's a look at some of the statements Chirag has made targeting his own government in the poll-bound state over law and order:Clearly, a no-holds-barred attack on the Bihar police, which functions under the direct watch of CM Nitish Kumar, as he also holds the home portfolio.The LJP chief's attack is completely justified given the recent murder incidents -- first the killing of a prominent businessman Gopal Khemka, who was shot outside his residence in Patna by a bike-borne assailant in broad daylight and then the killing of a convict in a hospital by four assailants, caught on CCTV.But the only catch is: Chirag Paswan is part of the NDA -- which includes the BJP and has ruled Bihar for most of the last 20 years.The present Nitish government has two deputy chief ministers from the BJP.So, who is Chirag targeting? The NDA government in the state, or only chief minister Nitish Kumar, with whom he shares a bitter, uneasy relationship? Well, the LJP (RV) chief is certainly not attacking the BJP, as his latest tweet on deteriorating law and order in Bihar was hours after he had held a meeting with BJP chief J P Nadda.In 2020, when Chirag had walked out of the NDA ahead of the assembly elections over seat sharing, he had kept his ties with the BJP while targeting Nitish Kumar. He had then strategically fielded candidates to divide the NDA votes and ensure the defeat of JD(U) candidates in several assembly seats.Chirag Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) contested 137 seats in 2020, but mostly in constituencies where Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) was fighting and not the BJP. JD(U)’s seat count fell from 71 in 2015 to 43 in 2020. The party lost 72 seats of the total 115 it contested. In 27 of these, the LJP's vote share exceeded the margin of defeat. In 64 seats where the party failed to win, LJP’s vote tally exceeded the margin of victory, effectively altering the final outcome.This time around, Chirag is a Union minister and very much a part of the NDA at the Centre, but he is still playing the guessing game. While announcing his decision to contest elections, he slammed the lack of development in the state till now and announced that he is contesting elections to improve the condition of the people of Bihar. Interestingly, this is also what the opposition parties claim.Chirag had earlier announced that he would be contesting elections on all 243 seats to ensure that the NDA wins and forms a government again. Now, here is a catch. Perhaps, Chirag, whose party has no members in the state assembly at present, is preparing the ground to ensure that his party gets a good number of seats to contest. But that may be difficult as the JD(U) considers itself a key player and is unlikely to give up its claims despite the party's poor show in 2020.So, if Chirag is not satisfied with seat sharing, he may yet again, with perhaps tacit approval of the BJP, decide to contest alone even while continuing to be a part of the NDA at the Centre. His aim possibly would be to ensure again that the BJP does not suffer electorally while Nitish bears the brunt.If that indeed happens, Nitish will be left in the lurch. Already battling negative reports around his health, Nitish, who has dominated politics in Bihar for the last 20 years, faces one of the most challenging elections. He has already sworn again and again that he will make no more flip-flops, something that gave him the dubious distinction of being called the ""Paltu Ram"".CM Nitish is likely to be wary of Chirag's plans. The Bihar chief minister knows that if his party's tally plunges further, it will be the end of the road for him, especially when it comes to leading the NDA in the state. And the mantle would naturally pass on to the BJP.","Is chirag paswan setting the stage for round 2 of his ""targeted"" tussle with nitish kumar ahead of assembly elections? In the 2020 assembly elections, he played a key role in making nitish's jd(u) the junior partner of the bjp in the ruling nda.

NEW DELHI: A new development came in the Balashore self-immolation case, where the victim's friend on Friday claimed that the HoD threatened to fail her if she didn't fulfil his demands and accused the principal of provoking her to reach such an extent that she killed herself.The victim, a 20-year-old second-year B.Ed student at Fakir Mohan (Autonomous) College, Balasore, died after setting herself ablaze on July 12 outside the college gate during a peaceful protest that had been ongoing since July 1, demanding action against the head of the education department.The B.Ed student's friend Koshish Das also said that the HoD has been doing this for six months with her.""All of this was going on with her for six months...

PATNA: The shooters involved in Thursday’s murder of gangster and murder convict Chandan Mishra in a Patna hospital while the 36-year-old was on parole were still at large even 24 hours after the brazen crime.Bihar police announced that they had identified all five shooters, including the main gunman Tausif Badshah, a resident of Patna’s Phulwarisharif well aware of Paras Hospital and acquainted with its security guards. While the shooters have been marked out from hospital CCTV footage and preliminary probes, their locations have not been traced yet, police said.Police said the murder appeared to have been orchestrated by Onkarnath alias Sheru Singh, a friend-turned-foe of Chandan currently serving life term for murder at Purulia jail in Bengal. “Sheru suspected Chandan had been informing the police about his members. Several of his associates were killed in the recent past,” a police officer said.Patna SSP Kartikeya K Sharma identified two other shooters as Monu Singh and Balwant Singh of Buxar -- Chandan’s home district. “The remaining two are also from Buxar but their names cannot be revealed now as it could affect the probe. Sheru seems to have orchestrated the entire conspiracy from Purulia jail,” the SSP said.Raids were conducted across Buxar on Friday. A suspicious SUV was stopped and three people detained but the cops could not find any evidence against them.","24 hours on, shooters of bihar gangster still at large.

NEW DELHI: South Asian University (SAU) has expelled a Bangladeshi doctoral scholar and fined the students’ mess secretary Rs 5,000 for their role in a clash over the serving of non-vegetarian food on Maha Shivratri earlier this year. The disciplinary action follows an internal inquiry by the university’s Proctorial Committee.The February 26 incident saw an altercation in the university mess between two student groups after fish curry was served on the Hindu festival. According to students, members affiliated with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad had earlier requested that only vegetarian food be provided on Maha Shivratri as many were observing fasts. When fish curry appeared on the menu, ABVP members allegedly attempted to remove it from the serving counter, leading to a heated exchange and physical scuffle. A female member of the mess committee was allegedly manhandled during the confrontation.The Students’ Federation of India (SFI) accused ABVP members of trying to impose their dietary preferences on others and termed the incident an attack on secular values.ABVP, however, said the serving of non-vegetarian food on a fasting day was “insensitive” and disrupted religious harmony. Police received a PCR call about the ruckus, but officers found no active clash on arrival and no formal complaint was filed, leaving the university to handle the matter internally.After weeks of deliberation, the university found doctoral scholar Sudipto Das guilty of “serious misconduct” and ordered his immediate expulsion, citing repeated instances of indiscipline. He has been permanently barred from reapplying to any SAU programme and instructed to vacate his hostel within 24 hours. The university also noted that Das had previously been warned over a suspension in 2022 for similar disruptive behaviour. Mess secretary Yashada Sawant, while not directly involved in the confrontation, was held responsible for failing to maintain order in the mess and was fined Rs 5,000.The office order, issued on July 15, stated that the disciplinary action was taken with the approval of the competent authority.",South asian university (sau) has expelled a bangladeshi doctoral scholar and fined the students’ mess secretary.

‘Use of derogatory terms go against SC guidelines’

NEW DELHI: A father’s fight for the dignity of his daughter, who has 65% intellectual disability, which made the court of the chief commissioner for persons with disabilities (CCPD) issue directives to remedy the situation, has led to the Indian Railways replacing the use of “mental retardation” with “intellectual disability” on railway concession certificates.A disability rights advocate, Pankaj Maru had failed to get a response from railways regarding the terminology used in the concession certificate issued to his daughter, Sonu (26). On July 12 last year, he filed a complaint with court of CCPD regarding the description of his daughter’s disability —This (the terminology issue) was despite Pankaj Maru submitting the unique disability ID card of his daughter along with the application, wherein her disability was described as intellectual disability, in keeping with provisions of Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016.In its final order Thursday, CCPD said the Railway Board had informed court on July 14 that an instruction dated May 9has been issued stating ministry of railways has decided to replace the term “mentally retarded persons” with “persons with intellectual disability”.The change has been implemented from June 1. CCPD emphasised the criticality of language in ensuring dignity of people with disabilities. While noting that the board had already issued a circular in 2018 whereby words such as “blind”, “deaf and dumb” and “physically challenged” were replaced with terms prescribed in RPwD Act, the court has recommended that railways should review their existing forms and all other documents to determine if similar corrections are required to be made and to ensure that the existing stationery is not used for any certification in future.CCPD cited the concern raised by Maru in his complaint that outdated and derogatory terms like “handicapped” still appear in preprinted concession certificate format, which goes against SC’s guidelines on respectful disability terminology. CCPD has sought an action-taken report within three months and also asked railways to sensitise its staff on types and sub-types of disabilities.In its observations in the case in Feb, CCPD had countered railways’ interpretation of legal provisions as reason for continuing with the use of “mental retardation” in concession forms.It noted that the “Railway Board’s contention that intellectual disability and mental behaviour have been separately defined in the Schedule to RPwD Act, 2016 is correct, but their averment that ‘retardation’ is defined under ‘mental behaviour’ is not. In fact, the definition of ‘mental behaviour’ in the schedule of the law explicitly excludes “retardation’.”","Pankaj maru had failed to get a response from railways regarding the terminology used in the concession certificate issued to his daughter, sonu (26) he filed a complaint with court of ccpd regarding the description of his daughter’s disability.

The agency began the money laundering probe based on an FIR filed by Uttarakhand Police over irregularities in land registered for the trust running the educational institute.ED alleged that despite a court order, Sushila Rani and others registered two power of attorneys for lands in Sahaspur. These plots were later sold by attorney holder Kandari to Deepti Rawat and Rana at prices far below circle rates. “The lands purchased by Deepti Rawat are now part of Doon Institute of Medical Sciences (under the trust) controlled by family of Harak Singh,” ED said.","Ed files chargesheet against harak singh rawat in money laundering case.

Bid to suppress debate on tree-felling: Congress

RAIPUR: Enforcement Directorate arrested on Friday Chaitanya Baghel, son of former Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel, from his residence in Bhilai after the agency conducted an early morning search at his premises in connection with an alleged Rs 2,100 crore liquor scam during his father’s tenure as CM.Chaitanya was presented at a special PMLA court in Raipur which sent him to five-day ED custody, an agency official said, adding that Chaitanya did not cooperate during the searches. The father-son duo stays in the same house, while Baghel also has an MLA residence in Raipur. When ED carried out searches, Baghel was at his Raipur residence and was proceeding to Vidhan Sabha.The timing of the raid, on the last day of the assembly session, triggered sharp political reactions, particularly from the opposition Congress.ED’s early-morning raid and the subsequent arrest of former Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel’s son Chaitanya set off sharp reactions, with Congress alleging that the move was designed to suppress discussion on deforestation in Tamnar region of Raigarh district linked to a particular industrialist.ED had earlier searched Chaitanya Baghel’s premises on March 10 while probing some transactions allegedly linking him and his entities to “proceeds of crime” in the liquor “scam” case.The agency did not disclose details of the charges against Chaitanya, but in an earlier press note, it had claimed that some senior bureaucrat, having protection of “top executive of the state”, carried out the scam.Reacting to the arrest, Baghel Senior said the Centre was misusing its agencies to target opposition netas. “To please their master PM Modi and Amit Shah, they have sent ED to my house. We won’t be scared or bow down,” he said. He, however, said he would cooperate with the probe.In this case, ED had in Jan arrested former excise minister Kawasi Lakhma; Anwar Dhebar, brother of Raipur mayor and Congress’s Aijaz Dhebar; and senior babus, including IAS officer Anil Tuteja and a telecom service officer, Arunpati Tripathi.After the arrest of Lakhma, ED had claimed that he was “aware of the complete affairs of the liquor scam, yet he did nothing to stop it”. The agency has accused Lakhma of receiving Rs 2 crore every month from the syndicate involved in illegal liquor trade.ED had also said Lakhma played an important role in policy change, which led to the introduction of FL-10A licence in Chhattisgarh. “He was an integral part of the syndicate and assisted it by manoeuvring the process and procedures as per their direction,” it said. The agency has so far attached assets worth over Rs 200 crore in the case.Baghel later said, “The adjournment motion moved by Congress in the Chhattisgarh assembly over tree felling being carried out by Adani Group in Tamnar was disallowed by Speaker Raman Singh. The opposition alleged that there has been no adherence to the PESA Act, no compliance with directives issued by the National Green Tribunal, and even the resolution unanimously passed by the state assembly has been disregarded. Not even a discussion was permitted.”Bringing an adjournment motion in the assembly, leader of the opposition Charandas Mahant and Baghel alleged in their speeches that “Tamnar coal mine, which has been allotted to Maharashtra State Power Generation Company with its mine operator and developer being Adani, is being run solely for the benefit of a single industrialist, while local residents are being harassed and displaced”.","Chaitanya baghel is the son of former chhattisgarh cm bhupesh baghel.

Varma questions validity of in-house procedure that allows CJI to recommend removal of judge

Cong MPs to sign motion in LS against Justice Varma

NEW DELHI: Ahead of a possible removal motion in Parliament’s monsoon session, Justice Yashwant Varma moved Supreme Court for quashing of an in-house inquiry report holding him guilty for the huge illicit cash at his official residence in Delhi and challenged the constitutionality of then CJI Sanjiv Khanna’s recommendation to the Centre to strip him of HC judgeship.Justice Varma, whose defence team is led by senior advocates including Kapil Sibal, filed the petition faulting the process adopted by the three-member panel to inquire into the cash allegedly found at his bungalow, terming the panel’s conclusions about his guilt as mere surmises without evidence.Interestingly, the day saw a PIL being filed in the SC by advocate Mathews Nedumpara seeking registration of an FIR for the unaccounted cash that was discovered within the premises of the judge’s official residence by first responders who reached after a fire on the night of March 14. Many former judges of Delhi HC shared the view of the PIL petitioner and said only a thorough investigation by a probe agency could unravel the money trail.In the writ petition filed through advocate Vaibhav Niti, Justice Varma asked why Delhi Police and Delhi Fire Service personnel, who discovered the cash, did not seize it or prepare a ‘panchnama’, which alone could have been admissible evidence. He accused then CJI Khanna of subjecting him to a media trial by uploading unsubstantiated material against him on the SC’s official website.Repatriated to Allahabad HC during the inquiry, the judge said the panel’s report was handed over to him on May 4 and the then CJI “advised him to resign or seek voluntary retirement by 7pm on May 6, failing which the CJI would ‘intimate competent authority to initiate action for his removal’”.The judge, who had been barred from judicial work, said he was denied a personal hearing he had sought, as per the in-house procedure, before the CJI and senior SC judges, prior to the CJI sending the recommendation to the President and the PM on May 8, just five days before CJI Khanna retired.He requested that SC declare the CJI’s recommendation unconstitutional and ultra vires. He also questioned the constitutional validity of the in-house procedure that empowered the CJI to recommend removal of a constitutional court judge.This in-house process “creates a parallel, extra-constitutional mechanism that derogates from the mandatory framework under Articles 124 and 218 of the Constitution, which exclusively vest powers for removal of judges of high courts in Parliament through an address supported by a special majority, following an inquiry under the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968”, he said.Justice Varma said power to remove constitutional court judges was given to Parliament by the Constitution after conducting a thorough trial of the charges against a judge with in-built safeguards including framing of charges, cross-examination, and proof beyond reasonable doubt for ‘proven misbehaviour’.Thus, the in-house procedure, as far as it usurps parliamentary procedure to recommend removal of judges, violates the doctrine of separation of powers. Judiciary cannot assume the role reserved for the legislature in the removal of judges, Justice Varma said.He said the Constitution conferred no disciplinary or superintendence power with the CJI over HC or SC judges. Thus, the CJI cannot assume, through in-house procedure, an unregulated authority to act as the arbiter of the fate of HC and SC judges, he said.Justice Varma’s challenge mirrors the line Sibal took on his YouTube show last week to dissect the inquiry report with panellists: former SC judges Justices Madan Lokur and Sanjay Kaul and ex-Delhi HC judge Justice Mukta Gupta. In the show, Sibal argued that the in-house inquiry was not consistent with constitutional provisions.Congress MPs will sign the motion that govt will bring in Lok Sabha against Justice Yashwant Varma, with the party saying it will be done to set up a 3-member statutory panel which is required under Judges Inquiry Act before a judge’s removal. Party general secretary Jairam Ramesh said opposition will also push govt to move on the motion to remove against Allahabad HC judge Shekhar Yadav, who is accused of making “hate speech”.Ramesh slammed non-registration of an FIR against Varma, saying the entire process has been based on a report of the in-house panel of SC. He said Justice Yadav violated his oath with his speech but the notice to remove him is pending with Rajya Sabha chairman for past seven months.",Varma questions validity of in-house procedure that allows cji to recommend removal of judge.
