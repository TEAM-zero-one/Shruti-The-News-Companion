Compared to the compassionate, the wicked are “fortunate” —

They carry no weight of remorse in their hearts.

It was not the crime that first unsettled me — it was the nail polish on her fingers.Neat, with a kind of professional perfection.But here was Abirami — standing trial for killing her two young children — with the composure of someone on a casual outing, not a courtroom that might condemn her for life .Seven years ago, when the case broke, my thoughts went first to her children. Even if they saw their mother adding something to their milk, they would have drunk it. Why would a child suspect their mother of harming them?The court found her and her lover guilty of murder. Yet the case felt like more like a warning than a domestic tragedy — of how the lure of illicit relationships and fantasy, amplified by platforms like TikTok (not banned when the crime happened), can erode moral fibres already tattering. For Abirami, elopement wasn’t enough — she wanted to erase every tie that bound her to her existing life. So, she poisoned her children.In nature, some animals kill their young — to spare the weak, to conserve resources. But evolution attunes most species toward nurturing, not destruction. Monkeys — our closest kin — do not practise infanticide. Which makes maternal filicide in humans not just rare, but chilling.Psychologists trace its motives thus:: a suicidal mother saves her child from a motherless life: driven by hallucinations or delusions: the child is killed to take revenge on the father: the child is an obstacleAbirami’s motive lay in the coldest category — the child as hindrance.On the day of verdict, the judge pronounced the sentence – life imprisonment for both. That image stayed with me — the woman waiting for judgement — her hair neatly tied, her face composed. No tremor of guilt . No eyes hollowed by remorse . She cried only when the punishment was pronounced. She asked for mercy — which she never showed her children.Mothers are considered protectors, who don’t eat, sleep or even comb their hair for weeks if their child is unwell. Think of Manisha Kachhadiya, who in the recent Air India IC171 crash in Ahmedabad, shielded her eight‑month‑old son from the flames with her own body, later donating her skin to save him, again. Her instincts were pure, reflexive — child before self.Abirami stood at the opposite pole. Evil isn’t effortless. Yet some do it — and live on, as though nothing happened.Perhaps they have what psychologists call— two selves coexisting:One, the rational self that walks, talks, and performs the social dance.The other, hidden and dark, driven by lust, desire, hatred, or greed.The mind capable of such cruelty is not always broken; sometimes it is calculating — able to measure gestures of grace with the same precision it measures out poison. It can hold two worlds within itself: one that functions in the day, of socialisation, and another that thrives in the night, untouched by empathy.Valluvar saw this long ago. In1072, he speaks with bitter clarity:And so, they walk on, their pulse even — carrying the quietest death of all: a soul untouched by guilt.","Bharathi bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic tamil text ‘thirukkural’ written by tamil poet and philosopher thiruvalluvar, the kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

EC vs Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission (EC) on Friday came down heavily on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over his allegations of large-scale voter fraud, accusing him of repeating an old political “script” and challenging him to either formally verify his claims or apologise to the nation.In a statement, the poll body claimed the leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha had raised “baseless” charges similar to those made in 2018 by then Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Kamal Nath , which were dismissed by the Supreme Court.Also read: Rahul Gandhi responds to EC’s 'sign affidavit' dare; demands full e-voter data “At his recent press conference, Rahul repeated a tired script. In 2018, it was then Kamal Nath, the then President of MPCC; today, it’s the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha playing the same tune,” the EC said.According to the EC, in 2018, Congress leaders attempted to mislead the court by producing documents from a private website to claim errors in electoral rolls, including instances where “the same face was shown again for as many as 36 voters.”The EC said those defects had been rectified months earlier and the details shared with the party. “The Court refused to accept the prayer of Kamal Nath. Now, in 2025, they, being aware that the same trick cannot be played in court, are trying to mislead the people by claiming irregularities in the electoral rolls,” it added.Also read: Priyanka Gandhi slams EC; backs Rahul's claims of voter fraud The Commission also cited a specific case involving the name of Aditya Srivastava, which Rahul claimed appeared in three different states. “In fact, [this] was rectified months ago,” it said. It further reminded the Congress leader that the Kamal Nath judgment had “settled” the position on machine-readable electoral rolls, and accused him of disregarding the Supreme Court’s decisions.“Law provides a specific procedure for both making objections to the roll and for making an appeal. Instead of availing the legal processes, he tried to sensationalise the issue by making baseless claims in the media,” the statement said.“If Rahul believes in his analysis and believes that his allegations against the EC are true, he should have respect for the law and sign the Declaration, or apologise to the nation for raising absurd allegations against the EC.”The standoff follows letters from the chief electoral officers (CEOs) of Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Haryana asking Rahul to submit the names of voters he believes were wrongly included or removed, along with a signed oath under Rule 20(3)(b) of the Registration of Electors Rules, 1960.The Karnataka CEO reminded him that rolls are prepared transparently under the Representation of the People Act, while Maharashtra and Haryana officials noted that Congress had not filed any formal appeals over alleged discrepancies.On Thursday, Rahul alleged “vote chori” in a Karnataka constituency involving 1,00,250 votes and irregularities in the rolls.Also read: Rahul Gandhi poses 5 questions day after big 'vote theft' claim; says poll body acting as BJP 'agent' Dismissing the Commission’s demand for a signed declaration, he said: “I am a politician; what I say to the people is my word. I am saying it to the people publicly, take it as an oath. Interestingly, they haven’t denied the information.” He accused the EC of colluding with the BJP to “undermine democracy” and warned polling officials allegedly involved of consequences if the Opposition came to power.He also claimed that the EC was “destroying evidence” by limiting the preservation of CCTV and webcasting footage to 45 days unless election results were legally challenged. “It is the 21st century; you can keep as much data as you want in a hard drive, even 10 years old data, but the Election Commission wants to destroy the CCTV footage in 45 days,” he said.The poll body earlier said Rahul had failed to respond to its June 12 letter inviting him to substantiate earlier claims of “rigging” in the Maharashtra Assembly elections. “Why? Is it because his media statements were baseless?” EC sources told PTI.Rahul has warned that such alleged irregularities could be repeated in the upcoming Bihar elections","'rahul gandhi repeated a tired script': ec says.

Did the BJP 'collude' with ECI?

Will SIR now get the INDIA bloc's nod?



NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi , long a fierce critic of the Election Commission of India (ECI), on Thursday presented what he called “criminal evidence” to back his “vote chori” charge in recent polls that left the Congress in tatters.In his presentation, the Lok Sabha leader of opposition alleged serious lapses in the electoral rolls of Mahadevapura assembly constituency, part of the Bangalore Central Lok Sabha seat in Congress-ruled Karnataka.During a press briefing, Gandhi displayed a spiral-bound stack of documents, which he said were drawn from the “7-foot pile” of electoral rolls provided by the ECI. He alleged that votes were stolen in five ways : duplicate votes, fake or invalid addresses, bulk voters at a single address, invalid photos, and misuse of Form 6 (application to add a name to the voter list in India).Interestingly, just as Rahul presented his “proof,” the Karnataka chief electoral officer wrote to him, seeking the material he had shown to the nation along with an oath-bound declaration, as a prerequisite for the probe to begin.The poll body’s letter seeking Rahul’s declaration gave the rival BJP fresh ammunition, which accused the Congress leader of “threating the institution” and claimed that by flagging loopholes in the electoral rolls, the Raebareli MP had effectively endorsed the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in Bihar, which aims to tighten loose ends in the poll rolls.Rahul Gandhi did not appear to budge on the EC notice, saying: ""I'm saying it publicly to everybody.Take it as an oath. This is their data, and we are displaying their data. This is not our data.""On whether the Congress leader would submit a declaration to the ECI, Congress leader Udit Raj told TOI: ""The Election Commission will try to find certain things in that, whether right or wrong. Then the BJP will take over that, and finally, they'll try to dilute it. Why is the Election Commission not answering? Why will CCTV footage be destroyed in 45 days when data can be stored for 100 years? ""He was referring to ECI's order to state poll officers to destroy election CCTV, webcasting, and video footage 45 days after the results, if no court challenge is filed.When asked if the Congress party would move the Supreme Court in case the deadlock with the Election Commission continues, the former Lok Sabha MP said: ""Our court is public. The way one judge has made a frivolous and strange comment about Rahul Gandhi. BJP MP has said that China has encroached on the land. Ladakh people are crying, even satellite pictures have shown how much land has been encroached, and here the judge says: Give the proof. What to do? If there are certain judges like these, what to do? They will turn down. ""However, he added, ""definitely we believe in the institutions, provided that the institutions give justice. Institutions were created by Congress, but when institutions are subverted and pressure is built, then, of course, we have to fight, and finally, there's a people's court, which is the highest court for a political party.On the question of whether the INDIA bloc would boycott the upcoming election if the issue remains unresolved, he said: ""We will resort to all kinds of methodologies to fight it out. Any option which is available within the framework of democracy, we will exercise that.""Responding to Rahul Gandhi's ""ECI colluding with BJP"" charge, national BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari told TOI: ""If ECI was colluding with the BJP, Rahul Gandhi would not have won his seat in Amethi, his sister would not have won her seat in Wayanad. Congress party government would not have been there in Telangana, Karnataka and the opposition government in Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu.""When asked if the ECI should probe into Rahul's claim, even if he refuses to submit the declaration, Bhandari said: ""That is under the purview of the wisdom of the Election Commission.""He, however, added that in case the Congress leader refuses to submit the declaration along with his ""proof"", it would become clear that Rahul Gandhi has ""lied again"".""The Election Commission has asked Rahul Gandhi for an oath, and if he doesn't give in writing it will be clear that, like he lied about Rafale, China-occupied Indian territory...Rahul Gandhi is yet again lying because he wants to divert attention from his imminent loss in Bihar,"" Pradeep Bhandari told TOI.The opposition INDIA bloc has vehemently criticised the intensive roll revision in Bihar, questioning the timing of the exercise and the alleged ""haste"" with which the entire process is being conducted in the poll-bound state.""We are questioning the timing. 35 BLOs are sitting in one place, and they are filling up the form. So 70 per cent of voters have not been approved. On their behalf, forms have been filled up and are incomplete. In some places, "" Trump and Dogbabu's "" names have appeared. Not even one booth is perfect,"" Udit Raj alleged.Countering Rahul Gandhi's criticism of SIR, Pradeep Bhandari said: ""Earlier, it was EVM, then the voter list went to Maharashtra, where the Bombay high court dismissed the plea. Now, a new thing has come, SIR. In the presentation that Rahul Gandhi showed, even there, Rahul inadvertently became a proponent of SIR rather than opposing it.""""Let Rahul Gandhi and the RJD go to the voters of Bihar with this as an agenda, we will go with our developmental agenda,"" he said, adding: ""Only person who should worry is Tejashwi Yadav, whose two voter IDs were found, and he is to answer how a leader of the opposition party in Bihar was holding two voter ID cards.""Whether Rahul Gandhi’s claims trigger a serious probe or fade into another round of political crossfire now rests in the court of public opinion.Notwithstanding, the episode has become a test of credibility for both sides, with its outcome likely to shape how future challenges to voter lists are addressed and how much trust the public places in the electoral process.","Rahul gandhi presented what he called “criminal evidence” to back his “vote chori” charge in recent polls that left the congress in tatters.

The EC also asked for a signed declaration so that ""necessary proceedings"" could be initiated.In a letter to Gandhi soon after he levelled allegations of vote fraud, the Karnataka chief electoral officer (CEO) said that during a press conference in the national capital, ""you had mentioned about the inclusion of ineligible electors and exclusion of eligible electors in the Electoral Rolls.""""You are kindly requested to sign and return the enclosed declaration/oath under Rule 20(3)(b) of the Registration of Electors Rules, 1960, along with the name(s) of such elector(s) so that necessary proceedings can be initiated.""Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also slammed the Election Commission over its officials asking Rahul Gandhi to share details of his claims on poll rigging under oath. Asked about the issue, Priyanka Gandhi said, ""Understand this, the affidavit they are asking for is under a law in which you have to give a petition within 30 days otherwise nothing will happen.So why are they asking for the affidavit. Such a big disclosure has been made. If there is an intentional mistake then investigate it.""Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi, in the Bengaluru rally, also alleged that following the Congress party 's claims, election commission websites of some states were taken down. ""The EC has shutdown Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and other states' websites after our expose,"" he said.He demanded that the EC provide the party with complete access to the electronic voter list for the entire country, along with video records. ""We demand EC to give us the electronic voters list of the entire country, give details of videography,"" Gandhi said.""If we get the electronic voter list then we will prove that the prime minister of this country has become the PM by way of theft.""He added, ""We demand the EC to provide us the 10 years of electronic voters' lists along with videography.""He further added, “And if this demand are not met, then we will presume the vote theft has occurred across the country.”Targeting election commission officials, Gandhi furthr said, ""The EC officials by way of this illegality are attacking the constitution and the poor of this nation.""He concluded his remarks with a warning: ""We will take time but we will catch you, we will catch each one of you.""Rahul Gandhi on Thursday had cited an analysis of data from a Lok Sabha constituency in Karnataka from the 2024 general elections to allege that the Election Commission is colluding with the BJP to ""steal elections"" and called it a ""crime"" against the Constitution.Talking to the media through an online presentation, Gandhi had said they analysed the voter data of Lok Sabha constituency of Bangalore Central and the Mahadevapura Assembly segment in it from the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.He said in the whole Lok Sabha seat, the Congress got 6,26,208 votes while the BJP got 6,58,915, a margin of 32,707.Gandhi pointed out that while the Congress won six out of seven segments, it lost in the Mahadevapura Assembly segment in which it was defeated by over 1,14,000 votes.He claimed there was ""vote chori"" of 1,00,250 votes in the constituency with 11,965 duplicate voters in one assembly segment, 40,009 voters with fake and invalid addresses, 10,452 bulk voters or single address voters, 4,132 voters with invalid photos and 33,692 voters misusing Form 6 of new voters.Alleging that is being committed throughout the country, he said this is a ""crime against the Indian Constitution and the Indian flag"".Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge had also backed Rahul Gandhi's allegations on ""vote fraud"" in Karnataka and said it was time to save democracy and the Constitution as well as the country.In a post on X, he said, ""When a political party raised questions with the Election Commission, it would respond or provide clarification within the bounds of constitutional dignity.""""Today, when someone questions the ECI, instead of responding, it acts like a representative of the ruling party, levelling counter-allegations and making baseless statements without considering the demands of opposition parties,"" Kharge said in his X post in Hindi.","Congress leader rahul gandhi repeated his allegation of ""vote theft"" and demanded the full electronic voter list from the election commission.

Absolutely, transparency is key. No, it should remain confidential.

NEW DELHI: A day after unveiling his “atom bomb” of evidence against the Election Commission of India (ECI), Rahul Gandhi on Friday posed five questions to the poll body, repeating his charge that it carried out “voter theft” in collusion with the ruling BJP during the 2024 Lok Sabha and later state assembly elections.""Election Commission, there are 5 questions - the country demands answers:1. Why isn't the opposition getting the digital voter list? What are you hiding?2. CCTV and video evidence are being erased - why? On whose orders?3. Fake voting and tampering with the voter list - why?4. Threatening and intimidating opposition leaders - why?5. Tell us clearly - has the ECI now become an agent of the BJP?,"" the Congress MP wrote on X.""India's democracy is priceless - the consequences of its theft will be dire. Now the public is speaking - enough is enough!"" the Lok Sabha leader of opposition added.On Thursday, Gandhi alleged that 1,00,250 “fake votes” were added in the Mahadevapura assembly segment of Karnataka’s Bangalore Central Lok Sabha constituency to secure a fourth consecutive win for the BJP candidate.Presenting what he called detailed evidence of the “fraud” at the Congress headquarters in Delhi, the Raebareli MP accused the ECI of colluding with the BJP, claiming the ""arrangement"" helped Prime Minister Narendra Modi win a third term.“Narendra Modi became prime minister with just a margin of 25 seats… The Election Commission is helping the BJP destroy the electoral system in India. They are not giving us the data because of what we did in Mahadevapura — if we do it in other Lok Sabha seats, the truth about our democracy will come out,” Gandhi said.The former Congress president also accused the poll panel of “destroying evidence” by directing that CCTV and webcasting footage of the election process be preserved for only 45 days after the process is completed, unless the result is legally challenged.Following Gandhi’s claims of voter roll manipulation, the Karnataka chief electoral officer (CEO) asked him to submit his evidence under oath, a request echoed by the CEOs of Maharashtra and Haryana.","Rahul gandhi asks five questions to the election commission of india (eci) he repeats his charge that it carried out “voter theft” in collusion with the ruling bjp.

No declaration on oath? Then apologise: EC official to Rahul,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-declaration-on-oath-then-apologise-ec-official-to-rahul/articleshow/123196493.cms,"NEW DELHI: As EC stuck to its insistence on Congress' Rahul Gandhi furnishing a signed declaration to the chief electoral officers of Karnataka, Maharashtra and Haryana, affirming his 'massive voter fraud' allegations, a commission official said the only other option for him, if he fails to do so, is to ""apologise to the nation for raising absurd allegations against EC"".""If Rahul does not sign the declaration, it would mean he does not believe in his analysis and resultant conclusions, and is making baseless allegations,"" said an EC functionary. The three CEOs had expected him to submit the documents along with the declaration on Thursday itself but are still waiting. During a meeting with Karnataka PCC chief DK Shivakumar on Friday, the state CEO sought a similar declaration from him.Justifying the condition placed on Rahul to submit details of the alleged roll irregularities under oath, before it initiates further proceedings, the EC officer explained: ""Rahul has never signed any complaint made to EC. Whatever reply the commission has been giving is to some other entity from AICC, giving him scope to disown it later"".EC on Friday also rejected Rahul's fresh charge on non-functioning of EC website.""It's functioning seamlessly since its launch,"" it said and added that e-roll for all states can be downloaded from the website.Another EC functionary pointed out that Rahul had, at his press conference, repeated a ""tired"" script. On his demand that EC share the electoral roll in a ""machine-readable format"", the officer cited SC's rejection of a similar prayer by Congress' Kamal Nath in 2018.""In 2018, they tried to mislead SC by producing documents from a private website to demonstrate that the roll showed the same face for 36 voters. In reality, the defects were rectified four months before that and a copy of the corrected roll was supplied to the party. This was made a ground to seek rolls in a searchable PDF format, which was turned down by court,"" an EC officer said and added that Rahul's raising the issue again shows he has no respect for SC's decisions. The official said Rahul and his aides are trying to mislead people by claiming that the same electors are registered at different places.","Ec stuck to its insistence on congress' rahul gandhi furnishing a signed declaration to the chief electoral officers of karnataka, maharashtra and haryana.
