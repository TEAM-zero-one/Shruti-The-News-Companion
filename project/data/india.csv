Mamata Banerjee vs Election Commission: Supreme Court Orders Judicial Oversight in Bengal SIR

NEW DELHI: With nine of the 12 states covered in Phase 2 of special intensive revision (SIR) having published their final electoral roll - including six on Saturday - their combined electorate is down 7.9% to 19.7 crore, as compared to 21.4 crore at the time of announcement of SIR exercise on October 27, 2025.Over 1.7 crore electors have been struck off the electoral rolls of the nine states/UTs - Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Lakshadweep, Puducherry, Goa and Andaman & Nicobar Islands - on account of SIR. While the final electoral rolls of Gujarat, Puducherry and Lakshadweep were published earlier, those for Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Rajasthan, Goa and Andaman & Nicobar were published on Saturday.Interestingly, the range of net decline in electors at the end of SIR varies from a steep 16.9% in Andaman & Nicobar and 13.4% in Gujarat to just 0.3% in Lakshadweep and 3.2% in Kerala. While four of the nine states/UTs recorded net deletions above the 7.9% overall average, it was the opposite in five states/UTs.Three states - West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu - are yet to publish their final electoral roll as part of SIR phase 2.While Tamil Nadu's roll will be out on Feb 23, the timeline for West Bengal is Feb 28 and for UP, April 10.Among the six states where SIR stands concluded, Gujarat saw the highest net decline in its electorate since the start of SIR, at around 68 lakh or 13.4%. Chhattisgarh's electorate shrunk by 11.8% and Goa's by 10.7%. The remaining three states saw a modest decline: with Kerala's final electorate down by 3.2%, Madhya Pradesh's by 5.9% and Rajasthan's by 5.7%.Among the UTs, only Andaman and Nicobar saw a sharp net decline of 16.9% in its electors. Puducherry electorate was 7.6% less than what it was on Oct 27, 2025; the decline in Lakshadweep was just over 0.3%.While Phase 1 of SIR completed last year was exclusive to Bihar, Assam witnessed only a special summary revision. Another 22 states and UTs are yet to conduct SIR. EC recently indicated that it may start the next phase of SIR in April.","Nine of the 12 states covered in phase 2 of special intensive revision (sir) have published their final electoral roll.

'Won’t Spare A Single Infiltrator': Amit Shah’s Poll Promise In Assam, Slams Cong Over Infiltration

GUWAHATI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday accused the opposition of turning infiltrators into a vote bank and said if BJP returns to power in Assam in the upcoming assembly elections, infiltrators will be removed from the electoral rolls and deported from the country within five years.He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi possesses the “courage, determination, and firm resolve to free the country from infiltrators”.“The support of the state govt is essential to remove infiltrators, which would never be possible if the opposition party comes to power,” he said.He further said the Election Commission is conducting the Summary Revision (SIR) to help identify infiltrators, but “the Leader of the Opposition has launched an agitation against it.” Shah said, “The country will certainly be freed from infiltrators. Under our govt, the country is becoming free from Naxalism, and in the same way, Assam and the entire nation will also become free from infiltrators.”Shah was speaking at the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the Assam Police 10th Battalion headquarters at Kachutoli near the city on the land that was freed from encroachers in 2024.“During the rule of the opposition party’s govt, infiltrators had encroached upon 174 bighas of land, which has now been freed from their possession by the present chief minister of Assam, Himanta Biswa Sarma, and today’s programme is being held on that very land,” he said.“At the very place from where security challenges had once emerged, the 10th Battalion of the Assam Police — which will eliminate those challenges — is now being established,” he said.He added that the land occupied by infiltrators had posed a major threat to Guwahati, Assam, and the entire country and the “presence of these infiltrators was a serious challenge to the development of Assam.”Shah said,“During the tenure of the previous govt, infiltrators had entered the region and pushed Assam’s demographic situation to a dangerous level.The opposition party bears direct responsibility for several areas of Assam — such as Dhubri, Barpeta, Morigaon, Darrang, Bongaigaon, and Nagaon — becoming infiltrator-dominated.”He highlighted that chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has freed nearly 1.45 lakh bighas of land from infiltrators and provided govt jobs to more than 1.4 lakh people in Assam without corruption and issued a firm pledge, “If our govt is formed again in the next five years, we will identify and deport every infiltrator from the country.”Shah alleged that infiltrators had become a vote bank for the opposition and declared, “Once our party’s govt is formed, within the next five years we will remove infiltrators not only from the electoral rolls but also from the country.”Accusing the opposition of endangering Assam’s identity, Shah said, “By allowing infiltrators to enter, the opposition party handed over Assam’s fertile land to them, which harmed the identity of the Assamese community and also put its cultural heritage at risk.”","Amit shah says if bjp returns to power in assam in the upcoming assembly elections, infiltrators will be removed from the electoral rolls and deported from the country.

NEW DELHI: The next big wave of reforms must come from the states if India wants to become a developed nation by 2047, as most of the heavy lifting at the Centre has been done, Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam said Saturday.“Most of the action in India is now at the state level.

States that push reforms move ahead, while others risk falling behind,” added Subrahmanyam.He said India’s demographic profile gives it a significant opportunity. “India is in for good times… demography is behind us, our capabilities are behind us and there is wind in our sails,” however, he said becoming a developed nation will require sustained high growth.At the event, Vianai Systems founder Vishal Sikka said India must build its own AI stack and not become dependent on systems it does not understand or control.","The next big wave of reforms must come from the states if india wants to become a developed nation by 2047, says niti aayog ceo bvr subrahmanyam. “most of the action in india is now at the state level.

GURGAON: Eleven Class 10 students missed their CBSE board maths paper on Tuesday after their school in Sector 9 failed to get them admit cards following a dispute over affiliation, sparking nightlong protests by parents and a police complaint.Parents alleged that Educrest International School kept delaying the admit cards despite taking full fees in advance, leaving families panicked and students uncertain about whether they would be allowed to write the remaining papers. Out of a batch of 25, only 14 students received hall tickets.The rest reached the test centre without an admit card, only to be turned back despite months of preparation.The school, parents said, had a CBSE affiliation only till Class 8, but had got students registered for board exams through other institutions. They claimed they were repeatedly assured that ""all formalities were complete"", but the admit cards were held back until the last moment.The situation escalated over the weekend. According to parents, the school first promised the admit cards on Saturday, then shifted the deadline to Monday afternoon, and later to Monday evening. Late in the evening, they were told several students had missed registration timelines and their admit cards had not been released.""Our children prepared for the exams through the year, but were informed only at the last moment that their admit cards had not been released.

""We attempted to transfer the students to other schools in Gurgaon to ensure their registration. However, these attempts largely failed.

""We are in the process of filing a petition in the high court,"" he said, adding that lawyers had been hired to draft a petition seeking the court's permission to let the students appear for the remaining papers.A senior CBSE official said the affected students could write the remaining papers if they got their admit cards by then. ""If a student misses a few papers, they can be put in the compartment category. They can take a supplementary exam later this year without having to repeat the entire year,"" the official added.

BENGALURU: Haunted by morbid thoughts of who would take care of his wife upon his death, a former Isro staffer, 76, allegedly strangled his wife to death on Wednesday morning, contemplated ending his life by suicide, but panicked and aborted the plan.Police officers probing the case said Nageshwar Rao, who retired as a team leader, is under treatment for unstated psychological issues. The incident took place in a senior living community in Bengaluru's Whitefield area, a first such case in many years.According to preliminary investigations, Rao used a bath towel to smother Sandhya Shri, 63, while she was preparing lunch in the kitchen around 10.15am in The Virtuoso in Bommenahalli. Rao has been arrested on charges of murder.The couple from Andhra Pradesh purchased the flat three years ago. Their only daughter is settled in the US. Informed by police, the daughter is flying to Bengaluru, sources said.""After the woman collapsed, Rao sat near her body for 20 minutes. He called a neighbour, asking him to come home immediately as he had killed his wife. The neighbour thought it was a joke. When Rao repeatedly said it, the neighbour rushed in,"" police said.Seeing Sandhya motionless on the floor, the neighbour called a doctor in the apartment. Since many senior citizens live in the apartment, an ambulance and a doctor are deployed round the clock.""The doctor examined Sandhya and declared her dead. Then, the doctor called police,"" an investigating officer said.When police entered the flat, Rao was sitting on the sofa and readily confessed to the incident. ""Yes, I killed her. I may not live more than 3-4 years from now. Who'll look after her after my death? We don't have close relatives in Bengaluru,"" he said.However, when a senior police officer questioned him about the motive, Rao answered the query with a blank stare.The incident has jolted police and geriatric caregivers. A cop said: ""This shocking episode comes at a time when community-living residences for senior citizens are gaining popularity in Bengaluru.""","Nageshwar rao, 76, allegedly strangled his wife to death on wednesday morning.

‘Chasing shadow in room of mirrors’: Why Delhi Police can’t crack the school bomb threat puzzle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/chasing-shadow-in-room-of-mirrors-why-bomb-hoax-probes-hit-dead-end/articleshow/128571891.cms,"Blame It On Ironclad Privacy Of Swiss Servers, Geopolitical Opacity Of Foreign Domains, VPN Shields

AI Impact Summit, Supreme Court on CAA, India-France Ties & More





NEW DELHI: After some south Delhi schools received bomb hoaxes earlier this month, a technical probe led police to a virtual private network (VPN) service in Bangladesh. Days later, a spate of similar threats in northwest Delhi led them to a US-based VPN, while hoaxes reported in west Delhi schools a few months ago involved a Singapore-based VPN. However, even as police were busy writing to these networks to gather user details, they were flooded with more hoaxes.So, why is the law enforcement seemingly helpless in curbing this menace?When a threatening email lands in the inbox of a school in the city, the tactical response in the form of blaring sirens, evacuation of students and deployment of sniffer dogs and cops on the campuses is loud and swift.However, in tech dens of the police cyber cell, the reaction is quieter and the fightback uphill and borderline demoralising. For Delhi's cyber-investigators, each hoax call represents a forensic dead end.Despite a string of such high-profile scares stretching into early 2026, the perpetrators remain digital ghosts. The inability to crack these cases isn't due to a lack of manpower, but owing to unsurmountable technical hurdles: the ironclad privacy of Swiss servers, geopolitical opacity of foreign domains and multi-layered shields of VPNs.When investigators attempt to ‘ping' the origin of a threat, they aren't led to a desktop in Delhi, but to a server in a jurisdiction like Panama or the Seychelles. Using VPN chains — routing a connection through multiple encrypted tunnels — the perpetrator ensures that the IP address visible to Delhi Police is a dummy.""The hoaxers hide their actual location in Delhi or elsewhere behind a series of encrypted ‘tunnels'. The IP address that police see may belong to a server in Austria, Singapore or Netherlands. To us, it is like chasing a shadow in a room full of mirrors; every time we think we have a lead, the trail bounces to another country,"" said a cyber cell investigator.To get a real IP, police must request logs from a VPN provider. However, most premium services used by these actors operate on a strict no-log policy, meaning they do not store records of who use their services at a specific time. Simply put, there's no data to be handed over to the cops. So, the trail doesn't just go cold, it ceases to exist in the physical world.This wall of anonymity is reinforced by the choice of platform. In several high-profile waves of bomb threats, including the massive surge in hoaxes in May 2024 and the recent cases this month, the senders utilised Switzerland-based ProtonMail. Known for its militant commitment to privacy, ProtonMail uses end-to-end encryption, which even it can't bypass, and does not require a phone number or personal details to create an account. From an investigative standpoint, this is a nightmare.Because the service is protected by Swiss privacy laws, Delhi Police can't issue a standard search warrant. It must navigate the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty — a diplomatic marathon that requires proving ‘double criminality' (that the act is a crime in both India and Switzerland). Even then, the most police may receive is basic metadata — like the time of the creation of an account — which is rarely enough to identify a sophisticated user who had signed up using a masked identity.The ‘Russian angle' adds a final layer of complexity. Many hoax emails carry an ‘.ru' suffix, often from services like mail.ru. Investigators frequently find that these domains are used as a tactical smokescreen.By the time a request for information moves through the bureaucratic channels of Interpol, the specific account is usually deleted and the logs are overwritten.Occasionally, police do catch a break — usually when a ‘copycat' or a student makes a fundamental error in operational security, such as forgetting to turn on the VPN or using a personal recovery email. In late 2024, a student in Delhi was apprehended after sending a threat to his own school to avoid taking an an exam. He had forgotten to turn on his VPN, leaving his home IP address exposed.However, for the professional operators who target dozens of schools simultaneously, the global digital architecture is their greatest ally. The sheer volume of schools targeted — sometimes over 100 in a single morning — suggests a level of planning that involves scraping school databases from the dark web or using automated crawlers.So, as long as this infrastructure allows for perfect anonymity, all Delhi Police can do is operate within a reactive loop: evacuate students, search bags and declare hoaxes, while those behind the screen remain digital phantoms.","Blame it on ironclad privacy of swiss servers, geopolitical opacity of foreign domains, vpn shields.

He said that many children died in it, but his daughter Maya was alive and the doctors have said that she will have to undergo two surgeries and for that he needs money urgently. The complainant sent Rs 30,000 to help him for daughter's treatment. He said that since he was in the war-torn area of Yemen, he couldn't send money from his bank accounts and needed more money for Maya's operation.""He sent me some bank account numbers and asked me to send money to them.

NEW DELHI: A special POCSO court in Prayagraj on Saturday directed the police to register an FIR against Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati and his disciple Swami Mukundanand Giri in connection with allegations of sexual exploitation.ADJ (POCSO Act) Vinod Kumar Chaurasia ordered the FIR registration and a detailed investigation into the matter. The case will be registered at Jhunsi police station following the court’s directions. The application under Section 173(4) was filed by Shakumbhari Peethadhishwar Ashutosh Brahmachari Maharaj, seeking strict action, news agency ANI reported.Reacting to the court order seer said, “Yes, it is appropriate. Only when a case is registered will the subsequent process of investigation and recording of testimony be completed. Only then will the truth of the false case filed against us come before everyone, and those responsible for doing this can be punished. Therefore, it is necessary. We would only say that the court should proceed with this at a faster pace without taking too much time, as many people are watching this matter.Testimony should be recorded and a decision taken as soon as possible. What is wrong will remain wrong, and the false case that has been filed will ultimately be proven false.”The move comes amid a backdrop of controversy surrounding Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati. Last month, the seer claimed he was prevented from taking a ritual dip at the Sangam during the Magh Mela in Prayagraj, leading him to stage an 11-day sit-in protest. Speaking to reporters in Varanasi, he said, “When I sat there for 11 days, no official asked me to take a dip. Now it is too late. I will go to the Magh Mela next year and take a respectful bath. ”The seer had also urged Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath to stop beef exports from the state and declare the cow as ‘Rajya Mata’, calling it a measure of the government’s commitment as a “Hindu sympathiser.”The controversy traces back to January 18, when Swami Avimukteshwaranand, travelling in a palanquin to the Sangam for Mauni Amavasya, was asked by officials to dismount and proceed on foot due to heavy crowds. The Mela administration alleged that his supporters broke a barricade on a pontoon bridge, causing crowd management issues.Following the incident, the seer protested outside the Shankaracharya camp, demanding an apology and a dignified escort for the ritual bath. The administration also issued a notice questioning his use of the title of Shankaracharya of Jyotish Peeth, citing a civil appeal pending before the Supreme Court.The row triggered political and administrative reactions. Prashant Kumar Singh, deputy commissioner in the Uttar Pradesh GST department, resigned citing moral reasons and Bareilly city magistrate Alankar Agnihotri also stepped down, highlighting concerns over the alleged insult to the seer. The Congress party announced a campaign against the perceived insult, demanding that the state governor take suo motu cognisance.","The case will be registered at jhunsi police station following the court’s directions.

'BJP's reign of terror is ongoing in MP': Congress reacts to the protest

NEW DELHI: A clash broke out on Saturday between Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party workers during a protest by the BJP against a “shirtless” demonstration by Indian Youth Congress (IYC) members at the India AI Impact Summit.According to the video circulating on social media, the confrontation saw stone-pelting, prompting police intervention to control the situation and ensure public safety.Deputy Commissioner of Police Krishna Lalchandani said that the clash occurred near the Congress office, where the BJP protest was underway.“There were two parties involved. One party was protesting. The protest was near the Congress office. The area had been barricaded, and proper police arrangements had been ensured. Suddenly, some rumour-mongering occurred, and some stones were thrown. Then, the other side also threw stones. Some people were injured... It's too early to say who threw the first stone,” Lalchandani added.The incident follows a “shirtless” protest staged by Youth Congress workers on Friday inside the Bharat Mandapam, accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of compromising the country’s interests during the AI summit.During the demonstration, protesters removed their shirts and raised slogans, drawing attention to what they described as a political and national concern.Patiala House Court on Saturday rejected bail applications for four arrested Youth Congress workers, Krishna Hari, Kundan Yadav, Ajay Kumar, and Narasimha Yadav and sent them to police custody for five days. Police said that the custody was needed to investigate a potential larger conspiracy, including the funding and planning of the protest. Three policemen were reportedly injured during the confrontation.Delhi Police officials said that the protesters had registered online to obtain QR codes to enter the venue and initially planned to use black umbrellas with printed stickers to convey their message.“However, they later felt that the black umbrellas might draw the attention of the security personnel manning the gates, so they changed their plan and got the printed stickers placed on T-shirts instead,” a police source said.The accused reportedly engaged in a scuffle with security personnel and police staff during the protest. Investigators are also examining if the demonstration was part of a wider conspiracy linked to similar protests in Nepal.The lawyer for the accused argued that the protest was a form of political dissent and that the workers were being targeted because of their party affiliation. “Political dissent shouldn’t be crushed like this. The accused are educated office bearers exercising their right to protest peacefully,” the lawyer said.The Congress party reacting to the incident, blamed the state BJP leadership for the violence.In a post on X, the party wrote, “The BJP's reign of terror is ongoing in Madhya Pradesh. BJP goons have stormed into the state Congress office. There, these goons engaged in scuffles with Congress workers and caused widespread vandalism. All this thuggery was carried out under the patronage of the BJP government. Here, the government itself is tearing the law to shreds. Immediate action must be taken against these BJP goons. ”","A clash broke out between congress and bharatiya janata party workers during a protest by the bjp against a “shirtless’ demonstration by indian youth congress (iyc) members at the india ai impact summit. According to the video circulating on social media, the confrontation saw stone-pelting, prompting police intervention to control the situation and ensure public safety.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128647333,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-4602961,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Why Congress can’t afford friction in Puducherry

Puducherry, the Union territory nestled within Tamil Nadu, will head to the polls in April alongside the state. But a growing rift between the Congress and its ally, the DMK — which governs Tamil Nadu on its own despite their alliance — now threatens to spill into Puducherry just months before the crucial assembly elections.At the heart of the conflict is the Congress’ demand for a share of power in Tamil Nadu if the DMK-led bloc wins again, along with a larger number of seats to contest than in 2021. Puducherry, given its geographical and cultural closeness to Tamil Nadu, is also emerging as a stage for this simmering rift.Manickam Tagore, a close confidant of former Congress president and current Lok Sabha leader of opposition, Rahul Gandhi, has been at the forefront of the party’s push for greater “respect” from the DMK in Tamil Nadu. Now, he is extending that demand for “respect” in Puducherry as well.How practical is Tagore's demand? Can he — or the Congress — compel the DMK to concede? How likely is it that the DMK would give in? And with elections approaching, can the alliance afford internal strains? Let’s take a closer look.The politics in Puducherry, a former French colony, has been dominated by the Congress. Three other parties have also formed governments here—DMK, AIADMK, and the All India NR Congress—but none have ever enjoyed the level of dominance that the Congress did.That dominance is evident in the numbers: of Puducherry’s 10 chief ministers, seven have hailed from the Congress.The UT's lone Lok Sabha seat has also mirrored this political success. The constituency, also called Puducherry, has been contested in 15 general elections since 1967 and has been won by the grand old party — either directly or through its factions — 11 times.This legacy perhaps explains why the Congress sees Puducherry as politically significant. Given its long-standing dominance and the stakes of a potential defeat, the Congress would be keen to reclaim its supremacy here.Against the backdrop of political tensions in Tamil Nadu, the first signs of a possible spillover to Puducherry emerged on February 6. That day, Tagore posted on social media, citing electoral data to argue that the Congress — and not the DMK — should lead their alliance in Puducherry.“Will the party with 8% of the votes lead the coalition? No, the party with 26% of the votes will lead. Why should the Congress party be talked down to in the coalition?” he asked.The data he referred to was from the 2014 general elections. He did not explain why he chose figures from more than a decade ago, particularly from a parliamentary election rather than an assembly contest. In that election, the Congress finished second in the Puducherry Lok Sabha constituency, while the DMK came fourth. The Congress candidate, V Narayanasamy, who became chief minister two years later and held the post for over four years, secured 26.35% of the vote, whereas DMK’s AMH Nazeem received 8.19% and came fourth.A visit to Puducherry by the DMK’s election in-charge and Lok Sabha MP, S Jagathrakshakan, appears to have triggered the current episode. During the trip, he did not meet Congress leaders, and this “snub,” coupled with the ongoing friction in Tamil Nadu, seems to have sparked Tagore's outburst.But beyond the immediate provocation, the larger question is whether his assertion is merely rhetorical posturing or grounded in electoral reality.Despite Tagore’s assertive stance, the ground reality appears far less encouraging - if not outright alarming -for the Congress in Puducherry, where it was once the dominant political force. While the DMK remains the undisputed leader of the alliance in Tamil Nadu, the Congress now finds itself on comparatively weaker footing in Puducherry. Although it won the Puducherry seat in the two most recent general elections, its performance in the 2021 assembly polls was far less impressive. The Congress secured just two of the 14 seats it contested — a steep drop from the 15 it had won out of 21 during a successful campaign five years earlier.In contrast, the DMK, which contested 13 assembly constituencies under the seat-sharing arrangement, won six of them — securing the post of the leader of opposition in the assembly. The DMK, which is currently headed by Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin, had managed just two of the nine seats it contested in 2016.Tagore’s remarks could, therefore, be read either as election-season posturing or as a calculated attempt to pressure the DMK — in Puducherry or even in Tamil Nadu.The DMK remains a significant political player in Puducherry, while the Congress has been largely marginal in Tamil Nadu — last heading a government there in 1967 and last holding the leader of opposition post in 1996.The Dravidian major’s categorical refusal to share power in the southern state — a stance reiterated by Stalin himself — presents a major challenge for the Congress, leaving it to try and assert itself in Puducherry, where its historical influence still exists and where the party held power as recently as 2021.However, the Congress’ leverage — or lack thereof — in Tamil Nadu is already evident. The state Congress unit has urged the party’s national president, Mallikarjun Kharge, to take action against Tagore for his criticisms of the DMK, which itself has also called for action against the Virudhunagar MP.Whether the DMK exercises this leverage in Puducherry too or concedes ground to the Congress to maintain alliance cohesion ahead of the elections would shape not only the immediate electoral battle with the UT’s ruling NDA coalition, but also the longer-term balance of power between the two allies.With much at stake, the Congress can hardly risk tensions in Puducherry, especially on the eve of elections. With governments in only three states — Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, and Telangana — the Congress can ill afford fresh tensions within the alliance. A victory in Puducherry would provide a much-needed additional governing foothold and strengthen its hand within INDIA, the national opposition bloc it leads. Tensions within the opposition coalition have been simmering after a series of electoral setbacks following the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, in which they succeeded in reducing the BJP below the majority mark for the first time since 2014.For now, the Congress appears to be adopting a wait-and-watch approach. Whether this strategy bolsters its position or strains a key alliance ahead of the elections will soon be revealed.","Puducherry, the union territory nestled within tamil nadu, will head to the polls in april alongside the state.

Delhi Schools On High Alert After Khalistan Bomb Threat Emails Trigger Panic Across National Capital

The “Rainy Day” logins

Space, screen and social life

Shadows in the hallway: The new security normal

Bomb threats in Indian schools

The new landscape of normal

Remember waking up as a child to the sound of rain pouring and clouds rumbling, your very first thought whispering, “Will it be a rainy holiday today?”Let's say the modern-day school life has a new form of rainy holiday.Books have given way to tablets, chalkboards to smart boards. And the much-anticipated rainy-day “chutti” has been replaced by pollution-triggered online classes and bomb threat evacuations.In a recent incident, multiple schools in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, received bomb threat emails.Students were dispersed, investigations were launched, and nothing suspicious was ultimately found. Yet the disruption was real.Such incidents are no longer isolated. They mark a shift few could have imagined — a shift that is fast becoming routine.So, in this evolving landscape, has the idea of the impromptu day-off also transformed?Technology is no longer an add-on; it is the norm. Distance learning now runs parallel to physical classrooms.Since Covid, technology has been intricately woven into the students’ daily lives. Online classes have become the default response to disruption.For today’s children, a cancelled school day no longer translates into freedom.But in preserving continuity, something else has changed.But the larger question lingers: How is this reshaping the academic landscape? And more importantly, what is it doing to the children growing up within it? Have repeated pollution alerts and bomb threats begun to feel routine? Is a generation slowly being desensitised to dangers that should provoke alarm?The topography of the golden days of one’s life, the school life, has changed on a grand scale.For caregivers, the transition brings layered emotions. There is comfort in knowing education no longer collapses at the first sign of disruption. Technology offers stability.Yet there is unease, too. A nostalgia for simpler interruptions.And somewhere between nostalgia and necessity, a new version of school life is quietly taking shape — one that no one fully anticipated, yet one that an entire generation is learning to call normal.Parents describe a clear post-Covid shift in school life, where technology and online classes have moved from an emergency measure to a default backup for almost any disruption.Tejash Tarun, a Bengaluru-based parent, points to how even logistical inconveniences now trigger digital shifts rather than cancellations.“Even for relatively minor issues, say road renovations on the last stretch leading to the school, the classes are not cancelled now. Instead, the school would send out notifications for a week of online classes,” he says.His observation underscores a broader structural shift. Continuity now outweighs interruption, and the idea of a pause once embedded in school culture is steadily disappearing.Radhika Ashok Kumar, another parent, also notes that administrative and logistical needs increasingly push learning online.“Last year, the school was the centre for boards. So some sessions were planned online.”But online classes come with their own set of challenges. Tarun highlights the material demands that online education imposes on households.He says, “If a child is attending classes from home, they also need a proper space to study. Secondly, they need a suitable device. It cannot just be a mobile phone for a few minutes. A laptop or a computer is essential.”He further goes on to highlight the drawbacks the parents might face in their professional life, saying, “In case of working parents, and the work-from-home arrangements at offices largely over, if a child’s school suddenly shifts to online classes, it creates an immediate challenge. They may have to take leave or try to manage work from home, if that option is even available.”An idea largely promoted as institutional flexibility can, at the household level, translate into logistical strain.The learning space has extended beyond the school campuses.Across conversations, there is broad agreement that offline school remains irreplaceable for social, emotional and overall personality development – “no alternate” to going to school for real-world interaction with peers and teachers, learning social norms, and building discipline and routine.Manish Masoom, a Delhi-based parent whose child’s classes have witnessed an online shift due to the implementation of GRAP measures, shares the value of real-world interactions over online classes.He says, “Ideally, children should go to school, sit in a classroom, and learn alongside others. After all, human beings are social by nature. Whether the reason is pollution, a strike call, or any other disruption, shifting to online classes creates its own set of problems.”Tarun further elaborates on how he views the micro-lessons embedded in everyday school life.He says, “Beyond academics, school is where children learn community interactions. A classmate may borrow my pencil today; tomorrow, I might borrow their notebook. These small exchanges teach cooperation, sharing, and understanding.”When asked about the drawbacks of online classes, the parents highlighted the lack of preparation for their kids as offered by the offline classes.Radhika shares, “For the lower grades, I feel it was still manageable, at least in my son’s case. But in the higher classes, I have noticed that children struggle with subjects like Mathematics, Science, and Chemistry.”She further goes on to add that online classes often fall behind in preparing the students for a broader grasp on the pressure, as she says, “When students were in Class 9 during online sessions, some of them could not build a strong foundation. As a result, when they moved to Class 10, they found it hard to handle the academic pressure because their basics were not clear.”In preserving academic calendars, schools may have inadvertently widened conceptual gaps. And to top it, screen time has emerged as another difficult battle for parents.For some, e-learning sessions have significantly increased the number of hours their children spend in front of screens. For others, avoiding screens altogether feels nearly impossible.Parents point out that online classes add a non-negotiable stretch of screen exposure to a student’s day. However, beyond that, televisions, mobile phones, gaming, and social media continue to contribute to consistent digital engagement.In a landscape where education itself is mediated through devices, setting boundaries is no longer as simple as taking a gadget away. It becomes a delicate balancing act which calls for weighing academic necessity against cognitive rest, connectivity against overexposure.If digital shifts represent one dimension of change, recurring bomb threats and hoax emails represent another. It not only becomes a logistical issue but also influences the emotional climate.When it comes to bomb threats and hoax emails, parents’ memories cluster around a new kind of routine disruption. But how is this new chaos impacting children? Where is it driving their sensibility, and how are the schools and parents able to handle it?In a unanimous vote, the parents shared that the schools have done a commendable job in managing the situation without causing unnecessary panic for the students. There might or might not be an evacuation based on the intensity of the threat, but the students were surely not conveyed the panic.The evacuation was carried out calmly, without triggering direct panic among students, and was accompanied by clear and timely communication with parents.For rather younger kids, parents found it best keep the situation discreet for them.Neha Arora, a teacher and a parent based in Delhi, sheds light on the approach. She says, “Considering how young the children are, the school did not make any effort to explain the situation to them in clear or direct terms. We have also consciously kept him away from such news and incidents, as he is still too young to fully understand these concepts.”Older children, however, operate in a different information ecosystem. With access enabled, they have an extended curiosity about what happened.Aakansha Aashu shares how her 15-year-old reacted after his school was evacuated following a bomb threat message. She describes how curiosity shapes their reactions.“My son got deeply involved in discussions. Setting everything else aside, they start talking about who was involved, who the culprit might be, and who did what,” she says, “He didn’t enjoy these conversations, but there was no real sense of fear among them. They didn’t seem frightened either.”Masoom on the inevitability of information flow in the digital age. He goes on to add that his son has been curious about the incidents around in general. Despite being only 10 years old, he reads and understands everything.He attributed this awareness to access to technology. Whether they talk about certain things or not, the kids themselves go on to explore and understand and as a final step, they come back to their parents to get the answers.He says, “In today’s situation, whether I explain things to him or not, he already knows a lot. This information reaches children directly. Even if he does not watch the news, countless content creators are discussing such topics in different ways, some in a serious tone, others humorously or theatrically.He further adds, “Naturally, when children come across such content, they become curious. They try to understand it at their own level and then come to us with questions. He is only 10 years old — but they are certainly aware of more than we might expect.”At first glance, the contrast can feel almost apocalyptic. But history reminds us that every generation grows up in a version of the world reshaped by its time.What we are seeing today is not just a change in how schools function — it is a shift in what “normal” feels like for children.The simple thrill of an unexpected holiday, the shared pause when life briefly slowed down, the innocence of being shielded from larger anxieties — these small but meaningful parts of childhood are not fading, but is remolding itself.In their place stands a system optimised for stability, but one that asks children to adapt continuously while keeping their curiosity well fed.The question is no longer whether education can continue amid disruption. It clearly can.The more important conversation lies elsewhere: as schools evolve between nostalgia and necessity, how do we preserve the human rhythms, the joy, the pause, the sense of ease of the school day?","Technology is no longer an add-on; it is the norm.

'Still battling trauma'

A Pocso court in UP's Banda sentenced to death Friday a former govt junior engineer and his wife for sexually abusing 33 boys over a decade, some as young as three, and selling videos and photographs of their torture on the dark web to customers across 47 countries.Additional district judge PK Mishra said convicts Ram Bhawan (50) and Durgawati (47) inflicted such physical and psychological trauma on the survivors - some required hospitalisation for injuries to their genitals and a few developed squint eyes - that their crimes deserved to be categorised as ""rarest of rare"".""The sheer scale of this victimisation across multiple districts, combined with the extreme moral turpitude of the convicts, marks this as a crime of such an exceptional and heinous nature that it leaves no room for reformation, necessitating the ultimate judicial deterrent to meet the ends of justice,"" says the order. The court directed the UP govt to pay Rs 10 lakh in compensation to each of the 33 victims.Ram Bhawan, who worked in the UP jalkal (waterworks) department, and Durgawati would lure children by offering them access to online video games, money and gifts. They remained active in Banda and Chitrakoot from 2010 till 2020, when Interpol got CBI involved in an inquiry on child sexual abuse content on the dark web.CBI registered an FIR on Oct 31 that year after the trail led to Ram Bhawan and Durgawati.The agency had filed a chargesheet documenting their crimes on Feb 10, 2021.Special public prosecutor Kamal Singh Gautam said the case had an overwhelming amount of evidence of what the children were subjected to.""The survivors are still suffering the psychological trauma caused by the predators"", Gautam said.CBI had medical experts from AIIMS Delhi to examine 25 of the children who suffered severe injuries at the hands of the convicts. The prosecution relied on their reports, digital evidence and the testimonies of the children to build their case and seek capital punishment to those accused in the case.Additional district judge Mishra convicted the couple of offences ranging from aggravated penetrative sexual assault and using children for pornographic purposes to abetment and criminal conspiracy under relevant sections.","A pocso court in up's banda sentenced to death friday a former govt junior engineer and his wife for sexually abusing 33 boys over a decade.

'Parents should have say'

'Love marriage no crime'

Gujarat govt’s proposal that couples must inform their parents before tying the knot is yet to become law, but ‘or - ders’ to that effect are al - ready in force in parts of Gujarat, where some villages and communities have come out with detailed ‘codes’ intended to govern how their members marry.The amendments proposed in the state assembly on Friday reflect de - mands and actions being pushed on the ground, with scattered village reso - lutions hardening into communitylevel ‘constitutions’ — resolutions and declarations that threaten couples who marry for love with boycott, ostracism, and exclusion from public life.From gram sabhas in Kheda district to caste organisations of Patidars and Thakors, the consen - sus driving such declarations is that marriage without parental consent threatens tradition, destabilises so - cial order and endangers women.The gram sabha in Nand village in Mahudha taluka recently passed a res - olution imposing total social boycott on couples who marry despite opposi - tion from their families. Such couples are barred from community facilities, religious gatherings and social func - tions. The resolution also caps wed - ding and funeral expenses, prohibits DJs and “objectionable songs”, and imposes fines for violations.Bharat Solanki, the village sar - panch, said rising cases of marriage disputes had led to the decision. “We are a village of 5,000, mostly Thakors and Darbars. There have been sagotra (intra-clan) marriages, which are not permissible. When a couple elopes, it puts parents in an embarrassing po - sition. As these incidents have been rising, we decided to declare a ban on such marriages. Violate the ban, and you face boycott. ”The rules, Solanki insisted, spare no one. All communities in the vil - lage — including OBC and SC fami - lies, which form a minority — are required to comply. “The rules are for everyone. We are not targeting one single group. Violators pay Rs 21,000 fine and are excluded from village gatherings,” he said.Similar ‘rules’ are surfacing else - where, signalling a broader social churn. Village elders argue that couples who elope — their union is known locally as ‘bhagedu lagan’ — disrupt social harmony and bring dishonour to their families.Geni Thakor, Congress MP from Banaskantha who spearheaded the Thakor community’s campaign against such unions, said “the deci - sion was taken because (they) kept seeing fraudulent marriages"".“A girl marrying outside her com - munity weakens its social fabric. There have been instances where women are deceived by men, subject - ed to abuse and, in some cases, driven to suicide. Our aim is to protect our daughters,” said Thakor, who also cit - ed demographic factors, saying “the Patidar sex ratio is collapsing”.Following the proposed amend -ments, Thakor said she “was the first to raise the issue of ‘bhagedu lagan’ when the ‘love jihad’ bill (Gujarat Free - dom of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2021) was tabled in the assembly”. She insisted that “99% of love marriages fail and bring misery to the girl”. Asked about the basis for her claim, she said, “I have found this in villages; it might not be the case in big cities.”Among Patidars, opposition to such self-choice marriages has simmered for years. Lalji Patel, who heads the Sardar Patel Group (SPG), said the movement crystallised around paren tal anguish.“During Covid, parents came to us, begging us to rescue daughters trapped in sham marriages,” Patel said. “That is why we initiated these measures.” He said the SPG has been demand - ing that the legal age of marriage for women be raised from 18 to 21 even as he acknowledged that the Constitution allows adults to marry by choice. “But society matters. Parents are every - thing. They should have a say.”One pamphlet distributed by the Patidar Sena in Mehsana went beyond parental consent to call for sweeping changes, including par - ents’ signatures on marriage regis - tration for those aged 30 or younger. It also wanted court marriages to be restricted to the bride’s local juris - diction, 40 to be the minimum age of witnesses, and couples who marry by choice after 30 to deposit Rs 10 lakh in their parents’ accounts and forfeit any claim to family property.“These demands are born from the pain parents have gone through,” said Satish Patel, leader of the Mehsana Patidar Sena. Asked about the proposed rules, he said they were “not fully satisfied” as they also wanted “only blood relatives of girls to be signatories in the marriage registration as that ensures both parents and relatives bear full accountability for every such union”.Community leaders backing these demands insist they are not against people choosing whom they want to marry, but against secrecy and deception. “If a couple wants to marry and the parents agree, we have no objection,"" Lalji Patel said. “But parents must be involved. They’re the ones who will always shield their daughters.” He, too, said the latest proposal falls short of their demands.“The govt speaks of merely ‘informing’ parents, as though a notification is sufficient. We have demanded that parents’ consent be made mandatory.”Legal experts warn that such meas - ures strike at the core of constitu - tional freedoms but those who fall foul of such diktats say that they have to face serious difficulties in their day-to-day lives.A Dalit man from northern Gujarat who married a woman from the Darbar community in 2015 — Darbars are placed higher in the social hierarchy—said they have had to change their residence at least 50 times and stay off social media to avoid being traced. Both hold postgraduate de - grees but cannot find stable work.“We’ve not been able to work at one place. We are dependent on daily wages even though we both hold PG degrees,” the man said. “We took up jobs with NGOs, but my wife’s family members or relatives traced me there during fieldwork.”Kaushik Parmar, a lawyer from Mehsana who works with intercaste couples, slammed the proposed changes in the marriage registration rules, saying that “love marriage is not the enemy of society; it is the right of a free citizen”. “Every attempt to curb it weakens the Constitution and strengthens caste hierarchies. If we truly want a progressive, equal, and just society, we must see love marriage not as a crime but as an instrument of social change. These rules amount to the murder of democracy,” he said.",Gujarat govt’s proposal that couples must inform their parents before tying the knot is yet to become law.

1 in 7 stroke patients in India under 45 years: National Registry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1-in-7-stroke-patients-in-india-under-45-years-national-registry/articleshow/128631939.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: One in seven stroke patients in India is younger than 45 years. Nearly two in five reach hospital more than 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. Three months later, more than half either die or suffer significant disability.These findings come from India’s largest hospital-based stroke registry analysis, published in ‘International Journal of Stroke’. The study was led by Prashant Mathur of ICMR–National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research (ICMR-NCDIR), Bengaluru, along with investigators of the National Stroke Registry Programme.The analysis reviewed 34,792 stroke cases recorded across 30 hospitals between 2020 and 2022, providing one of the most detailed national snapshots of stroke patterns, treatment gaps and outcomes.The mean age of patients was 59.4 years, but 13.8% were under 45, underlining the growing burden of stroke among younger Indians. Nearly 63.4% were men and 72.1% came from rural areas, reflecting disparities in awareness, prevention and access to timely care.Hypertension was present in 74.5% of patients, making it the dominant risk factor. Diabetes affected 27.3%, smokeless tobacco use 28.5%, tobacco smoking 22.6% and alcohol use 20.2%.The study also noted gender differences — women had higher rates of hypertension and diabetes, while men reported greater tobacco and alcohol use.The time taken to get treatment remained the biggest hurdle, according to the analysis. Only 20% reached hospital within the crucial 4.5-hour window for emergency stroke treatment. In contrast, 37.8% reached hospital after 24 hours. As a result, just 4.6% of ischemic stroke patients received intravenous thrombolysis and 0.7% underwent mechanical thrombectomy, it said. Delayed arrival, imaging delays and non-availability of medicines were key reasons for missing treatment.Ischemic strokes accounted for 60% of cases, while intracerebral haemorrhage made up 34.2%.Dr Manjari Tripathi, head of neurology at AIIMS Delhi, said the numbers reinforced a basic message. “Patients must reach the hospital within three hours. Immediate brain imaging is essential, and, if eligible, thrombolysis should be given without delay. Time is brain — every minute lost means neurons lost, leading to disability and long-term dependence. It is vital that people recognise stroke symptoms and seek emergency care early,” she said.Outcomes remain stark as in-hospital mortality was 13.9%, but by three months, nearly 28% had died, indicating that many patients passed away after discharge. In total, more than half had a poor outcome, defined as death or significant disability. Women were more likely than men to have a disability at follow-up, suggesting possible gaps in rehabilitation and post-discharge care. Recurrent stroke within three months occurred in 1.1% of patients.The authors said stronger control of hypertension and diabetes, tobacco cessation, faster referral systems and better access to acute stroke care — particularly in rural India — were critical. Without improvements in prevention and rapid response, stroke would continue to strike early and leave families coping with avoidable disability.","One in seven stroke patients in india is younger than 45 years. Nearly two in five reach hospital more than 24 hours after onset of symptoms. Three months later, more than half either die or suffer significant disability. Findings come from india’s largest hospital-based stroke registry analysis.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128632069,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-643031,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

BJP Targets Rahul Gandhi Over AI Summit Protest Row

NEW DELHI: BJP stepped up its attack on Congress as it likened its protest at the AI summit to treason and claimed that Rahul Gandhi was the inspiration for his party's youth workers involved in the shirtless demonstration as he frequently defames India.Union minister Kiren Rijiju termed the protest as a ""big crime"" and ""big sin"" against the country, alleging that Congress tried to defame it when the world was lauding AI Impact Summit organised here under PM Narendra Modi's leadership.Its frustration has grown so much over its repeated electoral failures, that it has turned ""anti-national,"" he alleged.He told a press conference, ""If Congress had even an ounce of sensitivity towards the country, it would have introspected and apologised. Instead of expressing regret, Congress is justifying the misconduct of its members.""He said there is widespread anger across the country against the opposition party which turns sad and angry at the nation's progress.Lashing out at Congress, BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi slammed the protesters as ""flag-bearers of Lashkar-e-Rahul"" who tried to tarnish India's image.""What the Congress has done cannot be dismissed as mere negative politics, it amounts to treason,"" Trivedi alleged.So far Rahul used to make derogatory and offensive statements about India abroad, he claimed and then added, ""Now the flag-bearers and sepoys of Lashkar-e-Rahul are trying to tarnish India's image in front of foreign guests.""He alleged that the protest at the AI summit venue was a ""shameful display"" of the Congress' ""pettiness and nakedness"".","Bjp steps up its attack on congress as it likened its protest at the ai summit to treason.

Among the first to be killed were 13-year-old Wamiq Farooq and 17-year-old Tufail Mattoo, whose deaths became rallying points for widespread demonstrations. Sharma said Omar had justified the killings of Wamiq and Tufail, claiming they were part of a “rebellion” against the then govt led by him.The LoP then invoked July 13, 1931, when 22 people were shot dead by the forces of Maharaja Hari Singh outside Srinagar jail during protests against Dogra rule. The date is widely commemorated in Kashmir as ‘Martyrs’ Day’.Those killed in 1931 were remembered as ‘martyrs’ by NC, while Wamiq, Tufail and others killed in 2010 were charged with rebellion, Sharma said, adding “we need to reflect on this”.He accused NC of exploiting “Kashmiri sentiments” after failing to deliver on economic commitments, including promises of jobs and 200 units free electricity, and alleged that govt had outsourced 24000 jobs to an unknown company. “BJP will come on roads against such clandestine recruitments,” he said.NC spokesperson Imran Nabi Dar dismissed the allegations. “It is BJP that has failed to deliver on its promise of restoring statehood,” he said. Referring to July 13, 1931, Dar said the day symbolised Kashmiri resistance against monarchy and the assertion of Kashmir’s identity. “BJP is trying to build a fake narrative around it. They are trying the same with the events of 2010 to arouse sentiments in Kashmir in their favour,” he said.","Opposition leader of opposition in the j&k assembly, sunil sharma, launched a political attack on omar abdullah govt.

BHIWANDI: Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi appeared before a court here on Saturday in connection with a criminal defamation case stemming from remarks made during the 2014 Lok Sabha election campaign.Sources said Gandhi’s personal appearance was largely procedural and necessitated by the recent demise of his former surety, Shivraj Patil Chakurkar, who had stood guarantee for his bail.With the earlier surety holder passing away last month, fresh surety formalities were required to be completed before the court.The case dates back to a public rally in Sonale village in Bhiwandi taluka during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, where Gandhi allegedly stated that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) was responsible for the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.Following the speech, RSS office-bearer Rajesh Kunte filed a private complaint under Section 500 of the Indian Penal Code, accusing Gandhi of defaming the organisation.Advocate Narayan Iyer, representing Gandhi, said the appearance was mandated due to the submission of a new surety. “Gandhi was required to be present as a new surety has been furnished following the demise of his earlier surety. The hearing was primarily procedural,” Iyer told TOI.On Gandhi’s behalf, Maharashtra Congress president Harshwardhan Sapkal was presented as the new surety before the court.Iyer said that after Sapkal’s surety was submitted, Gandhi signed the bond.Iyer added that the matter has reached an advanced stage. “The chief examination and cross-examination of the complainant, Rajesh Kunte, have been concluded.

Ajit Pawar Dead In Baramati Plane Crash During Emergency Landing, Maharashtra In Political Shock

NEW DELHI: NCP (SP) general secretary Rohit Pawar on Saturday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking the resignation of civil aviation minister K Ram Mohan Naidu until the inquiry into the January 28 plane crash that killed former Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar is completed. He also demanded an independent and transparent probe into the incident.In his letter to the PM Modi, a copy of which was marked to Union home minister Amit Shah, Rohit Pawar raised concerns about the air charter company VSR, which owned the ill-fated Learjet 45 aircraft and alleged possible links that need independent scrutiny, according to news agency PTI.“Serious questions have been raised about the company VSR and its links with Rammohan Naidu's party (TDP). These links must be investigated by an independent and competent authority, preferably in collaboration with international agencies,” Pawar said in the letter.Seeking the minister’s resignation, he wrote, “You have always shown respect for Ajit Dada and his contribution to the country. In this context, I request that Rammohan Naidu be asked to resign from his post until the investigation is completed. This is necessary to ensure there is no influence or interference in examining whether the DGCA was compromised in any manner in relation to VSR.”Addressing a press conference, Rohit Pawar alleged that the circumstances surrounding the crash warrant deeper examination and suggested that the possibility of conspiracy must be explored.“If we talk about conspiracies, there can be two types of conspiracies: political and commercial. We want to find out which one it is. Another thing is that if someone is supporting or protecting the VSR company, which is responsible for it, that could also be a conspiracy. So many powerful people are behind this company. DGCA officials are behind it,” he said.Calling for direct intervention by senior national leaders, he added, “But if this investigation needs to be brought to justice, only the most powerful people in India, like Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, can bring justice to Ajit Dada, because the rest of the people involved are also powerful. I request them to personally address this investigation. I'm going to send a letter addressed to PM Modi via email today. .. The Aviation Minister must resign. This is our demand.”Rohit Pawar also raised doubts about technical aspects of the crash, including the aircraft’s black box and possible causes of the fire.“We had expressed doubts about the black box. When the accident happened, there was not just one blast, there were many blasts... VSR, the company that operates the flight, has a lot of issues. They are mechanical, maintenance issues. There is an area where bags are kept, additional petrol cans were kept there, and that's what caused the fire, so this needs to be investigated,” he said.Ajit Pawar and four others were killed on the morning of January 28 when the aircraft carrying them crashed near Baramati airport in Pune district while attempting to land. The Nationalist Congress Party (SP), along with Shiv Sena (UBT) and Congress leaders, have raised questions over the incident and suggested possible foul play.","Ncp (sp) general secretary rohit pawar wrote to prime minister narendra modi seeking the resignation of civil aviation minister k ram mohan naidu.
