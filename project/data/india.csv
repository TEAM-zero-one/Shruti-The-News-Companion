SIR sets Bengal's Muslim marriage register ringing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sir-sets-bengals-muslim-marriage-register-ringing/articleshow/125147109.cms,"Photo/ANI

KOLKATA: Minority-dominated districts in Bengal bordering Bangladesh are now witnessing an unusual trend - married Muslim couples, who read their vows under Islamic law, are rushing to register their marriages under Section 16 of Special Marriage Act, 1954. According to data accessed by TOI, 1,130 Muslim couples applied to register marriages in Bengal between Nov 2024 and Oct 2025.More than half these applications (609) were made between July and Oct, when Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls was underway in neighbouring Bihar. Bengal govt officials linked the spike over the four-month period to increasing anxiety over SIR.Many of these Muslim couples wanted to acquire an additional citizenship document in view of the impending SIR rollout in Bengal, officials at the Bengal Marriage Registrar General office said.Most of these applications were received from North Dinajpur (199) and Malda (197), which share their borders with Bihar, followed by Murshidabad (185) and Cooch Behar (97). All four districts also share their borders with Bangladesh. Kolkata was at the lower end of the data sheet with only 24 such applications. Jhargram (1) and Kalimpong (2) recorded the least number of such applications.According to sources, Muslim marriages in rural Bengal are usually conducted under The Bengal Muhammadan Marriages and Divorces Registration Act, 1876.For this, the state gives licences to Muhammadan Marriage and Divorce Registrars (MMRs), who are mostly kazis.""Marriage and divorce certificates issued by the kazis are legally valid, but lack uniformity, with MMRs following their personal formats. The address verification process is also vague. Due to this, multiple govt and private bodies do not accept these kazi-issued certificates as valid marriage documents. The certificates that are issued under Special Marriage Act, not only weed out such problems but are the most acceptable marriage document anywhere in India. These are also considered as citizenship proof in many cases,"" an officer said.Another senior official pointed out that marriage and divorce registrations for Muslims were so far done under the 1876 Act because the process was simpler, allowing individuals to quickly marry, divorce and remarry.""While polygamy is banned, because this Act vests a lot of power in the kazis, it can be manipulated to end a marriage quickly and allow remarriage, bypassing the rigours of legal scrutiny or court cases. The Special Marriage Act, however, is more stringent and allows only one marriage at a time,"" the official explained.","1,130 muslim couples applied to register marriages in bengal between nov 2024 and oct 2025.

SC relaxes rule on advance disclosure of arrest reasons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-relaxes-rule-on-advance-disclosure-of-arrest-reasons/articleshow/125147098.cms,"NEW DELHI: Carving out an important exception to a constitutional mandate that an accused must be informed in advance in writing about grounds of his arrest, Supreme Court Thursday that said in crimes like hit-and-run cases, police can inform him about grounds of arrest later but at least two hours prior to his production before a magistrate.This clarification came from a bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih on a plea filed by Mihir Rajesh Shah, who claimed his arrest in the BMW hit-and-run case of July 7, 2024, was illegal and unconstitutional as he was not informed about the grounds of his arrest prior to Mumbai police taking him into custody.Shah, allegedly under influence of alcohol, was accused of hitting a scooter, impact of which flung the man aside, but the pillion rider was caught under the bonnet and front wheel and dragged for quite a distance resulting in her death. Shah fled the scene without informing police. He had challenged the legality of arrest alleging that he was not informed about the reasons prior to arrest.The bench affirmed the fundamental right of every person to be informed about the grounds of his arrest and that non-communication would render the arrest illegal. It also said that it was the duty of the magistrate, before whom the accused is produced within 24 hours of arrest, to inquire whether the requirement of prior communication of grounds of arrest has been complied with.However, SC said, ""There may be situations wherein it may not be practically possible to supply such grounds of arrest to the arrested person at the time of his arrest or immediately... It may so happen that in the presence of a police officer a cognisable offence is being committed, and the factual matrix presents a tangible and imminent risk of the suspect absconding or committing further offence(s).""Writing the judgment, Justice Masih said, ""The constitutional safeguards, valuable as they are, cannot be interpreted in a manner to allow it to metamorphose into a procedural impediment that handicaps the law enforcing agencies in due lawful discharge of their duties."" A balance between constitutional mandate and effective discharge of responsibilities cast on police must be struck, the bench said. It said, ""We thus hold, that, in cases where the police are already in possession of documentary material furnishing a cogent basis for the arrest, the written grounds of arrest must be furnished to the arrestee on his arrest. """"However, in exceptional circumstances such as offences against body or property committed in flagrante delicto, where informing the grounds of arrest in writing on arrest is rendered impractical, it shall be sufficient for the police officer or other person making the arrest to orally convey the same to the person at the time of arrest,"" it said,SC said the grounds of arrest in such exceptional cases must be communicated to the accused at least two hours prior to his production before a magistrate to enable the lawyer of the accused to study the grounds of arrest and take appropriate steps in accordance with law.","Mihir rajesh shah claimed his arrest in the bmw hit-and-run case of july 7, 2024, was illegal and unconstitutional.

""Maybe we should say that the matter should be heard by a HC bench other than the one seized of it at present,"" the CJI observed, though he did not mention this in the short order.On July 28, the CJI-led bench had vacated HC stay on implementation of the new OBC list that had a total of 140 sub-groups under OBC-A and OBC-B categories, including 80 belonging to the Muslim community. SC had said that it is well settled that the Executive can notify such a list without passing legislation. The earlier list, which was struck down by HC, had 113 OBC sub-groups with 77 from the Muslim community and 36 from others.The state govt had expeditiously come out with a new list of OBC sub-groups after it was directed by SC to undertake a fresh recruitment process to fill 25,000 posts of teaching and non-teaching staff in govt schools. The earlier recruitment of teachers was quashed by HC with its order being upheld by SC.On a petition by one Amal Chandra Das challenging the new OBC list, an HC bench of Justices Tapabrata Chakraborty and Rajasekhar Mantha had on June 17 directed that executive notifications issued between May 8 and June 13 on OBC categories would not come into effect till July 31.","Supreme court asks calcutta high court not to proceed with the hearing of a pil challenging west bengal govt's new list of obc sub-groups.

Maharashtra Deputy CM Ajit Pawar’s 'How Dare You' Retort At IPS Officer Triggers Political Firestorm

PUNE: A major political row erupted in Maharashtra on Thursday over alleged transfer of a 40-acre 'Mahar Watan' land belonging to the state in Pune's Mundhwa area for Rs 300 crore in favour of Amadea Enterprises LLP, a company in which deputy CM Ajit Pawar's son Parth is one of two partners, prompting Mahayuti government to order a probe by a five-member committee and suspend a sub-registrar.The state allegedly waived stamp duty of Rs 21 crore payable for the sale deed registration done in May, alleged activists who claimed the land's market value was Rs 1,800 crore. CM Devendra Fadnavis said he has ordered an inquiry into the land deal. ""Prima facie the issue appears to be serious. I have asked for officials concerned from land records, IGR and other revenue offices to share all the details with me,"" he said.Govt has suspended sub-registrar Ravindra Taru from IGR's Haveli IV sub-registrar office on charges of ""gross irregularity in registering the sale deed and causing loss to the exchequer"". The IGR authorised joint district registrar (class I) and stamp duty collector Santosh Hingane to initiate criminal proceedings against Taru, Sheetal Tejwani (who held power of attorney for the land), and Amadea Enterprises LLP partner Digvijay Patil, named in the sale deed.Ajit distanced himself from the case. In a statement that further stirred the row, he said he had heard something like this 3-4 months ago and had warned against anything wrong being done. ""I had given clear directions that no one should do anything wrong. Directly, as Ajit Pawar, I have no connection with the case by far,"" he said.He also said when children grow up, they begin their own profession. He clarified the address of the company concerned was not his but that of his son, Parth. ""I have never contacted any official regarding favours to be done for my relatives. If anyone is using my name to do anything against the rules, I do not support it,"" Ajit said. He said ""the CM has the right to conduct an inquiry.""Supriya Sule of NCP (SP), however, defended her nephew, saying, ""I believe in Parth, he won't do anything wrong.""Pune district collector Jitendra Dudi told TOI, ""There has been an illegal transaction and necessary inquiry is being carried out.

‘NDA Will Form Govt Again Under Nitish Kumar’s Leadership’: Bihar Dy CM Vijay Sinha Ahead Of Polls

NEW DELHI: NDA is banking on its reinforced alliance and the appeal of its welfare measures in regions going to polls in Bihar on Thursday to turn the tide in its favour in areas where the Mahagathbandhan (MGB) had edged past it in the last assembly election.In 2020, RJD-led opposition had won 61 of the 121 seats that go to polls in the first phase, against NDA's 59, performing strongly in Shahabad region and key districts such as Patna, Bhojpur, Saran and Siwan.Back then, Chirag Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party and Upendra Kushwaha, who headed RLSP, had fought separately, helping MGB gain ground in several constituencies, including Begusarai and Buxar. With both Paswan and Kushwaha back in NDA, alliance netas now believe their social coalition has been significantly strengthened. They are also counting on the impact of the govt's welfare initiatives - notably the Rs 10,000 cash transfer to over 1.3 crore women - to sway the voters.In 50 seats across Patna, Bhojpur, Buxar, Saran, Siwan and Begusarai, MGB had bagged 35 in 2020. CPI-ML Liberation, with its strong base among the poor across caste lines, had played a crucial role in MGB's success.A BJP neta said the alliance expects a major recovery in these districts as well as in Magadh and Shahabad regions, where polling is scheduled in the second phase on Nov 11.Also read: Key constituencies, top candidates in phase 1 of Bihar elections Home minister Amit Shah's claim that NDA's tally will rise from 125 seats in 2020 to over 160 stems from confidence of improving its performance in regions that favoured MGB earlier, he added.In 2020, Paswan had walked out of NDA and had dented the alliance's vote base, particularly in seats contested byJDU, while Kushwaha's support was tepid. The return of both netas and the rise of deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary within BJP have boosted the morale of the Kushwaha community, the second-largest OBC bloc after Yadavs, comprising about 4.2% of Bihar's population.In the first phase, JDU is contesting 57 seats, BJ and other allies six, while RJD is fighting more than 70, Congress 24 and CPI-ML 14, with VIP, CPI and CPM also in fray.","In 2020, rjd-led opposition had won 61 of the 121 seats that go to polls in the first phase, against nda's 59.

NEW DELHI: Their plan was audacious, modus operandi professional and inspiration crystal clear. This group of alleged cyber criminals in the city weren't just running a con job, they were staging a real-life version of their favourite TV series, Money Heist, even taking on aliases from characters of the Netflix thriller.So, Arpit Mishra adopted the mantle of the cerebral mastermind of the series and was known to his gang as ""professor"". Working under him were key people executing crucial day-to-day operations. Prabhat Vajpayee, who holds a master's degree in computers and used to manage digital communications and perhaps the flow of illicit funds, used the alias, Amanda. Functioning alongside him was Abbas Khan aka Berlin, a core player ensuring the gang kept running smoothly.With the chilling precision of career criminals, the gang duped around 200 people of Rs 50 crore through a fake online trading scheme. According to special CP (law and order) Ravindra Yadav, the operation, code-named Direct Market Account, was an almost perfect digital deception.Posing as elite financial brokers, the syndicate used to lured the targets into their complex web, first securing their faith by making them part of an ""exclusive"" WhatsApp group that promised privileged market tips.""The setup was elaborate: a fake trading platform, phantom shares and the promise of massive returns — a perfect illusion created to secure maximum gains.

The Udanapalli police arrested Santhosh from Bengaluru. The police said Neelukumari had installed the camera in the bathroom as instructed by Santhosh.Vidiyal Residency has 11 floors and eight blocks, providing accommodation for more than 6,000 women. Four women were staying in each room. The camera was installed on Sunday (Nov 2) in the bathroom of a room occupied by women from northern states, said additional superintendent of police Shankar. Neelukumari was one of the occupants of that room. Other women staying in the room discovered the camera on Tuesday and reported it to the hostel management.The discovery of the camera created tensions among the hostel inmates.

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

Accommodated request twice, AG not being fair to court: CJI





NEW DELHI: Unaffected by the rebuke from Supreme Court for seeking reference of petitions challenging the validity of the Tribunal Reforms Act to a five-judge bench half-way through the final hearing in the matter, attorney general R Venkataramani made a fresh request for adjournment on Thursday, upsetting CJI B R Gavai, who wondered why the top law officer wasn't being direct enough to seek adjournment of the hearing beyond Nov 24, when a new CJI assumes office.Venkataramani, who had already been granted two adjournments to enable him to participate in an international arbitration proceeding, through ASG Aishwarya Bhati, requested the bench to adjourn the hearing scheduled for Friday to Monday.The CJI, who on Nov 3 had refused to accept the Centre’s application seeking reference of the case to a five-judge bench and termed it as an attempt to drag the matter beyond his retirement date of Nov 23, told Bhati that the AG is “not being fair to the court” despite the bench, also including Justices K Vinod Chandran and Vipul Pancholi, accommodating his request for adjournment twice in the past.“If you want to have the hearing after Nov 24 (when Justice Surya Kant takes over as CJI), you should frankly say that,” the CJI said, adding that “every now and then it is told to us that the AG is busy with international arbitration and yet the Centre comes out with a midnight application seeking reference of the case midway through the final hearing to a five-judge bench.”“We have highest regard for the office of the highest law officer.But when we were practising in HCs, we used to give up cases if we were engaged in a part-heard matter before any bench to enable the HC to complete the hearing as scheduled,” CJI remarked. Though the CJI reluctantly agreed to adjourn the case to Monday, he pointed out that the bench needed enough time to write the judgment. The petitions before SC challenged the provisions of the Tribunal Reforms Act which put in place a uniform tenure of four years for the chairperson and members of different tribunals, even though SC had ruled that the tenure should be of five years.On Nov 3, the bench had said, “We did not expect the Union govt to indulge in such tactics. After we have heard the petitioners fully, the Union govt cannot be permitted to take the plea for reference to a larger bench.” However, it clarified that “if on consideration of the arguments, we arrive at a conclusion that the matter involves substantial questions of law requiring reference to a 5-J bench, we will do so”.","Attorney general r venkataramani made a fresh request for adjournment on thursday.

KOLKATA: West Bengal government on Thursday made it mandatory for all government and govt-aided schools to sing the state song, 'Banglar Mati, Banglar Jal', at morning assemblies.

Brazilian Model 'Sweety' Surfaces Online, Reacts to Rahul Gandhi's Electoral Fraud Charge in Haryana

NEW DELHI: Opposition parties on Wednesday accused BJP leaders of voting in more than one state, calling it “proof of vote theft.”The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), and Congress claimed that RSS ideologue Rakesh Sinha had voted in both the Delhi and Bihar elections.Sharing screenshots of Sinha’s posts, which showed him voting in the Delhi Assembly elections on 5 February 2025 and again in the Bihar Assembly elections on Thursday, AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj wrote on X: “Rakesh Sinha voted in the Delhi Assembly elections and again in the Bihar elections today. He teaches at Delhi University’s Motilal Nehru College, so how can he claim an address in Bihar? Do you think the BJP will reform if caught stealing? Not at all; they will continue to do it openly. Even today, fake monitoring continues at the AQI stations.”The opposition also alleged that BJP Delhi Purvanchal Morcha president Santosh Ojha and party worker Nagendra Kumar were among those who voted in both Delhi and Bihar.Rakesh Sinha dismissed the allegations, saying he had shifted his voter registration from Delhi to his village in Bihar, and warned that he would file a defamation suit against the accusationsTaking to X, Sinha said, “I never imagined politics could fall to such a low level. Those questioning the faith of people who respect the constitution should think a hundred times before speaking.

What is the Pune land deal controversy?

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Thursday distanced himself from the Pune land deal controversy involving a company linked to his son Parth Pawar, saying he has ""no connection"" with the issue and ""won’t tolerate any wrongdoing. ""Speaking to reporters in Mumbai, Pawar said, ""I am not even remotely connected to this (land deal). I only want to say that whatever reports are being run are not known to me. I have no connection with the issue. I had already clarified that I will not tolerate any wrongdoing. I will analyse the details of the case personally. I have never called any officer to benefit any of our relatives or any party worker.""He further said that, ""If anyone is doing wrong or against the set norms, I will never support them. I wish to make clear to officers that I won’t support any wrong actions by anyone citing my name to get their work done.""""When your children grow up, they do their own business,"" the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president added.The state government has formed an inquiry committee to probe the alleged irregularities in the Rs 300 crore land deal involving Amadea Enterprises, a company linked to Parth Pawar.Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has appointed Additional Chief Secretary (Revenue) Vikas Kharge to head the probe panel.The government also suspended a tehsildar and a sub-registrar in connection with the case after the Opposition claimed that land worth Rs 1,800 crore was sold to the firm for just Rs 300 crore.Fadnavis, earlier speaking to reporters in Nagpur, said, ""Prime facie, the issue looks serious. I've sought all information concerning the case from the relevant departments. Orders have been given to conduct a probe.""""The CM should definitely inquire into the matter and find the truth behind it. All the rules should be followed, and no one should flout the rules. Even those close to me are not allowed to surpass the rules,"" Pawar said.According to officials, 40 acres of government-owned Mahar watan land in Pune’s upscale Mundhwa area were sold to a private firm, Amadea Enterprises LLP, for Rs 300 crore, a deal now under scrutiny for alleged ""irregularities"". Officials noted that as the land is government property, it cannot legally be sold to a private entity.According to PTI, Inspector General of Registration Ravindra Binwade said the high-level committee will examine how the transaction was cleared. ""The committee will find out how government land was sold to a private firm and whether the exemption was given as per norms,"" Binwade said.""The documents submitted to claim the exemption will be checked. The committee will see what sort of documents were produced during registration. But as an immediate action, we have suspended a sub-registrar-rank official. If it is government land, the registration should not have taken place,"" he added.Sources in the revenue department said the 7/12 extract, a key property record, lists the land in the name of ‘Mumbai Sarkar’ (Government of Maharashtra). Besides Parth Pawar, Digvijay Patil, in whose name the registration was done, is also listed as a co-partner in Amadea Enterprises.According to the IGR office order, the sub-registrar (Taru) should have ensured that a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) from the competent authority was attached before registering the property. In this case, the registration was done without an NOC, resulting in ""serious irregularities.""The order further noted that the document was registered for just Rs 500, availing the stamp duty exemption. While some exemptions may apply, the order said a 2% levy—comprising 1% local body cess and 1% metro cess, amounting to about Rs 6 crore—""cannot be waived,"" leading to a loss to the state exchequer.Ajit Pawar has reiterated that he is ""not remotely connected"" to the land transaction, while Parth Pawar, who shares partnership in Amadea Enterprises with Digvijay Patil, has not yet commented on the allegations.","Ajit pawar says he has ""no connection"" with the issue and ""won't tolerate any wrongdoing"" the state government has formed an inquiry committee to probe the alleged irregularities in the rs 300 crore land deal involving a company linked to his son parth pawar.

‘NDA Will Form Govt Again Under Nitish Kumar’s Leadership’: Bihar Dy CM Vijay Sinha Ahead Of Polls

Caste arithmetic in Gaura Bauram

Estimated blocs:

VIP counts on consolidation in the end

A peculiar contest has emerged in Darbhanga’s Gaura Bauram constituency. Amid uncertainty and confusion during seat-sharing within the Mahagathbandhan, RJD had initially allotted the ticket to Afzal Ali Khan. Later, the seat was handed over to Mukesh Sahni’s VIP. Sahni then fielded his younger brother Santosh Sahni from here but Afzal Ali refused to withdraw. Treating this as indiscipline, RJD yesterday expelled Afzal Ali for six years with immediate effect.This sets up a potential split in the Muslim vote between Afzal Ali and Santosh Sahni, this could end up benefiting the BJP.BJP has fielded former IRS officer Sujeet Kumar Singh. His wife Swarna Singh had won from here in the previous election on VIP’s ticket, but later joined BJP. The seat has a sizeable Mallah population, the reason Mukesh Sahni had originally demanded it for himself but eventually nominated his younger brother.RJD insists that Santosh Sahni is the authorised Mahagathbandhan candidate. But on paper, Afzal Ali continues to remain the nominated nominee — something that could complicate Santosh’s prospects. Afzal Ali had lost by barely 7,000 votes the last time when he contested on RJD’s ticket.2.65 lakhMuslim 70k, Yadav 28k, Mallah 26k, Brahmin 33k, Vaishya 20k, Paswan 15k, other SC 25k.BJP’s Sujeet Kumar Singh is from the Rajput community, which is not numerically dominant here. However, he believes he can ride on the BJP’s core vote base plus Mahagathbandhan’s internal rebellion.Speaking to us, he claimed that barring Muslims, every caste group is voting for me. He also claimed a large chunk of Yadavs are backing him. Singh resigned from the IRS only a week before receiving the BJP ticket and believes his “education and clean image” will work as an added advantage.VIP spokesperson Dev Jyoti said within 24 hours of Afzal Ali’s expulsion, the “wind has swung” in VIP’s favour. He expressed confidence that Muslim voters, at the end of the day, will back the candidate best placed to defeat the BJP. He also said the backing of Lalu Prasad Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav is firmly with VIP here.However, some minority voters argue that since RJD had already issued the nomination earlier, Mukesh Sahni shouldn’t have disturbed the seat.","Bjp has fielded former irs officer sujeet kumar singh.

Ladakh Statehood Violence: BJP Blames Congress While Sonam Wangchuk Says Gen-Z Led The Protests

SRINAGAR: A judicial commission set up by Union home ministry to probe the September 24 violence in Leh Thursday said it was not getting a “good response” from the public, and appealed to the people to come forward and depose before it.Addressing a press conference in Leh, IAS officer Tushar Anand, administrative secretary of the inquiry commission, said, “The greater the number of people submitting evidence, the more impartial the investigation will be and that will help ensure justice.”Ananad, who was accompanied by Rigzin Spalgon, joint secretary for the panel, said it would not be possible to conduct a fair inquiry if people did not come forward. “We won’t get information on our own. People must step up and share whatever they know so that we can examine the evidence and make a proper decision,” he said.He said officials and ground-level staff posted at the site during the incident were being identified and once their list was prepared, they would have to depose before the commission. “But, many people may have seen what happened. If they come forward, it will help the inquiry,” he added.The ministry of home affairs announced the commission on Oct 17 after Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), the two major political organisations in the Union Territory of Ladakh, demanded a judicial probe headed by a retired Supreme Court judge as a precondition for resuming dialogue with the Centre.The inquiry commission, chaired by retired SC judge Justice B S Chauhan, began its work on Oct 27 and a day later, issued a public notice inviting people to share information related to the Sept 24 incident. The evidence can be submitted till Nov 28, after which the commission will start its hearing.When asked about reports that some people were allegedly forced by security forces to delete their videos and were now afraid to share evidence, the official said: “Even if the videos have been deleted, people can still submit written statements explaining that they were forced to delete them.” “Anyone having information, whether in video, written, or oral form, can submit it through an affidavit,” he added.On Sept 24, police and paramilitary forces allegedly opened fire on protesters demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh, after demonstrations turned violent, killing four people and injuring more than 90. Subsequently, more than 70 people, including climate activist Sonam Wangchuk, were arrested.After the announcement of the judicial probe, the Centre held talks with representatives of LAB and KDA on Oct 22 in New Delhi. The two organisations had pulled out from the scheduled talks after the violence.","A judicial commission set up by union home ministry to probe the september 24 violence in leh said it was not getting a ‘good response’ from the public.

Reveal all convictions or face disqualification: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/reveal-all-convictions-or-face-disqualification-sc/articleshow/125141997.cms,"If there is non-disclosure of a previous conviction by a candidate, a voter is deprived of making an informed and advised choice, SC said

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that non-disclosure of conviction in a minor offence, even if overturned by higher courts, in a nomination form would lead to disqualification of an elected candidate as the law mandating revealing criminal antecedents operates in full rigour irrespective of the nature of the crime.Poonam was unseated from the municipal councillor's post in Nagar Parishad, Bhikangaon, Madhya Pradesh, as she was convicted in a cheque bounce case and sentenced to one year imprisonment with a direction to pay compensation.She had failed to mention her conviction in the nomination form. Poonam claimed that her conviction was set aside by a higher court and hence her election could not be set aside because of a conviction that no longer existed.A bench of Justices P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar rejected the petitioner's plea to save her from disqualification as non-mention of conviction in a cheque bounce case, which is a not a serious crime or touches upon moral turpitude, would not materially affect the election.Writing the judgment, Justice Chandurkar said, ""Once it is found that there has been non-disclosure of a previous conviction by a candidate, it creates an impediment in the free exercise of electoral right by a voter.A voter is thus deprived of making an informed and advised choice. It would be a case of suppression/non-disclosure by such a candidate, which renders the election void.""The bench said non-furnishing of information pertaining to criminal antecedents has the effect of causing undue influence, which creates an impediment in the free exercise of electoral right by a voter.The court said it was clear that by failing to disclose her conviction under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, the petitioner suppressed material information and thus failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of Rule 24-A (1) of the Madhya Pradesh Nagar Palika Nirvachan Niyam, 1994.""Acceptance of her nomination form has therefore been rightly held to be improper. She being the returned candidate, her election was rendered void. It is thus obvious that on account of such wrongful acceptance of her nomination form, the election was materially affected,"" it said, while noting that Poonam had contested the bypoll for the councillor post, which fell vacant because of her disqualification, and lost.","If there is non-disclosure of a previous conviction by a candidate, a voter is deprived of making an informed and advised choice, sc said.

'BIG ZERO': PM Modi Takes Massive Dig At RJD, Cong's 'Jungle Raj' Report Card for Bihar in Araria

Violence, accusations and counter-claims

The firsts of Bihar elections

Record turnouts

Campaigns pick up more heat



NEW DELHI: The first phase of the Bihar assembly elections on Thursday recorded the state’s highest-ever voter turnout, with 64.66 per cent of 3.75 crore electors exercising their franchise across 121 constituencies.The Election Commission said polling concluded peacefully “in a festive mood with the highest-ever voter turnout of 64.66 per cent in the history of Bihar”. Bihar's chief electoral officer Vinod Singh Gunjiyal said women voters participated in large numbers with “a lot of enthusiasm”.Several prominent leaders, including Yadav, deputy chief ministers Samrat Choudhary and Vijay Kumar Sinha, and a number of ministers, were among the 1,314 candidates contesting in this phase.Stray incidents were reported during polling, including an alleged attack on a vehicle in deputy Vijay Kumar Sinha’s convoy. Sinha, seeking a fourth consecutive term from Lakhisarai, alleged that RJD supporters tried to “intimidate” extremely backward class voters.Sinha lashed out at the Lakhisarai Superintendent of Police (SP) and demanded the deployment of a ""special force"" after his convoy was attacked by people he claimed were supporters of the opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD).He also had a heated verbal spat with RJD MLC Ajay Kumar. The two leaders were seen hurling abuses at each other as their convoys came face-to-face. As the RJD MLC accused Sinha of being a ""criminal"", alleging that he was trying to intimidate voters, Sinha hit back, calling Kumar a ""failed leader"" and ""drunk."" The latter dismissed the ""drunk"" charge, saying that it was ""Mahua"" (local liquor).On the other hand, the RJD alleged on X that voting had been “deliberately slowed down” in areas where the INDIA bloc is believed to have strong support. The Election Commission rejected the accusation.At the Manjhi assembly constituency in the Saran district, a vehicle of CPM candidate Dr Satyendra Yadav, representing the Grand Alliance, was attacked by miscreants during the first phase of polling. The attack resulted in the shattering of his SUV's windows, creating a chaotic atmosphere in the area. The incident occurred in Jaitpur village under Daudpur police station area, while Yadav was on a tour of his constituency.A notable feature of this election was the presence of Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Party. Kishor has promised to make Bihar “among the top-ranking ones in the country” and has said he intends to scrap the prohibition law, arguing that it has weakened the state’s resources.For the first time, there was live webcasting of polling in 100% of the polling stations, with chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar and election commissioners S S Sandhu and Vivek Joshi monitoring the feed from the EC control room here. The CEC engaged with the presiding officers and district election officers from the control room to ensure the smooth progress of polling.Another first in this election was the visit of 16 foreign delegates from six countries to Bihar as part of the international election visitors' programme (IEVP), to witness the poll proceedings . The delegates, EC said, hailed the Bihar elections for being one of the most well-organised, transparent, efficient and participative elections, internationally. Over 90,000 'jeevika didis' or female volunteers were deployed to assist the polling personnel in identifying the 'purdahnasheen' (veiled) women electors.The presiding officers updated the voter turnout figures at the close of poll before leaving the polling station, cutting the delay in updation of approximate voter turnout trends. Earlier these figures would land till as late as 11.30 pm on polling day.The Bihar polls witnessed use of colour photos of candidates on EVM ballot papers.In another first, electors could deposit their mobiles at the polling stations. Modified voter information slips ensured easy readability. Given that the voters per polling station was capped at 1200, voting could proceed without any long queues and extra waiting times.Polling took place across 18 districts. Muzaffarpur recorded the highest turnout at 70.96 per cent, followed by Samastipur at 70.63 per cent.Madhepura recorded 67.21 per cent, Vaishali 67.37 per cent, Saharsa 66.84 per cent, Khagaria 66.36 per cent, Lakhisarai 65.05 per cent, Munger 60.40 per cent, Siwan 60.31 per cent, Nalanda 58.91 per cent, and Patna 57.93 per cent. Lower turnout in urban Patna was attributed to areas such as Bankipur, Digha, and Kumhrar.According to the Election Commission, the state’s lowest turnout was 42.6 per cent in the 1951-52 assembly polls, while the previous highest was 62.57 per cent in 2000. The turnout stood at 57.29 per cent in 2020, 56.91 per cent in 2015, and 52.73 per cent in 2010.As the campaign moves into its final phase, caste and community loyalties continue to play a decisive role, with Yadavs, Kushwahas, Kurmis, Brahmins, and Dalits shaping outcomes in several constituencies.The NDA is banking on chief minister Nitish Kumar’s governance record and recent welfare measures such as 125 units of free electricity, Rs 10,000 cash transfers to more than one crore women, and an increase in social security pensions.The opposition countered that voters were ready for change. RJD president Lalu Prasad posted on X, “If a roti is not flipped on a tawa (pan), it gets burnt. Twenty years is a long time. A Tejashwi government is essential to build a new Bihar.”During campaign events for the second phase, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the high female turnout signalled support for the ruling alliance.“Mothers, daughters, and sisters have been the worst sufferers of 'jungle raj'. Today, they seem to have put up a fortress around polling booths to prevent the return of 'jungle raj',” PM Modi said.The polls, conducted after the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls that opposition parties criticised for alleged “rigging” and “manipulation”, are being viewed as an early indicator of political sentiment ahead of 2029.The NDA, which has held power in the state for two decades except for brief intervals, is highlighting its record of “sushasan” (good governance). The opposition INDIA bloc is relying on anti-incumbency and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav’s “jobs-for-every-home” promise to mount its challenge.The second and final phase will take place on November 11, and the counting will be held on November 14.","The first phase of the bihar assembly elections on thursday recorded the state’s highest-ever voter turnout, with 64.66 per cent of 3.75 crore electors exercising their franchise across 121 constituencies.
