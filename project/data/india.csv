He who fails to guard against calamities beforehand will repent, too late,

When disaster strikes

The wordcan be traced back to the Spanish ‘, an uproar. Yet, what it leaves behind is never noise; but silence, of those who lose their kin in the crush of humanity.History has recorded such incidents too often. In AD 80, Josephus wrote of Passover pilgrims in Jerusalem. A soldier’s taunt, a moment’s panic, and thousands were trampled into death. Since then, the list has grown: Mecca Tunnel, Mina, Baghdad Bridge, Kumbh Mela, New Delhi Railway Station, Bangalore’s RCB rally, Pushpa II’s premiere in Hyderabad—and now, Karur, where more than 40 lives were snuffed out, some of them children. What began as a gathering of hope became that of despair. The patterns are cruelly familiar: crowds underestimated or dismissed, brittle barricades, packed paths, first responders unable to reach the fallen.Unanswered questions linger. Why was a narrow venue chosen for a rally that all locals knew could not hold such a crowd? Why did the leader arrive late? Were miscreants planted to unleash chaos? None of these questions find easy answers. But each whispers of carelessness that borders on disrespect for life itself.German physicist Dirk Helbing once coined the term. When there are more than six bodies in every square meter, even the slightest motion unleashes a shock wave. At that moment, people are pushed, pulled, and crushed like twigs. To survive, experts advise: move with the crowd, place your arms around your chest to avoid breaking of your ribcage by pressure, avoid walls and do not scream as you have to conserve oxygen, stay upright as much as possible. But what of the children of Karur? Could they shield their tiny chests? Could they ‘flow’ with the sea of bodies? No instruction manual can answer their shrill cries, now frozen in our memories.And the cycle repeats. Each time, organizers and authorities play their parts in the tragedy; grief is turned into blame, inquiries, and eventual forgetting.But the families who watched their children disappear in the chaos will never forget. Their silence will remain an open wound.In the corporate world, there is a practice called a. Before any launch, be it product, marketing or event, a group brainstorms on all that could go wrong, lists down what would be the worst that can happen and then mitigation is planned. What if our leaders, event organizers, and police, practiced this? What if duty meant not afterthoughts but foresight?Thiruvalluvar, with timeless clarity, had already given us the warning in—Do not neglect your duties:The verse is not just a counsel; it is a mirror. Every stampede reflects our failure to heed it. Karur is not merely an accident—it is an indictment of negligence, of blindness to the obvious.The cries beneath the crowd may be hushed, but they will not vanish. They ask us, relentlessly: will we continue to learn nothing, or will we at least listen to wisdom that has echoed for centuries?","Thirukkural is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality.

National Medical Commission (NMC) is yet to act against 30 doctors found guilty of accepting a foreign trip funded by pharma company AbbVie as the matter is still “under consideration”. An audit committee of the department of pharmaceuticals had in Dec last year found them guilty, and their names were sent in July to the commission for action.New chairperson of NMC, Dr Abhijat Sheth, confirmed to TOI that matters pending before the Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB) could not be taken up. Four out of five posts in the board, including that of its president, are vacant.Speaking to TOI, Sheth said NMC was considering constituting a temporary board of NMC members to take up matters pending before EMRB. “Since this (the charge against 30 doctors) is a serious matter, it will be taken up as soon as possible,” he said. “Govt has reassured us that the vacant posts will be filled up soon. Until then, there is little we can do. We are aware that a lot of matters are pending,” said Sheth, who added he was out of the country and would be back by Oct 12.Of the four autonomous boards in NMC, EMRB, which deals with regulation of the medical profession, has only one part-time member, Dr Surinder Pal Singh, from Punjab Medical Council, who was appointed in July.Many of the posts have been vacant for more than one year though the NMC Act stipulates that three months before the end of a member’s tenure, the matter must be referred to a search committee for filling up the vacancy. NMC had issued a circular inviting applicants for the vacant posts in 2023 and again in Aug 2024.The list of 30 doctors has not been made public by the department of pharmaceuticals though its audit committee and later apex committee had found them guilty of accepting foreign vacations to Monaco and Paris funded by AbbVie. Despite the apex committee stating in Dec 2024 that NMC should be requested to take action against the guilty doctors, the department had failed to forward the names of the doctors to NMC till July.","Nmc yet to act against 30 doctors found guilty of accepting foreign trip funded by pharma company abbvie.

NEW DELHI: The Bangladesh interim govt has failed to maintain law and order in the country and is looking to shift blame elsewhere for its failure to protect minorities, the govt said on Friday. The ministry of external affairs (MEA) was responding to allegations by Dhaka that India fuelled the recent unrest in the Khagrachhari district.“We categorically reject these false and baseless allegations. The interim govt, which is unable to maintain law and order in Bangladesh, has routinely sought to shift the blame elsewhere,” said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.“It would do well to introspect and conduct serious investigations into the action of local extremists committing violence, arson and land grab against the minority communities in the Chittagong Hill Tracts,” Jaiswal added.Bangladesh’s home adviser Jahangir Alam Chowdhury had claimed that “certain quarters” were attempting to inflame communal tensions during the Durga Puja festival. According to reports from Dhaka, at least three people were killed and dozens injured on Sunday as clashes erupted in parts of the southeastern Bangladesh hills between aboriginal tribesmen and the settler Bengali community over the alleged gang rape of a tribal girl.The police confirmed the deaths of three men without elaborating on their identities, while residents and witnesses said both feuding sides turned violent, setting ablaze each other’s businesses and households in Khagrachhari hill district, approximately 270km northeast of Dhaka on the motorway, according to a PTI report. The clashes occurred following the alleged gang rape of the eighth-grade schoolgirl in Khagrachhari district on Tuesday, one of the three hill districts of Chittagong Hill Tracts bordering India and Myanmar.","The bangladesh interim govt is looking to shift blame elsewhere for its failure to protect minorities, the govt said on friday.

NEW DELHI: A scuffle broke out between ABVP and Left-affiliated outfits and charges and counter-charges were traded in JNU over a Ravan Dahan and a Durga immersion on Thursday.The Leftist outfits alleged that an effigy of former students Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam - who are facing trial in a 2020 Delhi riots case - along with Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru, was burnt during a Ravan Dahan. They accused ABVP of communal propaganda.

Poll Do you agree with the Delhi high court's ruling on personal use of luxury items? Agree Disagree





NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court recently clarified that a single Rolex watch cannot be deemed a commercial quantity and allowed the redemption of the detained item, while emphasising caution in future adjudications.A division bench of Justices Pratibha M Singh and Sahil Jain was hearing a petition challenging an order passed by the office of the Commissioner of Customs, IGI Airport , New Delhi, regarding the detention and proposed confiscation of a Rolex watch belonging to a Dubai resident.The bench observed that while the order by the Customs Commissioner correctly allowed redemption of the detained goods, it erred in concluding that a single Rolex watch constituted a commercial quantity.The court said, “Clearly, this Court is of the view that one Rolex watch cannot be held to be a commercial quantity, and there is no reason why the same cannot be kept for personal use.”The petitioner, a Dubai resident, had travelled to India and, upon arrival at the airport, his single Rolex watch was detained for alleged non-declaration.He approached the high court, challenging the order—particularly the classification of a single watch as a commercial quantity—and sought clarity on the redemption procedure.Counsel for the petitioner argued that a single Rolex watch could not be considered a commercial quantity and could legitimately be kept for personal use.The petitioner requested the court to allow redemption without dispute over the personal use claim, while upholding the payment of the previously imposed redemption fine.Highlighting the need for careful adjudication, the court allowed the petition, directing the petitioner to pay the redemption fine by October 31 and redeem the detained Rolex watch in accordance with the original order.","The delhi high court recently clarified that a single rolex watch cannot be deemed a commercial quantity.

CHENNAI: Criticising actor-politician Vijay and his Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) members for first causing a stampede that killed 41 people in Karur on Sept 27, and then abandoning their cadres and followers, Madras HC ordered a probe by an SIT Friday.Citing two accidents involving Vijay’s campaign vehicle, which did not stop even after dashing against the bikes of his accompanying cadres, HC also ordered registration of a hit-and-run case against the politician. “Both the driver and the leader (Vijay) saw the accident but left the place without stopping... This court highly condemns the attitude of the party (TVK)... There was not even a remote sense of feeling expressed by the party taking responsibility for organising such an event. This only shows the mental state of the leader and the party,” Justice N Senthilkumar said.“The SIT will be headed by Asra Garg, IGP (north zone), and comprise Vimala, SP, Namakkal, & Shyamaladevi, SP. Garg is at liberty to select additional members under any category/designation as he deems fit,” said the judge. All CCTV footage from place of the incident, and in particular footage inside and outside the bus carrying the head of the political party, shall be seized.The bus involved shall also be seized, the court said.“In both cases (campaign vehicle hitting two bikes), police have not registered an FIR for hit-and-run. Court expresses its deep anguish and agony that even if no complaint is filed by the aggrieved, state has suo motu responsibility to register a case, bring the perpetrators of the crime on record, and make them face trial,” Justice Senthilkumar said.“Neither the politician nor his followers were there at the scene of occurrence after the incident. The President, the PM, Union home minister, CM of Tamil Nadu , and leader of opposition condoled the incident. This court could not understand how the political party that organised the rally abandoned the scene of occurrence immediately after the incident,” the judge said.“Unfortunately, the organisers, right from the leader... vanished, leaving their own cadres, leaving their own followers, leaving their own fans in the lurch,” the judge said, adding, “Such irresponsible attitude of any politician or organisation can’t be taken lightly. Court owes its responsibility towards its citizens. It is unfortunate to record such leadership quality.”Court prohibited political rallies, roadshows and similar public events along state and national highways in the state until standard operating procedures were formulated.HC also dismissed the anticipatory bail petitions of two TVK members, state general secretary Bussy N Anand and deputy general secretary CTR Nirmal Kumar, who have been named in the FIR in connection with the incident.","Madras hc ordered a probe by an sit friday.

Shaikh told TOI over phone that the allegations were baseless. “I will challenge my dismissal in court,” he said.Police registered an FIR under Prevention of Corruption Act, and BNS provisions against Nikam and two others for allegedly demanding Rs 5 lakh bribe from a woman for releasing on bail her father, who was in judicial custody in a cheating case.Nikam moved HC for anticipatory bail. HC, while denying him pre-arrest bail, said, “We have perused the probe papers and, the alleged conversation between Nikam and the complainant. There is a sufficient incriminating material against the applicant to connect him with the crime in question.”“This conduct of the applicant, prima facie, corroborates prosecution case.

NEW DELHI: Prashant Kishor , election strategist-turned-politician and the founder of Jan Suraaj Party, has triggered a political storm in poll-bound Bihar with his explosive corruption allegations against several state leaders. Interestingly, Prashant Kishor, who has often been accused by opposition parties of helping the BJP, has unleashed his tirade against the members of ruling NDA in the state. His targets till now include Bihar's deputy chief minister Samrat Choudhary, ministers Ashok Choudhary, Mangal Pandey and BJP MP Sanjay Jaiswal.The Jun Suraaj chief has levelled serious allegations against these leaders. The charges against BJP leader and deputy CM Samrat Choudhary include:Minister Ashok Choudhary, whom Prashant Kishor has called ""Bihar’s most corrupt leader"", has been accused of:The leaders in question have denied the charges, but Prashant Kishor has claimed he has papers to prove his allegations against them. The BJP's Bihar unit launched a counter-offensive against Prashant Kishor describing his Jan Suraaj party as ""a political startup based on fraud"". The state BJP has accused PK of raising ""hundreds of crores of rupees"" through ""shell companies"".BJP's state media in-charge Danish Iqbal accused Kishor with indirectly helping the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and asked, ""Why is his party is still receiving funds from states ruled by INDIA bloc parties which had sought his professional help during elections.""""More than Rs 370 crore have come from West Bengal where he had worked for Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress in 2021 assembly polls. Besides, Kishor is getting huge funds from states like Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka,"" he alleged.Responding to these charges, Prashant Kishor has dared the NDA leaders to unleash investigative agencies against him. ""The Union home minister and the Prime Minister are from the BJP, let them send investigative agencies to probe charges against me,"" the Jan Suraaj chief said. The Jan Suraaj chief also shared details of his finances to counter funding charges against him and his party.Interestingly, the top BJP leadership has maintained a silence on Prashant Kishor's allegations. Political analyst NK Choudhary feels that the BJP does not want to give credence to PK's allegations by opening a front against him.""For the BJP, the principal opponent in the state as of now remains Lalu and his party the RJD, so they are focussed in their attacks on them. Prashant Kishor has managed to gain a lot of traction, support and also media attention but he is still far away from emerging as the principal challenger to the BJP politically. Any counter action or reaction to Prashant Kishor now would give credence to his allegations and that is perhaps why the top BJP leadership is not reacting to his campaign,"" NK Choudhary says.However, he has a word of caution for the BJP insofar Prashant Kishor's attacks against Nitish Kumar are concerned. ""Nitish Kumar remains the best bet for BJP in Bihar. The electoral gains that NDA makes in Bihar is courtesy the strong image of Prime Minister Modi and the popularity of chief minister Nitish Kumar. If any campaign weakens the chief minister, the NDA as a whole may suffer electorally.""Now, this could be a tricky proposition for the BJP leadership, which may want its own chief minister in the state after playing second fiddle to Nitish Kumar for nearly two decades. In the 2020 elections, the saffron party for the first time became the senior partner in the state alliance winning 75 seats. But the BJP allowed Nitish Kumar, whose party was reduced to 45 seats in the assembly, to continue as the chief minister.However, that may change this time around if the BJP manages to repeat or better its performance. As the NDA partners gear up for the upcoming assembly elections, the top BJP leadership has been reluctant to announce that the next government will be formed under Nitish Kumar. For now, the BJP leaders say that they will contest the elections under Nitish Kumar, which is quite natural as the JDU chief is the chief minister of the coalition government.By levelling corruption allegations against Ashok Choudhary, who is viewed as the right-hand man of Nitish Kumar, Prashant Kishor may be actually piling pressure on the chief minister, who anyway is battling reports of his ill health. Nitish, whose clean image has always stood him in good stead electorally, stands to suffer if a leader of his party and who is perceived very close to him is accused of corruption.Little wonder, the JD(U) immediately swung into action to defend Nitish Kumar. “Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has redefined politics with his honesty and integrity throughout his 20-year tenure. No one has been born who can prove even a single allegation of corruption against him. Those who have been accused of graft should respond. Nitish Kumar is equal to 'Zero Tolerance',” JD(U) chief spokesperson Neeraj Kumar posted on social media a day after after Kishor levelled allegations against Ashok Choudhary.The Jan Suraaj Party has dropped enough hints that it will take these allegations to their logical conclusion. It has submitted a memorandum to the Bihar governor seeking the removal of Samrat Choudhary. Party's national president Uday Singh and Bihar unit chief Manoj Bharti said they have also written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who claims to be a firm believer in probity in public life. ""We have no hopes from the Nitish Kumar government in the state. If no action is taken by the PM or the Governor, we will move the court as a last resort,"" the Jan Suraaj Party leaders have warned.Clearly, Prashant Kishor has made the Bihar elections interesting by highlighting corruption cases against leaders of the ruling combine. There is a strong possibility that in the run up to elections, he could be targeting more leaders, perhaps from the Mahagathbandhan also. So, the suspense over who is next in his line of fire is unlikely to end anytime soon.(With inputs from agencies)","Prashant kishor, the founder of jan suraaj party, has triggered a political storm in poll-bound bihar.

Rs 23k crore lost in 2024

Poll Have you or someone you know ever fallen victim to online investment fraud? Yes No

Some transactions layered via ‘fake import of services’

NEW DELHI: Its promoters are based in Russia, technical support in Georgia, its India operations are handled from Dubai and the servers are in Barcelona.Illegal online trading platform OctaFX, which is being investigated by ED for laundering thousands of crores of rupees from India to tax havens over the past few years, has become part of a unique study by the agency into transcontinental operations that convert proceeds of crime into cryptocurrencies and use services of international payment gateways.A multi-agency probe has revealed that OctaFX, which deals in forex, commodities and cryptocurrencies and is incorporated in Cyprus, made Rs 800 crore of alleged proceeds of crime from its India operations in just nine months.Some of the transactions were layered through “fake import of services” from Singapore to launder duped funds generated in India.In a particular case, ED has attached Rs 172 crore worth of assets in India and abroad, including a yacht, a villa in Spain, Rs 36 crore in banks, 39,000 cryptocurrency (USDT), land and Demat holdings of Rs 80 crore.OctaFX, being investigated by the ED’s Mumbai zonal unit, is not the only illegal online platform indulging in investment frauds. The others under probe include Power Bank, being investigated by the Bengaluru zonal unit; Angel One, TM Traders and Vivan Li, being investigated by the Kolkata zonal unit; and Zara FX, being investigated by the Kochi unit. The ED’s cases are based on several FIRs registered by police in different cities.“Cyber frauds in the name of cryptocurrency included Birfa IT and related firms acting as brokers, converting huge amounts of money to and from crypto to help clients send money to China for under-invoiced imports, laundering the PoC (proceeds of crime) through cryptocurrency,” the ED study revealed. The probe further found that in the Birfa case “remittances of Rs 4,818 crore were sent to Hong Kong and Canadian entities controlled by scammers, under the pretext of paying for leasing servers, escrow services, etc” on fake invoices.The ED document estimated that Indians have lost more than Rs 22,800 crore in around 36.4 lakh financial frauds reported in 2024 — a more than 206% jump in estimated losses from Rs 7,465 crore in 2023 and an over 50% jump in number of cases from 24.4 lakh in that year.Investigation against a similar cyber investment fraud found that the masterminds, operating from Laos, Hong Kong and Thailand, hired agents in India to set up shell entities using forged documents and issued fake IPO allotments, stock market investments and indulged in fake digital arrests.PoC was collected in shell companies, converted into cryptocurrencies and remitted overseas as payment for fake “import of services”.While international payment gateways act as intermediaries for many of these illegal transactions, a part of the booty is laundered using hawala channels. In some cases, Enforcement Directorate has found PoC are brought back to India “disguised as legitimate investments” into stock markets.",Illegal online trading platform octafx is being investigated by ed for laundering thousands of crores of rupees from india to tax havens over the past few years.

'Not cantaminated'

No contamination found in 9 of 19 cough syrups: Govt

Rajasthan halts supply of all 19 Kaysans meds

BHOPAL/JAIPUR: Alarm bells are ringing over the deaths of 12 children in MP and Rajasthan following complications after use of cough syrups, prompting the Centre to issue an advisory on Friday against prescribing cold and cough medications to children aged below 2.The advisory to all states and UTs by Directorate General of Health Services came even as the Union health ministry claimed that none of samples picked up from MP contained diethylene glycol or ethylene glycol — toxins known to cause severe kidney damage. The samples were collected after there were reports linking the deaths of children from renal failure to consumption of contaminated cough syrups.With the Centre ruling out contamination in the cough syrup samples from MP, the mystery over the cause of kidney failure in children continues. Nine children have died in Chhindwara district over a month, while five are undergoing specialised treatment in Nagpur in neighbouring Maharashtra, said district collector Harendra Narayan Singh.Following deaths of children who consumend cough syrups, Union health ministry claimed that none of samples picked up from MP contained diethylene glycol or ethylene glycol — toxins known to cause severe kidney damage.The suspected link between the deaths and cough syrup had earlier prompted the district administration to impose a ban on two brands as a precaution. Dr Sanjay Mishra, joint director, health services, told TOI that the stock with a Jabalpur distributor, who was supplying the suspected cough syrups, had been sealed.State officials said lab tests of nine out of 19 samples, collected by ICMR and state teams, have shown no signs of contamination, but the report of 10 samples, which include two medicines whose sale has been prohibited for now in Chhindwara, are yet to be received. Authorities are awaiting detailed forensic and biochemical analysis before reaching a final conclusion.The cases, first reported in late Aug, were largely concentrated in Parasia and surrounding villages in the district. Children, mostly under the age of five, initially showed symptoms of cold and mild fever. They were administered cough syrup along with routine medicines. Within days, their condition worsened with reduced urine output and subsequent kidney-related complications.In Rajasthan, three deaths have been reported in the past one week, with many other children developing complications after taking a cough syrup distributed under the state govt’s free medicine scheme. The state health department denies the deaths were linked to the dextromethorphan-based formulation, even though it has banned the syrup’s distribution/sale pending test results and a formal investigation by a three-member committee.While a five-year-old boy died in Sikar district on Sept 29 after his condition deteriorated upon taking the cough syrup, another death was reported from Bharatpur. At least five other children in the two districts also reported similar symptoms — vomiting, drowsiness, anxiety, dizziness, restlessness and unconsciousness.The third case has been reported from Weir town in Bharatpur district, where a two-and-a-half-year-old died on Sep 27 at Jaipur’s JK Lone Hospital. He had been prescribed Amodroxol cough syrup.While the family alleges that their child died after consuming the cough syrup, a fact-finding report by Bharatpur’s chief medical officer says the boy had a previous history of febrile seizures — a convulsive event that accompanies fever and viral infections in children aged between 6 months and five years.The health department is also investigating reports of at children in Banswara reporting complications after consuming cough syrup, between Sept 16 and Sept 30.Since 2012, a total of 10,119 samples of medicines manufactured by Jaipur-based Kaysans Pharma, which supplied the dextromethorphan-based cough syrup that has been blamed for three deaths, have been subjected to quality test, of which 42 have been found to be sub-standard, Rajasthan Medical Services Corporation Limited’s managing director Pukhraj Sen revealed on Friday.As a precaution, the state health department has stopped the supply of all 19 types of medicines being provided by this company until further orders.",Rajasthan halts supply of all 19 kaysans meds. 12 children have died in mp and rajasthan following complications after use of cough syrups.

‘Nice person’ asked my 13-yr-old daughter during online game to send nude photos: Akshay Kumar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nice-person-asked-my-13-yr-old-daughter-during-online-game-to-send-nude-photos-akshay-kumar/articleshow/124298311.cms,"ANI photo

MUMBAI: Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar recounted on Friday how his 13-year-old daughter, Nitara, dealt with sexual harassment while gaming online.A few months ago, while playing an online game that allowed strangers to interact, she was befriended by someone who initially engaged her with friendly messages.“The person started with polite messages like ‘thank you’, ‘well played’, and ‘fantastic’. He seemed like a nice person. After some time, he asked if she was male or female, and when she replied ‘female’, the tone of the conversation changed,” Kumar said. The stranger asked his daughter to send him nude pictures of herself.“My daughter immediately shut down the game and informed my wife. Thankfully, she didn’t hesitate to share what happened,” the actor said, speaking at the inauguration of Cybersecurity Awareness Month at the Maharashtra Police headquarters.The actor said the incident reflects a cybercrime pattern where predators first build trust and then attempt to exploit minors — a modus operandi that often ends in extortion and in tragic cases, suicide.CM Devendra Fadnavis emphasised the importance of reporting cybercrime on helplines 1930 and 1945 within the Golden Hour — which is the hour immediately after the crime has occurred. This, he said, is crucial in cases of cyber fraud, as it improved the odds of recovering stolen money.He said the state plans to raise awareness among school and college students on cybercrime. Fadnavis launched two resources that will be used in this awareness campaign — a documentary on cyber security and a comic book for children called ‘Cyber Warrior’.Fadnavis said the state needed to enhance capabilities to counter deepfakes. He said fraudsters use AI to trick people through phishing, OTP scams, deepfakes, voice and face cloning. “We share personal information on social media and through online transactions and payment platforms. Once cookies are accepted, personal data can be misused, leading to fraud, extortion and cyberbullying,” he said.Also present at the ceremony were actor Rani Mukerji , VJTI dean of R&D and consultancy Dr Farooq Kazi, associate professor at IIT Bombay Manjesh Hanawal, and IAS and IPS officers. Activists working to raise awareness on cybercrime were felicitated.","Bollywood actor akshay kumar recounted on friday how his 13-year-old daughter, nitara, dealt with sexual harassment while gaming online.

GUWAHATI: With four arrests so far, the Assam Police SIT escalating charges from negligence to potential murder, and international cooperation underway, Zubeen Garg’s death is no longer just about a tragic accident, it is evolving into a multi-jurisdictional criminal investigation.Gauhati HC has now agreed to state govt’s request to form a judicial commission head ed by a sitting HC judge. Assam CM Himanta Sarma said the judicial panel, to be headed by Justice Soumitra Saikia, will be formed on Saturday.

Fans and civil society are pushing for transparency and accountability. Sarma Friday launched a counter-offensive against what he called a “coordinated conspiracy” to malign the govt using Zubeen’s legacy. “When he was alive, you didn’t invite him to perform in your areas. You brought Mumtaz from Bangladesh. ”Meanwhile, Zubeen’s drummer Shekhar Goswami & co-singer Amritprabha Mahanta, who were arrested by SIT Thursday, were sent to 14 days custody.","Gauhati hc has agreed to state govt’s request to form a judicial commission head ed by a sitting hc judge.

RAIPUR: Chhattisgarh High Court has termed right to a dignified death and cremation an intrinsic part of the fundamental right to life enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution. The observation came Monday in response to a PIL registered suo motu by division bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Sinha and Justice Bibhu Datta Guru over poor state of Muktidham (cremation ground) in Bilaspur’s Rahngi gram panchayat. The pronouncement followed the CJ’s visit to the site for a funeral on Sept 28 when he found the facility in a “pathetic condition”.The bench said a body “deserves a respectable send-off” and the State had a constitutional obligation to provide decent conditions at public funeral facilities. Failure to do so amounted to an abdication of duty. The CJ found several glaring deficiencies, including absence of fencing to demarcate the area, lack of proper road, no sanitation, lighting, shed, or seating for mourners and absence of caretaker, signboard, or helpline.The bench issued an 11-point directive and asked administration to immediately undertake corrective measures, including comprehensive cleaning drives at all cremation/funeral grounds, fencing, installation of water, electricity, toilets, shelters, and seating, provision of firewood/LPG, and functional electric/gas crematoria. HC asked panchayat and social welfare department secretary, chief secretary, and Bilaspur collector to file personal affidavits on state’s roadmap for improving cremation grounds. Next hearing is on Oct 13.",Chhattisgarh high court has termed right to a dignified death and cremation an intrinsic part of the fundamental right to life enshrined under article 21 of the constitution.

JAIPUR: Rajasthan HC Thursday ordered the commercial taxes department to release within seven days the full salary and arrears of one of its officers who has been without pay for over a year since slipping into a coma in Aug 2023.HC passed the order after hearing a plea by the officer’s wife. The petitioner’s counsel said the officer, Surendra Singh Chawra from Bhilwara, had been appointed to the department in 2006. He went on to become an assistant commercial tax officer, Pratapgarh circle, after several promotions.“On Aug 7, 2023, he suffered a brain haemorrhage and underwent surgery. He slipped into a coma soon after and remains in that state to this day,” the petitioner’s counsel told HC. The department paid Chawra’s salary for a year after the mishap, until Aug 2024, against pending leaves and other administrative entitlements. Following this, the salary was stopped, and he was classified as “on leave without pay”, the counsel added.Chawra was the sole breadwinner of his family, which included his wife, two kids, and parents, the counsel told HC. Concerned about the family’ plight, a single-judge bench of Justice Ravi Chiraniya told the dept to clear any administrative hurdles in the process of releasing Chawra’s salary.“If one month’s salary is not paid, the whole family suffers adversely. In this case, the employee is in a coma, and the family also faces heavy medical expenses. How will they survive in such circumstances?” the judge asked. “...Since Diwali is ahead, ensure outstanding payment in this case in next 7 days”, the HC order read.","Hc passed the order after hearing a plea by the officer’s wife.
