Uttarkashi Cloudburst Horror: Flash Floods Sweep Away Village, People Seen Running For Their Lives

DEHRADUN/HALDWANI/ALMORA/RUDRAPUR: In Uttarakhand, each monsoon brings devastation-roads wash away, homes collapse, and there is widespread destruction. This year, the monsoons have been particularly harsh, as the disasters at Dharali, Tharali, Harsil and Syanachatti show. Amid this annual havoc, children are among the most vulnerable, forced to study in crumbling govt schools despite crores being sanctioned for repairs year after year. Most recently, a tranche of Rs 20 crore was released for this purpose, yet the reality on the ground remains bleak.For many children, the classroom has become less a place of learning and more a daily struggle for safety-amid collapsing walls, leaking roofs, and the threat of wild animals straying in. Education minister Dhan Singh Rawat, taking cognisance of the issue, recently directed repairs to be completed by March 2026, allotting Rs 2 crore each to seven districts and Rs 1 crore each to the rest six. But state-watchers say this is nowhere close to what's required and the estimated cost for repairs exceeds Rs 72 crore. ""We've received proposals from nearly 1,400 schools. We are sending the remaining demand to the govt.Repairing these schools and ensuring safety is a priority,"" said Mukul Sati, director of secondary education.In Dehradun, officials admit that 227 primary and 44 secondary schools require urgent repair. In Sinyali, the boundary wall of a school was washed away in heavy rain, leaving the premises exposed. In Chukkhuwala, parents have been raising alarm about their local intercollege. ""The ceiling here has cracks. Each downpour weakens it further. We worry for our children's safety,"" said Amit Verma, a parent.In Udham Singh Nagar, 55 schools have officially been declared dilapidated. In Kashipur block, nine schools shifted classes to anganwadi centres and makeshift premises after rainwater poured through cracked roofs and walls. In Jaspur's Rajkiya Primary School, nearly three feet of water flooded the campus during a recent spell of rain, forcing children to wade through water to reach classrooms. A primary school in Maldevta, on the outskirts of Doon, damaged in the 2022 tragedy, is yet to see repairs.(Inputs by Tanmayee Tyagi in Dehradun, Sonali Mishra in Haldwani, Aakash Ahuja in US Nagar, and Yogesh Nagarkoti in Almora)","In uttarakhand, children are among the most vulnerable, forced to study in crumbling schools.

KOLKATA: A four-year-old boy headed to Malaysia for a holiday with his family on Aug 12 was attacked by a Customs dog at Kolkata airport resulting in deep scratches on his back and leading to his hospitalisation. The family had to scuttle its trip and on Aug 19 lodged an FIR with NSCBI airport police station against the dog handler.The child, Anav Jain, is now undergoing a treatment protocol that requires five doses of immunisation administered over 28 days.The dog, a four-year-old female Alsatian named Nancy, was trained for narcotics detection at the Customs Canine Centre at Attari, airport sources said.

NEW DELHI: The Dharmasthala mass burial case in Karnataka took an unexpected turn on Saturday after the special investigation team arrested the complainant and witness Chinnaiah after ""inconsistencies"" were found in his statements and documents during questioning.He was earlier referred to as the 'masked man' as he had kept his identity hidden while seeking protection as a witness in the alleged crimes.""It is true that he has been arrested and is in police custody. As the investigation is on, no information can be shared. The police (SIT) investigation is on, and they have arrested him. SIT will share the details,"" Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara told reporters.She has since made contradictory statements, reportedly saying she never had a daughter and that a false complaint was filed at the instigation of others. She later retracted that statement as well.Meanwhile, a woman named Sujata Bhat backtracked on her claim that her daughter had gone missing in Dharmasthala. She had claimed that daughter, Ananya Bhat, apparently an MBBS student, had gone missing.The case stems from the allegations of multiple murders, rapes, and burials across different places in Dharmasthala over the past two decades.The complainant Chinnaiah, a former sanitation worker, claimed he worked in Dharmasthala between 1995 and 2014 and was forced to bury several bodies, including those of women and minors.In his written complaint, he claimed that he had recently returned to one of the burial sites and exhumed skeletal remains, photographs of which were submitted to the authorities.He alleged that some of the bodies bore signs of sexual assault and had recorded a statement before a magistrate.The government, then instructed the police that all criminal cases related to the matter—reported or anticipated—in police stations across Karnataka be transferred to the SIT.According to Parameshwara, the SIT id likely to continue its investigation based on the statements given by the complainant.Asked whether there was a network behind the complainant, Parameshwara said, ""It has to be identified whether there was any network or not. Once the probe report comes, it will be known.""To a question on why narcoanalysis of the complainant, suggested by Dakshina Kannada police a month ago, was delayed, the minister said, ""once the case was handed over to SIT, the government will not give directions on how the investigation should happen.

"Administration cancels land lease of Sonam Wangchuk’s HIAL, activist terms it ‘attack on Ladakh’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/administration-cancels-land-lease-of-sonam-wangchuks-hial-activist-terms-it-attack-on-ladakh/articleshow/123477350.cms,"SRINAGAR: The Ladakh administration ’s move to cancel the land allotment of Himalayan Institute of Alternative Learning (HIAL), founded by environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk , has led to sharp criticism from the region’s two biggest political movements --- Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA).“We believe this is a witch hunt. It seems like a conspiracy to harass and intimidate people,” LAB representatives said at a press conference in Leh. “Sonam Wangchuk is very vocal about the rights of the people of Ladakh at national and international level. We see this as an attempt to silence the voices of Ladakh one by one. But we will not be scared. All leadership stands with him.”Wangchuk, on his part, termed the administration’s move as an attack on Ladakh itself. “It is not an attack on Sonam Wangchuk, but on Ladakh. It is an attack on the Leh Apex Body and the Kargil Democratic Alliance,” he said.LAB and KDA, formed in 2020, represent political and religious groups from Leh and Kargil. Both have been demanding statehood for Ladakh and inclusion of the region under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution.Since the abrogation of Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019, and the bifurcation of the J&K state into the two UTs — J&K and Ladakh — the Ladakh region has witnessed a series of political agitations for the Sixth Schedule and statehood.Wangchuk has led several such protests, holding long fasts and long marches.On Jan 2, 2023, the ministry of home affairs set up a high-powered committee to address key issues in Ladakh, including the Sixth Schedule. The last round of talks, between the Centre’s high-powered committee and the Ladakhi leaders was held on May 27, leading to the introduction of a domicile policy.On Aug 11, LAB and KDA launched a three-day protest in Kargil, led by Wangchuk, demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh.On Aug 21, Leh deputy commissioner Romil Singh Donk issued an order stating that the land measuring 1,076 kanal and 1 marla (over 53.8 hectares) allotted to HIAL “stands escheated to the State, i.e., LAHDC (Leh Autonomous Hill Development Council)”, and directed the Leh tehsildar to “remove all the encumbrances from the said piece of state land as per provisions of the law, and effect entries in the revenue record accordingly”.The order said the land in Phyang was given to HIAL on lease for 40 years, but it has not been used for the purpose allotted, “as no university (as recognised by law) has been set up” to date.Wangchuk, while talking to reporters, said HIAL was created in 2018 with the support of Ladakh leaders after the success of the “ice stupa” project, which was aimed at addressing Ladakh’s water crisis. “The land was leased to the HIAL under unanimous consensus of Ladakhi leaders. It is a charitable company, not my personal university,” Wangchuk said. “The allotment was given in 2018, and now, suddenly, the Ladakh administration says it is not serving its purpose. ”He said 400 students have passed out from HIAL. “The cancellation of the land lease at this juncture, when Ladakhi leaders are seeking safeguards for the region, shows a design. HIAL is the pride of not just Ladakh but of the whole Himalayas,” he added.",Ladakh administration cancels land allotment of himalayan institute of alternative learning.

The relentless downpour has prompted swift action from the Army and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), who have been actively conducting relief operations in Kota.Meanwhile, the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) has been evacuating residents from other severely affected areas, ensuring their safety amidst the rising waters.In a bid to assess the extent of the damage and coordinate further relief efforts, Disaster Relief Minister Kirodi Meena, accompanied by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, is set to conduct an aerial survey of the affected regions in the Kota division on Saturday.Their visit underscores the gravity of the situation and the government's commitment to addressing the crisis. The Meteorological Department has reported that Bundi's Nainwa received an unprecedented 502 mm of rainfall in the past 24 hours, marking it as the highest in the region.This deluge has led to significant waterlogging in several districts, including Bundi, Kota, Sawai Madhopur, Karauli, and Jaipur, with rainfall exceeding 10 cm by Saturday morning. In response to the ongoing threat, a red alert has been issued for Bhilwara and Chittorgarh, warning of extremely heavy rainfall, while an orange alert remains in place for Bundi, Kota, Pali, Rajsamand, Udaipur, Dungarpur, Banswara, Jalore, and Sirohi.In Tonk district, the SDRF and civil defense teams have successfully rescued over 100 individuals from a village in Niwai’s Banasthali, which was submerged under water. District officials, including Collector Kalpana Agrawal and SP Rajesh Meena, have been on the ground, assessing the situation and coordinating relief efforts.","A 200-foot-long wall collapsed in amer fort in jaipur on saturday amid heavy rains.

"Despite opposition, J&K government assumes control of 215 Jamaat-linked schools",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/despite-opposition-jk-government-assumes-control-of-215-jamaat-linked-schools/articleshow/123477366.cms,"A security official stands guard outside a school at Wanabal Rawalpora, in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir.

SRINAGAR: A day after ordering the takeover of schools allegedly run by the banned Jamaat-e-Islami’s (JeI) educational organisation, Falah-e-Aam Trust (FAT), Jammu and Kashmir government moved swiftly on Saturday to enforce the directive despite opposition from all political parties, except BJP. A senior official said the principals of nearby government schools, backed by police and revenue staff, asserted administrative authority in all 215 JeI-linked schools across Kashmir.On Friday evening, J&K education secretary stated in its order directing the takeover that 215 schools had been identified by “intelligence agencies” that were “found to be directly or indirectly affiliated with proscribed organisation Jamaat-e-Islami (Jel)”.Former chief minister and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti condemned the decision, saying Kashmiris voted the National Conference (NC) to office in the 2024 assembly elections to safeguard their interests, but the party has instead targeted schools that provided quality education in J&K.Her daughter Iltija Mufti said every time NC got a brute majority in J&K, their first target has always been the Jamaat-e-Islami. “Be it 1977 or even today, where they have taken it too far by jeopardising the future of thousands of students, leaving them in distress,” she said.Education minister Sakina Itoo defended the decision, saying the state had not taken over the schools but directed principals of nearby govt schools to “look after” them for three months, after which the order would be reviewed. She said her proposal was altered by the administrative secretary, who inserted “deputy commissioner” and “take over” in the order instead of “nearest principal” and “look after.” The order would be corrected, she said.Administrative secretary Ram Niwas Sharma did not respond to calls for comment.I too stressed that the decision was taken to safeguard the interests of the students and teachers. Intelligence agencies had given an adverse report on these schools eight years ago, leading to their deregistration. The latest order, she said, was meant to ensure that 55,000 students of these schools continue their education and teachers remain employed.Rejecting the criticism of political opponents, she said: “Where were they all these eight years when students and teachers of these schools were suffering because of deregistration?”Responding to the minister’s statement, PDP legislator Waheed Parra challenged her to “come clean and make her original proposal public for everyone to see”. Peoples Conference, Apni Party and Awami Ittehad Party also condemned the govt move.BJP, however, welcomed the decision to assume control of Jamaat schools. Altaf Thakur, the party’s J&K spokesman, called it a “much-needed intervention to ensure that young minds are shielded from separatist narratives”. It was “a bold decision”, Thakur said, alleging that these schools were a source of “separatism and terrorism” in J&K.The central govt had banned JeI in Feb 2019 under UAPA and declared it an unlawful association. Since then, authorities have carried out several crackdowns against the group.However, in last year’s assembly elections in J&K, several candidates affiliated with JeI contested under the banner of the Justice and Development Front (JDF), indicating the group’s return to electoral politics after a 35-year poll boycott. The JDF has now aligned with Sajad Lone’s Peoples Conference.","Jammu and kashmir government moved swiftly on saturday to enforce the directive despite opposition from all political parties, except bjp.

BHOPAL: A 27-year-old MP lawyer and civil judge aspirant's desperation to escape family pressure to get married led her to meticulously plan a cross-border escape from Itarsi to Nepal's Kathmandu, dodging CCTVs, toll booths and police checkpoints to ensure she didn't leave any trail leading to the life of obscurity she desired.The 13-day search for Archana Tiwari - involving multiple teams from police, GRP and NDRF - culminated Wednesday in Nepal authorities confirming that an Indian woman found living incognito in Kathmandu matched the profile of the young lawyer reported missing by her family after boarding the Indore-Katni Narmada Express on Aug 7.Investigators said her circuitous escape route took her from Itarsi, where she got off the train with an acquaintance, to Kathmandu via Shujalpur, Indore, Hyderabad, Jodhpur, Delhi and then the UP-Nepal border.Her discarded bag had been found in the B3 coach of the train, leading her brother to file a complaint with GRP Katni on Aug 8, the day after Rakshabandhan.Police said they scanned footage from over 500 CCTV cameras, deployed NDRF personnel to scour a forested patch from Barkheda to Budni, and sent divers to search a 32-km stretch of the Narmada. The breakthrough came when investigators pored through her call records.""The name Saransh Jokchand popped up during the scan. Then one thing led to another,"" an officer said. Investigators found out that Saransh travelled with Archana by the Narmada Express and carried clothes for her to change into before getting into a pre-arranged taxi.Tejinder Singh helped the lawyer avoid being captured on surveillance cameras as he was familiar with areas of the railway station outside CCTV coverage. Archana had stopped using her mobile phones before her disappearing act, police said. She handed one of her phones to Tejinder, instructing him to activate it near Midghat and then discard it.Saransh's interrogation gave police enough clues to reconstruct her escape route. ""Being a lawyer, she knew that a missing person case lodged with GRP usually doesn't get pursued aggressively. She was probably convinced the trail would go cold, little knowing that the case would get the media attention it did,"" SP (railways) Rahul Lodha said.Police found out Archana had turned down at least five marriage proposals in recent months.

MUMBAI: Having registered a case against industrialist Anil Ambani on Thursday, CBI on Saturday carried out searches at his Cuffe Parade residence and Reliance Communications premises in connection with an alleged bank fraud that caused a loss of over Rs 2,929 crore to SBI.Sources said Ambani, promoter of the company, along with his wife Tina and their children, were at home when a team of CBI officials from Delhi arrived early Saturday. The searches concluded around afternoon.In its complaint to CBI, SBI had stated that the fraud came to light when a forensic auditor appointed by it submitted a report in Oct 2020, covering the examination period between April 2013 and March 2017.A spokesperson for Ambani denied the allegations and said the industrialist was ""selectively singled out"".CBI issued a press release stating that the accused persons, in criminal conspiracy, misrepresented and obtained sanctioned credit facilities from SBI in favour of Reliance Communication Ltd.By these acts, the accused persons are accused of committing offences of criminal conspiracy, cheating and criminal breach of trust, the CBI press release said. Ambani will duly defend himself, his spokesperson said, adding it is an over 10-year-old matter.The SBI in its complaint said the fraud took place in Mumbai. The accused persons or company, in conspiracy with each other and unknown others, obtained credit facilities from SBI by misrepresentation and deception, it stated. After disbursal, the accused misappropriated the funds by entering into transactions in violation of terms and conditions of sanction of credit facilities. Afterwards, the loans turned NPA.The spokesperson said, ""At the relevant time, Ambani was a non-executive director of the company, with no involvement in the day-to-day management. It is pertinent to note that SBI, by its own order, has already withdrawn proceedings against five other non-executive directors. Despite this, Ambani has been selectively singled out.""In its statement , CBI said that the allegations pertain to misutilisation/diversion of loan funds, potential routing of loan funds, inter-company loan transactions, misutilisation of sales invoice financing, discounting of bills of RCom by Reliance Infratel Ltd (RITL), movement of funds through inter-corporate deposits, write-off of capital advances given to Netizen Engineering Pvt Ltd (a group company of Reliance ADA Group), and creation/write-off of fictitious debtors, etc.The SBI complaint stated that in 2023, during the process of fraud identification of the account, show-cause notices were issued to the borrower and its promoters/directors to provide an opportunity for a hearing. Based on the response submitted by directors/promoters of the company, the account was classified as fraud in June 2025. While explaining the fraud, the forensic audit mentioned an instance of preference shares.On April 1, 2013, Rs 1,347.7 crore were receivable from Reliance Telecom Ltd (RTL) in the books of Reliance Infratel Ltd (RITL). RTL issued preference shares worth Rs 1,347.7 crore to RITL in satisfaction of the receivable amount on March 31, 2014. RITL sold these shares to another related company RCTNL on the same day for Rs 260 crore, thereby incurring a loss of Rs 1,087.7 crore. RCTNL received Rs 260 crore from RTL through RCom and paid the same to RITL for purchase of preference shares of RTL.","Cbi carried out searches at anil ambani's cuffe parade residence and reliance communications premises in connection with an alleged bank fraud.

Among Congress CMs turning up for the roadshow are Karnataka's Siddaramaiah, Telangana's Revanth Reddy and Himachal's Sukhwinder Sukhu. MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will be part of the yatra for two days on Aug 26 and 27.The roadshow designed to take forward opposition's offensive of ""vote chori"" came after a rare unity in anti- BJP ranks which even led to a washout of proceedings in the just-concluded Monsoon session of Parliament. The participation of non-Congress stalwarts is seen as a fillip for the agenda which would also send out a message to BJP.Given that Bihar assembly polls will be announced after a few weeks, RJD and Congress also hope that it would boost the profile of the anti-BJP alliance and provide further traction with the people ahead of the tough contest.",Voter adhikar yatra of rahul gandhi-tejashwi yadav is set to become a show of opposition unity.

While TMC's boycott was expected, SP's decision has increased pressure on Congress to follow suit in interest of opposition unity.SP's decision to align with TMC has triggered unease in the opposition camp. Now, even Congress ranks are unsure about the party's final stance, wondering if the leadership will be forced to change its position for the sake of unity. Until now, Congress has been heavily tilted in favour of joining the panel.TMC MP Derek O'Brien said, ""The Modi coalition pushing to form this JPC to examine an 'unconstitutional bill' is a stunt performed to create a distraction from SIR. Someone needed to call a stunt a stunt. I am glad we did.""""SP stands with Mamata Banerjee and TMC on the issue of not being a part of JPC,"" SP chief Akhilesh Yadav told TOI Saturday. He said, ""The very idea of the bill is flawed because the person who has moved the bill (home minister Shah) had, on several occasions in the past, cited his own case to claim that he was falsely implicated in criminal cases. It means anyone can be framed for criminal offences. So, what is the point of the bill then?""Yadav said this also explained how SP netas like Azam Khan, Ramakant Yadav and Irfan Solanki had landed behind bars.Claiming the bills clash with India's federal set-up, he added, ""Like it has happened in UP, CMs will be able to withdraw criminal cases filed against them in their respective states and Centre will have no control because law and order is primarily a state subject. Centre will only be able to handle cases filed by central agencies like CBI, ED and the likes. ""Interestingly, while questioning futility of the present JPC - which will be headed by a BJP MP and have a majority of NDA alliance members - O'Brien cited panels from the past formed by Congress govts on Harshad Mehta scam and Bofors case, even pointing to the allegation that ""a Congress member had taken a bribe"" for the Bofors guns.He argued JPCs were once conceived as well-intentioned mechanisms with exceptional powers to ensure public accountability. ""However, this purpose has eroded significantly post-2014, with JPCs increasingly manipulated by the govt in office... procedures are bypassed, opposition amendments rejected, and meaningful debate replaced by partisan fluff.""Though the opposition was bracing for TMC's boycott, other parties were ready to join the JPC, arguing deliberations in parliamentary panels carry weight in court hearings and shape public opinion on controversial legislations. SP's decision to stay away, however, has triggered uncertainty in opposition ranks as it weakens the collective voice against the bills.","Sp's decision to align with tmc has triggered unease in the opposition camp.

PATNA: Diwakar Sharma remembers the past two elections clearly. His wife Deepti voted both times without trouble. Now her name has disappeared from the electoral roll, and the couple has just a week to prove she still belongs.Across Bihar, thousands are scrambling to reclaim their place on the rolls before the Sept 1 deadline - a race against time that began when SC Friday opened a narrow window for those struck off during the SIR. Voters can now submit Aadhaar or one of 11 other approved documents, even online, to restore their names. The urgency is palpable in Ara, Bhojpur, Bettiah - wherever one goes.""The BLO (booth-level officer) told me what SC has just said, but he's waiting for written orders,"" Sharma, a 35-year-old priest in West Champaran, told TOI on Saturday.On paper, the ruling offers relief. On the ground, confusion is choking the process. Many deleted voters live in remote areas with limited internet access. BLOs, the backbone of the enrolment system, said they are yet to receive ""formal instructions"" on how to act. ""We cannot consider Aadhaar until EC issues an official order,"" said a BLO from East Champaran.Suchitra Sinha, a BLO from Bhojpur, warned that the timeline is too short.""Poll authorities should extend the deadline. It is difficult to collect Aadhaar from all excluded people within a week,"" she said. Without written orders from the chief electoral officer or district officials, BLOs fear their decisions could be challenged later.Frustration runs deep over political apathy, too. Electoral rules expect parties to deputise booth-level agents to help identify excluded voters and file claims. BLOs said support is scarce.""Hardly any BLAs are taking interest in submitting forms. Some are not even aware they have been appointed,"" said M Safir Ali, a BLO in Ara. Another BLO in Ara's Babu Bazar accused parties of ""raising noise but offering no assistance"".Politicians pushed back. ""Our party submitted nine claim forms in Bhojpur district alone till Aug 23 and has been consistently drawing attention to deletions,"" said CPI(ML)'s Chandan Kumar, an aide to Ara MP Sudama Prasad. Jan Suraaj's Ashok Manav said workers were assisting in all 14 blocks, but argued it was ""the prime responsibility of election officials to ensure not a single eligible voter is disenfranchised"".The scale of deletions is staggering. West Champaran saw 1,91,376 names removed, slashing the voter count to 25,69,614 from 27,60,990. Officials say 70,000 voters had shifted residences, while 20,000 names were duplicates.For people like Sharma and trader Dhananjay Soni in Valmikinagar, whose wife Ranjana also vanished from the rolls, the SC ruling has brought hope - but little clarity. ""One week remains,"" Soni said. ""Time is running out.""(With inputs from Praveen in Ara and Dilip in Bettiah)",Sc friday opened a narrow window for those struck off during the sir.
