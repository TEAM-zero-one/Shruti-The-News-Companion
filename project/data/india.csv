Raise strength of women judges: Ex-CJI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/raise-strength-of-women-judges-ex-cji/articleshow/123742116.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a sharp reminder to the SC Collegium and the Centre about gender diversity in constitutional courts, former CJI N V Ramana Saturday said making a noise about gender without giving proper representation to women in the constitutional courts would amount to nothing but tokenism.At a symposium at SRM School of Law, Justice Ramana said in the last 75 years, SC has had only 11 women judges, of whom three had taken oath four years ago on Aug 31, 2021, when he was the CJI. Of them twos have retired and the third one, Justice B V Nagarathna, will become first woman CJI in Sept 2027 for a very short period of 36 days. ""Our institutions must reflect our social fabric. Gender diversity and inclusivity is not tokenism. It is a necessity to enrich our perspectives with social realities. This issue needs a larger consideration. Inclusivity does not happen naturally... Bringing in inclusivity calls for concerted efforts at the highest level,"" he said.Justice Ramana highlighted how infrastructure issues had forced National Company Law Tribunal to issue a public notice on Sept 3 regarding the shutting down of three of its six courtrooms and said that during his tenure as CJI he had tried to persuade the govt and other stakeholders to create a National Judicial Infrastructure Authority to assess and supervise creation of adequate infrastructure for the three-tier justice delivery mechanism.The efforts did not fructify.The ex-CJI's plea for expeditious implementation of SC Collegium's recommendations for appointments to constitutional courts was taken forward by advocate A M Singhvi, who said for decades the HCs have been functioning with two-thirds of their sanctioned strength and the trial courts operate with four-fifths of their capacity of 25,000 judges.He said pendency of cases is directly linked to vacancy for judges in trial courts and HCs. Singhvi highlighted that govt and SC have worked out an MoP as per the law laid down by SC, which mandated govt has to expeditiously appoint candidates recommended by the SC Collegium.",Former cji n v ramana says sc has had only 11 women judges in 75 years. He said infrastructure issues had forced national company law tribunal to shut down three of its six courtrooms.

FATF lauds work of MHA's portal for international cooperation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fatf-lauds-work-of-mhas-portal-for-international-cooperation/articleshow/123742026.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Financial Action Task Force's (FATF's) latest report has appreciated the efforts of Union home ministry's online portal for Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) to standardise international cooperation on money laundering matters. The report also cited an investigation by ED into a darknet-based Fentanyl syndicate in its 'best practices' section, emphasising the significance of joint investigations.The joint probe by ED and US' department of justice (DOJ), it said, had led to the dismantling of a major drug trafficking organisation which was laundering proceeds through virtual assets. Elaborating on the case, it said that in 2022, DOJ had sought assistance from the Indian govt under the Treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance in criminal matters to investigate a major drug trafficking organisation led by two brothers.The investigation, according to FATF, revealed that the brothers controlled over 8,500 bitcoins, valued at $150 million at the time, which were used for money laundering and to finance drug trafficking activities. The organisation concealed these assets and its activities through complex transactions involving cryptocurrency exchanges and dark web platforms.Responding to the US' request, ED had launched a parallel investigation focused on the organisation's financial networks and obtained key financial records uncovering transfers, through a digital payment service provider, exceeding Rs 5.5 crore to the entity.In April and May 2024, searches led to seizure of 268.2 bitcoins, worth Rs 130 crore, which were frozen, along with the provisional attachment of assets worth Rs 9.6 crore.""This case is a strong example of real-time, cross-border co-ordination between the authorities of India and the US.

PATIALA: AAP MLA Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra has allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.According to Punjab Police sources, Pathanmajra and his accomplices fired at police officers during the escape and even ran over one personnel, leaving him injured.According to reports, Pathanmajra and his accomplices ran over police personnel with an SUV.The Sanour MLA was arrested a day after publicly criticising his party’s Delhi leadership.His detention in Patiala was linked to a rape case filed against him, sparking political uproar in the region.In a social media post, Pathanmajra claimed the case related to his former wife and alleged that the fresh charges of rape were politically motivated.“I was booked because I raised my voice against my own government, especially the Delhi leadership,” he wrote.His brother, Hardev Singh, said the MLA was taken into custody under Section 376 of the IPC despite already having been granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. “He was arrested from Dabri in Haryana in a case where bail was already granted. This is clearly an attempt to silence him,” he alleged.CIA Patiala confirmed that three weapons have been recovered and one accomplice of MLA Pathanmajra has been arrested.The arrested individual has been identified as Balwinder Singh, while the search for MLA Pathanmajra continues.Police said two officers were injured when stones were thrown at them during the MLA’s escape attempt.Authorities added that supporters of the MLA not only pelted stones but also opened fire at the police team.Before his arrest, Pathanmajra had appealed to colleagues and supporters via Facebook to protest outside the Patiala SSP’s office at the Mini Secretariat. He urged people to reach “in tractors, trolleys, and cars” to demand his release. “I will not be silenced even if more cases are registered against me. Will AAP’s Delhi leadership rule Punjabis now? Even Congress and BJP did not interfere to this extent,” he said.The MLA has repeatedly accused the party’s central leadership of sidelining Punjab leaders and “remote-controlling” the state. Recently, he criticised officials of the Irrigation Department over flood relief efforts in his constituency. Soon after, his security cover was withdrawn and police officers in the area were reshuffled — moves that raised eyebrows.“This is retaliation. They looted Punjab more than Abdali. Now they want to sell Punjab,” Pathanmajra declared.","Harmeet singh pathanmajra allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station.

MUMBAI: In one of the biggest drug seizures in the country this year, the Anti-Narcotics Cell and Crime Branch of the Mira-Bhayandar, Vasai-Virar police have busted a massive cartel operating through a chemical manufacturing factory in Telangana, seizing mephedrone (MD) worth an estimated Rs 12,000 crore.Mephedrone, also called “meow meow,” “meph,” “m-cat,” and “miaow,” is a synthetic stimulant belonging to the amphetamine group of drugs, which includes speed and ecstasy. According to sources, this is among the largest narcotics seizures in recent years.The probe began with the arrest of a 12 person including a foreign national and seizure of 100 grams of MD along with Rs 25 lakh in cash. Further interrogation revealed links to an interstate network engaged in large-scale production and supply of mephedrone. The investigation eventually led officers to Telangana, where the cartel was using a chemical factory as a cover for drug manufacturing.“In a bid to get to the roots of the factory, we infiltrated our men in the gang. After weeks of risky efforts, we were able to bust the cartel,” a senior officer said.The factory, located in the Cherlapally industrial area near Hyderabad and operating under the name Waghdevi Labs, appeared legitimate from the outside but was allegedly producing narcotics on a large scale.During the raid, police seized sophisticated chemical equipment, drug production units, and a massive cache of raw materials, including nearly 32,000 litres of precursor chemicals.The factory’s owner and chemical expert, Srinivas Valotty, along with associate Tanaji Pate, were taken into custody. In total, 12 persons have been arrested so far, including the foreign national caught in the initial operation.Police described the bust as a major blow to the narcotics supply chain across Maharashtra and other states. The factory has been sealed, and further raids are being conducted to trace the cartel’s wider distribution network.Commissioner of MBVV Niket Kaushik confirmed the drug seizure and said their investigation has led them to drug cartel to other states.","Mephedrone is a synthetic stimulant belonging to the amphetamine group of drugs, which includes speed and ecstasy.

He ordered that all the people suffering with unexplained illness should be admitted to hospital.Naidu conducted a review meeting on death of around 20 people in Turakapalem village in the past two months with unknown disease. He said health camps should be conducted in the village on Saturday and Sunday and medical tests should be conducted to all and prepare health profile of everyone.He advised the health officials to take the assistance of AIIMS Mangalagiri and if necessary international medical experts. He directed the officials to supply protected drinking water in the village. He made it clear no new case should be reported hereafter.""Officials should be vigilant 24X7 as there is a high possibility for the spread of the suspected bacterial disease through drinking water, food items, and through air.Meanwhile, the state govt constituted a high-level committee, led by Director of Secondary Health (DSH) Dr A Siri, to identify the officials responsible for failing to apprise higher authorities in time about the sudden spike in deaths in Turakapalem village.The committee will also make recommendations on measures to ensure that health department officials are immediately informed in case of a large number of deaths due to any illness in any region of the state in the future. This was announced by Health Minister Y Satya Kumar Yadav on Friday during his visit to Turakapalem village.Stating that stern action would be taken against all those officials for their inaction in reporting the deaths to the health authorities, Satya Kumar Yadav warned that no official will be spared and appropriate action will be taken against all the officials once the probe report is submitted by the high-level committee, which was ordered to complete in a week's time.Speaking to reporters, Satya Kumar Yadav said it is unfortunate on the part of the healthcare personnel working at the field level that they did not apprise the higher officials despite 23 people dying in the past two months. He said that the mean age of the deceased is 55, while around seven deceased were aged above 70 years.Dismissing media reports linking Melioidosis as the reason behind the deaths, the health minister said that the blood test reports have not confirmed the Melioidosis bacteria and that chemical and biological tests are also being done to determine the exact cause.The minister toured Turakapalem village, visiting the victims' households, enquiring about their health condition, and consoling the bereaved family members, besides taking a first-hand review of the medical services being provided to the villagers at the special medical camp set up in the village.Meanwhile, Guntur DMHO Dr Vijaya Lakshmi informed that the blood culture test results of the blood samples collected from individuals showing fever symptoms will arrive on Saturday.",Chief minister n chandrababu naidu on friday directed that health officials take a serious note on continuous deaths in turakapalem of guntur district.

Bihar SIR , controversy, and new measures



NEW DELHI: The Election Commission is set to meet on September 10 to discuss the preparedness of a pan-India rollout of special intensive revision (SIR) of voters' list, PTI reported citing officials. This comes as assembly elections in states like West Bengal, Kerala, Assam, Tamil Nadu, along with Puducherry are set to take place in 2026, indicating the possibility of SIR in these states by the year-end.The intensive revision aims to identify and remove illegal foreign migrants by verifying place of birth, a step gaining importance amid crackdowns on migrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar in several states. Meanwhile, the opposition has accused the Centre of targeting Bengali-speaking people across country, calling them illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.The revision of the voters’ list in Bihar drew criticism from opposition parties, who alleged that the exercise could disenfranchise crores of eligible citizens due to lack of proper documents.The Election Commission introduced additional measures in the ongoing intensive revision of electoral rolls to address concerns over the enrollment of illegal migrants. These steps came amid opposition allegations that the poll panel has manipulated voter data to favor the ruling party.As part of the new measures, an additional declaration form has been made mandatory for certain applicants, particularly those seeking to register as voters or shift their enrollment from outside the state. Applicants are required to declare that they were born in India before July 1, 1987, and furnish supporting documents to establish their date and place of birth.For those born between July 1, 1987, and December 2, 2004, the declaration process requires submission of documents proving the date and place of birth of their parents. These safeguards, the Commission maintains, are designed to ensure that foreign nationals do not get included in the country’s voters’ list.","The election commission is set to meet on september 10 to discuss the preparedness of a pan-india rollout of special intensive revision (sir) of voters' list.
