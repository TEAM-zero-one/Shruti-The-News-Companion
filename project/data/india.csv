"Courtrooms have winners & losers, but mediation's healing: CJI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/courtrooms-have-winners-losers-but-mediations-healing-cji/articleshow/120861373.cms,"NEW DELHI: CJI Sanjiv Khanna on Saturday said courtroom adjudication is grim and shallow, as it results in a winner and a loser - a process that fails to heal strained relationships between parties. He contrasted this with mediation, which, he said, seeks to provide a holistic solution that restores relationships.Speaking at the first National Mediation Conference inaugurated by President Droupadi Murmu, CJI Khanna said ' community mediation ' provision in the Mediation Act, 2023 is salutary as this can be an effective tool to resolve disputes that are likely to affect peace, harmony and tranquility among residents or families in a specific area or locality. ""This is an important step forward,"" he said.Justice Khanna said unfortunately mediation, which is ingrained in our civilisational history, is not mainstreamed and not first choice of parties to a dispute even though modern mediation tools can provide solution to litigants, which is unavailable in courtrooms.""In courtroom adjudication, one party is right, the other is wrong. In this way, courtroom litigation and adjudication are grim and shallow. At times, the root cause remains unaddressed, and the ailment and pain remain. The relationships are strained, if not broken.

It does not involve legal and procedural complexities. It is flexible and personalised, not bound by rigid procedure. And above all, it is empathetic - aiming not to win over the other side, but to bring together.""Mediator's neutrality is crucial to achieve resolution of a dispute, said Justrice Khanna, adding that ""a skilled mediator senses not only what is being said, but what lies beneath the words.""","Cji sanjiv khanna said courtroom adjudication is grim and shallow.

NEW DELHI: An FIR has been registered against renowned singer Sonu Nigam following allegations of disrespectful comments about the Kannadiga community during a musical programme in Bengaluru.The complaint was initiated by Dharmaraj A, who heads the Bengaluru city district unit of Karnataka rakshana vedike , an organisation advocating for Kannada interests.The allegations claimed that Sonu Nigam made ""objectionable and emotionally provocative"" remarks that offended the Kannadiga community's sensibilities and fostered discord amongst various linguistic groups in Karnataka.The official complaint stated, ""This complaint is lodged against the renowned singer Shri Sonu Nigam for making objectionable and emotionally provocative statements during a musical event held on April 25 and 26, at East Point College of Engineering and Technology, Virgonagar, Bengaluru, which falls under your police station's jurisdiction. His statements have deeply hurt the sentiments of the Kannadiga community, incited hatred among various linguistic communities in Karnataka, and are likely to provoke violence. A video of Shri Sonu Nigam's statement has gone viral, causing widespread outrage among millions of Kannadigas across the state.""The event took place while the singer was performing at East Point College of Engineering and Technology in Virgonagar, Bengaluru, on April 25. When a fan persistently requested him to perform a Kannada song, Sonu refused, stating that the fan was making demands in an aggressive manner. He then stated, ""Yahi kaaran hai, Pahalgam mein jo hua hai na. Yahi kaaran hai jo kar rahe ho, jo kiya tha na abhi. Dekho toh kaun saamne khada hai.""

"'Born to serve J&K police and my country': Cop, family spared deportation to Pakistan after HC steps in",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/born-to-serve-jk-police-and-my-country-policeman-iftkhar-ali-family-spared-deportation-to-pakistan-after-hc-steps-in/articleshow/120847465.cms,"NEW DELHI: “I am born to serve the Jammu and Kashmir Police and my country, India,” said 45-year-old policeman Iftkhar Ali on Saturday, days after he and his eight siblings narrowly escaped being deported to Pakistan.The intervention of the Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh high court saved them from being sent across the border, a move Ali called a “conspiracy” rooted in false claims about their nationality.Ali, a resident of Salwah village in Mendhar sub-division near the Line of Control in Poonch district, has served in the police force for 27 years, earning multiple commendations for his dedication and bravery. “I have served all the wings in the police department over the past 27 years, which is evident from the scars on my body, and the citations and rewards which I have received from the department for shedding my sweat and blood for the country,” he said.Ali was among over two dozen individuals, mostly from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), who were issued 'Leave India' notices in Poonch, Rajouri, and Jammu districts last week. Many were taken to Punjab for deportation.However, after filing a petition, Ali and his siblings—Mohd Shafiq (60), Nashroon Akhter (56), Akseer Akhter (54), Mohd Shakoor (52), Naseem Akhter (50), Zulfqar Ali (49), Koser Parveen (47), and Shazia Tabasum (42) -- were brought back to their native village when the court stayed the deportation order.Justice Rahul Bharti, hearing their plea, stated, “(The) petitioners are not asked or forced to leave UT of Jammu & Kashmir. This direction is, however, subject to objections from the other side.” The Deputy Commissioner of Poonch has been asked to submit an affidavit detailing the petitioners’ property status, with the next hearing scheduled for May 20.Ali claims the deportation notice was triggered by a long-standing land dispute with his maternal uncle. “We have a land holding of nearly five hectares with another two hectares illegally usurped by my maternal uncle... The deportation notice is the outcome of that very dispute because they do not want to return our land,” he said.According to officials, Ali’s parents—Faqur Din and Fatima Bi—had crossed into PoK during the 1965 war and spent years in a Tralkhal refugee camp before returning to Salwah in 1983 with their children. Between 1997 and 2000, the J&K government admitted them as permanent residents, though their citizenship status remains pending with the Centre.The family’s ordeal came amid rising tensions between India and Pakistan following the April 22 terror attack in Kashmir's Pahalgam, which killed 26 people, mostly tourists. In response, the Centre announced strict measures, including downgrading diplomatic ties, suspending the Indus Waters Treaty, and ordering all Pakistanis on short-term visas to leave India by April 27.“We have a centuries-old history of being the bona fide residents of Salwah with both our parents and other ancestors buried in the village… the notice came as a shocker to our family comprising more than 200 members, including some serving in the Army,” Ali said. He currently serves in Katra, the base camp for pilgrims visiting the Mata Vaishno Devi shrine, and lives with his wife and three children aged 6 to 11.Despite the trauma, Ali expressed confidence in India’s leadership. He lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, saying, “I am confident that the country's leadership will not allow [my] handing over to the 'enemy nation' on the 'mere conspiracy' that they belong to the part of J&K which is under illegal occupation of Pakistan.”“The most painful moment of my life was when I was told that I did not belong to this country,” he recalled. “I do not belong to Pakistan and nobody is there for me. I belong to India and this is my country. I love the police from the core of my heart and I am ready to sacrifice my life for the country.”Ali also expressed gratitude to his legal team and socio-political activist Safeer Choudhary, who supported the family during the crisis. “I also come from Mendhar and I know they have a genuine case so I came forward on humanitarian grounds to mobilise support in their favour so that they are not deported to Pakistan,” Choudhary said.","Iftkhar ali has served in the police force for 27 years, earning multiple commendations.

NEW DELHI: In a first of its kind initiative, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research ( ICAR ) - India's premier agri research organisation - has developed the country's first genome-edited climate-resilient varieties of rice to boost yields and conserve water.The ICAR claimed that the cultivation of these improved rice varieties -- ‘ DRR Dhan 100 (Kamala)’ and ‘ Pusa DST Rice 1 ’ -- in about 5 million hectares of the recommended area will produce 4.5 million tons of additional paddy and save a minimum 7,500 million cubic meters of irrigation water. Besides, it will also reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (32,000 tons).Genome-editing, particularly the CRISPR-Cas technology , is being recognised as a breakthrough in precision breeding. It enables scientists to make targeted changes in the native genes of living organisms, creating new and desirable traits without introducing foreign DNA.""Development of these two varieties using genome editing technology has paved the way for using this innovative method in other crops too for higher yields, climate resilience and improved quality to achieve the targets of Viksit Bharat,"" said an official note, released by the ICAR, on late Saturday. Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan will formally release these two varieties on Sunday.Recognizing the transformative potential of new technology, the ICAR initiated a genome-editing research project in rice in 2018 and selected two widely cultivated mega rice varieties -- ‘Samba Mahsuri (BPT5204)’ and ‘MTU1010 (Cottondora Sannalu)’ -- to further enhance their qualities through technological interventions.The ICAR scientists eventually enhanced these varieties with better stress tolerance, improved yield, and climate adaptability without compromising their existing strengths, and developed two new genome-edited varieties ‘Kamala’ and ‘Pusa DST Rice 1’.""The initiative marks a significant step forward in India’s efforts to ensure food security and sustainable agriculture in the face of mounting environmental challenges. There are few concerns about the Intellectual Property Rights of the technology which are being looked after and will be resolved in times to come,"" said the ICAR.The genome-edited 'DRR Dhan 100 (Kamala)' is recommended for cultivation across major rice-growing states, including Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. The other new variety - ‘Pusa DST Rice 1' - is also recommended for cultivation in most of these states.Currently, genome-editing programmes have also been initiated by the ICAR in many crops including oilseeds and pulses.","Indian council of agricultural research has developed the country's first genome-edited climate-resilient varieties of rice.

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Saturday vociferously demanded that elections should be held in Manipur at the earliest as it alleged that President's rule imposed in February has failed to put an end to violence and the situation is far from normal.The opposition party trained its guns at Prime Minister Narendra Modi as it questioned why he has not visited strife-torn Manipur so far.With May 3 marking two years since violence first broke out in Manipur, the Congress leadership led by party president Mallikarjun Kharge claimed that since January 2022, the last election rally of the PM in Manipur, Modi has made 44 foreign visits and 250 domestic visits across the nation. “Yet you have not spent a single second in Manipur. Why this apathy and disdain for the people of Manipur? Where is the political accountability?,” Kharge asked in a statement.Mocking the BJP slogan, he said, ""Your double assault govt is still failing Manipur. Despite the home ministry's rule in place now, incidents of violence haven't stopped, Kharge alleged and added, “ Modi ji once again you failed upholding—Rajdharma!!”.Addressing a press conference at AICC in Delhi, Congress’ Manipur in-charge, Saptagiri Ulaka, and the Pradesh Congress Committee president, Keisham Meghachandra Singh highlighted that the President’s Rule had neither helped in improving the situation nor in restoring peace and the confidence of people. They also questioned the intention of the govt for not making public the report of the commission constituted by the home minister on the violence.“The violence began on May 3, 2023 and still continues. Just two days ago, 25 people were injured in a violent clash in Tamenglong district. More than 260 people have died. 68,000 people displaced and thousands are still living in relief camps,” Kharge said.Meghachandra pointed out that despite the formation of the Peace Committee in 2023, no meeting has been held till now.Earlier in the day, Congress general secretary in-charge of communications, Jairam Ramesh said, ""what began on May 3, 2023, therefore, was the self-dictated, self-directed derailment of the so-called double engine sarkar in the state. Three months later, the Supreme Court was compelled to declare that there had been an absolute breakdown of Constitutional machinery in the state.""""The anguish and suffering of Manipur continues. Political games are being played. No worthwhile reconciliation process is under way,"" he added.","The opposition party trained its guns at prime minister narendra modi as it questioned why he has not visited strife-torn manipur so far.

He added that those responsible for the attack will be held accountable and given appropriate response.""Today, they should not think that by killing 27 citizens, they have won the war. I want to tell all the perpetrators of terrorism that this is not the end of the fight but only a turning point... ek makam hai, har vyakti ko chun-chun kar jawab milega, jawab bhi liya jayega (each one involved will be given a fitting response and will be held accountable too),"" Shah said in his first public speech after the slaughter of tourists at Pahalgam.Shah, who was addressing a meeting after the unveiling of the statue of Upendranath Brahma, a leading figure among the Bodos, in Delhi, asserted that the fight against terrorists and their backers would continue until each one of perpetrators is punished.Shah said BJP govt, under PM Modi's leadership, has effectively tackled terror threats everywhere - be it in the northeast, areas impacted by left-wing extremism, or in Kashmir - and has given befitting responses. ""If anyone thinks that a cowardly attack is their big victory, they must remember this is Narendra Modi's India - none will be spared. Our resolve is to uproot terrorism from every inch of India, and it will become a reality,"" he added.Soon after the terror attack, the home minister had rushed to Srinagar and visited Baisaran meadow in Pahalgam.

""I want to tell all tribes that BJP govt honours the pacts it signs. We are implementing several agreements that were signed before us. They (earlier govts) did not follow them.

Police response and current situation

NEW DELHI: Amid rising tensions following the murder of Hindutva activist Suhas Shetty, the Mangaluru Police have imposed a prohibitory order across the city from Friday until May 6. Shetty, a known rowdy sheeter and Hindutva activist, was killed by a group of unidentified assailants late Thursday evening within the Bajpe police station limits in Mangaluru City.On Thursday evening, around 8:30 pm, Suhas Shetty was traveling with five associates—Sanjay, Prajwal, Anvith, Latheesh, and Shashank—when their vehicle was intercepted near Kinnipadavu Cross by a group of assailants.The attackers, numbering around six, were traveling in a Swift car and a pickup truck. They ambushed Shetty and his group, assaulting him with deadly weapons, inflicting severe injuries.Despite being rushed to AJ Hospital, Shetty succumbed to his wounds. The police have since registered a murder case and are actively working to identify and apprehend the perpetrators.Shetty was a well-known rowdy sheeter with five criminal cases—four in Mangaluru City and one in Dakshina Kannada district.Given Shetty's affiliations, his murder is considered a sensitive issue, prompting the police to launch a manhunt to locate the perpetrators.Notably, he was one of the accused in the 2022 murder of Mohammed Fazil, a 23-year-old resident of Mangalapete in Katipalla. Fazil's killing had already stirred significant tensions across the coastal region.In response to the incident, police issued the prohibitory order under Section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, enforced across the entire Mangaluru City Police jurisdiction.City police commissioner Anupam Agrawal, who also serves as the additional district magistrate, announced that public gatherings, meetings, processions, sloganeering, and the carrying of items that could be used as weapons are prohibited during this period. The measure aims to prevent any potential flare-ups and maintain public order in the aftermath of the murder.Preliminary investigations suggest that the attack on Shetty was premeditated, though the exact motive remains unclear. The police have confirmed that investigations are ongoing.Following the murder, Bajrang Dal had called for a city bandh late on Thursday night, and some miscreants attempted to pelt stones at buses. The police have since increased security in the area, ensuring adequate deployment and continuous patrols to monitor the situation. ""We have registered a murder case, and teams are working on it. It is too early to say what the motive was behind the murder. We have imposed prohibitory orders to ensure peace in the city,"" Commissioner Agrawal stated.","Suhas shetty, a known rowdy sheeter and hindutva activist, was killed by a group of unidentified assailants late thursday evening within the bajpe police station limits in mangaluru city.

Kirk Cousins could end Aaron Rodgers' comeback dreams as Steelers move fast to replace their QB gap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/kirk-cousins-could-end-aaron-rodgers-comeback-dreams-as-steelers-move-fast-to-replace-their-qb-gap/articleshow/120749044.cms,"Kirk Cousins could cut Aaron Rodgers down the line and take the job in Pittsburgh (Getty Images)

With Aaron Rodgers undecided, Kirk Cousins emerges as top alternative

The Pittsburgh Steelers are currently facing a pivotal moment in their quarterback strategy, with two high-profile names in the spotlight Aaron Rodgers and Kirk Cousins. The team has reportedly offered Rodgers a one-year deal worth $10 million in hopes of bringing his leadership and experience to Pittsburgh. However, Rodgers, now nearing the twilight of his career, has yet to make a firm decision, potentially weighing retirement or a more favorable opportunity.Aaron Rodgers’ indecision has led the Steelers to look at backup options, and Kirk Cousins has emerged as a serious contender. Cousins, who signed a massive four-year, $180 million contract with the Atlanta Falcons, recently found himself unexpectedly sidelined. The Falcons chose to start rookie quarterback Michael Penix Jr., leaving Cousins' future with the team in doubt. Frustrated by the move, Cousins is now open to joining another team where he can continue as a starter, and the Steelers may offer that chance.Just days ahead of the 2025 NFL Draft, reports from The Athletic’s Dianna Russini suggest that a potential three-team trade is gaining momentum between the Browns, Steelers, and Vikings one that could include veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins. With Cousins openly expressing his desire to move on from the Falcons, Pittsburgh is shaping up to be the most appealing landing spot for him.""It's believed that Cousins would be against any trade that involves sending him to a situation involving a young QB, similar to the situation he faced in Atlanta last year,"" Russini stated, alluding to the entry of rookie Michael Penix Jr., who overtook Cousins for the starting role during the 2024 campaign.Despite his availability, Kirk Cousins brings both promise and concern. On the one hand, he offers veteran experience and consistent performance in the regular season. On the other hand, he has a reputation for struggling under pressure, particularly in high-stakes games, and he posted a high number of interceptions in his last season. For the Steelers, who prioritize ball control and limiting turnovers, this could be a significant red flag.Financially, bringing Kirk Cousins to Pittsburgh won’t be easy. His contract is massive, and the Falcons are reportedly seeking a team willing to take on a substantial portion of his salary. This could become a major obstacle unless both teams agree to a restructuring deal. Still, if the Steelers decide that Cousins is the right fit, they may be willing to negotiate.Currently, the Steelers' quarterback depth includes Mason Rudolph, Skylar Thompson, and rookie Will Howard. While all three have potential, none bring the same level of experience or immediate impact that Rodgers or Cousins could offer. The Steelers are clearly looking for a proven starter to elevate their playoff hopes in a competitive AFC.Also Read: Are the Jets setting themselves up for disaster? Ignoring defensive tackles in record-breaking NFL Draft could be a colossal mistake In the end, the decision hinges on Aaron Rodgers’ choice. If he declines, the Steelers must weigh whether Kirk Cousins is worth the financial and performance risk.
