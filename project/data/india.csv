BJP brass will decide on govt formation: Manipur MLA

IMPHAL: A group of 10 MLAs led by BJP's Thokchom Radheshyam met Manipur governor Ajay Bhalla on Wednesday to convey their readiness to form a govt in the state which has been under President's Rule since Feb.The group claimed support of 44 NDA legislators. Independent MLA Sapam Nishikant Singh spoke in the same vein.The 44 MLAs mentioned by Radheyshyam include 30 of 37 BJP legislators, including former CM N Biren Singh; six NPP MLAs; all five NPF MLAs; the lone JD(U) MLA; and two of three Independents. The seven remaining BJP legislators, two Kuki People's Alliance members and one Independent, all belonging to the Kuki-Zo community, are not part of this group.The 60-member Manipur assembly currently has 59 MLAs, with one seat vacant due to the death N Kayisii, who represented Tadubi constituency. Opposition Congress has five members.While BJP refrained from commenting on the development, there were indications that the group of 10 could not have acted unilaterally.Manipur has been under President's Rule since Feb after Biren Singh resigned as CM amid criticism about his govt's handling of the ethnic clashes between Meiteis and Kuki-Zos.The assembly, which has been under suspended animation, can be revived any time before the current spell of President's Rule expires on Aug 13, should BJP decide to form another govt.Radheshyam was vague on whether the initiative for the meeting with the governor had been sanctioned by the BJP brass. ""The central leadership of BJP will take the decision,"" he quipped.Significantly, he revealed that Speaker Thokchom Satyabrata Singh has ""individually and jointly"" sounded the 44 MLAs and that there is no one who opposes the formation of a new govt. ""We are ready to stake a claim to form a govt,"" he added.""People have faced so my hardships. In the previous term, two years were lost due to Covid, and in this term, another two years have been lost due to the conflict,"" said Radheshyam, emphasising the need for the return of a political dispensation in Imphal.The development comes amid intense protests in the Imphal Valley over an order by security forces to conceal the state's name - Manipur - on the windshield of a govt bus.Meitei groups demanded an official apology from the governor over the incident that happened in Gwaltabi on May 20, and the resignation of the chief secretary, the DGP and the security adviser.More than 250 people have died since the ethnic strife broke out on May 3, 2023, in the state. Meitei groups maintain that the territorial integrity of the state is non-negotiable in any peace process, while the Kuki-Zos assert that the only solution to resolve the crisis is creating a separate administration for the hill districts where they live.","Group of 10 mlas led by bjp's thokchom radheshyam met manipur governor ajay bhalla on wednesday.

NAINITAL: To address Nainital's parking crisis, MHA Wednesday issued formal directives allocating the premises of the Metropole Hotel to the Uttarakhand government for temporary use as a parking facility.Built in 1880, the hotel once belonged to the Raja of Mehmoodabad, who migrated to Pakistan. A luxury destination in its prime, it famously hosted figures such as Pakistan's founding father, Mohd Ali Jinnah, who spent his honeymoon there. It was designated 'enemy property' in the early 1960s.MHA's decision follows a request by CM Pushkar Singh Dhami, who cited the town's acute parking shortage and proposed using the hotel's expansive grounds, capable of accommodating over 1,000 vehicles, for public parking. According to a state govt communique, home minister Amit Shah responded positively, confirming MHA's approval in an official letter to the CM.

Vajpayee Called Indira Durga: Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Slams Rahul Gandhi's Remarks on Op Sindoor

NEW DELHI: Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) partners Shiv Sena (UBT) and Congress on Wednesday indulged in a political slugfest after one Sena (UBT) leader vowed to blacken Rahul Gandhi 's face for his 'derogatory' comments about freedom fighter Vinayak Damodar Savarkar.Nashik city unit chief of Sena (UBT), Bala Darade, slammed Rahul for calling Savarkar 'mafi-veer' and said that he will pelt stones at Congress leaders' convoy if he ever visits Nashik.""We are proud that we live in the birthplace of Swatantrya-veer Savarkar. Rahul Gandhi's statement about Savarkar, calling him 'Mafi-veer', was insulting,"" Darade told a Marathi news channel on the occasion of the birth anniversary of the Hindutva ideologue.""We condemn it strongly. We will blacken Rahul Gandhi's face if he comes to Nashik. If we cannot do that, we will pelt stones at his convoy,"" he added.Nashik-resident Devendra Bhutada has filed a defamation case against Gandhi, claiming that some remarks made by the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha against Savarkar hurt his feelings.Darade further said he did not care about the consequences of his threat for the MVA.Meanwhile, Sena (UBT) spokesperson Sushma Andhare claimed that Darade's views were his own and not the official stand of the Uddhav Thackeray-led party.Congress, however, strongly objected to Darade's remarks and said that Congress workers are capable enough of tackling such threats.""Rahul Gandhi's father, late Rajiv Gandhi, and grandmother, late Indira Gandhi, sacrificed their lives for India's unity. Congress and its leadership are not afraid of such threats,"" he told reporters. ""Rahul Gandhi did not make derogatory remarks against Savarkar,"" Congress Maharashtra unit chief Harshwardhan Sapkal said.""His comments contain historical references. Even (journalist and writer) Arun Shourie, a minister in the Vajpayee government, has written a book on Savarkar, and most references in that book are what Rahul Gandhi has said. Our workers are capable of tackling such threats,"" he added.Former minister Yashomati Thakur also backed Rahul and said, ""Rahul Gandhi only repeated what has been written in history.""The Sena (UBT) is an ally of the Congress in the MVA, and the two parties are also part of the INDIA grouping of the Opposition. In the 2024 assembly elections, the Mahayuti coalition of BJP, Shiv Sena and NCP won 235 of the 288 seats, with BJP securing 132 alone.

Panaji: As a child, Dilna K was afraid of heights. Today, she climbs the INSV Tarini's 25-metre-high mast in the middle of the ocean. In Puducherry, another family watches with similar awe as Roopa Alagirisamy, once a girl with dreams of space, returns after conquering the world's oceans. The two naval officers - Lt Commanders Dilna K and Roopa Alagirisamy - will sail into Mormugao Port on Thursday evening, marking the end of a historic, eight-month-long voyage. Their journey covered 25,400 nautical miles, crossing four oceans and rounding the three Great Capes - a feat attempted by few, and achieved by fewer. Though they grew up on opposite sides of the Anaimalai Hills, what binds them is a relentless grit - a refusal to accept ceilings, whether on land or at sea.From the age of 10, Dilna was never one to be found indoors. While other children studied for tests, she was outdoors - wielding a cricket bat with the boys from her colony or chasing football down dusty lanes. ""She found her passion for rifle shooting in NCC and became a national shooter. Shooting is expensive, she always had to compromise on training and good equipment. I remember her travelling from Kozhikode to Idukki almost every two weeks to practice at a good range,"" Dilna's sister Deepthi said.Before her father, an Army man, passed away in 2015, Dilna made a promise that she would represent India at the international level. On Thursday, as Tarini sails into Mormugao Port, she brings that promise home. Dilna had always been a daddy's girl and still rides her father's Royal Enfield as an ode to him.""She used to pull out 100 buckets of water per day from our well as a young girl to build up her muscles and we used to make fun of her. She would climb coconut trees to develop agility, even though she was scared of heights,"" said Deepthi.Like Dilna, Roopa's journey was shaped by setbacks, and a stubborn refusal to give up. Roopa grew up dreaming of space. With a BE in aeronautical engineering, she even worked a stint with the National Aerospace Laboratories, Bengaluru. But her true launchpad came from the Navy. ""Roopa faced so many SSB interviews. It felt like she was going in circles,"" said her younger sister Durga Monica. ""She decided to make one final attempt. And cleared it.""After being commissioned in June 2017, Roopa's job at the Naval Armament Inspection division in Mumbai required her to inspect weapons, guns, rocket launchers and torpedoes that went into warships and submarines. It is here that she picked up sailing, first as a dinghy sailor and then in competitive sailing. ""She never wanted an ordinary life, with a 9-5 job. She wanted something that others would not do,"" said Monica. ""If you give Roopa an opportunity, she will grab it and there is nothing that will stop her.""Whether it was bungee jumping or her decision to take up surfing, the Alagirisamys had no inkling of Roopa's adventurous streak. ""Nobody knows truth about when she volunteered for sailing in the circumnavigation. She never told any of this to us,"" said Monica, laughing.Behind the Tarini's voyage are two stories of persistence, parallel, yet bound by the same wind.Roopa and Dilna's journey echoes the trail first charted by INSV Tarini's all-women crew in 2018. In 2024, Roopa and Dilna made it their own.","Lt commanders dilna k and roopa alagirisamy will sail into goa’s mormugao port on thursday evening.

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Wednesday rejected a PIL seeking a direction to the Union government to constitute a Gujjar regiment in Indian Army , and warned the petitioner that cost would be imposed for filing a 'divisive' petition.""There has to be a right vested in you either by any statute or any law or the Constitution. Which is the law that gives you the right to have such a regiment? Where is that right?"" asked a division bench comprising chief justice D K Upadhyaya and Justice Tushar Rao Gedela.The petitioner, Rohan Basoya, argued that despite a rich martial legacy, Gujjars have not been accorded a dedicated regiment, unlike other martial communities such as Sikhs, Jats, Rajputs, Gorkhas, and Dogras. He submitted that the absence of a Gujjar regiment violates their constitutional rights. ""The demand for a Gujjar regiment has been raised before, but no concrete steps have been taken by the govt. Given the community's presence in border regions like Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, and Punjab, a Gujjar regiment would also serve strategic military interests in counterinsurgency and border security operations,"" the plea said.","Delhi high court rejects a pil seeking a direction to the union government to constitute a gujjar regiment in indian army.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday gave interim bail to a 23-year-old accused of raping a 40-year-old, noting that charges had not been framed even though he had been in jail for nine months. In scathing comments, a bench comprising Justices B V Nagarathna and Satish Chandra Sharma also asked how Delhi Police could file a rape case against the man, a social media influencer, when the woman had gone voluntarily with him.""A single hand can't clap. On what basis have you filed case under Section 376 of IPC. She is not a baby. The woman is 40 years old. They have gone together to Jammu. Why have you invoked 376. This lady goes to Jammu seven times and the husband is not bothered,"" the bench observed. It directed that the accused be produced before the trial court and granted interim bail subject to terms and conditions.According to the police complaint, the woman first came into contact with him in 2021 through social media while seeking a social media influencer to promote her clothing brand. During initial interactions, the accused allegedly requested an iPhone to enhance content creation, which she arranged through an authorised Apple Store in Jammu.However, their professional relationship soured after the accused attempted to resell the device.In December 2021, the man visited the woman at her house in Noida to return the Rs 20,000. He subsequently persuaded her to travel for a brand shoot in Connaught Place. During the journey, the accused allegedly gave her sweets laced with intoxicants and she lost consciousness. Contrary to assurances that she would be taken to Hindu Rao Hospital, the man allegedly took her to a secluded area, sexually assaulted her, stole money from her purse, and captured her nude photographs. Thereafter, the woman was allegedly coerced into travelling to Jammu where she was subjected to continued sexual abuse, extortion, and threats over a two-and-a-half-year period, according to the complaint.","Supreme court gives interim bail to a 23-year-old accused of raping a 40- year-old.

NEW DELHI: The SC on Wednesday asked the Assam Human Rights Commission (AHRC) to inquire into 171 alleged incidents of fake encounters carried out by state police in 2021 but said barring a few incidents the PIL petitioner's claim about fake encounters appeared to be speculative.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh disposed of a petition by an advocate Arif M Y Jwadder and said, ""We direct the AHRC to issue a public notice inviting all individuals who claim to be aggrieved (victims and their family members) by the alleged police encounters to come forward and furnish relevant evidence.""Allowing AHRC to select team of police officials unconnected to the encounters for further inquiry into some cases if the need be, the bench said ""fair and impartial inquiry"" is a right of citizens aggrieved by police action and expected AHRC to adopt robust measures akin to witness protection protocols to safeguard the privacy, safety and security of those participating in the inquiry process.The state, in its counter-affidavit had said that out of a total of 171 cases, chargesheets have been filed in 125 cases, forwarding reports submitted in 23 cases, and remaining 23 cases are under investigation. Writing the judgment and examining the allegations of the petitioner, Justice Kant said that he has failed to independently place on record any cogent or verifiable material to substantiate the allegations.Justice Kant said, ""After minutely scanning such data, prima facie it seems that barring a few cases, it is difficult to infer that there has been a procedural breakdown, or the guidelines (relating to encounter inquiry) were flagrantly violated. "" Referring to the status report relating to each FIR furnished by Assam, the bench said, ""These documents prima facie belies the (petitioner's) claim of inaction and do establish that, at least at the foundational level, the criminal process was duly initiated.

MUMBAI: A 40-year-old man from Worli has been sentenced to four months of rigorous imprisonment after his pet husky bit his neighbour inside an apartment lift. The man, Rishab Patel, was convicted on charges of voluntarily causing hurt and negligent conduct with an animal.Judicial magistrate Suhas Bhosale, while delivering the verdict, said he would not show Patel ""too much leniency"". Referring to CCTV footage, the judge noted, ""The way in which the accused dragged his pet inside lift shows he is not compassionate towards his own pet. He did not care about the informant, his son and dragged his own pet inside the lift... the act... resulted in injury.""The victim, Ramik Shah, a resident of Alfa Apartment in Worli, was heading down from the fourth floor with his one-and-a-half-year-old son and domestic help. When the lift stopped at the third floor, Patel was standing with his dog. Shah said he requested Patel to wait, explaining that his son was cynophobic (afraid of dogs). However, Patel allegedly ignored the request and did not even allow them to exit. Instead, he dragged his dog into the lift, which bit Shah on his left forearm. After the incident, Shah, his son, and the help exited the lift, but Patel allegedly followed them and challenged Shah to ""do whatever he wanted.""Shah later sought medical treatment and filed a police complaint.During the trial, the prosecution presented oral evidence from the victim, Ramik Shah, and his domestic help, Anuj Singh, who confirmed Patel had forcibly entered the lift with the dog despite repeated requests.The defence pointed to inconsistencies, including a delay in medical treatment and the initial absence of administration of anti-rabies vaccine for the victim. However, the magistrate found the testimonies of both Shah and Singh consistent and credible. ""Only because the witness is servant of the first informant we cannot brush aside his evidence if it is otherwise trustworthy,"" he ruled. Holding Patel's actions as ""voluntary,"" the court fined him Rs 4,000 in addition to sentencing him to jail.","Rishab patel, 40, was convicted on charges of voluntarily causing hurt and negligent conduct with an animal.
