Forces reclaim Koragutta Hills in Chhattisgarh from Maoists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/forces-reclaim-koragutta-hills-in-chhattisgarh-from-maoists/articleshow/120777090.cms,"NEW DELHI: Chhattisgarh govt sources on Wednesday claimed to have cleared a portion of the Koragutta Hills in Bijapur , which borders Telangana, of Maoists ' presence as counter-Naxal forces, who had encircled the Naxal bastion in an massive operation under way for the past nine days, reclaimed the hilltop and hoisted the tricolour there at 5,000 feet.Though top Maoist leaders and cadres of the notorious People's Liberation Guerrilla Army 's (PLGA) Battalion No. 1 - including Hidma, Deva and Damodar - were initially contained at the hilltop and supply lines to them cut as commandos from the Chhattisgarh Police's District Reserve Guard (DRG) and Special Task Force (STF) and CRPF's CoBRA battalion dominated the access from the Chhattisgarh side, a top officer of the Chhattisgarh govt said the Naxalites managed to escape to Telangana from the other side of the hill. ""It appears the Telangana special forces, which were part of the operation initially, were not manning the escape routes on their side,"" said the officer.""This region was the bastion of top Naxal commanders like Hidma, Deva, Damodar, Azad and Sujata. Chhattisgarh police and CoBRA battalion have now reclaimed the hills on its side. Cornered, the Maoist leaders and PLGA cadres have escaped and found sanctuary in Telangana.

The 1991 batch IAS officer retired as additional chief secretary of transport department.BJP had flagged the Vadra-DLF deal as a symbol of corruption during its 2014 Lok Sabha campaign against the then UPA govt.

Most of his tenure, first under Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led Congress govt and then BJP ministry, was spent in the archaeology and museums department.BJP had once cited Khemka's alleged persecution as a manifestation of Congress getting even with ""a whistleblower"". But even before the party had completed a year at the Centre since winning the 2024 polls, he was back in a purportedly inconsequential role.Khemka had vented on social media and written to the govt about ""mistreatment"" on several occasions.

After training, he was posted at Naugaon in Chhatarpur district and then at Nivas in Mandla district. On HC's recommendation, he was dismissed from service in 2014.

Caste census BJP's bid to stop erosion of broader Hindu unity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/caste-census-bjps-bid-to-stop-erosion-of-broader-hindu-unity/articleshow/120776485.cms,"NEW DELHI: The desire to negate efforts to retard broader Hindu consolidation appears to have played a major role in the decision of the cabinet committee on political affairs (CCPA) to include caste enumeration in the next census. While political watchers are linking the move to assembly elections in Bihar, sources pointed out that the political field had been levelled in the state with the caste survey already completed.Besides, the move was closely associated with chief minister Nitish Kumar , BJP's alliance partner, leaving little space for RJD's Tejaswi Yadav to claim bragging rights. A major consideration appears to have been to check attempts to split Hindus on caste lines, a cause for concern for BJP and RSS, which has been working on Hindu consolidation since inception.Sources pointed out that the decision came hours after a one-on-one meeting between PM Narendra Modi and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Tuesday, which capped parleys at different levels of the Sangh and BJP leadership.The electoral success of BJP over the last decade has been facilitated largely by agglomeration of many caste groups coming together with OBCs and upper castes making a common cause. Starting with the 2024 general elections there has been a concerted attempt to splinter the coalition by reviving the thesis of OBC-dalit-Muslim unity, which may have resulted in some groups moving towards the Mandal pillar. The latest move may help BJP arrest the drift and make fresh bridges.It was, however, not clear that the estimate of a nationalist resurgence, which will supplant any 'savarna' resentment over caste census, was part of the larger calculus. In addition, BJP insiders suggested the party stands on a stronger footing, having seized the main talking point from the opposition by taking the initiative, which Congress could not achieve despite its long governance tenure.They said that the party can rightfully claim that it has delivered while Congress only talked about it. While there was initial apprehension about the decision on caste enumeration, the overall assessment was that the caste surveys in some of the states had not caused much turbulence on the ground.BJP sources said that there was no ""unease"" as PM Modi is himself an OBC, while parties like Samajwadi Party and Rashtriya Janata Dal, are identified with dominant OBC castes, which can repel with polarisation of smaller castes against it. The party is also confident of upper caste support as it has already implemented a 10% quota for the economically weaker sections (EWS).Janata Dal (United) national working president Sanjay Kumar Jha also welcomed the move, calling it a significant step for the upliftment of deprived sections. ""Nitish Kumar clearly believes that it is necessary to have accurate data of various castes for the purpose of reducing socio-economic inequality and making accurate plans for the welfare of the targeted sections,"" he added.",Cabinet committee on political affairs (ccpa) to include caste enumeration in next census.

"Tigress survives years with snare knotted around stomach, raises healthy cubs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tigress-survives-years-with-snare-knotted-around-stomach-raises-healthy-cubs/articleshow/120743307.cms,"PILIBHIT: A tigress whose lower back was cinched for years by a metallic snare - an injury so severe it had reshaped her into a silhouette almost cheetah-like - continued not only to survive but to give birth to healthy cubs , a rare feat observed recently in the Surai forest range of Terai East forest division. First sighted with the embedded snare in 2022, and rediscovered in Dec 2023, the tigress stunned forest officials who, as they prepared to dart her for rescue, witnessed her carrying a cub gently in her mouth, a moment that suspended the operation and reframed the story they thought they were about to tell.From the beginning, her case defied expectation. The metallic loop had lodged itself deep in her lumbosacral region, an area crucial for mobility and balance. Yet, despite the physical restrictions - and the internal damage that experts later suspected - she moved through her habitat with enough stealth and strength to hunt, mate, conceive, and rear a litter. Drone surveillance launched after the interrupted rescue attempt confirmed what seemed almost improbable: four cubs, nursed and nurtured, thriving in her care.Today, three of those cubs, now around sixteen months old, roam the forest with their mother, who continues to hunt and provide for them with a tenacity that belies the injury written into her body. To the team observing her, and to the wider circle of wildlife biologists, her survival - and that of her cubs - has become a living case study in endurance, adaptation, and the hidden margins of possibility in the wild.At the Wildlife Institute of India, where a detailed plan for her future is under discussion, Dr Parag Nigam told TOI that the need to rescue the tigress remained urgent. ""The metallic snare poses serious physical and spinal risks that could worsen with time,"" he said, adding that her images would be sent to WII's tiger cell to cross-reference her history with national tiger databases.Veterinary experts studying her case noted the narrow anatomical escape that had allowed her to survive and reproduce. Dr R K Singh, former veterinary head of Kanpur zoo, explained that the snare's position likely spared her kidneys and ovaries, trapping mostly the intestinal loops instead.","Tigress' lower back was cinched for years by a metallic snare.

Centre's big caste census move: Masterstroke or political compulsion?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centres-big-caste-census-move-masterstroke-or-political-compulsion/articleshow/120770419.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Caste census , which has been a key demand of several opposition parties in the last many elections, will finally be a reality with the Centre on Wednesday announcing nationwide caste count along with the next population census.The government, which had till now strongly resisted opposition demands for a caste census, justified its U-turn, citing the ""political and non-transparent"" caste enumeration being conducted by some opposition-ruled states in the name of surveys.Announcing the decision taken by the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs, Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the census comes under the purview of the Centre, but some states have done caste enumeration in ""non-transparent"" manner, which has created doubts in society.""Considering all these facts and to ensure that the social fabric is not disturbed by politics, caste enumeration should be transparently included in the census instead of surveys,"" the Union minister said.However, the opposition was quick to claim victory and, as expected, there were many credit-takers within their ranks. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi , who had made caste census a key issue in the last several elections and was very aggressive with his attacks on the government, welcomed the ""sudden"" decision and said, ""We want people's census, not bureaucrats' census.""""We had said in Parliament that we will make the caste census happen. We had also said that we would scrap the 50 per cent cap, the artificial wall that is in place. Narendra Modi used to say that there are just four castes. Don't know what happened but suddenly after 11 years, caste census has been announced. We completely support it, but we want a timeline. We want to know that by when this will happen,"" Rahul said.The Congress leader was also quick to pitchfork the party-ruled Telangana model of caste census as a blueprint for the national count. ""This is the first step. Telangana has become a model in caste census and it can become a blueprint. We offer our support to the government in designing the caste census. There are two examples - Bihar's and Telangana's and there is a vast difference between the two,"" he added.RJD chief Lalu Prasad said that the Centre's decision is yet another example of how socialist ideas, once dismissed or ridiculed, are eventually adopted by mainstream political forces.""What we socialists proposed 30 years ago -- be it reservation, caste census, equality, fraternity, secularism -- others take decades to follow. There is still a long way to go. But make no mistake -- we will keep making these Sanghis dance to our agenda,"" Lalu Yadav said.Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP John Brittas claimed the government has done a ""volte-face"" in view of the upcoming Bihar elections ""Welcome the caste census, though it is a reversal looking at the Bihar elections. The PM had said he only recognised four castes -- the poor, youth, women, and farmers!! This volte-face is ok but this nation has been denied of the census which was due in 2021!"" he said.The Centre's decision to include caste enumeration in the forthcoming census exercise was a ""hard-earned victory"" for the DMK and Tamil Nadu government, said Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin.The DMK chief said: ""After the failure of all its attempts to deny and delay the much-needed caste enumeration, the Union BJP Government has finally announced that it will be conducted along with the forthcoming Census. But key questions remain unanswered - when will the Census begin? When will it conclude?""""The same Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) who once accused opposition parties of dividing people on caste has now yielded to the very demand, he maligned repeatedly,"" the Tamil Nadu CM said.Caste census was essential, but not optional, for objective policymaking, targeted welfare, and the pursuit of real social justice. ""You cannot remedy injustice without first recognising its scale,"" he added.For the Tamil Nadu government and DMK, this was a hard-earned victory. ""We were the first to adopt a resolution in the Legislative Assembly demanding caste census. We championed this cause in every forum. We reiterated this demand in every meeting with the Prime Minister and through multiple letters, consistently urging the Union Government to take responsibility,"" Stalin said.Ironically, several allies of the BJP in the NDA also welcomed the Centre's decision.The JD(U) said it was its president and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar who created a favourable ground for the development by carrying out a caste survey in Bihar. Its working president, Sanjay Kumar Jha, said the decision will help make a programme for the deprived sections of the society more focussed.Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) president Chirag Paswan said it is an important decision in national interest, saying that his party had long called for it. The decision will be a big step in the country's equitable development, the Union minister said, adding that caste census will help ""make more just and focused policies"". Paswan said that ""misleading claims"" were made about relations between him and the central government over the issue, and that the decision is a clear answer to such rumours.Shiv Sena leader and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde called the government's decision a historic milestone in the country's journey towards social justice that will help in the equitable distribution of resources. ""The caste census will usher in a new era of social justice by enabling accurate policy-making based on the actual demographic data of different castes,"" Shinde said.Several BJP leaders and Union ministers welcomed the government's move and slammed the Congress for its double standards on the issue.Home minister Amit Shah, BJP president JP Nadda and a host of other leaders, including the party's OBC faces, lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan describing it as an unprecedented development towards the cause of social justice.Now, contrast this to what Prime Minister Modi had said on caste census when 26 opposition parties led by the Congress under the INDIA bloc had passed a resolution in favour of caste census.""The Congress is trying to create a divide among people in the name of caste, language and region in its attempt to regain power,"" the Prime Minister had said in February 2024 at an election rally in Madhya Pradesh’s Jhabua district.Clearly, with the opposition's relentless caste census pitch, the BJP seems to have made a course correction. The saffron party will hope that this move will leave the opposition bereft of an important election plank, especially in Bihar, where elections are due later this year. The opposition, meanwhile, will not just claim victory but will also claim that its consistent pressure had forced the government to change its stand on an important social issue. As Rahul Gandhi claimed, ""we have shown that we can pressure the government.""","Caste census has been a key demand of several opposition parties in the last many elections. The government justified its u-turn, citing the ""political and non-transparent"" caste enumeration being conducted by some opposition-ruled states in the name of surveys.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120771259,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-239898,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

State-level surveys: In recent years, states like Bihar, Telangana, and Karnataka conducted their own caste surveys to guide welfare schemes and reservations. Bihar's 2023 survey found that OBCs and Extremely Backward Classes made up more than 63% of its population.

Why caste census matters

What next?

NEW DELHI: Caste enumeration was a regular feature of census exercises during British rule from 1881 to 1931. However, with the first census of independent India in 1951, the government chose to discontinue the practice, except for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs).By 1961, the central government permitted states to conduct their own surveys and compile state-specific lists of Other Backward Classes (OBCs), if they wished.More than six decades later, amid growing political and social demands, the government has now approved the inclusion of caste enumeration in the upcoming nationwide census.The last attempt at caste data collection at a national level took place in 2011 through the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC), intended to assess the socio-economic condition of households alongside caste information.A caste census involves systematically recording individuals’ caste identities during a national census. In India, where caste influences social, economic, and political life, such data can offer valuable insights into the distribution and socio-economic status of various caste groups. This information can help shape policies related to affirmative action and social justice.Beyond statistics, the caste census has deep social and political implications.According to activists, the data could help redesign affirmative action policies , improve representation, and address entrenched inequalities.“Much of access to essential services in India—education, healthcare, nutrition, and social protection—is shaped by structural inequalities of caste, region, religion, and economic status. A caste census is critical to uncover these intersectional disparities and to design policies and programs that are truly equitable and inclusive,” Poonam Muttreja, executive director, population foundation of India told news agency PTI.While some view the caste census as necessary to uplift marginalised communities, others argue it may reinforce caste divisions.The decision marks a major shift after more than 70 years of hesitation. However, details on how the data will be collected, categorised, and applied are yet to be clarified.The move is expected to significantly influence governance, electoral politics, and India's broader battle against inequality. A timeline for the census exercise has not been announced.","Caste enumeration was a regular feature of census exercises during british rule from 1881 to 1931.

Yet, today the community finds itself orphaned once again in the national conscience,” Tickoo said.Alleging that “the so-called candle march brigades” have not lifted a finger or spoken a word to recognise the renewed existential threat to the community, he said: “Let it be amply clear that a callous attitude on part of either the Union govt or the local administration is no longer an option. Prevention, protection and proactive safeguarding measures are the only workable options left. This is not just about increased deployment of quick reaction teams or increased security measures; this is about making our right to life, dignity and presence in our own ancestral land non-negotiable.”“The Kashmiri Pandit community has maintained the civilisational spirit of Kashmir for centuries. But if the State lets us down once again, history will note not only the silence of our oppressors but also the indifference of those constitutionally bound to defend us,” Tickoo said.","Kashmiri pandit sangarash samiti (kpss) asks j&k and union govts to and acknowledge the specific threat profile of kashmiri pandits.

Choudhary said govt issued them all necessary documentation, including passports, domicile certificates, and other official papers.

'Trying to steal credit': BJP slams Rahul's 'pressured govt' remark on caste census



LIVE : प्रेसवार्ता, भाजपा प्रदेश कार्यालय भोपाल.

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday welcomed the Union Cabinet’s decision to conduct a caste census but demanded a clear timeline for its completion, calling it just the “first step” toward deeper social reform.“We welcome the decision, but we need to know how much time it will take to conclude the census,” the Congress leader told reporters hours after the announcement.He also credited public and political pressure for pushing the government to act and said, “We have shown we can pressure the government.”Referring to the Congress party’s longstanding demand, the Rae Bareli MP said: “We had said in the Parliament that we will make caste census happen. We had also said that we would scrap the 50% cap, the artificial wall that is in place. Narendra Modi used to say that there are just four cases. Don’t know what happened but suddenly after 11 years, caste census has been announced.”Calling Telangana a model for such an exercise, Rahul Gandhi said it could serve as a blueprint for the Centre. “We completely support it, but we want a timeline. This is the first step… There are two examples—Bihar’s and Telangana’s—and there is a vast difference between the two.”Outlining the broader vision, Gandhi added, “Caste census is the first step. Our vision is of bringing a new development paradigm through caste census. Not just reservations, but we are also asking central questions—be it OBCs, Dalits, Adivasis, what is their participation in this country?”He also urged the BJP-led NDA government to begin implementing Article 15(5), which allows for reservations in private education institutions. “This is already a law. We want the government to begin implementing it,” he said.Gandhi said, "" I am saying that 28 people have been killed in cold blood. It is pretty clear who is responsible for this. The people who are responsible for this must pay a price. The PM has to take action. The action has to be clear and it has to be strong without any confusion. The PM must not dilly-dally, must not waste time, must make it very clear that India is not going to tolerate this type of nonsense. So, he needs to act...He can act in whatever timeframe he thinks necessary but he has to act soon.""Meanwhile, shortly after Rahul Gandhi’s press briefing, the Bharatiya Janata Party hit back, accusing the Congress and Rahul Gandhi of trying to take credit for the caste census decision.Union Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, “I want to ask Rahul Gandhi, that for many years Congress was in power, then why did they not conduct a caste census?”BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya also echoed similar criticism and said, ""Rahul Gandhi must stop taking credit for the government’s decision on the caste census. Union Home Minister Amit Shah had already indicated on September 18, 2024, that the announcement was forthcoming. In 2011, the Congress-led UPA government initiated the Socio-Economic and Caste Census, which included a caste component—the first such attempt since 1931.""","Lok sabha leader of opposition rahul gandhi welcomed the union cabinet’s decision to conduct a caste census. He demanded a clear timeline for its completion, calling it just the “first step” toward deeper social reform. The bharatiya janata party hit back, accusing the congress and rahul gandhi of trying to take credit for the caste census decision.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120769879,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1099329,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

The petitions were filed by former Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole, who lost to Gadkari in 2019 general election, Nagpur voter Nafis Khan, and other candidates.Although Gadkari was re-elected to LS from Nagpur in 2024 polls, the court decided to hear the matter on merit. It also directed Nagpur bench to expedite proceedings in the original 2019 election petition, which has been pending for over five years, the petitioners' counsel Shakul Ghatole told TOI.The case stems from accusations that Gadkari, while filing his nomination in 2019, failed to fully disclose his assets and under-reported campaign expenditure, allegedly violating the Representation of People Act, 1951. In response, Gadkari filed a plea seeking deletion of certain paragraphs from the petition.Khan's counsel argued that HC prematurely purged substantive content from the petition and failed to assess pleadings holistically. He cited precedents to assert that arguable claims should not be struck down solely on perceived weakness. SC found no merit in these submissions and upheld HC's reasoning, reiterating that courts are empowered to eliminate material that is unnecessary or obstructive to fair adjudication.","Supreme court dismisses a bunch of special leave petitions challenging a 2021 order of nagpur bench of bombay hc that struck down portions of an election petition.

Rekhi sought the boy's release from what he called the illegal custody of the mother, who had taken the child while his father was away on a business trip to Belgium.""For an act to amount to kidnapping, it is necessary that the minor is taken from the custody of a ' lawful guardian '. However, a mother falls well within that ambit, especially in the absence of an order passed by a competent court, divesting her of the same,"" the court said.The boy's father Amit Rekhi was abroad on April 24 when the mother allegedly broke into his office, took the child's passport, and left with him. According to the uncle's plea, she falsely told police she was taking the boy briefly to visit her parents in Delhi - a claim he disputed, saying her mother does not live there. The petitioner also alleged she intended to take the child to Australia, where she currently resides.The mother told the court she came to India because the boy had been left in the care of house help and had requested her presence. She produced call logs and messages exchanged with the child and argued that as his mother and natural guardian, she retains custody rights until the pending guardianship case before Gurgaon family court is resolved.""It would be just and prudent for this court to take into account the wishes and well-being of the detenu, who is 12 years old, and capable of forming a rational opinion about his living situation,"" the HC said, siding with the mother.","Punjab and haryana hc rules that a parent cannot be charged with kidnapping her own child.

Courts can modify arbitral awards: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/courts-can-modify-arbitral-awards-sc/articleshow/120776743.cms,"NEW DELHI: Settling divergent judicial pronouncements on the scope of judicial interference in an arbitral award, a five-judge bench of Supreme Court on Wednesday said that to avoid protracted litigation, courts have powers to modify an award to sustain it by severing the 'invalid' portion from its 'valid' part rather than quashing it entirely.A bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna , CJI-designate B R Gavai and Justices Sanjay Kumar, K V Viswanthan and A G Masih was grappling with a long-standing grey area - when the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, does not expressly permit courts to modify or vary an arbitral award, should courts strike down awards even when it could be saved by minor modifications? Under Section 34 of the Act, a court can only strike down an award.Writing the 37-page 4:1 majority judgment, CJI Khanna said, ""We are of the opinion that modification represents a more limited, nuanced power in comparison to the annulment of an award, as the latter entails a more severe consequence of the award being voided in toto.""""The limited and restricted power of severing an award implies a power of the court to vary or modify the award. It will be wrong to argue that silence in the 1996 Act, as projected, should be read as a complete prohibition,"" he said. Justice Viswanathan penned a 130-page dissent and said courts do not have the power to modify an award as the parties had eschewed the path of litigation to go for arbitration.CJI Khanna said, ""We are thus of the opinion that the court can apply the doctrine of severability and modify a portion of the award while retaining the rest. This is subject to parts of the award being separable, legally and practically.""The majority judgment said courts can also correct clerical, computational and typographical errors apparent in the award and modify the post-award interest rate. CJI Khanna said striking down an award in its totality just because there was no agreement over rate of interest would cause grave prejudice to parties, who would then have to undergo a fresh round of arbitration.""This limited power is significant, as it can help avoid further rounds of litigation. Without it, the court may be forced to set aside the entire award or order a fresh round of arbitration because of an erroneous interest rate rather than simply adjusting this rate,"" the CJI said.Referring to the extraordinary powers of SC under Article 142 of the Constitution, which enables it to pass any order for the purpose of doing complete justice, the five-judge bench sounded a caution and said this power must be exercised with great care and caution while dealing with arbitral awards .","A five-judge bench of supreme court on wednesday said courts have powers to modify an award to sustain it.

NEW DELHI: A man lost interim custody of his eight-year-old daughter, ordered by Kerala HC to stay with her estranged parents alternatively for 15 days in a month, for not being able to provide home-cooked food even for a single day during the stay with him.After interacting with the child, a bench of SC Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta found several reasons - the girl not getting home-cooked food, separated from her three-year-old brother, and no one except father for company - for quashing the HC order on the ground that even though he is a doting father, the surroundings and circumstances at his place is not conducive for her.The man, working at Singapore, had rented out a place in Thiruvananthapuram and used to fly down every month to be with his daughter.Writing the judgment, Justice Mehta said, ""Continued consumption of food procured from restaurants/hotels would pose a health hazard, even to a grown-up person, what to talk of a tender aged child of eight years. The child requires nutritious home-cooked food for her overall well-being, growth and development. Unfortunately, the father is not in a position to provide such nutrition to the child.""SC said it would have considered asking the father to provide home-cooked food, but ""the fact that the child gets no company whatsoever except for that of the father during the interim custody period of 15 days is an additional factor which weighs heavily against his claim for the child's custody at this stage.""Finding the mother works from home and has her parents with her, SC said the girl would get better company at mother's place in addition to the company of her brother.SC also frowned at the HC order granting 15-day custody every month of the three year-old son to the man, terming it ""grossly unjustified"" which could have serious adverse effect on the emotional and physical well-being of the son being forced to be separated from the mother at a tender age.""Hence, the emotional and moral support which the child gets at her mother's home is manifold than what is being provided by the father during the interim custody period. The period of 15 days during which the daughter would be with the father would also lead to deprivation of her company to her sibling, the boy child aged three years,"" it said.SC allowed the man to get interim custody of the daughter on alternate Saturdays and Sundays of every month and interact with them on video call two days every week. ""On either of these two days, father will be entitled to meet & have interim custody of the child for a period of four hours subject to the comfort of the child and under supervision of a child counsellor,"" it said.","The man, working at singapore, had rented out a place in thiruvananthapuram.

KOLKATA: A six-storey hotel nestled within central Kolkata's congested Mechhua wholesale fruit market caught fire on Tuesday evening, quickly turning into a gas chamber that killed 14 people trapped inside, 13 of them guests.All the victims, barring a staffer who jumped to his death in a bid to escape the smoke and another who suffered fatal burns, died of asphyxiation, officials said. Three of the deceased were from a Chennai family that had returned the previous night from a holiday in Darjeeling and Sikkim.Malfunctioning smoke detectors and sprinklers in the 42-room Rituraj Hotel with 88 guests accentuated how unsafe the building was, police said. The hotel had been allegedly functioning over the past three years without the stipulated NOC from fire services department.The fire is suspected to have started in the banquet area on the first floor that was being converted into a dance bar. The state govt set up a special investigation team to probe the blaze after unapproved structural changes were detected within the building, whose owners are absconding.Fire brigade officials said they received the first call from the hotel at 8.10pm Tuesday, shortly after staffer Manoj Kumar Paswan leapt off a ledge and became the first victim. It was only after seeing him jump that locals realised the hotel was on fire.“Since all the windows on the first floor and that of several rooms in the floors above were sealed, nobody outside realised the hotel had caught fire till around 30 minutes later. Inside the hotel, too, guests and hotel staff did not get wind of the blaze till smoke filled the stairwell, corridors, and started seeping into the rooms,” a fireman said.Fire brigade personnel were able to enter the hotel only five hours later. They found 12 people dead in the rooms and the corridor. Another victim collapsed and died after reaching the terrace. Post-mortem reports suggested they died of carbon monoxide poisoning.CM Mamata Banerjee , who was in the sea resort of Digha, took stock of search and rescue efforts with Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim and police commissioner Manoj Verma. “Investigation has been ordered. My condolences to the victim families and solidarity for all affected,” she wrote on X.PM Narendra Modi condoled the deaths and announced ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh to the next of kin of each of the victims and Rs 50,000 for each of those injured.Hakim said Wednesday that illegal portions of the hotel would be demolished.","All the victims, barring a staffer who jumped to his death in a bid to escape the smoke and another who suffered fatal burns, died of asphyxiation.

Caste census move comes a day after PM-Bhagwat meet



New Delhi: In a politically significant and surprising move, the Modi govt Wednesday decided to include caste enumeration in the upcoming decennial census, a first such exercise in more than 90 years. The Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs (CCPA) decision should also clear the way for the much-awaited census.It comes ahead of elections in caste-sensitive Bihar and amid a govt-opposition tussle over leadership of the numerically predominant and politically significant OBC community . It also snatches a major talking point from Congress, especially with Rahul Gandhi repeatedly taking it up and making it virtually the chief issue in the opposition's armoury.At a press conference, I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said Congress talked about it - with then PM Manmohan Singh telling LS that the matter will be considered by the cabinet - but did not act.During UPA tenure, a socio-economic and caste census had been done and later, some states, including Bihar, Telangana and Karnataka, have undertaken surveys.Vaishnaw accused some of the opposition-led states of conducting caste surveys for political reasons and said Modi govt had resolved to transparently include caste enumeration in the forthcoming pan-India census exercise. “This demonstrates that our govt is committed to the values and interests of our society and country, like in the past when our govt had introduced 10% quota for the economically weaker sections of the society without causing stress in any section of society,” he said.In a post on X, home minister Amit Shah called it “a message of strong commitment towards social equality and rights of every section”. Rahul described it as a “sudden decision” that came after it was opposed by the ruling party for 11 years. “We support this completely, but we want a timeline. We want to know by when it will be done,” he said.BJP fielded big guns from OBC community, including agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Dharmendra Pradhan to describe it as a decision towards ensuring social justice . Coming months before Bihar polls, the CCPA decision has injected a new element into the political scenario and opposition will no longer be able to blame govt for opposing a caste census. It came a day after RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat met PM Modi.Sources said the questions on caste and sub-castes would be part of the national census expected next year.
