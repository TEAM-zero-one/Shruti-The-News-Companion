"Lawyer, 27, faked disappearance to escape marriage, traced to Nepal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lawyer-27-faked-disappearance-to-escape-marriage-traced-to-nepal/articleshow/123421063.cms,"Photo/IANS

BHOPAL: A 27-year-old MP lawyer and civil judge aspirant's desperation to escape family pressure to get married led her to meticulously plan a cross-border escape from Itarsi to Nepal's Kathmandu, dodging CCTVs, toll booths and police checkpoints to ensure she didn't leave any trail leading to the life of obscurity she desired.The 13-day search for Archana Tiwari - involving multiple teams from police, GRP and NDRF - culminated Wednesday in Nepal authorities confirming that an Indian woman found living incognito in Kathmandu matched the profile of the young lawyer reported missing by her family after boarding the Indore-Katni Narmada Express on Aug 7.Investigators said her circuitous escape route took her from Itarsi, where she got off the train with an acquaintance, to Kathmandu via Shujalpur, Indore, Hyderabad, Jodhpur, Delhi and then the UP-Nepal border.Her discarded bag had been found in the B3 coach of the train, leading her brother to file a complaint with GRP Katni on Aug 8, the day after Rakshabandhan.Police said they scanned footage from over 500 CCTV cameras, deployed NDRF personnel to scour a forested patch from Barkheda to Budni, and sent divers to search a 32-km stretch of the Narmada. The breakthrough came when investigators pored through her call records.""The name Saransh Jokchand popped up during the scan. Then one thing led to another,"" an officer said. Investigators found out that Saransh travelled with Archana by the Narmada Express and carried clothes for her to change into before getting into a pre-arranged taxi.Tejinder Singh helped the lawyer avoid being captured on surveillance cameras as he was familiar with areas of the railway station outside CCTV coverage. Archana had stopped using her mobile phones before her disappearing act, police said. She handed one of her phones to Tejinder, instructing him to activate it near Midghat and then discard it.Saransh's interrogation gave police enough clues to reconstruct her escape route. ""Being a lawyer, she knew that a missing person case lodged with GRP usually doesn't get pursued aggressively. She was probably convinced the trail would go cold, little knowing that the case would get the media attention it did,"" SP (railways) Rahul Lodha said.Police found out Archana had turned down at least five marriage proposals in recent months. Her family's decision to get her married to a revenue official was purportedly the last straw.",Archana tiwari was reported missing by her family after boarding the indore-katni narmada express on aug 7.

SC frowns on governments hiring temp staffers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-frowns-on-governments-hiring-temp-staffers/articleshow/123420796.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Deprecating the practice of Centre and states not appointing permanent employees and getting their work done by temporary and daily-wage staff, Supreme Court on Tuesday said governments should behave like a ""constitutional employer"" and not like a mere market player.It directed the UP government to regularise from 2002 the services of class 3 and 4 employees who have been working for the state Education Services Selection Commission, reports AmitAnand ChoudharyA bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said govts should not invoke budgetary constraints to justify ad-hocism. The state, as a constitutional employer, should maintain a higher standard.The state, as a constitutional employer, deal with perennial work on a sanctioned footing, creating a budget for the purpose, Supreme Court held.""We think it necessary to recall the state (here referring to both the Union and the State govts) is not a mere market participant but a constitutional employer. It cannot balance budgets on backs of those who perform most basic and recurring public functions. Where work recurs day after day and year after year, the establishment must reflect that reality in its sanctioned strength and engagement practices. The long-term extraction of regular labour under temporary labels corrodes confidence in public administration and offends the promise of equal protection.Financial stringency certainly has a place in public policy, but it is not a talisman that overrides fairness, reason and the duty to organise work on lawful lines,"" the bench said.SC passed the order on a petition seeking regularisation of jobs of people who had been performing peon/attendant duties for the commission since 1989. Allowing their plea, SC directed that their services be regularised from 2002, with arrears being paid until the date of regularisation/retirement/death, as the case may be.""It must necessarily be noted ad-hocism thrives where administration is opaque. The state departments must keep and produce accurate establishment registers, muster rolls and outsourcing arrangements, and they must explain, with evidence, why they prefer precarious engagement over sanctioned posts where the work is perennial. If constraint is invoked, the record should show what alternatives were considered, why similarly placed workers were treated differently, and how the chosen course aligns with Articles 14, 16 and 21 of the Constitution of India,"" the bench said.","Supreme court criticises practice of centre and states not appointing permanent employees.

Government: Governor can scrap bill by withholding assent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-governor-can-scrap-bill-by-withholding-assent/articleshow/123420773.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Amid conflicts between governors and opposition-led governments in states, the Centre on Wednesday told Supreme Court that if a governor, in rare and extraordinary circumstances, chooses to withhold assent to a bill passed by a state assembly, the bill gets scrapped.Solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta had to labour a good part of the day before a five-judge Constitution bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar to explain the sweeping power conferred on governors through Article 200 of the Constitution.The proposition, which the SG said, is backed by two five-judge SC bench judgments categorically stating that if a governor exercised the option of withholding assent, then the bill ""falls through"", evoked questions from a bench that was clearly alive to frequent stalemates between governors and state govts over indefinite pendency of bills with the former.Mehta said on a bill, the governor has options of granting assent, withholding assent, reserving it for the President's consideration or returning it to the assembly with suggestions for modification. ""Once he declares he has withheld assent, the bill falls through. The governor then cannot exercise any of the other three options,"" he said. ""The governor can simpliciter withhold assent ...if he believes the bill is unconstitutional or beyond any remedial changes, in which case the bill would 'fall through' or lapse as has been observed in several SC judgments by five-judge benches.Solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta argued that the Constitution fixes no timeline for governors, in exercise of their plenary powers, to choose any of the four options. ""The constitutional provision conferring such powers on the governor can only be amended by Parliament and the judiciary cannot encroach on the legislative domain in the guise of interpretation,"" Mehta said in what appeared to be a challenge aimed at the verdict of a two-judge bench fixing deadlines for governors and the President to take a call on bills sent to them for assent.CJI Gavai said similar arguments were advanced by ruling dispensations when it came to SC directing the speaker to decide within a timeframe petitions on disqualification of MLAs under the anti-defection law. For the sake of democracy, SC has fixed timelines for speakers in such cases, he said.Mehta, however, argued that the two cases are not alike since the speaker, while adjudicating petitions under the anti-defection law, acts as a tribunal and not in his/her constitutional capacity. It is a settled law that as a tribunal he is amenable to the jurisdictions of HCs and SC, he further argued. The SG said discretionary power to 'withhold assent to a bill' is one of the few areas, delineated by the Constitution, where the governor is not bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers of the state. ""Because no council of ministers would advise the governor to withhold assent to a bill, yet that power is specifically given by the Constitutio,"" he said.The SG cited 10 illustrative situations where the governor would be well within his discretionary powers to withhold assent to a bill to render it ineffective. He said, for instance, if a border state enacts a law allowing citizens of a neighbouring country free entry into the state, the governor would be justified in withholding assent.","The proposition, which the sg said, is backed by two five-judge sc bench judgments, evoked questions from a bench that was clearly alive to frequent stalemates between governors and state govts.

Rain fury in Mumbai

NEW DELHI: IndiGo on Wednesday issued a travel advisory in the wake of heavy rain expected in Mumbai, which the airline said could ""lead to air traffic congestion and impact flight operations"".""While we want your journey to be as hassle-free as possible, Mother Nature has her own plans. With heavy rains expected again in Mumbai, there’s a chance this could lead to air traffic congestion and impact flight operations,"" the issue said.The IndiGo assured that any changes to the flight schedule will be shared with the passengers and urged them to spare extra time for the commute.""While we continue doing our best to keep operations smooth, we recommend planning ahead. Any changes to your flight schedule will be shared via your registered contact details, so do ensure they’re up to date. Check your flight status on our website or app before heading to the airport. And with waterlogging and slow-moving traffic likely, allow some extra time for your commute,"" the release by the airline said.On Tuesday, flight operations suffered partially in the city amid the heavy rains. From Monday midnight to 7 pm Tuesday, 11 flights were diverted to other airports, while 24 arriving flights were forced to abort landing and climb to make a second attempt at touchdown.The cascading delays hit flight schedules through the day, and worst hit were passengers booked on evening flights, with arrivals and departures delayed by an hour.Just like Monday, auto and taxi refusals were rampant. Power outages were witnessed in the suburbs. Kurla suffered as two substations of Adani Electricity shut down, affecting 1,000 families. Andheri, Jogeshwari, Kandivli, Ghatkopar, Vile Parle and Mira Road also saw power cuts.In one of the record number of diversions by BEST in recent years, 135 bus routes were diverted due to waterlogging on roads as heavy rain crippled Mumbai on Tuesday.The India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) red alert for Tuesday proved spot-on as the city endured another day of intense rainfall, making this the wettest Aug in five years. So far, 891 mm of rain has been recorded, well above the average monthly rainfall of 560.8 mm. The last time Mumbai saw higher Aug rainfall was in the year 2020, when 1,240.1 mm was recorded.The monsoon season total has also crossed expectations, reaching 2,193.2 mm, surpassing the average of 2,101.8 mm.Rainfall data further indicates that this has been one of Mumbai’s longest intense rain spells in recent years. In the past 108 hours (Aug 15–19), the city received 837.3 mm, with three of the five days logging close to or over 200 mm. This exceeds the total rainfall of June (512.7 mm) and July (797.3 mm); July is normally considered the year’s wettest month.Tuesday’s downpour was clearly much more intense than Monday’s. The IMD Santacruz observatory recorded 163.4 mm rain in a nine-hour period between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm — more than Monday’s tally of 129.1 mm for the same period. Vikhroli too saw a sharp spike at 161.5 mm, up from 139.5 mm, while Juhu, Byculla and Bandra logged marginal increases. Colaba weather station also recorded 63 mm of rain in the same period compared to 55.4 mm the previous day.The 24-hour period ending 8.30 am on Aug 19 also saw some extremely heavy rain being recorded of over 300 mm in some pockets. Chincholi in Malad reported a staggering 361 mm, one of the highest across the city.Tuesday’s spell added to a rare pattern — Mumbai inching towards yet another 200 mm-plus rain day within less than a week, after logging 244 mm between Aug 15-16 and 238 mm on Aug 18–19. In the 12 hours ending 8.30 pm on Tuesday, the IMD Santacruz observatory had already recorded 171.2 mm of rain.The rain fury also spilled into the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, with Thane, Kalyan, Vasai and Virar reporting triple-digit showers. In the 24 hours ending 8.30 am on Aug 19, Vasai recorded 219 mm of rain while Navi Mumbai logged in 185 mm.The rain fury is expected to continue till Wednesday under an orange alert for Mumbai, with the IMD indicating some relief only from Thursday, when a yellow alert has been issued signalling reduced intensity.","Indigo issues a travel advisory in the wake of heavy rain expected in mumbai.

Opposition, Centre lock horns

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday tabled three bills in the Lok Sabha amid heavy opposition protests and sloganeering.The bills aim for the removal of Prime Minister, Union minister, chief minister or state/UT minister of they are arrested or kept in custody for serious criminal charges for 30 consecutive days. The three Bills are:If a lawmaker is in custody for 30 straight days for crimes punishable with five years or more in jail, they will automatically lose their post on the 31st day.Amit Shah also moved a motion in the Lok Sabha to refer these three bills to a joint parliamentary committee for further discussion.After introducing three bills targeting “tainted” PMs, CMs, and ministers, Union home minister Shah said it was up to the people to decide whether it was appropriate for a prime minister, chief minister, or minister to continue running the government while being in jail.Notably, former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Tamil Nadu minister V Senthil Balaji never resigned after their arrests on different charges.The Constitution does not have rules to remove a Prime Minister or minister under serious criminal charges. This bill proposes amending Articles 75, 164, and 239AA so that ministers at the Union, state, and Delhi government levels can be removed if arrested for serious crimes.Currently, the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963 does not allow removing a chief minister or minister if they are arrested for serious crimes. This bill proposes amending Section 45 to give a legal framework for their removal.The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019 currently lacks a provision to remove the chief minister or ministers in such cases. This bill proposes amending Section 54 to provide a legal way to remove them if they are in custody for serious criminal charges.Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi slammed the bill brought by Amit Shah, saying, ""There is a lot of action going on about the new Bill that the BJP is proposing. We are going back to medieval times when the king could just remove anybody at will. There's no concept of what an elected person is. He doesn't like your face, so he tells ED to put a case, and then a democratically elected person is wiped out within 30 days.""RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, positioning himself as the primary challenger to Nitish Kumar in Bihar, called the bills part of a ""larger conspiracy."" Speaking to ANI, he said, “This bill has been brought because it is part of a larger conspiracy to pressurize Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and ask him to stay in limits and accommodate BJP leaders in the tickets given to JDU leaders… This bill has been brought to keep Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu in check… They can also file a new case (on Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar). ..”AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi described the bills as the ""last nail in the coffin,"" declaring, “I stand to oppose the introduction of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill 2025, the Government of Union Territories (Amendment) Bill 2025, and the Constitution (One Hundred and Thirtieth Amendment) Bill 2025. This violates the principle of separation of powers and undermines the right of the people to elect a government. It gives executive agencies a free hand to act as judge and executioner based on flimsy allegations and suspicions.” He added, “This government is hell-bent on creating a Police State. This will be the final nail in the coffin of elected governments. The Indian Constitution is being amended to turn this country into a police state. The Chief Minister and the Ministers will not be accountable to the people.”Responding to the opposition backlash, Amit Shah said that while Prime Minister Narendra Modi has brought a constitutional amendment bill to bring himself within the ambit of law, the Opposition, led by Congress, has opposed it ""to remain outside the law's ambit, run governments from jail and not relinquish their attachment to power.""""Now, the people of the country will have to decide whether it is appropriate for a minister, chief minister or the prime minister to run the government while in jail,"" he said in a series of posts on X in Hindi.Shah further said that in view of the Modi government’s commitment to fight political corruption and the public’s anger, he had introduced a Constitutional Amendment Bill in Parliament with the consent of the Lok Sabha Speaker. The bill ensures that important constitutional posts such as the prime minister, chief ministers and ministers at the Centre and in the states cannot run governments while being in jail.""The purpose of this Bill is to elevate the declining level of morality in public life and bring integrity to politics,"" he added.Brushing aside the opposition’s claims, BJP leader Anurag Thakur said, “The Opposition is opposing morality and honesty. Their unruly behaviour was shameful. Footage will show how they rushed towards the Union Home Minister, tore papers, and threw them at him. It is clear they are aligning with dishonesty. The Opposition has stooped so low in protesting against this bill.”BJP MP Sambit Patra also hit out at the Opposition, saying, “I don't think what the Opposition and Congress members did today in Parliament has ever happened in history. When the Union Home Minister was tabling the 130th Amendment, the Opposition tore the document and intimidated both the Speaker and the Union Home Minister. This black chapter has been written by the Opposition to safeguard corruption.”","The bills aim for the removal of prime minister, union minister, chief minister or state/ut minister of they are arrested or kept in custody for serious criminal charges for 30 consecutive days.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123407253,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1127543,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

When the body was handed over to Bhiwani Civil Hospital on August 13 for the first autopsy, the apparent cause of death mentioned in the Loharu police inquest report was described as ""Galat Kaam Karke, Gala Retkar Hatya (murder by slitting of throat after committing wrongful acts)"".The second post-mortem had been conducted at PGIMS-Rohtak. Police had on Monday cited it to say she had died of pesticide poisoning while her neck wounds were possibly caused by animals rather than any sharp-edged weapon. PGIMS-Rohtak medical superintendent Dr Kundan Mittal had said, ""We found poison in the samples sent to the lab. No semen traces were found. No acid was poured on the body, as had been initially claimed in media reports. ""The first postmortem was conducted at the civil hospital at 6.25 pm on August 13 at the request of Loharu police.The PMR - a copy of which is with TOI - records that police informed doctors that their initial impression was that her throat had been cut after sexual assault.In another column, the PMR says, ""The body was wearing a... yellow colour salwar found torn at the anterior superior aspect and 'nada (string)' found open intact in situ with struggle signs...""In the column on external injuries, only one has been mentioned - ""a lacerated wound with gnawing effects on margins of size 29.5x16cm was present horizontally over the front and both sides of the neck remaining a tissue tag on the posterior aspect of neck (sic)...

Yes, it shows integrity No, it was a political strategy

' I did not take any constitutional position until proven innocent'



NEW DELHI: Union minister Amit Shah called the charges, once brought against him, ""false"" on Wednesday, asserting that he adhered to constitutional principles by resigning from his post before his arrest.His remarks came during a heated exchange over the ""Bill"" that Shah tabled in the Lok Sabha, in response to Congress leader KC Venugopal’s query about his 2010 arrest during Parliament's monsoon session.The discussion occurred shortly after Shah introduced three bills in the Lower House, including the Constitution (One Hundred and Thirtieth Amendment) Bill, 2025. This bill proposes the removal of the Prime Minister or chief ministers facing corruption or serious offence charges if they remain in detention for 30 consecutive days.Additionally, the home minister tabled the Government of Union Territories (Amendment) Bill, 2025, and the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill, 2025. The latter seeks to amend section 54 of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, to allow for the removal of a chief minister or minister in the event of arrest or detention on serious criminal charges.During the session, Congress MP KC Venugopal questioned, “This bill is meant to sabotage the basic principles of the Constitution. BJP members are saying that this bill is to bring morality into politics. Can I ask the home minister a question? When he was the home minister of Gujarat, he was arrested – did he uphold morality at that time?”Responding sharply, Shah stated, “Now listen to me, I want to clear the record.False charges were levelled against me. I had resigned before being arrested out of a moral responsibility. And I didn't take up any post until I was acquitted by the courts...”Shah further requested Speaker Om Birla to refer the three bills to a Joint Committee of the Houses consisting of 21 members of the Lok Sabha and 10 members of the Rajya Sabha to be nominated by the Speaker and the deputy chairman, respectively. In July 2010, then Gujarat minister of state for home Amit Shah was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation in connection with the alleged fake encounter of gangster Sohrabuddin Sheikh, his wife Kauser Bi, and associate Tulsiram Prajapati.The agency implicated him in a conspiracy, presenting phone records and other evidence. Shah resigned from his ministerial position prior to the arrest and was remanded to judicial custody at Sabarmati Jail before securing bail later that year. In December 2014, a special CBI court discharged him from all charges due to a lack of evidence.After the heated argument in the Lok Sabha, Amit Shah took to his X account and slammed Congress. He said that when Congress ""falsely implicated him in a fabricated case and arrested"" him, Amit Shah resigned and didn't took any constitutional position until proven innocent by the Court.He also said that BJP leader LK Advani resigned from his post in the past when allegation was made against him.""Today, a Congress leader in the House also made a personal remark about me, saying that when Congress falsely implicated me in a fabricated case and had me arrested, I did not resign. I want to remind Congress that I had already resigned before being arrested, and even after being released on bail, I did not take any constitutional position until I was fully proven innocent by the court. The court dismissed the false case against me, stating that it was motivated by political vendetta,"" he said in a post on X.The home minister further added, ""The Bharatiya Janata Party and NDA have always stood for ethical values. Shri Lal Krishna Advani ji also resigned from his post as soon as allegations were made against him. On the other hand, the Congress party continues to carry forward the unethical tradition started by Smt. Indira Gandhi ji.""He claimed that the Congress had brought an ordinance to protect former Bihar chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav, which Congress leader Rahul Gandhi opposed and added that same Raebareli MP is now embracing him at Gandhi Maidan in Patna.""It was clear from the beginning that this bill would be placed before the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) of Parliament, where it would be thoroughly discussed. Yet, abandoning all shame and decency, the entire INDI alliance, led by Congress, gathered to oppose it with crude behavior to protect the corrupt,"" Amit Shah added.","Union minister amit shah called the charges, once brought against him, ""false"" he asserted that he adhered to constitutional principles by resigning from his post before his arrest.

Bill is in violation of presumption of innocence, says oppn in Lok Sabha



NEW DELHI: The ongoing acrimony between the opposition and the treasury, witnessed throughout the monsoon session of Parliament, reached a flashpoint in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday when Union home minister Amit Shah introduced the three bills that provide a legal framework for removing the Prime Minister, Union ministers, chief ministers, and ministers in states and Union territories arrested and detained on serious criminal charges.Shah said that the three legislations will be referred to a joint parliamentary committee for detailed scrutiny even as opposition MPs, essentially from Trinamool Congress and Congress, launched into aggressive protests and tore copies of the bills. They trooped into the well of the House, near Shah's front-row seat.Opposition MPs said the bills violated constitutional principles, undermined federalism, and inverted the principle of ""innocent until proven guilty."" They warned of potential misuse for political purposes and the risk of transforming India into a police state.Pandemonium broke out as soon as home minister Amit Shah sought to move the three bills — the Government of Union Territories (Amendment) Bill, 2025; the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill, 2025; and Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill, 2025 — which propose that if the PM, ministers or CMs are arrested and detained for 30 days for offences carrying a jail term of at least five years, they will lose their positions on the 31st day.Shah justified the legislations, “We cannot be so shameless (ham itne nirlajj nahi ho sakte) as to occupy constitutional positions while facing charges,” home minister said.Initially, only Trinamool MPs, led by Kalyan Banerjee, stormed the well. After Congress netas K C Venugopal and Manish Tewari spoke, Venugopal tore a copy of the bill, and Congress MPs joined TMC in protest. Venugopal questioned Shah’s claim of upholding public morality, referring to Shah’s 2010 arrest as Gujarat’s home minister.Shah countered, stating he had resigned on moral grounds before his arrest on “false” allegations and refrained from holding constitutional positions until cleared by courts. “I want to remind Congress that I had already resigned before being arrested, and even after being released on bail, I did not take any constitutional position until I was proven innocent by the court.” He added, “The court dismissed the false case against me, stating that it was motivated by political vendetta. ”Three opposition MPs — Asaduddin Owaisi (AIMIM), N K Premachandran (RSP) and Manish Tewari (Congress) — opposed the bill saying that it is in violation of presumption of innocence, which is the bedrock of administration and a marked assualt on the basic structure of the Constitution. Tewari called the bills “squarely destructive” to the Constitution’s basic structure, arguing they bypassed due process and made investigating officers the “boss of the Prime Minister”.Owaisi accused the govt of enabling executive agencies to act as judge, jury, and executioner based on flimsy allegations, likening the proposed system to Nazi Germany’s Gestapo. Venugopal claimed the bills aimed to sabotage India’s federal structure.Shah rejected Premachandran’s contention that the bills were brought in haste, saying they will be sent to a joint panel, where members of both Houses would get an opportunity to give their suggestions.The constitutional amendment bill requires two-thirds support in both Houses — a majority that the governing alliance currently lacks.One opposition MP twisted Shah’s mic, while others continued throwing bits of paper at him, prompting treasury MPs to rush into the well. MPs from both sides stood face-to-face, exchanging threats, and even after the House was adjourned, opposition MPs continued shouting slogans.BJP MPs, including ministers Kiren Rijiju and Ravneet Bittu, moved to block opposition MPs from approaching Shah. The home minister, however, asked his colleagues to return to their seats. Congress MP Deepender Hooda also intervened, preventing opposition MPs from entering the aisle. Normalcy returned only after Shah and other ministers left the House as the opposition members jeered.When House resumed an hour later, the bills were referred to JPC, but proceedings occurred under tight security, with marshals present. Shah, instead of taking his front row seat, sat in the third row as opposition MPs again occupied the well. Govt sources said that their focus was on getting the legislations passed.","Amit shah introduced the three bills that provide a legal framework for removing the prime minister, union ministers, chief ministers, and ministers in states and union territories arrested and detained on serious criminal charges.
