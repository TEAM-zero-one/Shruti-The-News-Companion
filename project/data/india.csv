SC refuses to stay demolition drive in Okhla encroachments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-refuses-to-stay-demolition-drive-in-okhla-encroachments/articleshow/121584770.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday rejected pleas of some residents of Muradi Road, Batla House, Jamia Nagar in Delhi to stop the impending demolition drive against encroachments and illegal constructions on land which were acquired by Delhi Development Authority more than 43 years ago.As many as 40 residents of the unauthorised colony through senior advocate Sanjay Hegde pleaded before a partial working day bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and A G Masih for a stay on the impending demolition drive citing the notices pasted in public places and unauthorised constructions asking the residents to vacate the place in 15 days.Senior advocates Guru Krishna Kumar and A D N Rao pointed out that the demolition drive is being carried out based on the SC’s May 7 order, which noticed that part of the unauthorised colony falls under Pm-UDAY Scheme under NCT Delhi (Recognition of Property Rights to Residents in Unauthorised Colonies) Regulations, 2019.The bench had directed the DDA “to take action of demolition in accordance with law in respect of the unauthorised structures of area of 2 bigha 10 biswas. The DDA shall file a compliance affidavit within a period of three months from today. We make it clear that when we say due process of law before demolishing any structure at least 15 days’ notice shall be served upon the concerned persons.”Justices Karol and Masih, who in principle do not want to dismiss any petition during the partial working day period, said the petition by residents of unauthorised colonies in Batla House area will be heard in July.Hegde said he apprehended that the authorities would act in full swing during the interregnum and pleaded for stay. But the bench refused.The petitioner said the colony comprises a diverse group of individuals, including retired police personnel, govt employees serving in various departments and public offices as well as women, children and senior citizens. Any banket order for demolition would affect their fundamental right to live and right to shelter.The DDA had issued notices on May 26 and 27 to many residents of unauthorised colonies in the Batla House area to vacate the land in question. “Several affected properties, including those situated at Muradi Road, Batla House, are presently inhabited by families who have resided in the locality for decades, and who possess documentary proof of possession, such as electricity bills, house tax receipts, water bills, General Power of Attorney (GPA) documents, and sanctioned building plans. Yet, in spite of their legitimate claims, these residents have been denied an opportunity to be heard, and are now at imminent risk of displacement,” the petitioners claimed.","The supreme court rejected pleas of some residents of muradi road, batla house, jamia nagar in delhi to stop the impending demolition drive.

SC seeks Union’s response; plea challenges ‘push back’

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday sought the Centre’s response to a petition by a man alleging that his mother, released after detention of three years following a Foreigner Tribunal identifying her as a Bangladeshi, may have been forcibly pushed into Bangladesh despite her plea against the tribunal’s order pending in SC since 2017.Appearing for Iunuch Ali, senior advocate Kapil Sibal told a partial working day bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and A G Masih that she was picked up by Dhubri police and allegedly pushed back into Bangladesh.“How can the Dhubri SP determine whether she is a Bangladeshi immigrant? Was she produced before a magistrate after being detained? The son does not know her whereabouts. The Centre must inform him about her whereabouts,” Sibal said. SC issued notice to Centre on this plea.Sibal also questioned the ‘push back’ of illegal Bangladeshi migrants and this is unknown to the process of law. He said the only legal process available is ‘deportation’. The petitioner said, “The law does not recognize push back, i.e arresting foreign nationals and taking them to the international border and either casting them away or pushing them across international borders without any verification and acceptance by the authorities of the other country.This is illegal, not permitted by any law.”Petitioner's mother Monowara Bewa was declared a foreigner by Dhubri Foreigners Tribunal on March 17, 2016. The Gauhati HC upheld the tribunal’s order on Feb 28, 2017. Her appeal against the HC order is pending adjudication in the SC for the last eight years.In the meantime, the SC in another case in 2019 ordered that foreigners cannot be kept in detention indefinitely and must be either deported to their native country or released on bail. The Centre had said that deportation is dependent on the host country accepting their citizen. Based on this 2019 judgment, Bewa was released in Dec 2019.She was detained again on May 24, as the drive against illegal Bangladeshi immigrants picked pace after the terror attack on tourists at Pahalgam and the ‘Op Sindoor’ by Indian armed forces against terrorist bases in Pakistan. The petitioner said her detention was in violation of her rights guaranteed under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution.","Supreme court seeks union’s response; plea challenges ‘push back’ of illegal bangladeshi migrants.

Jaipur royal family wants state to return 140-year-old Town Hall: SC to decide whether claim justified as per 1949 merger covenant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jaipur-royal-family-wants-state-to-return-140-year-old-town-hall-sc-to-decide-whether-claim-justified-as-per-1949-merger-covenant/articleshow/121584176.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to examine whether a pre-Constitution Covenant facilitating merger of Jaipur princely state with Dominion of India decide the ownership right of the royal family over 145-year-old Sawai Man Singh Town Hall, or Old Vidhan Sabha now proposed to be converted into a Heritage Museum?Or are the jurisdiction of the courts, including the SC, is ousted under Article 363 of the Constitution from entertaining any dispute arising from treaties and Covenants entered between any ruler of an Indian state and to which the government of the Dominion of India or any of its predecessor governments was a party.The state’s Oct 2022 decision to convert the building, used as state assembly from 1952 till the 1990s, as heritage museum alarmed the royal family members of the attempt to erase their ownership over the property, which according to them was acknowledged in the March 1949 Covenant signed between government of India and United states of Rajasthan.Under the agreed terms of the Covenant, the princely states of Banswara, Bikaner, Bundi, Dungarpur, Jaipur, Jaisalmer, Jhalawar, Jodhpur, Kishangarh, Kota, Mewar, Pratapgarh, Shahpur and Tonk merged with Dominion of India. Under the Covenant, the title of the private properties of the princely state rulers would continue to vest in them.For the Jaipur royal family, senior advocates Harish Salve and Vibha D Makhija said Article 363 - which bars the jurisdiction of the courts, including that of the SC - to entertain any dispute arising from treaty or Covenant needs to be given a restrictive meaning as it cannot extinguish titles of royal families over their private properties.A partial working day bench comprising Justices Prashant K Mishra and A G Masih was initially reluctant to entertain the petition as it apprehended that this would enable the heirs of erstwhile rulers of princely states to lay claim over huge tracts of land and villages owned by them earlier. But Salve said it pertains to only a few properties mentioned in the Covenant and not for widening the title rights over villages.When the bench issued notice to the Rajasthan govt, its additional advocate general Shiv M Sharma and advocate Kartikeya informed the court that it would honour the pendency of the case before the HC and not precipitate the issue.The state govt’s Oct 2022 decision to convert the Town Hall into a heritage museum had forced the royal family members to file a civil suit seeking possession of the property. Though the suit was entertained, the trial court refused to stay the proposed conversion into a museum.The state moved the HC questioning maintainability of the suit in the face of clear bar under Article 363. The royal family members moved HC for interim injunction against the museum. The HC rejected the plea for status quo. When they challenged the HC order, the SC too refused to stay on the proposed museum but ordered an expeditious decision on the suit. On Apr 17 this year, the HC on state’s appeal ruled that the royal family members’ suit against the state under the Covenant is barred under Article 363.","Court to examine whether a pre-constitution covenant decides the ownership right of the royal family over 145-year-old sawai man singh town hall, or old vidhan sabha.

Amit Kumar Singal, a 2007-batch IRS officer serving as Additional Director General at the Directorate of Taxpayer Services, was arrested alongside his associate Harsh Kotak in connection with an alleged bribe of Rs 25 lakh.CBI officials confirmed on Monday that raids at Singal’s residences in Delhi and Punjab led to the seizure of approximately Rs 1 crore in cash, 3.5 kg of gold, and 2 kg of silver. The operation followed a complaint by Sanam Kapoor, owner of La Pino’z Pizza, who alleged that Singal demanded a total of Rs 45 lakh to settle an income tax notice issued earlier this year.According to the complaint, Singal had leveraged his previous position as Joint Commissioner in the Customs Department, Mumbai, to establish business connections with Kapoor, including a franchise agreement via Parker Impex, a firm registered in his mother's name. Additional contracts were reportedly arranged with other firms linked to Kotak and his family. After a business dispute, Kapoor alleged he was pressured into buying back outlets at inflated rates.Following the fallout, Singal allegedly influenced the issuance of an income tax notice against Kapoor in February 2025.Kapoor’s chartered accountant was informed that a substantial penalty was likely due to Singal’s influence. In April, Kapoor met Singal at his Delhi office, where the officer allegedly demanded Rs 45 lakh and issued threats of legal action and financial penalties.Acting on Kapoor’s detailed complaint, the CBI verified the claims, including a four-hour covert recording of discussions between the parties on 30 May. The next day, the agency conducted a trap operation in Mohali, where Kotak was allegedly caught accepting the first instalment of the bribe on Singal’s behalf.Singal was subsequently arrested from his residence in Delhi’s Vasant Kunj. Both men have been remanded in judicial custody until 13 June, according to Kapoor’s lawyer, Gagandeep Jammu.","Amit kumar singal is a 2007-batch irs officer serving as additional director general at the directorate of taxpayer services.

For the 5+ age group, male literacy was 85.6% and female literacy was 73.7%.States with the lowest literacy rates in the age 7+ category were Bihar (74.3%), Madhya Pradesh (75.2%), and Rajasthan (75.8%). In the 5+ age group, Bihar again ranked lowest at 73.2%, followed by Madhya Pradesh (73.7%) and Rajasthan (74.9%).Urban India continues to report higher literacy levels than rural areas. The national urban literacy rate was 88.9% for persons aged seven years and above, compared to 77.5% in rural areas.

NEW DELHI: The death of a 9-year-old Dalit girl after a brutal rape in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur has triggered outrage across the country. As allegations of medical negligence and administrative failure emerge, here are 10 things to know about the case that has prompted interventions from the NHRC, NCW, and national leaders:On May 26, the minor girl was allegedly lured with chocolate near her aunt’s house and taken to a maize field where she was raped and physically assaulted. She sustained serious neck and internal injuries.She was first admitted to Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur. Due to her critical condition, she was referred to Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) on May 30.According to her uncle, the child was kept waiting for 2-3 hours inside an ambulance outside PMCH before being admitted. Despite her condition, proper care was allegedly delayed, and the family claims she was only admitted after they raised a ruckus.The family alleged that doctors gave the child sedatives through the night, and she died the next morning. They also claimed they had to spend Rs 25,000 at the government hospital.The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) took suo motu cognisance and issued notices to the chief secretary and DGP of Bihar, calling the incident a serious human rights violation.A detailed report has been sought within two weeks.National Commission for Women (NCW) Chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar also took suo motu cognisance, demanding a probe into the role of the hospital authorities and police, and calling the delay in treatment ""gross negligence.""RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav accused the Nitish Kumar-led NDA government of prioritising elections over justice.

‘Made a mistake of giving financial benefit to all women’: Ajit Pawar on Ladki Bahin scheme; Uddhav Sena cries voter bribe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/made-a-mistake-of-giving-financial-benefit-to-all-women-ajit-pawar-on-ladki-bahin-scheme-uddhav-sena-cries-voter-bribe/articleshow/121574928.cms,"NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Monday admitted that the state government made a ""mistake"" in extending financial benefits to all applicants of the Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana without sufficient scrutiny, attributing the lapse to time constraints ahead of last year’s assembly elections.“We made a mistake of giving the financial benefit to all women (applicants). We had little time to scrutinise the applications and identify the ineligible ones. At that time, elections were supposed to be announced in two to three months,” news agency PTI reported Pawar as saying.The Ladki Bahin scheme, launched in August 2024, offers Rs 1,500 per month to eligible women aged 21 to 65 years with an annual income below Rs 2.5 lakh. Though it was designed to empower poor women, scrutiny revealed thousands of ineligible recipients, including over 2,200 government employees.Pawar, who also heads the state’s finance department, clarified that the aid already deposited will not be withdrawn. “When the scheme was unveiled, the government had appealed that only eligible women apply but that didn't happen. A scrutiny is being conducted. Only the needy women will get the monthly payout,” he said.His admission drew strong reactions from the opposition. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut demanded Pawar’s resignation, accusing him of enabling a misuse of public funds to gain electoral advantage. Raut said the finance department had presided over a “loot of government money for the sake of votes”.Earlier, Maharashtra minister Aditi Tatkare confirmed the government had disqualified 2,289 ineligible government employees after examining nearly two lakh applications. In a recent post on X, she assured the public that such scrutiny would continue regularly. “After realising this, such beneficiaries are not being given the benefit of the scheme,” she wrote.The Ladki Bahin scheme was credited with boosting the Mahayuti alliance’s performance in the November 2024 assembly elections. However, it has also led to budgetary strain. Social Justice Minister Sanjay Shirsat conceded that the government was under pressure, saying, “It is a reality that the monthly amount of Rs 1,500 cannot be raised to Rs 2,100.” He added that the scheme would continue even if it required the state to borrow funds.Shirsat also criticised the finance department for diverting funds from his ministry without notice. In March, he alleged that Rs 7,000 crore had been slashed from the Social Justice Department’s budget, and on Monday, he called for a law to protect such departments from arbitrary cuts.According to official guidelines, beneficiaries must meet income and residency criteria and provide Aadhaar-linked bank accounts. Newly married women can present a marriage certificate if their name does not appear on a ration card. While the scheme aims to support women’s economic independence, the government now faces growing scrutiny over its execution.","Maharashtra deputy chief minister ajit pawar said the state government made a ""mistake"" in extending financial benefits to all applicants.

'Poor Hygiene': Influencer Sharmishta Panoli Files Plea In Kolkata Court Over Jail Conditions

Pawan Kalyan, Kangana Ranaut condemn arrest

NEW DELHI: Social media influencer and law student Sharmishta Panoli's advocate has claimed that her basic rights are being denied in custody and that her health is deteriorating. Her advocate has filed a plea regarding the conditions at the correctional, alleging that ""proper hygiene is not being maintained.""Panoli is currently lodged in Alipore women’s correctional home following her arrest on May 30 for allegedly hurting religious sentiments through a now-deleted Instagram video.Speaking to reporters, Panoli’s advocate Md Samimuddin said, “We are trying our best to get her out of jail before June 13. We will sit down on the matter today and discuss it. We will take a call in one or two days about what we will do... At Alipore women’s correctional home, proper hygiene is not being maintained around her and she is unwell. She has kidney stones. She is not being given access to newspapers and magazines. Today we have filed a petition in the court so that she gets access to her basic rights... Sharmishta is innocent. We are trying our best to get her out on bail.”The 22-year-old was arrested by Kolkata Police from Gurugram, Haryana, after multiple failed attempts to serve her legal notices. The police claimed she and her family had absconded. On June 1, a Kolkata court remanded her to 14-day judicial custody until June 13. Her bail plea has since been filed, and her legal team contends that with her phone and laptop already seized, custody is unnecessary.Despite deleting the video and publicly apologising on May 15, Panoli’s arrest has stirred political and legal controversy. Kolkata Police insist the arrest was lawful and based on a court-issued warrant after repeated non-compliance with legal procedures. “All legal procedures were duly adhered to,” they posted on X, calling social media claims of an “unlawful arrest” “factually incorrect and misleading.”The police further clarified that Panoli was not arrested for any nationalist sentiment but under the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) for spreading communal disharmony. “Hate speech & abusive language should not be misconstrued as freedom of speech,” their statement added.Nevertheless, growing voices from the legal community are calling for her release. The Bar Council of Delhi condemned her arrest as excessive and politically motivated. Chairman Surya Prakash Khatri said, “Despite deleting the video and apologising, she was arrested in a high-handed manner... I demand her immediate release to uphold the scale of justice.” Bar Council of India chairperson Manan Kumar Mishra echoed similar concerns.Andhra Pradesh deputy chief minister Pawan Kalyan had also earlier criticised the West Bengal Police for arresting Panoli, saying that “secularism must be a two-way street.”In a post on X, he noted, “During Operation Sindoor, Sharmistha, a law student, spoke out, her words regrettable and hurtful to some. She owned her mistake, deleted the video and apologised. The WB Police swiftly acted, taking action against Sharmistha. But what about the deep, searing pain inflicted upon millions when elected leaders, MPs of TMC, mock Sanatana Dharma? Where is the outrage when our faith is called 'Gandha Dharm'? Where is their apology? Where is their swift arrest?” He added,“Blasphemy must be condemned, always! Secularism isn't a shield for some and a sword for others. It must be a two-way street. West Bengal Police, the nation is watching. Act justly for all.”Kangana Ranaut described the arrest as harsh. “She is a very young woman. She has her whole career and life ahead of her,” Ranaut said.","Sharmishta panoli was arrested on may 30 for allegedly hurting religious sentiments through a now-deleted instagram video.

MUMBAI: Rajit Gupta of Kota emerged at the top of the JEE Advanced 2025 rank list, securing 332 out of 360 marks. Gupta, whose father himself ranked 48th in Rajasthan's Pre Engineering Test of 1994, will join IIT Bombay 's computer science department.Nipping at Gupta's heels, Saksham Jindal from Hisar in Haryana, the son of doctor parents, matched his score but fell just short on tie-breaking metrics - based on higher positive marks. Gupta got 335 and Jindal got 333. Majid Husain stood third with 330. This year the list saw more ties - ranks 6 and 7 both scored 321, and 8 and 9 shared a score of 319 - making the race not just close, but highly competitive.The coaching hub of Kota, often in the news for negative reasons, had cause to celebrate Monday as an unprecedented 42 from the city ranked in the top 100 - its best showing since the exam's current format was adopted in 2013.Devdutta Majhi from West Bengal, who gave up her violin during her JEE Advanced preparation, emerged as the top-ranking female candidate in the country. With an All-India Rank of 16 and a score of 312, her preparation was largely self-led, with some mock tests and doubt-solving sessions. She also turned to her mother to clear her doubts. In Aug, she will join the Indian Institute of Science.Of the 1.8 lakh candidates who sat through both the papers on May 18, only 54,378 made it past the finish line. Among them, 9,404 are women. It was not just the achievers that drew attention - this year, the cutoffs also reduced. The minimum qualifying marks for the general category nosedived to 74 from last year's 109. With just 7 marks needed per subject-physics, chemistry and math-the subject-wise cutoff also reduced, down from 10 a year ago.Across social categories, the dip was uniform. OBC and Economically Weaker Sections candidates needed 66 marks (18.5%), while SC/ST candidates qualified at 37 marks-10.28% - with a subject-wise minimum of 3.While students from the IIT Bombay zone dominated the upper echelons of the merit list, it was the IIT Hyderabad zone - encompassing the southern states - that sent the largest cohort across the qualifying line. As many as 13,000 candidates from this zone made the cut. Close on its heels was the IIT Delhi zone, with 11,370 qualifiers, followed by the IIT Bombay zone, contributing 11,226 aspirants to the pool of those eligible for counselling.Analysis showed that the top 10 ranks closed at 317 this year, down from 329 in 2024. Sreedhar Babu, a math mentor and IIT Bombay alumnus, said, ""The paper was long. Some students who followed the linear order - chemistry, then physics, then math - ended up losing steam midway.""

Bhubaneswar: Security forces on Monday recovered another 2.5 tonnes of explosives, six days after Maoists looted a stone quarry truck in Sundargarh district. The joint operation led by Odisha police involved multiple agencies, including the special operations group (SOG), district voluntary force (DVF), India Reserve Battalion (IRB), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), and Jharkhand's Jaguars. By Friday, around 30 per cent of stolen materials had been recovered.""Odisha police have been working day and night on a sustained basis to ensure that the entire looted explosive consignment is recovered. All due care is being taken for safety of personnel searching for the explosive materials in the forest,"" said DGP Y B Khurania. The joint effort is being overseen by top police officers of both states.The recovery operation involved deep search metal detectors (DSMD) to locate explosives buried underground and concealed beneath dry leaves in a forest area along the Odisha-Chhattisgarh border, said DIG (western range) Brijesh Rai. ""SOG is leading the other forces in the search operation. We still have 1.5 tonnes of explosives left to recover. There are natural craters in the forest, which the Maoists have used to hide the explosives. So far, we know that the ultras have hidden the explosives within a four km stretch of forest,"" the DIG added.Investigation earlier revealed that the quarry owner didn't follow the protocol to transport the explosives, as the route the truck moved was isolated.Police are also in the dark as Maoists removed the video recorder of CCTV installed in the quarry. According to police, quarry owner Shraban Agrawal has an explosive licence in his name and another in his wife's name. Police are probing the details of stocks and recent deliveries.On May 27, armed Maoists hijacked the explosives-laden truck from a place close to Banko stone quarry. They took the truck into the forest and fled with the explosive packets, which included mostly gelatine sticks and detonators used in stone blasting. The site of the loot was adjacent to Saranda forest, a Maoist den in West Singhbhum district of Jharkhand.","Odisha police recover 2.5 tonnes of explosives, six days after maoists looted a stone quarry truck in sundargarh district.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu, Tripura and Delhi have emerged as top performers in tackling the challenge of adult literacy and education. The 2024-25 Foundational Literacy and Numeracy Assessment Test (FLNAT), conducted under ULLAS - Nav Bharat Saaksharta Karyakram, has thrown up encouraging results among states that submitted the certification data in time.Data compiled by the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS), exclusively accessed by TOI, showed that the top performers ranged in the late 90s in terms of success percentages, while the relative laggards - Uttarakhand, Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh - were over 85%.The FLNAT programme was rolled out in phases between July 2024 and March 2025, with over 1.77 crore adult learners tested in all.By May 2025, only 34.3 lakh were officially certified, reflecting a national average of about 19.4%. However, this figure is skewed due to pending certification data from the March 2025 phase, which included over 49 lakh participants whose results were still being processed.Under FLNAT, which is a nationwide assessment of foundational literacy and numeracy skills, ""states/UTs identify illiterate populations, educate them, and then conduct a test to reveal outcomes,"" said a senior official of ministry of education (MoE).TN recorded a flawless performance, certifying all 5,09,694 learners who appeared in FLNAT - a 100% success rate. ""This is attributed to strong administrative oversight, pre-exam preparation, and local mobilisation through community volunteers and panchayat support,"" the official said. Tripura was close behind, certifying 13,909 of 14,179 learners, with a success rate of 98.1%. Delhi also performed exceptionally, certifying 7,901 of 7,959 candidates, with a 99.3% success rate.On the other hand, states like Uttarakhand, Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh posted lower certification rates despite moderate participation. Uttarakhand certified 8,109 of 9,459 learners (85.7%); Gujarat, 1,853 of 2,128 (87.1%); and Himachal Pradesh, 14,500 of 15,351 candidates (88.3%). ""While these states didn't perform poorly in absolute terms, their outcomes were among the lowest of those with fully declared results,"" said a senior official of department of school education and literacy.One encouraging finding is the high participation of women. In Madhya Pradesh, more women appeared in FLNAT than men - 8.52 lakh versus 8.11 lakh men. Similar trends were seen in Jharkhand and Odisha. This indicates a growing awareness and desire for literacy among adult women, who increasingly see education as a means of empowerment and dignity.","The flnat programme was rolled out in phases between july 2024 and march 2025. Tamil nadu recorded a flawless performance, certifying all 5,09,694 learners who appeared in flnat - a 100% success rate.
