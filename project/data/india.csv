RAJKOT: A consumer court in Gujarat's Jamnagar has directed LIC of India to pay Rs 12 lakh with 6% interest to a policyholder whose husband died of a heart attack in 2022. The court also ordered LIC to pay Rs 5,000 as compensation for mental harassment and Rs 3,000 towards legal expenses, holding that rejection of the claim amounted to ""deficiency in service. ""According to the complaint, Bharat Sheth died on Nov 16, 2022. He had two LIC policies worth a total of Rs 12 lakh, both issued on Nov 15, 2019. LIC rejected the claim of his widow, Neha Sheth stating that the policy had not completed three years and that the deceased had allegedly concealed information about being diabetic.Neha contended that her husband had held multiple LIC policies and had undergone LIC's medical tests before issuance, which did not indicate diabetes. She argued that any mention of diabetes in hospital records may have been due to side effects of medication during treatment for brain tumour.Court noted that LIC's own records showed no pre-existing illness and there was no provision in policy allowing claim rejection based on diabetes. It concluded that LIC had acted unfairly in denying the claim.","Life insurance corporation (lic) of india ordered to pay rs 12 lakh with 6% interest to a policyholder whose husband died of a heart attack in 2022.

The 29-year-old woman called on Seechewal at Sultanpur Lodhi to thank him for his effort to rescue her. She said she left for Iraq on Jan 8, 2024. The 'agent' promised her a tailoring job, weekly holidays, and permission to use a phone to contact her family but the reality was completely opposite, she said.Once in Iraq, she was forced to work as a domestic servant, she said. The employer tried to assault her, and when she resisted and recorded a video as evidence, she was brutally beaten at the behest of the agent and his wife, she said.

"Chinese behind most crypto, loan app rip-offs: ED report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chinese-behind-most-crypto-loan-app-rip-offs-ed-report/articleshow/124886084.cms,"NEW DELHI: As the magnitude of cybercrime and the number of its victims continue to rise and has warranted Supreme Court's intervention, a report prepared by Enforcement Directorate shows that while domestic players have been primarily engaged in digital arrest and other such frauds, Chinese nationals have almost acquired dominance over loan app- and cryptocurrency-related rip-offs.The agency has already initiated a probe in many of these cases involving Chinese fraudsters, and an estimated Rs 28,000 crore in crime proceeds has been identified.The involvement of Chinese nationals and their control over illegal loan apps came to light after ED started probing LoanPro, FastCredit, SmartRupee and other similar loan apps over the past few years. The money trail in these cases showed that thousands of people were tricked across more than 20 states in the country. Many were bullied and blackmailed when they failed to meet the stringent repayment conditions, even leading to suicides.While these illegal ""instant loan"" apps charged hefty platform fees in the range of 30-40% of total loan amount, deducted at the time of disbursement, the term of the credit extended from 7 to 15 days.While Chinese nationals were found to be controlling these syndicates from abroad, their Indian associates ran the operations in the country from behind a veil of NBFCs and fintech and shell entities for laundering the crime proceeds.Indian and foreign payment gateways were also found involved in facilitating these transactions - some of them have already been questioned by the central agency.In many cases, the crime proceeds were converted into cryptocurrencies and siphoned off to China. In other cases, the perpetrators routed the booty as payments for fake imports from Hong Kong and other Chinese territories.According to the probe agency, these apps used a consortium of Chinese seed capital, NBFCs, fintech companies and payment aggregators. Shinebay Technologies, for instance, operated loan apps (LoanPro, FastCredit, SmartRupee, etc) that lent money at exorbitant interest rates for 7-15 days terms. Borrowers paid 30-40% of the loan amount at time of disbursement as platform fees. Private phone data of borrowers were hacked and used for blackmail in case of default, leading to several cases of suicide.In the case of HPZ Token, a cryptocurrency mining scheme, at least 10 Chinese nationals were found to have collected over Rs 2,200 crore from people across 20 states, and the alleged 'proceeds of crime' were sent out using payment gateways. As much as Rs 500 crore of this was frozen by ED with payment gateways after the scam was unearthed.In a case where investors were offered very high returns on investments using an online app 'LOXAM', the probe agency in July this year arrested a money changer who was found to have assisted a Chinese national in remittance of more than Rs 900 crore of ""proceeds of crime"" out of the country in a matter of just seven months.The arrested accused, Rohit Vij, converted Rs 903 crore into foreign currencies through his Ranjan Money Corp and KDS Forex, and helped Chinese national take the money out of the country.","Chinese nationals have almost acquired dominance over loan app- and cryptocurrency-related rip-offs.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab and Haryana HC said a soldier wounded when he fell into a nullah while searching for terrorists during a counter-insurgency operation was entitled to war injury benefits, adding even accidental injury in action in an operational area was treated as a battle casualty.A division bench of Justice Harsimran Singh and Justice Vikas Suri HC passed the order while dismissing a petition filed by central govt challenging a Nov 22, 2023, order of Chandigarh bench of Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT), granting war injury pension to Havildar Sanjeeb Kumar.Centre's counsel argued although Havildar Sanjeeb was permanently released under low medical category on Nov 30, 2020, for 'fracture distal radius' (wrist fracture) and granted disability pension, AFT's order of war injury pension was incorrect. Soldier's counsel contended he was searching for terrorists during his counter-insurgency duty along the Line of Control when he fell into Panar Nullah and got injured.After hearing both parties, HC held operations specifically notified by govt from time to time had been treated under Category E, and any disability arising out of these operations had to be treated as 'battle casualty'.

Takeaway

NEW DELHI: A Dubai-based Indian traveller has won a legal battle at the Delhi High Court after Customs seized his luxury Rolex watch at the Indira Gandhi International Airport , wrongly classifying it as a “commercial quantity.” The passenger had challenged the Customs order, and the Court ruled that a single high-value watch cannot automatically be treated as goods meant for trade, allowing him to redeem it upon payment of the prescribed fine.The case centres around incident from March 2024, when Mahesh, an Indian citizen residing in Dubai, arrived at Delhi Airport wearing a Rolex Submariner worth around Rs 12.7 lakh. Believing he had no dutiable goods, he passed through the Green Channel- reserved for passengers without items requiring declaration. Customs officers intercepted him, seized the watch, and issued a detention receipt, claiming non-declaration and categorising the watch as a “commercial quantity.”A division bench of Justices Pratibha M Singh and Sahil Jain delivered the verdict, noting that while the Customs Department acted correctly in detaining the item for non-declaration, it erred in categorising one luxury watch as goods meant for trade.The case involved Mahesh, an Indian citizen residing in Dubai, who was intercepted by Customs officers at Delhi Airport in March 2024 after walking through the Green Channel.His Rolex watch was seized for alleged non-declaration. An Order-in-Original passed earlier this year allowed redemption of the watch after payment of a fine, but labelled it a “commercial quantity”- prompting Mahesh to challenge the decision before the High Court.The bench observed that although the Customs Commissioner correctly permitted redemption, the classification of a single Rolex as a commercial import was “unsustainable.”“Clearly, this Court is of the view that one Rolex watch cannot be held to be a commercial quantity, and there is no reason why the same cannot be kept for personal use,” the judges said.However, the Court maintained that the declaration requirement and duty liability for high-value personal articles remain valid under law. The bench allowed redemption on payment of the existing fine by October 31, reiterating that travellers must exercise diligence when carrying luxury or high-value items through Indian airports.The ruling serves as an important clarification for both travellers and enforcement authorities — that while non-declaration attracts penalties, mere possession of an expensive personal item does not imply commercial intent.Under India’s customs baggage rules, every arriving passenger must declare dutiable, restricted, or high-value items, regardless of whether they are for personal use.A declaration is mandatory if a traveller carries:Travellers falling under these categories must use the Red Channel and fill out a Customs Declaration Form upon arrival, as opposed to the Green Channel which is for anyone not carrying any items that require declaration/customs duty.Children below ten years are entitled to half the adult limit, and pooling allowances within a family is not permitted.Luxury goods such as watches, designer accessories, and high-end electronics are not considered personal effects under Customs law. Even when used or worn, these must be declared if they exceed Rs 50,000 in value.For jewellery, men returning after a year abroad can bring up to Rs 10,000 duty-free, while women can bring jewellery worth Rs 20,000. Any excess is assessed for duty at arrival.Failure to declare dutiable or restricted goods can lead to:In Mahesh’s case, the court upheld that Customs acted within its powers in detaining the watch but clarified that the seizure should not have treated the item as a trade import.The High Court’s ruling provides relief in one individual case but carries a broader message for international travellers — high-value personal items like luxury watches must still be declared at Customs counters subject to conditions. Wearing such goods does not exempt them from declaration.In simple terms, declaration ensures lawful clearance and avoids the risk of confiscation, penalties, or prolonged litigation — as illustrated by the Rolex case itself.","The case involved mahesh, an indian citizen residing in dubai, who was intercepted by customs officers at delhi airport in march 2024 after walking through the green channel.

Cyclone Montha: Army, NDRF On Alert As Twin Cyclonic Systems Build Up In Arabian Sea & Bay Of Bengal

Odisha, TN to get rain





KAKINADA (ANDHRA PRADESH): Cyclonic storm Montha in Bay of Bengal was on Monday headed towards Andhra Pradesh, where it’s expected to cross the coast between Machilipatnam and Kalingapatnam after making a landfall near Kakinada around midnight on Tuesday before moving towards southern Odisha.The season’s first major storm, currently centred over west-central Bay of Bengal and moving northnorthwestward, is expected to intensify into a “severe cyclonic storm” before making landfall with wind speeds of 90-100 kilometres per hour and gusts up to 110 kmph.Andhra Pradesh govt has put the districts of Kakinada, Konaseema, West Godavari, Eluru and East Godavari on high alert. CM N Chandrababu Naidu has asked officials to prevent any cyclone-related deaths.Civil supplies minister Nadendla Manhor, the incharge minister for Eluru, who held a review meeting at Kakinada collectorate on Monday, said 269 rehabilitation centres have been set up with all facilities, while 30 NDRF and 50 SDRF teams have been pressed into service. Earthmovers, tractors and generators with enough fuel stocks have been kept ready.“Nearly 140 pregnant women from nearby villages have been shifted to hospitals.Essential goods and medicines have been kept ready, and holidays have been declared for all educational institutions till Wednesday. All fishing boats have been recalled from the sea,” he said.While Andhra Pradesh will bear the brunt of the storm, with red and orange alerts issued for 23 districts, the south-coastal districts of neighbouring Odisha are likely to witness heavy rainfall and strong winds. The northern districts of Tamil Nadu, including Chennai, are expected to receive heavy rains.Meanwhile, in Odisha, the state govt on Monday evacuated 3,000 people from vulnerable areas as the storm triggered rain across Bhubaneswar and southern parts of the state.Among those evacuated are 1,496 women in advanced stages of pregnancy, who have been shifted to hospitals.As many as 140 teams from NDRF, ODRAF and fire services personnel have been deployed, while schools and anganwadi centres have been shut in eight red zone districts till Thursday.Authorities are closely monitoring Gajapati, Rayagada, Koraput and Malkangiri districts for possible landslides.","Andhra braces for cyclone’s landfall today.

Andhra Braces for Cyclone Montha Landfall; IMD Warns of Heavy Rain, Strong Winds

Sea turns violent in Kakinada, floods homes, tears up roads

KAIKNADA/BHUBANESWAR: Cyclone Montha roared ashore on the eastern coast Tuesday night, slamming into Andhra Pradesh between Machilipatnam and Kalingapatnam near Kakinada with winds topping 100km an hour and sheets of rain that ripped through towns, snapped power lines, and sent waves surging 10ft high.The season's first major cyclone made landfall as a severe storm around 7.30pm, its crossing lasting nearly 4 hours. Trees lay strewn across highways, power poles twisted in the wind, and rescue teams battled driving rain to clear the roads. A woman died in Makanapalem village of Mamidikuduru mandal when a tree crashed onto her home.Across the border in Odisha, Montha's outer bands brought torrential rain and winds up to 100kmph through Ganjam and Gajapati districts, blocking roads and toppling trees. No casualties were reported, but landslides cut off stretches of R Udayagiri, Parlakhemundi, Huma, and Kashipur.The sea turned violent at Uppada in Kakinada district, flooding homes and tearing up the coastal road. Police sealed the Kakinada-Uppada beach road after waves breached embankments. As the cyclone's eye passed inland, thousands huddled in shelters, waiting for the storm to pass. Over 10,000 Andhra residents, mostly fishing families, were evacuated from 65 villages in 12 coastal mandals before landfall.Kakinada district collector S Shan Mohan said two NDRF teams and one SDRF unit were in the field, backed by 200 swimmers and 140 boats. ""Helipads have been kept ready to airlift people from submerged areas as and when required,"" he said. More than 12,000 people took shelter in 76 cyclone relief centres. Nearly 1,000 heads of cattle were moved to safer ground.Eight flights were cancelled at Rajahmundry airport, disrupting connections to Tirupati, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Mumbai.In Odisha, state govt opened over 2,000 cyclone shelters and deployed 158 emergency teams - five NDRF, 30 ODRAF, and 123 fire service units - to lead rescue and relief work. CM Mohan Majhi reviewed operations and said that 11,000 vulnerable people had been moved to safety under the ""zero casualty"" mission. ""Another 30,000 could be evacuated if conditions worsen,"" he said.Deputy chief minister KV Singhdeo said crop damage was extensive and promised aid once district reports arrive within a week.IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said Montha's impact would linger through Wednesday, bringing heavy to extremely heavy rainfall to southern Odisha before weakening over Chhattisgarh. Wind speeds could reach 80kmph as the system moves inland.Regional IMD chief Manorama Mohanty said rainfall will taper off by Friday, with lingering showers Thursday in interior Odisha.","The season's first major cyclone made landfall as a severe storm around 7.30pm.

Battle for Bihar: Sanjay Jha Reaffirms NDA Will Fight Assembly Polls Under Nitish Kumar's Leadership

NEW DELHI: In the run up to Bihar assembly poll announcement, Nitish Kumar was seen as NDA's weak link - his fitness under scrutiny, focus on CM's gaffes in and outside legislatures, the image of 'sushashan babu' fraying as sensational murders and collapse of bridges made national headlines allowing RJD-led Mahagathbandhan to home in on him.Halfway into the campaign, his challenger Tejashwi Yadav of RJD was goading voters by claiming that BJP will not repeat Nitish as CM if NDA retains power. But, as if on cue, BJP member and deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary said he will remain the CM, its poll in-charge and Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan insisted there is no vacancy for CM's post and other allies like Chirag Paswan and Jitan Ram Manjhi endorsed his leadership.As polling day nears, the JD(U) president remains not only NDA's most dependable face in state, but also someone whom large sections continue to look up to. His party's strength has declined in the assembly over successive elections but he continues to be seen as the alliance's most assured bridge to victory.His arch rival Lalu Prasad's derisive sobriquet of 'Paltu Ram', a colloquial turn on his frequent switches between the two rival alliances in state, appeared to have stuck for a while.But what has endured for his supporters is his deliverance of Bihar from the 15-year govt of Lalu and his wife Rabri Devi, a period dubbed as 'jungle raj' by NDA for its alleged lawlessness and retreat of state from various spheres of public life.Nitish is credited for restoration of basics of governance in his 20-long years in office, save for nine months of Jitan Ram Manjhi between 2014 and 2015. A quality road network, reliable power supply with electricity reaching almost every village by 2016, state's turn to the rule of law, and partial gains in school education and healthcare, at least at primary level, are considered undeniable successes of his era.While a sense of fatigue, poor employment opportunities with little let-up in migration from the state, and public frustration of those who want the state to have more than basic necessities pose a big challenge to him, what helps him is that the opposition's chief ministerial face Tejashwi continues to be weighed down with the legacy of his father.BJP's support is a big help as it ensures support of vocal upper castes and non-Yadav OBCs and EBCs among whom the saffron party has steadily made inroads. PM Narendra Modi has been warning voters in his rallies and virtual interactions against the return of 'jungle raj' of RJD, while offering wholehearted endorsement of Nitish.Lalu had famously said he might not have given people 'swarg' (heaven) but did render them 'swar' (voice), a suggestion that RJD govt empowered socially-deprived classes even though it scored poorly on governance. Nitish is seen to have succeeded in broadening the empowerment tent by pivoting govt's welfare focus to EBCs and most-deprived of Scheduled Castes, and provided an efficient administration as well. Focus on governance, building of infrastructure and a push for welfare schemes and empowerment initiatives like quotas for women and EBCs seem to be cushioning against attempts to turn his long tenure into a vulnerability.To his admirers, Nitish is also a rare politician who, despite his two decades in office, has managed to avoid any taint of corruption or charge of subversion of due process for rewarding his band of loyalists with govt jobs or contracts, an attribute brought into sharp relief when compared to a host of netas heading regional parties, not the least his arch rival Lalu.Despite lacking the advantage of an assured vote bank like Lalu, whose caste Yadavs account for over 14.2% of population, Nitish has assiduously weaved a support block comprising of sections of non-Yadav OBCs, EBCs and Scheduled Castes.In his multiple stints in office since 2005, the 74-year-old neta has cultivated women voters with a host of sops, from 35% quota in govt jobs to 50% quota in local bodies. The recent transfer of Rs 10,000 to over 1.20 crore of them being the latest outreach. His choice of keeping family members out of politics also casts him in a positive light for his supporters when no major regional party leadership can escape the charge of nepotism.",Nitish kumar was seen as nda's weak link in the run up to bihar assembly poll announcement. His party's strength has declined in the assembly over successive elections.

SRINAGAR: J&K CM Omar Abdullah 's National Conference and BJP teamed up in the assembly for the first time Tuesday to vote out PDP 's proposed ""anti-bulldozer bill"" that seeks to grant ownership rights to locals occupying illegal properties on state-owned land for over 20 years.Omar, already facing allegations about last Friday's Rajya Sabha election being ""a fixed match"" after BJP won one of the four seats at stake, received a rare shout-out from the saffron party later for rejecting PDP's land bill ""in national interest"".""How can this bill be justified when it seeks to legitimise illegal constructions on state land?"" Omar said in the House before speaker Abdul Rahim Rather put the bill to vote. ""If it is passed, it would mean that anyone who builds a house on state land tomorrow can claim it as their own. That is simply unacceptable,"" he added.The rebuff came less than a week after PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti declared at a presser that her party had agreed to support NC in the Rajya Sabha election on the condition that the governing party would back its J&K (Regularisation and Recognition of Property Rights of Residents in Public Land) Bill.""BJP's threat to block the passage of PDP's land regularisation (anti-bulldozer) bill, which they branded the 'land jihad bill', was fulfilled today,"" Mehbooba wrote on X after the move was voted out. ""The chief minister, who had earlier assured that any pro-people initiative from PDP would face no obstacles under his leadership, has once again reneged on his word. This marks yet another U-turn added to his growing list of unfulfilled guarantees and promises. ""The draft of the rejected bill defines ""residents"" as those holding permanent resident certificates, which were replaced with domicile certificates after the abrogation of Article 370. PDP projects the bill as one meant to safeguard the rights of J&K residents who are being slapped with eviction notices.CM Omar harked back to the defunct Roshni Act being challenged in court and defeated despite what he said was a well-intentioned move to ""provide relief to people who had acquired legal rights over land"".""Here, this bill is justifying illegal encroachment,"" he said, urging PDP member Waheed Parra to withdraw it immediately.Parra refused to do so, accusing Omar of siding with BJP and against the interest of those living in J&K. ""BJP calls this bill 'land jihad', and now you are backing away from it? You should debate the bill; if there are any loopholes, we can fix them,"" he said.When the PDP legislator told Omar that ""even your relatives have suffered on account of this"", alluding to the controversy surrounding Hotel Nedous in Gulmarg, the CM stood up to clarify that his kin had ""a rightful lease over the land"".""But I will not bring a bill to protect my relatives"" Omar said. ""You are bringing religion and politics into this. You should not compare land for the landless with this bill.""BJP MLA Sunil Sharma applauded and thanked the CM for taking what he said was a decisive step against ""a notorious bill"" to regularise encroachment. ""Alongside terrorism, large-scale encroachment took place with the support of previous govts in J&K,"" he said.Parra told reporters outside the assembly later that his party was only voicing ""concerns about land ownership and demographic changes since the abrogation of Article 370"".","J&k cm omar abdullah's national conference and bjp teamed up in the assembly for the first time tuesday to vote out pdp's proposed ""anti-bulldozer bill"" the bill seeks to grant ownership rights to locals occupying illegal properties on state-owned land for over 20 years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124880951,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-192636,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

‘Bihar Got Not Even 1% of Gujarat’s Share’: Tejashwi Yadav Explodes at PM Modi

PATNA: INDIA bloc CM face Tejashwi Yadav 's projection as ""jannayak (people's leader)"" and ""nayak (hero)"" has been contested not only by BJP but also by a senior within his own RJD , with its national general secretary Abdul Bari Siddiqui taking exception to such labels.Siddiqui said it would take Tejashwi time and hard work to get the title of Jannayak, which is exclusively used for former Bihar CM and Bharat Ratna Karpoori Thakur. ""Tejashwi is engaged in politics based on his father and RJD chief Lalu Prasad's legacy. He is the virasat (legacy) of Lalu Prasad's politics and may get this honour after establishing himself by following the footsteps of his father and Thakur,"" Siddiqui added.While RJD posters with Tejashwi's photograph, captioned ""Bihar ka Nayak"" have come up ahead of next month's assembly elections, he as well as Congress Lok Sabha opposition leader Rahul Gandhi were first called jannayak during ""Voter Adhikar Yatra"" in the state over a month ago against the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls. The row seems to have intensified after Congress put up social media posts on Monday with videos and photos of Rahul, describing him as jannayak.Tejashwi's estranged elder brother Tej Pratap also disapproved of such titles. ""Calling yourself jannayak doesn't make you a people's leader. Karpoori Thakur, Ram Manohar Lohia, Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi were the real jannayaks. Rahul and Tejashwi are under the ""chatrachaya (protection and patronage) of Lalu Prasad. If that protection is removed, they will be nothing,"" Tej Pratap said.BJP's Shehzad Poonawalla seized on Siddiqui's statement to claim that neither the public nor his own colleagues had confidence in Tejaswhi. ""Despite contesting elections for years, he has failed to earn people's trust. Even within his circle, from RJD's Abdul Bari Siddiqui to SP MLA Ravidas Mehrotra, besides his brother Tej Pratap, no one sees him as a true leader,"" he said.Another BJP spokesperson, Ajay Alok, took the title tiff further, saying Tejashwi ""is not a nayak but nalayak"".","Tejashwi yadav's projection as ""jannayak (people's leader)"" has been contested by bjp and a senior within his own rjd.

HYDERABAD: In yet another blow to CPI (Maoist), two of its prominent figures - central committee member Pulluri Prasad Rao alias Chandranna and Telangana state committee member Bandi Prakash alias Prabhath - surrendered before DGP B Shivadhar Reddy in Hyderabad on Tuesday.The surrender, carried out without arms or much fanfare, marks the exit of two senior members long seen as key strategists within the Maoist brass. The duo cited deteriorating health, deepening ideological divisions, and sustained pressure from security forces as reasons for dissociating from the armed movement.""This is in response to CM A Revanth Reddy's call to join the mainstream,"" said Reddy. ""Both Chandranna and Prabhath decided to distance themselves from the organisation due to internal rift, chronic ailments and divergence within the Maoist leadership.

He said the party was divided into two factions, and the underground cadres and members were choosing their own paths.""I want to make it clear this is not a surrender...

When Love Turns Lethal: Inside India’s Honeymoon Murders | The Silent Crisis No One Talks About

Crime shows to crime scene



A clue in the burn pattern



Revenge and confession



NEW DELHI: It was meant to be ""perfect murder"" -- until it wasn't. A 21-year-old forensic science student's elaborate plan to kill her 32-year-old live-in partner and disguise it as an accident fell apart after CCTV footage and expert analysis exposed her crime.Amrita Chauhan, along with her ex-boyfriend Sumit Kashyap (27) and their friend Sandeep Kumar (29), strangled UPSC aspirant Ramkesh Meena to death this month. The trio then poured oil, ghee, and wine on his body to ensure it burned completely, police said.Meena had allegedly refused to delete Amrita's private photos and videos stored on his hard disk, the dispute which turned fatal for him.According to police, Amrita, a forensic science student, used her academic knowledge and ideas inspired by crime web series to stage the murder as an accidental fire. “The case was one of the perfectly planned murders, but it was solved even more perfectly by the Delhi Police through relentless investigation and scientific analysis,” said Special Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Ravindra Yadav told PTI news agency.Investigators said Amrita was obsessed with crime web series and binge-watched them regularly, using what she learned to plot the murder. Initially, the crime scene -- a north Delhi Gandhi Vihar flat -- appeared to show a cylinder blast, with no visible signs of violence.Yadav said, “At the onset, it appeared to be an accidental fire. But no matter how perfect a plan is, criminals always leave some clue. Our team worked more perfectly and cracked the case.”Police said Amrita used her forensic training to erase evidence, pouring oil, ghee, and wine on the body and leaving the cylinder valve open before igniting it. “Amrita, being a forensic student, had used her knowledge to erase evidence,” Yadav added.However, forensic experts soon noticed irregularities in the burn marks that didn’t match an accidental fire. This led investigators to re-examine the case.“We scanned several CCTV cameras around the area and found two masked men entering the building on the night of October 5, followed by Amrita and another man later. Moments after they left, the fire erupted,” Yadav said.The CCTV footage shifted the course of the probe. Combined with call data records and technical surveillance, it placed Amrita near the scene when the fire broke out. Police tracked her movements and arrested her from Moradabad on October 18.During interrogation, Amrita broke down and confessed. She told police that Meena had recorded intimate videos of her and refused to delete them after their breakup. Furious, she sought help from her ex-boyfriend Sumit, who, along with Sandeep, helped her plan and execute the murder.Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) Raja Banthia said, “The hard disk has been sent for forensic examination. Further investigation into the matter is under way.”On the night of October 5–6, the trio went to Meena’s flat. Sumit and Sandeep strangled him, while Amrita poured oil, ghee, and wine on his body. Sumit, an LPG distributor, opened the cylinder knob near Meena’s head before setting it on fire. They locked the flat from inside using Amrita’s hand through a removed portion of the iron gate net and escaped with Meena’s hard disk, laptops, and other belongings. An hour later, the cylinder exploded, engulfing the body in flames.“We have substantial evidence to prove the crime -- from CCTV footage to recovered items and digital traces,” Yadav said.Following her arrest, police recovered Meena’s hard disk, a trolley bag, and a shirt belonging to the victim. Sumit was later caught from Moradabad on October 21, and Sandeep was nabbed two days after. Their phones and other evidence used in the crime were also seized.What was meant to be a “perfect murder” planned by a forensic mind turned into a perfect case solved by forensic science itself.","Amrita chauhan, 21, strangled her 32-year-old live-in partner ramkesh meena to death.

""And what do they hope to gain by promising Mukesh Sahni the Deputy CM's post?
