AHMEDABAD: Aspirations to walk tall and proud in khaki have ""shrunk"" after running into a tape measure.Several police job hopefuls in Gujarat have moved the high court after failing to rise to one's full height in the latest recruitment drive, falling below the mandatory 165cm (5.4ft) cut-off despite, reportedly, having earlier cleared the same benchmark.Confusion surfaced during the physical efficiency test, where candidates who had been measured at or above 165cm during a recruitment drive in 2024 were declared ineligible. Authorities, recently, said aspirants now fall short of the record.Among the petitioners: Tushar Bhaliya and Govind Sindhav of Gandhinagar, Pappu Parmar of Banaskantha, and Mukesh Chauhan of Ahmedabad. All had reapplied for different police posts and were previously cleared on height. This time, they got the short end of the stick.As petitions piled up before HC, Justice Nirzar Mehta added a filter: each petitioner must deposit Rs 10,000 with court registry, refundable if claim were correct.To settle the inches-versus-centimetres debate, HC ordered for a fresh measurement to be conducted under strict medical supervision.Candidates must appear Feb 19 at GMERS civil hospital in Sola, carrying proof of deposit. Concerned Hospital authorities have been directed to arrange the process and facilitate it.Transparency is non-negotiable in the process. The bench said ""the entire exercise be videographed and a report be produced before this court on the returnable date"" of Feb 23.","Aspirations to walk tall and proud in khaki have ""shrunk"" after running into a tape measure.

NEW DELHI: Muhammad Yunus 's reference to the northeastern states without recognising them as a part of India in his farewell address as the chief adviser of Bangladesh's interim govt drew a sharp takedown from BJP functionary Mahesh Jethmalani who said he has presided over a country that looks increasingly ""unmoored"".""Bangladesh deserves serious statecraft. Instead, it has got a headline-chasing interim figure who treats India as a prop. The Soros-lackey chameleon called Md Yunus,"" the senior advocate said, who slammed his telivised address to the nation on Monday as another gratuitous sermon on India.The swearing-in of BNP chairman Tarique Rahman as Bangladesh's PM on Tuesday marked the end of the Yunus-headed interim govt, which took charge following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina govt after violent protests in 2024.""The headline-chasing head sprinkled his televised address with the familiar sovereignty/dignity theatrics and a sly reference to India's north-east and seven sisters of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura - without calling them part of India,"" Jethmalani said. ""When you can't govern, you grandstand. When you can't stabilise your own country, you try to manufacture an external villain - preferably the neighbour that actually functions.Yunus, he said, wasn't elected and instead instigated a volatile interim perch and has since presided over a Bangladesh that looks increasingly unmoored. He speaks as if he is Bangladesh's permanent conscience and the irony is almost comic, Jethmalani said.""All he will be remembered for is a hubris that is beyond redemption whose ideological shape-shifting is the tell.

How do the fares of Vande Bharat chair car trains compare to similar trains around the world? According to Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, the ticket prices for the Vande Bharat chair car are much lower than such trains operating in countries such France, China, and Japan.Vande Bharat chair car is an all air-conditioned service that was first introduced in 2019 and has since then expanded across the Indian Railways network. The self-propelled train set is said to be a world-class offering by the national transporter, allowing for better passenger amenities and faster train travel.Recently, Ashwini Vaishnaw informed the Lok Sabha that the fare for the Vande Bharat AC chair car for journeys covering around 300 to 400 kilometres is approximately Rs 2.19 per kilometre. This, he said, is significantly lower than comparable services in countries such as China, Japan and France.“The fare of Vande Bharat AC chair car over a journey between 300 and 400 kilometres is around Rs 2.19 per kilometre, which is much lower than the fares of similar segments of services in countries like China, Japan and France, where it ranges from Rs 7 to Rs 20 per kilometre,” Vaishnaw said.Also Read | How seven new high-speed rail corridors can transform train travel in India In his written reply, Vaishnaw said the Ministry of Railways determines passenger fares after considering multiple factors, including operational costs, the value and quality of services provided, the nature of facilities offered, affordability for passengers, competition from alternative modes of transport, and broader socio-economic considerations.Vande Bharat train services currently operate across 82 routes, running a total of 164 services. According to the minister, these trains function as a separate category within passenger services, featuring a different fare structure along with amenities such as improved suspension systems, quicker acceleration through semi-high-speed operations, automatic plug doors, ergonomic seating, mini pantry facilities, CCTV surveillance and the KAVACH safety system.Vaishnaw added that passenger affordability has remained a key consideration, and as a result, ticket prices for these trains have been maintained below the actual cost of providing the service.He further said, “The rationalised fare structure has facilitated the wider expansion of these services across the country, reflecting strong passenger demand for these services. Vande Bharat services have high occupancy level on all major routes with occupancy of Vande Bharat near 100 per cent, demonstrating a change in passenger preferences.”Commenting on fares in the ordinary class of other trains, Vaishnaw said these remain among the lowest when compared internationally.Drawing a comparison with neighbouring countries, he noted that the per-kilometre fare in India stands at about 20 paise, while the corresponding fares are 54 paise in Pakistan, 37 paise in Bangladesh and 51 paise in Sri Lanka.Recently a sleeper version of the Vande Bharat Express train has also been launched, and hundreds of such trains are planned for overnight train travel in the coming years.",Vande bharat chair car is an all air-conditioned service that was first introduced in 2019.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that groping a female and untying her pyjama string constituted ""attempt to rape"" and set aside Allahabad HC's controversial judgment terming the offence not an ""attempt"" but ""preparation to commit rape"", which attracts less punishment, being categorised as outraging the modesty of a woman.The HC's March 17, 2025, judgment had created a furo-re and SC took suo motu cognisance of the case after a letter from NGO 'We the Women' through founder president and senior advocate Shobha Gupta.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and N V Anjaria set aside the HC judgment and revived the original stringent charge of attempt to rape against the two persons under Pocso Act.Referring to pleas by Gupta and senior advocate H S Phoolka for greater sensitivity in judges while dealing with sexual offences against women, the bench said, ""No judge or judgment of any court can be expected to do complete justice when it is inconsiderate towards the factual realities of a litigant and the vulnerabilities which they may be facing in approaching a court of law.""Writing the judgment, CJI Kant said the efforts of judges ""must not only be grounded in the sound application of constitutional and legal principles but also foster an environment of compassion and empathy. The absence of eit-her of these cornerstones wo-uld prevent judicial institutions from properly performing their critical duties.""The bench said, ""Our decisions as participants in the legal process, from laying down the procedure that shall have to be faced by common citizens to the final judgment passed in any given case, must reflect the ethos of compassion, humanity and understanding, which are essential for creating a fair and effective justice system.""SC said it had laid down principles to sensitise judges and so would refrain from taking an open-ended approach to devise fresh guidelines without guidance. It requested National Judicial Academy director Justice Aniruddha Bose to constitute a committee of experts to prepare a ""comprehensive report"" on 'Developing Guidelines to Inculcate Sensitivity and Compassion into Judges and Judicial Processes in the Context of Sexual Offences and other Vulnerable Cases'.""The guidelines, we expect, will not be loaded with heavy, complicated expressions borne from foreign languages and jurisdictions,"" said the CJI-led bench, which had termed then CJI D Y Cha-ndrachud's 'Handbook on Co-mbating gender Stereotypes' too ""Harvard-oriented"".","Supreme court rules that groping a female and untying her pyjama string constituted ""attempt to rape"" court sets aside allahabad hc's controversial judgment terming offence not an 'attempt' but ""preparation to commit rape"", which attracts less punishment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128484198,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-171096,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday sharply criticised Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi over their opposition to the Great Nicobar island infrastructure project, accusing them of going to great lengths to derail it. The governing party cited the National Green Tribunal's nod to the initiative as a triumph of truth that foiled their disruptive attempts.Coal and mines minister G Kishan Reddy alleged, ""On directions from international collaborators, the mother-son duo of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have been going to great lengths to derail the Great Nicobar mega infrastructure project worth approximately Rs 80,000 crore.""India currently relies heavily on foreign ports for transshipment, he said, adding that the project aims to construct an international transshipment terminal, an international airport, a power plant and a township, leveraging its proximity to the Malacca Strait.""With this, another attempt by the Gandhis has failed,"" he said, referring to their opposition over alleged environmental damage.Sonia Gandhi, in a newspaper article last year, had called the project the making of ""an ecological disaster"" and a ""grave misadventure"" trampling tribal rights and legal processes.Echoing her, Rahul Gandhi said it underscores ""injustices inflicted on Nicobar's people and its delicate ecosystem"".The central govt has rejected the criticism, asserting the project will not harm or displace indigenous tribes and will help counter China's expansionist designs. Reddy said the proposed hub would cater to East-West cargo routes, emphasising the NGT's acknowledgement of safeguards.""As PM Narendra Modi dedicates his life to building a strong atmanirbhar and Viksit Bharat, many have tried to obstruct India's development journey.

NAGPUR: Maharashtra Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) Sunday raided 21 locations across multiple districts and busted an alleged radicalisation network operating under the garb of a soccer club. At the centre was a Nagpur-based grocer who allegedly used a club in Yavatmal's Pusad as a front to indoctrinate youth into 'jihadi' ideology.Preliminary findings indicated many suspects - projected as footballers - maintained contact with cross-border radical Islamic terror outfits. Intelligence sources said they were involved in online discussions promoting anti-India sentiments and pro-jihadi views. The grocer allegedly sent them, disguised as a football team, to radicalisation workshops in Kerala and West Bengal. Expensive flight tickets point to a well-organised, financially backed network aimed at grooming vulnerable youths through targeted meetings.

Former Assam Congress Chief Bhupen Borah to Join BJP, Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma Confirms

Borah’s 24-hour of U-turns

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Tuesday announced that former state Congress chief Bhupen Borah will join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on February 22. The announcement comes as Sarma met Borah at his residence in Guwahati today evening.Addressing reporters, Sarma said, “Bhupen Borah will join BJP on 22nd February. Dilip Saikia will work out the details. Along with him, a good number of Congress leaders will join the BJP in Guwahati and North Lakhimpur.”He described Borah as “the last recognised Hindu leader in Congress” and said that the BJP’s national leadership had already cleared his induction. “Our National President Nitin Nabin has already approved his joining and welcomes him. Bhupen Borah will be accorded all due respect and dignity,” Sarma said.Calling the move a “homecoming”, the chief minister added, “Joining the BJP will be like a homecoming for him because it is a party with many people like him, whose fathers did not occupy any high offices.”""Bhupen Borah's joining will completely create an image, which is a reality too, that Congress is no longer a party of mainstream Assamese people,"" Sarma added.Hitting out at the Congress leadership, state CM questioned the party’s internal functioning and accused it of favouring selected leaders over grassroots workers.He said, “If you go to Majuli, and take one particular leader in the Yatra, then that means you don't want Congress to win. A genuine Congress leader will feel pain that this party is not fighting to win elections. I have gone through the same pain. When I went to join the BJP, even I got those calls. These people live like a feudal lord. They think they will make one call and the decision will be changed... If someone says I have gone to Islamabad to see Park Hotel, and you give approval to those people, then aren't you anti-national?”Borah had exited the Congress on Monday morning, saying that he had sent his resignation letter to the high command at 8 am after feeling “ignored” within the state unit.“I sent my resignation to the Congress High Command at 8 am this morning and explained in detail why I was compelled to take this stand. This is not a personal decision. I have given 32 years to the party and joined it in 1994,” Borah told reporters.“This principle is not merely personal; it is driven by concern for the party's future. That is why I conveyed everything in detail to the Congress High Command,” he added.A two-time legislator who headed the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee from 2021 to 2025 before being replaced by Gaurav Gogoi, Borah maintained that his decision was not meant to signal retirement from politics.“There has been no formal proposal from any political party, but it is a fact that I have not taken the decision to resign to bid farewell to politics,” he said.However, within hours of political speculation intensifying and amid an open invitation from Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma to join the Bharatiya Janata Party, Borah entered into discussions with senior Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi.Congress’s Assam in-charge Bhanwar Jitendra Singh later announced that the resignation had been withdrawn after dialogue.“I thank Bhupen Borah for taking back his resignation. Senior Congress leader Bhupen Borah is an important member of the Congress family. He had sent his resignation to our party's national president,” Singh said.“Sometimes differences of opinion arise, but these have been resolved through discussions,” he added, reaffirming Borah’s importance to the organisation.Sarma had earlier invited Borah to join the BJP shortly after the latter submitted his resignation from the Congress, triggering political upheaval in the poll-bound state. He had said the BJP’s doors were open and even promised to help Borah secure a “safe seat” if he decided to switch sides.Drawing parallels with his own political journey, Sarma had said Borah’s resignation reflected deeper issues within the Congress. “His resignation carries the symbolic message that in the Congress, no one from a normal family can prosper. Congress does not give recognition to people from ordinary families, but I hail from an ordinary middle-class family and the BJP has made me a chief minister. We stay opposite to the politics of blue blood,” he said.The episode comes at a crucial time, with elections to the 126-member Assam Assembly expected in March–April. The ruling BJP currently holds 64 seats, while its allies Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) and Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) together add to its strength. The Congress has 26 MLAs in the House and is preparing to contest the polls in alliance with other opposition parties.","Former state congress chief bhupen borah will join the bharatiya janata party (bjp) on february 22.

JAMMU: J&K CM Omar Abdullah voiced a mix of hope and scepticism Tuesday after Union law minister Arjun Meghwal said a decision on restoring statehood to the Union territory would be announced “soon”, citing an assurance by home minister Amit Shah in Parliament.“One-and-a-half years have passed since an elected govt assumed office and we are still waiting,” Omar told reporters. “We hope we will not have to wait much longer.”Speaking after a function at Srinagar’s Sher-i-Kashmir International Conference Centre, Meghwal described statehood as “an important” and “very sensitive” question. “When the Union home minister has said in Parliament that you will get this right, then you will get it,” he said, adding that a process was underway.Omar said patience was wearing thin. “We will not be satisfied till we get it. The process is underway but it is taking far too long,” he said, adding that his govt remained in continuous engagement with Centre.The push comes nearly six years after Centre abrogated Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019, and split the former state into two UTs — J&K and Ladakh. On Dec 11, 2023, Supreme Court upheld the move while urging that J&K’s statehood be restored “as soon as possible”.Omar, who took office on Oct 16, 2024, has repeatedly raised the issue.

Multiple aspects of plane crash raise apprehensions, says NCP

MUMBAI: Deputy CM Sunetra Pawar and other NCP members on Tuesday met CM Devendra Fadnavis and demanded a CBI probe into the Jan 28 air crash that killed Ajit Pawar NCP state chief Sunil Tatkare told reporters that the CM has assured them the state govt would communicate with the Union home ministry. ""The govt has already initiated a probe by independent agencies and has said it will order a CBI investigation. We feel a probe by the central agency would be comprehensive,"" Tatkare said. Sunetra Pawar, accompanied by her elder son Parth Pawar and others, handed over to the CM a letter seeking a CBI probe.Ajit Pawar and four others were killed in a crash in Baramati.In the letter, NCP stated, ""Multiple aspects surrounding the incident give rise to legitimate apprehensions requiring investigation by an independent central agency.""Among the ""substantial questions"" raised, the letter said, were the reported last-minute changes in flight crew composition which requires scrutiny of operational decision-making and authorisation, apparent anomalies concerning Air Traffic Control communications and sequencing of runway clearances, concerns regarding the functioning and integrity of critical onboard safety warning systems, absence of any recorded distress communication despite proximity to landing phase, and matters requiring forensic evaluation, including crew fitness, maintenance compliance, and aircraft systems.The party said that as the probe into the incident involves highly technical aviation, forensic, electronic, and operational considerations, the investigative powers, technical expertise, and inter-state jurisdictional capacity of CBI render it the most appropriate agency to conduct a comprehensive inquiry.A CBI probe would serve to reinforce confidence in the fairness and integrity of the investigative process and ensure that all aspects are examined without limitation, the letter stated.NCP highlighted that the nature of the incident transcends an ordinary accident and directly engages public confidence in aviation safety, regulatory oversight, and institutional accountability.The NCP legislature party is fully behind Sunetra Pawar and there is no dissent, Tatkare said.He said BJP state chief Ravindra Chavan met him at the NCP office and discussed the way forward for the Mahayuti alliance after its victory in the zilla parishad polls. He also said incidents such as bribery in NCP minister Narhari Zirwal's office malign the image of govt and ministers.","Ncp demans cbi probe into ajit pawar's death, submits memorandum to fadnavis.

At Kota academy, twins turned every test into a private contest

MUMBAI/JAIPUR: In a city crowded with toppers and tight schedules, brothers Mahroof Ahmed Khan and Masroor Ahmed Khan in Kota stand out for an almost uncanny symmetry. The twins, who share the same shoe size and eyeglass power, studied together, tested together, sat the same JEE Main (Session-I) 2026 shift, and walked away with identical marks till the last digit - 285 out of 300; an NTA score of 99.998.Under NTA rules, candidates must declare if they are twins while filling out forms for the same competitive exam. Such candidates are made to take the exam in the same shift to ensure the integrity of exams like JEE and NEET. Their story began in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, and moved, like so many other JEE journeys, to Kota in 2023.Known for cracking Olympiad exams, the twin brothers hoped the city's coaching ecosystem would sharpen them for bigger tests ahead, and turned friendly rivalry into a full-time study tool.""The twins came here sharing not just classrooms and notes, but an entire rhythm of preparation. Born on May 7, 2008, they have moved in parallel lines for as long as they can remember - same school, same coaching, same ambition,"" said Prof Amit Ahuja, career counsellor at Allen Career Institute. Behind this effort was a decision that reshaped the family's life.Their mother, Dr Zeenat Begum, a gynaecologist who had been working for Odisha govt since the 1990s, put her career on hold to move to Kota with her sons.For three years, she managed their routines, meals, health, and morale, becoming the quiet constant in a high-pressure environment.Zeenat said the move to Kota was initially meant to be temporary. ""Both of them got selected for the International Science Olympiad in 2023, and we came to Kota in March that year, thinking we would stay for a few months till they prepared for the Olympiad exam. But after a few weeks, both said that they liked the environment and the study approach here and decided to pursue coaching for JEE,"" she said. ""When they decided to pursue a career in engineering and prepare in Kota for JEE, I left my job as I thought that if their career was made, I too could restart mine. But supporting them is important in this phase,"" Zeenat said.At the academy, the twins found their competitive edge not in outpacing others, but in pushing each other. If one slipped, the other stepped in - dissecting mistakes, revising concepts, and resetting goals.At home, the competition stayed strictly in-house. Their mother said the twins competed only as a preparation strategy, calling each other their ""friend"" and ""mirror"". ""They would study and give exams together and compare their scores with each other and with their previous attempts. It helped them identify their weaknesses, and they worked to improve them. This mutual competition is their greatest strength,"" said Zeenat.","Mahroof ahmed khan and masroor ahmed khan sat the same jee main (session-i) 2026 shift.

At 49.1 lakh, Ahmedabad district has most voters in Gujarat

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat's electoral strength contracted 13.4% to 4.4 crore voters on completion of a special intensive revision (SIR) that saw 77 lakh-odd names being deleted from the 2025 rolls and 9.5 lakh new electors getting added to the final list published Tuesday.The double-digit percentage decline caps two rounds of scrutiny, starting with 73.7 lakh deletions when the draft rolls were published last Dec after updating mortality records, migration data and incorrect registrations. Another 3.9 lakh names were removed before the final rolls were put out. Between the publication of the draft and final rolls, the electorate expanded 1.3%, a large section of them first-time voters.Around 40 lakh voters in the unrevised 2025 rolls were found to have permanently shifted, 18 lakh were dead, 9.8 lakh couldn't be traced to their registered addresses, and 3.8 lakh had duplicate voter cards.Another 1.9 lakh voters' names in Gujarat were omitted for other reasons. Based on objections and further verification after the draft rolls were published, another 3.9 lakh names were deleted from the rolls.Ahmedabad topped the state with 49.1 lakh voters in the final rolls, up from 48 lakh in the draft list. The district also recorded the highest number of additions at 1.5 lakh new electors. In percentage terms, Dang registered the highest proportional increase at 2.15%, although its total voter base stands at 1.9 lakh. Other districts with notable percentage growth were Porbandar (2.1%), Jamnagar (2%), Botad (1.9%), Chhota Udepur (1.9%) and Gandhinagar (1.8%).Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot reported substantial additions, reflecting migration patterns and youth enrolment.

Hate speech PIL 'targets' BJP CMs: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hate-speech-pil-targets-bjp-cms-supreme-court/articleshow/128485381.cms,"Representational image

NEW DELHI: SC on Tuesday criticised 12 'eminent' persons who together filed a PIL ""targeting"" CMs of BJP-governed states for alleged hate speeches while making a plea for framing guidelines to restrain constitutional functionaries and bureaucrats from breaching fidelity to constitutional morality.Appearing for petitioners, senior advocate Kapil Sibal told a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices BV Nagarathna and Joymalya Bagchi that the country's atmosphere had become toxic and ""it is only the SC which can and should remedy it.""However, the CJI-led bench was quick to point out that the petition had selectively named individuals while highlighting the problem. ""This petition is definitely targeting certain individuals as it leaves out others who routinely make such hate speeches. Let the petitioners not create an impression that it is targeting certain individuals.""The petitioners, including Roop Rekha Verma, Mohd Adeep, Harsh Mander, Najeeb Jung, John Dayal and Ashok Kumar Sharma had cited the alleged hate speeches of Himanta Biswa Sarma, Yogi Adityanath, Devendra Fadnavis, Pushkar Singh Dhami, Anantkumar Hegde and Giriraj Singh, all of whom belong to BJP, in addition to certain remarks by some bureaucrats.""Come with an impartial and neutral petition. The issue is important. Ultimately, there must be restraint in speech from all sides. We would like to say all political party functionaries must be mindful of constitutional morality and exercise restraint in their speeches, and any guideline should be applicable across the board,"" said the CJI.The bench said there are political parties which brazenly make speeches based on their communal ideology and openly profess hatred. ""You have not cited a single example from the other side.""When Sibal said he would delete all references to individuals in the petition, the bench responded that it would hear the PIL after the necessary amendments are carried out.Justice Nagarathna said, ""Political party leaders must foster fraternity. Courts can pass orders. But the remedy lies in political parties and democratic institutions living up to constitutional values and morality."" Justice Nagarathna added, ""The origin of speech is the thought process. Can by court order the thought process of a person be altered or restricted? What about free speech?""Justice Bagchi told Sibal, ""It is such a vague petition. Instead of it being a populist exercise, let it be a constructive constitutional exercise. Humdrum of politics should not dictate the filing of the PIL.""Sibal sought two weeks to amend the PIL.The two prayers of the petitioners read like fundamental duties of a citizen: a) declaration that public speeches of constitutional functionaries or holders of public office are subject to constitutional morality and should not violate fundamental rights of others; b) formulation of guidelines to govern public speech by constitutional functionaries and bureaucrats to ensure fidelity to constitutional morality, without imposing prior restraint or censorship.","12 'eminent' persons together filed a pil ""targeting"" cms of bjp-governed states for alleged hate speeches.

PATNA: The justice clock at Patna district courts ticked towards a rare moment on Monday when special judge Avinash Kumar of the CBI court delivered the verdict in a 15-year-old bank fraud case not inside a courtroom, but on the roadside.The extraordinary hearing took place outside the court premises as the accused, Jai Narayan Singh, a frail 95-year-old man, lay inside a vehicle, barely able to move his legs. At the fag end of his life, he admitted his guilt and pleaded for amnesty.The judge held Jai Narayan guilty, and disposed of the case after imposing a fine of Rs 2,000 on him. He was spared a prison sentence because of his advanced age and debilitating condition.The special court also took notice of the fact that Jai Narayan had already refunded to UCO Bank the entire loan amount - approximately Rs 4 lakh - which he had fraudulently obtained 15 years ago for the purchase of a tractor on the basis of forged documents.CBI had registered the case in 2011 against fake borrowers and other accused persons, including employees of UCO Bank, who allegedly swindled public money under the garb of agricultural loan schemes in Jamui district of Bihar.The judge heard the matter for nearly 35 minutes on the road leading to Patna civil courts.","Jai narayan singh, a frail 95-year-old man, lay inside a vehicle, barely able to move his legs.
