Cash-strapped Congress to revive crowdfunding at district level,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cash-strapped-congress-to-revive-crowdfunding-at-district-level/articleshow/121558876.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Just over a year after Income Tax notices forced it to discontinue its newly launched ""crowdfunding"" platform for resource mobilisation, Congress is set to reintroduce the novel programme with a nationwide focus down to the district level, which would complement its move to empower the organisation's bottom rung.Congress has finalised a revamped crowdfunding plan where donations would be invited at the district level. A page dedicated to every district will be opened on the official party website, and each resident can pick his district to contribute to the Congress kitty.It will be different from the ""donate for desh"" launched in December 2023 ahead of the 2024 parliamentary elections.After it was launched on December 18, 2023, the initiative created a splash as a first of its kind in the political sphere, and made bigger news as the principal opposition party's bid to overcome the funding skew created by the later-scrapped electoral bonds scheme that was viewed to favour the governing party. Congress got Rs 25 crore in one and half months, through 3 lakh donors. But the donation platform had to be paused abruptly in view of the IT notices to Congress, that saw the department take massive ""liens"" on its accounts, which threatened to funnel the money generated through crowdfunding into the govt kitty.Congress treasurer Ajay Maken recently gave a plan to district presidents on how the party proposes to generate funds at district level which can be used by local units for their functioning and programmes.According to the plan, the money generated in a district will be turned into a corpus fund, and Congress will provide a matching amount, and interest generated on the money will help finance organisational activities. Sources, however, said donations will be to AICC account only, as it alone is legally entitled to accept donations.This is in sync with the big Congress decision to empower the district units to bolster its grassroots strength amid dwindling political fortunes in the face of BJP’s continued dominance for a decade. As decided at the Ahmedabad AICC session in April, Congress has pledged to turn the district Congress units into the hubs of its organizational work, and also plans to vest real decision-making powers in them.According to strategists, crowdfunding helps in more ways than monetary. The small donors feel a stake in the party which increases their political commitment. Besides, the donations will be updated on the website in real time and also ready the workers’ database automatically.Under the Representation of People’s Act, money up to Rs 20,000 does not require a donor to present his PAN Card and only money above that sum is required to be disclosed to the Election Commission annually.","Congress has finalised a revamped crowdfunding plan where donations would be invited at the district level.

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Police defended the arrest of Instagram influencer Sharmistha Panoli, saying that legal action was taken not for her political views but for allegedly sharing a video that insulted religious beliefs and promoted communal disharmony.In a detailed statement posted on X, Kolkata Police dismissed claims circulating online that Panoli was targeted for expressing nationalist sentiments. “Some social media accounts are spreading false information that Kolkata Police has unlawfully arrested a law student for opposing Pakistan. This narrative is mischievous and misleading,” the statement read.The case against Panoli was registered on 15 May at Garden Reach Police Station. According to the police, the video in question was considered “insulting to the religious belief of a class of citizen of India and amounted to promoting disharmony and hatred between different communities.” The police said they had acted under relevant sections of the newly implemented Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).Repeated attempts to serve legal notice to Panoli reportedly failed, with the police saying she was “absconding.”“Several attempts were made to serve notice u/s 35 of BNSS to the accused but every time she was found absconding,” Kolkata Police said. A court then issued a warrant for her arrest. She was apprehended from Gurugram, Haryana, during daytime hours and later presented before a magistrate, who granted transit remand. She was eventually sent to judicial custody.“Hate speech targeting any religious figure or community or any class of citizens of India which has potential to incite disharmony and hatred between different communities is a punishable offence... Hate speech & abusive language should not be misconstrued as freedom of speech & expression as enshrined in Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution,” the police said.Panoli, a 22-year-old law student from Pune, had deleted the video and issued a public apology on May 15. Her arrest on Friday night triggered political controversy and public debate. Actress and BJP MP Kangana Ranaut called the move excessive and said, “She should be released soon because she is a very young woman. She has her whole career and life ahead of her.”BJP’s Amit Malviya also criticised the arrest, accusing the state government of “appeasement politics” and questioned why no action was taken against chief minister Mamata Banerjee for her own allegedly divisive comments.","Kolkata police defend the arrest of instagram influencer sharmistha panoli.

In every Council of Ministers meeting, different government departments make detailed presentations about schemes and programmes, and their progress to apprise all the ministers.Sources said a discussion on the precision strikes on terror bases in Pakistan under Operation Sindoor and the thrust on public outreach to mark the 11th year of the Modi government are likely to feature in the meeting. Earlier, the PM had briefed cabinet ministers and had asked them to avoid making political commentary.Some time ago, Modi had advised his ministers to be thoroughly prepared before speaking on any issue in public and is said to have emphasised the importance of preparation by citing his own example, sharing that he meticulously reviews all details and prepares carefully before making any public address.Recently, some cabinet ministers were given a bunch of important articles published in newspapers and magazines on Operation Sindoor and its significance so that they get a full perspective of India’s all-out crackdown on terrorists and terrorism. The articles, including their Hindi translations, were shared with ministers after the last cabinet meeting held earlier this month.","Prime minister narendra modi is scheduled to hold the first meeting of the council of ministers this week after operation sindoor.

Poll Do you believe the couple deserved a refund for their unused train tickets? Yes, they should be refunded No, it was their choice

BENGALURU: A senior citizen couple from Hoodi in Whitefield took on the railways and won after being denied refund for a train journey they never made, as their reserved coach was overcrowded and inaccessible, forcing them to return home. Bengaluru Urban II additional district consumer commission has pulled up South Western Railway (SWR) for deficiency in service and ordered a full refund along with litigation costs.The case, earlier dismissed by the forum on July 1, 2023, was challenged again by the couple at the state commission. The appeal was allowed, with the state commission setting aside the earlier order and directing the forum to readmit the complaint.The story began when Purna Ramakrishna and his wife Hymavathi booked sleeper class tickets on Guwahati Express for March 29, 2022, from Krishnarajapuram (KJM) Railway Station to Vijayawada on April 13, paying Rs 892.5 for the trip. On the day of the journey, after reaching the station by auto (spending Rs 165), the couple was shocked to find their S2 coach - and the entire train - packed with passengers, making it impossible for them to board.With no railway staff around to assist, they were forced to abandon the journey and return home.Despite several representations and email follow-ups, the railways neither refunded the ticket fare nor offered any explanation or compensation. Left with no option, the elderly couple filed a consumer complaint citing service lapses.In their complaint, they said they informed the railways post-departure and expected a ticket deposit receipt (TDR) to be raised. But no TDR was filed and no refund or compensation issued.However, the railways, in its defence, denied any service deficiency, claiming that the train was not overcrowded when it arrived at the station. In their written response, railway officials acknowledged their tickets, further stating the train was fully reserved and unreserved travel was restored across the division after Covid. Therefore, they argued, the couple's claims of overcrowding by unauthorised passengers were ""false and baseless"".The railways said 134 passengers boarded from KJM on April 13 with no overcrowding complaints - except the elderly couple. Officials noted the duo didn't report any issue to the station master or RPF on duty, and no crowding was flagged by staff on board.Calling the duo's decision not to board a personal choice, the railways denied any service lapse. It also cited refund rules, saying confirmed tickets are non-refundable unless cancelled or a TDR is filed four hours before departure.However, the railways' own letter dated May 6, 2022, had admitted a spike in ticketless travel and called for issuing unreserved tickets to curb revenue loss - a point the consumer forum said backed the couple's claim.Holding the railways responsible for the couple being unable to board the crowded train during its two-minute halt at 11.53 pm at KJM, the panel said internal records can't override on-ground realities. It ruled the couple faced financial loss and mental agony due to a clear deficiency in service, especially when the full fare was collected.In March this year, the consumer commission ordered the railways to refund Rs 892.5 and pay the complainants Rs 5,000 for deficiency of service, mental agony, and Rs 3000 as litigation costs.","Purna ramakrishna and his wife hymavathi booked sleeper class tickets on guwahati express for march 29, 2022, from krishnarajapuram (kjm) railway station to vijayawada.

KOLKATA: The era of ""appeasement politics"" in Bengal is over as BJP primes itself to form the next government in 2026 with the supportThe era of “appeasement politics” in Bengal is over as BJP primes itself to form the next government in 2026 with the support of its core Hindu constituency and women voters moving away from CM Mamata Banerjee ’s party, home minister Amit Shah said Sunday while echoing a sentiment ignited by PM Narendra Modi in north Bengal last week.“Bengal’s women won’t tolerate any insult to sindoor,” Shah declared at Kolkata’s Netaji Indoor Stadium.He said CM Mamata taking potshots at PM Modi amid India’s Operation Sindoor targeting terrorist sites in Pakistan indicated whose side she was on. “It would have been better if she were pained by Bengalis getting killed (in violence within Bengal). She didn’t utter a word then.”Shah alleged that the recent violence in Murshidabad linked to anti-waqf law protests was a “state-sponsored” riot. “The state government did not seek help from BSF despite repeated alerts from us. Finally, BSF intervened after the high court’s order. Trinamool netas were accusing BSF and encouraging the rioters…The CM opposed the waqf amendments. Who was she trying to protect?” The home minister said the next elections in Bengal were not only about Bengal’s future, but also national security.“Mamata Banerjee has opened the nation’s borders to Bangladeshis.She is allowing infiltration. We asked her for land to fence the gaps. She isn’t providing it so that infiltration continues, her vote bank keeps growing, and her nephew becomes the CM. But this is not going to happen,” he said.Shah said it was painful to see Bengal plumb the depths, first under Left Front’s governance, and now TMC “For years, Bengal led India in every field. But then came the communists, and after that, Mamata Didi took charge with the slogan of ‘Maa, Mati, Manush’. She has since turned this great land into the hub of infiltration, corruption, atrocities on women, bomb blasts and injustice against Hindus,” he said.“During elections and even after Didi’s victory, hundreds of BJP workers were brutally killed. Didi, how long will you hide them? Mark my words — your time is over.” Shah said under UPA, Bengal received Rs 2.09 lakh crore, whereas under Modi, it received Rs 8.27 lakh crore in 10 years. But the money was “looted by the TMC syndicate”, he said.“Even if Modiji sends Rs 50 lakh crore, it won’t reach the people unless BJP is in government here. To get Modiji’s benefits and homes, you must bring a BJP government in Bengal,” Shah told the crowd.He later inaugurated a Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) in Rajarhat.","With sindoor focus, bjp eyes tmc's core female vote bank. “bengal’s women won’t tolerate any insult to sindoor,” amit shah declared.

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court observed that a case in which the judgment was rendered by a foreign court, and was also sub judice in India, must be heard at length. The court of Additional Sessions Judge Sumit Dass made the observation on May 5 while hearing the submissions of Shravan Gupta, an accused in a money laundering case.Gupta was convicted by a court in Abu Dhabi last year for the same offences as charged by the Enforcement Directorate - fraud, deception, and embezzlement. Gupta and six others, including a private company, filed a revision petition against a magisterial court order of November 2024 in which the court issued them and others summons for the offences of fraud and cheating.Meanwhile, the court stayed proceedings in the matter until July 4, the next hearing date. The court also issued notice to the ED and the state to file a reply in the matter.The case is related to a complaint filed by Emaar India Limited against MGF Development Limited, Gupta and 11 others for large-scale fraud and siphoning of Rs 180 crore.In April, Gupta moved an application before the court, submitting that on February 27, 2024, a court in Abu Dhabi had convicted of the same offences as in the present case. ""Passing of the said judgment was concealed by the complainant from this court as well as from the trial court,"" the plea stated.Gupta pleaded that he cannot be prosecuted again, and the impugned order deserves to be set aside. The entire prosecution is bad in law in view of Article 20(2) of the Constitution of India as well as Section 300 CrPC, Gupta stated.","A delhi court observed that a case in which the judgment was rendered by a foreign court, and was also sub judice in india, must be heard at length.

Not only eliminating Maoists but also Naxalism's roots: CM

RAIPUR: Chhattisgarh CM Vishnudeo Sai said targeted welfare programmes and sustained security ops have dismantled Maoist networks across Bastar and laid the groundwork for enduring peace.In an interview with TOI, Sai declared a turning point after 18 months of intense counter-insurgency efforts.""Our approach combines robust security measures with a strong emphasis on addressing root causes through development & inclusive policies. We aim to achieve a Naxal-free Chhattisgarh by March 31, '26.""A combination of targeted welfare programmes and sustained security operations has dismantled Maoist networks across Bastar and laid groundwork for enduring peace, Chhattisgarh CM Vishnu Deo Sai told TOI.Sai declared a turning point after 18 months of intense counter-insurgency efforts, which included the killing of CPI (Maoist) general secretary Basavaraju on May 21.""Our approach combines robust security measures with a strong emphasis on addressing root causes through development and inclusive policies,"" he said. ""We aim to achieve a Naxal-free Chhattisgarh by March 31, 2026."" The CM said his government plans to transform tribal-majority Bastar as well as the state through education, skilling, welfare projects, and inclusive policies.Government forces have penetrated deep into forested terrain long considered inaccessible, setting up security camps that now act as outposts of governance. These camps are enabling the spread of basic services and infrastructure in isolated tribal areas. The CM said these camps will remain as long as necessary.""Security has improved dramatically, there's a sharp decline in violence and 1,355 Maoists have surrendered,"" Sai said. ""Our surrender and rehabilitation policy has successfully reintegrated former Naxals, while initiatives like Niyad Nella Nar Yojana are promoting growth and stability in villages within a 10km radius of security camps.""Asked about public protests against blanket amnesty for hardcore Maoists, Sai struck a conciliatory tone. ""I understand the pain and anger of families who have lost loved ones. Their suffering is immeasurable,"" he said. ""The government is committed to ensuring justice and addressing their concerns with utmost sensitivity. The surrender policy is constantly under review. We are committed to finding the right balance between encouraging surrender and ensuring accountability. ""Critics have alleged that anti-Maoist operations are paving the way for mining interests. Sai dismissed these concerns. ""Such allegations are unfounded. Our government's primary focus is the development and well-being of Bastar and its people,"" he said. Addressing controversy over mining in the Hasdeo forest, Sai acknowledged the complexities in balancing development with indigenous rights. ""We are committed to a path of responsible and inclusive development. This involves engaging with tribal communities, respecting their traditional rights over land and resources, and ensuring they benefit from development projects.""He credited the ""double engine government"" - a term often used to describe BJP-led governments at both state and central levels - for accelerating Bastar's transformation. ""Under the guidance of PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, Bastar is witnessing transformative development,"" he said.""Effective policy implementation and better resource allocation are possible because of this synergy."" Sai emphasised a broader vision for the state beyond mining. ""Chhattisgarh is more than just a mineral-rich state,"" he said.""Recently, we conducted bhoomi pujan for a semiconductor manufacturing unit and an AI data centre in Nava Raipur. Many IT companies have shown interest in investing here.""He said Chhattisgarh ranks among the most progressive states in governance and innovation. ""Even Bastar, once overshadowed by conflict, has begun attracting investment. We are witnessing a revival of cultural pride and local economic activity, marking a new era of hope.

NEW DELHI: Empanelment of hospitals under the Ayushman Bharat-PM Jan Arogya Yojana has dropped significantly, from an average of 316 per month in 2024 to 111 per month in 2025, as of April.Data shared by National Health Authority (NHA) on scheme's dashboard shows that 443 hospitals were empanelled under the AB-PMJAY across India in four months - 161 in Jan, 187 in Feb, 40 in March and 55 in April. In May, the latest update shows, 20 hospitals were empanelled.Many healthcare associations point out that low package rates and delayed payments are key reasons behind the lukewarm response to government schemes from the private sector, especially large corporate hospital chains.However, a senior official of NHA - the implementing agency of the AB-PMJAY - said empanelment is taking place and that some of the new empanelments may not have been updated as they were migrating to a new system.AB-PMJAY, which is available in all states/UTs, except West Bengal, offers treatment worth Rs 5 lakh and, in some cases, more, per family for treatment of nearly 2,000 procedures involving specialties, including medical oncology (cancer treatment), emergency care, orthopaedic and urology (kidney-related ailments).The CEO of a top hospital chain in Delhi, the latest state to join the scheme, told TOI that package rates offered for various procedures under the AB-PMJAY were lower than their input cost. ""We may join the scheme if the package rates are increased,"" he said.The Indian Medical Association has also stressed on the need to increase package rates to make treatment under the scheme more sustainable. ""The rates should be raised to at least CGHS level,"" said an IMA office-bearer.As many as 609 private hospitals have opted out of the scheme since 2018, minister of state for health Prataprao Jadhav said in a written response to a Parliament question in March.""The reasons for hospitals voluntarily opting out include empanelment only for Covid period, hospitals were closed or non-functional, changes in hospital entity, hospital relocated, ongoing reconstruction or renovation, unavailability of specialist doctors, voluntary withdrawal from scheme, package rates, opting out due to certain treatment packages reserved for public hospitals only (Chhattisgarh and Gujarat), and no referral from public hospitals (Karnataka),"" he added.","Ayushman enrolments see dip as private hospitals back off over rates, delays.
