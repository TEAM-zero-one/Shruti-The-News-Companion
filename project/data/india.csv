NEW DELHI: Two aircraft, one each of Air India and IndiGo, had taken off safely from RanchiMonday night around the same time as the ill-fated air ambulance that crashed soon after getting airborne.After climbing to 6,000 feet, the pilots of the air ambulance had sought weather deviation from Kolkata ATC and then the Beechcraft C90 aircraft VT-AJV crashed.Ranchi was having bad weather at that time, with cumulonimbus (thunderstorm) clouds at 3,000 feet. An IndiGo aircraft had taken off eight minutes before the air ambulance crashed. ""After getting airborne and in a couple of minutes when the IndiGo aircraft was about 37 km away from Ranchi airport, it had requested a right turn to avoid weather,"" sources said.Unfortunately, the small air ambulance crashed just eight minutes after the relatively bigger airliners had flown away safely in this weather.

Prioritising safety over commercial interests:

Enhanced oversight and accountability:

NEW DELHI: Jolted by two crashes involving small charter aircraft within a month that killed 12 people, India may soon rank non scheduled operator permit (NSOP) or charter and private jet operators based on their safety record.While this ranking is proposed to be released on the Directorate General of Civil Aviation's (DGCA) website, operators will now mandatorily have to disclose ""critical safety information on their websites, including aircraft age, maintenance history, and pilot experience."" This will be done to ensure people are ""fully informed about the standards"" of the aircraft they charter.Also, there will now be stricter penalties for operators violating norms regarding aircraft or crew utilisation. While pilots found violating flight duty time limitations (FDTL) or attempting to land below safety minima may face license suspensions of up to five years, operators not meeting compliance standards will have their licenses suspended.The regulator Tuesday met all NSOP or charter/private jet operators to ""address a recent surge in aviation incidents"" and emphasise on ""critical need for increased focus on safety.""Non-adherence to standard operating procedures (SOPs), inadequate flight planning, and training deficiencies were identified and the primary cause of accidents at this meeting.Following the meet, the DGCA issued ""new measures aimed at enforcing a zero-tolerance policy toward safety compromises within the NSOP sector."" These include:The regulator has directed that safety must supersede all commercial considerations, charter commitments or VIP movements. It reaffirmed that the pilot-in-command's decision to divert, delay, or cancel a flight for safety reasons is final and must be respected by operators without commercial consequences.Apart from DGCA doing safety ranking of NSOPs and the latter disclosing their fleet and crew information, the regulator will The authority will conduct increased random cockpit voice recorder (CVR) audits and cross-verify fuel records, and technical logs to detect unauthorised operations or falsifying of data.""Accountable managers and senior leadership will be held personally responsible for systemic non-compliances, safety lapses cannot simply be blamed on pilots,"" the regulator says. There will now be increased monitoring of older aircraft and those undergoing ownership changes. NSOPs that run their own maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) facilities will be audited. ""Those found lacking adequacy will be required to outsource maintenance to approved organisations.""The regulator has found weather-related accidents are ""often the result of poor judgment rather than unpredictability of weather."" Operators are mandated to establish real-time weather update systems and strict compliance of established SOPs. Additionally, recurrent training for pilots must have greater emphasis on weather awareness strategies and decision-making in uncontrolled environments.To address systemic weaknesses in decision-making and to ensure operational discipline, the regulator is implementing several immediate measures. A senior official who was at the meeting said: ""The message is clear to NSOP operators: Either operate with 100% compliance of all norms or surrender your licence and go home. They have to fall in line or be out of business.""","India may soon rank non scheduled operator permit (nsop) or charter and private jet operators based on their safety record.

An official release said that after receiving the state assembly's views, Centre will take action and obtain the President's recommendation for introduction of the Bill in Parliament.In 2011, the spelling of Orissa was changed to Odisha.People aware of the development said the cabinet note highlighted how, from the beginning, people of Kerala had been vociferously demanding that the state be named Keralam. However, when it was officially created on Nov 1, 1956, it was named Kerala. Since then, the demand has been raised repeatedly.Earlier, the state assembly had passed resolutions in 2023 and 2024 requesting Centre to amend the Constitution and modify the state's name from Kerala to Keralam.The resolutions were moved by CM Pinarayi Vijayan, and only last month state BJP president Rajeev Chandrasekhar had written to the CM extending his party's support.The Cabinet proposal included the June 2024 resolution passed by the state assembly, which mentioned the name of the state in Malayalam is Keralam and that states were reorganised on linguistic lines on Nov 1, 1956, observed as Kerala Piravi (Kerala Formation Day).

NEW DELHI: In a sweeping crackdown on air pollution, the Maharashtra government has issued stop-work notices to more than 1,000 construction sites across Mumbai, with nearly 88 per cent of active projects facing action for violating environmental norms, Environment Minister Pankaja Munde informed the state legislative assembly on Tuesday.Presenting data from October 2025 to January 2026 under the ongoing “clean air” initiative, Munde said 1,047 stop-work notices and 1,981 show-cause notices were served to errant sites as authorities tightened enforcement against dust and pollution violations.Of the 2,224 active construction projects in the city, 1,952 — about 88 per cent — have installed low-cost air quality sensors, while the remaining faced strict penalties.On January 16 alone, 678 projects were ordered to halt operations for failing to comply with mandatory sensor installation norms, underscoring the government’s push for technology-driven monitoring of pollution sources.“We are following a strict escalation matrix for violators. Construction projects failing to adhere to dust-mitigation guidelines are first given a formal intimation, followed by a show-cause notice, and then a stop-work order if they remain non-compliant,” Munde said in a written reply on AQI levels.The minister asserted that Mumbai’s air quality has largely remained within the ‘satisfactory’ (51–100) and ‘moderate’ (101–200) categories. Refuting allegations of a public health crisis, she cited reports from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC), which recorded no adverse health impacts among vulnerable groups such as children and senior citizens during the fluctuation in air quality.As part of intensified enforcement, the BMC’s 25 ward-level flying squads have been targeting illegal debris transport, collecting over Rs 1.21 lakh in fines during the four months.To tackle the city’s persistent dust problem, authorities have also deployed 126 water tankers and 25 misting machines, washing over 14,408 kilometres of roads.","The maharashtra government has issued stop-work notices to more than 1,000 construction sites across mumbai.

Need mechanism to make voting mandatory: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/need-mechanism-to-make-voting-mandatory-supreme-court/articleshow/128766075.cms,"It’s for Parl to decide if any amendment is needed: AG to SC



NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday said some mechanism needs to be devised, not necessarily punitive, to make voting compulsory so that democracy gets stronger by attracting more eligible people to contest elections and render Nota option redundant.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said the Nota option was devised to attract better candidates to the fray and to encourage voters to exercise their franchise. The decade-long experience shows that a minuscule percentage of voters exercised the option, the bench said.These observations came from the bench which was hearing a PIL by Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy which argued for making Nota a candidate in the constituencies where only one candidate is in the fray to find out whether the lone contestant had the confidence of voters.Senior advocate Arvind Datar said that putting Nota on the ballot as a candidate would discourage the candidates with money and muscle power to make their opponents withdraw from the contest. The bench pointed out that to make Nota a candidate, Parliament would be required to carry out an amendment to the Representation of People Act. Attorney general R Venktaramani said when voting is not a fundamental right how could a PIL under Article 32, which is the recourse to approach SC directly in case of violation of fundamental rights, be maintainable.Senior advocate Arvind Datar said putting Nota on the ballot as a candidate would discourage the candidates with money and muscle power to make their opponents withdraw from the contest.Attorney general R Venktaramani said when voting is not a fundamental right how could a PIL under Article 32, which is the recourse to approach SC directly in case of violation of fundamental rights, be maintainable.“Let judiciary not decide what amendments are to be carried out in the RP Act. It is for Parliament to decide if any deficiency is required to be remedied or any amendment is to be carried out in a statute,” said the attorney general.The bench said it is the educated and well-off people who do not come out in large numbers to vote, which is in stark contrast to the people in rural areas where voting day resembles a festival that everyone celebrates by exercising their franchise.Govt in its affidavit had opposed the PIL and said, “Nota option is not a person which has been duly nominated at any election, hence cannot be held to be a candidate under Representation of People Act, 1951. ‘Nota’ ought not to be given an artificial personality. ‘Nota’ is merely an option or an expression and does not fit within definition of ‘candidate’.”","A bench of cji surya kant and justice joymalya bagchi said the nota option was devised to attract better candidates to the fray.

NEW DELHI: What slows down a court case, why public trust in courts matters, and how corruption can affect access to justice are now questions Class 8 students will encounter in their civics textbook, with the latest NCERT social science book explicitly listing corruption, massive case pendency and shortage of judges as challenges facing India’s judicial system.The revised chapter, titled ‘The Role of the Judiciary in Our Society’, forms part of the new class VIII social science textbook released by the National Council of Educational Research and Training.Unlike earlier editions that focused largely on the structure of courts, judicial independence and access to justice, the updated chapter includes a detailed section on the problems confronting the judicial system.The book states that “people do experience corruption at various levels of the judiciary” and notes that for “the poor and the disadvantaged, this can worsen the issue of access to justice”. It adds that efforts are being made at both State and Union levels to “build faith and increase transparency in the judicial system, including through the use of technology, and to take swift and decisive action against instances of corruption wherever they may arise”.Highlighting the scale of pendency, the textbook pegs pending cases at around 81,000 in the Supreme Court, 62.4 lakh in high courts, and 4.7 crore in district and subordinate courts.It attributes the backlog of cases to several factors, including an inadequate number of judges, complicated legal procedures and weak infrastructure.A separate section in the civics chapter explains that judges are bound by a code of conduct governing their behaviour both inside and outside courtrooms.It refers to internal accountability mechanisms and an established procedure for receiving complaints through the Centralised Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS), noting that more than 1,600 complaints were received between 2017 and 2021.The chapter also quotes former Chief Justice of India B R Gavai, who in July 2025 said that instances of corruption and misconduct within the judiciary “inevitably have a negative impact on public confidence”.“However, the path to rebuilding this trust lies in the swift, decisive and transparent action taken to address and resolve these issues… Transparency and accountability are democratic virtues,” he is quoted as saying.","The latest ncert social science book explicitly lists corruption, massive case pendency and shortage of judges as challenges facing india’s judicial system.

NEW DELHI: A political row erupted on Tuesday after the Centre approved the Kerala government’s proposal to rename the state “Keralam,” with West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee questioning why a similar proposal for her state remains pending.Hitting out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, Banerjee described them as “Bangla-birodhi” (anti-Bengal).“Smt. @MamataOfficial warmly congratulated the people of Kerala on the Union Cabinet’s approval to rename their state ‘Keralam’. At the same time, she reminded the Centre that a similar proposal to rename West Bengal as ‘Bangla’ has been pending for years,” the Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) posted on X.“Every election season, @narendramodi and @AmitShah descend on Bengal, shedding crocodile tears and pretending to love our soil, our culture, our people.

These Bangla-birodhis have no respect for our heritage, no regard for our language, no honour for our icons, and zero concern for our dignity,” the party added, quoting Banerjee.The TMC further said that while it ""rejoices"" when any state “asserts its identity,” West Bengal would not accept what it termed the BJP-led Centre’s “vindictive discrimination.”“Bengal’s legitimate demand cannot be denied purely because we refuse to bow before @BJP4India’s high command,” it stated.The Banerjee-led government, in office since 2011, had passed a resolution in July 2018 to rename West Bengal as “Bangla” and has reiterated the demand to the Centre on multiple occasions.The decision to clear Kerala’s name change comes ahead of assembly elections in the state, expected in April.

NEW DELHI: Jolted by two crashes involving small charter aircraft within a month that killed 12 people, India could now rank non scheduled operator permit (NSOP) or charter and private jet operators based on their safety record. While this ranking is proposed to put on the Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s (DGCA) website, operators will now mandatorily have to disclose “critical safety information on their websites, including aircraft age, maintenance history, and pilot experience.” This will be done to ensure people are “fully informed about the standards” of the aircraft they charter.Also, there will now be stricter penalties for operators violating norms regarding aircraft or crew utilisation. While pilots found violating flight duty time limitations (FDTL) or attempting to land below safety minima may face license suspensions of up to five years, operators not meeting compliance standards will have their licenses suspended.The regulator Tuesday held a meeting with all NSOP or charter/private jet operators to “address a recent surge in aviation incidents” and emphasise on “critical need for increased focus on safety.”Non-adherence to standard operating procedures (SOPs), inadequate flight planning, and training deficiencies were identified and the primary cause of accidents at this meeting.Also, charter companies doing their own maintenance and not doing the same as per standards will now be asked to outsource that to recognised MROs. ""Maximum issues in NSOP operations are about aircraft maintenance and poor judgment by operations teams,” said an industry insider.Following the meet, the DGCA issued “new measures aimed at enforcing a zero-tolerance policy toward safety compromises within the NSOP sector.” These include:The regulator has directed that safety must supersede all commercial considerations, charter commitments or VIP movements. It reaffirmed that the pilot-in-command's decision to divert, delay, or cancel a flight for safety reasons is final and must be respected by operators without commercial consequences.Apart from DGCA doing safety ranking of NSOPs and the latter disclosing their fleet and crew information, the regulator will The authority will conduct increased random cockpit voice recorder (CVR) audits and cross-verify fuel records, and technical logs to detect unauthorised operations or falsifying of data.“Accountable managers and senior leadership will be held personally responsible for systemic non-compliances, safety lapses cannot simply be blamed on pilots,” the regulator says. There will now be increased monitoring of older aircraft and those undergoing ownership changes. NSOPs that run their own maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) facilities will be audited. “Those found lacking adequacy will be required to outsource maintenance to approved organisations. ”The regulator has found weather-related accidents are “often the result of poor judgment rather than unpredictability of weather."" Operators are mandated to establish real-time weather update systems and strict compliance of established SOPs. Additionally, recurrent training for pilots must have greater emphasis on weather awareness strategies and decision-making in uncontrolled environments.To address systemic weaknesses in decision-making and to ensure operational discipline, the regulator is implementing several immediate measures:A senior official who was at the meeting said: “The message is clear to NSOP operators: Either operate with 100% compliance of all norms or surrender your licence and go home. They have to fall in line or be out of business.”","India could rank non scheduled operator permit (nsop) or charter and private jet operators based on their safety record.

India to launch HPV vax drive for 14-year-old girls this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-launch-hpv-vax-drive-for-14-year-old-girls-this-month/articleshow/128766601.cms,".

NEW DELHI: In a major preventive health push against cervical cancer, the Centre is set to roll out a nationwide human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination drive for 14-year-old girls later this month, offering the shot free of cost at govt health facilities across the country.The campaign will target girls turning 14 each year, covering an annual cohort of approximately 1.2 crore adolescents across India. The vaccination will be voluntary and provided at designated govt health centres.Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among Indian women, which causes nearly 80,000 new cases and over 42,000 deaths annually. Persistent infection with high-risk HPV types, particularly 16 and 18, accounts for more than 80% of cases.The move follows sustained emphasis at the highest level. PM Modi has repeatedly highlighted cervical cancer prevention, calling for vaccination, early screening and affordable treatment, including at the Quad Cancer Moonshot event in Sept 2024.Unlike routine immunisation under the Universal Immunisation Programme, the HPV drive will be conducted as a special campaign on designated immunisation days and tracked through the U-WIN digital platform to ensure rapid coverage.The vaccine, Gardasil, protects against HPV types 16 and 18, along with 6 and 11. Gavi has committed 2.6 crore doses, with about 1.5 crore already delivered. Officials estimate roughly almost 1.2 crore doses will be needed annually to cover girls turning 14 each year.Globally, over 500 million doses of the vaccine have been administered.Dr Abhishek Shankar from the department of radiation oncology at AIIMS described the rollout as a historic step that strengthens India's push to eliminate cervical cancer, protect lakhs of girls from a preventable disease and reduces the future treatment burden in line with the WHO elimination goal.Dr Pragya Shukla, head of clinical oncology at Delhi State Cancer Institute, said, ""vaccination before sexual debut is critical, as HPV infection is silent and irreversible, and the vaccine is safe and proven"".India's single-dose strategy is backed by global evidence.","Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among indian women.

Just because the authorities slept over the encroachment, it does not become your land. When it is public land, it is the state’s prerogative to decide how to use it, and the occupiers cannot dictate its use.“The only question is that when there is humanitarian concern, what best solution could be found to the problem. The concerns give rise to a privilege, not a right,” it said.The court had recorded that approximately 30 hectares of land, owned by Indian Railways/State,was allegedly encroached upon.Further, 4,365 houses are said to have been constructed at the site, where over 50,000 people are living.Responding to SC’s earlier directive for identification of land for rehabilitation of the unauthorised occupants, additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati said that finding land in the hilly state was difficult but added that if the occupiers applied for houses under PMAY, the eligible ones would be allotted dwelling units either in the state or in Uttar Pradesh.The bench recorded the offer of the railways and state govt to pay Rs 2,000 per month for each demolished house for six months to enable their residents to take up places on rent. The counsel said that the camp could be set up after March 19.","The court had recorded that approximately 30 hectares of land, owned by indian railways/state,was allegedly encroached upon. 4,365 houses are said to have been constructed at the site, where over 50,000 people are living.

No question of Aadhaar being used to claim citizenship: Supreme Court



Judges on SIR work get bomb threats



NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday permitted the Calcutta HC chief justice to requisition judicial officers from neighbouring Jharkhand and Odisha to help such officers in West Bengal in expeditiously scrutinising and determining validity of claims of voters falling under 'logical discrepancy' or 'unmapped' categories of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral roll process.These voters in WB have been put under the categories because of, what Election Commission (EC) considers, illogical inconsistencies in their details, documents and family tree.The order came from a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi after the Calcutta HC CJ informed that though 294 serving and retired district judges and additional district judges have been assigned SIR work, they would take at least 80 days to scrutinise documents of 50 lakh voters in these two categories even if each judicial officer decided 250 cases a day.The bench allowed the Calcutta HC CJ to draft judicial officers in the state with three years' experience for SIR work and said if more additional hands are required to complete the task expeditiously, then he could requisition similarly experienced judicial officers from neighbouring Jharkhand and Odisha.Significantly, the bench said EC will be publishing the final voter list on Feb 28 containing the names of all those who have been verified.However, as the process of verifying the 50 lakh voters' documents along with claims would take some time, EC would be publishing supplementary voter lists after Feb 28.SC said the 11 documents notified by EC for SIR work as well as with Class X examination admit card along with marksheet would be considered as valid documents to claim inclusion in the voter list, while making clear yet again that Aadhaar would be used only for identification purposes.""There is no question of Aadhaar card being used to claim citizenship,"" the bench said, adding that only cases of voters who have submitted their documents by Feb 14 will be verified by the judicial officers while determining their claim for inclusion in the voter list.Invoking its powers under Article 142, the bench said the supplementary voter lists would be deemed to be part of the final list published on Feb 28. Laying importance on completion of SIR of WB's voter list, the bench said the Calcutta HC CJ would request his counterparts in Jharkhand and Orissa HCs for additional hands - civil judges with three-year experience - to help in verification of documents and claims of voters bracketed in 'logical discrepancy' and 'unmapped' categories.

NEW DELHI: Taking forward the “reform express” theme, PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday asked his cabinet colleagues to suggest a list of reforms their ministries intend to initiate over the next few months and provide details of changes already introduced, reports Dipak Dash. He asked them to focus on two themes — ease of living and ease of doing business — while preparing the proposed reform list.TOI has learnt that the PM made these suggestions while chairing the first Cabinet meeting at Seva Teerth, where a resolution was adopted that every decision taken on the premises will be inspired by sentiment of ‘Nagrik Devo Bhava’, and that it will serve as a centre for empowerment of every Indian, not a place for display of power.Already, railway ministry has announced its plan to undertake 52 reforms in 52 weeks, some of which have been rolled out. Several other ministries are finalising ‘non-financial regulatory reforms’ that can be implemented without amending Acts. Soon after the meeting, some ministers asked staff to identify more reform areas.","Pm narendra modi asked his cabinet colleagues to suggest a list of reforms their ministries intend to initiate over the next few months.
