'Only Mistake I Made Was...': Prajwal Revanna Tells Court Before Life Sentence In Rape Case

Poll Do you think protests will effectively change the political situation in Punjab? Yes No





PATIALA: AAP MLA Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra has allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.According to Punjab Police sources, Pathanmajra and his accomplices fired at police officers during the escape and even ran over one personnel, leaving him injured.According to reports, Pathanmajra and his accomplices ran over police personnel with an SUV.The Sanour MLA was arrested a day after publicly criticising his party’s Delhi leadership.His detention in Patiala was linked to a rape case filed against him, sparking political uproar in the region.In a social media post, Pathanmajra claimed the case related to his former wife and alleged that the fresh charges of rape were politically motivated.“I was booked because I raised my voice against my own government, especially the Delhi leadership,” he wrote.His brother, Hardev Singh, said the MLA was taken into custody under Section 376 of the IPC despite already having been granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. “He was arrested from Dabri in Haryana in a case where bail was already granted. This is clearly an attempt to silence him,” he alleged.CIA Patiala confirmed that three weapons have been recovered and one accomplice of MLA Pathanmajra has been arrested.The arrested individual has been identified as Balwinder Singh, while the search for MLA Pathanmajra continues.Police said two officers were injured when stones were thrown at them during the MLA’s escape attempt.Authorities added that supporters of the MLA not only pelted stones but also opened fire at the police team.Before his arrest, Pathanmajra had appealed to colleagues and supporters via Facebook to protest outside the Patiala SSP’s office at the Mini Secretariat. He urged people to reach “in tractors, trolleys, and cars” to demand his release. “I will not be silenced even if more cases are registered against me. Will AAP’s Delhi leadership rule Punjabis now? Even Congress and BJP did not interfere to this extent,” he said.The MLA has repeatedly accused the party’s central leadership of sidelining Punjab leaders and “remote-controlling” the state. Recently, he criticised officials of the Irrigation Department over flood relief efforts in his constituency. Soon after, his security cover was withdrawn and police officers in the area were reshuffled — moves that raised eyebrows.“This is retaliation. They looted Punjab more than Abdali. Now they want to sell Punjab,” Pathanmajra declared.","Harmeet singh pathanmajra allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.

Hardoi Instagram Missing Husband: 30-sec reel helps UP woman locate hubby who died 7 years back; living with second wife in Ludhiana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/30-sec-reel-helps-woman-locate-hubby-who-died-7-years-back/articleshow/123663305.cms,"The seven-year vanishing act

The reel that became evidence





LUCKNOW: Forget CID, forget private detectives. In Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh, a wife solved a seven-year-old mystery with just a casual Instagram scroll.Back in April 2017, Sheelu of Murarnagar, Sandila, married Jitendra Kumar (32), better known in his village as Babloo. A few months later, the couple was expecting their first child. But instead of fatherhood, Babloo chose a disappearing act. In 2018, he suddenly vanished without a trace.His family, rather than helping Sheelu search, accused her of murdering him and hiding the body. A missing person’s report was lodged at Sandila police station, but the case soon went cold. For years, Sheelu carried the stigma of being suspected as a “husband killer,” while raising her son alone.Fast-forward to 2025. While scrolling Instagram reels, Sheelu spotted a man dancing happily in Ludhiana. The problem? It wasn’t just any man. It was Babloo — alive, grooving, and flaunting a new woman by his side, who police later confirmed was his second wife.“Sheelu waited seven years. Then one reel ended the suspense,” quipped a police officer involved in the investigation.Furious, Sheelu made the reel viral, then filed a formal complaint.Acting swiftly, Circle Officer Santosh Kumar Singh and his Sandila team — SI Ranjanikant Pandey, Head Constable Diwakar Mishra, and Constable Sunil Kumar — tracked Babloo down in Ludhiana, where he was working at a cloth factory and living a double life. He was arrested under Section 82(1) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (bigamy).Police said Sheelu and Babloo married in 2017, and their son was born in 2018. Just weeks after the child’s birth, Babloo went missing. His family claimed ignorance but secretly filed a complaint suggesting foul play by Sheelu.“Time passed, but he never returned,” Sheelu told reporters, recalling how she was left abandoned and stigmatised during pregnancy. She also alleged that before disappearing, Babloo became abusive, forcing her to return to her parents’ house in late 2017. She only learned he “vanished” when she was four months pregnant.For years, the case remained a mystery. Then came the Instagram reel.Sheelu described her shock when she spotted her missing husband online. Determined, she confronted her in-laws, who admitted the man looked like Babloo but offered no explanation. Meanwhile, residents began sharing the reel widely, and soon the entire district knew the man “long gone” was alive and well.The police investigation confirmed the reel’s authenticity and Babloo’s new life in Punjab. “During the inquiry, it was found that Jitendra married another woman in Ludhiana. He has been taken into custody,” said CO Santosh Singh.For Sheelu, the discovery was bittersweet. “I don’t know why he left me during my pregnancy, when I needed him the most,” she said, adding that her years of waiting ended not with closure, but with betrayal gone viral.","Sheelu married jitendra kumar (32), better known in his village as babloo, in 2017.

NEW DELHI: At an age when many women are busy caring for their grandchildren, a 55-year-old from Rajasthan’s Udaipur district has just welcomed her 17th child.The birth at the Community Health Centre in Jhadol block has turned Lilavas village into a talking point. Relatives, neighbours and villagers crowded the hospital to see Rekha, amused at the unusual sight of grandchildren greeting their new baby aunt, PTI reported.Rekha, married to scrap dealer Kavara Ram Kalbelia, has given birth 17 times over the years. Five of those children – four sons and one daughter – died soon after birth, leaving the couple with 12 surviving kids: seven boys and five girls.Their household spans three generations under one roof. ""Two of my sons and three of my daughters are married. Each of them has two or three children,"" Kavara said, his voice carrying both pride and weariness.This means while Rekha tends to her newborn, she is simultaneously grandmother to several toddlers.Behind the curiosity, however, lies hardship. Kavara makes a meagre living by selling scrap and admits to taking high-interest loans to pay for his children’s weddings. “No member of the family has ever gone to school,” he said, highlighting how poverty continues to dominate their lives.Doctors at the Jhadol centre described the delivery as a challenge. Rekha initially told them it was only her fourth pregnancy. Block CMHO Dr Dharmendra noted that the case reflects the difficulties in tribal-dominated areas, where lack of education and awareness often fuel such situations.“This is a nomadic family that keeps moving. Eleven surviving children were found with them. We will work to link them with government schemes and provide support,” he said.Gynaecologist Dr. Roshan Darangi, who handled the delivery, confirmed the truth later: “It turned out to be her 17th childbirth. Now, we will counsel her for sterilisation.”Another doctor, Mukesh Garasiya, added that Rekha had been admitted on August 24 without sonography or pre-delivery tests. “She could have died from excessive bleeding. With so many deliveries, the uterus weakens and the risk of haemorrhage rises. Thankfully, this time, everything went smoothly,” he explained.","Rekha ram kalbelia, 55, from rajasthan's udaipur district has just welcomed her 17th child. Five of those children – four sons and one daughter – died soon after birth, leaving the couple with 12 surviving kids. The household spans three generations under one roof.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123634773,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-145761,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Centre to build dozens of Ring Roads across cities to decongest urban highways,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-to-build-dozens-of-ring-roads-across-cities-to-decongest-urban-highways/articleshow/123682779.cms,"Centre to build dozens of Ring Roads across cities to decongest urban highways

NEW DELHI: It’s not just metros like Delhi and Bengaluru where vehicle speeds drop sharply as highways enter city limits. Govt data shared with states on Wednesday show that even in smaller cities such as Madurai in Tamil Nadu, the average speed on NHs can fall to just 27 kmph inside the city due to traffic congestion, compared to 55 kmph on highway stretches outside it.Aiming to remedy this growing problem of urban congestion, the Centre will take up development of around 34 new access-controlled Ring Roads, in addition to such 36 ongoing projects across cities. On Wednesday, road transport and highways ministry shared the roadmap with states while seeking support for fast-tracking the development of Ring Roads with a design speed of 100-120 kmph.Targeting to decongest NHs in urban areas, the road transport and highway ministry has identified agglomeration and cities with more than five lakh population for construction of the greenfield Ring Roads. These include Kolkata and Amaravati agglomerations, Nashik, Thiruvananthapuram, Ajmer, Warangal, Mangaluru, Udaipur and Tirunelveli. The details were shared with state PWD and urban development secretaries at a meeting chaired by road transport minister Nitin Gadkari.To ensure that new Ring Roads don’t end up becoming new choke points, 15 metres on either side of these stretches will be notified as Development Control Zone (DCZ) where no construction will be allowed, except for public utilities and green zone.States will allow regulated development in 2 km beyond the DCZ.For financing these capital intensive project, the states will have five different options to provide financial support, including upfront payment of 50% of cost and getting 50% of toll revenue for 15 years; payment of 50% of the land acquisition cost; and providing land pooled through land pooling scheme. Since states are the biggest beneficiary of such projects, they need to provide some share of the project cost, an official said.The ministry has also shared the details of 15 legacy municipal dump sites close to upcoming NH projects across states, which can provide inert waste for construction embankment of such roads. “Some of the high speed corridors and urban decongestion road projects have been mapped that are within 50 km of the top 15 landfill sites. Around 277 lakh tonne of inert waste from these dump sites can potentially be utilised (for highway construction),” said an official.In the closed door meeting, Gadkari said NH projects can significantly address the issue of legacy solid waste issues faced by cities. “Successful pilot projects, including UER-II in Delhi and Ahmedabad–Dholera Expressway, have demonstrated the technical feasibility and economic benefits of the initiative,” his office said.",Centre to build dozens of ring roads across cities to decongest urban highways.

School bells stop ringing in flood-hit North India as water cuts off access,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/school-bells-stop-ringing-in-flood-hit-north-india-as-water-cuts-off-access/articleshow/123684989.cms,"Suresh Rawat (15) still wakes at 6 am - he has never needed an alarm. Not because school is in session or a bell might echo through the hills, but because his routine - wake, wash, dress - is a habit rooted in pre-monsoon normalcy. Comb hair, button shirt, pack school bag. But he has nowhere to go. No teacher has checked its contents in over 60 days, after a bridge connecting his village in Uttarakhand to the local school was washed away in June.Across flood-hit north India - Punjab, Himachal, Uttarakhand, Jammu, parts of UP and now Haryana - students have been missing school and college because waters won't allow them, teachers can't reach and buildings won't stand.""The path to my school, 7 km from Kupda village in Uttarkashi, lay across that bridge,"" Suresh said. ""On June 28, the Yamunotri highway link disappeared. Now I'll have to study a lot on my own to make up for lost classes."" He despairs at the gap in front of him, with no sign of repair or even a temporary bridge - only the weight of an academic calendar slipping away.Punjab ordered schools shut in late August until September 7 - a 12-day stretch overlapping with peak harvest, compounding family losses.Himachal staggered its orders through July and August, as repeated landslides cut off access to schools and staff housing.In Jammu, schools were shut on Sept 1 and 2 after heavy rain warnings and flood risks. The order expanded the next day to Kashmir, where flood alerts followed the Chenab and Jhelum crossing danger marks. The Srinagar-Jammu highway stayed closed for days, severing supply routes and classroom routines alike.The storm has erased not just structures - Himachal alone reported damage to 500 schools - but the scaffolding of education. In Mandi, where 300 schools were affected, functioning buildings became shelters. Teachers vanished from WhatsApp groups, not by choice but because they were stranded. Unit tests were pushed into vagueness, then abandoned. Online lessons were announced for Sept 1, but for most, the only thing that arrived was another rain alert.Sunil Negi, who teaches in Kullu, tried to hold a class. ""The power went within minutes. Then signal dropped. We stopped trying,"" he said. Leena Kapoor in Mandi was more blunt: ""We've taught nothing new. Half the staff haven't returned. The school was a ration camp for two weeks.""In places where classrooms hadn't collapsed, access became the barrier. Rakesh Kumar, a govt teacher, described walking 5 km along a landslide-prone path just to reach his students. ""The road was blocked, but we tried anyway. It's the kind of risk no one wants to take, but we do it because otherwise, the children lose everything.""The more remote the school, the worse the loss. In Bharmour, paths once curving through hills have been wiped out. ""We used to carry the younger children on our shoulders,"" said Vikram Rana, a village elder. ""Now even the elders can't reach them."" Students relocated from landslide-prone areas are now simply unreachable.Makeshift arrangements haven't always worked. A sudden lake formation behind the school in Syanachatti, Uttarakhand, forced 56 students out; 25 were sent to Bajri Primary, others to rented rooms. But 18 children were never relocated. ""They've disappeared into a crevice in the system,"" a local education officer said. ""And that widens every day.""No meaningful plan has followed. There's been no revision of the exam calendar, no guidance on syllabus cuts, and no plan for remediation. Authorities have floated ideas - weekend sessions, compressed holidays - but without any infra, internet or staff, those promises ring hollow.The east hasn't been spared. In Assam's Majuli island, floodwaters returned for third time this season. Rashmi Das, 16, had just resumed classes when her school was converted into a shelter again. ""They said we'd reopen soon. Then the water came back.""And beyond ridgelines of Ladakh, where Aug brought rainfall 930% above normal, teacher Jigmet Tundup continued to show up to a classroom half-submerged each morning. ""We sweep water out,"" he said. ""Then we begin. Sometimes with the alphabet.""(With inputs from Rohit Mullick in Kullu, Ashish Mishra in Uttarkashi, Yogesh Nagarkoti in Bageshwar, and Tanmayee Tyagi in Dehradun)","Across flood-hit north india, students have been missing school and college because waters won't allow them.

Vaishno Devi landslide tragedy saddening: PM Modi

Another landslide struck the pilgrimage track leading to the Mata Vaishno Devi shrine in Jammu and Kashmir’s Reasi district on Wednesday.The landslide occurred at Sammar Point, blocking the route to the shrine.

Governor's absolute discretion on bills means negating people's will: West Bengal in Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/guvs-absolute-discretion-on-bills-means-negating-peoples-will-bengal-in-sc/articleshow/123685078.cms,"Constitution mandates guv to act as soon as possible: Sibal

NEW DELHI: West Bengal on Wednesday warned that vesting governors with discretion to decide the fate of bills would jeopardise states' legislative functions, while Supreme Court-prescribed timeline for governors and the President would expedite transforming people's will into laws. This would not amount to amending the Constitution, it told the court.The TMC govt, through senior advocate Kapil Sibal, told a bench of CJI B R Gavai, and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar that the Constitution does not assign to the governor a dominating position or a significant role in either the legislative or executive functioning of a state.Sibal said if the governor is given unbridled discretion and he decides to simply sit on a bill for years, it will amount to negating the will of the people which is expressed through the bill by the elected representatives in the state legislature.An interpretation that gives the governor the executive power to withhold assent upends the entire constitutional scheme,"" senior advocate Kapil Sibal added. If the Centre's argument is accepted, then it would enable the governor under Article 200 to avoid communication, bypass reasoning, and ignore the primacy of legislature and act on his own, he said.If one goes by the Centre's argument that the governor's decision regarding a bill is not amenable to judicial review, then he can veto any bill, he said, adding that the governor would become a super-constitutional office, a concept wholly alien and incompatible with constitutionalism, responsible govt, and democracy.The reading in of a timeline for the governor or President to take a decision on a bill has become of paramount importance, the senior advocate added, given the distortions of keeping bills pending indefinitely in opposition-ruled states. Sibal said, ""A house cannot run if there is a marital discord. This is also true for the democratic institutions, where there must be harmony between legislature, executive and constitutional heads. ""He said the Constitution mandates the governor to act ""as soon as possible"", which attaches immediacy to the action of the governor. When that is being breached by keeping the bills pending for years without ascribing a reason, the SC would be preventing constitutional distortion by providing a timeline, Sibal said.""Thus, time limits prescribed by constitutional courts under the circumstances above are not to be equated with judicially enacted constitutional amendments,"" Sibal said, and termed the President's queries to the SC as ""vague and based on conjured up situations"" most of which do not warrant the SC's opinion.For Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh, senior advocates Gopal Subamanium and Anand Sharma echoed Sibal's arguments and said in the constitutional scheme for the federal structure of governance in India, the President or the governors are assigned no legislative or executive function.Subramanium said according to Dr B R Ambedkar, the states and Centre are to function as co-equals within their demarcated legislative arenas. ""If the governors, as agents of the Centre acting as titular heads of the states, would have unbridled power to stall bills enacted by state legislatures, then there would be a serious imbalance in the federal governance,"" he said.","West bengal warns that vesting governors with discretion to decide the fate of bills would jeopardise states' legislative functions.

The SOO pact was signed in 2008 and renewed from time to time. However, it has not been renewed since Feb 2024 due to the ethnic strife that Manipur has witnessed for more than two years. Prime Minister Modi is expected to visit Manipur, in what will be his first visit to the state since ethnic violence broke out there in May 2023, on Sept 12 or 13.The Centre's interlocutor team, comprising officials of the Intelligence Bureau and home ministry, held talks with representatives of the Kuki-Zo groups here on Wednesday, with the discussions likely to continue on Thursday. Sources said the talks were positive and the SOO is likely to be renewed as they conclude on Thursday.Sources said the terms of SOO may be tweaked to relocate the Kuki-Zo camps, to which their arms must be confined, and have the remuneration due to Kuki-Zo cadres deposited directly into their individual bank accounts. Earlier, this remuneration was handed over to some leaders who would pass it on to the cadres.The signing of the SOO is also set to have a positive impact on peace efforts in Manipur, in that it may specifically require Kuki-Zo groups to abjure violence and not brandish weapons outside their designated camps. The talks here will also persuade them to allow Meiteis to move freely on National Highway 2.

Government tightens norms on use of scribes by persons with disabilities in competitive exams,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-tightens-norms-on-use-of-scribes-by-persons-with-disabilities-in-competitive-exams/articleshow/123682630.cms,"NEW DELHI: The government has tightened norms on use of scribes in competitive examinations for persons with disabilities (PwDs), making it compulsory for bodies conducting tests linked to employment and admission to professional courses — like IIT-JEE, NEET, CAT and civil services — to create their own scribe pools within two years and phase out the option of candidate’s bringing their “own scribe” to prevent exploitation of the exam process.Going forward examining agencies, such as UPSC, NTA and UGC, have to provide technological aids like software-enabled laptops/desktops, Braille/large print, or recording devices as the first option to PwDs to take the exams. The “own scribe” provision has been allowed as a “last resort” until an examining body’s “pool of scribes” is ready for applicants who do not opt for the use of technology.Moreover, the social justice ministry’s department of empowerment of PwD has allowed the use of scribes by examining bodies only in cases where necessary technological support sought by a candidate is unavailable or in cases where due to the nature of disability there is requirement of a scribe.For instance, in case of PwDs in the category of blindness, locomotor disability (both arms only) and cerebral palsy, the facility of scribe, reader or lab assistant may be given on production of valid disability certificate or UDID card.In the case of all other specified disabilities, the facility will be provided on production of a certificate after medical examination by chief medical officer, civil surgeon or medical superintendent of a govt healthcare institution.These guidelines, in line with recent Supreme Court directives, apply to all candidates, who due to their disability, face functional limitations in writing an examination, irrespective of the nature or extent of their disability. These guidelines will not apply to regular school (board)/college/university academic exams.“The provision of ‘own scribe’ has been identified as a significant vulnerability in maintaining integrity and fairness of the examination process. Instances of malpractice, including collusion between candidates and their privately arranged scribes, have been observed by various examining bodies, where scribes wrote answers independently without adequate dictation, thereby undermining the examination’s credibility,” according to the guidelines.With concerns being raised by a section regarding problems candidates may face during implementation of the guidelines, the department’s secretary Rajesh Aggarwal said, “We are in touch with all stakeholders and it will be ensured that no candidate is adversely impacted.”","The government has tightened norms on use of scribes in competitive examinations for persons with disabilities (pwds) examinations will have to provide technological aids like software-enabled laptops/desktops, braille/large print, or recording devices as the first option.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123682676,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-46088,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
