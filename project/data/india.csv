Bihar assembly elections: Two more parties join Mahagathbandhan; seat sharing deal to get complex?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-assembly-elections-two-more-parties-join-mahagathbandhan-seat-sharing-deal-to-get-complex/articleshow/123756184.cms,"NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing negotiations for upcoming assembly elections in Bihar have become more complex as two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance. The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"". Ridiculing the government for copying his ideas, he said that at present he was moving ahead while the govt was behind him.""Tejashwi aage-aage, Sarkar pichhe-pichhe.

‘Phulera-style governance in Delhi’: AAP hits out at Rekha Gupta; questions husband’s presence in official meetings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/phulera-style-governance-in-delhi-aap-hits-out-at-rekha-gupta-questions-husbands-presence-in-official-meetings/articleshow/123756059.cms,"Delhi CM Rekha Gupta with her husband Manish Gupta (Image: X/Saurabh_MLAgk)

Row Over Attack On Delhi CM Rekha Gupta, BJP Suspects Political Conspiracy By Rivals

NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday hit out at Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta, comparing her administration to the popular web series Panchayat. It alleged that the CM’s husband, Manish Gupta was being allowed to play an active role in government functioning.The party said the situation resembled the series, where the elected sarpanch serves largely as a figurehead while administrative work is handled by her husband.In a post on X, AAP questioned, “Is the government of Phulera's Panchayat currently running in Delhi?”AAP leader and former health minister Saurabh Bhardwaj also launched a scathing attack on Delhi CM.In a post on X, he said: ""Just as in Phulera's panchayat, where the woman sarpanch's husband acted as the sarpanch, today in Delhi, the CM's husband is sitting in official meetings.""Bhardwaj said the move was completely unconstitutional, adding that in the nation’s capital both democracy and the constitutional system were being mocked. He accused the BJP of indulging in the very dynastic politics for which it frequently criticises the Congress.“This is completely unconstitutional. In the nation’s capital, democracy and the constitutional system are being mocked. The BJP, which often attacks the Congress over dynastic politics, must answer whether this is not the same,” Bhardwaj wrote.He further questioned why a family member was being given such authority, asking: “Does the CM of the world’s largest party have no worker left whom she can trust? What is that work which only a family member can do?”The AAP leader asked what the reasons were for the chief minister to establish her husband’s authority. He further questioned why her husband was being made a part of the government’s administrative system in this way.He also posted photographs showing her husband seated beside the chief minister in official meetings.The criticism comes after photos of Manish Gupta attending official meetings appeared both on Rekha Gupta’s personal Instagram account and the official handle of the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO).The controversy has evoked comparisons with Panchayat, a web series by TVF on Amazon Prime set in the fictional village of Phulera, Uttar Pradesh.The show depicts Manju Devi (played by Neena Gupta) as the elected sarpanch, but it is her husband Brij Bhushan Dubey (played by Raghubir Yadav) who effectively handles all administrative responsibilities.","The aam aadmi party (aap) on sunday hit out at delhi chief minister rekha gupta.

This is the paradox at the heart of Dasa Mahavidya: Gesture, Form and the Feminine Divine, an exhibition that brings together the works of Krishnanand Jha (1947-2018) and Santosh Kumar Das. For centuries, the brush in Mithila painting has been held by women, who inscribed devotion, memory, and ritual on the walls of their homes. When men entered this tradition, they unsettled its gendered inheritance, creating both friction and possibility.At the centre of the exhibition are the Dasa Mahavidya - the ten wisdom goddesses of tantra. These are not singular but plural, not reducible to one form but manifold embodiments of feminine power. Kali, the devourer of time; Tara, the guide across danger; Tripur Sundari, beauty incarnate; Bhuvaneshvari, mistress of the worlds; Bhairavi, the fierce one; Chinnamasta, the self-decapitated; Dhumavati, the smoky crone; Baglamukhi, the stunner of foes; Matangi, the outcaste musician; and Kamla, the lotus goddess of prosperity. These goddesses are believed to be manifestations of Goddess Parvati and are invoked for spiritual growth, empowerment, and the realisation of the Supreme through practices like meditation, mantra chanting and devotional acts.Collectively, they represent what tantra insists upon: the feminine is not simply nurturing or benevolent but also terrifying, paradoxical, and boundless. She is creation and destruction, order and chaos, beauty and horror. To depict the Mahavidya is therefore not an ornamental act but a spiritual confrontation. For Krishnanand Jha, painting the goddess was both natural and radical. Born into a family of tantric priests at Harinagar, Madhubani, in Mithila, he was expected to continue priestly duties. Instead, he turned towards painting, making the sacred visible in a form traditionally reserved for women. Jha's priestly inheritance gave him a unique authority to approach tantric subjects with an insider's vision. His goddess of choice was often Chinnamasta, his family's tutelary deity the goddess who severs her own head and drinks her blood even as she nourishes others. In her, Jha found the paradox of power and surrender, destruction and life-force. In his compositions, the goddess is rarely still. She gestures, glances, and propels the viewer forward, as though the act of seeing becomes a ritual procession.Where Jha's goddesses are in motion, Santosh Kumar Das' goddesses stand firm. His Mahavidya are symmetrical, frontal, and commanding. Their stillness radiates a meditative energy, like yantras rendered in living form. Das's trajectory is equally layered. His Dasa Mahavidya is an act of renewal. Each goddess is rendered with meticulous patterning, balanced symmetry, and a quiet but potent force. While deeply traditional, his paintings also converse with contemporary questions about identity, violence, ecology, and devotion.In tantra, ritual authority has historically belonged to men, while in Mithila painting, aesthetic authority has long rested with women. When male artists like Krishnanand Jha and Santosh Kumar Das depict the Dasa Mahavidya, they stand at this interesting crossroads: inheritors of a male-dominated tantric tradition and entrants into a women's visual domain. Is this then a consolidation of male authority, tantric legitimacy grafted onto a female-authored art form or something more porous? Interestingly, several women painters, too, have painted the Mahavidya, thereby stepping into a ritual terrain usually closed to them. In this shared, unsettled space, neither gender holds uncontested power; the only true possessor of the field is the goddess herself - the feminine, who here is not muse but master.('Dasa Mahavidya: Gesture, Form and the Feminine Divine' is on display till Sept 21 at Ojas Art Gallery, Mehrauli)","Dasa mahavidya: gesture, form and the feminine divine brings together works of krishnanand jha and santosh kumar das.

PATIALA: AAP MLA Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra has allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.According to Punjab Police sources, Pathanmajra and his accomplices fired at police officers during the escape and even ran over one personnel, leaving him injured.According to reports, Pathanmajra and his accomplices ran over police personnel with an SUV.The Sanour MLA was arrested a day after publicly criticising his party’s Delhi leadership.His detention in Patiala was linked to a rape case filed against him, sparking political uproar in the region.In a social media post, Pathanmajra claimed the case related to his former wife and alleged that the fresh charges of rape were politically motivated.“I was booked because I raised my voice against my own government, especially the Delhi leadership,” he wrote.His brother, Hardev Singh, said the MLA was taken into custody under Section 376 of the IPC despite already having been granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. “He was arrested from Dabri in Haryana in a case where bail was already granted. This is clearly an attempt to silence him,” he alleged.CIA Patiala confirmed that three weapons have been recovered and one accomplice of MLA Pathanmajra has been arrested.The arrested individual has been identified as Balwinder Singh, while the search for MLA Pathanmajra continues.Police said two officers were injured when stones were thrown at them during the MLA’s escape attempt.Authorities added that supporters of the MLA not only pelted stones but also opened fire at the police team.Before his arrest, Pathanmajra had appealed to colleagues and supporters via Facebook to protest outside the Patiala SSP’s office at the Mini Secretariat. He urged people to reach “in tractors, trolleys, and cars” to demand his release. “I will not be silenced even if more cases are registered against me. Will AAP’s Delhi leadership rule Punjabis now? Even Congress and BJP did not interfere to this extent,” he said.The MLA has repeatedly accused the party’s central leadership of sidelining Punjab leaders and “remote-controlling” the state. Recently, he criticised officials of the Irrigation Department over flood relief efforts in his constituency. Soon after, his security cover was withdrawn and police officers in the area were reshuffled — moves that raised eyebrows.“This is retaliation. They looted Punjab more than Abdali. Now they want to sell Punjab,” Pathanmajra declared.","Harmeet singh pathanmajra allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station.

MUMBAI: In one of the biggest drug seizures in the country this year, the Anti-Narcotics Cell and Crime Branch of the Mira-Bhayandar, Vasai-Virar police have busted a massive cartel operating through a chemical manufacturing factory in Telangana, seizing mephedrone (MD) worth an estimated Rs 12,000 crore.Mephedrone, also called “meow meow,” “meph,” “m-cat,” and “miaow,” is a synthetic stimulant belonging to the amphetamine group of drugs, which includes speed and ecstasy. According to sources, this is among the largest narcotics seizures in recent years.The probe began with the arrest of a 12 person including a foreign national and seizure of 100 grams of MD along with Rs 25 lakh in cash. Further interrogation revealed links to an interstate network engaged in large-scale production and supply of mephedrone. The investigation eventually led officers to Telangana, where the cartel was using a chemical factory as a cover for drug manufacturing.“In a bid to get to the roots of the factory, we infiltrated our men in the gang. After weeks of risky efforts, we were able to bust the cartel,” a senior officer said.The factory, located in the Cherlapally industrial area near Hyderabad and operating under the name Waghdevi Labs, appeared legitimate from the outside but was allegedly producing narcotics on a large scale.During the raid, police seized sophisticated chemical equipment, drug production units, and a massive cache of raw materials, including nearly 32,000 litres of precursor chemicals.The factory’s owner and chemical expert, Srinivas Valotty, along with associate Tanaji Pate, were taken into custody. In total, 12 persons have been arrested so far, including the foreign national caught in the initial operation.Police described the bust as a major blow to the narcotics supply chain across Maharashtra and other states. The factory has been sealed, and further raids are being conducted to trace the cartel’s wider distribution network.Commissioner of MBVV Niket Kaushik confirmed the drug seizure and said their investigation has led them to drug cartel to other states.","Mephedrone is a synthetic stimulant belonging to the amphetamine group of drugs, which includes speed and ecstasy.

VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Friday directed that health officials take a serious note on continuous deaths in Turakapalem of Guntur district and declare a health emergency in the village. He ordered that all the people suffering with unexplained illness should be admitted to hospital.Naidu conducted a review meeting on death of around 20 people in Turakapalem village in the past two months with unknown disease. He said health camps should be conducted in the village on Saturday and Sunday and medical tests should be conducted to all and prepare health profile of everyone.He advised the health officials to take the assistance of AIIMS Mangalagiri and if necessary international medical experts. He directed the officials to supply protected drinking water in the village. He made it clear no new case should be reported hereafter.""Officials should be vigilant 24X7 as there is a high possibility for the spread of the suspected bacterial disease through drinking water, food items, and through air.Meanwhile, the state govt constituted a high-level committee, led by Director of Secondary Health (DSH) Dr A Siri, to identify the officials responsible for failing to apprise higher authorities in time about the sudden spike in deaths in Turakapalem village.The committee will also make recommendations on measures to ensure that health department officials are immediately informed in case of a large number of deaths due to any illness in any region of the state in the future. This was announced by Health Minister Y Satya Kumar Yadav on Friday during his visit to Turakapalem village.Stating that stern action would be taken against all those officials for their inaction in reporting the deaths to the health authorities, Satya Kumar Yadav warned that no official will be spared and appropriate action will be taken against all the officials once the probe report is submitted by the high-level committee, which was ordered to complete in a week's time.Speaking to reporters, Satya Kumar Yadav said it is unfortunate on the part of the healthcare personnel working at the field level that they did not apprise the higher officials despite 23 people dying in the past two months. He said that the mean age of the deceased is 55, while around seven deceased were aged above 70 years.Dismissing media reports linking Melioidosis as the reason behind the deaths, the health minister said that the blood test reports have not confirmed the Melioidosis bacteria and that chemical and biological tests are also being done to determine the exact cause.The minister toured Turakapalem village, visiting the victims' households, enquiring about their health condition, and consoling the bereaved family members, besides taking a first-hand review of the medical services being provided to the villagers at the special medical camp set up in the village.Meanwhile, Guntur DMHO Dr Vijaya Lakshmi informed that the blood culture test results of the blood samples collected from individuals showing fever symptoms will arrive on Saturday.",Chief minister n chandrababu naidu on friday directed that health officials take a serious note on continuous deaths in turakapalem of guntur district.

BHUBANESWAR: Police on Sunday served a notice to the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF), seeking details of its financial records and foreign contributions, in connection with a case registered earlier this year in Jharsuguda against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his alleged “anti-national” remarks.Police said notice has been issued under section 94 of BNSS. The foundation director has been summoned by the police as well. Police have sought a range of documents, including year-wise foreign contributions since the foundation’s inception in 1991, details of bank accounts, authorized signatories, names and contacts of auditors, a copy of the FCRA license, and clarifications on specific donations.Jharsuguda police have specifically asked the foundation if it has brought foreign donations from controversial preacher Zakir Naik and the Chinese government.Additionally, an explanation has been sought regarding the alleged diversion of the PM relief fund during the UPA era. “Failure to comply with the notice could result in penal action under Section 210 of the BNSS,” a police officer said.An FIR had been lodged on February 7 against Gandhi in Jharsuguda after his speech at the inauguration of the new Congress headquarters in Delhi on January 15, where he accused the BJP and RSS of capturing national institutions and stated, “We are now fighting the BJP, the RSS, and the Indian State itself”.The complaint was filed by local BJP units and allied organizations, alleging that Gandhi's remarks incited subversive activities and undermined India's sovereignty.Inspector General (Northern Range) Himanshu Lal said, “Police are well within their scope to investigate the case. The case is progressing well”.This case is notable as it is one of the first high-profile cases under the BNSS, which replaced the Indian Penal Code in July 2024, marking a significant shift in legal proceedings related to national security and public order.","Odisha cops serve notice to rajiv foundation seeking foreign contribution details.

50 held over Hazratbal shrine emblem row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/50-held-over-hazratbal-shrine-emblem-row/articleshow/123751213.cms,"SRINAGAR: Nearly 50 people have been detained for questioning over the defacing of a plaque bearing the national emblem inside Hazratbal shrine in Srinagar, PTI said Sunday, while National Conference (NC) put the figure at 30 and BJP’s Altaf Thakur said 26. J&K police have not confirmed any numbers since the vandalism Friday afternoon.“No one has been formally arrested so far, but some people are being questioned,” PTI quoted a senior police officer as saying, adding that women allegedly involved will face legal action but minors will not be proceeded against.Authorities tightened security around the shrine, which houses a relic of Prophet Muhammad, after the plaque was vandalised and removed following Friday prayers. Police had checked phone videos and CCTV footage before picking up dozens. No fresh disturbances have been reported.NC said an open FIR was registered and accused the LG-led administration of heavy-handedness. “I’m deeply anguished to learn that nearly 30 people have been detained by police,” NC MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi said, calling the detentions “operational retribution” and warning against misrepresenting “an expression of collective hurt as anti-national”.He urged release of detainees and said the idea of India rests on respect for religious sentiment.NC president Farooq Abdullah called the installation of the Ashoka emblem a mistake. “There was no need to install the plaque. They put it up and people did not like it. When the Hazratbal shrine was constructed no board was placed there because it was dedicated to Allah and His Prophet,” he said. “We are peace-loving people and this shouldn’t have been done.”CM Omar Abdullah said Waqf Board should apologise, contending that the national emblem is for govt offices, not mosques.PDP, CPM and Peoples Conference demanded action against Waqf Board chairperson Darakhshan Andrabi, a BJP appointee, who had overseen the plaque’s placement Thursday as part of what she described as remodelling on Turkish lines.Opposition politicians called the plaque “provocative” and “blasphemous”, saying symbols are forbidden inside mosques. BJP said the defacement was an attempt to revive terrorism and separatism in J&K.BJP defended Andrabi’s role and alleged NC was exploiting the controversy. “This is an act of terrorism. Andrabi had every right to place the emblem. NC doesn’t like her and is using the emblem to create unrest in Kashmir Valley,” party spokesperson Altaf Thakur said.Andrabi demanded those who vandalised the plaque be booked under Public Safety Act.",Nearly 50 people detained for questioning over the defacing of a plaque bearing the national emblem inside hazratbal shrine in srinagar.

NEW DELHI: The JDS slammed Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge for his interaction with a farmer, where he drove him away, dismissing his grievances, saying that he suffered more crop damage than the farmer. JDS accused Kharge of mocking the farmer and claimed that for the Congress, farmers are only a matter of speeches and manifestos.""Mr Kharge, after decades in politics, holding powerful posts, becoming @INCIndia’s national president, having your son@PriyankKharge as a minister, and your party ruling the state, you still don’t have the patience to listen to farmers in your own district?

""How many acres did you plant?"" Kharge was seen saying in the clip.""4 acres? I planted in 40 acres and mine has been damaged worse than this,"" Kharge said. ""This is like the saying that one who has delivered three kids comes to a person who has delivered 6 and talks about the struggle,"" Kharge said adding that he was aware of the crop loss issue.""Don't come here just for the sake of publicity, I am aware of this issue, I am aware of the crop losses this year.

NEW DELHI: At an age when many women are busy caring for their grandchildren, a 55-year-old from Rajasthan’s Udaipur district has just welcomed her 17th child.The birth at the Community Health Centre in Jhadol block has turned Lilavas village into a talking point. Relatives, neighbours and villagers crowded the hospital to see Rekha, amused at the unusual sight of grandchildren greeting their new baby aunt, PTI reported.Rekha, married to scrap dealer Kavara Ram Kalbelia, has given birth 17 times over the years. Five of those children – four sons and one daughter – died soon after birth, leaving the couple with 12 surviving kids: seven boys and five girls.Their household spans three generations under one roof. ""Two of my sons and three of my daughters are married. Each of them has two or three children,"" Kavara said, his voice carrying both pride and weariness.This means while Rekha tends to her newborn, she is simultaneously grandmother to several toddlers.Behind the curiosity, however, lies hardship. Kavara makes a meagre living by selling scrap and admits to taking high-interest loans to pay for his children’s weddings. “No member of the family has ever gone to school,” he said, highlighting how poverty continues to dominate their lives.Doctors at the Jhadol centre described the delivery as a challenge. Rekha initially told them it was only her fourth pregnancy. Block CMHO Dr Dharmendra noted that the case reflects the difficulties in tribal-dominated areas, where lack of education and awareness often fuel such situations.“This is a nomadic family that keeps moving. Eleven surviving children were found with them. We will work to link them with government schemes and provide support,” he said.Gynaecologist Dr. Roshan Darangi, who handled the delivery, confirmed the truth later: “It turned out to be her 17th childbirth. Now, we will counsel her for sterilisation.”Another doctor, Mukesh Garasiya, added that Rekha had been admitted on August 24 without sonography or pre-delivery tests. “She could have died from excessive bleeding. With so many deliveries, the uterus weakens and the risk of haemorrhage rises. Thankfully, this time, everything went smoothly,” he explained.","Rekha ram kalbelia, 55, from rajasthan's udaipur district has just welcomed her 17th child.

'Let's reiterate commitment to spread Bhupen Da's message',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lets-reiterate-commitment-to-spread-bhupen-das-message/articleshow/123755138.cms,"Today, 8th September, is a very special day for all those who are passionate about Indian culture and music. It is particularly more special for my sisters and brothers of Assam. After all, it is the birth anniversary of Bhupen Hazarika, one of the most extraordinary voices India has ever known. As you are all aware, this year marks the beginning of his birth centenary celebrations. It is an occasion to revisit his monumental contributions to Indian artistic expression and public consciousness.What Bhupen Da gave us extends far beyond music. His works embodied emotions that transcended melody. More than just a voice, he was the heartbeat of the people. Generations have grown up listening to his songs, each word resonating with themes of kindness, social justice, unity and deep-rooted belonging.From Assam emerged a voice that flowed like a timeless river, crossing borders and cultures, carrying with it the spirit of humanity. Bhupen Da travelled the globe, rubbed shoulders with the who's who across all spectrums of society, but he remained deeply connected to his roots in Assam. The rich oral traditions, folk melodies and community storytelling practices of Assam deeply shaped his early childhood. These experiences formed the bedrock of his artistic vocabulary.He always carried the spirit of Assam's indigenous identity and the ethos of its people.Brilliance came to Bhupen Da at a very young age. At the age of just five, he sang at a public event and quickly caught the attention of none other than Lakshminath Bezbaruah, the pioneering figure of Assamese literature. By the time he was a teenager, he had recorded his first song. But music was only one part of his personality. Bhupen Da was as much an intellectual at heart... curious, articulate and driven by an insatiable desire to understand the world. Cultural legends like Jyoti Prasad Agarwala and Bishnu Prasad Rabha left a deep impression on his mind and also deepened his spirit of enquiry. It was also this desire to learn that made him excel at Cotton College, Banaras Hindu University and took him to the United States, where he interacted with leading academics, thinkers and musicians of those times. He met Paul Robeson, the legendary artist and civil rights leader. Robeson's song ""Ol' Man River"" became the inspiration for Bhupen Da's iconic composition 'Bistirno Parore.' The much-admired former American First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt awarded him a Gold Medal for his performances of Indian folk music.Bhupen Da had the option of remaining in the US, but he returned to India and immersed himself in music. From radio to theatre, films to educational documentaries, he was well-versed in each of these media. Wherever he went, he emphasised supporting young talent. His works combined lyrical flair and also gave social messages, touching upon justice for the poor, rural development, strength of common citizens, to name a few. Through his music, he gave voice to the aspirations of boatmen, tea garden workers, women, farmers, etc. In addition to being nostalgic, Bhupen Da's works also became a powerful lens to view modernity. A lot of people, especially from the socially backward classes like him, derived strength and hope from his music.The spirit of 'Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat' found powerful expression in Bhupen Hazarika's life journey. His works transcended linguistic and regional boundaries to unite people across the country. He composed for films in Assamese, Bengali and Hindi. He made Assam visible and audible to the rest of India. It is no exaggeration to say that he helped shape the cultural identity of modern Assam, both for those within the state and for the Assamese diaspora across the globe.Bhupen Da, although not really a political person, did remain connected to the world of public service as well. In 1967, he was elected as an independent MLA from Nauboicha constituency in Assam, demonstrating how deeply his public persona was rooted in the people's trust. Though he never became a career politician, his passion for serving others was highly impactful.The people and Government of India have recognised his enormous contributions over the years. He was conferred with several awards, including the Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan, Padma Vibhushan, Dadasaheb Phalke Award and more. In 2019, it was an honour for me personally and for the NDA government that the Bharat Ratna was conferred upon him during our tenure. People from across the world, especially those from Assam and the Northeast, expressed joy that this honour was conferred upon him. This honour celebrated the principles that Bhupen Da held dear to his heart - that music, when grounded in truth, can transcend all barriers. That a song can carry the weight of a people's dreams and move hearts across the world.I remember the time Bhupen Da passed away in 2011. I had seen on television how lakhs of people attended his funeral. Every eye was moist that time. Even in death, like in his illustrious life, he brought people together. It was thus fitting that he was cremated at the Jalukbari hillock overlooking the Brahmaputra, the very river that had been the lifeline of his music, metaphors and memories. It is gladdening that the Assam Government has supported the work of the Bhupen Hazarika Cultural Trust, which is working to popularise his life journey among youngsters.Bhupen Hazarika's life teaches us the power of empathy, of listening to people and of staying rooted. His songs continue to be sung by young and old alike. His music teaches us to be compassionate and courageous. It asks us to remember our rivers, our labourers, our tea workers, our Nari Shakti and our Yuva Shakti. It encourages us to believe in unity in diversity.Bharat is blessed to have Bhupen Hazarika. As we celebrate the beginning of his centenary year, let us reiterate our commitment to spreading his message far and wide. May it also inspire us to keep working to support music, art and culture, to encourage young talent and make India a nurturing ground for creativity and artistic excellence.It is only fitting that one of India's most significant infrastructure projects, the bridge connecting Dhola and Sadiya, bears the name of Bhupen Hazarika. Just as his songs connected hearts across regions, this bridge connects lands and people.The author is the Prime Minister of India",Bhupen hazarika was one of the most extraordinary voices india has ever known. He always carried the spirit of assam's indigenous identity and ethos of its people. His works transcended linguistic and regional boundaries to unite people across the country. Bhupen hazarika's songs continue to be sung by young and old alike.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123755259,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-20702,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
