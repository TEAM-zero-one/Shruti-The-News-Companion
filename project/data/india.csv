Sonia Gandhi Targets Modi Govt On ASHA, Anganwadi Workers In Rajya Sabha

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Sonia Gandhi Saturday described as ""politically motivated and frivolous"" a criminal revision petition before a Delhi court against a 2025 magisterial order that declined to order an FIR over alleged inclusion of her name in electoral rolls in 1980, three years before she acquired Indian citizenship.The petition before special judge Vishal Gogne of Rouse Avenue sessions court alleges that the Italian origin Sonia's name was added using forged documents. The Congress senior described the claims as ""wholly misconceived"" and the plea as ""abuse of the process of law"".The plea was filed by one Vikas Tripathi, challenging magistrate Vaibhav Chaurasiya's refusal on Sept 11 last year to order the FIR. Sonia had been sent notices on Dec 9, 2025, over the plea. Judge Gogne noted the reply on Saturday and listed the matter for arguments on Feb 21.In her reply, Sonia said the trial (magistrate) court had rightly held that issues of citizenship fall ""exclusively within the domain of the Central govt"", while electoral roll disputes are ""vested solely with Election Commission of India "". She argued that criminal courts cannot entertain private complaints disguised as IPC or BNS offences, as this would violate the doctrine of separation of powers and Article 329 of the Constitution, which bars judicial interference in the electoral process.Sonia added that a ""controversy raised in the media more than 25 years back"" was being recycled to file the revision plea, with allegations that were ""speculative and unsupported"" by authentic documents, and which failed to specify the documents allegedly forged or their source.Although the plea claims Sonia's name was ""re-entered"" in electoral rolls with a qualifying date of Jan 1, 1983, no supporting document was placed on record. ""It is incomprehensible on what basis it has been claimed that the respondent got her name re-entered,"" the reply states.","The petition alleges that the italian origin sonia's name was added using forged documents.

From Tamil Pride To Global Trust: How PM Modi Used Culture To Reset India-Malaysia Relations

KUALA LUMPUR/NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Saturday chose an Indian community event in Kuala Lumpur to shower praise on Tamil culture and highlight the presence of several Tamilians in key positions in India. The focus on Tamilians was, though, very much in order as they make up an overwhelming majority of people of Indian origins in Malaysia.Tamil literature is eternal and its culture global, he emphasised, noting that Malaysia is home to the second largest population of Indian-origin community in the world.In India, he said, Vice-President C P Radhakrishnan is a Tamilian and so are key members of his govt, EAM S Jaishankar and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. A junior minister L Murugan is from Tamil Nadu as well, he added.Though he has often voiced his admiration for Tamil language and culture, his generous praise at the event in Kuala Lumpur had political significance as well, as Tamil Nadu is headed for the assembly polls.At the 'Selamat Datang Modi Ji (welcome Modi)' event, Modi recalled that when he first visited Malaysia in 2015, India was in the 11th spot of the economic ladder and today, a decade later, in the top three.""With the world's largest digital public infrastructure propelling country's economy, creating third largest start-up hub in the world, the country is ensuring clean and green growth,"" he added, announcing that ""UPI would be available in Malaysia very soon. ""He announced India's decision to open its first consulate in Malaysia to strengthen ongoing cooperation between India and Malaysia and expand outreach to the Indian community in Malaysia.He said Tamil is India's gift to the world. Noting that Tamil diaspora has been present in Malaysia for many centuries, he said inspired by its history, India had established the Thiruvalluvar Chair at the University of Malaya and would now set up a Thiruvalluvar Centre to further strengthen shared heritage.The Prime Minister praised his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim for the warm welcome accorded to him and said it emphasised his love and respect for India and the Indian community. Anwar who was present at the meeting had called Modi ""a great friend"".","Pm narendra modi chose an indian community event in kuala lumpur to shower praise on tamil culture and highlight the presence of several tamilians in key positions in india.

GHAZIABAD: As police intensify their investigation into the deaths of three sisters in Ghaziabad, their father, Chetan Kumar, has acknowledged being under financial stress but denied that it played any role in the alleged suicides.“I had a loan of Rs 30 lakh, but this was not the reason behind my three daughters’ death.

One can understand if someone takes such an extreme step owing to depression. But how could all three sisters do this together?"" said Isha Tyagi, a resident of the society.Investigators said the girls’ father, Chetan Kumar, had married twice and had five children — four daughters and a son. Both wives are sisters, according to news agency PTI, and the entire family lived together.She said she had rarely seen the girls interacting with other children. According to her, they were never seen going to school or playing in the society park, and their isolation had gone largely unnoticed for years.Police said preliminary findings suggest the sisters were heavily influenced by Korean content, particularly a Korean game, and spent a substantial amount of time on their mobile phones.Deputy commissioner of police Nimish Patil said the girls’ schooling had been irregular and their academic performance below average. “But it is evident that the girls were highly addicted to mobile phone usage,” he said.Neighbours said the family had lived in the society for about three years but mostly kept to themselves.Rahul Kumar Jha, the joint secretary of the residential society, said he had occasionally seen the girls attending tuition classes but was unaware of their formal schooling.Also read: Inside the troubled Ghaziabad home: Two marriages, wives leaving, no schooling for kids, mounting debts and a family under strain “They spent most of their time confined to a single room.

Some read: “make me a heart broken”, “I am very very alone” and “my life is very very alone”, police said.Jyoti Kasana, another resident, said children of that age were particularly vulnerable. “Children at this age are vulnerable. Even sudden actions like taking away a phone or tablet can deeply affect their mental state,” she said.Ajay Kasana, vice-president of the society, said the girls had not been attending school since the pandemic.Police also recovered a note believed to have been left by the sisters. It read: “Read everything written in this diary, it is all here ” and included a crying face emoji, followed by a handwritten message: “Sorry papa, I am really sorry.”Authorities said the investigation is ongoing and statements from residents are being recorded.","'sorry papa': suicide note from three sisters in ghaziabad triggers debate on gaming addiction.

Government has spent just a little more than 40% of the budgeted amount in its biggest schemes in the first three quarters of the current fiscal and expects to spend less than 75% by the end of the year. These 53 selected schemes are those that had a budget estimate of Rs 500 crore or more in 2025-26.These schemes to be implemented by states are funded by both Centre and states, in accordance with the approved sharing pattern.Infrastructure maintenance schemes under health and family welfare, Indira Gandhi National Widow Pension Scheme, and pre-matric scholarship for SCs and others were the only three schemes in which the revised estimate (RE) was equal to the budgeted amount. RE was more than 100% of the budget estimate (BE) for three others - Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, post-matric scholarship for STs, and National Mission on Natural Farming.For the remaining 47 sche-mes, RE is lower than BE by varying degrees. The most dr-astic decline is in PM Krishi Sinchayee Yojana where RE of Rs 150 crore is barely a sixth of the BE of Rs 850 crore.Overall, BEs for these 53 schemes were just over Rs 5 lakh crore, revised to under Rs 3.8 lakh crore, or 74.4% of the budgetary allocation.The funds released in the nine months ending Dec 31 totalled just over Rs 2 lakh crore or 41.2% of the budget allocation and 55.4% of REs.REs are less than 40% of BE for PMKSY-Command Area Development and Water Management, PM eBus Sewa, Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan, Jal Jeevan Mission/National Rural Drinking Water Mission, Computerization of Primary Agricultural Credit Societies and Other Items of State/UT Component-PMAY Urban.The actual amount released is less than 10% of BE in six of these schemes.Among the larger of these schemes (Rs 2,000 crore or more BE) are Jal Jeevan Mission/National Rural Drinking Water Mission (BE Rs 67,000 crore, actual spend in nine months RE Rs 31 crore), PM Schools for Rising India (BE Rs 7,500 crore, actual spend Rs 473 crore), and Pradhan Mantri Anusuchit Jaati Abhyuday Yojana (BE Rs 2,140 crore, actual spend Rs 40 crore).",Government has spent just a little more than 40% of the budgeted amount in its biggest schemes.

“Democracy Sliding Into ICU”: Opposition Targets BJP As BMC Polls Trigger Political Storm

NEW DELHI: BJP corporator Ritu Tawde is set to become Mumbai’s next mayor after being elected unopposed, marking the party’s return to the post after 44 years and ending the Shiv Sena’s uninterrupted 25-year hold over the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).The contest turned uncontested after the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT) decided not to field a challenger against Tawde, effectively clearing her path to the mayor’s office. Though the mayor’s role is largely ceremonial, it carries strong political and symbolic significance in Mumbai’s identity-driven civic politics.Tawde’s elevation will be the BJP’s first mayoral win in Mumbai since Prabhakar Pai’s tenure in 1982–83. It also means the undivided Shiv Sena, which controlled the BMC from 1997 to 2022, will not hold the mayor’s post after nearly three decades.On the final day of nominations, the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, a BJP ally in the ruling Mahayuti, nominated Sanjay Ghadi as its candidate for deputy mayor. The party announced that the deputy mayor’s tenure would be split, allowing multiple corporators to serve during the term.A senior BMC official told PTI that only one nomination each was received for the mayor’s and deputy mayor’s posts before the 6 pm deadline. “We have received just one nomination from BJP’s Ritu Tawde for the mayor’s post and another from Sanjay Ghadi for the deputy mayor’s post,” the official said.Although opposition parties have not filed nominations, the election process will be formally completed on February 11, which is also the last day for withdrawal of nominations. The mayor’s post has been reserved for a woman candidate from the open category following a draw of lots by the Urban Development Department.Tawde (53), a corporator from Ghatkopar East, filed her nomination at the municipal secretary’s office in the presence of senior Mahayuti leaders, including minister Mangal Prabhat Lodha and BJP Mumbai unit chief Ameet Satam.Speaking to reporters, she said a safer and more developed Mumbai was her priority and that she wanted to work for citizens of the cosmopolitan city.The Shiv Sena (UBT) was expected to challenge the BJP nominee but decided against it after a meeting at party chief Uddhav Thackeray’s residence. Former Mumbai mayor and Sena (UBT) leader Kishori Pednekar said the decision reflected respect for Marathi identity.“The BJP had to accept that Marathi manoos is a Hindu. If the mayor of Mumbai is Marathi manoos, we won’t do anything that amounts to a bad omen. We have accepted the arithmetic and will play the role of a strong opposition and fight for Mumbai,” Pednekar said.The Sena (UBT) had raised the Marathi identity plank in last month’s BMC elections, where it contested in alliance with the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS). The BJP emerged as the single largest party with 89 seats in the 227-member civic body. The ruling Mahayuti alliance, with a combined strength of 118 corporators, comfortably crossed the halfway mark of 114.Addressing a press conference earlier in the day, BJP’s Satam said that the city was set to get a BJP mayor after four decades. “We have the backing of 118 corporators and the support of more members. The Mahayuti will work to free the BMC from the clutches of corruption,” he said.Satam also said that the alliance had asserted from the beginning that Mumbai’s mayor would be Marathi and Hindu. “The city will now get a Marathi, Malvani, Konkani and Hindu mayor,” he added.Reacting sharply, the NCP (SP) criticised the BJP’s choice, saying selecting a former Congress leader as mayor had demoralised party loyalists. NCP (SP) spokesperson Clyde Crasto said, “By choosing a former Congresswoman as mayor, the BJP has insulted its own loyal corporators who have given their blood, sweat and tears for the party.”Tawde, who joined the BJP in 2012 after quitting the Congress, was elected as a corporator the same year. During her first term, she chaired the BMC’s Education Committee and raised issues related to infrastructure, water supply and public safety. She was also in the spotlight for raising objections to mannequins displaying objectionable clothing in shops.Ghadi, a corporator from Ward No. 5 who defected from Sena (UBT) to the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, will serve as deputy mayor for 15 months, party secretary Sanjay More said.The BMC, India’s richest civic body, has been under a state-appointed administrator since March 2022 following the end of the previous term. Its budget for 2025–26 stands at Rs 74,450 crore, higher than that of several Indian states.",Bjp corporator ritu tawde is set to become mumbai’s next mayor after being elected unopposed.

"BJP mocks NC’s ‘special status’ call for J&K, says no return of Article 370",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-mocks-ncs-special-status-call-for-jk-says-no-return-of-article-370/articleshow/128046244.cms,"'Whole Of Jammu And Kashmir Should Be Reunited With India': British MP Bob Blackman

JAMMU: Governing National Conference’s (NC) insistence on restoration of J&K’s “special status” since forming the govt in 2024 drew on Saturday a sharp counter from BJP, which argued that there is no such term in the Indian Constitution while dismissing the call as “no status”.“Show me where the words ‘special status’ are written for J&K in the Indian Constitution. If they can find it, I am ready to face any punishment,” leader of opposition, BJP’s Sunil Sharma, said in the assembly.The dare came in response to NC legislator Javid Hassan Baig’s demand for special status while speaking on Friday’s budget presented by CM Omar Abdullah . Baig contended that the term was enshrined in Article 370 , which defined the constitutional relationship between the erstwhile J&K state and the Indian Union.Baig said Article 35A, which flowed from Article 370, was even more important as it safeguarded land rights and govt jobs for J&K’s people. He further argued that J&K’s Constitution existed under the Constitution of India, granting the region internal autonomy, while external sovereignty had been surrendered to the Union.Article 370, Article 35A, the J&K Constitution and J&K state flag, taken together, constituted what was known as “special status” and it is this NC wanted restored, Baig explained.Sharma countered saying NC’s demand must be backed by an explicit constitutional term while asserting that “Article 370 has been buried”. “What is special status? Where is it mentioned? It is mentioned nowhere. Many states seek special packages and incentives, which can include employment or development packages. They can be called special status,” Sharma said.Outside the assembly, Sharma reiterated that there is no reference to “special status” in the context of J&K’s accession or merger with India and accused NC of misleading voters.On Nov 6, 2024, soon after NC was voted to office, the assembly passed a resolution seeking restoration of “special status” but did not spell out what it meant by the term. In May last year, a key NC meeting chaired by president Farooq Abdullah adopted a resolution for restoration of special status and full J&K statehood. That resolution, too, stopped short of defining the phrase.Former CM Mehbooba Mufi’s PDP and Sajad Lone’s Peoples Conference (PC) have earlier asked NC to clarify its position.","National conference's insistence on restoration of j&k's ""special status"" drew sharp counter from bjp.

Supreme Court Stays Its Order On Aravalli Definition, Environment Minister Welcomes Move

An evolving movement

In the heat of Rajasthan ’s desert districts, a tree has become the focal point of a widening confrontation. Markets have shut, saints have gone on strike, political rivals have shared protest stages, and thousands have gathered under open skies to demand its protection.What began in Bikaner as a local objection to the alleged felling of khejri trees for solar power projects has since evolved into the ‘Khejri Bachao Andolan’, a statewide campaign pressing for stricter legal safeguards and an immediate ban on cutting the species.The movement has drawn support across party lines, producing a rare moment of political convergence.The khejri, botanically known asand recognised as Rajasthan’s state tree, occupies a distinctive place in the ecology of the Thar desert.Amid the ongoing protests, chief minister Bhajan Lal Sharma, assuring the protection of the khejri, termed the tree as the state’s “” a wish-fulfilling tree in Indian tradition.In an arid landscape where survival is closely tied to ecology, the reference reaffirms the tree’s symbolic and practical importance. For many communities in western Rajasthan, the debate now extends beyond development policy into questions of history, identity and survival.The present phase of the movement intensified in early February, when over 360 saints and local residents began a hunger strike in Bikaner, demanding an immediate ban on the felling of khejri trees for solar power projects. The protest site was initially the Polytechnic College ground near the Collectorate before shifting to the Bishnoi Dharamshala, where the hunger strike continues.In Bikaner, markets remained closed for hours on Monday after a call by trader associations. Government and private schools in urban areas observed a half-day holiday in solidarity. Thousands gathered at the Polytechnic College ground before marching towards the Collectorate, where organisers announced an indefinite sit-in.Protesters came not only from different districts of Rajasthan but also from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Organisers said they had arranged food for nearly one lakh participants, with hundreds of volunteers handling logistics. Police deployed additional forces, erected barricades near the Collectorate and kept water cannons on standby. Despite the scale and tensions, the protest remained peaceful.Four protesters were admitted to Prince Bijay Singh Memorial Hospital as their health deteriorated during the hunger strike, while several others received medical assistance at camps set up near the site.Mokhram Dharaniya, one of the hospitalised protesters, said, “People are sitting on a hunger strike, including me. Our protest will continue until our demands are met.”At the centre of the agitation are allegations that large numbers of khejri trees have been cut to facilitate solar power projects in western Rajasthan. The region has emerged as a hub for renewable energy, given its high solar irradiance and availability of land. While solar development is central to India’s energy transition goals, protesters argue that project implementation has come at the cost of ecologically vital trees.Tensions escalated when the state government announced a restriction on felling khejri trees only in the Jodhpur and Bikaner divisions. Protesters rejected the move as inadequate, demanding a blanket statewide ban. During one address by a government representative, protesters reportedly took away the microphone, insisting on a written assurance.Minister for skill, employment and entrepreneurship KK Bishnoi and State Animal Welfare Board chairman Jaswant Bishnoi visited the Bishnoi Dharamshala and offered juice to the hunger strikers in an attempt to persuade them to break their fast.The minister said the government was ready to provide a written commitment and appealed to protesters to end the hunger strike. However, saints on the stage refused to withdraw without formal documentation.Agitation leader Parsaram Bishnoi said, “The hunger strike did not end. The government order was incomplete as it failed to cover the entire state.”Former minister Bhanwar Singh Bhati said: “All sections of society participating in the agitation decided to continue until a complete ban on cutting Khejri trees was imposed across Rajasthan.”The issue has resonated in the Rajasthan Assembly. Congress MLA Dungar Ram Gedar raised the matter during Zero Hour, accusing the government of failing to act despite a persistent two-year protest led by the Bishnoi community in Bikaner.“Khejri being the state tree, there is an urgent need for a strict law to protect it,” Gedar said.Independent MLA Ravindra Singh Bhati stated that the matter was already under discussion in the assembly. “Bhagat Singh (the Indian freedom fighter) said that sometimes a blast is needed to make the voice heard. If it takes gheraoing the Assembly to save khejri, I will be at the forefront,” he said.Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma told the assembly that his government was drafting a conservation law for the khejri tree, which he described as the state’s “Kalpavriksha”.“In August, saints from Bikaner, Phalodi, Jodhpur and Nagaur met me. Following that, I instructed officials to prepare the draft legislation. The process is under way, and it will soon be presented in the assembly,” he said.The chief minister also used the assembly session to defend his government’s broader record, speaking about economic growth, recruitment reforms and water supply projects.However, protesters have maintained that until a formal statewide ban is issued, the agitation will continue.Former chief minister and senior Congress leader Ashok Gehlot expressed support for the public movement, describing the indiscriminate cutting of khejri trees in the name of development as “extremely painful and unacceptable.”He recalled the historical sacrifice associated with the tree and said environmental protection must be prioritised.In a development seen as politically significant, former chief minister Vasundhara Raje publicly backed the movement that has put her own party, the BJP, in the dock.Sharing a photograph of herself worshipping a khejri tree, she wrote, “I also worship the Khejri tree. Rising above politics, we should all come forward to protect it. We must save it. I stand with everyone in the campaign to save the Khejri tree and the Oran (grazing land).” She also quoted a proverb revered in the Bishnoi community:(If a tree can be saved, even at the cost of one’s head, consider it a bargain).Observers have noted that her intervention has added to political pressure on the state government.Any discussion of the khejri in Rajasthan inevitably returns to the events of 1730 in the village of Khejarli near Jodhpur. According to historical accounts, 363 members of the Bishnoi community, led by Amrita Devi Bishnoi, sacrificed their lives to prevent the felling of khejri trees ordered for royal construction.The episode, often referred to as the Khejarli massacre, is widely regarded as one of the earliest recorded instances of environmental resistance. Amrita Devi is said to have declared that the loss of her head would be a small price to save a tree. Her sacrifice and that of the others form a cornerstone of Bishnoi identity and environmental ethics in the region.Protesters in the current agitation have repeatedly invoked this legacy. Even Ashok Gehlot referred to the sacrifice of 363 individuals, including Amrita Devi Bishnoi, and said their legacy should be honoured.The khejri is uniquely adapted to arid (extremely dry) and semi-arid climates. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater and survive prolonged drought. Unlike many other species, it does not compete aggressively with crops and is often grown in agricultural fields in a traditional agroforestry system.An agroforestry system is a land-use practice where trees are grown alongside crops or livestock on the same land to improve productivity and sustainability.Its leaves, known as “loong,” are used as fodder for livestock. Its pods, called “sangri,” are a staple ingredient in traditional Rajasthani cuisine, particularly in the dish. The wood is used as fuel and timber, while its bark and other parts have been used in traditional medicine.Ecologically, the tree improves soil fertility by fixing nitrogen, reduces desertification by stabilising sand dunes and provides shade in extreme heat. In regions where annual rainfall is minimal, it plays a crucial role in sustaining both human and animal life.Given these attributes, many in Rajasthan see the khejri not just as a tree but as a symbol of resilience and survival in a harsh environment.Currently, khejri trees are protected under various forest and environmental regulations, but protesters argue that enforcement is inconsistent and that ambiguities in existing laws create loopholes. Former Luni MLA Mahendra Vishnoi said, “Confusion exists in current laws concerning khejri conservation. The penalties must be precise and severe. Without a fear of the law, this destruction will persist.”Environmental activist Mokhram Dharniya alleged administrative inaction. “The administration has betrayed us repeatedly. Over the past year, we have held numerous protests, receiving assurances each time, while the trees continue to be axed. We will not permit the cutting of khejri anymore,” he said.One of the demands emerging from the agitation is a provision imposing a fine of Rs 1 lakh for violations. Activists have also called for a temporary statewide ban on felling until a comprehensive conservation law is enacted.The agitation has extended beyond Bikaner. In Barmer, protesters gathered at the Collectorate, and some youths climbed the gate and raised slogans after police closed the premises. A memorandum addressed to the chief minister was submitted.The movement has also taken on a deeply personal dimension for some families. Following the death of environmental activist Radheshyam Bishnoi in a road accident last year, his mother Ratni Devi and wife Nirma Bishnoi have continued his work and are now on a hunger strike demanding protection for khejri trees.Meanwhile, reports of illegal logging in other parts of the state, including in the forest area of Bayana subdivision in Bharatpur district, have further fuelled concerns about enforcement.Activists said the issue concerns the entire desert belt, including Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jodhpur, Pali, Jalore, Phalodi, Sriganganagar, and Churu.Protesters alleged that thousands of khejri trees were felled in recent years, largely for infrastructure and solar power projects.Founder of the Khejri Bachao Andolan, Parasram Bishnoi, said the agitation would continue until the state enacts a specific law making the cutting of khejri trees a punishable offence.“Large tracts of desert land are being indiscriminately handed over to solar parks, destroying the local ecosystem. Without legal protection, the desert’s survival is at stake,” Bishnoi told TOI.He added that participation is swelling daily and asserted that the onus now lies on the state government led by chief minister Bhajan Lal Sharma.Bishnoi alleged that khejri trees were uprooted across vast desert areas both in the name of renewable energy projects and by an illegal wood mafia, with little effective oversight.The unfolding debate reflects a broader tension between renewable energy expansion and environmental safeguards. Rajasthan is a key state in India’s solar mission. Large tracts of land are being allocated for solar parks, transmission corridors and associated infrastructure.While renewable energy is seen as essential for climate mitigation, local communities argue that development planning must take into account ecological realities and traditional land-use patterns. The khejri, embedded in agricultural and grazing systems, is not easily replaceable.For many protesters, the demand is not to halt development but to ensure that it does not erode the ecological foundation of desert life.As the Khejri Bachao Andolan entered its sixth day, its trajectory remains uncertain. The state government has indicated it is drafting legislation. Protesters insist on immediate written assurances and a comprehensive statewide ban.What is clear is that the agitation has tapped into a powerful historical memory and a deeply rooted cultural ethos. The khejri tree stands at the intersection of ecology, economy and identity in Rajasthan. Its fate has become a test case for how the state balances development with conservation in one of India’s most fragile landscapes.Whether the movement results in a new conservation law, stricter enforcement or a recalibration of project implementation, it has already reaffirmed the enduring symbolic power of a tree that many in Rajasthan consider their “Kalpavriksha”.","What began in bikaner as a local objection to the alleged felling of khejri trees for solar power projects has since evolved into the ‘khejri bachao andolan’ the movement has drawn support across party lines, producing a rare moment of political convergence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128031778,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-121300,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Weeks After Noida Techie's Death, Delhi Biker Dies After Falling Into Pit Dug By Jal Board

Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta has issued an eight-point safety framework to prevent Janakpuri-like accidents where a biker died after falling into a DJB dug pit, and sought a list of excavation sites in the city within three days.Taking a ""very strong"" view of the tragic accident reported in the Janakpuri area of west Delhi on Friday, the chief minister has ordered immediate, time-bound action across all departments and executing agencies to prevent any recurrence of such an incident, a Delhi CMO statement said.""Expressing deep concern over lapses in safety arrangements at excavation and digging sites, the chief minister has directed strict enforcement of safety norms and fixed clear accountability on officers and contractors,"" it said.The chief secretary, on the directions of the chief minister, has issued a memorandum listing an eight-point safety framework to be followed without exception at all construction, repair and maintenance works involving digging or excavation of roads, footpaths and underground utilities across the city.According to the eight-point directive, all work sites must display proper and adequate warning signage prominently and sufficiently in advance from all approaches.Reflector lights, blinkers and luminous tapes are to be mandatorily installed around excavated areas and barricades, especially during night hours and in low-visibility conditions.Asserting that loss of life due to negligence is unacceptable, Gupta asserted that public safety cannot be compromised under any circumstances. Accountability will be fixed, and strict action will follow wherever lapses are found, she said in the statement.""The chief minister has made it clear that the safety of citizens is paramount. No department or contractor will be allowed to cut corners, and enforcement on the ground will be closely monitored,"" the statement read further.The directive applies to all departments and agencies under the administrative control of the Delhi government, including Public Works Department (PWD), Irrigation and Flood Control Department (I&FC), Delhi Jal Board (DJB), Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), power distribution companies (DISCOMs) and all other executing agencies and contractors.The chief minister has also ordered that strong, continuous and clearly visible barricading be ensured around the entire work site by all departments to prevent accidental access by pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles.Barricades must be erected in a manner that eliminates the risk of accidents and ensures that no excavated material or open digging is visible to passersby or causes dust pollution.The directive fixes clear responsibility for compliance on both the concerned field officers and the executing agencies or contractors, the CMO said.Engineers-in-charge and field engineers have been instructed to conduct regular inspections of all such work sites and ensure that prescribed safety measures are maintained throughout the execution period.In a time-bound move, all departments and organisations have been ordered to carry out an immediate review of all ongoing and recently undertaken excavation and digging works within Delhi. A consolidated report detailing the locations of such sites, safety measures in place, and corrective steps taken wherever deficiencies are noticed must be submitted to the chief secretary's office within three days.The chief minister has made it unequivocally clear that any violation, laxity or non-compliance with these instructions will be viewed seriously, the statement noted.In the event of any accident, injury or loss of life attributable to negligence, strict disciplinary action will be initiated against responsible officers and agencies in accordance with rules, in addition to any other legal action that may be warranted.All departments have also been directed to immediately issue instructions to subordinate offices, field officials and executing agencies and to ensure regular monitoring and strict enforcement of these safety measures at all work sites, the statement added.","Delhi chief minister rekha gupta has issued an eight-point safety framework to prevent janakpuri-like accidents.

CHENNAI: Diversity in judicial appointments, regional benches of the Supreme Court, increase in the retirement age of high court judges from 62 to 65 and the constitutional status for the collegium which selects and transfers judges — these are the salient features of a private member Bill moved by the DMK’s Rajya Sabha member P Wilson seeking necessary amendments to the Constitution. It seeks representation for candidates from SC/ST and OBCs in proportion to their population.Wilson proposed measures to bring greater transparency to appointments in the higher judiciary. The Bill called for the establishment of permanent regional benches of the Supreme Court in Chennai, New Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata.Other primary changes sought by the member included an amendment to Article 15 (prohibits discrimination) of the Constitution to allow state govts to make special provisions for socially and educationally backward classes, SCs, and STs, in proportion to their population as determined by a caste census.In matters of judicial appointments, the member proposed amendments to Articles 124, 217, and 224 to include new clauses to ensure representation of SCs, STs, OBCs, religious minorities and women proportional to their population in judicial appointments, mandating the Union govt to frame a Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) in consultation with the Chief Justice of India (CJI) outlining appointment procedures.“State govts must be consulted when appointing judges to the HCs and the apex court.The Centre must act on collegium recommendations within 60 days, and within 30 days if reiterated,” Wilson said.This apart, the Bill proposed increasing the retirement age of HC judges from 62 to 65 years. Another main ingredient of the Bill was the proposal for changes to census powers under the seventh schedule of the Constitution.The Bill sought to modify the legislative powers relating to the census by removing the census from the Union list and adding it to the concurrent list of the Constitution, allowing both the Union and state govts to conduct census exercises.","Dmk’s rajya sabha member p wilson seeks necessary amendments to the constitution.

Oil-smuggling syndicate exposed at sea: Coast Guard intercepts 3 vessels near Mumbai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/oil-smuggling-syndicate-exposed-at-sea-coast-guard-intercepts-3-vessels-near-mumbai/articleshow/128037175.cms,"Image/X

NEW DELHI: The Indian Coast Guard (ICG) on Friday intercepted three vessels about 100 nautical miles west of Mumbai, busting an international oil-smuggling racket during a coordinated mid-sea operation carried out on February 5–6.The operation followed intelligence gathered through technology-enabled maritime surveillance. According to the Coast Guard, the vessels were involved in the illegal transfer of oil and oil-based cargo sourced from conflict-ridden regions, using mid-sea ship-to-ship transfers in international waters to evade customs duties owed to coastal states, including India.Sharing details in a post on X, the Indian Coast Guard said that the action was the result of a “meticulously coordinated sea–air operation.” It said the syndicate “exploited mid-sea transfers in international waters to move cheap oil from conflict-ridden regions to motor tankers, evading duties owed to coastal states.”Explaining how the operation unfolded, the ICG said that its technology-driven systems first detected a motor tanker showing suspicious behaviour within the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).This led to a digital investigation and data-pattern analysis, which identified two more vessels converging on the tanker, raising suspicion of an illicit oil transfer at sea.According to the Coast Guard, specialist boarding teams intercepted the three vessels and carried out sustained rummaging operations.“Electronic data corroboration, verification of documents and interrogation of crew exposed the modus operandi and a global handler network,” the ICG said in its post.Initial investigations revealed that the vessels frequently changed their identities to evade law enforcement by coastal states. The Coast Guard said that the racket was run by a network of handlers operating from multiple countries, coordinating the sale and transfer of oil cargo between seagoing vessels.The intercepted vessels are being escorted to Mumbai for further investigation and will be handed over to Indian Customs and other law enforcement agencies for legal action.Describing the broader significance of the operation, the Coast Guard said the crackdown reinforced India’s role as a “net provider of maritime security and guardian of the rules-based international order” in the region.",The indian coast guard (icg) intercepted three vessels about 100 nautical miles west of mumbai.

'Shree Ram Mandir Mayur Vihar': Mayur Vihar Pocket 1 metro station gets new name,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shree-ram-mandir-mayur-vihar-metro-station-mayur-vihar-pocket-1-gets-new-name/articleshow/128035820.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The Mayur Vihar Pocket 1 Metro station in East Delhi has been renamed to Shree Ram Mandir Mayur Vihar. The station is located on the Pink Line of the Delhi Metro The renamed station connects several key parts of the capital, including Anand Vihar Railway Station, Rajouri Garden, Lajpat Nagar and Delhi Cantonment, making it an important transit point for daily commuters.Explaining the reason behind the name change, Sanatan Dharm Sabha Mayur Vihar President RP Agarwal said that the demand had been pending for years.“Our committee has been working on this for the past three years. We had sent a letter to Virendra Sachdeva, who forwarded it to the Chief Minister. This is an important achievement for us. When the metro train moves forward from Mayur Vihar Phase 1, the announcement will be made that the next station is ‘Shree Ram Mandir Mayur Vihar’. This will increase the popularity of our Ram temple,” Agarwal said.Highlighting commuter convenience, Sanatan Dharm Sabha patron and Delhi Senior Citizen Welfare Association Vice President Govind Singh Pawar said that the earlier name often caused confusion.“People used to get confused between Mayur Vihar Phase 1 and Mayur Vihar Pocket 1. The BJP government, which promotes Sanatan Dharma, has corrected this.The people are very happy with this decision,” he said.The renaming fits into a broader policy of revising metro station names to better reflect local identity and reduce confusion for passengers.Last year, Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta announced the renaming of three metro stations to enhance passenger convenience. Pitampura Metro Station on the Red Line was renamed to Madhuban Chowk Metro Station, while two stations on the under-construction RK Puram–Janakpuri corridor will be called North Pitampura–Prashant Vihar Metro Station and Haiderpur Village Metro Station.Addressing the public at the time, Gupta said the changes were linked to local history and identity. She later wrote on X that the renaming was being done “for the convenience of passengers” and to clearly define neighbourhoods.","The station is located on the pink line of the delhi metro.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi government has enhanced the financial powers of the city's municipal commissioner from Rs 5 crore to Rs 50 crore, paving the way for faster project approvals, the CMO said on Saturday.Regarding the decision, chief minister Rekha Gupta said empowering local bodies for development is the government's top priority.She emphasised that the decision has been taken with public interest at its core and will directly benefit the people of the capital.Timely execution of development works will ensure better utilisation of resources, enhance the effectiveness of public expenditure, she said.At present, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) commissioner is empowered to approve projects only up to Rs 5 crore. Projects exceeding this amount required approval from the corporation's standing committee, followed by final clearance from the House of the Corporation, an statement by the Delhi chief minister office said.This multi-tiered approval mechanism often led to avoidable delays in the execution of development works, it said.""By increasing the commissioner's financial powers to Rs 50 crore, the implementation process of schemes will become simpler, faster, and more effective,"" the statement said.The enhanced delegation of powers will facilitate the timely execution of works related to roads, drains, sanitation, community facilities, and other essential civic services, it said.It will also help accelerate long-pending projects, reduce procedural bottlenecks, and ensure that development initiatives reach citizens without unnecessary delay, the statement added.","The delhi government has enhanced the financial powers of the city's municipal commissioner.
