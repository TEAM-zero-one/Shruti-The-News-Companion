Census pre-test from November 10 to November 30; self-enumeration during November 1-10,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/census-pre-test-from-november-10-to-november-30-self-enumeration-during-november-1-10/articleshow/124618465.cms,"NEW DELHI: The pre-test for houselisting phase of Census 2027 will be undertaken from Nov 10 to Nov 30, 2025 in selected sample areas spread across all states and Union territories, the Centre announced in a notification issued on Thursday.The pre-test — meant to test efficacy of the census questionnaire, proposed data collection methods including via the digital mode and other logistics – will allow an option of self-enumeration to the respondents between Nov 1 and Nov 7, 2025.The pre-test will cover only the houselisting and housing phase of the upcoming census exercise — which gets underway in April 1, 2026 — as per the notification issued by MHA in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 17A of the Census Act, 1948, read with rule 6D of the Census Rules, 1990.The home ministry had on June 16, 2025, notified its intent to conduct Census 2027 — the first ever to be done in the digital mode — with March 1, 2027, as the reference date. For the UT of Ladakh and snow-bound areas of J&K, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, the reference date would be advanced by six months, to 00.00 hours of the first day of October 2026.According to sources, Census 2027 - which is likely to put out final population data by 2027-end, setting the stage for delimitation and, based on it, implementation of women's quota in legislatures by the 2029 general election and, eventually, increase in strength of the Lok Sabha and state assemblies - is likely to replicate the schedule of past decennial exercises.It will be held in two phases - housing listing operations, likely between April 1, 2026, and Sept 2026, followed by population enumeration from Feb 9 to 28, 2027.Caste enumeration - a first since the 1931 Census - is likely to be done in the second phase of population enumeration. Unlike the 2011 exercises, no parallel updation of the Narional Population Register (NPR) is planned along with Census 2027.A four-day, intensive training of lead trainers for Census 2027 pre-test was conducted last week at the Registrar General of India and Census Commissioner’s office here on Friday. These lead trainers are now training the enumerators in the states/Union territories, following which the pre-test will be taken up in the field.A pre-test was last conducted for Census 2021 — before the exercise had to be put on hold on account of the Covid pandemic — in August-September 2019. However, since the Census methods have since been updated — with major improvements in applications to capture data and options of self-enumeration for both the houselisting and population enumeration phase — a fresh pre-test was deemed necessary. No fresh questionnaire has been notified yet for Census 2027; in all probability, there shall be no change in the data fields to be captured in the houselisting phase.Refresher training in the coming days will reorient the 34 lakh enumerators and supervisors and 1.3 lakh Census functionaries in the use of Census apps and the Census management and monitoring system.","The pre-test will cover only the houselisting and housing phase of the upcoming census exercise.

SC dismisses Telangana plea against HC stay on 42% OBC quota,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-dismisses-telangana-plea-against-hc-stay-on-42-obc-quota/articleshow/124617676.cms,".

New Delhi: Supreme Court Thursday dismissed Telangana govt’s plea challenging a high court order staying implementation of 42% reservation for backward classes in local body polls.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta asked Telangana HC to decide the main matter on merits.“You may continue with your elections. The order shall not affect the HC in deciding the case on its own merits,” it said while dismissing the petition.On Oct 9, HC said increase in OBC quota appeared to violate the 50% limit set for reservations by SC and stayed the govt order. It had said the local body elections could proceed without implementing the proposed quota hike. Telangana had passed three govt orders — one on provision of 42% reservation to OBC in local bodies, and two consequential orders laying down on guidelines for fixation of such reservations in respect to elections to mandal praja parishads, zilla praja parishads and gram panchayats under Telangana Panchayat Raj Act, 2018.","Justices vikram nath and sandeep mehta asked telangana hc to decide the main matter on merits.

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: In a surprising development, Supreme Court’s five-judge collegium led by CJI B R Gavai has spelled out the reason — Union govt’s objection — for changing the transfer destination of Madhya Pradesh HC’s Justice Atul Sreedharan from Chhattisgarh HC to Allahabad HC.Two months ago, the collegium had uploaded a statement on its August 25-26 meetings that resulted in recommending Centre transfer 14 judges from HCs where they were discharging their duties to other ones. Justice Sreedharan’s name figured at the top of the list, specifying that he was being transferred from MP HC to Chhattisgarh HC.On October 14, the collegium statement said it acceded to the government’s request for reconsideration of Justice Sreedharan’s transfer to Chhattisgarh, where he would have been senior enough to be part of the HC collegium, and “resolved to recommend” his transfer from MP HC to Allahabad HC, where he would not be in the collegium.This incident brings to fore the increasing influence of Centre, which in the past has stalled or long delayed giving effect to three-judge SC collegium decisions recommending appointments of several persons as HC judges, in the sphere of transfers. SC through its judgments had given primacy to the collegium in matters of appointment and transfers of HC and SC judges.Interestingly, recommendations of the same five-member collegium for appointment of SC judges have been notified with extreme expedition, sometimes in 48 hours, by the government in the past.However, several recommendations by the collegium, comprising CJI and four most senior judges, for transfers have been selectively put in cold storage by the government without assigning any reason. Surprisingly, the SC collegium through CJI has not made attempts to give effect to its recommendations pertaining to transfers.This has left those HC judges, whose transfers have been recommended by the collegium but not given effect, in a piquant situation — whether to take up cases that require detailed hearing or to wind up pending work.A similar incident took place eight years ago. Then 5-J collegium led by incumbent CJI Dipak Misra had recommended transfer of Karnataka HC’s Justice Jayant Patil, who during his stint at Gujarat HC had ordered a probe into the Ishrat Jahan case, to Bombay HC.The government immediately conveyed its disagreement to the proposal. The collegium hurriedly met at the residence of one of the judges and changed the transfer destination to Allahabad HC. Justice Patil tendered his resignation to the President.",Supreme court's five-judge collegium led by cji b r gavai has spelled out the reason — union govt’s objection — for changing the transfer destination of justice atul sreedharan from chhattisgarh hc to allahabad hc.

NEW DELHI: Cautioning high courts, and itself, against routinely ordering CBI probes, Supreme Court on Thursday said courts should invoke their power to direct an inquiry by the central agency as a last resort in an exceptional situation.A bench of justices J K Maheshwari and Vijay Bishnoi set aside Allahabad high court’s order directing a CBI probe into alleged irregularities in the recruitment process for UP legislative council staff, saying the order was passed by HC on the basis of some doubt and assumptions. The bench also referred the matter back to the high court for a rehearing.“It is well settled that directions for CBI inquiry should not be ordered by the high courts or this court in a routine manner. The jurisprudence, as developed by this court through judgments qua the direction of an investigation by CBI is well settled. It imposes a significant self-restraint on the exercise of this extraordinary constitutional power under Article 32 or Article 226 of the Constitution. The exercise of inherent powers to direct CBI to investigate must be exercised sparingly, cautiously and only in exceptional situations,” Justice Maheshwari, who penned the judgment for the bench, said.“This court has consistently cautioned that a CBI investigation should not be directed as a matter of routine or merely because a party casts certain aspersions or harbours a subjective lack of confidence in the state police. It goes without saying that for invoking this power, the court concerned must be satisfied that the material placed prima facie discloses commission of offences and necessitates a CBI investigation to ensure the fundamental right to a fair and impartial investigation, or where the complexity, scale or national ramification of such allegations demands expertise of central agency,” he said.The bench said while there was no inflexible guideline to decide when such power should be exercised, courts may do it when a case had national or international ramifications. Interestingly, a bench headed by Justice Maheshwari, through an interim order on Monday, had directed CBI to probe the Karur stampede case in Tamil Nadu.Cautioning against burdening a central agency with matters that do not satisfy the threshold of an exceptional case, SC added: “An order directing an investigation to be carried out by CBI should be treated as a measure of last resort, justified only when the constitutional court is convinced that the integrity of the process has been compromised or has reasons to believe that it may get compromised to a degree that shakes the conscience of courts or public faith in the justice delivery system. ”“Such compelling circumstances may typically arise when the materials brought in notice of the court prima facie point towards systemic failure, the involvement of high-ranking state officials or politically influential persons, or when the local police’s conduct itself creates a reasonable doubt in the minds of the citizenry regarding their ability to conduct a neutral probe,” the bench said.",A bench of justices j k maheshwari and vijay bishnoi set aside allahabad high court’s order directing a cbi probe into alleged irregularities in the recruitment process for up legislative council staff.

New Delhi: Integrating passport issuance with law enforcement, creating a comprehensive database of fugitives and special focus groups to handle extraditions and economic offenders were some of the measures proposed by home minister Amit Shah to tackle transnational crimes, reports Rajshekhar Jha.Addressing a CBI-organised conference, Shah said the Modi govt was striving to bring every fugitive involved in economic, cyber, terrorist incidents, or organised crime before the law with a ruthless approach.“We can’t secure the country until those sitting abroad who harm the nation’s economy, sovereignty and security fear the Indian justice system.

Varun Chakaravarthy post

A fifth-grade student from Gandhinagar, Gujarat, Ishit Bhatt, who appeared on Kaun Banega Crorepati 17 hosted by Amitabh Bachchan , faced intense social media criticism for his behavior on the show. Indian cricketer Varun Chakaravarthy, who recently led India to victory in the Asia Cup 2025, came to the student's defense on social media platform X, condemning the online abuse directed at the minor.The incident gained attention after clips from the show went viral, showing Ishit's interactions with host Amitabh Bachchan during the question-and-answer segment of the popular quiz show.During his appearance, Ishit displayed what many viewed as assertive behavior towards the show's format and host.""Mere ko rules pata hai isliye aap mereko abhi rules samjhane mat baithna,"" Ishit was heard saying on the show, indicating he already knew the rules and didn't need an explanation.The student continued with similar responses throughout his appearance, making demands about the game's progression.""Arre option daalo,"" he said while waiting for the options to be displayed on screen.When it came time to confirm his answer, Ishit stated, ""Sir ek kya uss mein chaar lock lagado, lekin lock karo.""The student's participation on the show ended without any prize money after he incorrectly answered a question about the Valmiki Ramayana.When asked to identify the first kanda of the Valmiki Ramayana, Ishit chose Ayodhya Kanda instead of the correct answer, Bala Kanda.Amitabh Bachchan addressed the situation during the show, saying, ""Kabhi kabhi bachhe over confidence mein galti kar dete hai.""The incident sparked widespread discussion on social media, with many criticizing the child's behavior and raising questions about parenting and the pressure faced by young participants on reality shows.Varun Chakaravarthy took to X to defend the young contestant, stating: ""Example of how social media has become a place for cowards running their mouths without any sense! He is a kid, for God's sake!! Let him grow!! If u can't tolerate a kid, imagine the society still tolerating many nut cases like the ones commenting on this kid and much more!!!!!!""The controversy has led to broader discussions about the nature of social media criticism, particularly when directed at minors appearing on television shows.The incident has also highlighted the challenges faced by young participants in reality television shows and the public scrutiny they encounter.Social media users have praised Amitabh Bachchan's composed handling of the situation during the show's recording.","A fifth-grade student from gandhinagar, gujarat, appeared on kaun banega crorepati 17 hosted by amitabh bachchan.

If I have said anything wrong, I ask her to forgive me. I will render countless obeisance at her feet. But I ask her to help my daughter get justice,"" the victim’s father told TV channels, according to PTI.""I have been demanding a CBI probe into this case. I think that would be good. But that depends on the state administration as well,"" he added.His remarks come days after he criticised the chief minister for her comment that ""women should not venture out at night,"" following the assault of his daughter, a second-year MBBS student at a private medical college in Durgapur.Earlier on Monday, the survivor's father stated that, ""She (Mamata Banerjee) is also a woman. How can she say such an irresponsible thing? Should women quit their jobs and sit at home? It seems Bengal is under the rule of Aurangzeb.""He further expressed a loss of faith in West Bengal's law and order situation and said he wanted to take his daughter back to Odisha for her safety. ""I want to take my daughter back to Odisha. Her life comes first, her career later,"" he added.The controversy began after Mamata Banerjee, while addressing the media about the crime, said, ""I learned that she was outside the campus at 12.30 am. Students residing in hostels should refrain from venturing out at night. Private medical colleges must ensure the safety of their students, particularly female students, who should not be permitted to leave the premises at night. Girls should protect themselves as well. ""Defending the police, Banerjee had said it was not possible for officers to monitor everyone's movements or stand guard outside every house.Her comments, however, drew sharp criticism from opposition leaders, women’s rights groups, and the Odisha government, who accused her of victim-blaming.Mamata later clarified that her statement had been ""distorted and taken out of context."" ""The media distorted my words. You ask me a question, I answer it, and then you distort it. Do not try this kind of politics,"" she asserted.The 22-year-old MBBS student was allegedly gang-raped on October 10 after she stepped out of her college campus with a male friend to get food.Police have so far arrested six people, including the friend, in connection with the case, which has triggered widespread outrage and political uproar across the state.","Father of durgapur gang rape victim seeks forgiveness from west bengal chief minister.

EPFO subscribers take note! The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members. Under the revised rules, members can now withdraw their provident fund after 12 months of unemployment and their pension after 36 months, PTI reported.The change was approved by the apex decision-making body of the EPFO, the Central Board of Trustees, chaired by Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, during a meeting held on Monday. Earlier, the scheme allowed full withdrawals from both accounts after just two months of continuous unemployment.A senior official explained PTI that the move aims to ensure social security for formal sector workers who typically exit the EPFO after two months of unemployment. “Most of these unemployed youth need to enrol again when they secure new jobs and lose chances of earning pension and other benefits, as an account becomes pensionable only after a combined service of 10 years or more,” the official said.The ministry said the revision will also allow partial withdrawals, enabling members to meet immediate financial needs without affecting their retirement savings or pension entitlements.Additionally, a provision has been introduced to maintain a minimum balance of 25 per cent of contributions in members’ accounts at all times.“This will enable members to enjoy the high interest rate currently offered by the EPFO, 8.25 per cent per annum, along with compounding benefits to build a sizeable retirement corpus,” the statement added.The rationalisation is intended to improve ease of access while ensuring members maintain a sufficient retirement fund over the long term.","Epfo has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members.

NEW DELHI: The Karnataka cabinet on Thursday decided to frame new rules to regulate Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) activities, including marches and events held on government-owned properties and public roads, information technology and biotechnology minister Priyank Kharge said, according to PTI.The decision follows a letter from Kharge to chief minister Siddaramaiah, seeking a ban on RSS activities and those of its affiliated organizations in public and government spaces.Speaking to reporters after the cabinet meeting, Kharge said, ""The rules we want to bring is regarding public places, government schools, colleges, government premises, government owned institutions and aided institutions. We will bring together the previous orders issued by the home department, law department, and the education department to frame a new rule. In the next two to three days, the new rule will come into force within the framework of law and the Constitution. ""He clarified that while the government cannot control any organisation outright, “from now on you cannot do whatever you want in public places or roads. Whatever you have to do, it has to be done after seeking the government’s permission.""Kharge further explained that granting permission will be at the government’s discretion. ""There are parameters to grant permission... You cannot walk on the road waving sticks or take out ‘Patha Sanchalana’ (march) just by giving intimation to the authorities. All these things will be part of the rules we are going to introduce,"" he added.The move comes amid ongoing concerns expressed by Congress over RSS activities in government institutions and public spaces, underscoring the state government's intention to regulate public demonstrations and maintain order.","The karnataka cabinet on thursday decided to frame new rules to regulate rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss) activities.

Bihar Polls: UP CM Yogi Adityanath Accuses RJD, Congress of ‘Mischief’ Over Burqa Verification Order

NEW DLEHI: Janhit Janata Dal (JJD) chief and Lalu Yadav ’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav , who is set to contest from Mahua constituency in the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections , filed his nomination on Thursday accompanied by a roadshow and carrying a photo of his grandmother Marchiya Devi.Speaking to reporters, he said the occasion was significant for him as he had moved ahead with the blessings of his grandmother and parents.""I have moved ahead with the blessings of my grandmother and my parents. On this auspicious occasion, as I am required to file my nomination, I have brought my grandmother with me. She lives on in our hearts... People of Mahua will support whoever works for them. I worked to make Mahua a district and also give employment opportunities to the youth,"" Tej Pratap said, as quoted by ANI.Tej Pratap, who currently represents Hasanpur, had earlier served as Mahua MLA from 2015 to 2020. The seat is now held by RJD’s Mukesh Kumar Raushan.The JJD, which Tej Pratap floated after his expulsion from the RJD earlier this year, has announced 22 candidates in its first list for the assembly elections scheduled for November. His expulsion from the party followed a controversy involving a social media post where he claimed to be in a long-term relationship.Tej Pratap had later stated that his account was hacked.His strained ties with his family have played out publicly in recent months. On October 12, he unfollowed his younger brother and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on X. He had earlier unfollowed his sisters Misa Bharti and Hema Yadav. He now follows only five accounts, including his father Lalu Prasad Yadav, mother Rabri Devi, and sister Raj Lakshmi Yadav.Despite family tensions, Tej Pratap’s sister Rohini Acharya extended her support to him with a message on X: ""May you achieve all the success and happiness in the world, and may you always move forward like a shining light, brother. Wishing you all the very best... with love and blessings.""It makes an interesting twist in the Yadav family dynamics, as last month Rohini Acharya did something similar to his elder brother Tej Pratap when she unfollowed RJD, and Tejaswi Yadav from her social media accounts. The increasing rifts between family members playing out in public are often attributed to sudden importance given to Sanjay Yadav, a close friend to Tejaswi.On being asked about the grandmother and Acharya he said, ""I brought the photo of my grandmother Marchiya Devi in the nomination.

As Bihar heads into a heated two-phase assembly election on November 6 and 11, the political scene saw a day of rapid developments on Thursday — from the Election Commission’s strong defence of its voter roll revision to the NDA completing its candidate lists, while the Mahagathbandhan (MGB) remains mired in seat-sharing talks. Tej Pratap Yadav filed his nomination amid family tensions, and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath took direct aim at the opposition over the burqa voter verification controversy.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) formally declared all its candidates for the 243-member Bihar Assembly, with both JD(U) and BJP announcing 101 seats each. Other allies, the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), the Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM) and the Hindustani Awami Morcha (HAM), have also completed their lists.JD(U)’s second list featured ministers Sheila Mandal, Vijendra Prasad Yadav, Leshi Singh, Jayant Raj and Zama Khan, along with turncoats Chetan Anand and Vibha Devi. “The JD(U) has now released all 101 candidates,” the party said.The BJP, meanwhile, unveiled its list of 40 star campaigners, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and party president JP Nadda. It also includes five chief ministers: Yogi Adityanath, Hemanta Biswa Sarma, Rekha Gupta, Mohan Yadav and Devendra Fadnavis — and a mix of senior leaders and Bhojpuri stars such as Pawan Singh, Manoj Tiwari and Ravi Kishan.The first phase of polling will be held on November 6, the second on November 11, and counting on November 14.The Congress Party unveiled its first list of 48 candidates for the Bihar election with no finalisation of a Mahagathbanthan seat-sharing deal yet.Among the prominent names, state Congress chief Rajesh Ram is set to contest from the Kutumba seat, while the Leader of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP), Shakeel Ahmad Khan, will represent the Kadwa constituency.The list includes a diverse group of candidates, ranging from Bagaha's Jayesh Mangal Singh to Patna Sahib's Shashant Shekhar.While the NDA went into campaign mode, the opposition Mahagathbandhan (MGB) is yet to finalise its seat-sharing formula. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav filed his nomination from Raghopur but refrained from announcing the alliance’s seat division.Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar said an agreement within the INDIA bloc would be announced “soon”. Speaking to reporters, he said, “Discussions are progressing in the right direction… the people believe in Tejashwi Yadav as their leader.”He accused the Nitish Kumar-led government of “failing to meet the people’s needs over the last 20 years” and cited a CAG report on Rs 73,000 crore in unutilised funds. “Bihar’s youth deserve better. Rats drinking liquor, stolen bridges and question paper leaks show the scale of corruption,” Kumar said.He confirmed he would not contest the election but would campaign across 243 constituencies, adding: “My beliefs have not changed. Only the platform has.”Janshakti Janata Dal (JJD) chief Tej Pratap Yadav filed his nomination from Mahua with a roadshow, carrying a photo of his grandmother. “I have moved ahead with the blessings of my grandmother and my parents. People of Mahua will support whoever works for them,” he said.Tej Pratap, earlier expelled from the RJD, now leads his own party after a public rift with his brother Tejashwi. He recently unfollowed Tejashwi on X, adding to speculation of a full family break.Mahua, currently held by RJD’s Mukesh Kumar Raushan, will now see a high-profile contest. Tej Pratap said he had worked to make Mahua a district and promised jobs for the youth.The Election Commission on Thursday defended the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of Bihar’s electoral roll before the Supreme Court, calling it “accurate” and dismissing allegations of Muslim voter exclusion as “false and communal”.“This communal approach is to be deprecated,” the poll body said in its affidavit, responding to a petition by the Association of Democratic Reforms and activist Yogendra Yadav. The EC told the court that “no appeal has been filed by any voter” since the publication of the final roll and that errors had been minimal.It added that 3.66 lakh names were deleted due to duplication, migration or deaths, and that “not a single objection has been reported so far”. The final voter count now stands at 7.42 crore — down by 47 lakh from the earlier list.The bench, led by Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi, posted the matter for further hearing on November 4.On the campaign trail in Danapur, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath accused the RJD-Congress combine of “mischief” over the EC’s decision to verify the identity of burqa-clad women voters.“Should fake voters be allowed to vote? The Congress and RJD want this to happen,” he said, claiming the opposition opposed electronic voting “because they want to restore the old system of booth capture”.He linked Bihar’s politics to cultural heritage, saying, “After the construction of a grand temple of Lord Ram at Ayodhya, the birthplace of Goddess Sita in Sitamarhi is all set for a facelift.”Calling the RJD’s allies “partners of the mafia”, Yogi declared, “Under NDA rule, they will meet the same fate in Bihar.”","Nda completes list, star campaigners announced for bihar assembly election.

Climate change becoming human rights imperative: Kovind,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/climate-change-becoming-human-rights-imperative-kovind/articleshow/124613695.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Former President Ram Nath Kovind Thursday cautioned that climate change is “no longer only an environmental concern but is becoming a human rights imperative”. The consequences of the challenges posed by climate change, manifesting in the form of floods, droughts and heatwaves, are borne largely by those who are least equipped to bear them, he said at a programme to mark the 32nd foundation day of the National Human Rights Commission ( NHRC ).During the event, which saw a day-long conference on human rights of prison inmates, Kovind also said the true test of a society’s values lies in how it treats those who are most vulnerable, including those who are in custody.NHRC chairperson Justice V Ramasubramanian said the commission has handled more than 23 lakh cases and about 2,900 cases of suo motu cognisance since its inception in 1993. NHRC has recommended monetary relief of more than Rs 263 crore in about more than 8,000 cases to victims of human rights violations.While noting that India has built a robust and comprehensive framework for the protection of human rights, Kovind asserted the need to recognise emerging and complex challenges. “We live in an age of unprecedented technological, environmental, and societal transformation. With the change in structure of employment in the modern economy, new forms of human rights concerns are emerging,” he said.He cited the example of workers in the informal sector, such as drivers, sanitation workers, construction labourers, and countless migrant workers and how too often, they endure unsafe working conditions, irregular incomes, and the absence of social protection. “Their human rights are frequently at risk,” he highlighted while emphasising that “economic progress must always walk hand in hand with human dignity”.",Former president ram nath kovind cautioned that climate change is ‘no longer only an environmental concern but is becoming a human rights imperative’ the consequences of the challenges posed by climate change are borne largely by those who are least equipped to bear them.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124613682,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-7612,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
