"Thank your parents, even when they’re difficult",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/thank-your-parents-even-when-theyre-difficult/articleshow/120826566.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

I was in a meeting and my phone on silent, when an unknown number lit up the screen repeatedly. Seven missed calls.

Once the session ended, I called back. A voice—low and hurried- answered. “Amma, driver here. They aren’t taking sir to the hospital. He’s very sick. Please don’t tell them I called you.” The line went dead. It took me a moment to recognize the driver.

His ‘sir’ was no ordinary person. A distant relative, he had been a businessman of stature. I remember visiting his office with my father, for his new office inauguration and dinner. A large reception, suited staff, and an air of authority – a world I had not known then.

But time did what it always does. Slowly, things changed. The sons took charge—of the house and the business. His room was moved to the rear. After his wife passed, he stopped attending family gatherings. The narrative changed. Various versions of complaints surfaced from his children : he was difficult and interfering, gave too much to the daughters.

My husband and I decided to stop by the house, pretending to be in the area. The family received us with polite reluctance. When we asked to see uncle, they pointed to a door that led to a narrow store room. The room smelled of urine, medicines and something else. A man, once known for his dominance, had grown thin, his dignity lost in the cracks of the walls.

We stood still.

After a few minutes, we firmly requested that he be taken to the hospital. The family resisted but finally relented. As we prepared to leave, he whispered, with folded hands, “nandri”.

In the shifting dynamics between parents and adult children, something has begun to disappear - the old rhythm of care , presence and endurance. The list of grievances is long on either side. Ageing parents seem fixed in their ways, while children find the weight of criticism, dogmatism and unresolved hurts pulling them back amid demands of spouses and careers.

The tragedy lies in the realization that you cannot return to the path of yesteryears. The hands that once held yours become frail, unrecognisable.

In some cases, like that of uncle, estrangement turns into quiet cruelty—driven by inheritance feuds, ego and emotional fatigue.

That night, I thought of all our scriptures, parables, and proverbs. One message echo across cultures: Take care of your parents. “There is no temple holier than one’s mother; no scripture purer than the words of one’s father,” says an ancient Tamil saying. “Honor your father and mother, so that your days may be long,” commands the Bible.

Interestingly, there is little in these scriptures about caring for one’s children. Why? Because it is natural to do so while it is not with parents. That is why cultures encode it into law, religion, and literature.

I could not recall any couplet by Valluvar that advised children to take care of their parents. He did talk about making the parents proud, but not about taking care of them.

But he has written something which is ever larger and more profound, about being grateful.

Ennandri Kondrarkkum Uyvundaam Uyvillai

SeiNandri Kondra Magarkku

One may slay all that is good and still find redemption.

But there is no salvation for the one who kills gratitude.

No lesson. Just a line that stays with you. Because, when gratitude dies, so does humanity.

Luckily, gratitude has not died altogether. The driver had it.

Did you visit Pakistan for a continuous period of 15 days? If so, could you kindly clarify the purpose of your visit?” Sarma had said in his post.""If so, may we ask why a Pakistan-based organisation is paying a salary for activities conducted in India?” Sarma had questioned.Responding to the CM, Gogoi had hit back, asking if Sarma would resign in case he fails to prove his allegations. ""Questions for the Hon’ble Chief Minister of Assam: 1) Will you resign if you fail to prove your allegations of me and my wife being agents of an enemy country? 2) Will you take questions on your own children and wife? 3) Will the state police arrest those linked to coal mafia who make are ravaging the hills of Assam and making crores of undeclared money?

Court nixes complaint against Gulmarg fashion show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/court-nixes-complaint-against-gulmarg-fashion-show/articleshow/120833561.cms,"Elle India

SRINAGAR: A Srinagar court has dismissed a case of obscenity and hurting religious sentiments against designers Shivan and Narresh and unidentified models over a fashion show held on ski resort Gulmarg’s snowy slopes this March.The court observed that the complaint, which included two screenshots showing one male and one female model in skimpy clothing, did not meet the legal standard for the offence of obscenity “in the broader scheme of the event”. The March 7 fashion show, during the holy month of Ramadan, had stirred a row and a political storm in Muslim-majority J&K, with chief cleric Mirwaiz Umar Farooq leading the offensive.“The complainant has affixed two screenshots showing one female and one male model in skimpy clothes. That is the sole fact appearing in the complaint alleged to be obscene. Accused on the other hand has placed on record material which show that in the fashion show several models participated, and the two models wearing skimpy clothes actually were showcasing swim wear for which the company of first accused has expertise,” special court judge Faizan Nazar held in his order on Thursday.Adil Ahmad Khan, a civilian, had filed the complaint, also naming the editor-in-chief ofmagazine, which ran Instagram reels from the show.The judge also dismissed claims of “outraging religious feelings”, observing that no court could take cognisance of a complaint filed by a private person in an offence under Section 299 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) (which prohibits insulting religious beliefs) without the prior sanction of the central or state govt.Mirwaiz had slammed the event as “outrageous” and “obscene.” Governing National Conference (NC) MP and Shia cleric Aga Ruhullah Mehdi called the show “shocking”. BJP’s J&K president Sunil Sharma blamed chief minister Omar Abdullah, saying the models and designers stayed at Nedous Hotel, owned by the CM’s relatives.Omar had acknowledged the hotel belonged to his relatives but denied any involvement with the show. Designer duo Shivan and Narresh issued an apology on March 9, saying their sole intention was to “celebrate creativity without any desire to offend anyone or religious sentiments”. Elle India responded by deleting the 0.35-second Instagram. reel.Despite the apologies, Khan filed the court complaint, saying he was “deeply hurt”. The fashion show, including its attire, choreography and behaviour of the participants were obscene and offensive, with its contents explicitly sexualised and disrespectful to the religious and cultural sensibilities of Muslims and Kashmiri culture in the holy month of Ramadan, Khan argued.Khan had also alleged offences under J&K Excise Act, 1958, which proscribes drinking in public or places of worship. The judge rejected this charge, saying the law barred taking cognisance of private complaints. The court further pointed out that Nedous Hotel had a four-hour permit for serving liquor on the day of the show.","A srinagar court has dismissed a case of obscenity and hurting religious sentiments against designers shivan and narresh and unidentified models.

The BNSS is therefore a progressive legislation in this regard and records among its objectives and reasons a 'citizens-centric criminal procedure' as the 'need of the hour'.""This benevolent intent of BNSS should be read in favour of the accused rather than the investigation agencies when a right to be heard is to be accorded at any stage of the proceedings, the judge said. The court said it does not come to any ""detriment"" if the accused is permitted to make submissions on the question of cognisance. ""In this adherence to the principles of fair hearing, the right to be heard is not inconsistent with any of the powers vested in the ED for investigation or the presumptions as well as the burden of proof stipulated under the PMLA,"" said the court.The court also noted the submissions of the ASG that ED is not opposing such a notice precisely because it is a votary of a fair trial. The court listed various reasons for issuing notice, including that the proviso to BNSS Sec 223 creates a sui generis right of the accused to be heard at the cognisance stage and is not inconsistent with the complaint procedure or other provisions under PMLA.""Such a right does not defeat or diminish the operation of any provision of PMLA. The proviso to BNSS Sec 223... is required to be read in favour of the proposed accused persons,"" the court said.","Delhi court issues a notice to congress functionaries sonia gandhi and rahul gandhi, and others in a money-laundering case related to the national herald newspaper.

Sharp judge-lawyer exchange of words in Chhattisgarh booze case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sharp-judge-lawyer-exchange-of-words-in-chhattisgarh-booze-case/articleshow/120834983.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Friday witnessed a sharp exchange of words between a bench headed by Justice Abhay S Oka and senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani after the lawyer alleged that Chhattisgarh govt's plea against former IAS officer Anil Tuteja was not being heard because of adjournments. The bench passed an order asking him to move the CJI for transfer of the case to another bench and reminded him that the govt itself had sought deferment of hearing on a few occasions.At the outset of hearing, Jethmalani told the bench that the state wanted custodial interrogation and pressed for an early hearing. The court, however, said the main case was still pending and hearing on vacation of interim order could be heard with it as the accused had already been directed to cooperate with the probe. Senior advocates Gopal Sankaranarayanan and Meenakshi Arora also briefed the court that the accused were appearing on every date.Jethmalani thereafter questioned the court's jurisdiction in granting interim relief and said ""this is not the province of the court"". Not accepting his submission, the bench said the court was not ""powerless"" to grant relief. ""If you are making grievances against the bench, then you can go before the Chief Justice. This is not the way to behave,"" the bench said.Countering Jethmalani's submission that the accused had sought adjournments, Sankaranarayanan challenged him to spell out the dates when hearing was deferred due to the accused and told the bench that the state itself had taken adjournment three times in the case.Jethmalani clarified that he was not making any allegation against the bench. ""Your lordships are misunderstanding what I said. I did not say anything about the bench. I pointed out the conduct of the parties,"" he added.The court, however, went on to pass an order allowing the state to ask the CJI to transfer the case to another bench. ""If we start adopting this approach - which advocate has taken adjournment how many times - it will be impossible for us to function,"" the bench told Jethmalani.A bench headed by Justice Oka had on April 15 granted Tuteja bail in a money laundering case arising out of the Chhattisgarh liquor scam, noting that Tuteja had been in custody for over a year and charges had not been framed against him and more than 30 prosecution witnesses were to be examined in the case.Based on allegations of ED 's ""high handedness"" and ""inhuman conduct"" in interrogating a person for almost 15 hours which went beyond midnight, SC had in Jan pulled up the agency and expressed concern over its approach in conducting probe.ED denied the charge and accused Tuteja of influencing witnesses with the help of Chhattisgarh Police and the ex-advocate general under the previous Congress govt. It also produced documents in support of its charge in a sealed envelope, which is said to have led to the transfer of an important judicial officer outside the state.",Senior advocate mahesh jethmalani alleged that chhattisgarh govt's plea against former ias officer anil tuteja was not being heard because of adjournments.

Instead, Vijayan highlighted the legacy of the 1996 LDF govt for originally envisioning the port, and credited the current administration for executing it against all odds.Vijayan stressed that Vizhinjam is the first large port in India to be developed under the leadership of a state govt, with Kerala bearing over 60% of the Rs 8,686cr project cost.He said that although the agreement originally scheduled the project completion by 2045, LDF govt ensured that commercial operations began in 2024.

SC urges law minister to make changes in arbitration bill yet to be taken up by Parliament,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-urges-law-minister-to-make-changes-in-arbitration-bill-yet-to-be-taken-up-by-parliament/articleshow/120834244.cms,"‘Even after 30 yrs, procedural issues dog arbitration regime’



NEW DELHI: In an unprecedented step, Supreme Court appears to have vetted a bill pending consideration in Parliament. On Friday, it ""urged"" the law ministry to take a ""serious look"" and make changes in it, keeping in mind the arbitration regime in India.Constitutional courts are empowered to test the validity of laws enacted by Parliament and state legislatures and interpret the law. The Constitution under Article 141 provides that a law declared valid by the SC shall be binding on all courts. But these courts have never entertained a petition challenging the validity of a bill.Though the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, 2024, proposing major changes in the 1996 law on the same subject, was not under challenge before SC, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan decided to scrutinise it. They concluded that the bill suffered procedural lacunae and vacuum similar to the 1996 Act.The bench’s comments came in a case involving arbitration between two parties.Giving a brief background of arbitration laws in India, starting with the 1940 Act, followed by the 1996 Act and the changes proposed to be effected through the 2024 bill, the bench said, “It has been almost 30 years since the 1996 Act has remained in force. Various amendments to the 1996 Act have been made over the years to ensure that arbitration proceedings are conducted and concluded expeditiously. It is indeed very sad to note that even after these many years, procedural issues such as the one involved in the case at hand, have continued to plague the arbitration regime of India.”Writing the judgment, Justice Pardiwala said, “Unfortunately, even the new bill has taken no steps whatsoever for ameliorating the position of law as regards the power of impleadment or joinder of an arbitral tribunal. What is expressly missing in the 1996 Act is still missing in the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, 2024, despite a catena of decisions of this court as well as various high courts, highlighting the need for statutory recognition of such power in order to obviate all possibilities of confusion.”He further said, “We urge the department of legal affairs, ministry of law and justice, to take a serious look at the arbitration regime that is prevailing in India and bring about necessary changes while the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, 2024, is still being considered.”The same bench had raised eyebrows in political and legal circles with its verdict setting a deadline of three months for the President to give assent to bills sent to her by governors, and by suggesting that she might consider it prudent to take the opinion of the apex court to determine the validity of bills.","Supreme court appears to have vetted a bill pending consideration in parliament.

"Pinarayi, Tharoor at Adani event will give many sleepless nights, says PM Modi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pinarayi-tharoor-at-adani-event-will-give-many-sleepless-nights-says-pm-modi/articleshow/120834213.cms,"Left mantri called private investor ‘partner’: PM Modi



The sight of Kerala's Leftist CM Pinarayi Vijayan and Congress MP Shashi Tharoor at an event linked to an Adani project would ""give several people sleepless nights"", PM Modi quipped on Friday at the inauguration of Vizhinjam Port , India's first dedicated transshipment hub, in Thiruvananthapuram. He also took a dig at Kerala CPM's stance on private investment.Referring to state ports minister VN Vasavan calling Adani “a partner”, PM Modi said, “See, a communist minister called a private investor a partner. This reflects the change happening in India.” “I want to tell the chief minister (Vijayan)…you are a strong pillar of the INDI alliance. Shashi Tharoor is also sitting here…,” Modi said, pausing in between to allow his words to be translated to Malayalam for the local audience.When the translator appeared to misinterpret the part about “sleepless nights” as a reference to “issues about Indian airlines”, the PM immediately caught on. “He couldn’t translate it properly. But the message has reached where it should,” Modi said.AICC general secretary KC Venugopal said Modi’s remarks about INDIA bloc and Lok Sabha leader of the opposition Rahul Gandhi — the PM didn’t mention him — were unbecoming of his position. “Let’s see who actually has sleepless nights. It seems the PM got carried away by the excitement of meeting his dearest friend, Adani,” said Venugopal, adding that CM Vijayan could have corrected the PM, but chose not to.Later, Vasavan clarified that he called Adani a partner because the industrialist executed the Vizhinjam Port project initiated by ex-Congress CM Oommen Chandy. “There’s no need to read too much into what I said. It’s a public-private partnership , and as long as the agreement is in place, Adani remains the project partner,” he said.The launch event was overshadowed by friction between CPM and Congress. State leader of the opposition VD Satheesan skipped the event, claiming he wasn’t properly invited. Congress functionaries were also upset that the state govt didn’t acknowledge ex-CM Chandy’s role in the project. They also pointed out the irony of CM Vijayan accusing Chandy of corruption when he was CPM state secretary.","Left mantri called private investor ‘partner’: pm modi.
