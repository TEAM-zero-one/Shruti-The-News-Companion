Elusive warbler spotted in Ladakh after 46-year gap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/elusive-warbler-spotted-in-ladakh-after-46-year-gap/articleshow/122708065.cms,"Elusive warbler

TOI

At an elevation of 3,200 metres, Ladakh’s rugged mountain sweep in the backdrop, a group of five sat huddled and listened intently to the ‘click-clickclick’ captured in a recording. The insect-like call was proof that one of the most elusive bird species they had come looking for was there.Visual proof came soon enough, making July 15 the day when a conﬁrmed sighting of the long-billed bush warbler would be recorded after 46 years, in a thicket in Kargil’s Suru Valley.The last time the bird (Locustella Major) was seen was also in Ladakh in 1979, when a group of birders from Southampton University were on a tour (1977-80) to chronicle avian fauna. Between 1979 and now, one more sighting of the longbilled bush warbler was documented when ornithologist James Eaton spotted it in Naltar Valley of GilgitBaltistan in 2023.The current expedition by ﬁve birders – Harish Thangaraj, Lt Gen Bhupesh Goyal, Manjula Desai, Rigzin Nubu and Irfan Jeelani — was planned speciﬁcally to spot this warbler.Team leader Thangaraj toldthe group “has years and years of experience sighting birds” and “what we are now looking for are ‘lost birds’ – that were spotted decades ago but were never seen since”.This Feb, the group had made another expedition in search of the bird but failed to spot it. “We searched in Gurez and Tulail valleys at altitudes between 2,400m and 2,800m. But it yielded no results, possibly because of altitude mismatch,” Thangaraj said, referring to the Gilgit-Baltistan sighting, which was at a higher reach.After the unsuccessful attempt, the group stepped up research and got in touch with Eaton. It was the Malaysia-based American ornithologist who steered them on the right path – in this case, near terraced ﬁelds surrounded by rumex and gooseberry shrubs at Sankoo in Suru. “The bird was found in a willow amidst terraced ﬁelds. It’s the ﬁrst time it has been seen on a willow, which will now be added to its known habitats,” Thangaraj told TOI .At 3,200 metres, this is also the highest recorded altitude at which the bird has been seen. Classiﬁed as ‘near threatened’ by International Union for Conservation of Nature, long-billed bush warblers were commonly seen in Ladakh and GilgitBaltistan till the 1930s. In the decades since, birding expeditions were sparse. In 2015, Eaton wrote, birder Shashank Dalvi sighted two warblers in Suru, but it was too brief for him to take a picture. “Expansion of settlements combined with climate change, could be pushing the birds to go higher,” Thangaraj said.Pankaj Gupta, a Delhi Bird Society member who was not part of the expedition, said the “rediscovery” of the bird is “nothing short of extraordinary”. “It reminds us how much remains hidden in our fragmented landscapes, and how urgent it is to protect these last remaining pockets of wilderness,” Gupta said.",The long-billed bush warbler was last seen in ladakh in 1979. It is classiﬁed as ‘near threatened’ by international union for conservation of nature.

Calcutta HC acquits three on death row for 2014 murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/calcutta-hc-acquits-three-on-death-row-for-2014-murder/articleshow/122702397.cms,"Calcutta high court

No proof that any of 3 accused was near crime spot: HC

KOLKATA: Three persons awarded death sentence for a murder and incarcerated for the past 11 years were acquitted on Thursday by Calcutta high court, which ruled that the prosecution had failed to conclusively establish their hand in the killing of a 28-year-old woman, whose mutilated body was found at Sealdah railway station in 2014.A division bench of justices Debangsu Basak and Md Shabbar Rashidi held that there was no evidence whatsoever to associate the three accused — the woman’s husband and two others — with the murder.Their presence at the scene of crime at the relevant time has not been proved convincingly, Calcutta HC held. On the morning of May 20, 2014, chopped body parts of Jayanti Deb were found in the parking area of Sealdah station, some wrapped in a quilt and some stuffed into a trolley bag. Investigating the case, Govt Railway Police arrested her estranged husband Surojit Deb, his girlfriend Lipika Poddar and one Sanjoy Biswas. Surojit and Lipika were accused of committing the murder and hiring Sanjoy to dispose of the body.Charges were framed against the three on April 21, 2015. In 2019, a Sealdah court found them guilty of murder, destruction of evidence and criminal conspiracy, and sentenced them to death.The high court bench overturned the verdict. The HC observed that there was “overwhelming evidence” that Surojit had moved out of his marital home with his daughter much before the crime, and was living elsewhere with Lipika. There was absolutely no evidence that any of the three accused was in the vicinity of the crime spot around the date of the incident, the court said, acquitting all three. “The prosecution had hopelessly failed to bring home the charges levelled against the appellants at the trial, beyond all reasonable doubts sufficient enough to secure their conviction,” the bench stated.The trial court order was based on Sanjoy’s ‘confession’, which he later retracted.","Calcutta high court says there is no proof that any of 3 accused was near crime spot.

BENGALURU: In a faux pas, Meta’s auto-translation tool “digitally” killed off Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah while translating a condolence message posted by CMO on social media Tuesday. Understandably furious at being referred to as “late” CM, Siddaramaiah told Meta to suspend its Kannada auto-translation feature until it learns not to distort facts.The condolence message was posted in Kannada on Facebook and Instagram, mourning the death of veteran actress B Sarojadevi. Meta’s English auto-translation, however, read: “Chief Minister Siddaramaiah passed away yesterday multilingual star, senior actress B. Took darshan of Sarojadevi’s earthly body and paid his last respects.”Reacting sharply to the goof-up, Siddaramaiah posted on X: “Faulty auto-translation of Kannada content on Meta platforms is distorting facts and misleading users. This is dangerous when it comes to official communication. My media adviser has formally written to Meta urging immediate correction. Social media platforms must act responsibly.I caution citizens to be aware that translations shown are often inaccurate. Such negligence by tech giants can harm public understanding and trust.”The CMO said it sent a mail to Meta, seeking urgent intervention. The CMO also urged Meta to hit pause button on Kannada auto-translation until it improved the feature further. It also asked the tech company to collaborate with Kannada language experts and professionals “to enhance contextual accuracy” of translations from Kannada to English”.“We have noted with concern that the auto-translation from Kannada to English is frequently inaccurate and, in some cases, grossly misleading,” wrote K V Prabhakar, the CM’s media adviser. Prabhakar cautioned that such bloopers could cause confusion, especially when they involve public communication, official statements or important messages from the CM or govt. “Many may not realise that what they are reading is an automated translation rather than the original message,” he said.","Karnataka cm siddaramaiah told meta to suspend its kannada auto-translation feature until it learns not to distort facts.

I can’t accept payment by UPI anymore,” Shankar, a shopkeeper in Horamavu told ET.According to vendors, lawyers and accountants, thousands of unregistered small businesses, including street food stalls, push carts and corner shops, have received GST notices. Some face demands running into lakhs of rupees.Advocate Vinay K Sreenivasa, joint secretary of the Federation of Bengaluru Street Vendors Associations, said many vendors fear harassment by GST officers and possible eviction by civic authorities, prompting them to switch to cash.Under the current GST framework, businesses supplying goods must register and pay GST if their annual turnover exceeds Rs 40 lakh. For service providers, the threshold is Rs 20 lakh.The commercial taxes department stated that notices were issued only in cases where UPI transaction data since 2021-22 indicated turnover levels that require GST registration. It said such businesses must register, disclose their taxable turnover, and pay the applicable tax.However, HD Arun Kumar, former additional commissioner of commercial taxes in Karnataka, said GST authorities cannot simply quote random figures as turnover. “Under the GST laws, the burden of proof is on officers. They must establish it before arriving at a tax demand, unlike in money laundering cases,” he said.Opposition BJP MLA S Suresh Kumar said he plans to write to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah seeking his intervention.A former GST field official pointed out that not all UPI credits reflect business income. “Some of it would be informal loans or transfers from family and friends,” he said.“Bengaluru may emerge as a test case. If the GST authorities can net a good chunk of revenue by tapping unregistered vendors, other states too will take the cue as every state is desperate for funds,” said chartered accountant Sreenivasan Ramakrishnan of Sreeni & Associates.“Officials have zeroed in on chat vendors with high business in Mumbai. It's only a matter of time considering the huge potential tax base,” he told ET.Karnataka’s tax officials are under pressure to meet a collection target of Rs 1.20 lakh crore for 2025-26.

I don’t have a small clue: MLA Byrathi Basavaraj





BENGALURU: A 44-year-old man with a criminal background was hacked to death by a group of assailants near Halasuru Lake in Bengaluru on Tuesday night, in what police suspect may be linked to a property dispute.The mother of the deceased has filed a complaint naming KR Pura MLA Byrathi Basavaraj and others, alleging they were involved in the murder.The victim, Shiva Prakash alias Bikkalu Shiva, was a resident of Meanee Avenue Road in Hermit Colony, Sivanchetti Gardens, and was a rowdy sheeter at the Bharathi Nagar police station with 11 previous criminal cases against him.Police said a rowdy sheet had been opened in his name in 2006 and that he had recently attended a rowdy parade.According to initial investigations, Shiva was attacked in front of a hotel just a few metres from his home around 8.10pm.He had been speaking with his driver, Imran Khan and another friend, Lokesh, when the assailants arrived.he attack was described by police as extremely brutal, with a senior officer telling The Times of India that Shiva’s “skull was smashed into pieces” and his face left “totally disfigured”.Witnesses dining at the hotel reportedly fled in panic. Police have detained five suspects in connection with the murder and are currently questioning them.Mother names MLA, alleges threats and pressure over landIn a formal complaint, Shiva’s 68-year-old mother, Vijayalaxmi, accused MLA Byrathi Basavaraj, along with Jagadish, Kiran, Vimal, Anil and others, of being involved in her son’s death.She claims the murder was linked to a dispute over property in Kithaganur village, East Bengaluru.According to her statement, Shiva had purchased a property in 2023 and was the GPA (General Power of Attorney) holder. He built a shed on the land and appointed two women as security guards.On 11 February, she alleges, a group led by the accused, including Jagadish and Kiran, forcibly evicted the women and demanded Shiva transfer the GPA rights to Jagadish.She further claimed that Jagadish threatened Shiva, saying he would not be spared if he refused. Despite filing a complaint, Vijayalaxmi said Shiva continued to receive threats and had informed his family that his life was in danger.On 13 July, Shiva told his family he would be attending a friend’s birthday party and wouldn’t return that night.He came back on the afternoon of 15 July, had lunch, and then took a nap.Later that evening, he argued with his driver over a delay in delivering his car keys and instructed him to bring the vehicle immediately.Shortly after 8pm, he was seen speaking to Imran and Lokesh near the hotel.Vijayalaxmi said she noticed her son was no longer there when she returned to the balcony a few minutes later.Hearing commotion, she rushed outside and witnessed eight to ten men attacking Shiva with lethal weapons. She said Imran was also attacked when he tried to intervene, while Lokesh allegedly filmed the assault on his phone.The attackers then fled the scene in an SUV and on two-wheelers.The FIR, registered at Bharathi Nagar police station, names MLA Byrathi Basavaraj as Accused No. 5.The case has been filed under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita sections 103 (punishment for murder) and 190 (offence committed in prosecution of common object by unlawful assembly).Investigation underwayJoint Commissioner of Police (East),B Ramesh, said, “We will know the motive behind the murder once we find out who the assailants are.”Police are examining CCTV footage and continuing to question suspects as part of the investigation.Speaking to the media, MLA Byrathi Basavaraj said, ""I don’t have a small clue or information about the incident. I don’t know who Bikkalu Shiva is, where the property is, or any other details. But without reason, my name was included in the FIR, and I got to know about it through the media. I am deeply pained by the development. I will fight against it legally, and I will be contacting the home minister to explain to him that I don’t have any role. ""As mentioned in the media, the deceased filed a complaint with the police many days ago. Why did no one inform me about it or try to get my clarification? I am not sure if it is a political conspiracy or another reason,"" Basavaraj said. ""I will appear before the police if they summon me for questioning about the case,"" he added. Meanwhile police sources say that the investigating officer may serve him notice at the earliest.","Shiva prakash alias bikkalu shiva, 44, was hacked to death near halasuru lake in bengaluru.

NEW DELHI: A day after Devendra Fadnavis , in a light-hearted comment, invited Uddhav Thackeray to ""come to the ruling side,"" the Shiv Sena UBT chief met the Maharashtra chief minister on Thursday.According to the ANI, the meeting between Fadnavis and Thackeray took place in the office of Legislative Council Chairman Ram Shinde. Their meeting lasted about 20 minutes.On Wednesday, Fadnavis said that Thackeray ""can come to the ruling side in a different way."" While addressing the Maharashtra assembly, the CM said that till 2029, there is no scope for the BJP to come to the opposition side.""At least till 2029, there is no scope for us to come there (opposition). Uddhav Ji can think about the scope of coming to this side (ruling party) and that can be thought about in a different way, but there is absolutely no scope left for us to come there (opposition),"" Fadnavis said.The Shiv Sena and BJP's alliance bloomed till 2014. But, their 25-year partnership hit a rough patch during the 2014 Maharashtra Assembly elections due to a seat-sharing dispute. And finally in 2019, after winning the election, Uddhav ditched BJP and joined hands with Congress.However, Fadnavis had his revenge two and a half years later when Eknath Shinde revolted against Uddhav and split the Shiv Sena. Since then, Fadnavis has been with the Shinde Sena.Eknath Shinde, who served as chief minister for over two years after the 2022 coup, was reluctant to hand over the reins back to Fadnavis in 2024 after their alliance got an overwhelming mandate from the people of the state.Also Read: Can come to the ruling side': Fadnavis offers Uddhav Thackeray, says BJP not going to be in opposition 'at least till 2029 Fadnavis's statement came at a time when Uddhav Thackeray has intensified his attacks on the BJP and the Shinde-led government over the three-language policy, and when speculation about a patch-up between the estranged Thackeray cousins is gaining traction.Speculation has been mounting over the possible collaboration between UBT and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), especially after July 5, when Raj and Uddhav Thackeray shared a stage for the first time in two decades.T he rare show of unity came during a joint celebration of the Maharashtra government's decision to reverse two controversial orders mandating Hindi as a third language from Class 1 in state schools.Back in April, Raj Thackeray had already fuelled talk of a possible thaw, calling their past disagreements “trivial” and stressing that uniting for the cause of the Marathi manoos shouldn’t be difficult. Uddhav Thackeray echoed a similar tone shortly after, saying he was open to reconciliation—so long as it didn’t include those acting against Maharashtra’s interests.","Devendra fadnavis invited uddhav thackeray to ""come to the ruling side"" the shiv sena ubt chief met the maharashtra chief minister on thursday.

You are a mature person, and you understand the relationship you were getting into outside the marriage.""When the advocate said that she was called many times to hotels and rest houses by the man for sex on the pretext of marriage, the bench asked, ""Why did you go to the hotels repeatedly at his beckoning?

CHENNAI: Take legal action against those preventing a person from entering a temple because of his or her caste, Madras high court has directed authorities, stressing that caste-based discrimination cannot be permitted in a country governed by the rule of law.Petitioner Venkatesan moved the court after idols installed by people belonging to scheduled caste (SC) at Ayyanar temple in Pudukudi village in Ariyalur’s Udayarpalayam taluk were vandalised by dominant caste members. He alleged that members of SC were being forced to have a darshan of the deity from behind a large iron gate.“If a temple is permitted to be visited by the public, it assumes the character of a public temple. In such an event, irrespective of the caste or community of the devotees, they must be permitted to offer their prayers to god,” justice N Anand Venkatesh ruled.Recording the submissions, Justice Venkatesh said, “There shall be a direction to district SP and RDO to ensure that all classes of Hindus are permitted to enter the temple and participate in the festival.”",Petitioner venkatesan moved the court after idols installed by people belonging to scheduled caste (sc) at ayyanar temple in pudukudi village were vandalised.

ED’s action part of political witch hunt: Vadra’s office

NEW DELHI: A day after attaching his properties worth Rs 37 crore, the ED on Thursday filed a chargesheet against Robert Vadra, son-in-law of former Congress president Sonia Gandhi , in a Rouse Avenue court here accusing him of laundering “proceeds of crime” in a Gurgaon land deal worth over Rs 58 crore.Besides Vadra, ED has accused 11 others in its chargesheet against the businessman, husband of MP Priyanka Gandhi. The other accused include Onkareshwar Properties and promoters/directors Satyanand Yajee & K S Virk, sources said.The Rouse Avenue court in Delhi is yet to take cognisance of the ED chargesheet against Robert Vadra. This is the second chargesheet filed against the Gandhi family in less than three months. The ED had filed a chargesheet against Sonia and Rahul Gandhi on April 17 in the National Herald money laundering case.Reacting to the ED chargesheet, Vadra’s office said the “present proceedings are nothing more than an extension of the political witch hunt by the present govt”, adding that he would defend and clear his name in court. “As a law-abiding citizen, Vadra has always and will continue to extend his fullest cooperation to the authorities and he is confident that at the end of it all, he will be cleared of any wrongdoing,” the statement said.Vadra is facing multiple money laundering cases for several land deals he negotiated under the then Congress govts in Haryana and Rajasthan, and for alleged favours he had received from the then Congress govt in Haryana led by then CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda . The Hooda-led Congress govt had allowed changes in land use from agricultural to commercial/residential for properties acquired by Vadra, leading to alleged windfall gains for him. Vadra is also facing a money laundering investigation in a case filed against fugitive arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari. He has been accused of allegedly acquiring properties through Bhandari in London and Dubai from the proceeds of crime from multiple defence deals.In the present case in which chargesheet has been filed, Vadra has been accused of purchasing 3.5 acres in Shikohpur village in Gurgaon’s Sector 83 through his Skylight Hospitality Pvt Ltd from Onkareshwar Properties Pvt Ltd on Feb 12, 2008, for Rs 7.5 crore. The then Congress govt in Haryana immediately gave him a commercial licence to develop the property over 2.7 acres. Four months later, the same land was sold to DLF for Rs 58 crore, making a profit of Rs 50 crore within months of purchasing it.ED’s money laundering probe is based on an FIR registered by Gurgaon police in 2018, alleging fraudulent transactions in the land deal. The ED on Wednesday attached 43 properties worth over Rs 37 crore associated with Vadra and his entities, including Skylight Hospitality Pvt Ltd.","Ed files chargesheet against robert vadra, son-in-law of former congress president sonia gandhi.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A 16-year legal battle over toddy strength has ended with Kerala revising the permissible alcohol content in the popular coconut palm beverage to 8.98% v/v, replacing the 2007 cap of 8.1% that triggered prolonged litigation.The decision comes after a SC directive on May 1 last year in a special leave petition filed by Komalan, a former toddy shop licensee.The 2007 limit, imposed citing public health concerns, sparked a legal fight beginning with a Kerala HC writ petition and culminating in the apex court. SC asked the state to conduct a scientific study and revisit its policy. Komalan cited a Kerala University study recommending a 9.59% limit. The state initially rejected that, warning higher levels could indicate adulteration with spirit or arrack. The chief chemical examiner and Bureau of Indian Standards backed the 8.1% cap, while research by Coconut Research Institute’s former director R Child showed toddy could naturally reach 8.1% after 33 hours of fermentation.An expert panel later reviewed samples statewide and global literature. It recommended the 8.98% limit, now adopted. A gazette notification is expected soon. The decision is seen as a boost to the traditional toddy sector.",Kerala revises the permissible alcohol content in the popular coconut palm beverage to 8.98% v/v.

'Blunder at gates'

Poor security arrangement due to cops-organisers nexus

Standard protocols bypassed: Karnataka govt

BENGALURU: The one-man judicial commission constituted by Karnataka’s govt to probe the June 4 stampede outside Bengaluru’s Chinnaswamy stadium that claimed 11 lives has held Royal Challengers Sports Pvt Ltd (RCSPL), which owns and runs RCB, event organisers DNA Entertainment, Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) officials and senior police officers responsible for the tragedy.The Justice D’Cunha Commission found that the organisers failed to obtain mandatory prior permissions — seven days before the event, as required under the Licensing and Controlling of Assemblies and Processions (Bengaluru City) Order, 2009.Meanwhile in the high court, the state govt argued that police officers handling the situation on the day of the stampede had acted like “servants of RCB management”.The Justice John Michael D’Cunha commission, which submitted its report recently, has recommended legal action against three from KSCA: Raghuram Bhat (president), A Shankar (former secretary), and ES Jairam (former treasurer); RCSPL vice-president Rajesh Menon; two from DNA: T Venkata Vardhan (MD) and Sunil Kumar (VP); three IPS officers: B Dayananda, Vikash Kumar Vikash, Shekhar T Tekkannavar; and two more from police department: C Balakrishna and AK Girish.The commission found that the organisers failed to obtain mandatory prior permissions — seven days before the event, as required under Licensing and Controlling of Assemblies and Processions (Bengaluru City) Order, 2009.Pointing out that police security arrangement was grossly inadequate and ineffective, the panel said senior cops were working on ‘bandobast’ under direct command of additional DGP and commissioner of police, “in nexus” with organisers, even before any formal security activation took place.“Out of 515 personnel deputed, only 79 were posted outside the gates to control the crowd. Even these officers were not visible at the venue during the crisis,” it noted.Control room staff failed to alert on-ground security teams stationed at the entry gates. Despite clear signs of overcrowding, the exit gates were not opened in time, which the commission termed “a serious act of negligence and a breakdown of emergency protocols”.The report also flagged improper and unscientific installation of barricades, combined with narrow and constricted entry gates, as a major contributing factor. Under-deployment of police at high-risk gates made the situation worse.It concluded that the organisers themselves triggered the stampede by failing to regulate entry and by making reckless announcements about stadium access.The situation, the commission said, was the result of “hasty decisions and lack of preparation, amounting to recklessness bordering on gross negligence”.The “who is responsible for the stadium stampede” debate took an interesting turn in Karnataka HC on Thursday with the state govt alleging that police officers handling the situation on the day of the tragedy had “acted like servants of RCB management”. However, a suspended IPS officer countered it saying that govt made him a scapegoat.Vikash Kumar Vikash had challenged govt’s decision to suspend him in Central Administrative Tribunal (Bengaluru branch), which recently quashed his suspension and ordered his reinstatement. Referring to CAT’s move, govt told HC that CAT had exceeded its authority by conducting an unnecessary fact-finding mission whilst handling his petition.Special advocate PS Rajagopal, representing govt, noted that police officers acted without proper requisition from RCB management as if they were servants of the entity. Regarding the tribunal’s decision to exonerate Vikash and advise the govt to extend the relief to four other officers, he said it had overstepped its jurisdictional boundaries.He highlighted the unprecedented events of June 3 and June 4, where RCB hastily invited people without proper procedures. He pointed out that police arrangements were made despite lacking necessary permissions, bypassing standard protocols for venue inspection and safety assessments.","The one-man judicial commission has held royal challengers sports pvt ltd (rcspl), which owns and runs rcb, event organisers dna entertainment, karnataka state cricket association (ksca) officials and senior police officers responsible for the tragedy.

Gunmen kill murder convict in Patna hospital,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gunmen-kill-murder-convict-in-patna-hospital/articleshow/122693726.cms,"5 men gun down Chandan Mishra in ICU

No arrests yet, but some men detained for Patna shooting: SP

PATNA: Five men, each carrying a pistol, strolled into a room in a top private hospital here Thursday morning and shot dead a murder convict undergoing treatment on parole and fled without encountering any resistance, the impunity of the execution triggering fresh alarm in a city reeling from a string of killings this July. The last gunman didn’t bother to run; he swaggered off, CCTV footage showed.Chandan Mishra, 36, of was serving a life sentence at Beur central jail for the 2011 murder of a businessman. He was recovering from liver surgery at Paras HMRI Hospital on Bailey Road. His parole was to end July 18.Around 7.15am, CCTV footage captured five men with pistols approaching Room 209 on the hospital’s second floor and firing at close range.Their faces were clearly visible in the footage, now circulating widely on social media. Mishra died of multiple gunshot wounds.A case has been registered. Forensic and canine units were sent to the scene. The body has been sent for autopsy. “Some people have been detained for questioning, but no arrests have been made yet,” Patna SP (central) Diksha said.Mishra had over two dozen cases against him. His 2011 conviction was tied to the murder of businessman Rajendra Kesari.Police said he often declared his intentions openly and had told Kesari, “I will kill you tomorrow,” after he refused to pay extortion money. Kesari was gunned down the next day.Patna SSP Kartikeya K Sharma said preliminary evidence pointed to gang rivalry. “There was a gang called Chandan-Sheru. The manner of shooting suggests a targeted hit by a rival group, possibly over personal enmity or gang war,” he said.Mishra had teamed up with Omkarnath, alias Sheru Singh, to form the Chandan-Sheru gang, which dominated organised crime in western Bihar. Their rise prompted police crackdowns and Rs 50,000 bounties on both men. Power struggles over money and leadership eventually split the gang, with Sheru forming his own faction. Both had clashed when they were inmates at Bhagalpur jail.","5 men gun down chandan mishra in icu in patna's paras hmri hospital.
