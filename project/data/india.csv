A frightening video has gone viral on social media, showing a furious wild rhino attacking a tourist vehicle and nearly overturning it. The incident was recorded in the Salbari Range at Manas National Park in Assam on Thursday.There were no injuries reported however, it caused fear amongst the group of tourists that were attacked.In the video, the rhino can be seen approaching the jeep, which had stopped on a forest path. The animal repeatedly tries to flip the vehicle.Few minutes later, a couple of men were seen chasing the rhino away.During the monsoon season, rhinos often leave their natural habitat seeking refugee from flooded areas and to find better grazing spots. This increases the chances of human-wildlife conflict. Many social media users have raised concerns about the safety of using open jeeps in such areas.There have been frequent rhino attacks on humans but the exact reason behind their aggression is unknown.","Incident was recorded in the salbari range at manas national park in assam.

World's longest hairball removed from teen's stomach at SMS Hosp,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/worlds-longest-hairball-removed-from-teens-stomach-at-sms-hosp/articleshow/121501576.cms,"Photo/Agencies

JAIPUR: The SMS Hospital doctors surgically removed a 210-centimetre-long trichobezoar (a collection of hair) from the stomach of a 14-year-old girl, a resident of Barara village in Agra district of Uttar Pradesh, on Tuesday. It is believed to be the longest trichobezoar ever recorded in the world. The previous record stood at 180 cm.The trichobezoar was entangled throughout the small intestine, which made the surgery a challenging task. Removing it in one piece was a major challenge, as breaking it could have necessitated multiple incisions in the intestines. In the operation, which lasted about two hours, and notably, no blood transfusion was required, the doctors managed to remove trichobezoar in one piece.The girl was brought to the SMS hospital with complaint of abdominal pain and vomiting for over a month. Upon examination, doctors found a hard mass in her abdomen stretching from the stomach to the navel and the upper right part of the abdomen. A CECT (Contrast Enhanced CT scan) revealed a swollen stomach containing an unusual object.The girl was diagnosed with a psychological condition known as Pica, where a person eats non-edible substances. ""She began with ingesting chalk in her school since Class 6, influenced by her peers' behaviour, and later she started eating hair. As we operated upon her, we found wooden pieces, rubber bands, pieces of stones, threads and other non-food items closely packed in the bunch of hair forming a long trichobezoar,"" said Dr Jeevan Kankaria, of surgery department at SMS Hospital,""When we measured, we found it 210 cm long, which is the world's longest trichobezoar ever removed from the stomach of a patient. We will apply for a Guinness World Record for it,"" said Kankaria, who has four Guinness World Records in surgeries.The girl is now receiving treatment in the hospital. She will be discharged soon once the doctors ensure that her condition has improved. The girl is a Class 10 student and belongs to a farmer family.","A 210-centimetre-long trichobezoar (a collection of hair) was removed from the stomach of a 14-year-old girl in uttar pradesh.

Why people kill their partners

The silent suffering of men

NEW DELHI: It begins as it always does. A random look over a room, that brief moment when eyes connect and all else disappears. Late-night texts, words with promises. The romantic whispers of ""forever"" in the night, visions of futures together, lives intertwined. But sometimes, forever isn’t enough. Sometimes, forever ends in a zipped-up body bag - some chopped, some torched, some frozen.Across India, 2025 has seen a gruesome string of murders where wives and their lovers are allegedly turning executioners, transforming homes into horror scenes.In Meerut, Saurabh Rajput was chopped, stuffed in a blue plastic drum, and buried in cement. His wife and her lover reportedly watched him die.In Bijnor, a man was strangled, his wife pinned him down, and her lover crushed his throat. Reason? He didn’t want to move.In Auraiya, two weeks into marriage, the husband was lured, ambushed, and dumped like trash.In Jaipur, a man was burned alive. Flesh melted, and smoke choked the room. His crime? Questioning infidelity.In Korba, a woman confessed to stabbing her husband multiple times.She claimed abuse, but the scene was soaked in rage—blood on walls, a body left in fury.These murders echo an earlier case in Delhi, where Shraddha Walkar’s dismembered remains were found stuffed in a fridge by her live-in partner. A similar horror played out months later in Munirka, where a woman’s body was chopped up and left to rot by her partner.There’s no one pattern, no clear trigger. But there’s always a simmer. A slow erosion. A point where love curdles into control, affection turns into obsession, and murder feels like the only exit.""People are not coming in time to seek advice and help. By the time they do, it's often too late,"" mental wellness experts said unequivocally.They have seen the breakdown happen up close - from honeymoon to homicide.“There is rising infidelity, emotional neglect, and extramarital affairs. By the time couples come for therapy, the relationship has deteriorated to a point of no return,” said Dr Sameer Malhotra, head of mental health and behavioral sciences at Max Healthcare.It’s no longer just women who are speaking up. “Many men come in crying. Some attempt suicide. Some are completely broken, manipulated, or threatened with legal action. They’re unable to function at work, having emotional breakdowns in the office.”And when people choose to kill others, it's not necessarily on the spur of the moment. Sometimes it's horrifyingly deliberate.“For some, the cause is longstanding anger, frustration, and neglect. For others, it’s sadism, psychopathic traits, control, and domination. There’s a complete lack of remorse,” Dr Malhotra said.Experts collectively testified, when someone kills a partner and hides the body, it reflects emotional coldness and the need to erase the person. These acts are not just about fear—they’re about complete annihilation. They said the person might be involved in careful planning — how to dispose of the body, stuff it in a bag, burn it beyond recognition. These aren’t crimes of passion anymore. It’s a calculation.Rashi Sahai, a clinical psychologist, Max Super Specialty Hospital, is seeing the same pattern emerge.""Such killings are often the product of unresolved trauma, emotional neglect, or a broken sense of self. It's not spontaneous. It builds. And then it shatters,"" she said.Sahai listed the red flags. Four D's that nearly always appear prior to it being too late:But even when they're apparent, few take them seriously.Dr Kriti Bhargava, a clinical psychologist, said what drives someone to commit violence is disturbingly simple: “Punishment is immediate. It offers instant gratification. Walking away takes emotional maturity, and most don’t have it.”For many people, violence appears as justice. Particularly when they feel control is slipping.“A wife asserting independence, or a husband cheating, it shakes their core. It becomes about humiliation. Retaliation.”Men and women kill differently, Dr Bhargava explained. Generally, not always, ""Men tend to kill for power, for entitlement, and for humiliation. Women kill when they are threatened, desperate, or have suffered years of abuse.""And yet, society largely overlooks the male victims — men emotionally battered, manipulated, or shattered behind closed doors.Dr Malhotra is adamant: “Rights come with responsibilities. Men are suffering in silence, and that silence is exploding.”So what can be done?""Couples should be counselled, yes,"" said Sahai, ""but it must be supportive, not punitive. Otherwise, it won't work.""""We need to teach people emotional control, conflict resolution, not merely math and science,"" said Dr Malhotra. “There’s a vacuum of coping skills.”Love's not meant to be lethal. But in Indian homes across this country, too often it's becoming a risky game. A game where defeat in an argument might equal the loss of life.“People don’t listen anymore. They don’t try to understand. Relationships are transactional now, not emotional,” Dr Malhotra said.The question is no longer why someone was killed. It’s why no one saw it coming.","A brutal pattern emerges across indian homes. Lack of emotional control and communication is the main reason behind the rise in deadly domestic violence cases.

MUMBAI: A 40-year-old man from Worli has been sentenced to four months of rigorous imprisonment after his pet husky bit his neighbour inside an apartment lift. The man, Rishab Patel, was convicted on charges of voluntarily causing hurt and negligent conduct with an animal.Judicial magistrate Suhas Bhosale, while delivering the verdict, said he would not show Patel ""too much leniency"". Referring to CCTV footage, the judge noted, ""The way in which the accused dragged his pet inside lift shows he is not compassionate towards his own pet. He did not care about the informant, his son and dragged his own pet inside the lift... the act... resulted in injury.""The victim, Ramik Shah, a resident of Alfa Apartment in Worli, was heading down from the fourth floor with his one-and-a-half-year-old son and domestic help. When the lift stopped at the third floor, Patel was standing with his dog. Shah said he requested Patel to wait, explaining that his son was cynophobic (afraid of dogs). However, Patel allegedly ignored the request and did not even allow them to exit. Instead, he dragged his dog into the lift, which bit Shah on his left forearm. After the incident, Shah, his son, and the help exited the lift, but Patel allegedly followed them and challenged Shah to ""do whatever he wanted.""Shah later sought medical treatment and filed a police complaint.During the trial, the prosecution presented oral evidence from the victim, Ramik Shah, and his domestic help, Anuj Singh, who confirmed Patel had forcibly entered the lift with the dog despite repeated requests.The defence pointed to inconsistencies, including a delay in medical treatment and the initial absence of administration of anti-rabies vaccine for the victim. However, the magistrate found the testimonies of both Shah and Singh consistent and credible. ""Only because the witness is servant of the first informant we cannot brush aside his evidence if it is otherwise trustworthy,"" he ruled. Holding Patel's actions as ""voluntary,"" the court fined him Rs 4,000 in addition to sentencing him to jail.","A 40-year-old man from worli has been sentenced to four months of rigorous imprisonment.

BJP Slams Congress Claims Of Modi Govt Planning Special Parliament Session on Emergency Anniversary

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Thursday slammed West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee for allegedly mocking Operation Sindoor by terming it a mere “business of sindoor.”In a social media post on X, BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya accused Mamata of choosing to belittle the valour and sacrifices made in defence of India’s security and honour.""Shame! How low can political pettiness go? Mamata Banerjee has now dismissed Operation Sindoor as merely a “business of sindoor.” This is her true face—mocking sacrifice, patriotism, and the courage of our armed forces,"" Malviya said.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi has safeguarded India with unmatched dedication and resolve. Yet Mamata Banerjee, driven solely by vote-bank politics, chooses to belittle the valour and sacrifices made in defence of India’s security and honour. History will remember who stood with the nation—and who mocked its heroes,"" he added.Earlier in the day, Mamata accused PM Modi of giving the name of 'Operation Sindoor' to the military action against Pakistan post Pahalgam terror attack to ""cash in on it politically.""Reacting to the Prime Minister's speech in Alipurduar, Mamata said, ""Once upon a time, he used to roam around calling himself ‘chaiwala’, next time he called himself a ‘chowkidar’ and now he talks about selling ‘sindoor’ ...Sindoor can't be sold this way. It is the honour and dignity of mothers.”"" The name was given by them. All the names are decided by the central government. The name ‘Operation Sindoor' was given to cash in on it politically.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday launched a fiery counterattack against Prime Minister Narendra Modi , accusing him and his party of politicising national security and undermining the opposition amid the backdrop of ' Operation Sindoor ' and the recent Pahalgam terror attack. Banerjee also claimed the Centre named India's armed forces action on Pakistan 'Operation Sindoor' to attract political attention.Reacting sharply to remarks made by PM Modi earlier in the day during a rally in Alipurduar, Banerjee said, ""What Modi ji said today, we are not only shocked but also very sad to hear this, when the Opposition is representing the country...

You are doing garbage of lies. They loot the country and scoot. It doesn’t look nice to talk in this manner,” she said.Touching upon the sensitivities around 'Operation Sindoor', Banerjee said, “Though I don’t have any comments regarding Operation Sindoor, please remember, every woman has respect.”Her remarks came hours after PM Modi, addressing a rally in Alipurduar, tore into the TMC government, calling it a""Nirmam Sarkar” (cruel government) and accusing it of fostering violence, corruption, and administrative failure.Earlier in the day, the PM listed five major crises plaguing West Bengal under TMC rule - violence and lawlessness, insecurity among women, youth unemployment, rampant corruption, and what he described as ""self-serving politics"" robbing the poor of their entitlements.He also condemned the TMC for skipping the recent Niti Aayog meeting, claiming that the state government was more focused on politics than development.""First is the crisis of violence and anarchy spreading in the society.

NEW DELHI: In a big morale-booster for non-officer ranks in Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), ministry of home affairs has decided to confer on them an honorary rank, one level higher than the existing one, on the day of their retirement. The incentive - approved by home minister Amit Shah for CAPF personnel retiring from the rank of constable up to sub-inspector level - will however not grant them any financial or pension benefits.""This historic decision, taken under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, aims at boosting self-respect, pride and morale of personnel..."" home ministry said in a statement on Thursday.Upon retirement, a CAPF constable, who meets the eligibility criteria, will be conferred the honorary rank of head constable, a head constable that of assistant sub-inspector, an assistant sub-inspector of sub-inspector, and a sub-inspector of inspector upon retirement. In case of Assam Rifles, a rifleman will retire as havildar, a havildar as warrant officer, a warrant officer as naib subedar, and a naib subedar as subedar.To be conferred the honorary rank, CAPF or Assam Rifles personnel must meet all promotion criteria at the time of retirement and have a good and clean service record.

Unnatural sex against wife's will is cruelty: MP HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unnatural-sex-against-wifes-will-is-cruelty-mp-hc/articleshow/121500149.cms,"Representative image

BHOPAL/JABALPUR: Madhya Pradesh high court (HC) held that forcing unnatural sex on one's wife, coupled with physical assault and cruelty, constitutes an offence under IPC section 498A, and upheld an FIR registered by a woman against her husband. The court, however, said the husband cannot be prosecuted under IPC sections 377 or 376 as 'marital rape' is not an offence under the law.Police had registered a case against the accused under IPC sections 377, 323 and 498A which he challenged in HC, contending that unnatural sex with wife is not recognised as an offence in Indian law. Also, 498A is not applicable as no dowry harassment has been alleged in the FIR, he argued.Justice G S Ahluwalia of Gwalior bench, in his order, said, ""Committing unnatural sex with a wife against her wishes and on her resistance, assaulting and treating her with physical cruelty will certainly fall within the definition of cruelty. It is not out of place to mention here that demand of dowry is not sine qua non for cruelty.""The order said, ""From a plain reading of IPC section 498A, it is clear that any wilful conduct which is of such nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or cause grave injury or danger to life, limb, or health, whether mental or physical, to the woman, would amount to cruelty.""It is clear that unnatural sex with wife would not be an offence under section 376 or 377 of IPC, HC said, and quashed this charge in the FIR.""However, since there are specific allegations that whenever the wife resisted the unnatural conduct of petitioner, she was assaulted and treated with physical cruelty, this court is of the opinion that offence under section 498A IPC is made out. Accordingly, this application is partially allowed. Offence under section 377 is hereby quashed. However, FIR in relation to offence under Section 498A and 323 stands,"" the court said.","Madhya pradesh high court upholds an fir registered by a woman against her husband. The court, however, said the husband cannot be prosecuted under ipc sections 377 or 376 as'marital rape' is not an offence under the law. Police had registered a case against the accused under ipc sections 377, 323 and 498a.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121500307,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1154230,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

BUDAUN: An FIR has been registered against all 25 police personnel, including SHO and members of Special Operations Group, posted at Binawar police station here for allegedly framing five men in a fake narcotics case and detaining them illegally in July 2024. The court order to file the FIR followed a plea that said Mohd Mukhtyar, Bilal, Ajit, Ashraf and Tarnveer were arrested on July 28 last year. ""They were detained for two days before being falsely shown as arrested with opium under NDPS Act. All five were sent to jail and remained in custody for a month,"" their advocate said.Their advocate Mohammad Tasleem Gazi said, ""We filed an application under BNSS section 175 in the court of CJM Budaun Mohd Tauseef Raza.

BENGALURU: Karnataka's Congress government is considering sending to the President a bill that proposes reservation for Muslims in civil contracts after governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot returned it a second time, insisting it be forwarded to President Droupadi Murmu.Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement (Amendment) Bill, 2025, provides for 4% reservation to Muslims in civil contracts up to Rs 1 crore, besides quotas for SCs, STs and OBCs (Category I and II-A) in government tenders for goods and services. It was passed by the state legislature in March. Law and parliamentary affairs minister HK Patil had planned to meet senior officials and legal experts Thursday to decide the next course of action, but that meeting was postponed.Senior officials said the government had considered challenging Gehlot's decision in court. However, constitutional experts reportedly advised against legal action, urging the government to pursue alternative routes instead. The issue is likely to be informally discussed during a meeting that CM Siddaramaiah is scheduled to chair on Friday.Gehlot had referred the bill to the President previously following objections from the BJP.The principal opposition party argued that providing reservations based on religion violates constitutional provisions and urged the governor to withhold assent.The government then re-sent the bill to Raj Bhavan without amendment but included detailed explanations justifying its stance and requesting the governor's approval. Gehlot, however, remained firm and sent it back again, reiterating reference to the President.","Karnataka transparency in public procurement (amendment) bill, 2025, provides for 4% reservation to muslims in civil contracts up to rs 1 crore.

Udaipur: Rajasthan governor Haribhau Bagde ignited controversy by claiming Mughal emperor Akbar married a palace maid from Amer, not a princess, challenging centuries of historical consensus and accusing British historians of distorting India's past.Speaking on eve of Maharana Pratap's birth anniversary Wednesday, Bagde said: ""It is said Jodha and Akbar got married and a film was made on the story. History books say the same thing but it is a lie.""Bagde said Akbar's wife was not a royal but the daughter of a maid, and while king Bharmal of Amer arranged the marriage, it did not involve a princess. He cited the absence of any reference to Jodha Bai in Akbarnama, the official record of Akbar's reign, to support his claim.Akbar is historically believed to have married Bharmal's daughter in 1569 as part of a strategic alliance.
