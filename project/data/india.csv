Monsoon arrives early in India: Here's what caused the unusual shift,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/monsoon-arrives-early-in-india-heres-what-caused-the-unusual-shift/articleshow/121392043.cms,"Agency photo

Poll Should the government invest more in weather forecasting systems? Yes, definitely. No, current investments are sufficient.

Why monsoon arrived early?

NEW DELHI: The southwest monsoon arrived in Kerala on Saturday, May 24, eight days ahead of its usual onset date of June 1, marking its earliest appearance on the Indian mainland since 2009, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.This early onset, according to IMD Scientist Neetha K Gopal, aligns with their official forecast which had projected monsoon arrival around May 27, with a margin of four days.“Monsoon onset took place today, 24th May, and it is much ahead of its schedule. Normally, the standard monsoon arrival date in Kerala is 1st June, but IMD has already forecasted that the monsoon will reach early this year,” Gopal told ANI. “The official forecast was 27th May with a model of 4 days. That means the monsoon could reach 4 days before 27th May or 4 days after 27th May. So, our forecast has also come true today.”The early monsoon has not only covered Kerala but also advanced into the Lakshadweep area, the south Arabian Sea, parts of the west-central and east-central Arabian Sea, and some parts of Karnataka and Maharashtra.It has also spread into the remaining areas of the Maldives and Comorin, many parts of Tamil Nadu, and the southwest and east-central Bay of Bengal, along with parts of Mizoram and the north Bay of Bengal.Conditions remain favourable for the monsoon to further advance into central Arabian Sea, Goa, more areas of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, additional parts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and deeper into northeastern states and Sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim over the next two to three days.The early arrival of the southwest monsoon is driven by a combination of favourable atmospheric and oceanic conditions. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), a low-pressure area developed over the Arabian Sea along with a trough line extending across Vidarbha. These systems significantly enhanced moisture inflow and atmospheric convection, accelerating the monsoon's advance over the Indian subcontinent.One of the earliest signs of this accelerated progression was the monsoon’s arrival over the south Andaman Sea and adjoining areas on May 13, well ahead of the normal onset date of May 21. This early advancement helped set the pace for its swift movement toward Kerala.Additionally, neutral El Nino–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions were observed during the period, which typically support a normal or stronger monsoon, unlike El Niño years that often suppress rainfall over India. Another contributing factor may have been reduced snow cover over the Himalayan region, a condition that historically correlates with more vigorous monsoon activity.The advancement is expected to benefit key sectors reliant on the monsoon, such as agriculture, fisheries, and livestock. Favourable monsoons not only help these sectors prepare better for extreme weather and climate change but also validate the economic importance of government investments in weather and forecasting systems.Significant initiatives like the Monsoon Mission and High Performance Computing-based forecasting systems have improved resource management, crop yields, and reduced weather-related losses in recent years.I MD data shows that the last time the monsoon hit the Indian coast earlier than this year was in 2009, when it arrived on May 23. Commenting on the northeast monsoon, B Amudha, head of the Regional Meteorological Centre, said, “At present, we cannot say anything about the performance of the northeast monsoon on the basis of southwest monsoon. Let us monitor the progress, and then we will issue the long-range forecast. ”“The normal date of onset of south west monsoon is June 1. This year Southwest monsoon has set in on 24th May. This is much earlier than the normal onset. If you look at the data from the past 16 years, in 2009, the monsoon set in on 23rd May,” she added.Meanwhile, a depression over the south Konkan coast is expected to move eastward and weaken into a well-marked low-pressure area over the next 12 hours.The IMD has issued red and orange alerts for multiple districts in Kerala over the coming days. On Saturday, red alerts were declared for Kasaragod and Kannur, while orange alerts were issued for 11 other districts including Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, and Ernakulam.The IMD also reported heavy to very heavy rainfall in several parts of Kerala, Mahe, and coastal Maharashtra, as well as isolated heavy showers in South Interior Karnataka, Odisha, Bihar, Madhya Maharashtra, Goa, Uttarakhand, Vidarbha, Saurashtra, Kutch, and Tamil Nadu (including Puducherry and Karaikal) till 8 am on Saturday.“For the next 2 days, we have a red alert in the Nilgiris district. The southwest monsoon primarily affects taluks like Ooty, Kunda...the people here are requested to follow precautions and not venture out unless in an emergency...All the boating activities have been stopped for today, and it may remain like this for the next 2 days,” she told ANI.As the monsoon continues to advance rapidly, officials are keeping a close watch on its trajectory and associated weather developments across the country.","The southwest monsoon arrived in kerala on saturday, may 24, eight days ahead of its usual onset date of june 1.

RJD Chief Lalu Prasad Expels Son Tej Pratap Yadav From Party, Family For 'Ignoring Moral Values'

NEW DELHI: Tej Pratap Yadav's ex-wife Aishwarya Rai broke her silence on a recent controversy where Lalu Prasad Yadav 's elder son made a ""relationship confession"" through a Facebook post before deleting it minutes later.Lashing out at Lalu's move to disown Tej Pratap Yadav, Aishwarya asked: ""If they (Lalu Prasad Yadav's family) knew the whole thing, then why did they get him married to me? Why was my life ruined?""Tej Pratap Yadav revealed on Saturday that he has been in a relationship for the past 12 years, raising eyebrows, as he married the granddaughter of a prominent Bihar politician in 2018 and is currently involved in a legal battle over divorce.Aishwarya further called Lalu's decision to expel his son from the party and family a ""drama"", which has been orchestrated to salvage the possible damage ahead of the impending Bihar elections Lalu Prasad on Sunday expelled his eldest son from the party for six years, citing ignorance of ""moral values"" in his personal life. In a post on X, Lalu said Tej Pratap’s behaviour does not align with the family’s values and traditions.Reacting to Lalu's move, Aishwarya said: ""Now they have suddenly had a social awakening.They are all together. They have not separated... The elections are near, that is why they have taken such a step and created this drama... I got information about my divorce from the media.

I will continue my fight,"" she told news agency ANI.The 37-year-old RJD leader had married Aishwarya Rai, granddaughter of former Bihar chief minister Daroga Rai, in a grand ceremony in 2018. But the marriage did not work out, and within months, Aishwarya left his home, accusing Tej Pratap and his family of mistreatment.The fallout led to a high-profile legal battle and political drama, with her father, former minister Chandrika Roy, quitting the RJD and vowing to fight for his daughter both ""politically and legally"". Their divorce proceedings remain active in the local family court.Both parties continue to make accusations. While Tej Pratap Yadav accused his wife of demanding a large alimony amount, Aishwarya alleged that he had troubling behaviour, claiming he took drugs and privately dressed like a woman.","Tej pratap yadav's ex-wife aishwarya rai breaks her silence on a recent controversy.

Bombay high court halts Mumbai airport's bid to replace Turkey's Celebi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-high-court-halts-mumbai-airports-bid-to-replace-turkeys-celebi/articleshow/121414031.cms,"File photo (ANI)

NEW DELHI: In a temporary reprieve for Turkish aviation firm Celebi, the Bombay high court on Monday directed Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) to hold off on awarding new contracts for ground and bridge handling services at the city's international airport.The interim order was passed by Justice Somasekhar Sundaresan, who said that no conclusive steps should be taken on the tenders until Celebi’s petitions are heard after the court’s summer recess in June, reported news agency PTI.The legal dispute stems from the recent revocation of security clearance for Celebi Airport Services India, a subsidiary of Turkey-based Celebi, by India’s Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS). The security clearance was rescinded earlier this month, citing national security concerns, prompting airports across the country to terminate contracts with Celebi’s Indian affiliates.The move followed diplomatic tensions after Turkey expressed support for Pakistan during India’s Operation Sindoor, a military offensive conducted in response to cross-border terrorism. In the aftermath, Celebi’s Indian operations, including those at key airports like Mumbai and Delhi, came under scrutiny.In Mumbai, Celebi Nas Airport Services India, which handles bridge and ground services, filed three separate petitions challenging both the BCAS's decision and MIAL’s termination of contracts. The company contended that the government’s actions were arbitrary and legally unsustainable. Celebi holds a 59 per cent stake in the joint venture operating at the Mumbai airport.The petitions request the high court to annul the BCAS’s order cancelling its security clearance and to reverse MIAL’s termination of key agreements, including the Bridge Mounted Equipment Service Agreement, Ground Handling Services contract, and the Concession Agreement. The firm also asked the court to suspend the tender process initiated by MIAL on May 17 for selecting a replacement agency.Meanwhile, two other group companies, Celebi Airport Services India and Celebi Delhi Cargo Terminal Management India, have approached the Delhi high court seeking similar relief following cancellation of their airport contracts in the capital.",The bombay high court on monday directed mumbai international airport limited to hold off on awarding new contracts for ground and bridge handling services at the city's international airport.

As per protocol, education department additional chief secretary S Siddharth presented a sapling to the CM as a token of welcome. But what followed caught everyone off guard.With his trademark calm, Nitish accepted the plant, and gently placed it on the officer’s head, drawing stunned silence followed by bursts of laughter from the audience. Siddharth, visibly taken aback, stood still as the chief minister continued, unbothered.The moment quickly went viral, turning into the defining snapshot of the day and reviving public chatter about Nitish Kumar’s unusual public conduct.This isn’t a first. From unexpected outbursts to unpredictable stage antics, Kumar has made headlines for his eccentric style on multiple occasions, drawing both amusement and criticism.Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav has often questioned the seriousness of Nitish’s leadership, and Monday’s episode is expected to fuel fresh barbs from the RJD camp. “This is not how a CM behaves,” a senior RJD leader remarked off the record.While supporters dismissed the act as a “harmless, symbolic gesture,” critics argue it undermines the gravity of state functions.With social media already ablaze with memes and reactions, one thing is certain: Nitish Kumar knows how to keep people talking, even with a plant.","Bihar chief minister nitish kumar stole the spotlight on monday by placing a potted plant on a senior bureaucrat's head during a government function in patna.

DGCA gives nod to Class 12 arts & commerce students becoming commercial pilots in India; seeks ministry approval,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dgca-gives-nod-to-class-12-arts-commerce-students-becoming-commercial-pilots-in-india-seeks-ministry-approval/articleshow/121397712.cms,"Poll Should the DGCA further relax educational requirements for other aviation roles? Yes, it should promote inclusivity. No, maintain current standards.

NEW DELHI: In a major reform, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has given its nod to changing the educational requirements for becoming a commercial pilot in India by proposing to allow class 12 pass outs from arts and commerce streams to also pursue this course. And no longer limit commercial pilot licence (CPL) training to science students alone, as it has been for almost three decades now.The regulator has sent its recommendation to the Union aviation ministry, which after finalising the amendment, will send the same to the law ministry. That ministry is to notify changes in the current rules which, as of now, require a student to mandatorily have physics and maths in class 12 for CPL training. Once cleared, all class 12 pass outs — subject to clearing medical fitness and other tests — will be eligible to become commercial pilots in India.“The DGCA recommendation has been sent to the aviation ministry. Once they finalise it, this ministry will send in to the law ministry to notify the change. When that happens, the change will come into effect,” said a senior official. TOI had first reported the move to allow arts and commerce students to do CPL training in India on April 18, 2025.Since mid 1990s, CPL training in India is open only for science & maths students. Before that, 10th pass (matric) was the only educational requirement for doing CPL here. Senior captains say no country other than India has this requirement. They term it an archaic requirement that needs to go as the level of physics and maths knowledge required by pilots is imparted in junior classes itself. Over the last 30 years, many arts and commerce students were forced to give Class 12 exam for physics and maths from open school to be eligible for CPL training.Aware of the likely spurt in number of students opting for CPL training once this rule is amended, aviation authorities have already started work on improving flying schools in India. The long time for CPL flying along with questionable safety and training standards of many flying schools in India forces a large number of students to head abroad every year to pursue this expensive course.DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai on May 16 directed all flying schools in the country to “maintain a dedicated website for their organisation” which must have updated information regarding several parameters that include, among other things, the minimum and maximum time taken to complete 200 hours of flying; number of aircraft, instructors, designated examiners, availability of ground school & simulator. DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai wants to bring in transparency about flying training organisation (FTOs) so that the information being in public domain based on which students will choose them will make them competitive, safer and student-friendly.On their part, FTOs point out a number of things that DGCA must do to make flying training less painful in India. Becoming a pilot in India is anything but easy — right from training stage to eventually getting a job. Most student pilots come from middle-class families who have taken big loans to give wings to their children’s dreams.Senior pilots have a word of caution for all aspiring aviators. “Even after the expensive CPL traning and endorsement, getting a job can take a long time. If you are planning to become a pilot, the entire family must factor in the financial aspect and the time lag in getting a job after the entire training is complete. The reality is not as rosy as it seems for wannabe pilots.” they caution.","Since mid 1990s, cpl training in india is open only for science & maths students.

NEW DELHI: RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav on Sunday expelled his elder son and former Bihar minister, Tej Pratap Yadav , from both the party and the family, citing repeated misconduct and violations of family values.

BHUBANESWAR: Odisha govt has decided to secure trademark rights for several words and phrases associated with Jagannath Temple in Puri.The decision comes in the wake of a recent controversy over the naming of a newly built temple in Bengal's Digha as 'Jagannath dham'. Odisha objected to the use of the word 'dham', arguing that 'Jagannath dham' refers exclusively to the Puri shrine - one of India's four sacred 'dhams' - and its use elsewhere diluted its religious and cultural significance.""The terms sought to be shielded include 'Jagannath dham', 'shree mandira', 'Purushottam kshetra', 'neelachal dham', 'bada danda', 'mahaprasad' and 'neela chakra',"" Arabinda Padhee, chief administrator of Shree Jagannath Temple Administration, said.The final list of words is being finalised.

HC: Just stopping short of making adverse comment

Calcutta HC has in a recent order sharply criticised a trial court judge for his choice of words in matrimonial disputes, describing these as ""patriarchal and condescending to women"".It also rapped the judge for ""copy-pasting"" the order from his earlier judgments and warned if such instances were repeated, it would impact his service record.On May 22, HC granted divorce to a man on grounds of cruelty, overturning a 2018 order by the additional district judge, first court, at Sealdah. What irked HC was the trial court judge's order rejecting the husband's divorce plea and formulating ""auspicious principles"" for a successful marriage.The husband had filed a divorce plea in the trial court in 2015 alleging that his wife had not visited her matrimonial home since 2012, was refusing to cohabit and meet her marital obligations since 2014, and threatening to initiate criminal complaints against him. While the wife refuted the claims, the HC noted that no evidence was attached. While allowing the divorce suit, the HC noted that the wife had even skipped mediation as suggested by the HC in 2023.The judge's four-point formula for a successful marriage included ""transcendental efforts to keep a perfect relation based on austerity of the spouse for achieving purity of the relation"", ""paying honour to our traditional belief"", ""sincere interest in cultivating fidelity"", and ""unmotivated and uninterrupted urge to completely satisfy each other"".The HC division bench of Justices Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya and Uday Kumar said in its order: ""The entire mindset of the learned trial judge appears to spring from a patriarchal and condescending approach, thereby attributing a condescending role to the husband, to advise his wife properly, and also to condone cruel acts of the wife by trying to 'bridge the gap' between the parties. Such observations have nothing to do with the law on the subject. ""The high court judges said they were ""just stopping short"" of making any adverse comment against the trial judge because that could affect his career.","Calcutta hc has in a recent order sharply criticised a trial court judge for his choice of words in matrimonial disputes.

Nagpur woman's statements raised cops' suspicion about motive of Pak visit

NAGPUR/AMRITSAR: A 43-year-old Nagpur woman who had been detained in Pakistan for nine days after illegally crossing the LoC in Kargil district of Ladakh to meet a ""pastor"" she befriended online now stands accused of spying. A zero FIR has been filed against her in Punjab under the Official Secrets Act.SSP (Amritsar Rural) Maninder Singh said Monday Pakistan Rangers handed over the woman, a former nurse and mother of a 12-year-old boy, to BSF at the Attari border last weekend. Sunita Bholeshwar Jamgade had previously made two unsuccessful attempts to enter Pakistan through Attari. On both occasions, BSF intercepted her.Sunita, a resident of Kabir Nagar in Nagpur's Uppalwadi, is divorced. She had told her family that she knew a pastor in Pakistan with an adopted Muslim name. On May 14, she left her son in a lodge near Hundermaan, a frontier Kargil village, and asked him to wait there till she returned.After villagers informed the police about the stranded boy, he was put in the care of the Kargil Child Welfare Committee.Punjab Police said that although Pakistan Rangers decided not to detain Sunita further, her statements had raised suspicion of a motive that goes beyond meeting an online acquaintance in Pakistan.While Sunita maintained she travelled to Pakistan only to meet the person she was seemingly besotted with, the former nurse couldn't explain how she dodged security amid India-Pakistan hostilities to cross the LoC undetected.Initial findings suggest she traversed unfamiliar mountainous terrain to meet two Pakistani contacts - a man named Zulfikar and the unidentified ""pastor"". Sources in Nagpur Police said that security agencies found in her phone messages hinting at ties that may extend beyond a personal relationship.When she was first stopped at Attari while trying to enter Pakistan in March, the authorities let her off thinking she had a mental health problem. This time, officials suggested, they had enough reason to invoke the stringent Official Secrets Act against her.Nagpur zonal DCP Niketan Kadam said a team from Kapil Nagar police station would bring Sunita back to the city for a thorough probe into her background and possible motive.Kargil Child Welfare Committee chairperson Niyaz Ali said that the Ladakh administration had given it permission to escort Sunita's son back to Nagpur.","Sunita bholeshwar jamgade had previously made two unsuccessful attempts to enter pakistan through attari.

Basavaraju's death due to 'betrayal' by some in core formations: Naxals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/basavarajus-death-due-to-betrayal-by-some-in-core-formations-naxals/articleshow/121422461.cms,"Cops deny Reds' claim Basavaraju was caught alive

NEW DELHI: CPI (Maoist) blamed the death of its chief Basavaraju on betrayal by some within its 'core' Naxal formations active in the Maad area, including the PLGA Company No. 7 that was tasked with his proximate security cover.The statement holding ""compromised elements within"" accountable for the killing of Basavaraju in Narayanpur, issued via its Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC), came even as the Chhattisgarh Police conducted the last rites of the CPI(Maoist) general secretary and seven others on Monday in Narayanpur, citing the ""lack of any clear legal claimant"" to their bodies.CPI(Maoist) also admitted that 28, and not 27, ""comrades"" were killed in the operation, and pointed out mistakes in identification of two slain Maoists by police.TOI had exclusively reported on Monday that the Chhattisgarh Police was not keen to hand over Basavaraju's body to his kin or acquaintances for last rites in Srikakulam in Andhra Pradesh, fearing that a public funeral would glorify the mastermind behind the killing of hundreds of civilians and security personnel.The bodies of the remaining 19 Maoists killed in the May 21 operation by the District Reserve Guard wing of the Chhattisgarh Police were, however, handed over to their family members.The DKSZC statement, dated May 25, and signed by 'Vikalp', blamed the ""compromised"" and ""surrendered"" leaders and cadre of units active in Maad for feeding the Chhattisgarh Police and intelligence agencies with constant updates on Basavaraju's movements over the past six months. ""The cadre from different units in the Maad area turned traitors and would share our secret messages with police. Operations based on their leaks were conducted in Jan and March to get to Basavaraju. Six more surrenders over the past one and half months, including by a top cadre in Basavaraju's security detail, made the job of police easier,"" it said.The CPI(Maoist) press note, while corroborating how DRG personnel cornered Basavaraju by breaching and neutralising his protection team, said the Maoist general secretary was captured alive and then killed, a claim rubbished by Bastar IG P Sundarraj. ""The lie is a face-saver. The statement literally certifies our precise and perfectly-timed strike, how 28 of the 35 Maoists engaged ended up neutralised, and how it were the Maoists who killed a DRG personnel in the 'first round of fire' and another in an IED blast after the operation had ended,"" he told TOI.",Cpi(maoist) blamed the death of its chief basavaraju on betrayal by some within its 'core' naxal formations active in the maad area.

PRAYAGRAJ: Draped in white coats and wielding scalpels, two brothers with only school-level education carved out roles as surgeons in UP's Kaushambi, performing operations inside a self-run hospital where no licensed doctor was in sight. Their bravado ended in tragedy when a six-year-old boy died after they removed a surgical rod from his leg - a procedure they had no legal or medical right to attempt.Vikas Kumar, 26, and Vishesh Kumar, 25, were arrested Sunday evening after investigation into the March death of the child. The boy's father Ram Asre of Siriyawa Kala village had filed an FIR on March 16, accusing the duo of causing his son's death through reckless treatment in a facility masquerading as a hospital.Anmol Hospital operated for nearly four years on Charwa-Manauri road.The facility's registration was in the name of the brothers' elder sibling Sanjay Kumar, a farmer with no medical background. Health authorities sealed it in July last year, but the facility resumed operations.The boy had earlier undergone legitimate surgery at a different hospital after suffering a leg fracture. But when time came to remove the implanted rod, his family returned to the local facility - unaware it was run by two men with class 12 education who never went to medical school. The brothers allegedly promised to arrange for a qualified surgeon but chose instead to perform the operation themselves. When the boy's condition deteriorated, one of the imposters rushed him to another hospital, but he died.The brothers confessed during police interrogation that money motivated their decision to conduct the surgery without expert help.","Vikas kumar, 26, and vishesh kumar, 25, were arrested sunday evening after investigation into the march death of the child.

INDORE: Three students, pursuing nursing and science, died by suicide in Indore Sunday night, allegedly due to difficulties in coping with academic stress. To add to the tragedy, a law student was found dead the previous day. All four were from different campuses and had travelled from their native places to Indore to pursue their dreams.One of the deceased, Lucky Mandoi, had been pursuing BSc at Holkar Science College. He had arrived in Indore Thursday from Alirajpur, to live with his sister, who is preparing for UPSC exams. After investigation, police found no signs of financial or personal distress.
