"DGCA allows HIV+ commercial pilot to fly, but with riders. Will challenge order, he says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dgca-allows-hiv-commercial-pilot-to-fly-but-with-riders-will-challenge-order-he-says/articleshow/119186293.cms,"MUMBAI: A US-trained commercial pilot with HIV on Tuesday told the Bombay HC that Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)'s certification deeming him fit to fly as a commander but only with a more experienced pilot beside him was ""discriminatory."" He now plans to file a fresh petition challenging the rider on his licence only because of his HIV status.""If the petitioner has any grievance of the subsequent developments and the fresh certification... it is for the petitioner to challenge the same as may be permitted in law,"" said Justices Girish Kulkarni and Advait Sethna.The pilot filed the petition last year through his father. In July 2021, a medical test deemed him fit to serve as a pilot in command. He had cleared DGCA exams to become a civil commercial pilot. In Oct 2021, he was informed of the HIV diagnosis and issued a 'temporary unfit for flying' medical certificate. In Dec 2021, DGCA informed him he was 'permanently unfit for flying' as a pilot in command. On appeal, in May 2022, DGCA deemed him 'fit for flying as (co-pilot) only.' Thereafter, he left for the US.DGCA's Dec 18 reply said the petitioner is on anti-retroviral therapy (ART), including medicines which have several adverse effects. It cited the International Civil Aviation Organisation's Manual of Civil Aviation Medicine on the risk of progression of the disease after commencing ART. ""Considering repercussions of disease progress, unpredictable side effects of ART, and frequent monitoring constraints, an aeromedical disposition is made declaring him fit to fly as pilot in command with qualified experienced pilot,"" it stated.DGCA's advocate Piyush Shah said the petitioner applied for medical certificate and ""in respect of that we have allowed him as pilot in command"" rostered along with a more experienced pilot. The pilot's advocates, Bhoomika Vyas and Sangram Chinappa, said if he required a pilot with more flying hours to be alongside, no one would hire him. ""This would render him unemployable,"" said Vyas, adding, ""similarly placed persons, who do not have HIV"" face no such rider on their licence.To the judges' query, Vyas said her client has now returned from the US. The judges said the petitioner's grievance that the DGCA was not considering him because of his status as an HIV+ person ""in our opinion, would stand redressed."" For any other grievance, he must file a fresh petition ""making out a case.""","The pilot filed the petition last year through his father.

'Contract largesse' to kin of Arunachal CM under SC lens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/contract-largesse-to-kin-of-arunachal-cm-under-sc-lens/articleshow/119186183.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday decided to conduct an in-depth inquiry into allegations of Arunachal govt's contract largesse to firms owned by chief minister Pema Khandu's relatives and asked the state to provide details of such contracts for the last five years.Appearing for petitioner NGO ' Save Mon Region Federation ', advocate Prashant Bhushan said numerous contracts worth hundreds of crores of rupees have been awarded to the firms owned by CM's relatives in complete violation of norms of the Union government and that comptroller and auditor general had not carried out a proper auditing of the award of contracts in alleged breach of the rules and regulations.A bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna, and Justices Sanjay Kumar and K V Viswanathan asked the state government to file an affidavit in five weeks giving details of the contracts awarded to the firms owned by the CM's relatives as alleged in the petition.It also asked the Union ministries of home affairs and finance to file detailed affidavits regarding the norms governing the award of contracts to relatives of MPs, MLAs and ministers. It also asked the CAG to give a detailed report on these contracts, which was ordered to be audited by the SC in its Mar 20, 2024, order.The SC on Mar 20 last year had disposed of a 2010 petition filed by another NGO 'Voluntary Arunachal Sena', which was represented by Bhushan, seeking CBI probe into allegations of corruption against Khandu's relatives.

The HC had said, “Religion indeed appears to have been the sole criterion for declaring these communities as OBCs.”During the hearing in SC, West Bengal government had stood by its decision to include 77 castes to the OBC list saying that additions were made after conducting the required elaborate three-tier process, including two surveys and a hearing by backward class commission, but let out that it completed the elaborate process in less than 24 hours in the case of certain Muslim communities.The Khotta Muslim com munity made an application on November 13, 2009, and on the same day the WB Commission for Backward Classes (WBCBC) recommended its inclusion in the OBC list.

Open to ‘fair debate’ on Lokpal jurisdiction over HC judges: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/open-to-fair-debate-on-lokpal-jurisdiction-over-hc-judges-supreme-court/articleshow/119186054.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday created space for a “fair debate” on the contentious issue of anti-corruption watchdog Lokpal assuming jurisdiction to inquire into allegations of taint against high court judges even though the apex court had formed a prima facie view that this would be “dangerous” for independence of constitutional courts.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta protested strongly against Lokpal assuming jurisdiction over high court judges and told a bench of Justices B R Gavai, Surya Kant and A S Oka that the Jan 27 order of the full bench led by Lokpal A M Khanwilkar, attempting to assume inquiry jurisdiction over HC judges, went against the procedure established through SC judgments for dealing with complaints against con stitutional court judges.The bench agreed and said the field was already occupied and a mechanism was in place to deal with complaints against SC and HC judges. Mehta said the Supreme Court should examine only Section 14(1)(f) of Lokpal Act, which formed the basis for Lokpal’s Jan 27 order.Supreme Court Bar Association president and senior advocate Kapil Sibal said the SC, in its 1991 judgment in the Veeraswami case, had made it mandatory to obtain the CJI’s consent before initiation of proceedings against a constitutional court judge. “The law must be clarified to ensure that complaints of this nature (corruption and misuse of office) are forwarded only to the CJI and not to any other authority,” he said.Lokpal’s order had come on a complaint filed by a person accusing an HC judge of influencing an additional district judge and another HC judge who were hearing suits filed by the complainant against a private company.However, Sibal said there was a wider issue involved. “What happens if a person goes to a police station and wants to file an FIR (for a criminal act allegedly committed by an HC judge)? The fundamental issue is whether a complaint can be filed against SC and HC judges outside the mechanism provided under the Constitution and the additions made through SC rulings. The court may have to examine this issue in this case,” he said.The SG said whether a person could go to a police station to lodge an FIR did not fall within the ambit and scope of the issue arising from Lokpal’s Jan 27 order. The procedure for lodging a complaint against a constitutional court judge was provided in the Veeraswami judgment, he said.The bench agreed and said it would examine the issues relating to Lokpal’s jurisdiction to entertain complaints against HC judges. Justice Kant said the proceedings should not appear one-sided and added that there should be an amicus to present the contrary view for a fair debate on the issue. In its order, Lokpal had clarified that it did not have jurisdiction over SC judges. The bench appointed senior advocate Ranjit Kumar as amicus and posted hearing on the matter to April 15.","Solicitor general tushar mehta protested strongly against lokpal assuming jurisdiction over high court judges.

CBI must investigate builder-bank nexus: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cbi-must-investigate-builder-bank-nexus-supreme-court/articleshow/119185877.cms,"Submit builder-bank nexus probe blueprint in 2 weeks: SC to CBI





NEW DELHI: Taking strong exception to real estate firms and banks making “homebuyers cry” by not completing projects on time and forcing them to pay EMIs, SC on Tuesday said a CBI probe was needed to unearth the nexus between them and sought a proposal from the agency on how it intends to conduct the investigation, which could bring many realtors under the scanner.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said the builderbank nexus had created havoc, leaving lakhs of homebuyers suffering and it was ultimately Supreme Court which was coming to their rescue. It said SC was dealing with multiple cases of homebuyers of different projects on a daily basis, and it was not the court’s job.“We will definitely have a CBI probe. That is clear. Thousands of people are crying. We can’t wipe their tears but we can address their issues. Something very effective has to be done in a time-bound manner,” the bench said. It asked CBI to come up with a proposal in two weeks on how to conduct the probe — whether project-wise or area-wise.Considering that the proposed probe against builders and banks would be a huge exercise, bringing virtually the entire real estate sector under the lens, the bench sought the assistance of former Intelligence Bureau chief Rajiv Jain. Court appointed the 1980-batch IPS officer, who is now practising law, as amicus curiae and asked him to file a note on how to proceed in the case.The court was hearing petitions filed by thousands of homebuyers who had booked flats under subvention plans in various housing projects in NCR and alleged that they were being forced by banks to pay EMIs despite not getting possession of their flats because of inordinate delay by developers. Under the subvention scheme, banks disburse the sanctioned amount directly to the accounts of builders, who pay EMIs on the amount till flats are handed over to homebuyers. As builders started defaulting in paying EMIs as per the tripartite agreement, banks initiated action against homebuyers to recover the payments.Realising the fallout of a CBI probe, some financial institutions urged the court not to bring the agency into the picture as it would create instability and requested that RBI be asked to look into the matter. Senior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Ranjit Kumar, appearing for financial institutions, urged the court not to paint all banks with the same brush and said their clients had already placed all information before the bench as sought by it.Singhvi said if a particular builder became insolvent, then the fault did not lie with banks. But the bench questioned how a bank could release money to a builder despite knowing that not a brick was laid at the site.The court made it clear that “no one will be spared” but those who acted fairly should not be afraid of the impending investigation.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, appear ing for CBI, said at the outset that the agency would take the case if the court directed and suggested that the probe could start with investigation into any project in Greater Noida. The court, however, asked the agency to come back with a detailed proposal.SC decided to take stern action after very few builders and banks complied with its order to give details of their projects and loans sanctioned. Out of roughly 40 builders and 30 banks/financial institutions which are party in the proceedings, only nine banks and five builders filed their compliance affidavits. “This blatant disregard and ignorance of the court’s directions, coupled with their reluctance in appropriately assisting the court, hints to wards a possible collusion between builders-cum-developers and banks/financial institutions,” the bench said.The bench had directed the petitioners, builders and banks to furnish the following information regarding different projects — (i) The status and details of payments made by builders to banks or payments by homebuyers to banks/ builders, (ii) The date of offering possession where the project is stated to have been completed, (iii) The current status of completion of the project, (iv) The status of recovery from homebuyers, (v) The amenities advertised by builders at the time of launching projects and the status regarding completion thereof, (vi) The status as to whether the builder-cum-developers had undergone CIRP (under IBC) or any other coercive or non-coercive recovery procedure, and the stage of such proceedings, (vii) Whether homebuyers received any relief from statutory authorities like RERA. If so, the details of such orders were to be furnished.SC had in July last year protected homebuyers and directed that no coercive action be taken against them by banks or builders regarding payment of EMIs and no complaint shall be entertained against them for cheque bounce cases.The aggrieved homebuyers said they were victims of illegal disbursal of loans by banks directly into the account of builders in violation of RBI guidelines, which are statutory in nature.“This is a classic case where one rich man (bank/financial institution) gave money to another rich man (builder). The rich man who received the money (builder) ran away with it without fulfilling his obligations. The rich man who gave the money (bank/financial institution) disbursed it in violation of the law of the land. The poor man (homebuyer) is now made a victim and is pushed into litigation by the bank when he has not received a single rupee. And is deprived of his dream home,” one of the petitions said.","Submit builder-bank nexus probe blueprint in 2 weeks: sc to cbi.

Nagpur violence pre-planned; anger against Aurangzeb coming out after B'wood film: CM Fadnavis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nagpur-violence-pre-planned-anger-against-aurangzeb-coming-out-after-bwood-film-cm-fadnavis/articleshow/119185660.cms,"MUMBAI: Unrest in Nagpur in wake of demonstrations for removal of Aurangzeb's tomb resonated in both the Houses of Maharashtra legislature with CM Devendra Fadnavis terming the violence pre-planned while his deputy Eknath Shinde accused Sena UBT of abandoning the ideals of Balasaheb Thackeray and giving up Hindutva ideology by joining hands with Congress.Fadnavis, who holds home portfolio and hails from Nagpur, told the assembly: ""There were protests in the morning and then there was peace. But in the evening, there was a pre-planned attack in which select homes and establishments were targeted. A trolley of stones was found. Weapons were also recovered.""The CM said 33 cops including three deputy commissioners of police, one of whom was assaulted with an axe, were injured in the violence. ""We will take strong action against those involved. Attacks on police will not be tolerated.""Fadnavis said around 11.30am Monday, VHP and Bajrang Dal held a protest in Mahal area demanding removal of Aurangzeb's tomb. They burnt a grass replica of the tomb. However, a rumour spread in the evening that the replica which was burnt had a cloth cover with a religious text on it. This led to a mob of around 200-250 people gathering after namaz at Attar Road. They raised slogans and police had to use force to control them.While another 200-300 people, with their faces covered and carrying sticks, gathered in Hansapuri area and started throwing stones, the third incident occurred at Baldapura at 7.30pm, the CM said. A group of 80-100 people gathered and attacked cops. He spoke about the film 'Chhaava', which portrays the conflict between Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj & Aurangzeb. ""I'm not blaming any film, but it has fanned sentiments among people and their anger against Aurangzeb is coming out. I appeal to all to maintain calm and respect religious spaces.""While making a statement in the council on the violence, Shinde trained his guns on Sena UBT, saying: ""There was a plan (during MVA regime) to arrest BJP's Girish Mahajan, Ashish Shelar, Pravin Darekar and Fadnavis. I overturned the gameplan and brought Mahayuti to power. You became helpless in your lust for power. You decorated the grave of Yakub Memon (convicted in the Mumbai bomb blasts case) and during Lok Sabha elections showed the Pakistani flag.""Taunting Sena UBT for losing assembly elections and even failing to secure leader of opposition's post in the assembly, Shinde said: ""They gave up Hindutva, and now they are 'na ghar ka, na ghat ka'. Five times I told him (Uddhav), 'Let's form an alliance with BJP.' Why did you go with Congress?""Shinde criticised Maharashtra PCC chief Harshwardhan Sakpal for likening Fadnavis to Aurangzeb and demanded an apology.","Devendra fadnavis: ""there was a pre-planned attack in which select homes and establishments were targeted"" his deputy eknath shinde accused sena ubt of abandoning ideals of balasaheb thackeray and giving up hindutva ideology by joining hands with congress.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119185707,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1490931,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

GHAZIABAD: A day before Holi, a family reported a seven-year-old girl's death to police, and her neighbour was arrested.The allegation was that the girl had eaten ‘kadhi' made by the neighbour, which made her so sick that she never recovered. Shanti Devi, who lives in the Loni border area, was taken into custody and charged under Section 105 of BNS (culpable homicide not amounting to murder).Police sent the seven-year-old's body for an autopsy to determine the cause of death. Was it food poisoning?The report has thrown up answers far more terrible. According to the autopsy, the seven-year-old was sexually assaulted and died of strangulation. With the investigation turning on its head, the complaint itself became the centre of the probe.Yes, Shanti Devi had indeed cooked and sent over ‘kadhi', but all other claims – of the seven-year-old and six of her family members getting diarrhoea after eating it, and the girl dying during treatment at GTB Hospital in Delhi – were found to be fake.On Monday, the seven-year-old's father was arrested as the prime suspect of the rape and murder. The 52-year-old, who has five children, had put together a coverup plan using the other children to build an alibi. Police said he got himself and the other children checked at the OPD of GTB, claiming a tummy infection. They were evaluated and sent home.Ajay Kumar Singh, ACP of Ankur Vihar, told TOI, ""The accused had submitted an application that he didn't want a postmortem of the girl at GTB Hospital, and we have evidence for the same. To frame his neighbour, he filed a complaint at Loni border police station and an FIR was registered against Shanti Devi. She was remanded in judicial custody.""Police will now file an application in court to release Shanti Devi. ""On March 14, postmortem report revealed the child was raped and murdered. That same evening, her last rites were performed by the father. After that, he didn't return home. We arrested him near SRB school on Monday,"" the ACP said.While questioning, the accused, police said, admitted to what he had done. ""He said he was drunk. Around 3am on March 13, his five children and wife were sleeping in one room. He lifted his seven-year-old daughter from the bed and went into another room. He raped her. When she started crying, he strangled her. In the morning, around 7-8 am, he called a friend and told him that his daughter had fallen ill after eating kadhi. They took the minor on a motorcycle to a local clinic. The doctor at the clinic told the family to take her to a hospital. They took her to GTB, where doctors declared her brought dead,"" said Singh.Police said the accused called his other children to the hospital after this and told them to feign sickness. ""They were told to tell the doctors they had a stomach ache,"" said the ACP.Shyam Sunder, who runs the clinic the girl was taken to, told TOI he didn't find a pulse when he checked her. ""The child's father told me he had stomach pain since morning. When I didn't find a pulse, I told him to take her to a hospital immediately, but he insisted that I treat her. He wasted more than five minutes and left my clinic only when I shouted at him to go to a hospital.""An FIR has been filed against the 52-year-old man, a property dealer, at Loni border police station under sections 103 (1) (murder), 65 (2) (rape of a woman under 12 years old) and relevant sections of the Pocso Act. Police will submit a report in court so that Shanti Devi gets released from jail,"" Singh said.Shanti Devi had given kadhi to some other families in the locality as well, but none of them complained of any sickness.","A family reported a seven-year-old girl's death to police, and her neighbour was arrested.

If all Hindus unite, the TMC will bite the dust ... ""West Bengal BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari has once again raised the pitch against Mamata Banerjee 's Trinamool government as the state gears up for the Ram Navami festival on April 6. Suvendu, who had last week announced that around one crore Hindus will participate in over 20,000 processions to be held across the state on Ram Navami, on Tuesday said that any attempts to stop the festivities would be resisted strongly.""The situation in the state will be similar to that of Bangladesh if Mamata Banerjee remains in power. The days of her rule are numbered. Hindus will not accept her blatant appeasement of one community and attempts to crush Ram Navami celebrations any more,"" Suvendu said.""On the day of Holi attacks were carried on Dalits by jihadis in Sainthia. But no action was taken against the perpetrators. Internet services were suspended to cover up the violence against the 'Sanatanis'. Discussion on it was not even allowed in the assembly,"" he claimed referring to incidents of violence in the state during Holi.Suvendu also targeted assembly speaker Biman Banerjee after he did not allow discussion in assembly over a BJP adjournment motion on violence in the state during Holi.The speaker did allow BJP chief whip Shankar Ghosh to read out the first few paras of the motion, but then said that certain other references and contents including the word “Hindus” and “Hindutva”, ""were not appropriate"" for discussion on the floor of the House.""We don't need this anti-Hindu regime. We want to know why the administration kept mum and suppressed the actual incident during a festival like Holi.

""If the BJP assumes power, the Muslim MLAs of the Trinamool Congress would be ""thrown out"" of the assembly,"" the leader of the opposition had said evoking strong reactions.Mamata Banerjee had led the attack against Adhikari and said ""Your imported Hindu dharma is not supported by the Vedas or by our seers. How can you deny the rights of Muslims as citizens? This is nothing but a fraud. You are importing fake Hinduism.""""I have the right to protect Hindu dharma, but not your version of it. Please don't play the Hindu card,"" the chief minister had said in the assembly.""We are a secular, pluralistic nation. Everyone has the right to practice their religion. The duty of the majority is to protect the minority. We must protect our country's sovereignty and secularism. I love all religions, and we condemn any political party's attempts to spread hatred against any community,"" Mamata had added.Festivals in Bengal have been a flashpoint between the Trinamool government and the BJP which is now the main opposition party in the state replacing the Left and the Congress. Mamata Banerjee has long been accused by the BJP of appeasing one community in the state. And with assembly elections in the state due next year, we are sure to see much more agression and emotions on both sides of the divide especially around the festivals.","West bengal bjp leader suvendu adhikari has once again raised the pitch against mamata banerjee's trinamool government. He said that any attempts to stop the festivities would be resisted strongly. ""the situation in the state will be similar to that of bangladesh,"" he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119171217,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1059747,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

SRINAGAR: Chief minister Omar Abdullah fretted Tuesday about “discrimination” in distribution of assets after the 2019 bifurcation of the erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir state into Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh .Lawmakers of Omar’s National Conference (NC) members argue that J&K UT has been given far less assets in Delhi, Chandigarh and other regions. But Omar, speaking in the assembly, vowed to take a reconciliatory route to resolve the issue.“Five years ago, J&K and Ladakh got separated. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana were separated long ago (2014) but they are still engaged in disputes over assets in courts, spending huge amounts of money,” Omar said while responding to a question.The CM made it clear his govt would not go down the Andhra-Telangana path. “We want to resolve asset issues with Ladakh through consensus and through give and take,” Omar said. He acknowledged such a reconciliatory approach might be criticised in J&K and Ladakh but insisted it was the only way to solve it.After the abrogation of Article 370, assets between J&K and Ladakh were apportioned on the recommendations of an advisory committee constituted by the Centre under J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019.A key sticking point has been liabilities of the erstwhile state amounting to Rs 2,504.46 crore and how it should be shared between UTs of Ladakh and J&K. Omar’s govt has taken up the matter with the Union home ministry and Ladakh administration.About properties of the erstwhile state in Delhi, Omar said J&K got far less than Ladakh. “We are working on settling the issue. We have acquired land in Dwarka, where we plan to construct a new J&K Bhawan,” he said.According to the CM, J&K House on Delhi’s Prithviraj Road has vacant land and a new building will be constructed there for visiting MLAs. In Chandigarh, Omar pointed out that the govt already owns a building that will be modified to provide proper accommodation for J&K patients travelling to the city’s PGIMER.","Lawmakers of omar’s national conference argue that j&k ut has been given far less assets in delhi, chandigarh and other regions.

JAMMU: Police arrested a woman pilgrim near the sanctum sanctorum of the cave shrine of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi in Reasi district of Jammu & Kashmir after they found a loaded pistol in her possession.Police identified the accused as one Jyoti Gupta , who claimed she is a retired police constable from New Delhi, who they intercepted with the pistol and six cartridges during routine checks on the intervening night of March 14-15.“The licence for the weapon in the possession of Ms Gupta expired a couple of years ago. Katra police are investigating the case further after registering an FIR,” police said. Police also booked one Sanjay Singh , a pilgrim from Uttar Pradesh, after they found two cartridges in his bag near the same area on Monday.Security remains high in and around the shrine since six pilgrims including a child were killed and 48 others injured in twin explosions set off by terrorists near the Banganga river, 2km from Katra, on way to the Vaishno Devi shrine on July 21, 2003. Security was further tightened around the holy cave shrine after security forces neutralized four terrorists in an encounter in Jammu’s Nagrota on Nov 20, 2020.","Police arrested a woman pilgrim near the sanctum sanctorum of the cave shrine of shri mata vaishno devi in reasi district of jammu & kashmir.

Nasir Aslam Wani, CM Omar’s adviser, accompanied Choudhary.Showkat Ahmad Bajad’s body was found in a decomposed condition on March 16 in a river in Kulgam. Brother Riyaz’s corpse was found nearby on March 13. Showkat and Riyaz had been missing since Feb 13. There is still no trace of Mukhtar Ahmad Awan village, a relative of the brothers who had accompanied them to a wedding in Mir Bazar area of the same district the day all three went missing. The three worked in a brick kiln.The magisterial probe was announced amid allegations by opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that the NC govt was not acting on the issue. PDP MLA Waheed Parra had on Monday described deaths of Gujjars “as part of a pattern”. Parra cited another youth’s suicide after alleged police torture in Kathua last month as well as the latest deaths in Kulgam, saying all should probed as they were tied to one specific community.The home department comes under LG after J&K became a Union Territory following the Aug 2019 annulment of special status under Article 370. Since Omar took oath as CM in Oct 2024, he and his govt have repeatedly pleaded helplessness whenever law and order and security related issues surface.When BJP members created a ruckus recently in assembly over police baton-charge on daily wagers in Jammu, Omar asserted he was not in control of police and asked the MLAs to raise the matter with LG.On Tuesday, adviser Wani said the Omar govt had already appealed to LG Sinha for a judicial probe into the latest case. “Whether in Kathua or here in Kulgam, we don’t know anything (about the exact cause of deaths). That is why we have ordered a magisterial probe,” Wani said. Many MLAs have also pressed for action against cops for allegedly beating up protesting women mourners in Kulgam after Showkat’s body was found on Sunday.","Showkat ahmad bajad’s body was found in a decomposed condition on march 16 in a river in kulgam.

HC also noted that I4C — home ministry’s nodal agency dealing with cybercrimes — has followed up with X and held meetings on the issue, but the microblogging site maintained it is not bound to come on board Sahyog as it has always cooperated whenever authorities reached out. The bench acknowledged that I4C has a grievance against X on grounds that in the past, when requests were made for information about sexual offences against children, no response came from X, which is why X ought to come on board Sahyog.Since, except for X, every other social media entity agreed to be linked to Sahyog, HC said these no longer needed to be part of the proceedings before it and agreed to examine objections by X on the next date in the matter that stemmed from a habeas corpus plea file by a woman trying to trace her missing son.On Tuesday, court observed that as per I4C’s status report, while 38 intermediaries have “onboarded”, 15 intermediaries are in the process. In the case of 35 intermediaries, which include cryptocurrency exchanges, approvals are being obtained.

NAGPUR: Authorities clamped a curfew across 30% of Nagpur Tuesday following clashes in the heart of the city on Monday night after protests demanding the removal of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's tomb from the Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district in Maharashtra.Over 50 people have been arrested and 10 police teams deployed to track down other suspects. Police have filed six FIRs against more than 1,200 people, including members of VHP and Bajrang Dal. A single FIR at Ganeshpeth police station charged 650 people.Tensions remained high but no fresh violence was reported Tuesday. Over 1,000 security personnel fortified sensitive areas while 8,000 were on standby. Police conducted marches in central Nagpur.The riots left at least 70 wounded, two of them critically, and caused extensive damage, with mobs torching two bulldozers and 50 vehicles.Cops in motorbike helmets and an intelligence apparatus that allegedly missed clues to what was coming cut a sorry figure in central Nagpur late Monday as rioters, driven by rumours, outnumbered and overwhelmed them in a one-sided battle that left the Maharashtra city convulsing, report Proshun Chakraborty & Viraj Deshpande.After battling rioters for four hours at Mahal, where the violence originated over a demand to remove Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's tomb from Khultabad in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district, police apparently failed to fortify other communally sensitive localities within a 3km radius. Once the protest against Aurangzeb's tomb triggered rioting, the security establishment appeared ill-prepared to prevent the violence from spiralling.Sources said a police contingent was sent out to tackle the rioters in makeshift protective gear. The ferocity of the attack and the team's alleged lack of preparation left them exposed. ""There was no plan in place to control the mob, with police failing to anticipate the possibility of lanes and alleys turning into battle zones. While the cops were trying to push back stone-pelters, many began vandalising vehicles and shops,"" a witness said.A senior police officer admitted to ""misjudging the situation and failing to predict the mob's movements"".

Heat-linked deaths may rise in Mumbai & other cities: International study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/heat-linked-deaths-may-rise-in-mumbai-other-cities-international-study/articleshow/119173260.cms,"Representative photo

MUMBAI: An international report has found that while nine Indian cities, including Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore, focus on immediate responses to heat waves, long-term interventions remain scarce and, where they exist, are inadequately targeted.""Without efficacious long-term strategies, India is likely to witness a higher number of heat-related fatalities due to more frequent, intense, and prolonged heat waves in forthcoming years,"" cautions the study, co-authored by scholars from Sustainable Futures Collaborative, King's College London, Harvard University, Princeton University, and University of California, Berkeley.Utilising climate models, the study identified nine cities — Bengaluru, Delhi, Faridabad, Gwalior, Kota, Ludhiana, Meerut, Mumbai and Surat — with populations exceeding 1 million (based on the 2011 Census) that are anticipated to experience the most substantial increases in hazardous heat index values, combining temperature and humidity, relative to their recent historical averages.“Mumbai, with its 12.4 million population, is presently experiencing premature and extended heatwaves. Mumbai encounters elevated temperatures in summer and during the post-monsoon period due to heightened humidity. Increased humidity amplifies the heat index value of a locality, potentially diminishing bodily resilience and ability to cope with extreme heat through perspiration. Maharashtra possesses a State Heat Action Plan (HAP), while heat-resilience in Mumbai is additionally guided by the Mumbai Climate Action Plan. The HAP delineates actions to be undertaken by pertinent departments before, during and after a heat wave,"" the report said.The analysis found that while all nine cities implement short-term emergency response measures, crucial long-term actions are either wholly absent or poorly targeted. Essential interventions such as household cooling provision for the most heat-exposed, work-loss insurance coverage, enhanced fire management services, and electricity grid improvements are notably lacking across all cities.“In three cities — Mumbai, Bengaluru, Surat — we found the active, embedded engagement of civil society organisations over extended periods of time had the effect of focusing the bureaucracy on climate action, which suggests that more active civil society involvement is necessary to reduce state capacity deficits,” the report said.","Nine indian cities, including mumbai, delhi, and bangalore, focus on immediate responses to heat waves.
