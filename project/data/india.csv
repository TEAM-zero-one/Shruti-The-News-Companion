'Was invited to speak at IIT Roorkee': Sam Pitroda after Centre dismissed hacking claims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/was-invited-to-speak-at-iit-roorkee-sam-pitroda-after-centre-dismissed-hacking-claims/articleshow/118615173.cms,"Sam Pitroda

NEW DELHI: Indian Overseas Congress chief Sam Pitroda on Thursday clarified that he was invited to speak at an IIT-Roorkee event via video link when, shortly after his speech, a hacker allegedly infiltrated the session and streamed explicit content . His statement came after the Union ministry of education (MoE) denied his earlier claim that objectionable content was played during his virtual interaction with students at ""IIT-Ranchi.""The MoE clarified on Wednesday that there is no IIT in Ranchi and called Pitroda’s statement ""baseless."" It noted that while there is an Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) in Ranchi, the institute confirmed that Pitroda had not been invited to any event, either in person or virtually.Following this, Pitroda posted on X, saying, ""I was invited to speak at IIT Roorkee @iitroorkee during the Cognizant event on February 1, 2025, via Zoom with students and faculty.""""Unfortunately, just minutes after my speech, a hacker infiltrated the video link and began streaming explicit, inappropriate content. We immediately shut down the video and ended the event,"" he said.Pitroda described the incident as concerning, especially in an academic setting, and emphasized the need for strong cybersecurity measures.The MoE had earlier said that Pitroda, during a webcast on February 22, claimed he was speaking at IIT-Ranchi when the session was hacked, disrupting the event with objectionable content.The ministry warned that any attempt to harm the reputation of a premier institution would have legal consequences.""Such a reckless statement seems to be an attempt to malign the image of an extremely reputed institution of the country. This institution has stood the test of time and produced some of the brightest minds in the country.""Unlike such an uninformed person, the IITs' reputation is built on the merit, hard work and achievement of many students, teachers and academia,"" the ministry said.","Indian overseas congress chief sam pitroda on thursday clarified that he was invited to speak at an iit-roorkee event via video link.

'Physically tired and mentally retired': Prashant Kishor's jibe at Bihar CM Nitish Kumar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/physically-tired-and-mentally-retired-prashant-kishors-jibe-at-bihar-cm-nitish-kumar/articleshow/118614804.cms,"Nitish Kumar (left) and Prashant Kishor

NEW DELHI: Political strategist-turned-activist Prashant Kishor on Thursday urged voters to ensure that Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar ’s party, the JD(U), does not win any seats in the upcoming assembly elections. He described Kumar as ""physically tired and mentally retired"" and accused him of staying in power by frequently switching alliances.Speaking to reporters in Patna, Kishor said Kumar had remained chief minister despite the JD(U) having only a small number of seats by shifting alliances. He recalled that Kumar broke ties with the BJP in 2013, later joined the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan in 2015, returned to the BJP in 2017, moved back to the RJD camp in 2022, and then rejoined the NDA last year.""To break this cycle, and to ensure that the arrow (JD(U)'s poll symbol) does not float with the lotus (BJP) nor burn bright with the lantern (RJD), I appeal to the people that they vote in a manner that the JD(U) does not win even one seat. Only then would we be rid of the chief minister who is physically tired and mentally retired,"" Kishor said.Moreover, Prashant Kishor, a former JD(U) national vice president, also criticized the BJP, saying it was using Nitish Kumar as a ""mask"" while holding power. He alleged that the recent cabinet expansion, just months before the elections, was aimed at misusing public money and appeasing certain castes.""Swearing in 7 new ministers 6 months before the term of this government ends simply means that they want to loot the people before tenure of the government ends,"" Prashant Kishor said.Also read: Bihar Cabinet expansion: CM Nitish Kumar allocates portfolios to 7 newly-inducted BJP MLAs Claiming that the people were dissatisfied with both the ruling NDA and the RJD-led opposition, Kishor announced plans for a ""Badlo Bihar Rally"" on April 11. ""We have written to the district administration in Patna, asking for permission to hold the rally on April 11. I wager that the turnout will break all records. Though we also foresee the possibility of the jittery in the ruling dispensation trying to pave hurdles by denying permission,"" he said.Kishor was also asked about recent statements by the chief minister’s son, Nishant Kumar, who has insisted that his father is ""100 per cent"" fit and capable of serving another term. This has led to speculation about Nishant’s possible entry into politics.Responding to this, Kishor said, ""I do not want to say much about Nishant since he is not in public life. But I challenge his father to spell out the names of ministers in the state cabinet without looking at a piece of paper. If Nitish Kumar thus demonstrates his mental soundness, I would give up politics and start working for him.""Recently, Kishor was arrested while on a fast demanding the cancellation of the BPSC exams.","Political strategist-turned-activist prashant kishor urged voters to ensure that bihar chief minister nitish kumar ’s party, the jd(u), does not win any seats in the upcoming assembly elections.

Ekta ka Maha Kumbh: The dawn of a new era,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ekta-ka-maha-kumbh-the-dawn-of-a-new-era/articleshow/118614664.cms,"At Maha Kumbh

The Maha Kumbh has successfully concluded in the holy city of Prayagraj. A grand Mahayajna of Unity has been completed. When the consciousness of a nation awakens, when it breaks free from the shackles of a centuries-old mindset of subjugation, it breathes freely in the fresh air of renewed energy. The result of this was witnessed at the Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh (Maha Kumbh of Unity) in Prayagraj since January 13.On January 22, 2024, during the Pran Pratishtha of Ram Lalla in Ayodhya, I spoke about Devbhakti and Deshbhakti — devotion to the divine and to the nation. During the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj, Gods and Goddesses, saints, women, children, youth, senior citizens and people from all walks of life came together. We witnessed the awakened consciousness of the nation. This was Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh, where the sentiments of 140 crore Indians converged at the same place, at the same time, for this sacred occasion.In this holy region of Prayagraj is Shringverpur , a sacred land of unity, harmony and love, where Prabhu Shri Ram and Nishadraj met. Their meeting symbolized the confluence of devotion and goodwill. Even today, Prayagraj inspires us with the same spirit.For 45 days, I witnessed crores of people from every corner of the country making their way to the Sangam. The wave of emotions at the confluence kept rising. Every devotee came with one purpose — taking a dip in the Sangam. The holy confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati filled every pilgrim with enthusiasm, energy, and confidence.This Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj is a subject of study for modern management professionals, planning, and policy experts. Nowhere in the world is there any parallel or example of this scale.The world watched in wonder how crores of people gathered at Prayagraj at the banks of the confluence of rivers. These people had no formal invitations, no prior communication on when to go. Yet crores of people left for the Maha Kumbh of their own accord and felt the bliss of taking a dip in the sacred waters.I cannot forget those faces radiating immense joy and satisfaction after the holy dip. Women, elders, our Divyang brothers and sisters — everyone found a way to reach the Sangam.It was particularly heartening for me to see the overwhelming participation of India’s youth. The presence of the younger generation at the Maha Kumbh sends a profound message that the youth of India will be the torchbearers of our glorious culture and heritage. They understand their responsibility towards preserving it and are committed to carrying it forward.The number of people who arrived in Prayagraj for this Maha Kumbh has undoubtedly created new records. But beyond those physically present, crores of people who could not reach Prayagraj were also deeply connected emotionally to the occasion. The sacred water brought back by pilgrims became a source of spiritual bliss for millions. Many of those returning from the Maha Kumbh were received with respect in their villages, honoured by society.What has happened in the last few weeks is unprecedented and has laid a foundation for centuries to come.More devotees arrived in Prayagraj than anyone had imagined. The administration had estimated attendance based on past experiences of the Kumbh.Nearly twice the population of the United States participated in this Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh.If scholars of spirituality analyse the enthusiastic participation of crores of Indians, they will find that India, proud of its heritage, is now surging ahead with a new-found energy. I believe this is the dawn of a new era, which will script the future of a new India.For thousands of years, the Maha Kumbh has strengthened India’s national consciousness. Every Purna Kumbh used to witness a gathering of saints, scholars and thinkers deliberating upon the state of society in their times. Their reflections used to provide a new direction to the nation and society. Every six years, during the Ardh Kumbh, these ideas were reviewed. After 12 Purnakumbh occurrences spanning 144 years, obsolete traditions were given up, newer ideas were embraced, and new traditions were created move ahead with the times.After 144 years, in this Maha Kumbh, our saints have once again given us a new message for India’s development journey. That message is Developed India – Viksit Bharat.At this Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh, every pilgrim, whether rich or poor, young or old, from villages or cities, from India or abroad, from the East or the West, from the North or the South, irrespective of caste, creed and ideology, came together. This was an embodiment of the vision of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat that filled confidence in crores of people. Now, we must come together in the same spirit for the mission of building a developed India.I am reminded of the incident where, as a little boy, Shri Krishna revealed a snapshot of the whole universe within His mouth to His mother Yashoda. Similarly, in this Maha Kumbh, the people of India and the world have witnessed the massive potential of India’s collective strength. We must now move forward with this self-confidence and dedicate ourselves towards building a developed India.Earlier, the saints of the Bhakti movement had identified and encouraged the strength of our collective resolve across India. From Swami Vivekananda to Sri Aurobindo, every great thinker reminded us of the power of our collective resolve. Even Mahatma Gandhi experienced it during the freedom movement. Post-independence, if this collective strength had been correctly recognised and harnessed towards boosting the welfare of all, it would have become a great force for a newly independent nation. Unfortunately, it was not done earlier. But now, I am gladdened to witness the way in which this collective strength of the people is coming together for a developed India.From the Vedas to Vivekananda, from the ancient scriptures to modern satellites, India’s great traditions have shaped this nation. As a citizen, I pray that we draw new inspiration from the memories of our ancestors and saints. May this Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh help us move ahead with new resolutions. Let us make unity our guiding principle. Let us work with the understanding that service to the nation is service to the divine.During my election campaign in Kashi, I had said, “Maa Ganga has called me.” This was not just an emotion but also a call of responsibility, towards the cleanliness of our sacred rivers. Standing at the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati in Prayagraj, my resolve became even stronger. The cleanliness of our rivers is deeply linked to our own lives. It is our responsibility to celebrate our rivers, big or small, as life-giving mothers. This Maha Kumbh has inspired us to keep working towards the cleanliness of our rivers.I know that organizing such a massive event was no easy task. I pray to Maa Ganga, Maa Yamuna, and Maa Saraswati to forgive us in case there were any shortcomings in our devotion. I see Janata Janardan, the people, as an embodiment of divinity. In case there has been any shortcoming in our efforts to serve them, I also seek the forgiveness of the people.Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh , I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogi Ji , the administration and the people worked together to make this Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh a success. Be it the state or Centre, there were no rulers or administrators and instead, everyone was a devoted sevak. Sanitation workers, police, boatmen, drivers, people serving food everyone worked tirelessly. The way the people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts despite facing many inconveniences was particularly inspirational. I express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to them and the people of Uttar Pradesh.I have always had unwavering confidence in the bright future of our nation. Witnessing this Maha Kumbh has strengthened my conviction manifold.The way 140 crore Indians turned the Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh into a global occasion is truly wonderful. Moved by the dedication, devotion and efforts of our people, I will soon visit Shri Somnath, the first among the 12 Jyotirlingas, to offer the fruits of these collective national efforts to Him and to pray for every Indian.The physical form of the Maha Kumbh may have culminated successfully on Mahashivratri, but just like the eternal flow of the Ganga, the spiritual strength, national consciousness and unity that Maha Kumbh has awakened will continue to inspire us for generations to come","At maha kumbh in prayagraj, gods and goddesses, saints, women, children, youth, senior citizens and people from all walks of life came together.

Shah was in Chitrakoot in MP's Satna district to pay homage to Jan Sangh neta and Bharat Ratna awardee Nanaji Deshmukh on his 15th death anniversary. Shah also unveiled a statue of Jan Sangh co0founder Deendayal Upadhyay .

Poll How Can Universities Better Prevent Student Harassment? Awareness And Support Programs Stricter Policies And Enforcement

DEHRADUN/PITHORAGARH: In a corner of Bhubaneswar, a hostel room has been emptied. Its door, indistinguishable from the others lining the corridor, remains locked. Inside, the personal touches that once marked the space are gone, leaving no trace of the young woman who aspired to build a future there. Yet, beyond these walls, the name Prakriti Lamsal resonates. In Odisha, where students are protesting. In Kathmandu, among Nepal 's student communities, within govt offices and the PMO.Days after Prakriti's death, her father, Sunil Lamsal, searches for answers while holding onto his belief that India will deliver justice for his daughter. ""Since the era of Ramayan, both countries have maintained the roti-beti ka rishta,"" he told TOI over the phone from Kathmandu on Wednesday. ""I cannot be in Odisha for the entire duration of the probe, but I am confident that the Indian govt will do what it needs to.""Also read: Nepal human rights body seeks probe into KIIT-Bhubaneswar student death The roti-beti ka rishta — a bond of livelihoods and marriages that has long blurred the borders between Nepal and India — has long tied the people of the two countries, Lamsal said, repeating, as if to emphasise a hope. Prakriti, 20, was one such daughter. A third-year computer science student at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), she had left her home in Bhairahawa, 5km from the Indian border at Gorakhpur, to pursue a future in India. She had told them she'll be back as an engineer.The Lamsals had first heard of KIIT through university-led events in Kathmandu. Prakriti's cousins, Anurodh and Siddhant, were also students there; she and Anurodh in computer science, Siddhant in mechanical engineering. Like many international students, she arrived with ambitions — big but not uncommon. A degree. A job. A better life for her family, especially her little brother she doted on.There were two things, Lamsal said, Prakriti cared about the most: becoming an engineer and looking after her nine-year-old brother, Prayas. She adored him. ""She wanted to get him into the best school, to shape his future. She was shy, but always willing to help others. A bright career has been cut short. I have lost my daughter — she wanted to set an example for others to follow. Those responsible should not go unpunished.""Also read: How a Nepali student’s death sparked chaos at Odisha’s KIIT Prakriti had always been quiet, a little reserved, Lamsal said. But at KIIT, she had spoken up. Twice. She had filed two complaints against a fellow student, alleging harassment. The university responded by calling in both students for ""counselling"". But her family was never informed. ""No action was taken,"" Lamsal said. ""A firm action could have saved her.""On Feb 16, two hours before her death, Prakriti called her mother. They talked about studies, family matters. Nothing seemed amiss. ""There was no indication of the anxiety she was carrying,"" her father said. A few hours later, the family got the news.Afterwards, the community of 1,500-odd Nepalese students at KIIT erupted in protests. More than 500 students were allegedly asked to vacate their hostels following the unrest. The Nepalese embassy stepped in, sending officials to assess the situation and provide support. ""If it weren't for them (the students), this may never have come to light,"" Lamsal said.When Nepal's PM K P Sharma Oli spoke to Prakriti's parents on Tuesday, he promised them what little could still be given: attention, intervention, the weight of Nepal's diplomatic and legal resources. ""This news has deeply saddened me. It has brought grief to all of us. We cannot change what has happened. It was an unfortunate event… An investigation is underway,"" he told them over the phone. He placed his faith in Indian authorities. He assured the family that justice would be done.Prakriti's father listened, stifled sobs, then spoke. ""Many Nepali children are studying in India. We do not want such incidents to recur. Our govt must take proactive steps in this matter,"" he said. He thanked the PM, but it was not just gratitude — it was a warning, a plea. Oli repeated what he had said: ""Nepal is watching this case.""There was another phone call. Nepal's foreign minister Arzu Rana Deuba spoke to Odisha CM Mohan Charan Majhi. She used different words but asked for the same thing — an ""impartial investigation, legal action, accountability"". Nepal's National Human Rights Commission, too, sent its own request, urging its Indian counterpart to investigate Prakriti's death and ensure that it would not become just another case file.""We are waiting, watching,"" Lamsal said. ""Nepal is too.""","Prakriti lamsal, 20, was a third-year computer science student at kalinga institute of industrial technology (kiit) she had filed two complaints against a fellow student, alleging harassment.

'I am a born Hindu': Shivakumar's response to critics in party. Should Congress be worried?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-am-a-born-hindu-shivakumars-response-to-critics-in-party-should-congress-be-worried/articleshow/118608323.cms,"Shivakumar vs Siddaramiah in Karnataka

Why should the Congress be worried?

NEW DELHI: Is the Congress staring at a crisis in yet another party-ruled state? Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar 's holy dip at the Maha Kumbh and his visit to Sadhguru 's ashram for Mahashivratri celebrations, where home minister Amit Shah was also present, have raised the hackles of some Congress leaders triggering a row that may leave the grand-old-party worried.Shivakumar has reacted strongly to criticism over his ""spiritual"" pursuits from a section of the party - with one senior leader invoking Rahul Gandhi's name to attack the Karnataka Congress leader.In a hard-hitting post on X, All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary PV Mohan targeted Shivakumar's Coimbatore visit and wrote: ""Thanking for an invitation from someone who mocks RG (Rahul Gandhi), the hope of the nation & aligns with RSS's narratives, while serving as a president of a secular party, it misleads party workers. It is conviction rather than compromise (that) ensures the party's growth. Otherwise, it damages the core.""When asked about objections to his visit from within the party, a combative Shivakumar said: ""I am a Hindu. I am a born Hindu and I will die as a Hindu but I love and respect all religions. Our Congress president's name is Mallikarjun Kharge . Who is Mallikarjuna? It's Shiva only. Should he change his name?""""Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev of Isha Foundation came and invited me (for Shivaratri celebrations in Coimbatore). He is from Mysuru. He is a great man and I admire his knowledge and stature but there are many who criticise him,"" he said.The Karnataka deputy chief minister also had good things to say about the Maha Kumbh organised by the Yogi Adityanath government.""My experience regarding Maha Kumbh was very good. I appreciated the way they organised it. It is not a small job. There might be some problems here and there. Trains may have caused problems. I don't like to find faults. It is very satisfactory,"" Shivakumar said.Earlier, responding to allegations of cozying up to the BJP, Shivakumar had called it a conspiracy against him and had invoked Sonia Gandhi to silence his critics.""The Congress party has the doctrine of taking everyone together. Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru and Indira Gandhi have done the same. I have seen Sonia Gandhi celebrating the Ugadi festival. She has adopted Indianity rather than us. We have such leadership,"" he said countering criticism.In 2023 Shivakumar had lost out to Siddaramaiah for the chief minister's post in a very tight race after Congress's emphatic victory in Karnataka assembly elections. After days of persuasion, he settled for the post of deputy CM while retaining the position of state president. At that time there were reports of a power-sharing agreement under which Shivakumar would have got the top post after two and a half years. However, there was no official confirmation of this.While Shivakumar's supporters have made regular claims about the rotational CM deal, the Karnataka Congress strongman has backed Siddaramaiah to the hilt, especially when the chief minister faced all-round attack over the MUDA land scam. But the fact remains that Shivakumar was a strong claimant for the top post and would want some assurance from the party leadership on it going forward.The Congress did well in the bypolls held last year winning all the three seats where elections were held. Recently the Karnataka Congress president held a meeting with those candidates who had lost the last elections to prepare a blueprint for their victory in 2028. This was perhaps a clear indication of his desire to lead the party in the next elections.It is in this context that Shivakumar's spiritual pursuits could be a message to the party leadership.The Congress has already suffered in several states due to leadership tussle and has even lost its governments.In Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia campaigned vigorously for the Congress in the lead up to the Madhya Pradesh assembly polls in 2018. Following Congress's win, Kamal Nath was chosen as the chief minister. But Kamal Nath couldn't complete his five-year term and had to step down as the chief minister after Scindia and 22 Congress MLAs resigned from the assembly and moved to the BJP.In Haryana, Bhupinder Singh Hooda took complete control of the Congress campaign and in the process several senior leaders were sidelined. Kumari Selja, a prominent Dalit face of the party, objected to this dominance and stayed away for most part of the campaign.In Rajasthan, bittter leadership tussle between Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot made headlines for long. Gehlot refused to accommodate Sachin and his supporters. Eventually, Pilot revolted against Gehlot and was on the verge of quitting the party. However, Priyanka Gandhi then intervened and persuaded him to stay back. The faction-ridden Congress eventually lost the assembly elections to the BJP.In Assam, having led the Congress's campaign successfully in 2011, Himanta wanted to be the chief minister. He was seen as the successor to then chief minister Tarun Gogoi. But then came Tarun Gogoi's son, Gaurav Gogoi, on the political scene disrupted the handing over of the baton.Himanta resigned from the Gogoi Cabinet in July 2014, citing ""family-centric"" politics. He joined the BJP and campaigned for the party for the 2016 assembly polls. The BJP came to power in Assam that year and Sarbananda Sonowal was made the chief minister. Five years later, in 2021 when BJP won again, Himanta was made the chief minister.Clearly, the Congress would not want another state to slip away from its hands because of leadership tussle. While Shivakumar may have needed the support of 113 MLAs to become the chief minister in 224-member assembly, he will need the backing of far less number of MLAs to destabilise the Siddaramaiah government.","Shivakumar has reacted strongly to criticism over his ""spiritual"" pursuits from a section of the party. One senior leader invoking rahul gandhi's name to attack the karnataka congress leader. ""i am a born hindu and i will die as a hindu but i love and respect all religions,"" he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118608696,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-651016,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Mohalla clinic interactions lasted barely 1 min: CAG,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mohalla-clinic-interactions-lasted-barely-1-min-cag/articleshow/118611510.cms,"Image used for representative purposes

NEW DELHI: Doctors at AAP's much-vaunted mohalla clinics were spending less than one minute on consultations with a majority of the patients visiting them. Many of these clinics didn't have basic medical equipment such as pulse oximeters, glucometers, X-ray viewers, thermometers and blood pressure monitoring devices.These startling facts have been revealed in a CAG audit report on revenue, economic, social and general sectors and PSUs.The audit has revealed that 18% of the clinics that were evaluated were non-operational for periods ranging from 15 days to 23 months, primarily because of unavailability of doctors, resignations and de-empanelment. The audit found that 41 of 218 clinics across four districts - North East, South, South West, and West - remained shuttered when the evaluation was carried out. Medical services were significantly affected as 70% of patients who visited the mohalla clinics between Oct 2022 and March 2023 received less than one minute of consultation.The report has also raised serious concerns about the availability of medicines as 74 clinics that were reviewed were found to have failed to maintain complete stocks of the 165 medications listed in the essential drug list (EDL).Supply chain difficulties were particularly evident in medicine distribution with frequent unfulfilled or partially completed orders from suppliers. The audit noted that numerous EDL medicines were either not procured by the central procurement agency or not delivered by vendors despite orders having been placed. Delayed deliveries, ranging from three to six months, further disrupted the clinics’ ability to provide timely care.CAG observed that laboratory services were completely unavailable across Delhi’s clinics from November 16, 2022, to December 14, 2022, with no alternative testing arrangements. After 10 years of AAP’s rule, only 53% of the planned mohalla clinics were established with just 38 facilities added in their second term, falling short of their healthcare goals. AAP administration’s 2015 promise of establishing 1,000 clinics to improve healthcare accessibility remained unfulfilled. The CAG report flagged significant project delays.Despite a budget allocation of Rs 35.16 crore for constructing primary health centres between 2016 and 2023, the administration used only 28% (Rs 9.8 crore) of the allocated funds. By March 2023, directorate general of health services, Delhi govt, had established only 523 clinics, well below the 2017 target of 1,000 clinics.The report has revealed significant deficiencies in essential facilities across numerous mohalla clinics. Out of 81 clinics assessed, various shortcomings were identified: 10 operated without potable water supply, 24 lacked air-conditioning for proper storage of medicines and injections while 21 had no toilet amenities. Six clinics functioned without proper examination tables, 29 were found without fire extinguishers and 12 were inaccessible to differently-abled persons.Furthermore, 20 clinics failed to provide privacy screens for patients during consultations. CAG has pointed out that DGHS had issued an order on Feb 26, 2018, mandating quarterly visits by chief district medical officer’s (CDMO) teams to all mohalla clinics in the district. In Dec 2019, DGHS directed CDMOs to inspect at least one clinic monthly, verifying 10% of OPD entries through patient contact numbers.The monitoring teams were tasked with checking staff punctuality and reviewing various registers, including pharmacy indent, stock and balance, OPD, laboratory and daily consumption. Additional focus areas included proper medicine usage and ensuring all prescriptions carried authorised signatures and stamps from empanelled doctors. The monthly visit reports were to be submitted to the state nodal officer. The audit revealed that only 175 inspections (1.5%) were completed against the required 11,191 inspections of 218 clinics in selected districts between March 2018 and March 2023.","Doctors at aap's much-vaunted mohalla clinics were spending less than one minute on consultations.

Another brick in union wall: 'Harassed' Kerala owner to shut kiln,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/another-brick-in-union-wall-harassed-kerala-owner-to-shut-kiln/articleshow/118611931.cms,".

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Trade unionism has dropped a brick on Left-governed Kerala's claim to ease of doing business, with a 57-year-old woman kiln owner in Parassala on the brink of winding up her venture after even a high court order failed to protect her from harassment at the hands of headload workers.Pushpakumari and her husband Thankappan A, a retired state transport corporation employee, have been running the kiln at Chenkal - ""brick"" in Malayalam - for around six years. She alleges that a group of headload workers owing allegiance to CPM-affiliated CITU and Congress-backed INTUC have been obstructing the business in a bid to extract what she says are unreasonable wages.The couple, hailing from Pazhayakada near Thirupuram, recently moved Kerala high court against the unionised workers and obtained an order barring them from disrupting operations at the kiln. The court also directed police to provide protection to the owners and their business.Pushpakumari said little had changed despite the court's intervention, forcing her to contemplate giving up on her kiln. The defiant workers allegedly tore a copy of the court order in front of police. Last Tuesday, they allegedly didn't allow Pushpakumari's regular staff to work.""Not all headload workers create such problems; it is just a group of men with several criminal cases against them. Our employees load 1,000 bricks for Rs 480, receiving an extra Rs 30 as a bonus. The headload workers demand Rs 800 and more,"" she said.Pushpakumari said several orders were cancelled due to delay in delivery caused by the unionised workers.""The court ruled in our favour, but the workers are politically influential, and even police advised us to compromise for the sake of the business. Some of the more aggressive workers threatened to kill us."" Police said the dispute would be resolved soon. ""We have warned the trade union workers not to create any problem,"" an officer said.Kerala organised a global investor summit recently, where chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan promised to remove all obstacles for industrialists and arrange all facilities required for a start-up ecosystem to thrive. Leader of the opposition V D Satheesan, too, extended support in the interest of the state's economic growth.","Pushpakumari and her husband thankappan a, a retired state transport corporation employee, have been running the kiln at chenkal for around six years.

SC lists riders for arrests by GST and Customs staff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-lists-riders-for-arrests-by-gst-and-customs-staff/articleshow/118611897.cms,"The Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Customs and GST authorities had the power to carry out arrests but could not do so without adhering to the safeguards provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) for personal liberty of the accused.Writing the main opinion, CJI Sanjiv Khanna said the safeguards penned in the Arvind Kejriwal vs Enforcement Directorate judgment relating to arrest under Prevention of Money Laundering Act would apply to arrests under Customs and GST Acts . The court introduced safeguards for those facing charges under these Acts.The SC said officials could not take custody of people for alleged violation of the two laws without informing them of the grounds of arrest and laying out ""reasons to believe"" that he had committed an offence under these revenue laws. It also said a person who apprehended arrest was entitled to seek anticipatory bail .A bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justices M M Sundresh and Bela M Trivedi found force in the argument of the petitioners that assessees were compelled to pay tax as a condition for not being arrested and said this was unacceptable and violative of rule of law.""We would observe that in case there is a breach of law, and the assessees are put under threat, force or coercion, the assessees would be entitled to move courts and seek a refund of tax deposited by them. The department would also take appropriate action against the officers in such cases,"" the bench said.Importantly, the bench upheld amendments in 2012, 2013 and 2019 to the Customs and GST Acts classifying certain offences as cognisable and non-bailable while rejecting the challenge to their validity by as many as 280 petitions. It also upheld powers of Customs and GST officials to summon an assessee while clarifying that mere summoning did not make the person an accused.“The challenge to the constitutional validity, as also the right of the authorised officers under Customs and GST Acts to arrest, are rejected and dismissed with elucidation and clarification on the pre-conditions and when and how the power of arrest is to be exercised,” it said.Reading in the entire arrest procedure under CrPC, along with additional safeguards created by SC judgments, into Customs and GST Acts, the bench said as these two laws didn’t come with complete codes on search and seizure, and arrest, provisions of CrPC would apply unless expressly excluded.Writing the main opinion, CJI Khanna said safeguards it had penned in the Arvind Kejriwal vs ED judgment relating to arrest under PMLA would apply to arrest procedures under Customs and GST Acts. Customs and GST officials now must follow the following procedure — a. The officer must have material in his possession (to effect arrest); b. Based on such material, the authorised officer should form and record in writing, ‘reasons to believe’ that the person to be arrested is guilty of an offence punishable under the concerned Acts; c. The person arrested, as soon as may be, must be informed of the grounds of arrest — and also the doctrine of proportionality (mere questioning will serve the purpose or is arrest essential).SC said, “Courts may employ this fourpart doctrinal test in their examination of the legality of arrest as arrest often involves contestation between the fundamental right to life and liberty of individuals against the public purpose of punishing the guilty.” The bench said unbridled exercise of power to arrest without warrant (for cognisable and non-bailable offence, the police must obtain an arrest warrant from court) could result in arbitrariness and errors in decision-making and such errors made by Customs and GST officials could lead to a frustration of constitutional and statutory rights of the arrested person.","The court introduced safeguards for those facing charges under these acts. Officials could not take custody of people for alleged violation of the two laws without informing them of the grounds of arrest and laying out ""reasons to believe"" that he had committed an offence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118611899,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-804301,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A 26-year-old woman was allegedly raped inside a parked bus at Pune’s Swargate bus depot in the early hours of February 25. The victim, a working woman, was waiting for a bus to return to her home in Phaltan, about 100 km away, when the accused, Dattatray Ramdas Gade , approached her. He falsely told her that the bus to her destination was parked elsewhere and led her to an empty Shivshahi bus inside the depot. After convincing her to board, he followed her inside, where he allegedly committed the crime before fleeing the scene.Maharashtra’s transport minister, Pratap Sarnaik, has ordered a departmental inquiry. Both the Assistant Transport Superintendent and the Bus Depot Manager are under investigation, with instructions for suspension if negligence is found. In response, the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) has decided to replace all security personnel at the depot.The Pune city police have released a poster of the suspect, urging the public to come forward with information.The poster mentions that a case under section 64, 351(2) of 2023 has been registered against the accused.As per the poster, ""A case has been registered under section 64, 351(2) of 2023 and the said case is accused named Dattatray Ramdas Gade, age 37 years, Res. Gunat T. Shirur, Distt. Pune and he is a wanted accused in the registered crime. Information about accused Dattatray Gade Rs. 1,00,000/- (one lakh rupees) will be awarded. The name of the informant will be kept confidential.""Pune City Police have also launched an extensive search operation to apprehend the accused. A total of 13 teams, including eight from the Crime Branch and five from Swargate Police Station, are actively pursuing leads. Teams have also been dispatched outside the district.Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Smartana Patil said, “We have declared a Rs 1 lakh cash award for anyone providing information leading to the accused’s arrest. Our teams are working around the clock.”Also read: Police announce Rs 1 lakh reward for information about the missing accused Pune police utilised drones and canine units in Shirur taluka of Pune district to locate the suspect in the Swargate bus rape case, as pressure intensified, officials confirmed.Working alongside Pune Rural police, authorities launched a search operation in Gunat village's sugarcane fields, following intelligence suggesting Gade's possible presence in the area, the official stated.The operation saw the arrival of numerous senior police officials and over 100 personnel at Gunat village during the afternoon hours, he noted.The team employed drone technology for aerial surveillance of the fields to locate Gade, he added. Additionally, authorities brought in a specialised dog squad to assist with the search efforts in the village, he mentioned.In response to security lapses at the depot, MSRTC has taken immediate measures to enhance safety. The Transport Minister has ordered the replacement of all current security personnel at the Swargate depot.Pramod Nehul, MSRTC’s divisional controller, confirmed that an inquiry is underway to determine how the bus was left unlocked. “All 20 CCTV cameras at the depot were operational, and footage has captured the accused leading the victim into the bus,” he said.Additionally, 23 security personnel have been removed for negligence, and two senior officers are under departmental investigation, TOI had reported.Also read: Two depot officials face probe, 23 guards sacked Dattatray Ramdas Gade has multiple criminal cases, including theft, robbery, and chain-snatching, registered against him in Pune and Ahilyanagar district, news agency PTI reported quoting officials. He was out on bail since 2019 for one of the offences. Past cases have been filed against him in Shikrapur and Shirur police jurisdictions. Police have formed eight teams to capture him. Gade also faces charges in Ahilyanagar. In 2024, a theft case was filed against him, and his brother was questioned by Pune police on Wednesday.The survivor, a medical counsellor, narrated that she had reached the bus stand around 5:45 am when the accused approached her, calling her ‘didi’ (sister) to gain her trust. After falsely claiming her bus was parked elsewhere, he led her to an unlit, empty Shivshahi AC bus.Initially hesitant to enter, she used her phone’s torch to look inside, at which point the accused followed her, bolted the door, and allegedly raped her. CCTV footage captured the accused taking her towards the bus and later fleeing.Following the attack, the woman boarded another bus to Phaltan but later returned to Pune after her friend urged her to report the crime. She immediately approached the police, leading to a formal case registration and the launch of the manhunt.Also read: Traumatised survivor returns to city, goes to police after friend's call Authorities have sent the bus for forensic examination to collect evidence. DCP Patil confirmed that the accused had worn a mask during the assault, making initial identification difficult. However, the police successfully identified him based on other evidence.Meanwhile, police teams conducted searches in Shirur taluka’s sugarcane fields based on a tip-off but failed to locate the suspect.As the search continues, law enforcement officials remain confident of apprehending the accused soon.The National Commission for Women (NCW) has taken suo motu cognizance of the incident and demanded immediate action. NCW Chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar has written to the Director General of Police, requesting an action taken report within three days, along with a copy of the FIR. The NCW condemned the crime, stressing concerns over public safety, especially with the accused still at large. The commission will closely monitor the case and take further action as needed.The incident has sparked widespread outrage, with Opposition parties criticising the Maharashtra government for failing to ensure women’s safety. Protests erupted at Swargate bus stand, led by Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Vasant More and other activists demanding justice.Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar called the crime “shameful, painful, and infuriating,” assuring strict action. State Commission for Women Chairperson Rupali Chakankar streesed the need for self-defence training for women and called for fast-track legal proceedings.Members and officials from the NCP-SCP, under Sharad Pawar's leadership, organised a demonstration on Thursday at Pune's Swargate bus depot, protesting against the recent rape incident and demanding severe punishment for the perpetrator.The demonstrators called for the death penalty for the accused and emphasised the urgent need for enhanced women's security measures.The assault occurred on Tuesday when the victim, a working professional, was awaiting transport to Phaltan, situated approximately 100 km from the location.The perpetrator reportedly misled the victim by providing false information about her bus location, directing her to a stationary MSRTC Shivsahi bus within the depot premises, where he subsequently committed the assault.","A 26-year-old woman was allegedly raped inside a parked bus at pune’s swargate bus depot in the early hours of february 25.

Is Uddhav's Sena cozying up to BJP as Shinde plays guessing game?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/is-uddhavs-sena-cozying-up-to-bjp-as-shinde-plays-guessing-game/articleshow/118603780.cms,"NEW DELHI: The assembly election in Maharashtra is done and dusted. However, there is still never a dull moment in state politics with alliance dynamics and power equations between the many factions on both sides of the divide always at play. The latest in the 'Maha potboiler' is speculations around Uddhav Thackeray warming up to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) amid reports of rival Eknath Shinde's dissatisfaction within the Mahayuti.Uddhav's Sena, a former ally of the BJP who broke away from the alliance in 2014, is now showering praises on Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis . The latest in the list is Tuesday's editorial in Saamana, the Uddhav Sena mouthpiece. The editorial praised CM Fadnavis for ""taking away the powers” of ministers to appoint personal secretaries and officers on special duty (OSDs).The Saamana publication also took a dig at deputy CM Shinde alleging that fixers and brokers were fostered and had a free run during his tenure as CM earlier.The editorial claimed that Shinde had also 'complained' to the top BJP leadership against Fadnavis and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his fight against corruption.Earlier in January, Saamana had also praised Fadnavis for his visit to the Naxal-affected Gadchiroli district. The recent heaps of praises for Fadnavis indicates a fresh approach by Uddhav Sena who had earlier blamed him for splitting Sena by backing Shinde.CM Fadnavis is getting all this applause from the Uddhav faction amid reports rumbling in Mahauti camp and Shinde's discontentment which is said to have started when he was asked to take a demotion and given deputy CM post. Shinde's recent trips to his village, started soon after the Maharashtra assembly election results as the Mahayuti parties tried to chalk out government formation plans, kept raising eyebrows. The BJP, having the biggest winning share, of course, had the upper hand and Fadnavis was appointed the CM.While Shinde has rejected the reports of a rift with the BJP, his actions since the government formation speak otherwise.The appointment of NCP leader Aditi Tatkare and BJP leader Girish Mahajan as guardian ministers of Raigad and Nashik districts, respectively, brought tensions to the fore, with the Shiv Sena leaders expressing unhappiness. Shinde's Sena ministers Bharat Gogawale and Dadaji Bhuse were reportedly neglected for these posts and Shinde had left for his village in Daregaon.Both deputy CMs, Shinde and NCP leader Ajit Pawar, also set up project monitoring cells to track progress of projects in the districts of which they are guardian ministers and those of departments handled by ministers of their respective parties. As the CM already has his ""war room"" for monitoring key projects, this move was seen as both the BJP allies asserting themselves.Despite an existing CM relief fund for patient assistance in Maharashtra, Shinde also recently established a separate medical aid cell. He has consistently avoided participating in several meetings called by Fadnavis, notably skipping the Nashik Regional Development Authority discussion regarding the 2027 Kumbh Mela preparations. Instead, he conducted his own meeting in Nashik, which BJP minister Girish Mahajan did not attend.Following Fadnavis's review of the industries department, led by Shiv Sena minister Uday Samant, Shinde organised a separate assessment. Speculation about deteriorating relations intensified when the home department, under Fadnavis, reduced or withdrew police protection for 20 Shiv Sena MLAs, who had received security following the Sena division in 2022.Meanwhile, Uddhav's Sena while upping its attack on Shinde, has gone soft on BJP.In the 2024 assembly elections , the Mahayuti coalition of BJP, Shiv Sena and NCP won 235 of the 288 seats, with BJP securing 132 alone. Shinde's Sena secured 57 seats and Ajit Pawar's NCP got 41 seats.On the other hand, it was a disappointing show by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) which was hoping for a grand comeback. Uddhav's Sena got 20 seats, Congress 16 and Sharad Pawar's NCP secured 10 seats.The BJP, being the single largest party in Maharashtra, is not dependent on Shinde's party to keep the government afloat. With just 14 seats short, BJP is so close to majority that getting the numbers in its favour may not be difficult for the saffron party. In the numbers game, it actually does not matter to the BJP if it allies with Shinde, Uddhav, or for that matter, no one at all.It will be interesting to see if these moves by Uddhav’s Sena is a genuine case for Fadnavis or if the party is preparing grounds to explore a future tie-up with its former ally.","Uddhav's sena, a former ally of the bjp who broke away from the alliance in 2014, is now showering praises on maharashtra chief minister devendra fadnavis. The latest in the list is tuesday's editorial in saamana, the uddhav sena mouthpiece. The editorial praised cm fadnavis for ""taking away the powers’ of ministers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118603747,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1269700,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin Thursday alleged that attempts by BJP-led Centre to impose Hindi were only a facade and that the real intention was to spread Sanskrit.In his third letter to DMK cadres hitting out at Centre for its alleged plans to impose Hindi, Stalin contended that wherever a three-language formula was adopted, Hindi-Sanskrit had taken precedence. If TN too adopts such a formula, it will end up advancing BJP's Sanskritisation agenda, Stalin alleged.According to him, over 25 languages like Maithili, Braj, Bundelkhandi, Bhojpuri, Avadhi, Kannauji, Garhwali, Kumaoni spoken in various north Indian states were destroyed by Hindi-Sanskrit. Since Tamil fought against direct invasion, BJP wants to impose Hindi-Sanskrit through NEP, he claimed. ""Neither Hindi nor Sanskrit can ever destroy the greatness of Tamil. Fascists have always targeted a people's language and culture to erase their identity,"" Stalin said. He said the fact that Tamil survived without being corrupted by north Indian languages makes it a thorn in the flesh for those in power, forcing them to change their tack.Stalin said Sec 4.17 of NEP clearly promoted Sanskrit at all education levels, relegating Tamil and other languages to secondary status. Only in Sec 4.18, Tamil is mentioned. ""Even that says languages, including Tamil, shall be taught only in addition to Sanskrit.""""Push for a monolithic Hindi identity is what kills ancient mother tongues. UP and Bihar were never just 'Hindi heartlands'. Their real languages are now relics of the past,"" Stalin said.","Tamil nadu cm mk stalin claims attempts by centre to impose hindi were only a facade.

"Science unified Ganga’s three separate streams, restored river’s course",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/science-unified-gangas-three-separate-streams-restored-rivers-course/articleshow/118607566.cms,"NEW DELHI: Maha Kumbh 2025 will be remembered for many things, but one engineering marvel stands out — the unification of the Ganga’s three separate streams into a single, cohesive flow. Through a 2.5-kilometre dredging project , the river’s course was restored, reclaiming land equivalent to 1,000 tennis courts. This first-of-its-kind intervention expanded the Mela premises by 22 hectares, ensuring better organisation and accessibility for millions of devotees.The Ganga had previously shifted its course, splitting into three streams that affected its purity and created logistical challenges for the Kumbh Mela. Officials noted that the uneven riverbed led to the formation of sand islands, making the task particularly complex. “We relied on advanced technology and our expertise in water body management to overcome what initially seemed like an insurmountable challenge,” an irrigation department official said.Anil Garg, principal secretary, irrigation and water resources department, highlighted the scale of the achievement: “This feat of reclaiming land equivalent to 1,000 tennis courts and expanding the Sangam nose to accommodate two lakh pilgrims at a time is unparalleled,” he said.This success was driven by a blend of technology, engineering, and human determination. “The project had to be completed within a two-month window from mid-Oct to Dec 31. We deployed three high-capacity dredging machines — two with a capacity of 250 cubic metres and one with 350 cubic metres — to remove over six lakh cubic metres of sand,” explained Gaurav Chopra, managing director of Cleantec Infra.Chopra also highlighted the unique challenges posed by strong river currents and fluctuating water levels. “To maintain stability, dredgers were anchored to pontoon bridges, allowing continuous 24/7 operations in shifts. Despite setbacks like broken pins and shifting machinery, the team stayed focused,” he said. With guidance from chief minister Yogi Adityanath and strategic input from IIT-Guwahati, an additional dredger was deployed to accelerate the work.The unified flow of the Ganga was successfully achieved just in time for Maha Kumbh 2025, creating a more structured and expansive Sangam area for devotees. This not only enhanced the spiritual experience but also ensured smoother logistics for the event’s large crowds.In addition to merging the streams, the project involved levelling and preparing the ground with five lakh metric tonnes of sand, making the Mela area more accessible. Officials and experts believe this project could serve as a replicable model for managing other water bodies across the country.","The ganga had previously shifted its course, splitting into three streams that affected its purity and created logistical challenges for the kumbh mela.

12 states and counting: Authorities widen probe into 'death insurance' scam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/12-states-and-counting-authorities-widen-probe-into-death-insurance-scam/articleshow/118612668.cms,"Representative image

MEERUT: Trilok Kumar died twice in six months. That is confirmed by official records from two govt institutions. The insurance payout came twice, too.Days after TOI uncovered an elaborate insurance scam originating in UP and running into hundreds of crores - where insurance agents, claims officials, panchayat authorities and even doctors and bank staff conspired and colluded to insure the dying and sometimes the dead - investigators now say the fraud runs deeper than initially thought. They say many more agencies and institutions are involved and that from the initial eight states from which they have nabbed some of the accused, they are now looking at ""12 states and counting"".They cited the case of Trilok Kumar in Delhi as an example. The first time Kumar died, it was cancer. That's what MCD records and receipts from the Nigambodh Ghat cremation office in Delhi showed. A resident of Shaktinagar, Kumar was cremated on June 19, 2024, with an official Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) document listing cancer as the cause of death. That should have been the end of his story. It wasn'tSix months later, an MCD death certificate surfaced, now claiming Kumar had died on Dec 27, 2024, at Govind Ballabh Pant Hospital. This time it was cardiopulmonary arrest. The paperwork was flawless- stamps, seals, signatures. TOI has the documents in its possession.""You can't admit a man who's already dead, run medical tests on him, and then hand over his body - all in a single day,"" said Sambhal ASP Anukriti Sharma, one of the lead investigators in a case that has exposed what police in UP are calling ""one of the most calculated and ruthless insurance swindles"" in recent memory.A senior doctor at GB Pant Hospital said: ""When a patient arrives in the emergency, we do not waste time on formalities. But if scammers convince a patient to provide a false name in exchange for money, with the promise of guaranteed treatment, there is a possibility that the patient may comply.""Sharma added, ""Since PMJJBY does not require thorough nominee verification, fraudsters took out multiple policies, waited 45 days, then forged death certificates to claim payouts. They used different names and took advantage of minimal checks.""Sambhal SP Krishan Kumar Bishnoi said, ""We have arrested 16 people, including women, so far.""","Trilok kumar died twice in six months.
