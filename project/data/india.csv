'Frame charges against Karti in Chinese visa scam',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/frame-charges-against-karti-in-chinese-visa-scam/articleshow/126150988.cms,"Image: IANS

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Tuesday ordered framing of charges against Congress MP Karti P Chidambaram and six others in connection with a visa scam, holding that prime facie, a case was made out against them for criminal conspiracy and illegal gratification. The court, however, discharged the eighth accused, Chetan Shrivastava, after concluding that there was ""no material evidence"" on record against him.CBI had filed a chargesheet in Oct 2024 against Karti and the others, alleging bribery in facilitating visas for Chinese nationals for a power company, Talwandi Sabo Power Limited (TSPL), in 2011, when his father P Chidambaram was Union home minister.Special CBI judge Dig Vinay Singh of Rouse Avenue courts observed that there was enough material to proceed against the Sivaganga MP and six other accused for offences including criminal conspiracy, demand and receipt of bribe, destruction of evidence, and related charges. The judge noted the materials placed before the court pointed to 'coordinated acts' by the accused.Besides Karti, others chargesheeted in the case included his close associate S Bhaskararaman, TSPL and Mumbai-based Bell Tools Ltd, through which the bribe was routed.The court held that at the present stage of framing the charges, the statement of approver Vikas Makharia, who was the associate vice-president of TSPL, had to be accepted at face value and it could be examined during the trial.It further observed that the conspiracy between Karti and Bhaskararaman was evident, based on the evidence collected during the investigation.Tracing the sequence of events, the court noted that Makharia approached Karti through Bhaskararaman in Chennai seeking 800 additional project visas for TSPL, believing that he had access to home ministry.Bhaskararaman dema-nded and received a bribe of Rs 50 lakh. Subsequently, the approver (Makharia) telephonically thanked Ch-idambaram, who affirmed receipt of the amount.The court noted that although explicit words such as ""payment"" or ""money"" were avoided during the call, the acknowledgement was recorded. The court rejected the submissions made by Karti that he had ""not read the emails"" relied upon by the prosecution, or that there was ""no substantiated proof"" of a meeting in Chennai or any telephonic conversation.CBI had registered an FIR in the case in 2022. According to the agency, TSPL, a subsidiary of Vedanta, had outsourced work to a Chinese firm for its 1,980 MW thermal power plant coming up in Punjab. With the project facing penalties because of delays, the facilitation was sought for re-use of project visas, since there was a ceiling on project visas permissible for a company's plant. The FIR said there was no provision for the re-issue of project visas.","A delhi court on tuesday ordered framing of charges against congress mp karti p chidambaram and six others in connection with a visa scam.

Mathura man gets life for raping 13-year-old mentally challenged girl,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mathura-man-gets-life-for-raping-13-year-old-mentally-challenged-girl/articleshow/126150954.cms,".

AGRA: A 34-year-old man from Mathura has been sentenced to life imprisonment for raping a 13-year-old mentally challenged girl. Special public prosecutor Rampal Singh said the incident came to light late on the night of Jan 19, 2024, when the girl’s mother woke up around 2am and found her daughter missing. “The family searched the area and, around 3.45am, spotted the girl walking back home with multiple injury marks and bleeding,” Singh said.The parents immediately took her to the local police station, where her father lodged an FIR against an unknown person under IPC sections 376 (rape), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and provisions of the Pocso Act. A subsequent medical examination confirmed that the minor, who was a Class 5 student at the time, had been raped.Later, in a statement given before the magistrate, recorded under CrpC section 164, the girl identified the accused, a neighbour, and said he had threatened to kill her if she disclosed the incident. Police then scanned footage from nearby CCTV cameras, traced the accused and arrested him three days later.He has remained behind bars since. Police also found that he had at least six criminal cases registered against him, including those related to criminal intimidation and rioting. While delivering the verdict on Monday, the special Pocso court of judge Brijesh Kumar-II in Mathura observed that the crime was “heinous in nature, particularly as it involved a minor with learning difficulties, and warranted the maximum punishment under the law”. It also imposed a fine of Rs 1.1 lakh on the convict, directing that the entire amount be paid to the girl’s family for her rehabilitation.In case of non-payment, the convict will have to undergo an additional year of imprisonment.","A 34-year-old man from mathura has been sentenced to life imprisonment for raping a mentally challenged girl.

JAIPUR: The jolly red suit of Santa Claus ran into Sanatan lines in Rajasthan’s Sriganganagar district. An official order from the additional district education officer cautioned that any private school, including those run by missionaries and Christian trusts, found “compelling” students to dress as Santa for Christmas would face action.“For the past few years, children in schools have been made to dress up as Santa Claus on Christmas Day, even though Sriganganagar district is a predominantly Sanatan (Hindu and Sikh) area,” the order said. “There are very few Christian families here. In such a situation, organising such programmes in schools and putting unnecessary pressure on children is not at all justified.”The order followed a letter sent to the district education office by Bharat-Tibet Sahayog Manch. Its national patron is senior RSS functionary Indresh Kumar. Ashok Wadhwa, the officer behind the order, was unavailable for comment.The education minister’s office clarified that the move did not originate from Jaipur. “No instructions on this issue were issued by the minister or from the state education directorate,” an official from education minister Madan Dilawar’s office said Tuesday. “This decision was taken at a local level.”",Sriganganagar district is predominantly sanatan (hindu and sikh) area.

Cyber thugs posed as wealth mgmt advisors: Former IPS officer in note

PATIALA: Former Punjab Police IG Amar Singh Chahal , 66, is battling for life after a self-inflicted gunshot to the chest at his Patiala home on Monday. Police say he shot himself with his gunman’s licenced revolver.This is the second such incident involving an IPS officer in the region after Haryana ADG Y Puran Kumar shot himself dead with his gunman’s pistol at his Chandigarh home in Oct.A12-page handwritten note found on the scene details how ex-IG Chahal was cheated of Rs 8.1 crore in a “highly sophisticated” online investment fraud that operated through WhatsApp and Telegram under the name ‘F-777 DBS Wealth Equity Research Group’. It falsely claimed regulatory approvals and links with well-known financial institutions, the note says.Police are investigating the allegations. It’s a disturbing indicator of how deeply such scams have penetrated society and can trap even those who are seemingly aware of the baits and lures.Patiala SP Palwinder Singh Cheema said one of Chahal’s friends alerted police that he may have attempted suicide after getting a message from him.A police team rushed to his house in ‘26-Acre’ locality around 1.45pm and found him unconscious, with a bullet wound to the chest. A revolver lay close by. He was breathing, say police sources. Chahal’s son and daughter-in-law were in another room during the incident, say police.“Chahal is undergoing treatment in hospital and his condition is critical,” said Patiala SSP Varun Sharma. Late evening, Cheema said Chahal had undergone surgery and was on recovery mode but the next 24 hours will be crucial. “Our immediate priority is his treatment. We are also preserving evidence and examining the allegations mentioned in the note,” said Cheema.Police said Chahal, a 1990batch IPS officer, had not filed any complaint regarding the alleged fraud. According to officials who have seen the note, Chahal wrote that he was cheated by cyber criminals who posed as wealth management advisors.Chahal describes in the note how fraudsters posing as ‘senior executives and advisors’ of the firm gradually gained the confidence of investors by offering daily market tips, simulated dashboards and purportedly highreturn investment products. He alleged that the scheme progressed through multiple stages — daily trading, initial public offerings, over-thecounter trades and so-called quantitative funds — each promising escalating returns.Chahal claimed that as confidence grew, investors were encouraged to deposit larger sums while “planted participants” vouched for the scheme’s authenticity whenever doubts were raised. But when he sought to withdraw funds, he was asked to pay hefty service charges, taxes and membership fees, and was even coaxed into paying an alleged bribe to expedite withdrawals, says the note. Despite making repeated payments, no money was released.The former IG said that he had written to the Prime Minister, Union home minister and Union finance minister, seeking intervention. He urged authorities to constitute an SIT or hand the case to a central agency, arguing that only a specialised probe could “dismantle what the nationwide cyber-fraud network”.He has listed multiple bank accounts through which transfers were allegedly made and claimed that while about Rs 1 crore was his own money, more than Rs 7 crore was borrowed from friends and relatives. In his note, he expressed deep remorse and fear about the financial and emotional impact on his family, while repeatedly stating that no one else should be held responsible for his actions.The note also appealed for protection and assistance for his family and requested that creditors refrain from pressuring them.Chahal had preserved screenshots of dashboards, transaction records and chat histories, which he referenced in the note. Investigators are tracing the alleged transactions and examining the digital evidence he cited.Residents of Patiala and former colleagues described Chahal as a capable officer, who empathised with farmers’ issues and concerns of the Sikh community.","Former punjab police ig amar singh chahal, 66, is battling for life after a self-inflicted gunshot to the chest at his patiala home on monday.

NEW DELHI: The sister of the Unnao rape survivor on Tuesday criticised the Delhi high court for granting bail to convict and former BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar and suspending his life sentence in the case.The woman alleged that Sengar’s release would endanger her family’s lives.""I am not happy about this. He killed my uncle and then my father. Then this incident happened with my sister. He has been released, but we're still in danger. He killed my uncle and then my father. He (Sengar) has been released, but we're still in danger,"" she told news agency ANI.The woman added that while the court may have released Sengar, it should at least put her family behind bars for their “safety.”“My sister is in distress. If something happens to my family, will the court take responsibility? I have a brother—who knows what they might do to him? Many of his men are roaming around outside, threatening us. If we dare file a police complaint, they will kill us. That is why we do not leave our home out of fear,” she said.Earlier on Tuesday, a Delhi high court bench comprising Justices Subramonium Prasad and Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar granted conditional bail to Kuldeep Singh Sengar and suspended his sentence for the duration of the pendency of his appeal challenging his December 2019 conviction and life sentence by a trial court.The conditions of his bail include furnishing a Rs 15-lakh personal bond with three sureties of the same amount, not entering within a five-kilometre radius of the survivor’s residence, and refraining from threatening or influencing her or her mother.On August 1, 2019, over two years after the ghastly June 2017 crime, the Supreme Court had transferred the rape case and other related matters from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi.Sengar’s appeal against his conviction in the case relating to the custodial death of the survivor’s father is also pending before the high court. He was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment in that case and has sought suspension of the sentence, citing the substantial time he has already spent in jail.","Sister of unnao rape survivor criticises delhi high court for granting bail to kuldeep singh sengar.

NEW DELHI: Fresh violence was reported from Assam’s trouble-torn Karbi Anglong district for a second consecutive day on Tuesday, with at least eight people injured as a clash between two groups of protestors prompted police to resort to lathi-charge and tear-gas shelling to disperse them, officials said.In response, the state government temporarily suspended internet services in Karbi Anglong and West Karbi Anglong districts.The clash broke out after a group, including women and children whose shops were burnt by a mob on Monday, came out to protest against the initial violence. Meanwhile, agitators demanding the eviction of encroachers from the tribal belt also gathered in the Kheroni market area.Both sides were agitated, and security forces initially tried to pacify them. However, the situation escalated when the two groups began pelting stones at each other, injuring several protesters, police personnel and media persons covering the incident.As the situation spiralled out of control, police resorted to lathi-charge and later fired tear gas shells to disperse the two groups.The situation remains ""tense"" in the area, and additional forces have been rushed to the spot.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma described the situation in Karbi Anglong as “very sensitive.”“Senior minister Ranoj Pegu is present in the district. I believe the matter will be resolved soon,” he told reporters on the sidelines of a programme.The violence occurred despite prohibitory orders being in force in the area.Earlier on Tuesday, protesters called off their hunger strike demanding the eviction of encroachers from tribal belt areas following talks with Pegu, the state education minister.The agitators, representing several political and social organisations, had been on a hunger strike for the past 15 days, pressing for the eviction of illegal settlers.After Pegu held discussions with the protesters, they withdrew the hunger strike following assurances from the government that tripartite talks on the issue would be held soon.Pegu also assured them that CM Sarma would also be present at the meeting.On Monday, four people were injured in police firing after protesters went on a rampage, setting ablaze the residence of Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council (KAAC) chief executive Member Tuliram Ronghang and around 15 shops in Kheroni Bazaar.The mob also attempted to attack the local police station but was thwarted by security forces.Following the violence, Sarma indicated that rumours had circulated claiming three hunger-striking protesters had been arrested, which led others to become “agitated.”“No one has been arrested. They were taken to Guwahati for treatment as their health deteriorated,” he clarified.The protesters are demanding the eviction of “encroachers,” most of whom they claim hail from Bihar, from Professional Grazing Reserve (PGR) and Village Grazing Reserve (VGR) lands in Karbi Anglong and West Karbi Anglong.","At least eight people injured as clash between two groups of protestors prompts police to resort to lathi-charge and tear-gas shelling.

NEW DELHI: Delhi lieutenant governor VK Saxena on Tuesday wrote to former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, holding his government responsible for the capital's deteriorating air quality.In a 15-page letter, LG Saxena said, “11 years of neglect and criminal inaction on you and your Government’s part are responsible for the emergency air situation in the Capital”.However, Delhi is currently governed by BJP chief minister Rekha Gupta.Delhi LG’s letter to the former chief minister comes against the backdrop of the capital’s persistent and severe air pollution crisis.On Delhi LG VK Saxena's letter to Kejriwal, AAP national media incharge Anurag Dhandha said, ""Has the LG, who left Delhi amidst all the pollution to go to Gujarat for his own pleasure, returned?

Aravalli Hills Row: Why Definition Battle Could Decide Mining Water Security And AQI In North India

NEW DELHI: Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Monday again addressed a press conference amid outrage over the ""new definition"" of the Aravali range, saying that ""no new mining leases will be permitted, especially in core, protected and ecologically sensitive areas, including the NCR"".Speaking on the Supreme Court's acceptance of the ""new definition"" of Aravalli, the minister said: ""The ruling recognises and endorses the Government of India’s sustained efforts to protect the Aravalli range through scientific assessment, strict safeguards and initiatives such as the Aravalli Green Wall Project.""He futher highlighted the expansion of Ramsar sites, afforestation drives and international recognition of India’s forest cover, saying that under the BJP-led NDA government remains ""firmly committed to balancing ecology and economy, while countering misinformation with facts and science"".Addressing concerns in some quarters over a possible expansion of mining activities in the Aravalli Hills and Ranges following the adoption of a uniform definition, Bhupender Yadav on Sunday said it was incorrect to conclude that mining would be permitted on all landforms below 100 metres in the Aravallis.“Only 0.19% of the total 1.44 lakh sq km area of Aravalli can be eligible for mining. The rest of the Aravalli is protected and secure,” he posted on X.Yadav explained that the Aravali range comprises all landforms located within 500 metres of two adjoining hills with a height of 100 metres or more. All landforms falling within this 500-metre zone, regardless of their height or slope, are excluded from the grant of mining leases, he said.The minister also elaborated on the issue while responding to a media query on the sidelines of a meeting of the National Tiger Conservation Authority at the Sundarbans, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The query related to the Supreme Court of India’s recent acceptance of a uniform, policy-level definition of the Aravali Hills and Ranges, particularly with respect to regulating mining.Following the apex court’s acceptance that any landform located in the Aravali districts with an elevation of 100 metres or more from the local relief would be classified as Aravali Hills, some stakeholders expressed apprehension that the move could open more than 90% of the Aravalis to mining, as most landforms lie below the 100-metre mark.","Bhupender yadav says ""no new mining leases will be permitted, especially in core, protected and ecologically sensitive areas, including the ncr"" supreme court's acceptance of the ""new definition"" of aravalli endorses the government's efforts to protect the range.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126121988,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-57824,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

The ethics board of the National Medical Commission (NMC), that is supposed to take up the complaint against the doctors, is empty barring one part-time member.After the findings of the special audit committee constituted by the department of pharmaceuticals, on the basis of an anonymous complaint, an apex committee conducted hearings to give the company a chance to defend itself. After hearing the company, this committee also concluded that there was “no justifiable reason for 30 healthcare professionals to journey abroad to Monaco and Paris” to gain knowledge about simple procedures in medical aesthetics, such as administration of “Botox and Juvederm”. “Such medical interventions are widely recognized as a lucrative commercial service and evidence attached to the complaint links healthcare professionals directly to the sale, purchase, or administration of such aesthetic products of M/s AbbVie,” stated the apex committee.In its order dated December 23, 2024, the committee let off Abbvie with just a reprimand for unethical marketing practices while asking the NMC to take action against 30 offending healthcare professionals as per the ethics code for doctors.However, the department of pharmaceuticals had not sent the names of the accused doctors to the NMC till June this year and their names are yet to be made public.In response to an RTI query the NMC revealed on December 17 that the five-member ethics and medical registration board (EMRB), which would have to hear the complaint against the doctors and decide what action is to be taken, is empty barring a part-time member. According to the health ministry’s response in Parliament on March 18 this year, the posts of the EMRB president had been vacant since June 2022 (now three-and-a-half years), and that of two whole time members since September 2022 and September 2024. In its reply, the NMC stated that “the statutory posts in NMC are filled by the central government/ministry of health and family welfare”.","Abbvie violated the uniform code for pharmaceutical marketing practices by spending almost rs 2 crore to sponsor luxury vacations abroad for 30 doctors.

Hindu Lynching Sparks Outrage: Shashi Tharoor Warns On Mob Rule, Priyanka Blasts Modi Govt Silence

Congress leader Shashi Tharoor hailed external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his ministry on Tuesday for establishing the Nalanda University campus in Bihar. He admired the university while attending a literature festival at the university, highlighting it as one of the MEA's significant but underappreciated achievements.""...I was hugely impressed by the Nalanda University campus while attending the @nalandalitlive. My warm congratulations to @DrSJaishankar and @IndianDiplomacy for this wonderful achievement, which deserves a higher rating among the many unsung contributions of MEA to our nation,"" Tharoor said on X.During his Bihar visit, Tharoor clarified his purpose was cultural, not political. He urged others to visit local attractions like the Bihar Museum and Bapu Tower.Notably, Tharoor has previously made statements supporting the Modi government, often differing from his party's stance. He recently pointed out India's absence from the world's top universities, saying ""India no longer hosts any of the world's leading universities.... While a few universities have now entered the top 200, none figure among the top 10 or even the top 50 worldwide.""The original Nalanda Mahavihara, dating from the third century BCE to the 13th century CE, was awarded UNESCO World Heritage status in 2016. Tharoor celebrated its rebirth after about 800 years since its destruction by Bakhtyar Khilji around 1200 AD.He emphasized that ancient Nalanda wasn't just successful due to lack of competition but because it was truly ""an extraordinary institution.""","Congress leader shashi tharoor hailed external affairs minister s jaishankar and his ministry for establishing the nalanda university campus in bihar.

PATIALA: An FIR was filed on Tuesday in connection with a Rs 8 crore online fraud that allegedly drove retired Punjab IG Amar Singh Chahal to attempt suicide a day earlier.Chahal allegedly shot himself on Monday with a licensed revolver of his IRB gunman at his residence in Patiala, sustaining a chest wound. After undergoing surgery at a private hospital, he is now stable and out of danger, police said.SSP Varun Sharma said the case was registered against unidentified persons under relevant sections of BNS relating to impersonation, cheating and forgery, along with provisions of IT Act, after recording the statements of Chahal's wife, son and daughter-in-law.The FIR was based on a complaint lodged by Chahal's wife. The former IG, according to cops, had not lodged any complaint with police regarding the fraud.Police had on Monday found a 12-page handwritten note addressed to Punjab DGP Gaurav Yadav at Chahal's house. The note detailed his distress over a Rs 8.1 crore loss to scammers posing as wealth managers via WhatsApp and Telegram groups named 'F-777 DBS Wealth Equity Research Group'.Police said around 25 bank accounts mentioned in the note had been frozen, wh-ile the money trail was being probed. Cops are examining the digital evidence.Sources said a few days ago, Chahal had met a recently retired Patiala DIG and appeared depressed.In his note, Chahal described the perpetrators as ""sophisticated scammers"" who lured him with promises of high stock trading returns and fake profit dashboards. The scammers allegedly built trust using initial fake gains, before pressuring larger investments through multiple bank accounts and demanding additional taxes and fees that blocked his ability to withdraw funds.Chahal borrowed funds of around Rs 7 crore from friends and family, investing around Rs 1 crore through three banks from Oct. In the note, he demanded an investigation by an SIT or CBI, and apologised to his family.","Chahal allegedly shot himself on monday with a licensed revolver of his irb gunman.

BHUBANESWAR/MALKANGIRI: A richer package rolled out by Odisha drew 22 Maoist insurgents from neighbouring Chhattisgarh to lay down arms Tuesday, marking the first mass surrender in state this year and coming just three months before Centre's deadline to end left-wing extremism nationwide.Police credited a revised policy that lifts rewards to nearly 20% above Chhattisgarh's rates, making Odisha the most lucrative destination for Maoist surrenders.Those who surrendered Tuesday carried a combined bounty of more than Rs 2 crore. Among those who surrendered were 10 women. They handed over nine firearms - an AK-47, two INSAS rifles, one self-loading rifle, three .303 rifles and two single-shot weapons - along with 150 rounds of ammunition and 20kg of explosives.""The Maoists formally renounced violence, severed ties with extremist activities, and pledged faith in democracy. It is a major setback to CPI (Maoist), weakening leadership, morale and operational strength,"" Khurania said.Between 2006 and Dec 2025, at least 610 Maoists - largely state, divisional and area committee members - surrendered in Odisha.","Police credited revised policy that lifts rewards to nearly 20% above chhattisgarh's rates.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday hit out at Rahul Gandhi and claimed he was losing support within Congress , allies and even his family as it seized on the comments of CPM MP John Brittas and Congress MP Imran Masood. With Robert Vadra chiming in to say there was countrywide support for the “Priyanka-as-PM” view, BJP moved in, calling the remarks a “show of no-confidence” in Rahul’s leadership that rattled him into going abroad and venting his anger.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla told a presser Rahul had been making “anti-India” remarks from Germany in his frustration. He noted Brittas’s statement that seasoned DMK MP T R Baalu had raised the issue of Rahul’s visit abroad when Parliament was debating key issues.BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandhari said, “Open fight between Rahul and Priyanka camps in Congress. Divide in Congress out in the open. Congress vs Congress.”Poonawalla suggested that the leadership issue has been simmering within Congress, referring to the recent expulsion of former Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim for his veiled criticism of Rahul and push for a central leadership for Priyanka. He also cited Congress MP Shashi Tharoor’s praise of development works in Bihar to slam RahulAs Rahul is becoming “politically dead”, the LoP has become “leader of propaganda” and has been making claims like Indian economy and democracy are dead, the BJP functionary said, challenging him to provide proof of his recent charge that a woman in Haryana voted 200 times.",Bjp seized on comments of cpm mp john brittas and congress mp imran masood.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Imran Masood said Rahul Gandhi is the acknowledged leader of the party, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's, issuing a clarification after a remark of his - ""if Priyanka was the PM, Hindus would not have faced persecution in Bangladesh like today"" - triggered a row.Masood explained that he was asked a question about Priyanka in context of Bangladesh, and he centered his response around it. ""Rahul Gandhi is leader of Congress, and he is also the leader of Priyanka... Rahul and Priyanka are grandchildren of Indira Gandhi. If they had the command, Hindus in Bangladesh would not have faced the situation that they are facing now (while BJP is in office). That's all I said.""The clarification, apparently after a prod from All India Congress Committee, sought to address the confusion that Masood's response caused, being grabbed by BJP and TV headlines - which called it opposition party's lack of confidence in Rahul. As if complementing Masood's remark, PTI quoted Priyanka's husband Robert Vadra as saying that ""Priyanka has a bright future in politics, and a time will come when people would like to see her at the top office. ""Masood also slammed senior party functionary Shashi Tharoor over the latter's praise for ""Bihar's model of development"", calling the LS member from Kerala directionless: ""He is at a stage in life where he is lost. He is with Congress and talks about BJP. BJP has no future in Kerala, what will he do?""Earlier, Masood had said, ""Is Priyanka Gandhi the Prime Minister? Make her the PM and see how she will retaliate like Indira Gandhi.She is the granddaughter of Indira, who inflicted so much damage on Pakistan that those wounds still haven't healed.""Seizing upon the issue, BJP spokesman Shehzad Poonawalla said, ""Congress MP Imran Masood has clearly said he does not have faith in Rahul anymore and sought to bring Priyanka in his place. Then an endorsement to this came from Robert Vadra, who said, 'Yes, it is correct'.""Congress is wary of ""Rahul vs Priyanka"" headlines, realising that overzealous supporters of the Gandhi siblings end up offering an opportunity to rival BJP.","Congress mp imran masood said rahul gandhi is the acknowledged leader of the party.

NEW DELHI: Union agriculture and rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Tuesday said that the newly-enacted Viksit Bharat-Guarantee for Rozgar and Aajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act (VB-G RAM G) will address labour shortage faced during peak farm seasons, thereby striking a balance between welfare of farmers and labourers.In a virtual address on the occasion of Farmers Day, Chouhan said information about this new development must be disseminated among farmers across country through Krishi Vigyan Kendras.VB-G RAM G Act has replaced MGNREGA. Under the new law, labourers will get work for 125 days a year instead of 100 days under MGNREGA, except for two months in a year when they are expected to be available for agricultural work.""G RAM G is extremely useful in broader interest of the country as it empowers the farming community and makes it self-reliant. While G RAM G fully takes care of uplifting labourers, it also focuses on farmers, ensuring sufficient labourers are available for farming,"" said Chouhan.He said that govt's objective is to increase income of farmers as well as labourers, and that will be achieved through this new law.","Vb-g ram g act has replaced mgnrega.

NEW DELHI: Even as Hindus are facing targeted attacks from Jamaat-e-Islami in Bangladesh, they are at the receiving end of ""targeted action"" of the Trinamool Congress govt in West Bengal, BJP alleged on Tuesday, slamming the state police for its use of force on protesters marching against violence aimed at minorities in the neighbouring country (Bangladesh).BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi claimed that TMC govt's action has shown that Hindus in the state are not allowed to express their pain, accusing West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee of drawing from the agenda of ""eradication of sanatan dharma"", a reference to a controversial speech made by DMK's Udhayanidhi Stalin.In this context, he cited the inflammatory comment of TMC functionary Madan Mitra that ""Lord Ram was a Muslim"", and the campaign by its MLA Humayun Kabir, who has since been sacked from the party, for building a Babri mosque and flayed the state's governing party for its policy vis-a-vis Hindus.He said that the protest by Hindu bodies was ""peaceful"", but the participants were targeted by state police. Police, on the other hand, said that they had resorted to baton-charge to disperse protesters after they breached barricades in an attempt to get closer to the Bangladesh deputy High Commission office in central Kolkata.Trivedi further added that the mindset of Bangladesh's Jamaat-e-Islami is being reflected in Trinamool Congress govt's approach.""Jamaat-e-Islami is orchestrating targeted attacks on Hindus and TMC is behind targeted action against Hindus,"" he alleged.","Bjp slams state police for its use of force on protesters marching against violence aimed at minorities in bangladesh.

NEW DELHI: CPM MP John Brittas on Tuesday questioned leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi's absence from Parliament in the final days of winter session when crucial bills, including VB-G RAM G, were passed despite opposition's protests. He also criticised Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's participation at the end of the session in the tea meeting hosted by Lok Sabha Speaker OM Birla in his chambers, which was also attended by PM Narendra Modi.""It was a desire that when a crucial legislation like VB-G RAM G is being bulldozed in Parliament along with other crucial bills on nuclear energy and insurance, we expected the leader of opposition (Rahul) to lead INDIA bloc or opposition rank and file. That was an expectation and a desire,"" he told NDTV.Speaking to channels and news agencies, Brittas also said that he was not alone and other politicians from INDIA bloc too felt the same way about Rahul's absence. He said they felt that Rahul's presence would have made a big difference. ""The calendar of winter session is known to all members. So, I feel the LoP would have looked at the session's calendar and in all fairness he should have been there.Rahul's presence would have made a big difference,"" he reiterated.However, Brittas said that it is up to Rahul and his party to decide whether he needs to be in Parliament or he needs to be elsewhere.On Priyanka's decision to attend the tea meeting, Brittas was clear that it sends out the ""wrong message"" and cited how in past sessions, when govt passed waqf bill and did not hold a discussion on special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, opposition skipped these meetings. ""Compared to all those boycotts, this was a humongous issue,"" he told ANI referring to VB-G RAM G's passage.""Just couple of hours after bulldozing the bill to eliminate MGNREGA, it was not a good scene for us to see Priyanka and others sitting at the tea party along with the PM,"" he added.",Cpm mp john brittas questioned leader of opposition in lok sabha rahul gandhi's absence from parliament.
