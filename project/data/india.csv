"Can Sharjeel, Umar speeches be deemed terror acts: Supreme Court to cops",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-sharjeel-umar-speeches-be-deemed-terror-acts-supreme-court-to-cops/articleshow/125900689.cms,"The Supreme Court questioned Delhi Police on invoking stringent UAPA provisions against riot accused for speeches, seeking justification for linking terror acts to their words. Justices sought clarity on how Section 15, pertaining to terrorist acts, applies when arms weren't directly used by the accused, who have been jailed for over five years.

Sharjeel seems to be a punching bag: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court questioned Delhi Police Wednesday over how Section 15 of UAPA, which pertains to terrorist acts, can be invoked against Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and other accused in a Delhi riots case for giving speeches and how terror acts can be linked with such speeches.A bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and N V Anjaria, which reserved its order on bail pleas of the six accused, sought a response from additional solicitor general S V Raju in light of senior advocate Siddharth Dave's contention that at most Section 13 (unlawful activities) and Section 18 (conspiracy) could be invoked for the speeches.The ASG submitted that the riots took place because of a conspiracy hatched by the accused and whatever they had said in their speeches became reality. Raju said Imam's speech on blocking Chicken's Neck was an attack on the integrity of the country and Khalid's speech on chakka jam was an attack on economic security and justified invoking Section 15.The court thereafter pointed out that Delhi Police had not attributed the wielding of arms or explosives to the six accused, which is a requirement under the provision. Raju, however, said that petrol bombs were used in Delhi riots.""It is a case of conspiracy. It is not my case that they used petrol bombs. My case is that they are part of the conspiracy to create the situation for the use of petrol bombs. For use of petrol bombs, there is a separate case against other people,"" he said.The bench then wrapped up the hearing, which had stretched over 11 days, and reserved its order. As the Delhi Police's arguments were particularly focused on Imam's speeches, which were also played in the courtroom to oppose the bail plea, and the other five accused - Umar Khalid, Gulfisha Fatima, Meeran Haider, Shadab Ahmed and Mohd Saleem Khan - had distanced themselves from him, the bench observed that Imam seemed to be a punching bag for both sides.The accused, who have been in custody for more than five years, approached the apex court after their bail plea had been rejected by Delhi High Court. Opposing their bail plea, Delhi Police accused them of indulging in regime change and told the court that they were behind ""well-crafted, orchestrated, preplanned, choreographed riots"" to divide the country on communal lines to achieve ""the final regime change goal"".The accused, however, told the court that holding protests and opposing the govt was not an offence, and they are being prosecuted to send a message to others that anyone who raises their voice would be similarly punished. Invoking Gandhi, they said that non-violent protest and civil disobedience was a part and parcel of democracy and cannot be criminalised, as happened in the colonial era. As Delhi Police played their allegedly inflammatory speeches, the accused brought to the court's notice clippings of their speeches in which they had talked about the constitutional spirit and responding to hate with love, to violence with non-violence and enmity with brotherhood.","Justices sought clarity on how section 15, pertaining to terrorist acts, applies when arms weren't directly used by the accused. Justices aravind kumar and n v anjaria reserved its order on bail pleas of the six accused. Delhi police accused them of indulging in regime change and told the court that they were behind riots.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125900689,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-625663,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

IndiGo scrapped 25% of over 17k domestic flights from Dec 1-9

NEW DELHI: In a first-of-its-kind move, DGCA on Wednesday set up an eight-member ""oversight team"" of senior flight operations inspectors to oversee IndiGo's operational aspects, including monitoring flights, crew availability and pilot shortage situation on a daily basis.Two officials (not pilots) will oversee the cancellation and refund status; payment of compensation to passengers for deficiency in services as per norms and status of baggage return. Two senior FOIs (who are pilots) will remain at the airline's Gurgaon office on a daily basis to keep a close vigil. Both teams will submit a daily report to DGCA. The order came as it emerged IndiGo had cancelled a fourth of 17,404 domestic flights it was to operate from Dec 1-9 (both days included), as per govt data released Wednesday.IndiGo had cancelled a fourth of 17,404 domestic flights between Dec 1 and 9, which explains the unprecedented chaos witnessed at Indian airports.

Now the airline has to submit its entire operational details to govt and then its schedule will accordingly be approved to avoid a rerun of the disruption being seen this month.Elbers and his team on Thursday will have to tell the regulator on Thursday the status of flight restoration, how affected passengers are being accommodated and the monitoring mechanism to ensure timely completion of restoration. They will be asked about the status of refunds, baggage return, how is its improving timely communication about delays and cancellations and the policy on re-routing passengers on alternate flights.","Indigo had cancelled a fourth of 17,404 domestic flights between dec 1 and 9.

'Detect, Delete, Deport': Amit Shah Blasts Rahul Gandhi Over Infiltrators, Oppn Stages Walkout

CIC has been without a chief since September 13

The three-member selection committee headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi that met on Wednesday to appoint the new Chief Information Commissioner (CIC), eight information commissioners (ICs) and a vigilance commissioner is learnt to have finalised the names. However, Leader of Opposition (LoP) in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi is learnt to have registered his strong dissent to the choices and submitted the same in writing, sources said.Gandhi is said to have strongly objected to the absence of names from Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and OBC communities. The issue raised by the Congress neta is likely to be a key talking point in the upcoming mega rally against ""vote chori"" being organised by Congress on Dec 14.The details of the appointments were not known till late in the evening.The meeting that lasted for nearly one and a half hours was held at the Prime Minister's Office. It was also attended by home minister Amit Shah. Sources said the LoP sought more details of the appointees and also questioned the criteria adopted for the selection of CIC and ICs.According to sources, Gandhi was of the view that the govt's proposal on the names was completely ""biased"".He apparently said that the absence of weaker communities from constitutional positions was unacceptable, given the need to strengthen their participation across the board, including higher positions. The LoP is learnt to have forcefully put forth his differences on the govt proposal.There were three parts to the meeting: One on appointment of CIC, another on choice of eight ICs & third on vigilance commissioner.While Gandhi registered his ""dissent"" in writing separately on the govt's proposal for CIC and vigilance commissioner, he gave his ""observations"" on the eight names for the post of ICs, sources said. The Central Information Commission has been without a chief since incumbent Heeralal Samariya demitted office on Sept 13 on attaining the age of 65 years.Besides the chief, the commission can have up to 10 commissioners. Currently, it is making do with just two - Anandi Ramalingam and Vinod Tiwari. According to commission's website, the pending caseload stands at over 30,800.The eight posts of information commissioners have been vacant since Nov 2023. With Samariya demitting office, the chief's post fell vacant for the seventh time since 2014.There was a total of 53 names in the panels prepared by the govt and presented before the collegium for the 10 positions. On the objection raised, the govt is said to have agreed to include a few from the marginalised communities in the panels. But there was still no clarity about their inclusion in the appointments.Under Section 12 (3) of the RTI Act, the prime minister is the chairperson of the search committee, which also comprises the LoP and a Union minister nominated by the PM.According to the procedure for the appointment of CIC, the particulars of interested candidates are invited through advertisements in newspapers and through the DoPT website.","The central information commission has been without a chief since september 13.

NEW DELHI: Taking strong exception to Haryana govt cutting 40 fully grown trees in a green belt to build a road to make the office of BJP in Karnal accessible, Supreme Court on Wednesday directed it to restore the green belt within three months after the govt and Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) failed to convince it of the legality of the action.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan noted in its order that the explanation given by the state and HSVP was merely an ""eyewash to mislead the court"".The state authority claimed that the trees were felled to widen the road. Additional solicitor general Vikramjit Banerjee, appearing for HSVP, told the bench that Resident Welfare Association of Section 9 was also consulted and its consent taken prior to the felling of trees. He further pointed out that compulsory plantation had been done by the authority.But the bench was not convinced and asked how the green belt could be damaged for widening roads. Though the petitioner had also challenged the allotment of land to BJP to build an office there, the bench said it cannot examine the allotment which was done way back in 2018.The court, however, directed the authority to restore the green belt and made clear that the widening of road to BJP office had to be undone.It granted the authority three months to do the needful and file a report with photographs of the site.The court passed the order on a petition filed by a 1971-War veteran, challenging the dismissal of his plea by the high court on May 3 against the allotment of a plot in a residential area of Karnal to BJP and the subsequent construction of an access road for its office by uprooting 40 fully grown trees situated in a green area.Rajput (79) said he was wounded in the war and a decorated soldier, having been awarded the Vir Chakra for gallantry. He had purchased a plot measuring 1,000 square yards in Sector 9, Urban Estate, Karnal, from Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), then the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA).","Slams cutting of 40 trees for access road to bjp office in haryana.

Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

NEW DELHI: Goa Police have detained Ajay Gupta, a co-owner of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, after a devastating fire at the Arpora establishment killed 25 people. Gupta, who was held in Delhi on Tuesday, insisted he had no role in the day-to-day running of the club. “I am just a partner. I don’t know anything,” he said soon after being picked up, following a Lookout Circular issued against him.The arrest comes as investigators widen their search for the club’s primary owners, brothers Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, who fled to Phuket hours after the blaze. Interpol has issued a Blue Corner Notice to help trace them, and officers say this was processed unusually quickly. Goa Police are coordinating with the CBI and Interpol, and Chief Minister Pramod Sawant has said a team will be sent to Thailand to bring the accused back.Also read: Goa authorities trashed own report on violations by club The Bureau of Immigration earlier informed police that the Luthras boarded IndiGo flight 6E 1073 from Delhi to Phuket on Sunday morning.

A Blue Corner Notice has also been issued against the property owner, British national Surinder Kumar Khosla.Gupta is expected to be flown to Goa on Wednesday and placed under arrest once formalities are complete.Five others connected with the nightclub — chief general manager Rajiv Modak, general manager Vivek Singh, bar manager Rajiv Singhania, gate manager Riyanshu Thakur and employee Bharat Kohli — have already been arrested.Goa Tourism Minister Rohan Khaunte called the fire “a very tragic episode”, saying accountability must be fixed and that an inquiry should deliver a factual report. On Tuesday, the district administration also demolished part of the Romeo Lane restaurant in Vagator, owned by the Luthras, citing illegal construction.","Ajay gupta, a co-owner of the birch by romeo lane nightclub, has been detained.

BENGALURU: A 22-year-old nursing student's claim of being gang-raped by a cab driver and his accomplices near Sir M Visvesvaraya Terminal has been revealed as false. Police found CCTV footage and WhatsApp chats indicating a consensual encounter. The woman, who filed the complaint on Dec 6, allegedly fabricated the story to avoid her boyfriend's questions about the scratch marks on her neck.The investigation is ongoing, and the driver, who has pleaded his innocence, remains in police custody.On the night of Dec 6, the nursing student from a private college and originally from Kerala, reported to Madiwala police station that she had been gang-raped by a cab driver and several of his friends inside the vehicle near Sir M Visvesvaraya Terminal on the night of Dec 2.In response, police quickly registered a gang-rape case and transferred it to Banaswadi police station due to jurisdictional issues. Before this transfer, senior police officers were informed of the incident, and based on the student's statement, the driver was arrested at his residence in east Bengaluru.The cab driver, a 33-year-old father of two with a homemaker wife, was in shock upon hearing the allegations against him.Throughout the process, he maintained his innocence.Meanwhile, police reviewed CCTV footage from the incident location and were surprised to see the nursing student and the cab driver together at the railway station between 11.30pm on Dec 2 and 5.30am on Dec 3.

Amit Shah gives point-by-point rebuttal on 'vote chori' charge

NEW DELHI: The debate on the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in the Lok Sabha turned heated on Wednesday as leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi challenged home minister Amit Shah to an open debate, prompting a firm response from the minister: ""I will decide.""As Shah countered the opposition’s allegations of 'vote chori' and referred to Rahul Gandhi’s charge of ""multiple voters at one Haryana house,"" the Congress leader stood up, interrupting the speech.""My question yesterday was that for the first time in history, full immunity was given to the election commissioner. I wanted to know the reasoning behind this decision. Secondly, about Haryana, he [Amit Shah] took one example of fake voters, but there are 19 lakh fake voters,” Rahul said.""You tell us ... actually, let us have a debate on my press conference, very good idea, let us go, let us have a debate,"" he added.""Amit Shah ji, I challenge you, I challenge you to have a debate,"" Rahul declared in the House.Amid uproar, Shah responded, ""Speaker sir, I want to clarify first, I have been elected as an MLA or MP for the last 30 years. I have a long experience of the procedures.""Looking directly at Rahul Gandhi, he said in a stern manner, ""Parliament will not proceed according to your wishes.I will decide the sequence of my speech. The Parliament will not work like this.""""Speaker sir, he should have some patience to listen to my answer. I will reply to each and everything. But he will not decide the sequence of my speech, I will decide it,"" Shah reiterated.""This is a completely defensive response, a scared response,"" Rahul retorted.Resuming his address with a noticeably calm tone, Shah told Speaker Om Birla, ""I can see worry lines on your face. Do not worry, I will not be provoked by them. I will continue with my reply.""Shah then went on to address the 'vote chori' accusations, stating that such issues occurred during the tenures of Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. He also referenced a case in the Delhi high court, alleging that Sonia Gandhi became a voter before becoming Indian.Amit Shah offered a point-by-point rebuttal over the allegation of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over vote theft in the Lok Sabha.During the ongoing debate on electoral reforms in the Parliament, Shah took a jibe at the Congress leader's ""nuclear bomb"" press conference said that his press conferences are not ""Constitutional provisions.""""Opposition Leader Rahul Gandhi dropped a “nuclear bomb” in a press conference on 5 November 2025. In that ‘nuclear bomb’, he claimed that 501 votes had been cast from a single house in Haryana. The Election Commission has clarified that House Number 265 is no small dwelling, but rather a joint residence for multiple families built on a one-acre ancestral plot,"" the home minister said.""However, separate house numbers have not been assigned to each family, so their house number is simply listed as 265. And in one of those families, three generations are living together. This numbering has been in place since the Congress government was elected in Haryana. It is neither a fake house nor fake votes,"" he added.Shah also said that it is unfair to blame the people who appear twice in the voter list.""Congress has claimed that some individuals are registered in two different locations on the electoral roll. It is unfair to blame the people who appear twice, as this is often a result of systemic issues. Since 2010, the Returning Officer's authority to remove duplicate entries has been revoked, which has led to such discrepancies. In fact, there are several leaders whose names are registered in more than one place. These are common mistakes caused by the updated rules,"" Shah said.","Rahul gandhi's 'open challenge' to amit shah in lok sabha over sir gets 'i will decide' reply.

Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

NEW DELHI:Goa police said the brothers purchased seats on a Phuket-bound flight at 1.17 am on December 7, even as firefighters and local authorities were struggling to contain the flames and rescue staff at Birch by Romeo Lane in Arpora, North Goa.By 5.30 am, they were airborne on IndiGo flight 6E-1073. Goa DGP Alok Kumar described their rapid exit as “a clear attempt to evade investigation.”In the days since, the brothers have approached a Delhi court seeking four weeks of transit anticipatory bail, claiming they left for Thailand for work purposes, not to slip away from the law.

NEW DLEHI: Home minister Amit Shah ’s remarks during the Lok Sabha debate on election reforms sparked strong protests from Congress MPs on Wednesday, after he listed three instances across different eras in which he alleged the party engaged in “vote chori”, naming former prime ministers Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, and referring to a case involving Sonia Gandhi over voter registration.Shah countered the Opposition’s accusation of “vote theft” by citing what he described as “three phases” of electoral malpractice linked to the Congress, including a pending case in a Delhi court that, according to him, disputes whether Sonia Gandhi was registered as a voter before acquiring Indian citizenship.“ ... when you’re not eligible, still you become a voter. A while back, a case was brought up in a Delhi court where the dispute is that Sonia Gandhi became a voter even before she became a citizen of the country,” the home minister said.“There are three instances of vote-chori, first when Jawaharlal Nehru became PM even after losing the vote to Sardar Patel to choose the country's first PM ... second when Indira Gandhi’s election from Rebareli was set aside in 1975 by Allahabad HC and to cover it up she brought in bill in Parliament to provide immunity to PM’s – that no case can be brought against the PMs ... third, when you’re not eligible still you become a voter.A while back, a case was brought up in a Delhi court where the dispute is that Sonia Gandhi became a voter even before she became a citizen of the country,” he said.The opposition benches erupted, prompting Shah to respond, “I have just said what is a fact that there’s a case in court, Sonia ji needs to respond in court why they’re replying here?”Congress MP KC Venugopal raised a point of order, insisting the allegation was baseless.“The case from the 80s that was filed against Ms Sonia Gandhi, the Rouse Avenue court dismissed that case; there is no substance in that case. Ms Gandhi didn’t even vote in that election and I’m challenging HM, Ms Sonia Gandhi didn’t even vote in that election. Can you prove it otherwise? HM is making misleading statements,” he said.Shah clarified that he had drawn no conclusions and merely spoke a fact.“I haven't said anything like that, I haven't made any conclusion. The conclusion would come out once she responds to the court order, and then I’ll discuss it again. I only said, a case has been registered in which a notice has been issued to Ms Gandhi.

NEW DLEHI: The external affairs ministry on Wednesday received a request from the Goa government seeking to revoke the passports of Gaurav and Saurabh Luthra, and the request is currently under examination, reported PTI citing sources.The move comes amid an expanding probe into the nightclub blaze in North Goa that killed 25 people last week. Earlier on Tuesday Interpol issued a blue corner notice against the brothers, who are believed to be hiding in Phuket, Thailand.According to the police investigation, the Luthra brothers booked tickets for a Phuket-bound flight at 1.17am on December 7, even as firefighters battled the massive fire at Birch by Romeo Lane in Arpora.

‘Days and nights have become the same for me’

I am extremely busy. I mean, what should I even tell you — there is a lot of pressure. Rita Mandal

Who said what

NEW DELHI: The Booth Level Officers (BLOs), who have been a silent and almost invisible part of India’s electoral machinery for decades, have suddenly found themselves at the centre of attention. The Election Commission ’s ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls has placed them at the centre of one of the largest verification drives in recent years, making their day-to-day labour impossible to ignore.What was once routine verification has now become a high-intensity, deadline-bound exercise. With the first phase scheduled to end on December 11, BLOs across West Bengal say they are clocking 12–16 hour days, making multiple visits to the same households, filling forms for those unable to do so, and uploading details late into the night on their phones. For many, the pressure has blurred the line between work and exhaustion, day and night.It is in this backdrop that The Times of India spoke to several BLOs in West Bengal to understand what the job looks like on the ground — the rush, the numbers, the fatigue, and the uneven experiences.“Pressure bahut zyada hai. Sabke andar ek tarah ka dar samaya hua hai (The pressure is extremely high. Everyone seems to be filled with fear),” said Chotelal Paswan, a Booth Level Officer, in conversation with TOI.Posted as a teacher in a middle school in West Bengal’s Bardhaman district, Chotelal is the sole breadwinner for a family of five. After being notified for BLO duty, he now leaves home every day at 8am and spends the entire day distributing and collecting forms. Once the field work ends, he uploads voters’ details, a process that often keeps him occupied till midnight.“The Election Commission informed us just four days before that we would be assigned this duty. Our training began two days before the work started. We receive instructions from the BDO office to begin data collection early in the morning. We carry forms and go door to door. If someone has already filled theirs, we collect it. After that, we have to submit a report to our supervisor mentioning how many forms were collected, how many were pending and how many death-related cases were found,” he said.“In a day, we are able to collect details of about 80–100 voters, that too if everyone is at home,” he added.Chotelal says delays on the ground often slow down the process. He frequently has to revisit houses, sometimes multiple times, and many voters aren’t aware of the urgency of the exercise.“We have to visit each house at least 5–6 times. Even then, many people who have filled their forms refuse to hand them over. They say, ‘Come after ten days,’ or ‘We are busy right now,’” he said.“This causes us a lot of trouble. Many people don’t understand the importance of this exercise. They say, ‘What difference will it make? We’ll give it later.’ But our official responsibility is to submit everything on time. For those who are not literate, we even have to fill out the forms ourselves,” he added.When asked whether there is pressure from political parties or senior officials, he paused before responding: “What can I say… this is an internal matter. But we are under so much pressure that we cannot speak freely. There is pressure from the BDO, pressure from the panchayat pradhan, pressure from the supervisor. On top of that, local party leaders and BLAs exert separate pressure. If we don’t follow their instructions, we fear consequences. ”He estimates that 30–40% of his work is still pending with the deadline looming. He is also required to attend school duties occasionally as examinations approach — despite the BLO Handbook 2011 stating that officers should be relieved of regular office responsibilities during revision periods.“So far, about 70% of the work is completed. We must submit the report by December 11. But if urgent work comes up in the school, I have to go there too,” he said.He also highlights the limitations of technology on the ground.“We work alone — one person has to collect data, upload it, categorise it and attach photographs. In terms of technology, all we have is a mobile phone. How much can we do?” he asked.“Most nights, it is 11pm or even midnight by the time we end our day's work and we are back in the field the next morning. Because of this, the error margin rises, almost up to 30%,” he added.On reports of BLOs allegedly dying by suicide due to work stress, he says the strain is visible around him.“In Bardhaman district, two women BLOs have committed suicide — we heard this from the news. The pressure is extremely high. Even yesterday, 2–4 women BLOs sitting with us were in very bad shape. Everyone seems to be filled with fear,” Chotelal said.“Everyone is scared. The workload is so heavy that sometimes responding properly becomes difficult. Yet the supervisor and BDO keep demanding answers. They tell us, ‘You must finish the work somehow,’” he added.Rita Mandal, a BLO posted in Kolkata’s Dumdum, says her routine has been consumed by SIR work since she was assigned duty. She admits that she has been working late nights under significant stress.“I am extremely busy. I mean, what should I even tell you — there is a lot of pressure,” she told The Times of India.“I have also been extremely busy at night. Because of this work, days and nights have become the same for me,” she said.In contrast, a BLO from Palpara Chandakh described a smoother experience, saying the workload was manageable in her area and that she received adequate support.“Look, this is not my personal work — this is government work. Everyone has a different experience, and my experience has been more or less good,” she said, requesting anonymity.She added that her supervisor and BDO had arranged an assistant BLO given the high voter density in her assigned area.“Our job was simply to distribute the forms, then collect them, and now I have submitted all the forms. There were a lot of voters, so the BDO office provided me with an assistant BLO. My supervisor and other seniors helped me a lot. We got so immersed in the work that we lost track of date and time. Training happened in phases, and whenever we faced difficulty, we called the BDO office and received immediate updates,” she said.She also denied reports of political pressure from local BLAs or party workers, adding that the BLAs in her area were helpful.“BLAs in my assigned area were very helpful. There were too many voters, and I could not know everyone personally, so they assisted in collecting forms and verifying addresses. The BLAs supported me throughout,” she said.Both the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have acknowledged that BLOs are working under heavy strain. The BJP has alleged that BLOs are functioning under the threat and pressure of “TMC goons”, while the ruling TMC party in Bengal has blamed the Election Commission, calling the SIR timeline “inhuman” and “unplanned”.""Why are BLOs dying only in Mamata's Bengal? Because in Bengal, TMC goons threaten teachers, Anganwadi and ASHA workers: 'Finish the voter list fast or lose your job, face transfers, face violence'. The pressure is not from the ECI – it is from TMC’s terror mafia,"" BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya said.Meanwhile, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has argued that an exercise earlier spread across three years is now being compressed into two months “to please political masters”, thereby placing “inhuman pressure” on ground-level staff.“A process that earlier took three years is now being forced into two months on the eve of elections to please political masters, putting inhuman pressure on BLOs,” Mamata said.Whether the SIR will deliver a smoother voter list may take time to show. But for now, the immediate reality for BLOs is clear: the work has been heavy, and the days have been long.","The election commission’s ongoing special intensive revision (sir) of electoral rolls has placed them at the centre of one of the largest verification drives in recent years.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday offered a point-by-point rebuttal over the allegation of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over vote theft in the Lok Sabha.During the ongoing debate on electoral reforms in the Parliament, Shah took a jibe at the Congress leader's ""nuclear bomb"" press conference said that his press conferences are not ""Constitutional provisions. """"Opposition Leader Rahul Gandhi dropped a “nuclear bomb” in a press conference on 5 November 2025. In that ‘nuclear bomb’, he claimed that 501 votes had been cast from a single house in Haryana. The Election Commission has clarified that House Number 265 is no small dwelling, but rather a joint residence for multiple families built on a one-acre ancestral plot,"" the home minister said.""However, separate house numbers have not been assigned to each family, so their house number is simply listed as 265. And in one of those families, three generations are living together. This numbering has been in place since the Congress government was elected in Haryana. It is neither a fake house nor fake votes,"" he added.Shah also said that it is unfair to blame the people who appear twice in the voter list.""Congress has claimed that some individuals are registered in two different locations on the electoral roll. It is unfair to blame the people who appear twice, as this is often a result of systemic issues.Since 2010, the Returning Officer's authority to remove duplicate entries has been revoked, which has led to such discrepancies. In fact, there are several leaders whose names are registered in more than one place. These are common mistakes caused by the updated rules,"" Shah said.""The SIR is meant to prevent such occurrences, yet we are being accused of 'Vote Chori',"" he added.Amit Shah also replied to the three questions Rahul Gandhi had asked a day earlier.""I want to ask three questions which will make it very clear that the BJP is directing and using the Election Commission to damage India's democracy,"" Rahul had said.""Why the Chief Justice of India was removed from the selection panel for Election Commissioners?; Why, in December 2023, the government granted unprecedented immunity to Election Commissioners?; Why CCTV footage of polling stations is destroyed after 45 days?"" he had asked.Replying to Rahul Gandhi during his address, Amit Shah said, ""For 73 years, there was no law governing the appointment of the Election Commission in this country; the process was overseen directly by the Prime Minister. From 1950 to 1989, the Election Commission operated as a single-member body. Throughout this period, the Prime Minister was responsible for all appointments to the Commission, and these appointments were never contested. ""“From 1950-1989, the Election Commission was a one-person panel. The PM used to send a file to the President, and the latter would notify the same – it was fine then. From 1989-91, a multi-member panel was introduced to govern the poll panel,"" he said, adding, “In 2023, we made a law that there would be a Prime Minister, a minister chosen by him and the Leader of Opposition who will elect the Election Commissioner. We brought transparency,"" he added.On CCTV footage being destroyed after 45 days, Shah said that keeping footage record of a polling booth is for internal management, not an admissible document. “This is just a simple thing…They don’t understand…Sense can’t be injected,"" said Shah, adding, “The CCTV footage of a polling station is deleted after 45 days as per law. Why do they question it? Why don’t they ask for it before 45 days of voting?""“Discussion on EVMs was stopped in 2004 and 2009 because they (Congress) won. In 2014, when they lost, they started complaining again. Chunav main chori bandh hui hai isiliye pet mein dard ho raha hai,"" he said.This comes days after Rahul Gandhi held two press conferences and claimed that Election Commission and Bharatiya Janata Party are hatching the conspiracy of stealing the mandate.Rahul addressed said that his team has ""100 per cent"" proof that around 25 lakh voters in Haryana are either duplicate, non-existent or manipulated.""We have the word 'H' Files and this is about how an entire state has been stolen. We suspected that this is not happening in individual constituencies, but at the state level and at the national level,"" Rahul said.""We got a lot of complaints in Haryana, from our candidates, that something was wrong and not working. Their predictions all went upside down. We had experienced this in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra but we decided to zoom into Haryana and go into details about what had happened there,"" he added.The Congress leader shared a breakup for the unaccounted votes and claimed that ""vote chori"" happened in Haryana assembly elections to the tune of 25 lakhs under 5 categories -- Duplicate voters, invalid addresses, bulk voters, and others.He had further claimed that a lady, who turned out to be a Brazilian model, voted 22 times at 10 different booths with different names in the Haryana assembly elections.","Rahul gandhi's 'open challenge' to amit shah in lok sabha over sir gets 'i will decide' reply.

NEW DELHI: A Maharastra MLA on Wednesday chose a unique way to present his stance in the state legislative assembly. Sharad Sonawane, the MLA from Junnar, arrived at the Maharashtra legislature dressed in a leopard-print outfit to protest the rising number of leopard-related incidents across the state.His demonstration came hours after a leopard in Nagpur’s Pardi area injured seven people before being captured by the forest department. On being asked by reporter about his dress-up, Sonawane said, ""An emergency should be declared for leopard attacks in the state. I have been raising this issue since 2014, but the government has kept ignoring me.""Further offering suggestions to deal with the issue, he added, ""Rescue centres should be made, and the leopards should be trapped and kept in the centres...""At Vidhan Bhavan, the Shiv Sena legislator said leopard attacks had claimed 55 lives in Junnar taluka of Pune district in the past three months. He said residents were living in constant fear and urged the state to set up rescue facilities capable of accommodating up to 2,000 leopards in both Junnar taluka and Ahilyanagar district.Additionally, responding to Forest Minister Ganesh Naik’s statement a day earlier that goats would be released in forests to divert leopards, Sonawane said the measure would not work, arguing that leopards increasingly occupy sugarcane fields and areas near human habitation.He demanded that the government declare a “state emergency” and initiate the capture of at least 2,000 leopards for placement in rescue centres.","Sharad sonawane, the mla from junnar, arrived at the maharashtra legislature dressed in a leopard-print outfit.

Cops to counter bail petition of Sharjeel today





NEW DELHI: Analysing the alleged inflammatory speeches of Sharjeel Imam, being prosecuted under UAPA in connection with the Northeast Delhi riots, Supreme Court said Tuesday his speech on blocking “Chicken’s Neck”, or Siliguri Corridor, was objectionable, but his lawyer pointed out other parts of the speech in which he appealed to protesters to adhere to the constitutional spirit and non-violence, and admitted that it could have been better-worded.Senior advocate Siddharth Dave, appearing for Sharjeel, also told the court that there was no credible evidence against him because of which he was rightly not made an accused in any one of the 750 cases related to the 2020 riots registered in the capital.Dave made the court hear other clippings of Sharjeel’s speeches in which he had appealed to people not to resort to violence while protesting.Dave contended that Sharjeel was being prosecuted in 10 different cases in different states arising out of his speeches and he had been granted bail in all the cases and cannot be prosecuted again under the anti-terror law. He told SC that he was already in custody when the riots broke out and there was no evidence against him as he was not associated with the rioters.“There is a legislation in Parliament. He was resisting the legislation. He is entitled to protest. Some of his speeches are unpalatable. It could have remained within the four corners of law. But today he is standing, asking for bail after six years in custody. He was not physically present or an accused in any of the cases when the riots actually took place,” he said.Dave also questioned why the govt did not bring NIA to probe the cases in view of Delhi Police’s allegation that it was an attempt for regime change. He concluded by quoting from a poem Faiz Ahmed Faiz penned during his incarceration in Pakistan: “Dil naummeed tou nahin nakaam hi to hai.

Ex-judges slam 'motivated' drive against CJI for Rohingya remark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ex-judges-slam-motivated-drive-against-cji-for-rohingya-remark/articleshow/125900237.cms,"NEW DELHI: Forty-four former judges, including those who were in the Supreme Court and high courts, have issued a joint statement strongly condemning ""a motivated campaign"" against CJI Surya Kant following his remarks in the Dec 2 court proceedings related to Rohingyas.The statement said that while judicial proceedings may legitimately invite reasoned criticism, there were attempts, including an open letter issued on Dec 5 by another group of former judges, to ""delegitimise the judiciary"" by mischaracterising routine courtroom queries as an act of prejudice.The signatories included former SC judges Anil Dave and Hemant Gupta, Anil Deo Singh (former chief justice Rajasthan HC), BC Patel (former chief justice J&K and Delhi HCs), PB Bajanthri (former chief justice Patna HC) and Subhro Kama Mukherjee (former chief justice Karnataka HC).""The CJI is being attacked for asking the most basic legal question: who, in law, has granted the status that is being claimed before the court? No adjudication on rights or entitlements can proceed unless this threshold is addressed,"" the statement said.It said the ongoing campaign ""conveniently omits"" the CJI Kant-led bench's categorical affirmation that no person on Indian soil - citizen or foreigner - can be subjected to torture, disappearance or inhuman treatment.""To suppress this, and then accuse the court of 'dehumanisation' is a serious distortion of what was actually said,"" it said.The signatories highlighted Rohingyas have not been admitted to India under any statutory refugee-protection framework, and that India is neither a party to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention nor its 1967 Protocol. The statement said concerns over the illegal procurement of Aadhaar, ration cards and other documents by foreign nationals merit urgent scrutiny.It said an SC-monitored SIT may be necessary to inquire into how illegally entered migrants obtained these documents, and to identify networks facilitating such activities. The complex citizenship status of the Rohingyas in Myanmar further stressed the need for Indian courts ""to proceed on clear legal categories, not slogans or political labels"", the statement said.It said that ""against this backdrop, the judiciary's intervention has been firmly within constitutional bounds"". The CJI Kant-led bench's observations struck a balance between safeguarding national security and upholding human dignity, the statement said.""To convert such a constitutionally compliant approach into a charge of inhumanity is unfair to the CJI and damaging to the institution,"" the former judges cautioned, adding that judicial independence would be at risk if every judicial question on nationality, migration, documentation or border security was met with accusations of hate or prejudice.","Forty-four former judges have issued a joint statement strongly condemning ""a motivated campaign"" against cji surya kant. The statement said that while judicial proceedings may legitimately invite reasoned criticism, there were attempts to ""delegitimise the judiciary"" the signatories highlighted rohingyas have not been admitted to india under any statutory refugee-protection framework.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125900242,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-564876,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
