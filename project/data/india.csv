NEW DELHI: West Bengal BJP president and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar on Wednesday DGP Rajeev Kumar at Bhawani Bhawan in Kolkata, accompanied by victims of recent violence incidents in Murshidabad. After the meeting, Majumdar claimed that the ""call for riots was given from the loudspeaker of the masjid.""""... According to the victims, the call for riots was given from the loudspeaker of the masjid,"" BJP leader said, citing victims' accounts.Taking aim at Trinamool Congress-led state government, Majumdar further added, ""... The provocative statement made by Tawha Siddique is very shameful. This mentality is increasing with their percentage increase and change in demographics. This mentality is because they are being sheltered by Mamata Banerjee's government.""He said that a BJP-led government would not tolerate the misuse of religious institutions. ""If the BJP comes to power, the party will ban any religious place used for such activities,"" he said.The Union minister also alleged that the Popular Front of India (PFI) was active in Murshidabad, yet no arrests had been made by the state police. ""The victims of the violence have travelled a long way to reach Kolkata to tell the world what happened in Murshidabad,"" he added.Majumdar claimed that many residents from the violence-hit areas of Murshidabad and Shamsherganj have fled to Malda and are now living in refugee camps. ""After the riots in Murshidabad's Shamsherganj, people migrated to Malda and are living in refugee camps. 11 people from there have come here to express their pain and suffering before the people of the state,"" he told ANI.The violence reportedly erupted on April 11 during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act—a controversial law that has drawn criticism in parts of the state. In response, over 150 people have been arrested, and police presence has been strengthened in areas including Samserganj and Dhuliyan.Earlier on the same day, leader of opposition in Bengal, Suvendu Adhikari accused TMC leaders of orchestrating the communal violence . In a video statement shared on X, he named Dhulian Municipality chairman Md Inzamul Haque as a ""key instigator"".""There is clear evidence in the video that this person is involved in the riots. He should be arrested immediately and severely punished for this heinous crime. Why are they being left out?"" Adhikari said.He alleged a broader conspiracy, saying, ""From Mothabari to Dhulian, Trinamool Congress leaders are the main conspirators and catalysts of anti-Hindu riots. Such toxic politics of the Trinamool Congress is just an attempt to endanger Hindus and enrich their vote bank.""""They are the ones who are disturbing the peace by spreading hatred in society and inciting fundamentalists. Their hate speech and activities are directly responsible for creating riots. It is time to unmask these rioters!"" he added.Meanwhile, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee held a meeting with Muslim clerics in Kolkata, amid the ongoing protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act.","West bengal bjp president and union minister sukanta majumdar met with dgp rajeev kumar in kolkata.

'Take up the matter with Saudi urgently': Stalin asks PM Modi to intervene on cancellation of 'private Haj' quota,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/take-up-the-matter-with-saudi-arabia-urgently-stalin-asks-pm-modi-to-intervene-on-cancellation-of-private-haj-quota/articleshow/120363339.cms,"PM Modi and Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin (R)

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister and DMK president MK Stalin on Wednesday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, outlining concern over the sudden cancellation of the Private Haj quota and urging PM to ""take up the matter with Saudi Arabia immediately"" to resolve the issue.In his letter, Stalin drew attention to the distress faced by thousands of Indian Muslim pilgrims , including many from Tamil Nadu, who had been preparing for the upcoming Haj pilgrimage.""I am writing this letter to bring to your attention a matter of urgent concern regarding the sudden cancellation of the Private Haj quota that is causing significant distress among thousands of Indian Muslim pilgrims, including many from Tamil Nadu, who are eagerly preparing for the upcoming Haj pilgrimage,"" Stalin said in the letter.He also highlighted the spiritual importance of Haj, saying, ""As you are aware, the Haj is one of the five pillars of Islam, representing a deeply sacred and once-in-a-lifetime religious duty for Muslims. The pilgrimage holds immense spiritual significance, and pilgrims often spend their lifetime savings to undertake this journey. This year, the Haj is expected to take place from June 4 to June 9, with pilgrims likely to begin their travel to Saudi Arabia in the month of May 2025.""The chief minister provided context on the current year's arrangements, stating that around 1.75 lakh Indian pilgrims had participated in the Haj pilgrimage in 2024.""During 2024, around 1,75,000 Indian Pilgrims partook in Haj pilgrimage. In January 2025, India signed a bilateral agreement with Saudi Arabia, finalising a quota of 1,75,025 pilgrims. The said quota was divided into a ratio of 70:30 among State Haj Committees and Private Haj Tour Operators. Accordingly, State Haj Committees were allotted 122,517 seats, and Private Haj Tour Operators were allotted 52,507 seats for Haj 2025. I am given to understand that there has been a sudden reduction in India's Haj quota by Saudi Arabia; approximately 52,000 Haj seats earmarked for private Haj tour operators have been cancelled. This abrupt decision has left many pilgrims, who have already completed payments, in a state of deep anxiety and uncertainty,"" he wrote.Stalin concluded the letter by requesting the Prime Minister's prompt involvement to help restore the quota and provide relief to the affected pilgrims.""Considering the gravity of this situation, I request that the matter be taken up with the authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia urgently and seek an expeditious remedy. I am sure that your intervention will restore the Haj quota and provide reassurance to the pilgrims and their families,"" he added.Several Muslim pilgrims and community leaders have also sought PM Modi's intervention after minority affairs ministry confirmed that 42,000 applicants won't be able to perform Haj in June this year.","Tamil nadu chief minister and dmk president mk stalin wrote to prime minister narendra modi.

SC on Urdu use: Language shouldn't divide society,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-on-urdu-use-language-shouldnt-divide-society/articleshow/120361050.cms,"Supreme Court of India

NEW DELHI: At a time when language has become politicised, with incidents of people being attacked in several states for not speaking the local language, Supreme Court has said India's linguistic diversity should be celebrated and it should not cause divisions. It said language was not related to any religion and Urdu was as much an Indian language as Hindi and Marathi, reports Amit Anand Choudhary. SC upheld use of Urdu, along with Marathi, on a signboard of Patur municipal council in Maharashtra's Akola district.T he court said there was a misconception that Urdu was alien to India and observed that it was “pitiable” to consider Hindi as the language of Hindus and Urdu of Muslims, a ploy used by the colonial powers to divide the country. “The prejudice against Urdu stems from the misconception that Urdu is alien to India. This opinion, we are afraid, is incorrect as Urdu, like Marathi and Hindi, is an IndoAryan language. It is a language which was born in this land. Urdu developed and flourished in India due to the need for people belonging to different cultural milieus who wanted to exchange ideas and communicate amongst themselves. Over the centuries, it attained ever greater refinement and became the language of choice for many acclaimed poets,” a bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and K Vinod Chandra said.“Language is not religion. Language does not even represent religion. Language belongs to a community, to a region, to people; and not to a religion. Language is culture. Language is the yardstick to measure the civilisational march of a community and its people. So is the case of Urdu, which is the finest specimen of Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb, or the Hindustani tehzeeb, which is the composite cultural ethos of the plains of northern and central India,” the bench said.Noting that a petitioner fought a legal battle against Urdu for the last five years before Bombay HC and SC, the court said the petitioner’s misconception over the issue of language should be addressed as many other people may also have the same feeling. The court said language was a medium for exchange of ideas that brought people holding diverse views and beliefs closer and it should not become a cause of their division.The bench said even today, the Hindi used by common people was replete with Urdu words, even if one was not aware of it. “It would not be incorrect to say that one cannot have a day-today conversation in Hindi without using words of Urdu or words derived from Urdu. The word ‘Hindi’ itself comes from the Persian word ‘Hindavi’. This exchange of vocabulary flows both ways because Urdu also has many words borrowed from other Indian languages, including Sanskrit,” it said. The court said Urdu and Hindi were not two languages as per linguists and literary scholars and if Urdu was criticised, it was also a criticism of Hindi in a way. It expressed concern over deterioration of Hindustani language which is a mix of various languages including Hindi and Urdu .“This is not an occasion to have an elaborate discussion on the rise and fall of Urdu, but this much can be stated that this fusion of Hindi and Urdu met a roadblock in the form of puritans on both sides and Hindi became more Sanskritised and Urdu more Persian. A schism exploited by the colonial powers in dividing the two languages on religion. Hindi was now understood to be the language of Hindus and Urdu of Muslims, which is such a pitiable digression from reality; from unity in diversity; and the concept of universal brotherhood,” the bench said. “We must respect and rejoice in our diversity, including our many languages. India has more than 100 major languages,” it added. The court said if people or a group of people residing within the area covered by the Patur municipal council were familiar with Urdu, then there should not be any objection if Urdu was used in addition to the official language, ie, Marathi, at least on the signboard of the municipal council.","Supreme court of india upholds use of urdu, along with marathi, on a signboard of patur municipal council in maharashtra's akola district. Justices sudhanshu dhulia and k vinod chandra said there was a misconception that urdu was alien to india.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120361393,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-101670,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

What did SC say?



On Bengal violence



'Waqf by user is an established practice of Islam'



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday heard a batch of petitions against the Waqf (Amendment) Act and various points of contention concerning the law, including "" waqf by user "", inclusion of non-Muslims on the board and also the violence in Bengal's Murshidabad that broke out during the protest against the law.During the hearing, the Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sanjiv Khanna-led bench, which included Justices Sanjay Kumar and KV Viswanathan, asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta , appearing for the Centre, on how ""waqf by user"" can be disallowed as many will not have the requisite documents to get such waqfs registered.The phrase ""Waqf by user"" refers to land or property that has been treated as waqf over time through continuous public or religious use, even if no formal waqf deed exists.""How will you register such waqfs by user? What documents will they have? It will lead to undoing something. Yes, there is some misuse. But there are genuine ones also. I have gone through privy council judgments also. Waqf by user is recognised. If you undo it then it will be a problem. Legislature cannot declare a judgment, order or decree as void. You can only take the basis,"" the bench said, according to news agency PTI.""The properties declared by courts as waqfs should not be de-notified as waqfs, whether they are by waqf-by-user or waqf by deed, while the court is hearing the challenge to the Waqf Amendment Act 2025,"" the bench added.Mehta submitted that there was a large section of Muslims who did not want to be governed by Waqf act.The bench then asked Mehta, ""Are you saying that from now on you will allow Muslims to be part of the Hindu endowment boards. Say it openly.""The apex court said that when a public trust was declared to be a Waqf 100 or 200 years ago, it couldn't suddenly be taken over by the waqf board and declared otherwise.""You cannot rewrite the past,"" the bench said.Mehta submitted that a joint parliamentary committee had 38 sittings and examined 98.2 lakh memorandums before Parliament's both houses passed it.The Supreme Court on Wednesday said the violence occurring during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025 is ""very disturbing"".""One thing that is very disturbing is the violence that is taking place. If the matter is pending here then it should not happen,"" the CJI said.Echoing a similar sentiment, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said, ""They (protesters) think they can pressurise the system by this.""At least three people were killed and hundreds were rendered homeless in communal violence in parts of Murshidabad district, mainly Suti, Samserganj, Dhulian and Jangipur, on April 11 and 12 during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act.Senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi, opposing Waqf Act, said Waqf by user was an established practice of Islam and couldn't be taken away.Kapil Sibal, appearing for the petitioners referred to Waqf Amendment Act and said was challenging the provision that says only Muslims could create Waqf.""How can state decide whether, and how I am a Muslim or not and hence, eligible to create Waqf?"" Sibal asked.He added, ""How can government say only those who are practising Islam for last five years can create Waqf?""Senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, who represented some of the petitioners, submitted that Waqf Act would have all India ramifications and pleas should not be referred to the high court.The bench on Wednesday did not issue a formal notice and said it would resume hearing on the petitions at around 2 pm on April 17.","The supreme court on wednesday heard a batch of petitions against the waqf (amendment) act, 2025.

What SC said on inclusion of non-Muslim in Waqf council?



What SC said on violent protests against Waqf Act?



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday heard multiple petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025.It noted that undoing ""waqf by user"" would create several issues and sought the central government's reply to over 100 petitions challenging the Act. However, it refused to put a stay on the operation of the law.On inclusion of non-Muslim members in the Central and state Waqf boards, the apex court asked if the BJP-led Centre would ""allow Muslims to be part of Hindu religious trusts"". It ruled that ex-officio members could be appointed regardless of religion but others had to be Muslims.The court is set to hear the matter at 2pm on Thursday.The top court noted that most of the mosques were built during 14th and 15th century and and producing a ""registered deed"" was impossible.""Many of the masjids are created in 14th or 15th centuries. To require them to produce a registered deed is impossible. Most of the cases, say Jama Masjid Delhi, the waqf will be waqf-by-user,"" CJI Sanjiv Khanna said. ""If you are going to de-notify waqf-by-user properties, it will be an issue,"" he added.Kapil Sibal had argued that the abolition of the 'waqf by user' provision struck at the core of religious practice, asserting, ""Its my integral part of religion, its recognised in Ram Janbhoomi judgment. Problem is, they will say if a waqf is created 3000 years ago, they will ask for deed.""The removal of the provision is another point of contention driving the anti-Waqf protests . Under the Waqf Act of 1954, properties could be designated as waqf if they had long been used for religious or charitable purposes, even in the absence of official documentation. The amendment does away with this classification, raising concerns and ambiguity over the legal status of many such properties.The apex court has sought clarification over non-Muslim members in the Waqf council. ""Will you allow Muslims to be part of Hindu religious trusts,"" it asked. It said that ex-officio members could be appointed regardless of their faith but others members had to be Muslims.According to the Act, in the Central Waqf Council, up to two of the 22 appointed (non-ex officio) members may be individuals from non-Muslim communities. State Waqf Boards may include up to two non-Muslim members among the 11 appointed (non-ex officio) positions.Addressing the anti-Waqf protests that turned violent in Bengal's Murshidabad killing three, SC said that it was ""very disturbed"".""Once Supreme Court is seized of the matter, this should not happen,"" the CJI said.Violent protests erupted in Murshidabad on April 11 over the contentious Waqf (Amendment) Act, leading to the deaths of three individuals, injuries to many others, and significant property damage.According to the West Bengal Police, 150 people have been arrested so far in connection with the violence, and security has been stepped up with heavy police deployment in affected areas such as Samserganj and Dhuliyan.The BJP-led central government recently notified the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, following its passage in Parliament amid intense debates in both houses. The bill received President Droupadi Murmu’s assent on April 5. It was approved in the Lok Sabha with 288 votes in favour and 232 against, while in the Rajya Sabha, it passed with 128 members supporting and 95 opposing it.However, a total of 72 petitions have been filed challenging the validity of the Act. Petitioners include AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi , the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, the DMK, and Congress MPs Imran Pratapgarhi and Mohammad Jawed. In response, the Centre filed a caveat in the Supreme Court on April 8, requesting to be heard before any orders are issued.","Supreme court on wednesday heard multiple petitions challenging constitutional validity of the waqf (amendment) act, 2025.

Waqf case: Supreme Court may pass 3-point interim order after Thursday hearing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/waqf-case-supreme-court-may-pass-3-point-interim-order-after-thursday-hearing/articleshow/120348740.cms,"The 3-point interim order includes:



NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday paused its planned interim order on the amended Waqf law after the Centre requested more time to respond to three key questions raised by the bench.The matter will resume before the three-judge bench on Thursday at 2 PM.The bench comprising CJI Sanjiv Khanna, Justice Sanjay Kumar and Justice K V Viswanathan had earlier considered transferring the cases to a high court.However, they proceeded to hear extensive arguments from senior counsels including Kapil Sibal, Abhishek Singhvi, Rajeev Dhavan and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre.The top court contemplated issuing the 3-point interim order regarding petitions challenging the Waqf Amendment Act 2025 and proposed temporary directions ahead of Thursday’s hearing.1) ""Properties declared by the courts as waqfs should not be de-notified as waqfs, whether they are by waqf-by-user or waqf by deed, while the court is hearing the challenge to the Waqf Amendment Act 2025."""" Waqf by user "" refers to a practice where a property is recognised as a religious or charitable endowment (waqf) based on its long-term, uninterrupted use for such purposes, even if there isn't a formal, written declaration of waqf by the owner.2) The Amendment Act provision stating that a Waqf property would not be considered as Waqf during a Collector's inquiry into government land status should not be implemented.3) ""All Members of the waqf boards and central waqf Council must be Muslims, except the ex-officio members.""The court questioned the registration process for waqfs by user and the documentation requirements. The bench noted that whilst misuse exists, legitimate cases also need protection.""How will you register such waqfs by user? What documents will they have? It will lead to undoing something. Yes, there is some misuse. But there are genuine ones also. I have gone through privy council judgments also. Waqf by user is recognised. If you undo it then it will be a problem. Legislature cannot declare a judgment, order or decree as void. You can only take the basis,"" the bench asked.Solicitor General Mehta indicated that numerous Muslims preferred not to be governed by the Waqf act. The court responded by questioning, ""Are you saying that from now on you will allow Muslims to be part of the Hindu endowment boards? Say it openly.""The bench stressed that historical trusts declared as waqfs cannot be arbitrarily altered. ""You cannot rewrite the past,"" the bench added.Mehta noted that a joint parliamentary committee held 38 sessions and reviewed 98.2 lakh memorandums before parliamentary approval.The Chief Justice outlined two primary considerations: “Firstly, whether we should entertain or relegate it to the high court?Secondly, point out in brief what you are really urging and wanting to argue? We are not saying there is any bar on SC in hearing, deciding pleas against the law.""The Centre filed a caveat in the Supreme Court, requesting that no order be passed without giving it a chance to be heard on April 8.

Poll Should the government have the authority to determine the eligibility of individuals to create waqf? No, it infringes on personal rights. Yes, it ensures regulations.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Centre whether Muslims would now be allowed to be part of Hindu religious trusts , as it heard a batch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025.A bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justices Sanjay Kumar and K V Viswanathan raised several questions on the Act, particularly about the practice of "" waqf by user "", where a property is considered waqf based on long-standing religious or charitable use, even without formal documentation.""How will you register such waqfs by user? What documents will they have? It will lead to undoing something. Yes, there is some misuse. But there are genuine ones also. I have gone through privy council judgments also. Waqf by user is recognised. If you undo it then it will be a problem,"" the bench said.Appearing for the Centre, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said a large section of Muslims did not want to be governed by the Waqf Act . This led the bench to ask, ""Are you saying that from now on you will allow Muslims to be part of the Hindu endowment boards. Say it openly.""The court observed that properties declared waqf a century ago could not be arbitrarily reclassified. ""Legislature cannot declare a judgment, order or decree as void. You can only take the basis,"" it noted.Chief Justice Khanna said the court would consider whether the matter should be heard by the Supreme Court or referred to a high court. He also asked both sides to clearly spell out the core legal issues they wished to raise.""There are two aspects we want to ask both the sides to address. Firstly, whether we should entertain or relegate it to the high court? Secondly, point out in brief what you are really urging and wanting to argue?"" We are not saying there is any bar on SC in hearing, deciding pleas against the law,"" the CJI said.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal , representing the petitioners, argued that the provision allowing only Muslims to create waqf was unconstitutional. ""How can state decide whether, and how I am a Muslim or not and hence, eligible to create waqf?"" Sibal asked.He added, ""How can government say only those who are practising Islam for last five years can create waqf?""Senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, also representing petitioners, said the Act had nationwide implications and should not be transferred to any high court. Senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi added that ""waqf by user"" was a long-standing Islamic practice and could not be dismissed.The Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, received presidential assent on April 5 after being passed in both houses of Parliament amid heated debates. In the Rajya Sabha, 128 members supported the bill while 95 opposed it. In the Lok Sabha, the bill was passed with 288 votes in favour and 232 against.A total of 72 petitions have been filed challenging the Act, including those by AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi, All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, DMK, and Congress MPs Imran Pratapgarhi and Mohammad Jawed.The Centre has filed a caveat in the apex court seeking a hearing before any interim order is passed.","The waqf (amendment) act, 2025, received presidential assent on april 5.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday addressed the tense situation in Murshidabad district in her meeting with Imams. She also responded to the allegations pushed by the BJP leaders, which claimed TMC 's involvement in unrest over Waqf issue.Mamata hit back at the BJP-led Centre, alleging "" Communal riot in Murshidabad pre-planned.""“Had TMC been involved in the Waqf violence as claimed by the opposition, the houses of our leaders wouldn’t have been attacked,” she said. She also pointed out that the TMC had taken a strong stand in Parliament against the Waqf law. “TMC is at the forefront in the fight against the Waqf law,” Banerjee stated during a meeting with Imams.She added: ""Yesterday, I saw a tweet from ANI quoting the Home Ministry that Bangladesh is involved in this ( Murshidabad violence ). If this is true, the Central Govt is responsible for it. BSF takes care of the border and not the state govt. Why did you allow the people of BJP to come from outside, cause a disturbance and run away?""Taking aim at the Centre and sections of the media, Banerjee accused “godi media” of spreading misinformation and targeting Bengal unfairly. “The Centre hiked petrol and diesel prices, but some 'godi media' only speak against Bengal and against me,” she said, challenging critics to speak to her directly instead of spreading misinformation.She alleged that some media houses backed by the BJP had circulated fake videos to defame the state. “We have nabbed them... Out of eight videos, some are from Karnataka, some from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, or Rajasthan. They are tarnishing Bengal. They should be ashamed,” the CM said.Banerjee also questioned the central government’s record on employment and inflation: “They should answer how many youths have got jobs. The prices of medicines, petrol, and diesel have increased, but instead, they’re busy targeting Bengal with fake narratives.”Earlier in the day, the BJP sharpened its attack on Bengal CM Mamata over the violence in Murshidabad, accusing her government of orchestrating a “targeted attack” on the Hindu community.At a presser, BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad questioned the state government's intentions, saying, “What’s happening in Bengal? How low will they stoop for vote banks? What does it mean that Hindus are fleeing?” He cited television visuals showing shops owned by Hindus being set on fire and described the violence as deliberate.“One report showed a poor Dalit man who had saved Rs 2 lakh for his wife’s treatment — all of it was burnt. This is inhumane,” he said, slamming the Mamata government for what he called a total lack of sensitivity. “Politics will happen, but has your government lost all humanity?” he asked.Prasad further alleged that the police in Bengal were operating without accountability and praised the intervention of the high court, which led to the deployment of central forces in the area.","Mamata hit back at the bjp-led centre, alleging "" communal riot in murshidabad pre-planned. “had tmc been involved in the waqf violence as claimed by the opposition, the houses of our leaders wouldn’t have been attacked,” she said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120336635,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-836079,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

BJP counters with ‘corporate conspiracy’ allegation

What is the National Herald Case?

What happens next?

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police on Wednesday detained several Congress workers protesting outside the All India Congress Committee headquarters at 24, Akbar Road. The protest erupted after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) filed a chargesheet in the National Herald case , naming senior party leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi as key accused.The detained protesters were demonstrating against what they called a ""politically motivated"" move by the Centre to target opposition leaders using investigative agencies. The ED filed its prosecution complaint at Delhi’s Rouse Avenue Court under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002.The protest, which took place in front of the Congress headquarters, saw participation from several senior leaders.Sachin Pilot, former Rajasthan deputy CM, said, “We are seeing this case for a long time. There is no transaction, no transfer of property, no asset movement. I have full faith in the judiciary. This is being done only to divert public attention. Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi will fight legally and politically. The BJP is feeling threatened because we are reviving the party in Gujarat. This is a clear misuse of the ED.”Imran Pratapgarhi, Congress MP and minority cell chairman, said the timing of the chargesheet was suspicious. “You have to understand the chronology—Rahul Gandhi is in Gujarat, Bihar elections are coming, BJP is nervous about Assam, and suddenly this chargesheet appears. This is an attempt to crush the opposition, but they forget this is the Gandhi family—whose sacrifices for the country are unparalleled,” Pratapgarhi said.Supriya Shrinate, Congress spokesperson, launched a scathing attack on the Modi government saying, “This is a 12-year-old case. The government waited till the last day to file the chargesheet, which shows how legally and morally bankrupt they are. No money has exchanged hands. This is a desperate attempt to trap the Gandhi family. Modi is scared of Rahul Gandhi. But vendetta politics will take them only so far. We will fight this in court and on the streets.”Udit Raj, another party leader, called the chargesheet “fake and illegal”. “We want to go to the public. No one is bigger than the people. The people must know this chargesheet is completely baseless.”Congress has announced nationwide protests against the move, particularly in front of ED offices across the country.In a press conference held in Delhi, senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad defended the ED’s action and hit back at Congress.“Congress has the right to protest, but they do not have the right to loot land and public funds. This entire case is about misappropriation of funds and assets. In 2008, the National Herald ceased publication. After that, Congress gave ?90 crore to Associated Journals Ltd (AJL), the publisher. This was a clear violation because party funds cannot be given to a private company.”He further alleged, “Young India Ltd was then created, with 38% share each held by Sonia and Rahul Gandhi. This was a corporate conspiracy to grab the assets of AJL. Properties in Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow, Patna, and Bhopal—valuable properties—were transferred to Young India. And what charity has Young India done since then? None.”Prasad accused the Congress of misleading the public and using protests to distract from the real legal issues.The National Herald was a newspaper founded by Jawaharlal Nehru in 1938, published by AJL. In 2008, AJL stopped publishing. Later, in 2010, Congress leaders created Young Indian Pvt. Ltd. , a company in which Sonia and Rahul Gandhi hold the majority stake.BJP leader Subramanian Swamy filed a private complaint in 2012 alleging that Congress provided Rs 90 crore in loans to AJL, which was later acquired by Young India for a paltry Rs 50 lakh. He alleged this allowed Young India, and by extension the Gandhi family, to effectively control real estate assets worth over Rs 2,000 crore.The ED began investigating under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. On Tuesday, it filed a prosecution complaint (chargesheet) naming Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and others, including Motilal Vora and Oscar Fernandes.The complaint has been filed under Sections 44 and 45 of the PMLA, for offences under Section 3 (money laundering), Section 70 (offences by companies), and Section 4 (punishment for money laundering).The chargesheet will now be taken up by the Delhi court, and summons may be issued to the accused. Congress has announced continued protests, claiming it will “not be silenced.” Meanwhile, BJP leaders insist the law must take its course and that no one is above the law.","Police detain congress workers who were protesting against central government and central agencies, outside their party office.
