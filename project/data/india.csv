Why BJP-Shiv Sena alliance talks fell apart in 2014? Devendra Fadnavis reveals what happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-bjp-shiv-sena-alliance-talks-fell-apart-in-2014-devendra-fadnavis-reveals-what-happened/articleshow/119451321.cms,"NEW DELHI: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis explained why the Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena decided to part ways in 2014 state assembly elections. The saffron party leader revealed that seat-sharing disagreements were the primary reason behind the failure of alliance talks with Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena.""When the talks of alliance started, the Shiv Sena of that time had decided in its mind that it had to contest only 151 seats. Whereas our proposal was that we would contest on 127 seats and Shiv Sena would contest on 147 seats, we would give the remaining seats to our smaller alliance partners,"" he said speaking at an event in Mumbai.Fadnavis later revealed that the BJP had proposed a power-sharing arrangement where Shiv Sena would retain the chief minister's post. However, according to him, Shiv Sena was unwilling to compromise, leading to a deadlock in the negotiations.""Due to this reason, the matter could not move forward even though we explained to them a lot that we would contest on 127, and you contest on 147, you would have the chief minister, and we would have the deputy chief minister... They were not ready to have a settlement...,"" he added.In the 2014 Maharashtra assembly elections, both the BJP and the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena contested separately.The BJP secured 122 seats, paving the way for Devendra Fadnavis to become the state's chief minister. Although the BJP and Shiv Sena had contested separately, they later joined forces post-election, with Shiv Sena becoming a key ally in the government.Thackeray's move to break ties with the BJP and form alliance with the Congress and NCP sparked internal dissent within Shiv Sena, ultimately fueling a rebellion led by Eknath Shinde.With the backing of BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis, Shinde orchestrated a split within the Shiv Sena in 2022 and aligned with the BJP to establish an NDA government.",Bharatiya janata party and shiv sena decided to part ways in 2014 state assembly elections.

How is this acceptable?"" asked Shashi Tharoor, Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram.Initiating the debate on the Finance Bill in Lok Sabha, Tharoor claimed that the bill was yet another move by the Centre to hoard revenue at the states' expense by slashing basic customs duty on several items which are shared with states and shifting the difference to the Agricultural Infrastructure and Development Cess (AIDC), which the Centre keeps entirely.The Thiruvananthapuram MP demanded the constitution of an independent fiscal council to serve as a redressal body, ensuring that the States have a say in how their hard-earned revenue is allocated.DMK MP Kalanidhi Veeraswamy alleged BJP-led Centre presented the Finance Bill for announcing tax exemption for those earning up to Rs 12 lakh in view of the Delhi elections. ""They have achieved their aim and won in the Delhi assembly elections. So, I would like to congratulate them on their efforts,"" Veeraswamy said, in a sarcastic manner, and went on to add that Tamil Nadu does not get its fair share from tax collected by the Centre.""If you look at the statistics over the last 10 years, Tamil Nadu has paid about Rs 8 lakh crore in the form of direct taxes, but the devolution which has come back to Tamil Nadu is only about Rs. 2.4 lakh crore.

BJP members reacted vociferously to what they called Congress's conspiracy to change the Constitution to give religion-based quota to appease the minority community.Congress and Shivakumar denied that he had made such a statement and said govt functionaries were peddling lies to stall Parliament, but BJP's protests continued.Raising the issue in Lok Sabha, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said, ""A senior member of Congress, who is sitting on a constitutional position, has said that Muslims will be given reservation by changing the Constitution."" Amid uproar from opposition benches, the speaker adjourned the House for the second time since it assembled in the morning, till 2 pm.Rijiju said there was no place for reservation in the Constitution based on religion, and cited the demands made by the Muslim League in 1947 when Sardar Patel and the entire House had rejected religion-based quota. The minister demanded removal of the Congress member. .Ruckus continued in Rajya Sabha post-lunch as leader of the House J P Nadda and leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge engaged in a verbal duel over the issue.Nadda accused Congress of trying to create reservation for Muslims through the back door by cutting into the OBC quota, an allegation denied by Kharge, who said Shivakumar had never made any such statement.In a way, it was a re-run of the fight between the two sides during the campaign for 2024 LS polls where PM Modi had alleged that Congress was planning to smuggle in a Muslim quota, while Congress had accused of him of seeking a 400-plus tally so that the Constitution could be amended to get rid of caste quotas.The post-lunch sitting of RS, which followed two adjournments in the first half, started with Congress MPs raising a din and accusing the govt of misleading the House and twisting Shivakumar's words.An incensed Nadda got up to protest Karnataka govt's decision to give Muslims 4% reservation in public contracts, reminding the opposition benches that both B R Ambedkar and Sardar Patel had spoken against extending reservation on the basis of religion.""Earlier, Telangana assembly approved quota for Muslims by depriving SCs/STs/OBCs of their entitlement. They tried to create a back door entry for Muslims into the OBC quota. History is witness. And now they are introducing a quota for Muslims even in public contracts,"" Nadda said.The row was triggered by Shivakumar's purported reply at a media event where he was asked whether the Constitution allowed reservation based on religion. In response, Shivakumar purportedly said, ""Let's wait and see what the court decides. We have started something. I know everyone will go to court... A good day will come. Many changes are happening.

But will the law be fairly and equally deployed against those who have decided that vandalism is the appropriate response to being offended by a joke? And against the unelected members of the BMC, who have arrived today at Habitat, without prior notice, and tore the place down with hammers? Perhaps for my next venue, I will opt for Elphinstone bridge, or any other structure in Mumbai that's in need of speedy demolition.""Addressing those leaking his personal contact details, he said: ""To those who are busy leaking my number or calling me incessantly: I am sure you've realised by now that all unknown calls go to my voicemail, where you will be subjected to the very song that you hate.

'Step in the right direction': Dhankhar praises CJI



'Not a trash bin'



NEW DELHI: The Allahabad HC Bar association has strongly opposed the Supreme Court's decision to transfer Justice Yashwant Varma from Delhi high court to Allahabad high court, amid the recovery of a substantial amount of cash from his official residence after a fire incident on March 14.After a general house meeting in Prayagraj on Monday, Anil Tiwari, Allahabad HC Bar president, condemned the move and demanded further action. ""We have passed 11 proposals. First, we will not tolerate his (Justice Yashwant Varma) transfer here under any circumstances; it did not happen today, nor should it happen in the future,"" he said.He further urged the CJI to allow investigating agencies to take action. ""We request the Chief Justice of India to permit the CBI and ED to file an FIR against him and conduct a trial, as is done for any political leader or bureaucrat, since the incident is not part of any judicial function.""Tiwari also called for impeachment proceedings against Justice Varma. ""We have requested the government to initiate the impeachment process, which should proceed as soon as possible to prevent any attempts to destroy evidence. We have also questioned the appointment system, stating that it is unfair. The collegium system only provides opportunities to well-connected individuals.""The Supreme Court Collegium, led by the CJI Sanjiv Khanna along with four senior-most judges, issued a resolution recommending Justice Varma’s transfer back to his parent court, the Allahabad high court.The Collegium reviewed the transfer proposal on March 20. The top court has clarified that the transfer is unrelated to the in-house inquiry initiated by the Chief Justice of the Delhi high court regarding the cash recovery.Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar praised CJI Khanna for upholding judicial transparency amid the ongoing controversy.Dhankhar mentioned that, for the first time since Independence, a Chief Justice has publicly disclosed all relevant material without withholding any information.""This is a step in the right direction. The formation of a committee by the Chief Justice and his vigilance are also noteworthy. Institutions like the judiciary and legislature function best when their internal mechanisms are efficient, prompt, and uphold public trust,"" he added.This is not the first time the Allahabad HC Bar association has opposed the transfer. Last week, it wrote to Chief Justice Arun Bhansali, stating that the Allahabad HC is ""not a trash bin."" The association linked the decision to broader concerns about the judicial appointment and transfer system, arguing that it had weakened public faith in the rule of law.Justice Yashwant Varma, in his response to the inquiry panel, has denied any wrongdoing, calling the allegations an attempt to malign him. In a letter to the Chief Justice of the Delhi HC, he stated that neither he nor his family had any connection to the cash allegedly discovered at the site.",The allahabad hc bar association has strongly opposed the supreme court's decision to transfer justice yashwant varma from delhi high court to allahabad high court.

NEW DELHI: Two months after it conducted searches on the premises of a railway claims tribunal judge in Patna, R K Mittal, and his associates in a case of Rs 50 crore fraudulent withdrawal of death compensations, ED on Friday attached 24 properties belonging to the accused.This was not the first time the agency had acted against a judge accused of alleged bribery or association with fraudsters engaged in fixing benches and cultivating judges for favourable judgments. Apart from the known instances, the agency is also learned to be keeping a close surveillance on conflicts of interest of judges and alleged efforts to bribe them.On Aug 10 in 2023, ED arrested Panchkula's former special court judge Sudhir Parmar in connection with alleged bribery and for favouring accused in a money laundering case against real estate developer IREO and its promoter Lalit Goyal.Goyal was arrested by the agency just a month before it took Parmar into custody. Panchkula's special CBI court judge was suspended by Punjab and Haryana high court in April that year after agencies produced ""incriminating evidence"" against him for allegedly favouring the IREO promoters accused in a money laundering investigation .ED later arrested Goyal's associates and promoters of M3M, Basant Bansal and Pankaj Bansal, in a separate case. ED in its remand note had claimed that ""Sudhir Parmar (the Panchkula judge) was showing favouritism to the accused Roop Bansal, his brother Basant Bansal, the owners of M3M, and Lalit Goyal, the owner of IREO Group, in lieu of undue advantages"".In yet another case, while probing the Chhattisgarh PDS scam pertaining to the period of the previous Congress-led govt of Bhupesh Baghel, ED came across evidence of alleged liaisoning between two senior IAS officers who were accused in the case and a judge of the Chhattisgarh high court influencing the trial.ED brought the issue to the notice of Supreme Court, which transferred the judge in question to Patna high court, an action similar to what the SC collegium had proposed in case of a judge of Delhi high court after alleged recovery of a huge pile of cash from his residence.In the case of Chhattisgarh HC judge, as reported by TOI, ED had told SC that two IAS officers, Anil Tuteja and Alok Shukla, ""were in touch with the high court judge who granted bail to Shukla"". The agency further alleged that the then advocate general of the state had been liaising between the two accused and the judge, indirectly alleging quid pro quo in relief granted to the babus under investigation in the PDS scam.","Ed acts against judge in rs 50cr payout scam, seizes 24 assets.

NEW DELHI: A CCTV video from the office of controversial preacher Bajinder Singh has surfaced online, showing him physically assaulting multiple individuals, including a woman with a child.The footage was reportedly recorded in February 2025 and has triggered massive outrage, with critics calling for strict action against the self-styled Christian prophet .In the viral video, Singh is first seen throwing a mobile phone at an employee before approaching and slapping him. Moments later, he is seen attacking a woman who had come to his office with her child.As seen in the footage, he first threw a pile of papers at her before pushing her during an altercation. The incident quickly escalated into a heated argument, with others in the office intervening to separate them.The footage comes at a time when Bajinder Singh is already under investigation in a sexual harassment case.As per PTI, a 22-year-old woman accused the pastor of harassment, stating that he took her mobile number and began sending her messages.From 2022, Singh allegedly made her sit alone in a church cabin, where he hugged her and touched her inappropriately. She further claimed that he threatened to have her and her family eliminated if she reported him. The Punjab Police registered a case against Singh on February 28, booking him under Sections 354A (sexual harassment), 354D (stalking), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.Following the complaint, a three-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed, led by Superintendent of Police Rupinder Kaur, to probe the allegations. The National Commission for Women (NCW) has also taken cognizance of the matter and demanded swift action against Singh.Singh, however, has dismissed the allegations, calling them ""baseless.""Speaking to the media earlier, he said, ""Fake chats can be easily created these days. They should provide proof against me. Everyone in the church knows that she [the complainant] suffered from fits and was troubled by evil spirits. People come here for prayers, and our job is to pray. She is like our daughter"".Singh has a history of controversy. In 2018, he was arrested at Delhi airport over a sexual harassment case filed by a woman from Zirakpur. More recently, a Mohali court issued warrants against him in that case. In 2022, he was accused of taking money from a Delhi-based family for treating their daughter, who later died.The preacher has also been on the radar of tax authorities, with income tax raids conducted at his premises in 2023.Despite these allegations, Singh remains a well-known figure with a massive social media following. His YouTube channel, ""Prophet Bajinder Singh,"" has over 3.74 million subscribers, and his sermons often attract large crowds, both in India and abroad.Celebrities such as actors Chunky Pandey and Aditya Pancholi have previously endorsed him.","Cctv video shows self-styled christian prophet bajinder singh assaulting multiple individuals.

From 2020 to date, Centre has provided Rs 20,660 crore for road development of Ladakh,” Malhotra told journalists in Leh.The minister showcased progress on Bilaspur-Manali-Leh railway project with an Rs 1.31-lakh crore allocation. “At present, the journey from Delhi to Leh takes 40 hours (by road) but after the railway line is ready, it will reduce the distance to 20 hours,” Malhotra said. He added the Srinagar-Leh rail project had not been cancelled but put on hold.A major push for air connectivity is also on, with Rs 640 crore earmarked for a new terminal at Leh airport.With the chief executive of Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) Tashi Gyalson by his side, Malhotra mentioned a flurry of projects. These included Shinku La Tunnel. PM Narendra Modi inaugurated the Rs 1,200-crore project on July 26 last year. It involves a 4.1-km twin-tube structure built at 15,800ft. The tunnel on Nimu-Padum-Darcha Road will be completed in two years and connect Himachal Pradesh and Ladakh. It will provide all-weather connectivity to Leh, vital for both civilian and military requirements.“Road infrastructure continues to be a priority, with Rs 2,405 crore earmarked for the Nimu-Padam-Darcha Road. It will further strengthen Ladakh’s connectivity,” Malhotra said, listing other projects like Zanskar-Kargil road and Zoji La tunnel.","Road connectivity across ladakh has accelerated at an unprecedented pace for civilian and military needs.

Centre redflags plan to remove 3 names from Haryana SC list,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-redflags-plan-to-remove-3-names-from-haryana-sc-list/articleshow/119450146.cms,"NEW DELHI: Centre has waived a red flag at Haryana's decision to remove the names of three castes from the Scheduled Castes list and issue them caste certificates under other communities, telling the state that any inclusion to or exclusion from the SC list is the Parliament's prerogative. The state has also been told that a SC caste can only be given affirmative action benefits like reservation in its own name and not under any other group, even if it is part of the same sub-social bloc.The negative order is in response to Haryana's recent request to Centre that it should drop the names of 'Chura', 'Bhangi' and 'Mochi' from the list of SC communities for the state. As reported by TOI, the state has argued that the three names are ""objectionable and irrelevant"", in a move designed to end the usage of caste names that are widely deployed as pejoratives.To buttress its claim, Haryana had in its letter attached a 2013 state govt order in which it had announced that 'Chura, Bhangi' and 'Mochi' have been deleted from the local SC list, and the communities will be issued caste certificates in the name of 'Balmiki' and 'Chamar', respectively. The more than a decade old state govt order was addressed to all senior authorities of Haryana, especially the field administrators whose domain includes the process of issuing caste certificates.The proposal and the argument, however, have not found favour with Centre. Union social justice and empowerment ministry is learnt to have recently replied to Haryana that its 2013 order is ""impermissible"", and urged it to bring the circular in consonance with the Article 341 of the Constitution - which says that the power of inclusion in, and exclusion from, the SC list lies with the Parliament.","Haryana had asked centre to drop the names of 'chura', 'bhangi' and 'mochi' from the list of sc communities.
