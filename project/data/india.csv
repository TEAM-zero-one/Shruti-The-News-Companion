The party lost, all the senior leaders lost, and Atishi Marlena is celebrating like this?"" Maliwal asked.Earlier in the day as AAP inched closer to defeat, Maliwal shared a painting depicting the cheerharan (disrobing) episode of Draupadi from the epic Mahabharata.Maliwal has been increasingly vocal about her discontent with the party’s leadership.She was detained by Delhi Police after staging a protest outside Kejriwal's residence, demanding action on the government's failure to clean the Yamuna River.

In the Delhi Assembly election 2025 , several candidates who switched political parties must be in a happy mood as even after changing sides, they still managed to secure victories. The phenomenon of successful turncoats in elections remains a consistent feature of Indian politics.Several politicians saw the greener side and they are:In Gandhi Nagar, former Delhi Congress chief Arvinder Singh Lovely, now representing BJP, secured victory with a 12,748-vote margin against AAP's Naveen Chaudhary.Former AAP member Kamal Arora, now with Congress, finished third with 3,453 votes.Lovely joined the BJP in 2017 after a long stint with the Congress. The saffron party replaced its sitting MLA Anil K Bajpai with Lovely for this key constituency. His move drew sharp proved to be a right move for him.BJP's Tarwinder Singh Marwah, previously a three-term Congress MLA, defeated Manish Sisodia by 675 votes in Jangpura. Sisodia, who relocated from Patparganj, graciously accepted defeat and wished the victor success in serving the constituency.Marwah, who joined BJP after leaving Congress in 2022, had expressed dissatisfaction with Congress leadership's unavailability for meetings. At BJP headquarters, he made pointed remarks about the Congress leadership.In Chhatarpur, the contest between Gurjar leaders saw Kartar Singh Tanwar, who moved from AAP to BJP, triumph over former BJP member Brahm Singh Tanwar, now with AAP, by 6,239 votes.anwar, who was elected on an AAP ticket from the Chhatarpur constituency in the 2020 Assembly elections, quit the party and joined the BJP in July this year along with another MLA Raaj Kumar Anand.Former AAP minister Kailash Gahlot maintained a lead exceeding 9,000 votes in Bijwasan, competing against AAP's Surender Bhardwaj and Congress' Col Devinder Kumar Sehrawat, a former AAP representative. Kailash Gahlot , who previously held a senior position in AAP and served as a cabinet minister, stepped down from the party in November 2024. He subsequently aligned with BJP the next day. He is now standing for election from Bijwasan, having moved from his earlier constituency of Najafgarh. His electoral rivals are Surender Bharadwaj of AAP, who earlier belonged to the Samajwadi Party, and Dharmpal Chandela representing Congress.In Rajouri Garden, former Akali Dal member Manjinder Singh Sirsa, now with BJP, secured victory by over 18,000 votes. Former BJP MLA Jitender Singh Shunty's move to AAP proved unsuccessful in Shahdara against BJP's Sanjay Goyal. In Mangolpuri, former Congress minister Rajkumar Chauhan, representing BJP, won by more than 6,000 votes.AAP's Pravesh Ratan won against BJP candidate Raaj Kumar Anand with 4,049 vote margin.In April 2024, Anand stepped down from both AAP and his position in the Delhi Cabinet, expressing concerns over insufficient Dalit representation in the party. Subsequently, he switched allegiance to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in July 2024 and stood as a candidate in the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections, representing the New Delhi constituency.","Former delhi congress chief arvinder singh lovely secured victory with a 12,748-vote margin against aap's naveen chaudhary.

Early exit vindication: Former AAP comrades attribute Delhi defeat to departure from foundational values,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/early-exit-vindication-former-aap-comrades-attribute-delhi-defeat-to-departure-from-foundational-values/articleshow/118071679.cms,"Yogendra Yadav, Kumar Vishwas, Shazia Ilmi

The Aam Aadmi Party 's former members—including founding members who gradually left the party in the years following its formation—are now reacting to its historic defeat, blaming the shift in the party's original values for the downfall.What's common in their criticism is the party’s shift from the original promise of alternative politics letting down those who supported the 2011 anti-corruption movement against the then Congress-led government. Anna Hazare , regarded as the father of the anti-graft movement and the leader in whose shadow Kejriwal emerged, distanced himself from the Aam Aadmi Party as soon as it was established, citing differences in values.Hazare, while speaking to reporters in his village of Ralegan Siddhi, said that the liquor policy and the resulting influx of money had overwhelmed the party.""People saw him (Arvind Kejriwal) talking about a clean character and then about liquor,"" he told reporters in Ralegan Siddhi.Hazare further said that AAP had failed to understand the need for selfless service and had taken the wrong path. ""Money took centre stage, denting AAP's image and leading to its defeat,"" he added.""I have been saying this since the beginning: when one contests elections, the candidate's character should be clean and spotless. The candidate should understand the virtues of sacrifice and have the capacity to tolerate insults,"" he said, adding that when allegations arise, it is necessary to assure the people that these charges are unfounded. Yogendra Yadav , co-founder of the Swaraj India party and former AAP member—who was expelled in 2015 along with Prashant Bhushan—described the party’s loss as a major setback for everyone who once believed in alternative politics. He further said that AAP abandoned its core ideology soon after coming to power and instead focused solely on welfare schemes, which eventually reached a saturation point with the voters.Poet-politician Kumar Vishwas , who was actively involved in the India Against Corruption movement and one of AAP’s founding members, accused Kejriwal of “destroying” the aspirations of thousands who longed for a corruption-free country.""It is sad because 13 years ago, a wave of political renaissance swept across India, planting the seeds of alternative politics."" In a strong rebuke, he described Kejriwal as ""a shameless, narcissistic, insecure person"" who played the part of Duryodhan, leading to the downfall.""This is their first defeat. For the crime of murdering the dreams of crores of innocent people, they will be punished,"" he warned while urging AAP workers to consider their future as there appears to be little chance of the party recovering.Former Delhi Commission for Women chief and Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal , who left AAP last year after an incident at Kejriwal’s residence, remarked that the party was punished by the people for its arrogance.""Nobody’s arrogance lasts forever. What happened in Delhi today is proof,"" Maliwal told PTI.She further said that Delhi had turned into a ""garbage bin"" with issues such as water scarcity, a polluted Yamuna, and high levels of air pollution, which had led to widespread public anger.""Over the last 10 years, they showed people dreams but could not fulfill them. They got me beaten up and slandered; today people taught him a lesson, and he could not save his own seat,"" she added.Shazia Ilmi, another founding member who left AAP in 2014 for the BJP, recalled that those who had gathered at the Ramlila ground for the anti-corruption movement had envisioned a new form of politics.""I am absolutely delighted and also emotional. All of us who gathered at the Ramlila ground wanted a new kind of politics. But what did Delhi get? It got a charlatan who brought the city down,"" she said.Criticising Kejriwal further, she said, ""This is a man who caused a loss of Rs 260 crore to the exchequer, lived in 'Sheesh Mahal', and turned AAP into a disaster. Finally, Delhi will see some peace, work, and development.""The 2025 Delhi assembly elections saw a significant shift in voter preferences, leading to a historic victory for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and ending their 27-year exile from power. The BJP improved its vote share by 7.3 percentage points to secure 45.8 percent of votes, while the AAP saw its share dip by nearly 10 percentage points to 43.8 percent.",Anna hazare said that the liquor policy and the resulting influx of money had overwhelmed the party. Kumar vishwas accused kejriwal of “destroying” the aspirations of thousands who longed for a corruption-free country. Former delhi commission for women chief and rajya sabha mp swati maliwal remarked that the party was punished by the people for its arrogance.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118071235,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-60530,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Delhi poll results deepen INDIA bloc rift as Congress blamed for AAP’s defeat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-poll-results-deepen-india-bloc-rift-as-congress-blamed-for-aaps-defeat/articleshow/118071320.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi poll results are likely to reignite the debate within the opposition INDIA bloc of parties over its leadership, with Congress, the largest party and the hence the de facto leader in the bloc having played a perfect spoiler in AAP’s defeat to the BJP, which returned to office in Delhi after 27 long years.While parties like SP, RJD and Shiv Sena (UBT) had backed Trinamool Congress chief and West Bengal Mamata Banerjee to lead the bloc, DMK and NCP(SP) have not come out in support of the idea, so far.The rumblings on this line had surfaced after the Congress’s defeat in Haryana and in Maharashtra where it was in alliance with NCP (SP) and Sena (UBT). The Left parties, strongly opponents of the ruling TMC in Bengal, are unlikely to accept Banerjee’s leadership in the bloc.Whether the leadership comes at this juncture in the INDIA bloc right now or not Congress will certainly face the heat, from the INDIA allies as many accuse it of failing to take along all partners and conduct the opposition camp in a focussed direction. TMC, has been among the first ones to highlight this issue openly, since the 2024 Lok Sabha polls .With the Budget session of Parliament in session, it is to be seen whether the disruption within the INDIA bloc spills out in the House, since a joint strategy on the floor of the House has been more or less effective against the Narendra Modi-led government.Whether the defeat compels AAP to remain with the INDIA bloc or pushes it out for not getting along with Congress is also to be seen. INDIA bloc parties like SP and TMC though not having stakes in Delhi, had thrown their weight behind AAP on the grounds that it was in the best position to take on BJP.Expressing his concern over AAP’s loss, CPI general secretary D Raja said in a post on ‘X’: “BJP’s victory… serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of disunity among secular-democratic forces. This result clearly highlights that the RSS-BJP’s divisive agenda can only be effectively countered through a united, ideological and political front.” Raja added, “It is a wake-up call for the constituents of the INDIA bloc, particularly Congress—the largest party in the coalition—and other dominant regional parties.”Expressing strong disappointment, CPM and the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) said the differences in the INDIA bloc paved the way for the saffron party's good show in the national capital. The Marxist party vehemently attacked Congress and accused them of facilitating the victory of the BJP in Delhi.",The delhi poll results are likely to reignite the debate within the opposition india bloc of parties over its leadership.

Delhi polls 2025: How good governance trumped freebies in assembly elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-polls-2025-how-good-governance-trumped-freebies-in-assembly-elections/articleshow/118070246.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi on Saturday joined a growing list of states where the lotus has managed to bloom with a vengeance. The Bharatiya Janata Party, which was struggling to even get double-digits in seat share in the past two assembly polls, won the election by securing a whopping 48 of 70 seats. Breaking the 27-year jinx, the BJP is again coming back to form the government in the national capital with the promise of development and good governance.The Aam Aadmi Party's defeat this time around has shown that freebie politics cannot hold its sheen for long if not coupled with on-the-ground development and infrastructure improvement.In this year's assembly election, BJP and Congress both followed the AAP's manifestos giving free electricity, water and bus services for women and even financial aid. This seemed like a freebies vs freebies contest where the BJP's advantage stemmed from two factors: voters' assessment of implementation records, with the BJP's performance in Madhya Pradesh outweighing AAP's shortcomings in Punjab; and the understanding that welfare schemes must be complemented by good governance.Reiterating the BJP's strategy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the party's historic win in Delhi, stating that ""development and good governance"" had won.""Jana Shakti is paramount! Development wins, good governance triumphs. I bow to my dear sisters and brothers of Delhi for this resounding and historic mandate to @BJP4India. We are humbled and honoured to receive these blessings. It is our guarantee that we will leave no stone unturned in developing Delhi, improving the overall quality of life for the people and ensuring that Delhi has a prime role to play in building a Viksit Bharat,"" he said in a tweet.Freebies, though a good strategy in the short term, failed to get votes for AAP this time. There was a lack of infrastructural development that raised questions among voters regarding AAP and its effectiveness in governance. In Delhi, AAP had promised to give clean tap water but there were many areas where the people didn't even have access to tap water. Long queues behind water tankers were a common sight across the city.For this year's elections, Kejriwal also promised to give financial support to priests, sparking a debate over whether the party's ideology revovled merely around ""revdi"" politics.In the last two elections, the AAP's main strong point was Mohalla clinics and municipal schools but one cannot fight only on the basis of these two pillars. Delhiites were looking for more evidence of developmental works that AAP had done in the last decade, and the party came up short.Another factor that lent itself to AAP's defeat was its frequent run-ins with the Lt Governor's office. Considering Delhi's governance structure under the National Capital Territory Act, the constant bickering created an impression of administrative inefficiency by AAP.Kejriwal's decision to retain his CM position whilst in custody over the excise policy scam case appeared to convince voters that administrative efficiency was being compromised for political advantage.This also resulted in postponed Cabinet sessions and administrative standstill. Saturday's results suggest that stepping down in March 2024 and maintaining ethical standards would have been a more prudent political strategy.",The bharatiya janata party won the election by securing a whopping 48 of 70 seats. The bjp is again coming back to form the government in the national capital.

In Delhi, where Congress ruled for 15 years a decade ago, it has not won a single seat in the 6 elections held since 2014,"" Shah said.""In this assembly election, Congress’s security deposit was forfeited in 67 out of 70 seats. If there is any stability found for Congress under Rahul Gandhi ’s leadership, it is found in zero (0). This reflects the situation of Congress, which is dedicated to serving one family, across the country,"" he added.Shah's reactions came hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi attacked Congress, saying the country needs a serious political transformation and not politics of ""dhoort-ta (deceit) and moorkhta (foolishness)"".He said people of Delhi have short-circuited the politics of short-cuts and asserted that the mandate has made it clear that there's no space for corruption and lies in politics.Meanwhile, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi accepted the results of Delhi assembly elections and thanked the party workers and supporters.In a social media post on X, Rahul said that the party will continue to fight against pollution, inflation, and corruption in the capital.""We humbly accept the mandate of Delhi. A heartfelt thanks to all the Congress workers for their dedication and to all the voters for their support,"" Rahul said.""The fight against pollution, inflation, and corruption, as well as for the progress of Delhi and the rights of its citizens, will continue,"" he added.The Congress has yet again failed to open its account in the Delhi assembly - earning the dubious distinction of scoring a hat trick of zeros. The grand-old-party, which ruled Delhi for 15 years on the trot from 1998 to 2013, has been rejected by the people of Delhi now in three consecutive assembly elections.The BJP won 48 of the 70 seats at stake and the AAP was way behind with 22, according to the Election Commission website. The elections were largely seen as a bipolar contest between the AAP, which made a determined bid for a fourth term, and the BJP. While the AAP had 62 members in the outgoing house, the saffron party had just eight legislators.","Amit shah takes a potshot at the grand-old-party in a social media post.

Delhi election results 2025: As the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) looks set to form government in Delhi, one question that people are asking is - can Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma become the Chief Minister of Delhi, even if he loses the New Delhi assembly constituency seat against former CM Arvind Kejriwal?BJP’s Parvesh Verma is locked in a very tight battle against AAP’s Arvind Kejriwal in the New Delhi assembly constituency.The leading and trailing candidates are changing with every round of counting. In such a situation, what will happen if Kejriwal defeats Parvesh Verma? Can the latter still hope to become Delhi’s chief minister?Unlike other states, Delhi does not have the concept of Member of Legislative Council, which is the route Uddhav Thackeray took to become the chief minister of Maharashtra. In other states, if an individual loses the assembly election and is chosen to the chief minister by the winning party, the legislative council route is taken for appointment.Also Read | New Delhi election results 2025: It's Arvind Kejriwal vs Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma vs Sandeep Dikshit So what happens in Delhi? If BJP forms the government and chooses Parvesh Verma to be the chief minister, then Parvesh Verma will have to win a Delhi assembly seat in 6 months time. Usually in such cases, the winning party asks one of its MLAs to vacate a relatively ‘safer’ seat for the chief minister, and then bypolls are held.Originating from an influential political family in Delhi, Parvesh Verma is the son of former BJP leader and Delhi chief minister Sahib Singh Verma. His uncle, Azad Singh, previously held the position of North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor and contested from Mundka constituency as a BJP candidate in the 2013 assembly elections.His political journey began in 2013 when he emerged victorious in the Delhi Legislative Assembly elections from the Mehrauli constituency.Subsequently, he clinched the West Delhi parliamentary seat in 2014 and secured a remarkable re-election in 2019, winning by a substantial margin of 5.78 lakh votes.Ahead of the 2025 Delhi elections, Parvesh Verma launched a campaign titled ""Remove Kejriwal, Save the Nation"", highlighting the alleged failures of the current AAP government in delivering their core promises.During his campaign, Verma sharply criticised the Delhi government's administrative capabilities, particularly their approach towards pollution management, women's safety, and urban infrastructure development. He emphasised their unfulfilled promise regarding the cleaning of the Yamuna River, which continues to pose a significant environmental issue for Delhi.","Bjp's parvesh verma is locked in a very tight battle against aap’s arvind kejriwal.

NEW DELHI: Riding on the wave of recent successes in Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections just a few months ago, the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) registered a big win in the Delhi assembly elections. Arvind Kejriwal 's Aam Aadmi Party suffered an embarrassing loss as most of its heavyweights lost the contest.The BJP secured a significant victory in Delhi, winning 48 seats in the 70-member assembly.AAP , which had dominated the previous two terms with a substantial majority, managed only 22 seats. The Congress party failed to secure any seats for the third straight time.The BJP and its NDA allies celebrated the Delhi win, attributing it to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership. The Congress, however, maintained that the results reflected a verdict on AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal rather than Modi's governance.The Congress defended its decision to contest against Aam Aadmi Party, criticising those who questioned their stance. They pointed out that similar concerns about opposition unity were not raised when AAP contested elections in Goa, Gujarat, Haryana and other states, potentially dividing the secular vote.The BJP, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi swept the Delhi assembly elections with a comfortable majority. This victory marks the third major electoral success for the BJP in the last four months after winning the states of Haryana and Maharashtra. With this, the 27 years exile of the BJP in Delhi also comes to an end. This major win also indicates approval by the middle class to Modi government’s big tax relief in the Union budget 2025 last week have got the approval of middle-class consumers.With this, PM Modi yet again proves to be the star campaigner for the BJP.In a high-stakes battle for New Delhi assembly seat, BJP leader Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant slayer by defeating former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal by 4,089 seats.Son of former CM Sahib Singh Verma, Parvesh was was entrusted to take on Kejriwal who has held in to the seat last three times. In 2013, Kejriwal had emerged as giant slayer by defeating then CM and Congress veteran Sheila Dixit.After dethroning the three-time CM, Verma is also in now a strong contender for the top post.BJP leader Tarvinder Singh Marwah emerged as another giant slayer as he defeated former deputy CM and AAP senior leader Manish Sisodia. Marwah defeated three-time MLA Sisodia to win Jangpura seat by 675 votes. Sisodia had switched seats from Patparganj to Jangpura this time hoping for a comfortable win.Marwah, who was in Congress for a long time and elected three-time MLA from Jangpura, had switched to BJP in 2022 after complaining of not getting time with Sonia and Rahul Gandhi for a meeting.Also read: Delhi election results: How the OGs of AAP became Kejriwal’s biggest critics over the decade As the heavyweights of Aam Aadmi Party fell one by one, Atishi stood tall and won the Kalkaji assembly seat. In a high-stakes contest, Atishi won by 3,521 votes defeating BJP's Ramesh Bidhuri and Congress's Alka Lamba.""I thank the people of Kalkaji for showing trust in me. I congratulate my team who worked against 'baahubal',"" Atishi said.""We accept the people's mandate. I have won but it's not a time to celebrate but continue the 'war' against the BJP,"" the 43-year-old said.Her victory is a standout for the AAP as its top leaders Arvind Kejriwal and former Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia lost their constituencies.With the defeat served to Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia, Atishi may now also take charge as the leader of opposition in Delhi assembly.The Congress leader may have lost the contest today but he surely has emerged as the 'Baazigar' of this poll season. Son of veteran Congress leader and three-time CM Sheila Dikshit, Sandeep got his ultimate revenge against Arvind Kejriwal today.Though he did not win the New Delhi seat, he managed to eat in to Kejriwal's votes that eventually led to the AAP chief's defeat.It was a matter of prestige for Sandeep, who was finally given a ticket from New Delhi, his mother's bastion, which had been the stronghold of Kejriwal since 2013.It's no surprise there. The one at the top of this list is AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal. The politician, who rose to power as a anti-graft crusader found himself embroiled in corruption cases.After walking out of jail on bail, Kejriwal resigned from the top post seeking validation from the public of Delhi. The union territory, however, refused to give the stamp of 'Mr Clean' to Kejriwal.The AAP suffered a major blow this election and now will have to look at ways to reinvent itself.The former deputy chief minister of Delhi and second-in-command of AAP, Sisodia, also faced defeat against BJP candidate Tarvinder Singh Marwah in the Jangpura constituency.Having previously served as a three-term MLA from Patparganj in east Delhi, he chose to contest from Jangpura in this election.Following his arrest in 2023 over alleged corruption in the liquor policy case, Sisodia was imprisoned for approximately 18 months until he secured bail. Similar to Kejriwal's stance, he declined to accept a governmental position prior to receiving the ""people's verdict"".Delhi, however, decided to give him another chance this time.After governing Delhi for a decade, AAP faced significant anti-incumbency and lost the election to BJP. This is the first time since its inception that AAP will not hold power in Delhi.With the Delhi loss, AAP is now in power only in Punjab. With this, the national expansion plan of the party has hit a roadblock.The party will now have to regroup and reorganise itself as it now sits in opposition in Delhi.The Congress party has recorded its third consecutive blank in the Delhi assembly elections, marking a stark contrast to its earlier dominance when it governed the capital for 15 consecutive years from 1998 to 2013.Delhi's electorate has consistently rejected the party in three successive assembly elections.After snapping alliance with AAP for Delhi elections , Congress mounted an assertive campaign with former party president Rahul Gandhi spearheading the criticism against Arvind Kejriwal.Despite these efforts, the party failed to secure any constituencies in Delhi. Their sole minor comfort lies in achieving a modest improvement in vote share, rising by approximately 2% from its previous figure of less than 5% in the 2020 assembly elections.Omar Abdullah’s X post captured the mood of INDIA bloc today -- 'Aur lado aapas mein'. The jibe came as AAP and Congress fought against each other which eventually benefitted BJP.With the bitter and ugly fight and AAP’s eventual loss in Delhi, the focus now turns to if it's an end to INDIA bloc.The AAP defeat also comes as an embarassment to Trinamool Congress and Samajwadi Party who actively campaigned for AAP in Delhi.While Congress may have not been able to open its account in Delhi once again, Rahul Gandhi cannot be put in the list of losers. Rahul, who personally took charge to dent Kejriwal's image during the election campaign, was successful in his mission.The defeat also limits AAP within the INDIA bloc who had the capability to challenge Congress' position as a national party. The Delhi blow also gives Congress a little immunity within the bloc where allies SP, TMC, Sena (UBT) chose Kejriwal's party over Congress.","The bjp secured a significant victory in delhi, winning 48 seats in the 70-member assembly. Aam aadmi party suffered an embarrassing loss as most of its heavyweights lost the contest. The congress party failed to secure any seats for the third straight time.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118066812,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1558501,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Arvind Kejriwal 's dream run in Delhi has come to an end. After two sweeping victories - in 2015 and 2020 - Kejriwal's AAP has been swept out of power in the 2025 assembly elections. The BJP has finally managed to breach Kejriwal's Delhi fortress to regain power after a gap of 27 years. The former Delhi chief minister, who was out on bail in the excise policy case, ran a very aggressive campaign against the BJP and also targeted the Congress.So, why did Kejriwal lose? Here's a look at some of the tricks that failed to click for the AAP chief.Arvind Kejriwal, who was out on bail in the excise policy case, resigned as chief minister of Delhi in September 2024, months ahead of elections to take a high moral ground on the issue of corruption.""I am ready for Agni Pariksha. Two days later, I will resign as chief minister. I will not sit on that chair till the people announce their verdict,"" Kejriwal had said at the time of resignation.Kejriwal, who had refused to resign even when he was in jail, eventually gave up his chair amid turmoil faced by him in the Delhi excise policy case. Several top leaders, including Kejriwal himself, faced accusations of accepting bribes from liquor companies in exchange for favorable policies. Eventually, several AAP leaders were jailed in connection with the case.Kejriwal's claim to fame in his first two terms was his transparent and pro-people governance model. The AAP chief claimed credit for transforming Delhi's government schools and his Mohalla clinics provided cheap medicare to the poor. In the 2020 elections, Kejriwal sought votes for his work and AAP campaign centred around the change it had brought to the lives of the people. However, this time around AAP's campaign was centred around its attacks on the BJP leadership and the Congress. Kejriwal, who along with top AAP leadership faced several corruption charges, focused less on development and governance narratives. He called BJP ""Gali Galauj Party.""In the middle of the campaign, Kejriwal dropped a bombshell as he accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna waters to kill people of Delhi. Kejriwal's charges gave a toxic turn to Delhi campaign with both BJP and Congress going all out against the AAP chief. At the end, as the results show - the people of Delhi were not swayed by his ""concerns"" for them.Arvind Kejriwal tried to woo the middle class by unveiling his party’s manifesto for them. He claimed that the middle class were ignored by successive governments and accused other political parties of treating them as ""just an ATM for the government"". Ironically though, Kejriwal's manifesto did not mention what he would do for the middle class if voted to power but only listed seven demands from the Centre to improve their lives. Little wonder, at the end the Centre's sops for the middle class in the Uunion Budget appealed more to Delhi voters than the AAP's demands.Confrontation has been a part of Kejriwal's politics right from the beginning. This time around it was no different. Right through his campaign, Kejriwal trained his guns at Delhi Police and the Election Commission. Kejriwal accused the Election Commission and Delhi Police of colluding with the BJP to subvert the electoral process and prevent AAP from campaigning. Kejriwal targeted Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar and alleged that he ""wants a job post-retirement"" and was ""destroying the country"" for the post. Kejriwal's decision to take on the Congress along with the BJP boomeranged as on several seats, AAP's margin of defeat is less than the votes polled by the Congress candidate. Both Kejriwal and Rahul made relentless attacks against each other giving an opportunity to mock the allies-turned-rivals and take digs at opposition unity.",Kejriwal's dream run in delhi has come to an end. After two sweeping victories - in 2015 and 2020 - kejriwal's aap has been swept out of power in the 2025 assembly elections.

NEW DELHI: Delhi has given its verdict and its 'ghar wapsi' for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after 27 years. According to the Election Commission, the BJP has 47 of a total of 70 seats in its bag. Arvind Kejriwal's AAP, which has ruled the union territory for a decade, managed to get only 23 seats.This marks the third major win for the BJP in the last four months after Haryana and Maharashtra assembly elections.The Aam Aadmi Party, established in 2012, secured governance in Delhi in 2013 and had maintained its administrative control since 2015.The Kejriwal/Atishi government, however, failed to fight anti-incumbency. AAP's recognition of public dissatisfaction was evident in its selection of candidates.Despite making eleventh-hour alterations to the list, these changes proved insufficient to address the negative perception of certain MLAs, who were criticised for being unreachable and distant from their constituents.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Union budget gambit seems to have paid off as Delhi decided to give BJP a chance after 27 years. With a focus on the middle class, the Union finance minister announced a big tax relief to middle class just three days before the Delhi elections.Kejriwal's AAP had emerged from middle-class dissatisfaction with existing political systems but is now largely perceived as an organisation focused solely on underprivileged sections, offering benefits like complimentary electricity units and free transport for women.Also read: Winners and Losers of Delhi assembly election 2025 Although Kejriwal attempted to address middle class issues during his pre-election addresses, these efforts appeared insufficient and delayed.Since 2013, Kejriwal's AAP government has been able to establish 'Delhi model' in which it implemented several freebies/welfare schemes for the underprivileged. The BJP, however, did an Uno reverse on AAP in Delhi and announced several freebies and incentives.The BJP leadership, including PM Modi, while previously criticising welfare programmes as 'revadis', took a notably different stance in Delhi. They explicitly assured voters that all existing AAP government schemes would continue under BJP rule. The PM's personal guarantee on this matter carried significant authority and effectively countered AAP's assertions that BJP governance would deprive the underprivileged of their current benefits.The party, in its three-part manifesto, promised financial assistance of Rs 2,500 monthly to women from poor families under 'Mahila Samriddhi Yojana', LPG cylinders for Rs 500 to women from poor families, and one free cylinder each on Holi and Diwali.After years of blame-game by the Kejriwal government, it seems people of Delhi have had enough. This time, Delhi decided to go for a ""double-engine sarkaar"", which promises effective governance with the BJP government in the state and at the Centre.Also read: Delhi election results: How the OGs of AAP became Kejriwal’s biggest critics over the decade During the elections led by PM Modi, the BJP went all out to attack Kejriwal for non-governance in the last decade. Kejriwal, on the other hand, had time and again blamed the Centre and the LG for creating hurdles. The AAP also attributed the deteriorating road conditions and inadequate civic infrastructure to project delays caused by the LG.The voters appear to have concluded that a BJP-led government would operate more effectively with the Centre-appointed LG.A big credit for the BJP's win in Delhi could also be given to Rahul Gandhi. The Congress leader took upon himself to personally roast and attack Kejriwal.During the campaign, he singled out Kejriwal and even equated him with PM Modi, alleging that they were two sides of the same coin. Taking a direct jab at the AAP supremo, Rahul had said, “Arvind Kejriwal WagonR mein aaye, sweater pehne aur khambe pe chadh gaye. Phir khambe se utre aur seedha sheesh Mahal mein gaye (Arvind Kejriwal came in a small car—a WagonR—wearing a sweater and climbed an electric pole. After coming down, he went straight to the 'Sheesh Mahal' (glass palace) with automatic doors and big TVs)"".The AAP had secured governance by pledging to eliminate corruption in Delhi. The party's reputation, however, faced significant challenges due to the liquor policy controversy and various corruption allegations against its leadership.Prominent AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh have been at the centre of corruption charges.After getting out on bail, Kejriwal resigned from the CM post and gave the charge to Atishi. He had sought validation as 'Mr. Clean' from the voters. Delhi, however, decided to not give him another chance.In 2020, reducing Delhi air pollution was one of the 10 “guarantees of Kejriwal”. However, this year, “Kejriwal’s guarantee” did not mention pollution anywhere. In the last 10 years, the AAP government has pointed fingers at neighbouring states and refused to take responsibility for air pollution.The BJP, however, vowed to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 levels by half in the next five years.Targetting Kejriwal, BJP also promised to clean Yamuna water in the next five years.Prime Minister Narendra Modi once again proved to be the star campaigner for the BJP. Despite having no CM face in Delhi, BJP registers yet another win in assembly elections riding on PM Modi's popularity. During the election campaign, PM Modi personally took charge of targeting Arvind Kejriwal.True to his style, PM Modi started calling Kejriwal's party an 'AAPda' (disaster) for Delhi. He also took 'Farziwal' jibes at Kejriwal accusing him of being fake and corrupt.In fact, PM Modi also focused on attacking Kejriwal during his Lok Sabha speech a day before Delhi elections.During the Delhi assembly elections, the BJP tailored its message and underplayed Hindutva this time. Focussing on the anti-incumbency of Kejriwal, BJP focussed on governance and middle class.Much of the BJP campaign targetted Kejriwal who, along with Manish Sisodia, was jailed in a corruption case relating to a now-scrapped liquor policy over the past two years. The relentless focus on Kejriwal’s ""sheesh mahal"" may have also helped the BJP sway public opinion in favour of the party.The BJP's comprehensive campaign strategy amplified the demand for transformation in Delhi, capitalising on AAP leader Kejriwal's diminishing reputation amidst corruption allegations and perceived deviation from his original principles, particularly highlighted by the 'sheesh mahal' controversy.BJP officials managing different regions in the capital noted that their extensive 2020 campaign failed to gain traction because voters associated AAP's initial five-year tenure with positive developments in education, healthcare, and popular welfare schemes including complimentary bus travel for women and free electricity.The absence of significant corruption allegations during AAP's first term contrasted sharply with the present scenario, with BJP strategists noting that the ruling party had few achievements to highlight from their second term.""Out vote share grew significantly even in 2020 but there was no serious erosion in AAP's vote share. This time we succeeded in chipping away at its support base while keeping our votes intact,"" a BJP leader said.The BJP has won Delhi elections, but it also has Congress to thank. Congress and AAP, allies under INDIA bloc, decided to contest the Delhi assembly elections individually. During the campaign, both AAP and Congress accused each other of being the B team of the BJP.Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi opened a personal attack on Kejriwal while the AAP chief also left no stone unturned to discredit Congress. Eventually, though Congress was not able to open its account in Delhi, the Gandhis definitely dealt a big blow to the credibility of Kejriwal.","The aam aadmi party, established in 2012, secured governance in delhi in 2013 and had maintained its administrative control since 2015. According to the election commission, the bjp has 47 of a total of 70 seats in its bag.

AAP’s setback and Kejriwal’s challenges



AAP’s uncertain future



A shifting political landscape



What lies ahead?



NEW DELHI: In 2013, with a pen in his pocket, a muffler around his neck, loose sweater and blue WagonR, Arvind Kejriwal embodied the ""aam aadmi"" when he entered public life. His decision to name his political party after the ""aam aadmi"" resonated strongly with the public.After twelve years, the aspirations of establishing a nationwide party and emerging as a national leader are diminishing for the civil servant-turned-activist who ventured into politics by establishing his own party rather than joining an existing one.The Aam Aadmi Party , which governed Delhi for 10 consecutive years and established a government in Punjab, suffered defeat in the capital city's election on Saturday, securing 22 seats whilst the BJP won 48.In his statement, Kejriwal assured that AAP members would continue their social work, emphasising that politics was only a means to serve the people. However, his political future remains uncertain.Kejriwal’s loss after a decade in power, coupled with the defeat of several AAP heavyweights, raises crucial questions about the party’s governance, strategy, and long-term vision. The AAP, which once held a brute majority in the Delhi assembly, now faces an existential crisis, struggling to maintain its relevance.Adding to Kejriwal’s woes are multiple legal battles. He was jailed on corruption charges related to the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy and is currently out on bail. With ongoing investigations by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Kejriwal’s legal troubles are far from over. If convicted in the money laundering case, he could face a minimum of seven years in prison.Moreover, the Haryana government has filed a case against Kejriwal under the Disaster Management Act over his statement about ""poison"" in Yamuna water from Haryana. These legal entanglements make his political comeback even more challenging.Following the Delhi loss, AAP’s influence has been significantly curtailed. The party remains in power only in Punjab, and its expansion efforts in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Goa have yielded little success. With the party now leaderless in the Delhi assembly and its national ambitions derailed, AAP is at a crossroads.For Kejriwal, the road ahead may require a return to his roots—street-style activism, which first propelled him to prominence during the Anna Hazare movement. However, his biggest challenge will be keeping his party intact. AAP, once a force driven by volunteers and grassroots support, now risks fragmentation in the absence of political power.Nationally, Congress may see AAP’s weakening as an opportunity to reclaim lost ground in Delhi and beyond. Kejriwal’s diminished political standing could also make him a less favored ally among opposition parties, further isolating him in national politics.Speculation is already rife about Kejriwal potentially shifting focus to Punjab, where AAP still holds power. However, such a move could trigger further instability within the party and raise questions about its leadership structure.Kejriwal’s immediate focus will likely be on his legal battles. His political fate hinges on whether he can clear his name and rebuild his credibility. Meanwhile, AAP must reassess its strategies and find a way to stay relevant in the evolving political landscape.For now, both Kejriwal and AAP face their most challenging phase yet—navigating a period of political uncertainty, internal churn, and legal hurdles that could define their future trajectory.","The aam aadmi party, which governed delhi for 10 consecutive years, suffered defeat in the capital city's election on saturday.

First Congress lost allies, then votes



Had the outcome been different if INDIA bloc contested together?



NEW DELHI: In the bustling newsrooms, as vote counting began for the Delhi elections, two names dominated the airwaves: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Conspicuously absent from the conversation was the Congress party – once the dominant force in Delhi's political landscape. As the day went by, the only thing that remained constant was the grand old party's score on the scoreboard - zero.The Congress party, which ruled Delhi for 15 years on the trot from 1998 to 2013, went through a fourth consecutive defeat, ""humbly"" accepting the mandate as it had no other choice.""We humbly accept the mandate of Delhi. Heartfelt thanks to all Congress workers for their dedication and to all voters for their support. The fight for Delhi’s progress and the rights of Delhiites—against pollution, inflation, and corruption—will continue,"" the party leader Rahul Gandhi said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his victory speech said that the Congress ""drowns and takes down its allies with it"".Political analysts have often wondered if it's the Congress that's the weak link in INDIA bloc or is it the only pan India uniting force.When outcomes are analysed, INDIA bloc has lost crucial battles since it came into existence- Lok Sabha elections and Maharashtra. However, on the other side, it did secure victory in the politically crucial poll battle of Jammu and Kashmir- but the Congress could only manage six seats, leaving the National Conference as the largest party.Likewise, the opposition bloc swept the Jharkhand polls with Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leading the way with 34 seats. Congress could win only 16.What's noticeable here is that the INDIA bloc has always won where the regional parties have taken the steering wheel.States where the opposition bloc did not contest together- Haryana & Delhi- did end up becoming each other's vote cutters, paving a smooth way for the BJP.The story of Congress's downfall in this election began well before the first vote was cast. The fractures within the INDIA bloc, a coalition of opposition parties, became apparent when heavyweight leaders like Mamata Banerjee and Akhilesh Yadav chose to back AAP's Arvind Kejriwal instead of their supposed ally, Congress.""It feels like the BJP government will be formed,"" admitted Congress candidate Sandeep Dikshit from the New Delhi constituency, his words reflecting the party's diminishing expectations. The exit polls had already predicted this outcome, with most projections pointing to a clear BJP victory.Rahul Gandhi during the poll campaigns led a fierce attack on AAP, targeting Kejriwal over corruption allegations, while Kejriwal hit back, raising the National Herald case against Rahul.Jammu and Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah criticized INDIA bloc allies AAP and Congress for contesting as rivals in the Delhi elections, as trends indicated significant gains for the BJP.""Aur lado aapas mein (fight more), "" Omar said reacting to trends.The results raised an inevitable question: Could the outcome have been different if the INDIA bloc had maintained unity? Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut seemed to think so, suggesting that a combined opposition could have secured victory against the BJP within the first hour of counting.""The early trends show a sharp competition. Had Congress and AAP been together, the results may have been different. The political opponent of AAP and Congress is BJP. Both of them fought to keep BJP from coming to power, but they fought individually. If they had been together then BJP's defeat must have been confirmed in the first hour (of counting),"" Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut said.The division of opposition votes, a phenomenon also witnessed in the Haryana assembly elections, appeared to play directly into the BJP's hands. The very alliance that was formed to unite the opposition against the BJP ended up exemplifying its disunity.As Delhi's political landscape continues to evolve, the Congress party struggles to stay relevant. The party that once commanded the capital's political narrative now finds itself searching for relevance in a city it once called its own.","The congress party, which ruled delhi for 15 years on the trot from 1998 to 2013, went through a fourth consecutive defeat.

NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party 's (AAP) loss in the Delhi assembly elections has sparked speculation about its political clout in Punjab, with opposition leaders in the state predicting a similar downfall.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured a decisive victory in Delhi, reclaiming power after 26 years and dealing a severe blow to Arvind Kejriwal 's AAP, whose senior leadership struggled to hold ground.This marks the second major setback for AAP following the 2024 Lok Sabha elections , in which the party secured only three of the 13 parliamentary seats in Punjab.In contrast, AAP had secured a sweeping victory in the 2022 Punjab assembly elections, winning 92 out of 117 seats.Before the Delhi polls, Punjab's AAP unit, including chief minister Bhagwant Mann , cabinet ministers, MPs, and MLAs, actively campaigned in the national capital.Mann, as the party’s key campaigner, conducted roadshows and highlighted the achievements of his government, such as providing 50,000 government jobs, offering 300 units of free electricity, setting up 850 'mohalla clinics,' and acquiring a private thermal power plant.With AAP now governing only Punjab, opposition parties in the state strongly criticised the party, asserting that the Delhi electorate has exposed its ""lies and deceit"".""It is a defeat of Arvind Kejriwal's lies, deceit and dishonesty. People of Delhi today showed that you cannot rule the state for long by making false promises,"" Punjab BJP general secretary Subhash Sharma told news agency PTI.He further claimed that AAP's governance had left Delhi in a ""miserable"" condition and warned that Punjab’s AAP leaders would face an even worse fate.Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa predicted internal strife within AAP’s Punjab unit, claiming, ""There would be an internal power struggle between Bhagwant Mann and Arvind Kejriwal.""He blamed the Delhi defeat on corruption, inefficiency, and arrogance within AAP's leadership.BJP leader Preneet Kaur expressed satisfaction over her party's victory, adding that AAP’s much-touted ""Delhi model"" failed to deliver on its promises.""We have seen that their ""Aam Aadmi clinics"" did not work here. What they had promised, they did not keep them,"" she said.Congress MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira described the outcome as a setback for ""fake revolutionaries"" who had failed to uphold their commitments on issues like VIP culture, Lokpal, Swaraj, and corruption.Punjab BJP vice president and former MLA Arvind Khanna called the Delhi mandate a rejection of AAP’s governance model, arguing that it signalled ""the beginning of AAP's downfall in Punjab as well"".He emphasized that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, India had experienced significant progress, making it crucial for Punjab to embrace BJP for real development.Union minister Ravneet Singh Bittu echoed similar sentiments on X, posting, ""History rewritten in Delhi! After 27 years, the people have given BJP a resounding mandate, embracing PM @narendramodi's vision of Viksit Bharat. This victory is a testament to trust, development, and a brighter future. Thank you, Delhi.""He further accused AAP of harbouring ""the most corrupt leaders"" and suggested that the party’s downfall in Punjab was imminent.With AAP facing a critical juncture, its future in Punjab remains uncertain as political opponents ramp up their attacks, sensing an opportunity to weaken the party’s hold on the state.","The bharatiya janata party (bjp) secured a decisive victory in delhi, reclaiming power after 26 years.

The grand-old-party, which ruled Delhi for 15 years on the trot from 1998 to 2013, has been rejected by the people of Delhi now in three consecutive assembly elections.Congress, which snapped its ties with AAP in the assembly elections, led a very aggressive campaign in Delhi with former party chief Rahul Gandhi leading the charge against Arvind Kejriwal.However, the party failed to impress the voters of Delhi and could not win any seat. The only small consolation for the party is perhaps the nearly 2% increase in its vote share - which had gone down to under 5% in the 2020 assembly elections.The Congress's Delhi decline started in 2013, when the party lost power and was reduced to 8 seats with 11.4% vote share. The AAP gained at Congress's expense and won 28 seats with a vote share of 40%. In the 2015 assembly elections, the Congress could not win any seat and its vote share reduced to 9.7%.

Exit polls: A mixed track record for AAP



2013: Exit polls predicted 17 seats for AAP; the party won 28.

2015: Most polls forecast 45 seats for AAP; the party swept 67 seats.

2020: The average prediction for AAP was 52, but it secured 62.

Exit polls vs actual results: A history of misfires





Lok Sabha Elections 2024: Exit polls had predicted a BJP-led NDA landslide, with some even forecasting '400-paar.' However, the actual results fell significantly short.

Contrary to predictions, Congress and its allies won 216 seats.

NEW DELHI: Exit polls have frequently missed the mark in recent elections. In the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, they overestimated the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) performance, while in the Haryana assembly election, they incorrectly projected a tilt towards Congress. Predictions also varied widely across states. However, in the Delhi assembly election, exit polls were notably accurate, closely aligning with the actual results.On the counting day, the BJP secured 48 seats, while the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) won 22 seats displaying its worst performance since 2013.While most exit polls correctly predicted a BJP victory, their estimates for AAP varied significantly.Exit polls broadly captured BJP's lead, though many overestimated AAP's tally, reflecting the inconsistencies that have plagued past election predictions.Based on the Delhi election results (BJP: 48, AAP: 22, Congress: 0), P-Marq emerged as the most accurate, predicting AAP at 26 and BJP at 44, with a deviation of just four seats for both parties. Poll Diary followed closely, precisely forecasting AAP’s 22 seats and coming within two seats for BJP, though it slightly overestimated Congress.Axis My India also performed well, underestimating AAP by just two seats and missing BJP’s tally by the same margin, making it one of the more reliable projections for the BJP.Chanakya Strategies and People’s Insight had a six-seat deviation for BJP and a five-seat deviation for AAP, making them relatively accurate but not the best. Similarly, JVC Poll showed a comparable margin of error.Further down the accuracy rankings, MATRIZE significantly overestimated AAP’s strength (35 seats, 13 more than actual) while underestimating BJP’s performance (38 seats, 10 fewer than actual). DV Research followed a similar pattern, overestimating AAP by eight seats and underestimating BJP by the same number.The Poll of Polls compilation had a four-seat error for AAP and a five-seat error for BJP, placing it in the middle of the accuracy rankings. Peoples Pulse-Codema was significantly off, underestimating AAP by seven seats and overestimating BJP by eight seats. However, WEPRESIDE was the least accurate of all, overestimating AAP by a massive 27 seats while underestimating BJP by the same margin, making it the most incorrect prediction overall.Also read: Delhi election results: How the OGs of AAP became Kejriwal’s biggest critics over the decade AAP leaders dismissed the projections before the results were announced, citing historical inaccuracies. Party spokesperson Reena Gupta pointed out that in 2013, 2015, and 2020, exit polls had consistently underestimated AAP’s performance.

NEW DELHI: 'Aur lado aapas mein' - J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah's tweet on Saturday said it all as the BJP ended the decade-long rule of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi. The decision of AAP and Congress, who were allies during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, to turn rivals in assembly elections may have played a big role in BJP's victory.Former chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal, chose to contest independently, shutting down any possibility of an alliance with Congress even before the election dates were announced.According to the Election Commission of India (ECI), the BJP is set to form the government in Delhi after 27 years, with 47 seats, while AAP could secure only 23 seats. Congress, on the other hand, failed to open its account for the third consecutive time.The decision of AAP and Congress to go solo seems to have played a decisive role in splitting the anti-BJP vote.A closer analysis of the election data suggests that an AAP-Congress alliance could have altered the results in at least 15 seats. The combined vote share of the two parties in key constituencies like Rajinder Nagar, Chhatarpur, Sangam Vihar, Greater Kailash, and others shows that AAP could have emerged victorious had it contested with Congress’ support.With Congress failing to make an impact on its own, a partnership could have provided both parties with a stronger electoral footing.For instance, in Rajinder Nagar, AAP secured 45,440 votes while Congress got 4,015. If these votes were combined, AAP’s tally would have reached 49,455, enough to defeat the BJP. Similarly, in Chhatarpur, AAP’s 74,230 votes combined with Congress’s 6,601 would have pushed the total to 80,831, securing a win. The same pattern holds in other constituencies like Sangam Vihar, Greater Kailash, and Timarpur, where an alliance could have led to AAP’s victory.In seats like Badli and Nangloi Jat, Congress’s strong presence further underlines how a joint front could have been a game-changer. In Badli, AAP secured 35,668 votes while Congress got 31,130. Their combined tally of 66,798 would have comfortably beaten the BJP. Nangloi Jat tells a similar story, with AAP’s 48,907 votes and Congress’s 31,918 combining for a total of 80,825—enough to win the seat.Even in tight contests such as in Narela, where BJP barely edged ahead, an AAP-Congress alliance might have changed the final outcome.Beyond numbers, the election results signal a potential strategic miscalculation by AAP. While the party has governed Delhi for a decade, its recent friction with Congress over seat-sharing in other states might have influenced its decision to contest alone. The split in opposition votes ultimately benefited BJP, allowing it to regain control of Delhi after nearly three decades.",The bjp ended the decade-long rule of the aam aadmi party (aap) in delhi. The decision of aap and congress to turn rivals in assembly elections may have played a big role in bjp's victory.

AAP's heavyweights swept off

NEW DELHI: In a stunning political shift for Delhi, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) marked a historic comeback in 27 years, securing 48 out of 70 assembly seats. The ruling Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ), which had governed the capital for two consecutive terms, suffered a massive setback, managing to secure just 22 seats.What made the defeat more striking was the loss of several top AAP leaders, including former chief minister and party's national convenor Arvind Kejriwal Despite AAP’s overall poor performance, a number of relatively low-profile candidates played a crucial role in keeping the party's presence known in the Vidhan Sabha as barely any key names were able to get a win.AAP’s Atishi secured a hard-fought victory in Kalkaji, successfully defending her seat against BJP’s Ramesh Bidhuri and Congress’s Alka Lamba with a margin of 3,521 votes. She was among the few high-profile leaders in the party to retain their constituencies. Alongside her, three former Delhi government ministers—Gopal Rai (Babarpur), Mukesh Ahlawat (Sultanpur Majra), and Imran Hussain (Ballimaran)—also clinched wins. Imran Hussain registered a decisive victory in Ballimaran with a margin of 29,823 votes, while Gopal Rai secured Babarpur by 18,994 votes. Additionally, Amanatullah Khan emerged victorious in Okhla, defeating his opponents by 23,639 votes.Thus, the lesser known names became a saving grace for the party, raising a possibility of modifications in AAP's top command. Here is a list of the underdogs that won:Here’s the list without bold and bullets:Several key AAP leaders faced setbacks in the elections, including some of the party’s most prominent figures. Delhi's ex-CM Kejriwal suffered a surprising defeat in New Delhi, losing to BJP’s Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma by 4,089 votes. Former deputy CM Manish Sisodia also fell short in Jangpura, where he lost to BJP’s Tarvinder Singh Marwah by a narrow margin of 675 votes.Senior leader Saurabh Bharadwaj was defeated in Greater Kailash to BJP’s Shikha Roy by 3,188 votes. Meanwhile, ex-minister Satyendar Jain faced one of the biggest losses for AAP, losing Shakur Basti to BJP’s Karnail Singh by a significant 21,000 votes.As the Delhi elections swept away key leaders, a significant challenge now arises in determining who will emerge as the primary opposition, with the BJP's lotus blooming in the capital.With Atishi's victory, she becomes a leading contender to spearhead the opposition, but her path could be complicated. Without the backing of major figures like her predecessor Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Satyendra Jain, Atishi must navigate a party with MLAs, who until now, have lacked a strong presence in top command. This leadership gap might pose a challenge as AAP works on diminished presence and the possible risk of workers jumping ship.Additionally, the 'underdogs' have the task of keeping the party's momentum going, and to work in hopes to regain the lost glory AAP had for two terms.Thus, while BJP’s sweeping victory dominated the election results, the winning AAP candidates proved that grassroots leaders and lesser-known names could still command the trust of voters over key leaders' assurances. As Delhi’s political landscape undergoes a drastic shift, these victories are AAP's silver lining in an otherwise dismal electoral performance.","Among the underdog winners were aaley mohammed iqbal and virender singh kadian while big losers inc;uding arvind kejriwal and manish sisodia.

The unprecedented fall

NEW DELHI: Revolution. New politics. Political startup. That's all echoed ten years back as people, particularly in New Delhi, witnessed a ""glint of hope"" radiating from Ram Lila Maidan.When the ruling Congress at the Centre faced heat over the unravelling of corruption cases in 2011, the iconic ground in Delhi galvanised the people against what seemed indomitable dispensation.At the centre of the historic Ram Lila Maidan protest were Anna Hazare and his protege Arvind Kejriwal , leading the masses with a key demand -- Jan Lok Pal .The India Against Corruption movement peaked when the Congress-led UPA regime ordered cops to infiltrate the historic ground to disperse the crowd. The move backfired. It earned the protest nationwide sympathy and made the chances of the government leaner.Unable to make a big impact from apolitical movement and lack of legislative might, team Kejriwal decided to float a party to bring a ""real change"" in India's political landscape.Consequently, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) came into existence on October 2, 2o12, which also marked the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.The political canvas was fresh and blank for Kejriwal to leave an indelible imprint in 2013 when he made his political debut against Sheila Dikshit-led Congress government.The promise of alternative politics served Kejriwal with a decent electoral dividend as he defeated Sheila Dikshit from the New Delhi seat by a whopping margin of 22,000 votes. However, the party failed to secure a majority as it won 28 seats, only 8 short of the magic mark.In a first surprise call, the AAP declared to form a government with Congress's support -- the same party protesting against which it had come to prominence. It was, however, seen as an arrangement to navigate through the deadlock the hung mandate had created.As expected, the government was short-lived as Kejriwal resigned in 49 days because the Lokpal Bill (anti-corruption law) was not passed due to alleged opposition from its ally Congress.In 2015, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) decimated the BJP and Congress by recording a landslide victory as it won 67 of the 70 seats in the Delhi assembly elections , halting the Modi juggernaut in its tracks.The AAP won more than 90 per cent of the seats, a feat achieved only twice before in Sikkim and Bihar.Driven by its strong focus on governance and welfare policies, the Kejriwal-led government implemented several popular schemes, such as free electricity (up to 200 units), free water (up to 20,000 litres), improved government schools, and Mohalla Clinics for healthcare. These initiatives resonated with the common people, particularly the lower and middle classes, who saw direct benefits in their daily lives.The strategy of projecting Kejriwal as a ""work-oriented leader"" helped AAP secure a massive victory, winning 62 out of 70 seats in the 2020 Delhi Assembly.AAP transitioned from a local party in Delhi to a national party after its massive breakthrough in the 2022 Punjab assembly elections, where Kejriwal's party won a landslide victory with 92 out of 117 seats, forming its second full-fledged state government. This victory established AAP as a key contender beyond Delhi.The two controversies that put AAP and Kejriwal's credibility under serious scrutiny were the 'sheesh mahal' and the Delhi liquor policy case, with critics arguing that the party, which once promised clean politics did not walk the talk.While the Sheesh Mahal controversy has dented Kejriwal’s image as a leader of simplicity, the liquor policy scam has given the opposition fresh ammunition to attack AAP’s anti-corruption stance. The party, however, remained defiant, insisting that both controversies were politically motivated.This came after several of the founding members of the party left the AAP, accusing Kejriwal of functioning in a ""dictatorial way"" and taking unilateral decisions.Riding high on the anti-incumbency and on the back of the corruption charges, AAP lost its Delhi bastion in the 2025 assembly election. The BJP has managed to breach Kejriwal's Delhi fortress to regain power after a gap of 27 years. The saffron party won 48 seats in the 70-seat assembly.When it rains it pours, as the adage goes, the AAP not only lost the election but its chief Arvind Kejriwal was also trounced by BJP's Parvesh Verma by more than 4,000 votes from the same New Delhi assembly seat, which Kejriwal used for his political debut.","Aam aadmi party (aap) came into existence on october 2, 2o12. In 2015, the party decimated the bjp and congress by recording a landslide victory. Aap won more than 90 per cent of the seats, a feat achieved only twice before in sikkim and bihar. The saffron party won 48 seats in the 70-seat assembly.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118066183,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1085073,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
