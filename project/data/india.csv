CHENNAI: Just a month after her wedding, Soni Bisht lost her husband, Sepoy Neeraj Singh Bhandari of 18 Kumaon Regiment , in an accident in Jan 2023. Instead of succumbing to grief, she chose to turn pain into purpose, honouring her late husband's dream by donning the Indian Army uniform as an officer.On Saturday, at the Officers Training Academy in Chennai, she marched forward in the Passing Out Parade as a warrior ready to serve.""When I learnt about the Veer Nari entry from officers of Kumaon Regiment, my father encouraged me to take this path,"" said Soni, daughter of retired subedar Kundan Singh of Brigade of Guards Battalion. ""It was an uphill battle, but I conquered every challenge,"" she said, beaming with pride after being commissioned into the Army Ordnance Corps.Among the newly commissioned officers was another cadet, Ved Vijay Neog from Jorhat, Assam, who earned his Indian Army commission after years of struggle. Recommended initially for the Indian Military Academy after graduation, Ved withdrew due to family hardships.In Delhi, he juggled jobs, making coffee by day and delivering food by night to survive. He later found work as a travel photographer with major brands, but his heart remained set on the uniform. Determined, he cleared the Combined Defence Services (CDS) exam and secured his place at the OTA.These two cadets were among the 133 officer cadets and 24 women officer cadets commissioned into various arms and services of the Indian Army. Additionally, five foreign officer cadets and seven women foreign officer cadets from five foreign nations completed their training.The reviewing officer, Lt Gen Johnson P Mathew, chief of Integrated Defence Staff, presented the Sword of Honour to Manya M Kumar, the OTA gold medal to Pragati Thakur, the silver medal to Manya M Kumar, and the bronze medal to Surjeet Yadav.

"Half of Gujarat Congress working for BJP, says Rahul Gandhi, vows purge",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/half-of-gujarat-congress-working-for-bjp-says-rahul-gandhi-vows-purge/articleshow/118810528.cms,"Rahul Gandhi. (Photo/PTI)

AHMEDABAD: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi called for a purge within the party's Gujarat unit, vowing to remove functionaries working covertly for BJP. Addressing party workers in Ahmedabad, Gandhi admitted Saturday that Congress had failed to meet public expectations in the state and stressed the need for an overhaul.""Gujarat is stuck and wants to find a way, but Congress in Gujarat is not in a position to show the way,"" he said. ""I am not ashamed or scared to say that we have not met the expectations of the people of Gujarat.""He highlighted that Congress still holds a 40% vote share in Gujarat and suggested that a modest increase could bring the party back to office. ""One out of every two persons in Gujarat is a Congress supporter. If we can increase our vote share by just 5%, Congress will come to power in the state,"" he said.Gandhi drew a sharp distinction between Congress members dedicated to the party's ideology and those who he accused of being disconnected from the people or colluding with BJP.""There are two types of people in the Gujarat Congress leadership and among workers,"" he said. ""One section is honest with the people, fights for them, respects them, and carries the Congress ideology in their heart. The other section is cut off from the people, does not respect them, and half of them are hand-in-glove with BJP.""He emphasised that without eliminating BJP loyalists within the party, public trust could not be regained.Gandhi urged Congress politicians at all levels to demonstrate complete loyalty to the party's ideology. ""They should carry Congress in their blood. Put the issue of winning and losing the elections aside. As soon as we do that, the people of Gujarat would like to join our organisation, and we will open the door for them,"" he said.His visit concluded with preparations for an AICC session, scheduled in Ahmedabad on April 8 and 9 - the first such session in the state in 64 years.Congress has struggled with defections in Gujarat before elections over the past decade. The party lost ground in 2012 assembly elections, 2017 Rajya Sabha polls when Ahmed Patel barely secured victory, and subsequent state and general elections. Its worst performance came in 2022 assembly elections, after which four more legislators defected, leaving Congress with just 12 seats in the assembly.State Congress president Shaktisinh Gohil affirmed that BJP ""sleeper cells"" (loyalists) in Congress would soon be identified. ""In the coming days, we will ensure that loyal Congress workers get leadership opportunities and not those who get elected on a Congress ticket but work for BJP,"" Gohil said.Congress MLA and Dalit activist Jignesh Mevani said: ""Only those Congress workers who will strongly fight against BJP for the rights of local communities will get leadership and tickets at all levels.""","Congress mp rahul gandhi calls for a purge within the party's gujarat unit.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi government on Saturday approved the Mahila Samridhi Yojana aimed at providing Rs 2,500 to women from economically weaker sections in Delhi, BJP national president JP Nadda announced on Saturday.Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta , while making the announcement on Women's Day , said, ""Today is Women's Day.

Officials confirmed on Saturday that the agency is working closely with the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) to dismantle these operations, PTI reported.The move comes after the recent arrest of Kannada actress Ranya Rao, who was caught carrying 14.2 kg of gold worth Rs 12.56 crore at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport . Two CBI teams have been dispatched to Mumbai and Bengaluru airports to collect further information.Ranya Rao, known for her roles in Kannada films like Maanikya and Pataki, was detained by the DRI upon her arrival from Dubai on March 3. Authorities allege that she was attempting to smuggle 17 gold bars, weighing 14.8 kg, into the country. She was produced before a special court for financial offences on March 4 and has been remanded in judicial custody until March 18. The court has permitted her to meet her lawyer for half an hour each day and has instructed officials to ensure she is provided with basic necessities.Following her arrest, an image of Ranya with swollen eyes and bruises circulated on social media, sparking speculation of possible assault during custody, as per news agency PTI. Karnataka State Commission for Women Chairperson Nagalakshmi Chaudhary addressed the concerns but stated that the commission could not investigate unless a formal complaint was filed. She condemned any potential mistreatment, adding that no one has the right to take the law into their own hands.The case has also brought renewed scrutiny to the misuse of airport protocol services. Reports suggest that certain privileges meant for high-ranking officials were exploited to facilitate gold smuggling. In response, the Karnataka government has decided to revise standard operating procedures, restricting protocol services strictly to officials themselves, rather than their family members or associates. Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Umashankar SR confirmed the decision, stating that security measures would no longer extend to relatives of senior bureaucrats.Meanwhile, sources indicate that a protocol staffer at Kempegowda International Airport was briefly detained by the DRI after Ranya’s arrest. However, he was later released after stating that he had been instructed to receive a senior officer’s daughter and was unaware of the smuggling attempt.In a voluntary statement to the DRI, Ranya admitted to possession of the gold, acknowledging that 17 gold bars were recovered from her. She described herself as an artist, wildlife photographer, and real estate freelancer in Dubai.

NEW DELHI: One protestor was killed and 25 injured after clashes erupted between Kuki demonstrators and security forces in Manipur on the first day of ""free movement"" in the state since the violence began in 2023, which killed over 250 people.The Kuki Zo council has announced an indefinite shutdown in all Kuki-Zo areas starting Saturday midnight and warned against free movement of Meiteis across buffer zones.The unrest occurred in a Kuki-dominated district after police fired tear gas to disperse demonstrators protesting Union home minister Amit Shah’s directive on free movement across the state. The situation escalated as protesters set private vehicles ablaze and attempted to block a state transport bus traveling from Imphal to Senapati district.As the inter-district bus service resumed, a mob in the Gamgiphai area attacked a Senapati district-bound passenger bus by pelting it with stones, officials said. In response, security forces deployed tear gas and used batons to disperse the crowd.Further, officials said that nearly 114 weapons were recovered and seven member from the banned outfits in the state were arrested as an effort to bring back normalcy.The 'free movement' comes as a directive from the Union home minister Amit Shah, who had recently instructed security forces to guarantee unrestricted movement across all routes in the ethnic-strife torn state starting March 8, while also mandating strict action against those causing disruptions.Around 10 am, buses bound for the hill districts of Churachandpur and Senapati departed from Imphal airport without passengers, escorted by a large convoy of central forces, including army personnel, officials said.

BJP hits back

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said that the party needs to filter out leaders and workers in Gujarat who are allegedly aligned with the BJP and gave warning of strict action with the possibility of removal from the party.Addressing party workers in Ahmedabad during his two-day visit to the state, he hinted at a major overhaul ahead of the 2027 assembly elections and assured a strong strategy to challenge the ruling BJP.Gandhi said, “There are two types of people in the Gujarat Congress leadership and among workers. Those who are honest with people, fight for them, respect them and have the ideology of the Congress in their heart. And the others who are cut off from the people, sit far away, do not respect them and half of whom are with the BJP.”He said that the party’s first task should be to differentiate between these two groups. “Until these groups are separated, the people of Gujarat will not believe in the party,” he asserted, adding that even strict action, including expelling certain individuals, might be necessary.Gandhi pointed out that Congress has been out of power in Gujarat for over 30 years and said regaining public trust should take priority over election victories. “The question is not about elections. Unless we fulfill our responsibilities, the people of Gujarat will not let us win,” he said, adding that once the party reconnects with the public, electoral success will follow.During his address, Gandhi also criticised the state of Gujarat’s industries, particularly the diamond, textile, and ceramic sectors, which he claimed were struggling. “Look at the farmers of Gujarat. They are screaming for a new vision. The vision of the last 20-25 years has failed, and Congress can provide this vision easily,” he said.Gandhi also acknowledged the historical role of Gujarat in shaping Congress and India’s freedom movement. He reminded party workers that Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel, two of the Congress’s most influential leaders, hailed from the state. “Without Gandhi, Congress would not have been able to get independence for the country,” he said.Gandhi noted internal challenges within the party, asserting that some Congress leaders were “chained” and needed to re-establish their connection with the people. He encouraged party members to engage with citizens and understand their concerns. “We are here to listen to you,” he told the gathering.He further stated that Congress could return to power in Gujarat with a small increase in vote share. “The opposition already holds 40 per cent of the vote in Gujarat. If we can increase our vote share by just 5 per cent, the entire political equation will change,” he explained, citing Telangana as an example where the party increased its vote share by 22 per cent.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla criticised Rahul Gandhi, calling him the ""BJP's biggest asset"" and mocking his remarks about Congress workers. “He has trolled himself and his party. He tried to show the mirror to himself. Such an honest reaction... Rahul Gandhi admits he is unable to win in Gujarat, unable to show the way,” Poonawalla said.Referring to Gandhi’s analogy comparing some Congress workers to racehorses forced to dance at weddings, Poonawalla questioned his choice of words. “Are your party workers animals? At least please call your party workers humans. You are calling them horses,” he said.Taking to social media platform X, Poonawalla further attacked Gandhi, calling his remarks ""bizarre"" and listing a series of questions. “Rahul Gandhi has once again proven he is the OG when it comes to bizarre comments... Mr Entitled Dynast, stop calling Congress workers ‘ghoda’—they are humans. Stop blaming others for your failures—first EVMs, now party workers, who next? The public?” he wrote. He also took a dig at Gandhi’s electoral record, saying, “If half of Congress is ‘gaddar,’ what are you for making Congress lose 90+ times?”BJP Rajya Sabha MP Sudhanshu Trivedi also slammed Gandhi, stating, “From alleging his party, people, constitutional institutions, and media—he has now started blaming his own people. I’ll suggest he do self-introspection instead of blaming others.”On the first day of his visit, Gandhi had met with party leaders and district and block-level presidents to discuss strategies. His visit comes ahead of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) session, scheduled to be held in Ahmedabad on April 8-9, the first such session in the state in 64 years.In the 2022 Gujarat Assembly elections, Congress secured only 17 out of 182 seats, and its strength later dropped to 12 after five MLAs resigned. Gandhi admitted that the party had failed to meet Gujarat’s expectations over the past 30 years and promised corrective measures.He concluded his address with a mix of determination and humour, remarking on Gujarat’s hospitality. “Every time I come here, no matter how much I try to control my weight, you take me to restaurants and serve delicious snacks, and I end up gaining a kilo!” he joked, drawing laughter from the audience.","Congress leader rahul gandhi says party needs to filter out 'bjp-influenced' workers.

Can’t you find a safe house in Delhi, judge asks Agusta accused

NEW DELHI: Christian Michel James , one of the alleged middlemen in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper case who was granted bail by Delhi high court earlier this week, appeared before a city court on Friday and submitted that he could not accept it and wanted to go back to custody as Delhi was unsafe for him.Saying that because of ""security risks"", he would rather finish his sentence and leave India instead of being released on bail, he submitted before the court of special judge Sanjeev Aggarwal, ""I can't accept the bail. It's unsafe. Every time I step out of Tihar, something happens. The problem I am having is with police. I'd rather talk to you in private.""When the judge asked about his well-being, James said Delhi was just a larger prison for him. He mentioned something happened in AIIMS that he would rather talk to the court about in private.Christian Michel James was extradited from the UAE in 2018 in Rs 3600-crore money laundering case registered by ED. Later in the day, the court imposed the necessary bail conditions for releasing him. After James asked the court to talk in private, the judge sent the mediapersons and police outside the courtroom.Earlier this week, while granting him bail, HC said it was an exceptional situation where the accused was in custody for over 6.2 years but the trial had not yet commenced due to incomplete investigation. On Feb 18, Supreme Court had granted him bail in a related CBI case subject to terms and conditions decided by the trial court. In both cases, the court directed James to furnish a personal bond and surety of Rs 5 lakh each, at which James said, “How can a person who has been in jail for six years produce local sureties?”When James said that he did not want to be released on bail, the judge said, “Can’t you find a safehouse in Delhi?” James was extradited from Dubai in Dec 2018 and was subsequently arrested by CBI and ED. James is among the three alleged middlemen being probed and the other two are Guido Haschke and Carlo Gerosa. CBI, in its chargesheet, claimed an estimated loss of 398.21 million euros (about Rs 2,666 crore) to the exchequer due to the deal that was signed on Feb 8, 2010, for the supply of VVIP choppers worth 556.262 million euros.
