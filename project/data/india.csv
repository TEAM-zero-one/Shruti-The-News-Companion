Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Thursday directed his ministry to work out the details for carrying out the exercise which will also determine the best and worst performers.The minister issued this direction while chairing a day-long brainstorming session on road safety with officials from different ministries, state govts and experts. Sources said the ministry will work with the Niti Aayog to finalise the parameters.Gadkari also instructed officials to integrate “safe school zone” while planning construction and expansion of roads. District road safety committees (DRSCs) will include this provision while evaluating any plan, sources said. DRSCs will play a crucial role in the implementation of the Centre’s major schemes such as cashless treatment to road crash victims and giving financial rewards to good samaritans who take crash victims to hospitals for immediate medical care.Sources said responding to a suggestion on the need to have experts to assist DRSCs, road transport secretary V Umashankar said industry bodies such as CII and FICCI can extend their support.","Road transport minister nitin gadkari on thursday directed his ministry to work out the details for carrying out the exercise.

""It became a practice with them.

He added that those responsible for the attack will be held accountable and given appropriate response.""Today, they should not think that by killing 27 citizens, they have won the war. I want to tell all the perpetrators of terrorism that this is not the end of the fight but only a turning point... ek makam hai, har vyakti ko chun-chun kar jawab milega, jawab bhi liya jayega (each one involved will be given a fitting response and will be held accountable too),"" Shah said in his first public speech after the slaughter of tourists at Pahalgam.Shah, who was addressing a meeting after the unveiling of the statue of Upendranath Brahma, a leading figure among the Bodos, in Delhi, asserted that the fight against terrorists and their backers would continue until each one of perpetrators is punished.Shah said BJP govt, under PM Modi's leadership, has effectively tackled terror threats everywhere - be it in the northeast, areas impacted by left-wing extremism, or in Kashmir - and has given befitting responses. ""If anyone thinks that a cowardly attack is their big victory, they must remember this is Narendra Modi's India - none will be spared. Our resolve is to uproot terrorism from every inch of India, and it will become a reality,"" he added.Soon after the terror attack, the home minister had rushed to Srinagar and visited Baisaran meadow in Pahalgam. He met the grieving families and vowed that the ""culprits of this dastardly terror attack will not be spared"".Last week, the PM in his first remarks at a public event in Bihar, had issued a similar warning. ""We will go to the ends of the earth to find the perpetrators,"" he had said.Shah, in his address, said no Bodo should have an inferiority complex; they have the same rights in the country as the home minister himself.Recalling the signing of Bodo Accord in 2020 after nine months of discussions, Shah said everyone dropped their weapons and joined the mainstream. ""I want to tell all tribes that BJP govt honours the pacts it signs. We are implementing several agreements that were signed before us. They (earlier govts) did not follow them. We have cleared 96% of issues that were part of Bodo Accord. We will resolve 100% issues before next election in Assam,"" he added.The home minister said that Modi govt has signed over 20 accords in the northeast and over 10,000 people have surrendered and integrated inro the society. ""On an average, 78% of the issues have been resolved in the past four years...

His presence at the event and praise for the TMC supremo have sparked strong reactions within the BJP, with now Swapan Dasgupta calling the move a “betrayal”.""The outrage among grassroots BJP Bengal workers at this apparent betrayal by a former state president is too deafening for the national leadership to ignore,"" Dasgupta wrote on X.The controversy comes at a time when BJP is actively trying to push Mamata Banerjee in a corner over Murshidabad communal violence. Ghosh attended the temple event on Wednesday and later spoke with Banerjee, pictures and videos of which have been widely shared on social media.On the other hand, leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari skipped the programme altogether, choosing instead to address a religious gathering in Contai, just a few kilometres away from Digha. Bengal BJP chief Sukanta Majumdar distanced the party from Ghosh’s actions, calling his visit a “personal decision” that the party did not endorse.Ghosh, who visited the temple with his wife, said there was no party directive barring attendance, and even if there had been, he would not have followed it. ""I like to visit temples, and the party cannot bar me from paying tribute to Lord Jagannath. Even if there was any whip, I would not have paid heed to it,"" he said. He also described the state government’s invitation as an ""honour"" and said that temple visits were part of Hindu cultural life.In contrast, Majumdar pointed to the recent violence in Murshidabad, saying the BJP had collectively decided not to attend the temple’s inauguration in protest.

NEW DELHI: More than 32 years after a man sexually assaulted a 10-year-old girl, the long arm of the law finally caught up with him as Supreme Court overturned a trial court verdict acquitting the then 21-year-old, who is now 54, and ordered him to undergo a 10-year sentence.""We would like to know who this daredevil sessions judge is who acquitted the man despite forensic science laboratory report, and statements of doctors and duty magistrate corroborating the girl's version of sexual assault,"" SC said while upholding a Gujarat HC decision to set aside the trial court verdict.A year after the incident, the additional sessions judge, Ahmedabad (rural), in Oct 1994 acquitted the man, who was charged with sexually assaulting the girl in an agricultural field. The injured girl was taken to hospital and the relatives waited for the sarpanch to come to help them in filing the FIR. Medical examination proved she was raped.The trial court, without taking into consideration the circumstances, had recorded the delay of 48 hours in FIR registration as one of the grounds for acquitting the accused.The appeal filed by the state in HC remained pending for 30 years. Finally, a bench of Justices Aniruddha P Mayee and Divyesh A Joshi, on Nov 14 last year, set aside the trial court decision to acquit the man. It convicted him under Sections 376 and 506 of IPC and sentenced him to imprisonment for 10 years and a fine of Rs 10,000.Rejecting arguments for not imposing any sentence after 31 years on the man, who is now married and has a family to support, HC had said, “If a perpetrator of a crime is set free, the concept of deterrent theory may not work and there might be adverse effect on society. Moreover, it is a 10-year-old girl who was subjected to sexual assault.” The SC bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh, agreeing with the HC judgment, revoked its order of Nov 14 last year and ordered the convict to surrender within a week.","Sc orders rape convict to surrender within a week.

A distant relative, he claims, manipulated authorities to serve deportation notices to him and eight of his siblings — all in an alleged bid to seize their ancestral property of 17 acres in J&K Poonch district.“I think a revenue official, who is our distant relative, influenced the authorities and they sent us notices without confirmation. He wanted to grab my land. It should be investigated,” Ali said Thursday. “How can a conspiracy driven by greed for land rob me of my children, my country, and put us to such agony?”The 45-year-old head constable posted at the Vaishno Devi shrine’s Katra base camp was on official duty in Jammu on April 26 when he was handed a deportation order by local police. The notice, issued by the Poonch DC, directed him and his siblings — three brothers and five sisters, all between 45 and 65 — to leave India by April 29 and cross into Pakistan.“The notice was in my hand and suddenly, from a police officer I became a person without a country,” Ali said.The orders followed the Centre’s directive to identify and deport Pakistani nationals in the wake of the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam. Somehow, despite his govt job and decades of residency, Ali’s name was included.His department intervened, sparing him from immediate deportation and keeping him at Gandhi Nagar police station in Jammu. His siblings, however, were put on the road to the Attari border in Punjab. At home, his wife Shahnaz Kousar and their three children — 12-year-old Nawaish, 9-year-old Ayaan, and 7-year-old Ziyaan — were left in anguish.“I cannot describe how I have spent the past seven days. I was living a hell,” Ali said. “When a man dies, he is buried in a grave. Here I am alive and I was thinking I couldn’t be with my children ever.”Ali’s roots in India run deep. His father Faqir Din was a hereditary state subject and an Indian citizen under the 1955 Citizenship Act. During the 1965 war, Din and his family were forced into PoK when their village Salwah came under Pakistani control. There, six more children, including Iftkhar, were born. The family returned to J&K in the 1980s and were officially granted state subject status in 1997.On April 29, J&K high court stayed the deportation. “Outside the police station in Poonch on Thursday evening, I felt back in life,” Ali said. “I am happy now, but will the trauma of this week live with us for long?”","J&k police head constable iftkhar ali believes it was a land dispute that nearly tore apart his life, his family, and his identity as an indian citizen.

With Aaron Rodgers undecided, Kirk Cousins emerges as top alternative

The Pittsburgh Steelers are currently facing a pivotal moment in their quarterback strategy, with two high-profile names in the spotlight Aaron Rodgers and Kirk Cousins. The team has reportedly offered Rodgers a one-year deal worth $10 million in hopes of bringing his leadership and experience to Pittsburgh. However, Rodgers, now nearing the twilight of his career, has yet to make a firm decision, potentially weighing retirement or a more favorable opportunity.Aaron Rodgers’ indecision has led the Steelers to look at backup options, and Kirk Cousins has emerged as a serious contender. Cousins, who signed a massive four-year, $180 million contract with the Atlanta Falcons, recently found himself unexpectedly sidelined. The Falcons chose to start rookie quarterback Michael Penix Jr., leaving Cousins' future with the team in doubt. Frustrated by the move, Cousins is now open to joining another team where he can continue as a starter, and the Steelers may offer that chance.Just days ahead of the 2025 NFL Draft, reports from The Athletic’s Dianna Russini suggest that a potential three-team trade is gaining momentum between the Browns, Steelers, and Vikings one that could include veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins. With Cousins openly expressing his desire to move on from the Falcons, Pittsburgh is shaping up to be the most appealing landing spot for him.""It's believed that Cousins would be against any trade that involves sending him to a situation involving a young QB, similar to the situation he faced in Atlanta last year,"" Russini stated, alluding to the entry of rookie Michael Penix Jr., who overtook Cousins for the starting role during the 2024 campaign.Despite his availability, Cousins brings both promise and concern. On the one hand, he offers veteran experience and consistent performance in the regular season. On the other hand, he has a reputation for struggling under pressure, particularly in high-stakes games, and he posted a high number of interceptions in his last season. For the Steelers, who prioritize ball control and limiting turnovers, this could be a significant red flag.Financially, bringing Kirk Cousins to Pittsburgh won’t be easy. His contract is massive, and the Falcons are reportedly seeking a team willing to take on a substantial portion of his salary. This could become a major obstacle unless both teams agree to a restructuring deal. Still, if the Steelers decide that Cousins is the right fit, they may be willing to negotiate.Currently, the Steelers' quarterback depth includes Mason Rudolph, Skylar Thompson, and rookie Will Howard. While all three have potential, none bring the same level of experience or immediate impact that Rodgers or Cousins could offer. The Steelers are clearly looking for a proven starter to elevate their playoff hopes in a competitive AFC.Also Read: Are the Jets setting themselves up for disaster? Ignoring defensive tackles in record-breaking NFL Draft could be a colossal mistake In the end, the decision hinges on Aaron Rodgers’ choice. If he declines, the Steelers must weigh whether Kirk Cousins is worth the financial and performance risk. Either way, Pittsburgh Steelers appears committed to making a bold move at quarterback in 2025.","Pittsburgh steelers have reportedly offered aaron rodgers a one-year deal worth $10 million.
