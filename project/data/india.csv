Delhi’s Air Quality Deteriorates Sharply to ‘Red Zone’ as Diwali Fireworks Trigger Severe Pollution

Last Oct, hotelier Ankit Gupta flew to Delhi from Panaji to celebrate Diwali with his parents in Maharani Bagh, an upscale residential area in South-East Delhi. Within hours, he developed a sinus infection. Ten days later, he remained on medication, struggling with respiratory problems.“Every friend of mine in Delhi is suffering from some form of respiratory illness,” Gupta said.Gupta, his wife Meenakshi Rajput (45) and 10-year-old daughter had moved to Goa in Jan 2024 after repeated bouts of respiratory problems left them scrambling for sanity, amid repeated visits to doctors’ chambers.Families that uprooted themselves from Delhi to settle in Goa — with great reluctance at first — are glad they made the shift.Delhi’s 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) on Diwali touched 345, in the ‘very poor’ category — the highest since 2021, when it had reached 382. Toxic smoke caused PM2.5 levels to soar to 675 micrograms per cubic metre at midnight, again the worst since 2021.PM2.5, or particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less, are tiny airborne particles that pose significant health risks when inhaled.Because of how small they are, they can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream, leading to respiratory and cardiovascular problems, including asthma, coughing, breathing difficulties, and increased risk of conditions like lung cancer, heart disease, and stroke.Mumbai, too, saw a sharp rise, with AQI levels up 9% on Diwali, compared to the night before.“Our respiratory issues were getting worse,” said Gupta. “We had chronic bouts of respiratory illness after every Diwali. Given our health concerns, we had no choice but to move. My daughter developed an adenoid infection because of respiratory illness and we had to get them surgically removed. We were asked by our doctors to go to a cleaner area. Delhi is like a gas chamber.”For Prashant Kalra and his wife, their decision to relocate was driven by concern about their daughter’s health. He put up a post on Instagram recently, explaining why — as a responsible father and a husband — he took the seemingly “reckless” decision. His post soon went viral, with many joining in and sharing their own reasons for leaving Gurugram and Delhi.“We were on a road trip in 2018, around Diwali,” Kalra said. “We were headed to a boutique hotel in Rajasthan to escape the Diwali pollution. While on that trip, our very boutiquey hotel decided to have a Diwali firework display, which prompted a coughing bout from our daughter. At that point, we decided that the north was no longer going to be home, and that a relocation was unavoidable.”In 2019, the Kalras made the journey south, seeking refuge in Goa, where the air was free from toxic smog.“Young parents like us are looking for cleaner air for our kids,” Kalra explained. “The main challenges are giving up work, the social circle, the convenience of a big city, the fear of the unknown and similar issues. But increasingly, there are parents who just don’t have a choice as their kids are getting sicker each year.”Gupta and Kalra are part of a growing tribe of Indian parents fleeing the deadly air pollution that envelops the country’s metros. These ‘pollution refugees’ have found that Goa’s palm-tinged villages and sunny climes are kinder to their lungs.On Aug 6, 2022, four-year-old Damian (name changed) lay gasping for breath at Hiranandani Hospital in Powai, an upscale suburb in Central Mumbai. His fretful parents watched their son, his face dwarfed by the oxygen mask that was helping his lungs.Midnight visits to the emergency room had become routine for Damian’s parents. This was not the first time that they had seen doctors pump steroids and medicines into the wiry frame of their boy. But it would be the last, they decided.“We realised that this was the tipping point for us,” said Damian’s father, Lionel. “Our company was going remote and there was nothing keeping us in Mumbai any more.”Musician Stefan Kaye and his wife were in the same boat. Their move away from the national capital began with the search for suitable schools for their three-year old daughter.“It got to a stage where we were checking schools to see if they had air purifiers in every room and if the children were made to exercise outdoors or indoors. There were serious ramifications for her health and we were dissatisfied with the facilities that schools had to counter the effects of pollution,” Kaye said.The Kayes could feel their eyes stinging in Delhi because of the toxins in the air. “There used to be a yellow haze, and we always had a burning sensation at the back of our throat. This can take years of your life,” said Kaye, who now lives in Goa.According to the India State Level Disease Burden Initiative study published in The Lancet, one out of every eight deaths in India is attributable to air pollution. The study says that the average life expectancy in India would have been 1.7 years higher, had the air pollution level been less than the minimal level causing health loss.The ambient air quality in Delhi dances between hazardous and very severe. A deadly cocktail of construction dust, vehicular emissions and ash from crop burning chokes the national capital region, which fumes from firecrackers only exacerbates.“We moved to Goa because the health of our daughter was a real concern. As parents, we felt that it was irresponsible to raise a child and almost negligent in a way to live in Delhi,” Kaye said.","Delhi’s 24-hour average air quality index (aqi) on diwali touched 345, in the ‘very poor’ category.

Why Sushant Singh Rajput inspires this Left candidate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-sushant-singh-rajput-inspires-this-left-candidate/articleshow/124774479.cms,"Acting and activism

A different script

PATNA: The famous Sinha library was closed. But outside the gate, Divya Gautam, still in her teens and in the middle of a break from structured education, saw the poster of a film fest, named Cinema of Resistance. Some of the movies she saw that week, Iranian auteur Majid Majidi’s ‘Children of Heaven’, and the documentaries of displacement and forest rights by the Jharkhand filmmaker duo, Meghnath and Biju Toppo, including their aching ‘Gadi Lohardaga Mail’, stayed with her long after the lights came on.It was the beginning of a realisation for Divya that she wanted to do something different. “I wasn’t really interested in the bazaar of competitive examinations for wannabe engineers. I failed the tests,” says the 34-yearold theatre activist-cum-academic, also an unusual CPIML (Liberation) candidate contesting the Digha assembly seat in suburban Patna in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections Divya is also a cousin of Sushant Singh Rajput , the promising Hindi film star (‘Kai Po Che!’, ‘MS Dhoni: The Untold Story’, ‘Chhichhore’) who was found dead at his Mumbai residence in 2020.Sushant was five years older than her. Both started their acting careers in theatre. Then their trajectories changed. Sushant moved to Hindi cinema.After joining college, Divya found herself drawn towards Left cultural groups that reflected her own sensibilities.She started working in college theatre and with study groups associated with the radical Left party. In Patna College, the Saharsa-born daughter of an engineer and homemaker acted in plays like Mannu Bhandari’s ‘Mahabhoj’, discussed Occupy The Wall Street movement with fellow students and showed films such as ‘Modern Times’ to underline how capitalism dehumanises people.From culture, Divya gradually moved towards a more active role in campus politics. As a student of mass communication, she mobilised fellow students for better facilities at the department. “There was no camera, no newspaper, no studio, no library, only lectures,” she recalls. The movement achieved limited success.In 2012, Divya took the big step of agreeing to contest for the president’s post on an AISA ticket in the students’ union election. She lost narrowly to the ABVP candidate. This was also the time when she formally joined CPIML(L). When the Nirbhaya rape horror happened a few months later, she took to the streets, staging plays such as ‘Bekhauf Azaadi’ and highlighting the need for women’s agency and the importance of consent.It’s been a long and twisted journey since then. Divya has post-graduated in women’s studies from TISS, Hyderabad, worked on rural development and land rights in Jharkhand, cleared and dumped state civil service, taught mass communication in Patna’s Women’s College, and acted in Italian dramatist Dario Fo’s plays while working on her PhD on ‘Caste, class and masculinity in Bhojpuri stardom’. “I refused the govt job because I knew I won’t be able to speak up,” she says.A few weeks back when the party asked her to contest from Digha, a seat that BJP retained, polling 57% votes in 2020, she readily agreed. CPIML(L) had got 30% of the votes cast.Santosh Sahar of CPIML(L)’s central committee says that voters in Digha are predominantly middle class. “As an educated woman, who has always spoken up for gender rights, and has been committed to the rights of the marginalised, Divya was a good choice for the seat,” he says.Divya has started campaigning and says “there are so many issues”. “Unemployment, absence of quality education for the youth, migration... We have a Patliputra Industrial Area, but no industries,” she said.The activist-academic points to the city’s open drains, harassment of daily-wagers, atrocities against the urban poor and the ‘saffron’ politics of polarisation.She also talks about Sushant, who taught her mathematics when she was a kid and whose work she admires and is inspired by. “I remember him as an artiste,” she says. “No matter what, I will always do 1-2 plays every year. It will be my tribute to the theatre and him.”","Divya gautam is contesting the digha assembly seat in suburban patna in the upcoming bihar assembly elections.

Bihar polls: BJP almost confirms Nitish Kumar is NDA’s CM pick,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-bjp-almost-confirms-nitish-kumar-is-ndas-cm-pick/articleshow/124773868.cms,"""Congress Only Party To Respect Him..."" Pappu Yadav Alleges BJP Sidelining Nitish Kumar in NDA

PATNA: Nitish Kumar is the leader and CM of NDA govt in Bihar and people trust him and PM Narendra Modi to deliver on their promises in the state, BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said Thursday while NDA tore into INDIA bloc after the opposition named RJD ’s Tejashwi Prasad as its chief ministerial face before elections in Nov. NDA called the bloc’s move a “shameful alliance of corruption and opportunism”.“Charges have already been framed against Tejashwi in the IRCTC case. The court has stated that this is a very serious case of corruption. Tejashwi is an accused in this case under Section 420 of the IPC,” Prasad said. When reporters asked him who will be the NDA’s CM face, Prasad said: “Where is a vacancy?”BJP, JDU, and LJP (Ram Vilas) functionaries — joined by political strategist-turned-activist Prashant Kishor — accused the opposition bloc of pushing Bihar toward a “return of jungle raj” under the shadow of the alleged scam. Bihar deputy CM Samrat Choudhary of BJP said RJD was “torturing even its allies”. “This is a day of shame for Bihar that Grand Alliance promised to make the son of a thief the CM for sake of power. Everyone knows when Lalu was in office, criminals were encouraged. They want to bring back the same govt, and Congress is encouraging this.”The IRCTC land-for-jobs scam dates back to the period when RJD chief Lalu Prasad, as railway minister during first UPA govt of 2004-2009, allegedly awarded contracts for two railway hotels in exchange for land plots transferred to a firm linked to his family.Both Lalu and Tejashwi have denied wrongdoing, calling the case politically motivated.UP deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya said RJD-Congress tie-up was “a mismatched game”, recalling that Lalu was jailed during Congress’s tenure. “Now he is aligned with the same Congress. This alliance will not work in Bihar,” Maurya said.Union minister and LJP (RV) chief Chirag Paswan mocked the alliance for sidelining Congress. “After so many controversies, what would they do if they accepted your face? Congress was insulted as the face of just one man was visible in the entire press conference,” he said.JDU targeted both Tejashwi and INDIA bloc’s social arithmetic, taking a swipe at reports VIP chief Mukesh Sahani was promised the deputy CM post. “Laddoos for 2.60% of the Mallahs, pumpkins for 18% of the Muslims. Are Muslims there only to scare them to vote?” JDU wrote on X.Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor ridiculed Tejashwi’s promise to provide govt jobs to one member of every family. “The one who promises three crore jobs isn’t saying what he did when his parents were in power. Now all that’s left to hear is that Tejashwi will make Bihar a golden Lanka in a few days,” he said.BJP national spokesperson Ajay Alok said Congress had “sold its self-respect” by agreeing to Tejashwi’s projection. “Sitting on a stage where Rahul Gandhi’s photo was not even on the poster, Ashok Gehlot exposed his party’s helplessness by declaring Tejashwi as CM face.... Let Nov 14 come, they will be seen fighting each other,” he said, referring to the date of poll results.","""congress only party to respect him..."" pappu yadav alleges bjp sidelining nitish kumar in nda in bihar.

The case had been registered by Vadakkencherry police after parents complained that the teacher struck their children on the legs during class at 10am on Sept 16, 2019. The complaint was lodged four days later on Sept 20.The court said there was no explanation for the delay and no proof the children suffered injuries, indicating that only minimal force was used. It found that the teacher had “no intention to cause harm beyond what was necessary to enforce discipline” and had acted with restraint.Calling the prosecution “unfortunate”, the court said parents failed to appreciate the teacher’s intentions. It said when a child is entrusted to a teacher, there is implied consent for the teacher to exercise parental authority to correct the pupil.With that reasoning, HC quashed the criminal proceedings, affirming a teacher’s right to maintain discipline within reasonable limits.","Kerala high court quashes criminal case against a schoolteacher who caned three class 5 students for fighting.

In such circumstances, the court is obliged to restore the party to the very position he would have occupied had the error not occurred,” the bench said.SC accepted there was an omission on its part, wherein it did not clarify in its judgment that possession of a building in Chandigarh would be handed over upon receipt of amount awarded by it. Taking advantage of its omission, an “unscrupulous litigant” refused to hand over the possession of the building despite being paid Rs 2 crore as directed by the apex court.In this case, the litigant had agreed to buy the property in 1989, paid an advance of Rs 25,000 and took possession of the property.But soon litigation started and the property’s ownership could not be transferred to him. Thirty-nine years down the line, SC brought the litigation to an end by directing he should be paid Rs 2 crore in lieu of the earnest money of Rs 25,000 that was paid in 1989. However, SC, while delivering its judgment, did not mention that he, in turn, had to hand over the possession of the property to its owner. This led to a fresh round litigation as the owner approached trial court and then Punjab and Haryana HC, which granted order in his favour.The apex court upheld the order passed by the courts and imposed a cost of Rs 10 lakh on the “unscrupulous litigant” — the buyer.","The maxim ‘actus curiae neminem gravabit’ is a principle firmly embedded in indian jurisprudence.

NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), saying he had joined the party “because of circumstances.” Reaffirming his commitment to the NDA , he said he is “back in NDA for good.” He also criticised the RJD’s rule before his 20-year tenure as chief minister, saying, “pehle bahut bura haal tha,” and highlighted the shortcomings of the Lalu-Rabri governments, taking aim at their administration.Addressing his first election rally in Minapur, Muzaffarpur, Kumar took a dig at his rival Lalu Prasad and said, “Because of circumstances, I had to tie up with those people, but it did not take me long to realise that they were good for nothing. Now I am back (in NDA) for good.”Kumar recalled that his earlier alliances with the RJD in 2015 and 2022 both lasted less than two years. On both occasions, Lalu’s son Tejashwi Yadav, now leader of the opposition in Vidhan Sabha, served as his deputy chief minister.He highlighted his government’s focus on improving infrastructure, education, and healthcare in Bihar, and praised the Narendra Modi government at the Centre for its support.Talking about law and order, Kumar said, “An atmosphere of terror had prevailed in Bihar because of poor law and order and alleged patronage to criminals by the powers that be, until I took over. But now, it is for all to see how much things have changed.”He added that communal harmony has also improved. “Even disputes between Hindus and Muslims have come down because we were sensitive to needs like fencing of religious places of both faiths,” he said.Taking a swipe at Lalu Prasad, Kumar accused him of ignoring women’s welfare during his tenure. “Did the ones in power do anything for women? They could not have cared less. Only when, after seven years of chief ministership, a situation came where stepping down could not have been avoided, the wife was installed,” he said, referring to Rabri Devi’s appointment as chief minister in 1997.Kumar contrasted this with his own government’s focus on women’s empowerment, citing the success of self-help groups and the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, under which Rs 10,000 each has been transferred to over one crore women beneficiaries.Seeking a record fifth consecutive term, Nitish Kumar said he was disillusioned with the RJD after two short-lived alliances and has now decided to stay with the NDA for good.","Bihar chief minister nitish kumar reflected on his past alliances with the rashtriya janata dal.

Of the remaining 20, 11 bodies have been identified, while 9 are yet to be identified. She observed that the bus door got jammed and did not open after the fire broke out.DIG Koya Praveen said that while the impact with the bike ignited the fire, the combustible materials inside the bus contributed to many deaths. He added that the bus’s fuel tank remained intact and noted that the vehicle lacked adequate safety measures to prevent or mitigate such fire incidents.Within minutes, the blaze engulfed the entire vehicle, trapping several passengers inside.Twelve people managed to escape through windows, many with burn injuries, while others were charred to death as the fire spread rapidly.Rescue and firefighting operations continued through the morning, and officials said the exact toll would be confirmed after cooling efforts were complete.Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu expressed condolences to the victims’ families and directed officials to provide immediate relief and medical assistance to the injured.The Kurnool tragedy comes just days after a similar bus fire in Rajasthan, where 22 people, including three children, were killed when a Jaisalmer–Jodhpur bus caught fire near Thaiyat village on October 14.Investigations into the Rajasthan incident revealed that a short circuit in the air-conditioning system triggered the blaze.

"Over 6,000 voters deleted for Rs 80 each in Aland: Karnataka SIT",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/over-6000-voters-deleted-for-rs-80-each-in-aland-karnataka-sit/articleshow/124771870.cms,"Rahul Gandhi Reveals '100% Proof Of Vote Chori', Accuses CEC Gyanesh Of Protecting Vote Thief

Deletions took place using VoIP between Dec 2022 & Feb 2023





BENGALURU: Karnataka police’s special investigation team probing the alleged voter deletion scam in Aland constituency during the 2023 assembly polls has reportedly uncovered evidence of attempts to remove names from the electoral rolls, and identified six suspects.Sleuths said deletions were carried out at a cyber centre in Aland, where operators were allegedly paid Rs 80 per application. SIT sources said they suspect accused paid Rs 4.8 lakh to those who facilitated the deletions. Officials are probing how the centre gained access to EC’s portal to file fake voter deletion requests. The probe was carried out by CID cyber crime unit before SIT took over. “At least 6,000 votes have been allegedly deleted,” a CID official said.According to CID sources, preliminary findings show that the deletions took place between Dec 2022 and Feb 2023 using voice over internet protocol (VoIP). “There were requests to delete 6,994 votes. While a few were genuine, most were bogus. The applications allegedly targeted Dalit and minority voters. The deletions were halted after the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) ordered a status quo,” CID officials said.The irregularities have been traced to local resident Mohammed Ashfaq, who was questioned in Feb 2023 and let off. He is currently in Dubai and a blue corner notice is being processed to locate him.Aland, part of Kalaburagi district, is represented by Congress MLA B R Patil. He along with Kalaburagi district minister Priyank Kharge were the first to flag the irregularities to the CEO. The Congress govt later formed the SIT, headed by Additional Director General of Police B K Singh, after Rahul Gandhi raised allegations of vote theft in Aland— the home turf of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge.Reacting to the reports, Priyank Kharge posted on X: ``Voters deleted for just Rs 80 in Aland. The latest findings from the Karnataka SIT confirm what we've been saying all along, over 6,000 genuine voters were struck off the rolls through a paid operation ahead of the 2023 elections in Aland. A full-fledged data centre was operating out of Kalaburagi, where operators were systematically deleting voters' names and tampering with our democratic process. All investigations now point to foul play by BJP functionaries and their associates. Every dirty trick and modus operandi from the BJP's #VoteChori playbook will be exposed, and every single person responsible will be held accountable and put behind bars.”On Oct 17, SIT searched the residences of former BJP MLA Subhash Guttedar, his sons, and their chartered accountant Mallikarjun Mahantagol, seizing seven laptops and several mobile phones.Following the revelations, Congress accused the BJP of vote theft, calling it a direct assault on democracy. “The truth about the BJP's vote theft is now before the country. The cost of deleting a vote was Rs 80. This exposé pertains to just one assembly seat. This 'vote theft' by BJP is a direct attack on democracy—where the rights of the poor and marginalised are being snatched, and their voices suppressed,” the party posted on X.Aland MLA BR Patil said he is unaware of the headway made by SIT and declined to comment, adding, “SIT is moving in the right direction.”","Sleuths said deletions were carried out at a cyber centre in aland, where operators were allegedly paid rs 80 per application.

"From rushing trains to crowd control, Railways uses real-time map to manage Chhath rush",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-rushing-trains-to-crowd-control-railways-uses-real-time-map-to-manage-chhath-rush/articleshow/124771994.cms,"Viral Video: IRCTC Staff Fight At Delhi’s Nizamuddin Station, 4 Suspended, Rs 5 Lakh Fine Imposed

NEW DELHI: To deal with the upcoming Chhath rush, the railways is using real-time heat-mapping of 35 major stations to monitor heavy passenger movement, rushing standby unreserved trains close to these stations to clear the surge of travellers and creating holding areas for crowd control. These measures are based on passenger data from the festive seasons of the past two years, including this Diwali.In a massive operation, the national transporter is set to run around 13,000 special services before and after the biggest festival of Bihar — nearly double than the number of trains operated last year — to ferry an estimated more than 2.5 crore passengers, similar to the population of Australia.Special trains are in addition to normal trains that the railways operates. Most of these trains are headed for poll-bound Bihar.The number of special trains was determined through analysis of past two years of data, which was fed into a model to assess the demand for each destination, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said. He added that micro monitoring is being done at three levels — divisional, zonal and at the Railway Board.Sources said that freight services on identified routes have been minimised to clear the rush and even Dedicated Freight Corridors are being used.Vaishnaw said on Oct 19 (a day before Diwali), there was a sudden surge of passengers at the Udhna station in Gujarat. “As soon as this started showing on the heat map, passengers were put in queue and a standby unreserved train in the vicinity was moved to clear the traffic build up,” he added. Officials said two special trains were operated from Udhna to Jayanagar in Bihar on that day to clear the rush.There was a similar situation at Ambala in Haryana on Tuesday and the railways followed suit to deal with the situation. “We have three categories — normal traffic, crowded situations and overcrowding. Once there are signs of overcrowding, the entire system moves swiftly to deal with the situation,” Vaishnaw said. He added that learning from earlier experiences, the railways increased the number of destinations in Bihar from 7-8 in 2024 to 28. “We identified the closest station for the convenience of passengers,” the minister said.Vaishnaw also said that the railways has issued orders for construction of permanent holding areas at 76 high footfall railway stations such as Mumbai, Howrah, Lucknow, Guwahati, Bhubaneshwar, Chennai, and Patna, and Secunderabad, Bengaluru, Tirupati, and Ujjain, among others.","The railways is using real-time heat-mapping of 35 major stations to monitor heavy passenger movement.

Bihar polls: Mukesh Sahani emerges as Mahagathbandhan's wildcard; is Congress the weakest link?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-mukesh-sahani-emerges-as-mahagathbandhans-wildcard-is-congress-the-weakest-link/articleshow/124766308.cms,"Tejashwi Yadav Named CM Face, BJP Retaliates with ‘Weak Alliance’ Remark at Mahagathbandhan

Tejashwi formally declared CM face, Sahani named his deputy





Mukesh Sahani: From political exile to deputy CM face





Congress on shaky ground?





The weakest link?





NEW DELHI: The Mahagathbandhan on Thursday announced Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial candidate and Mukesh Sahani as the deputy CM face ahead of the Bihar assembly elections. While Tejashwi’s candidature was widely expected, Sahani’s unexpected rise - from a one-time NDA ally often dismissed by rivals to a key power centre within the alliance has become the defining development, signalling a shift in the coalition’s caste arithmetic and leadership dynamics.Behind the show of unity, however, tensions simmer. As Sahani celebrates his political revival, Congress appears to be the uneasy partner in this new equation. Grassroots dissatisfaction over ticket distribution, coupled with its declining influence in seat-sharing talks, raises questions about whether the grand old party is losing ground within Bihar’s opposition bloc.The Mahagathbandhan formally announced Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and former deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial face for the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections. Alongside, Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) chief Mukesh Sahani was declared the alliance’s deputy chief ministerial candidate.The announcement, made during a joint press conference of alliance partners in Patna, ended weeks of speculation over leadership and marked a new phase of coordination within the opposition bloc.Senior Congress leader and election observer Ashok Gehlot said, “All of us sitting here have decided that in these elections, we support Tejashwi Yadav as the CM face.”He confirmed that the Mahagathbandhan would contest the upcoming polls in complete unity, adding that Sahani would serve as Tejashwi’s deputy if the alliance comes to power.Mukesh Sahani’s recent elevation marks a remarkable political comeback. The Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) had originally been part of the Mahagathbandhan, but disagreements over seat-sharing—stemming from the Rashtriya Janata Dal’s reluctance to prioritise smaller allies—led Sahani to exit the coalition. He later joined the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and was allotted 11 seats in the 2020 Bihar elections. Although Sahani lost his own contest, his party managed to win four seats.Sahani was subsequently elected to the Bihar Legislative Council, albeit for a shorter term of one and a half years, which expired in July 2022.Once an NDA ally, Sahani faced political isolation after his fallout with the BJP. His decision to contest against the BJP in both the Bihar Legislative Council and Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections further marginalized him, with several VIP MLAs defecting to the BJP in 2022. In the 2022 Uttar Pradesh elections, Sahani announced plans to field 160 candidates to “oust the incumbent BJP government,” and in Bihar, he fielded 55 candidates against his former ally—but none won. Following these setbacks, a BJP MLA suggested that Sahani’s political chapter in Bihar was over, hinting at his removal as minister and even a potential internal coup within the VIP. Sahani also defied NDA seat-sharing arrangements in the Bihar Legislative Council elections, fielding seven candidates against the BJP once again.In 2025, however, Sahani has staged a political revival, now named the deputy chief ministerial candidate of the opposition bloc.Speaking to reporters in Patna ahead of the announcement, he appeared confident: “Why would I have a problem with anything? Can't you tolerate so much happiness on my face? Mahagathbandhan is moving forward very strongly.”His elevation seems a calculated strategy by the Mahagathbandhan to consolidate Nishad (fishermen) votes and appeal to smaller caste groups that have drifted away from the major alliances. The support base for the Vikassheel Insaan Party consists mainly of the Nishad, Nonia, Bind, Beldar community, which comprises 20 sub-castes of fisherman and boatmen. It also signals social inclusivity — a card the RJD-led bloc has traditionally used effectively in Bihar’s caste-driven politics.While the alliance celebrated unity on stage, discontent brewed within the Congress. In recent weeks, several party workers have expressed anger over the ticket distribution process, alleging bias and manipulation by senior leaders in charge of Bihar affairs.Congress worker Munna Shahi told ANI, “Those whom Rahul Gandhi had entrusted and sent here are from the five-star hotel culture, and they don't like to be brought down to poor ashrams here... We have only one demand, 'ticket chor, gaddi chod'... The selection process has lost its basis. Only eye wash remains now.”After the Congress CEC meeting on Bihar polls, another worker said, “It was said that those people who will be on the screening committee, those who will have their online application will be given tickets. But a few leaders like Krishna Allavaru and Rajesh Ram are making women work hard and go from door to door but cheating them at the end. The promise made by Rahul Gandhi, to honour the youth and women is being broken by Krishna Allavaru. We, the Congress workers, will not stand it. Bihar will not accept it.”Interestingly, on Thursday elevating Congress also replaced Allavaru as Youth Congress chief and brought in Manish Sharma.The internal tensions in the recent weeks by local leaders point to a widening gap between the Congress high command and its state unit. This recurring issue has hurt the party’s performance in multiple states.The Mahagathbandhan’s recalibrated leadership matrix leaves the Congress in an uncomfortable spot. With the RJD holding the chief ministerial claim and the VIP now rewarded with the deputy slot, Congress finds itself without a distinct bargaining chip. Its performance in the 2020 polls, where it contested 70 seats but won only 19, has weakened its ability to negotiate.The current configuration suggests a more RJD-centric alliance, with Tejashwi and Sahani symbolising the blend of legacy and new social representation, while Congress remains peripheral.The joint manifesto of the Mahagathbandhan is set to be released on October 28, after Chhath Puja, with Congress leaders Mallikarjun Kharge and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra expected to join the campaign. However, unless it manages to address internal dissent and project a clear message, Congress could risk further erosion in Bihar’s evolving political narrative.The Bihar assembly elections will be held in two phases on November 6 and 11, with results scheduled for November 14. The Mahagathbandhan — comprising RJD, Congress, CPI, CPI(M), CPI-ML, and Mukesh Sahani’s VIP — faces the NDA alliance led by BJP and JD(U), along with the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) and HAM(S).",The mahagathbandhan announced tejashwi yadav as its chief ministerial candidate for the 2025 bihar assembly elections.

MP: 300 suffer eye injuries after firing carbide guns; 30 may lose sight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mp-300-suffer-eye-injuries-after-firing-carbide-guns-30-may-lose-sight/articleshow/124771807.cms,"Despite curbs, e-comm sites continued to offer carbide-based cannons



BHOPAL: Diwali celebrations turned tragic in Madhya Pradesh when about 300 people, including children , suffered severe to minor eye injuries after they “fired” carbide guns, or agri-cannons, used mainly by farmers to scare away monkeys and birds, on Monday and Tuesday. As many as 30 of them are said to be serious and could lose their sight.Deputy CM Rajendra Shukla said, “A review meeting was called as soon as we got to know. Seven children were seriously injured in Bhopal and admitted in Hamidia hospital, some in Gwalior and Vidisha.Carbide guns have a mixture of calcium carbide, matchstick heads, and gunpowder, officials said. While adding water to calcium carbide generates acetylene gas, ignition creates powerful explosions that result in intense heat, noxious gases, and projectiles. Unofficial reports suggested 300 cases of varying degrees of “alkali injury”, which can cause permanent damage.Doctors at AIIMS-Bhopal said there were two primary types of injury to the eye — acid and alkali. While acid injuries tend to be less severe due to limited penetration, alkali injuries are significantly dangerous.“Alkali eye injuries cause irreversible damage and treatment focuses on preventing further deterioration.In some cases, vision loss may occur. Of the patients admitted to AIIMS-Bhopal, only one has sustained injuries in both eyes,” said Dr Bhavana Sharma, head of department of ophthalmology at AIIMS-Bhopal.While most of the cases were reported from Bhopal and a few neighbouring districts and were being treated in hospitals here, about 50 were reported from Gwalior and Jabalpur.Bhopal chief medical and health officer Dr Manish Sharma said there were 13 patients at AIIMS-Bhopal and 12 at Gandhi Medical College on Thursday. One critical case was sent to AIIMS-Delhi. The others were discharged. He said 15 in Bhopal underwent surgical procedure.Nearly three dozen cases were reported from Bhopal while additional patients were referred from neighbouring Vidisha and Hoshangabad districts. While about 150 patients were treated in Bhopal, many were being treated in district hospitals, he added.Officials said carbide guns, marketed online as “PVC monkey repeller gun”, emerged as alternatives to traditional fireworks.Authorities identified the issue two weeks before Diwali and implemented curbs. Govt had also put a ban on its sale and use. The devices, priced between Rs 150 and Rs 200, were marketed as entertainment items in the open market while their price ranged from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000 on e-commerce platforms.Police on Thursday seized at least 42 carbide guns being sold on the roadside, along with 1.5kg of calcium carbide explosives. A vendor was arrested and booked under Section 288 of BNS. He was later released on bail.Despite restrictions, e-commerce platforms continued to offer carbide-based cannons.","As many as 30 of them are said to be serious and could lose their sight.

Poll Do you support the Supreme Court's ruling allowing minors to challenge property sales by guardians? Yes, it's a fair decision. No, it could lead to confusion.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has ruled that minors can challenge any property sale or transfer done by their parents or guardians without a lawsuit, after turning 18.The court said adults can cancel such transfers by taking clear actions, like selling or transferring the property themselves.""It can safely be concluded that a voidable transaction executed by the guardian of the minor can be repudiated and ignored by the minor within time on attaining majority either by instituting a suit for setting aside the voidable transaction or by repudiating the same by his unequivocal conduct,"" Justice Mithal, authoring the judgment, said.The verdict came in K S Shivappa vs Smt K Neelamma case. The case involved two plots in Shamanur village, Karnataka, bought in 1971 by Rudrappa in the names of his three minor sons.Rudrappa sold the plots without court permission. After the sons became adults, they sold the plots to K S Shivappa. Third parties who had bought the plots earlier claimed ownership, leading to disputes.Lower courts were divided on whether the minors needed to file a suit to cancel the original sale. The Supreme Court clarified that a formal suit is not needed. Adults can repudiate the guardian’s sale by acting clearly, such as selling the property themselves.The court added that sometimes, minors may not even know about the original sale, or the property may still be in their possession, so filing a suit is not always necessary.","The verdict came in k s shivappa vs smt k neelamma case.

Muslim representation shrinks sharply



NEW DELHI: As Bihar gears up for the assembly elections, the ruling National Democratic Alliance and the opposition Mahagathbandhan have cornered each other over issues such as development, migration, and unemployment. However, it all appears to have boiled down to the perennial theme of caste-based politics, with every party fine-tuning its manifesto and candidate list to gauge how various caste communities will vote and how best to retain their traditional voter bases.Swearing by Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur’s legacy of social justice, a caste survey was conducted in Bihar in 2023 to determine the exact population of each caste, aiming to bolster demands for expanded quotas.The survey found that the EBCs constitute the largest portion at 36 per cent, along with the other backward classes at 27 per cent, which amounts to 63 per cent of the total 13.07 crore population of the state; together, they constitute the socially hefty segment of backward classes. Meanwhile, the “upper caste” groups among Hindus account for only 10.6 per cent.However, the caste proportions seem unlikely to be reflected in the Bihar Vidhan Sabha after the results, as parties appear to be prioritising their traditional voter bases and other factors over population-based representation during the screening of candidates.In the upcoming assembly elections, parties have not only fielded candidates from dominant castes to strengthen their poll prospects but have also calibrated diverse caste combinations to counter caste hegemony across regions.Under the seat-sharing deal between NDA partners, BJP was allotted 101 seats. Riding on the vote banks of the upper castes, BJP gave 49 tickets (48.5%) to upper-caste candidates. Meanwhile, 34 candidates (33.7%) from the OBC community were fielded, including 6 Yadavs, 15 Vaishyas, 7 Kushwahas, and 2 Kurmis.Only 10 EBC candidates (9.9%) and 12 SC candidates (11.9%) are in the poll fray with BJP's symbol.Interestingly, BJP had fielded only 16 Yadavs in 2020 assembly elections. The choice of BJP’s replacements for some of its sitting Yadav MLAs points to its new gameplan: it has gone for a Kushwaha, the most populous OBC community after Yadavs; a Nishad, an increasingly assertive extremely backward classes group; and a Vaishya, the party's traditional supporter, for the Patna Sahib, Aurai and Munger seats, respectively.Chief minister Nitish Kumar's JD(U) has fielded the most candidates from the OBC, EBC, and SC communities.Nitish, who has positioned himself as the poster boy of non-Yadav OBCs and EBCs, has fielded 37 candidates from the OBC community (36.6%) and 22 candidates from the EBC community (21.8%).Additionally, 15 candidates from the SC community (14.9%) and 1 candidate from the ST community (1.0%) are in the poll fray. JD(U) has also distributed tickets to 22 (21.8%) candidates from the upper-caste community in the upcoming assembly elections.Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), which was allotted 29 seats under the seat-sharing, has fielded five candidates each from the Rajput and Yadav castes, and four each from Paswan and Bhumihar communities.Meanwhile, Chirag Paswan fielded one candidate each from Brahmin, Teli, Pasi, Sudhi, Rauniyar, Kanu, Rajwar, Dhobi, Kushwaha, Ravidas, and Muslim communities.Union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi's Hindustani Awam Morcha has fielded six candidates in the poll fray. Out of the six candidates, the party has fielded four of Manjhi’s relatives and two Bhumihar candidates.Meanwhile, Upendra Kushwaha 's Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM) fielded one Bhumihar, one Rajput, three Kushwahas, and one Vaishya candidate.Catering to its traditional vote banks of Yadavs and Muslims, the Rashtriya Janata Dal has distributed tickets to 51 Yadavs out of 143 seats. The party has also fielded candidates from upper-caste and EBC communities. With Mahagathbandhan parties contesting a total of 255 seats, several constituencies are witnessing “friendly fights” among alliance partners.In total, the RJD has fielded 18 Kurmi-Kushwaha, 51 Yadavs, 8 Vaishyas, 14 upper castes, 33 EBCs, 19 SCs, and 18 Muslims in the upcoming elections.Contesting on 61 seats, the Congress has fielded nearly one-third—21 candidates—from upper-caste communities. The party’s lineup also includes 5 Yadavs, 6 EBCs, 3 Vaishyas, and 12 SC candidates.CPM-L has put forward 3 Koeris, 2 Yadavs, 1 Rajput, 1 EBC, 6 SCs, and 1 Muslim, aiming to make inroads in key constituencies.Muskesh Sahni's VIP is contesting on 15 seats with 3 Yadav, 1 Kurmi-Kushwaha, 2 Upper caste, 1 SC and 8 EBC candidates to target specific voter groups.CPM has fielded 1 Koeri, 1 Yadav, and 1 SC candidate for the upcoming assembly elections.CPI has nominated 2 Yadavs, 1 Bhumihar, and 3 SC candidates to contest in the polls.IIP has fielded 1 Vaishya and 1 EBC candidate for the elections.Muslim representation in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections has seen a noticeable decline, particularly within the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The Janata Dal (United), the only NDA constituent to field Muslim candidates — has given tickets to just four Muslim contenders this time, compared to 14 in the previous election.The move is being seen as chief minister Nitish Kumar’s acknowledgment that the community’s support has largely shifted towards the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD).On the opposition side, RJD has fielded 18 Muslim candidates, staying true to its traditional Yadav-Muslim base, while the Congress has allotted tickets to 10 Muslim aspirants.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar assembly elections. The 243 assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the counting of votes scheduled to take place on November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, while there were 7.89 crore electors as of June 24 this year. An Election Commission press release stated that 65 lakh voters were removed from the draft list, and the number of electors in the draft list as of August 1, 2025, stood at 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly election, the BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share. The Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with a 15.7% vote share. The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) contested seven seats, winning four, and achieved 0.9% of the vote share.","Bihar assembly elections to be held on may 12.

Court junks ‘frivolous’ Ayodhya verdict plea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/court-junks-frivolous-ayodhya-verdict-plea/articleshow/124772227.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has dismissed lawyer Mehmood Pracha’s plea seeking to declare Supreme Court ’s 2019 Ayodhya judgment “null and void”, calling it a “frivolous and luxurious” attempt to misuse the legal system. District judge Dharmender Rana not only upheld a Rs 1 lakh penalty imposed by a civil court but also added Rs 5 lakh more to “deter” similar cases.Supreme Court’s Ayodhya verdict had unanimously awarded the disputed site to the deity Ram Lalla Virajman for temple construction, while granting Muslims a separate five-acre plot in Ayodhya to build a mosque.Pracha had filed the suit after alleging that former CJI DY Chandrachud publicly said in Pune that the Ayodhya judgment reflected a “solution provided by Bhagwan Shri Ram Lala Virajman”. He said this amounted to fraud and sought a fresh adjudication of the case.Judge Rana rejected the claim outright, observing that “seeking guidance from the almighty cannot be berated as a fraudulent act to gain unfair advantage, either in law or in any religion”. Quoting Hindu and Islamic scriptures, he said “Aham Brahma Asmi” embodies unity with the divine, and even the Quran allows devotees to seek guidance from Allah.Calling Pracha’s petition an “abuse of the process of law”, the judge said the lawyer’s insistence on impleading the former CJI “soon after his retirement” revealed an “oblique intent”. He said Pracha had challenged the verdict “without even bothering to go through it” and had no standing since he was not a party to the Ayodhya case.“The already overburdened dockets of the court cannot afford the menace of luxurious and frivolous litigation,” Judge Rana said. He warned of a growing trend where “unscrupulous litigants” target public officials after they leave office, adding that courts must ensure a “peaceful and pleasant evening” to those who served the nation. “The situation becomes distressful when the protector himself turns predator,” the judge remarked. “In this case, the appellant, despite being a fairly senior counsel, has opted to choose the wrong colour of jersey. Instead of participating in the solution, he has opted to augment the problem.”Judge Rana said both courts and the legal fraternity must act as sentinels to “sieve out impurities at the entry gates themselves”, underscoring the need to “deal with such litigation with an iron hand”.",A delhi court has dismissed lawyer mehmood pracha’s plea seeking to declare supreme court ’s 2019 ayodhya judgment “null and void” the district judge dharmender rana upheld a rs 1 lakh penalty imposed by a civil court but also added rs 5 lakh more to “deter” similar cases.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124772225,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-744366,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

"Not just JEE rank, Olympiads & sports to be gateway to IIT-Kharagpur",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/not-just-jee-rank-olympiads-sports-to-be-gateway-to-iit-kharagpur/articleshow/124772211.cms,"KOLKATA: A JEE rank may not be mandatory for admissions to IIT Kharagpur in the future, as the institute is set to introduce alternative admission pathways apart from the usual JEE Advanced route from the next academic session for its BTech and BS programmes.Authorities pointed out that the move was aimed at attracting students from diverse backgrounds. One of the criteria in the alternative system would be that students must qualify for the JEE Advanced exam, either on the common rank list or category-wise list.“The Senate, in principle, approved that from the next academic session, we will be admitting students through alternate routes without disturbing the primary channel of admission through JEE Advanced. The institute is exploring different possibilities — like Sports Excellence Admission (SEA) and Science Olympiad Excellence Admissions (SCOPE) — as a benchmark of acceptance. But the final modalities are yet to be finalised,” said director Suman Chakraborty. “One of the criteria will be that students must qualify for the JEE Advanced exam, but their ranks should not be a deciding factor,” he added.Chakraborty felt the main purpose of the initiative was to make the admission process inclusive and attract a diverse range of students.Several IITs — like IIT Madras, IIT Kanpur, IIT Bombay, IIT Gandhinagar, and IIT Indore — offer admission through Olympiad and sports excellence pathways in addition to the standard JEE route.“A committee will be formed with representatives from each department to fix the modalities and oversee the implementation of this pathway of admission. We will be consulting the protocols of other IITs who have already implemented it,” an IIT Kharagpur official said.A campus source said the eligible Olympiad competitions proposed include International Mathematical Olympiad, International Physics Olympiad, International Chemistry Olympiad, International Biology Olympiad, and International Olympiad in Informatics.“The proposal also includes creating a few supernumerary seats focusing on students excelling in national and international Olympiads. Getting an opportunity to attend the training camp of an Olympiad is itself an impressive achievement and reflects on the academic preparation of the students. The idea is to recognise academic excellence beyond the conventional entrance exams,” an official said.In case of admission through SEA, it has been proposed that candidates must obtain at least one medal in the last four years from sports achievements in any national or international-level competitions, a source said. Some of the eligible competitions proposed include World Championship, Olympics, Commonwealth Championship, SAF Games, Senior National, Federation Cup, All India Inter-University, and Khelo India University Games.",Iit kharagpur is set to introduce alternative admission pathways apart from the usual jee advanced route for its btech and bs programmes.
