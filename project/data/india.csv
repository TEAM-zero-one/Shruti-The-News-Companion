"Voter 'fraud' row: INDIA bloc MPs to march from Parliament to EC; 'no permission,' say police",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/voter-fraud-row-india-bloc-mps-to-march-from-parliament-to-ec-no-permission-say-police/articleshow/123227133.cms,"NEW DELHI: The INDIA bloc on Monday announced plans to march from Parliament to Election Commission's office, drawing a response from Delhi Police, who said no permission had been sought for the protest.Police officials clarified that no formal request or application had been received for the demonstration.The opposition coalition had said the march was to protest the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in poll-bound Bihar and alleged “voter fraud” in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.On Sunday, senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh said the INDIA bloc MPs had marched from Parliament to the Election Commission’s office to register their protest. At a press conference, he alleged, “All the Booth Level Officers (BLOs) were filling out ‘fake forms’ in one room.”Singh further stated, “ Rahul Gandhi put forward such facts that no one could deny... The name of one person appeared at multiple locations, including polling booths... Rahul Gandhi’s demand was for electronic data of the voter list, which could be scanned using software to determine how many votes were cast on a single EPIC number...The reason for the SIR happening in Bihar was questioned. It had been thoroughly tested in 2003, which took 2 years in Bihar, but this time they wanted to do it in 1 month. ..”He added, “All the BLOs were filling out fake forms in one room. The Election Commission said that so many people had died, but their list was not provided... And MPs of the entire INDIA alliance, from all parties except the BJP and NDA alliance MPs, had marched from the Parliament to the Election Commission’s office...”The announcement of the march came days after Rahul Gandhi’s press briefing in which he made serious allegations against the poll body.On August 1, Union minister Kiren Rijiju responded, saying the government was open to discussions but not on the SIR. “I want to clarify that the government is ready to hold discussions on any issue as per the rules. There cannot be a discussion on SIR because it is a process undertaken by a Constitutional body, and it is not happening for the first time...” he told ANI.",The opposition coalition had said the march was to protest the special intensive revision (sir) of electoral rolls in poll-bound bihar.

'ECI is not a court': Chidambaram slams poll body over SIR; terms refusal to hear complaints 'death of democracy',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eci-is-not-a-court-chidambaram-slams-poll-body-over-sir-terms-refusal-to-hear-complaints-death-of-democracy/articleshow/123226362.cms,"P Chidambaram (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader and former Union minister P Chidambaram on Sunday lashed out at the Election Commission of India (ECI), asserting that it is “not a court” and must not act like one while dealing with petitions or complaints.In a post on X, Chidambaram wrote, “The ECI is not a court and cannot behave like a court in entertaining petitions or complaints. It is an administrative body tasked with ensuring free and fair elections.”Clarifying the scope of Rule 20(3)(b), he said it applies only when an Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) accepts or rejects a specific claim to be included in the electoral rolls -- not in cases of alleged large-scale manipulation of an entire assembly constituency’s rolls.Citing a newspaper report, he alleged that complaints from Booth Level Agents in Bihar are being ignored. “If true, this refusal to entertain complaints during the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) will spell the death of democratic elections,” he warned, adding that the ECI’s duty extends beyond mere procedure to safeguarding the rights of political parties and voters.Meanwhile, the Election Commission has reiterated its stand that Rahul Gandhi must either submit supporting documents for his recent ""vote theft"" allegations or apologise.The reminder follows a notice from the Karnataka Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) and a follow-up from the Haryana CEO.In an August 10 letter, the Karnataka CEO said Rahul Gandhi had, during his August 7 press conference, cited ECI records to allege that a voter named Shakun Rani voted twice, based on data shown by a polling officer.However, the voter has denied the charge, and officials said the tick-marked document displayed by Rahul Gandhi was not issued by the polling officer, raising doubts about its authenticity.The Karnataka CEO has asked Rahul Gandhi to share the original documents forming the basis of his claim so a detailed investigation can be carried out.","Congress leader and former union minister p chidambaram lashed out at the election commission of india.

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India B R Gavai and Justice Surya Kant, who is next in line to succeed him, have disapproved of the tendency of judges of superior courts to comment on the knowledge and ability of lower court judges, and said the Supreme Court and high courts are only to correct, modify impugned orders/judgments, or set them aside, if they were perverse.""The high courts are not subordinate to the SC as both are constitutional courts. SC can only rectify, modify or set aside the orders/judgments of HCs. The Constitution gives no authority to comment on the ability, capability or knowledge of individual judges of HCs,"" the CJI told TOI.Justice Kant agreed. ""Superior court judges must discharge their role as friend, philosopher and guide for lower court judges. In the three-tiered justice delivery system, persuasion and guidance yields better results than criticism and castigation,"" Justice Kant, who'll take over from Gavai on Nov 24, told TOI.Remarks of the CJI as well as Justice Kant assume significance in the wake of an SC bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan criticising an Allahabad HC judge for passing ""the worst and most erroneous order"" and barring him from hearing criminal cases. The bench Friday expunged its directions for de-rostering the judge while requesting the HC chief justice to look into the matter.Endorsing the vision encapsulated in the saying 'a judge who has not committed a mistake is yet to be born', CJI B R Gavai told TOI that the same principle applies to HC judges, who should refrain from castigating judicial officers on the ground of lack of ability, knowledge or capability while hearing appeals against impugned orders authored by them.""They must administratively convey how to improve and in which area. For that, HC CJs concerned have a significant role to play. The role of superior courts in imparting required training to lower court judges in various aspects of adjudication, acquiring knowledge in myriad fields of law and maintaining proper demeanour and decorum in the courtroom will shape the future of the justice delivery system and reinforce people's faith in judiciary,"" the CJI said.Justice Kant said HC judges and judicial officers come from various social strata and bring with them a wealth of real-life experiences which can be harnessed, modulated and sharpened with legal training to enrich the justice delivery system to meet day-to-day challenges of open court hearing and address grievances of litigants.""On the judicial side, SC has no authority to dictate to HCs which of their judges would hear what types of cases or the manner in which cases are to be decided. It can only lead by example and guide them with its judgments. Allocation of cases to judges and their roster squarely falls in the exclusive domain of the HC CJ concerned,"" Justice Kant said.CJI Gavai said, ""Every constitutional court judge, be it in HCs or in SC, has the constitutional responsibility to do justice in each case, whether criminal or civil or any other field of law. Superior court judges have the onerous duty to maintain civility while passing orders or writing judgments.""",Sc has no authority to dictate rosters of hcs: justice kant.

Whose white tiger is it? Turf war over shifting safari in MP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whose-white-tiger-is-it-turf-war-over-shifting-safari-in-mp/articleshow/123225053.cms,"BHOPAL: Claws are out in a grey-area tussle over a white tiger safari in Madhya Pradesh. Who keeps the legacy of Mohan, a big cat captured as a cub in 1951 by then maharaja of Rewa that went on to become the progenitor of nearly all white tigers in captivity in the world? This question has turned a seemingly routine govt redrawing of district maps in MP into a massive turf war.After a letter from Maihar district administration on Aug 7 suggested that Mukundpur - home to the world's only White Tiger Safari - should be moved to neighbouring Rewa, politicians and common people of both districts are at loggerheads. While those in Rewa say it is a ""homecoming"", people in Maihar are up in arms against this move, heating up politics in the Vindhya region.The letter proposes shifting Mukundpur and five neighbouring panchayats - Anandgarh, Amin, Dhobahat, Parsiya and Papra - from Maihar to Rewa district, citing recommendations from the state's Administrative Boundaries Reorganisation Commission. On paper, it's a matter of redrawing maps. On the ground, it's a tug-of-war over history, tourism revenue and political prestige.For Rewa, the safari is more than just an attraction - it's a birthright. Mohan's stuffed remains still guard the Rewa palace museum, his story etched into the region's identity.Bringing the safari into Rewa's official borders, supporters argue, would ""bring Mohan home"".But in Maihar's Amarpatan belt, the move has landed like a hostile takeover.Satna MP Ganesh Singh has called it ""a calculated conspiracy"", while BJP veteran and former minister Ramkhilawan Patel vowed that the villages ""will remain in Maihar"". Congress heavyweight and former Speaker Rajendra Kumar Singh has gone further, accusing deputy CM Rajendra Shukla of engineering the shift to ""grab the White Tiger Safari"" and calling for a Gandhian-style satyagraha, even suggesting ""filling Maihar jail"" in protest.Opponents allege the timing was no accident: the letter was issued a day after the assembly session was abruptly ended, they claim, to prevent debate by the local MLA. Singh has warned villagers to expect ""pressure"" from officials to sign off on the transfer, urging them to resist ""local Mir Jafars and Jaichands"".The stakes are high - not only does the safari draw tourists from across the country, but its brand value is unmatched in Madhya Pradesh's wildlife tourism. For now, the map hasn't changed. But in the Vindhya heartland, the battle over Mukundpur is fast becoming as much about political dominance as it is about a legendary tiger's legacy.","Mukundpur is home to the world's only white tiger safari in madhya pradesh.

‘Bharat Is Bharat’: Mohan Bhagwat’s Powerful Call To Protect India's Name, Soul, And Identity

NEW DELHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday expressed concerns over the increasing commercialisation of healthcare and education while speaking at an event in Indore. He said that both sectors, once considered acts of service, have now become unaffordable and inaccessible for the common man.“Health and education are extremely important and were earlier considered as ‘seva’ (service), but now both are beyond the reach of common people. Both have been commercialised. They are neither affordable nor accessible,” Bhagwat said at an event in Indore.Citing personal experience, Bhagwat recalled, “when I was a child, I had malaria and missed school for three days. My teacher came home, and brought jungle herbs for my treatment. He was concerned that the student who came to him should stay healthy. Society needs accessible and affordable healthcare.”Referring specifically to cancer care, he said, good cancer care is currently available in only 8-10 Indian cities, and stressed the need for healthcare that does not become a source of anxiety for patients.“We need low-cost, easily accessible medical care. Treatment should not turn into a cause of worry,” he added.Bhagwat also said that Western medical research cannot be uniformly applied across the world due to regional and individual differences.“Someone may benefit from naturopathy, others from homeopathy, no single way can be supreme. Indian medical systems treat based on personal needs,” he noted.On the education front, he pointed out that students still have to travel long distances for quality education, just as patients do for advanced healthcare.","Rss chief mohan bhagwat expressed concerns over the increasing commercialisation of healthcare and education.

The same set of people also met (Sena (UBT) chief) Uddhav Thackeray during the Lok Sabha (polls). We told them we believe in democracy and will win the Lok Sabha elections for sure, looking at the atmosphere in the country,"" Raut told the media, according to news agency PTI.""When they approached us again, we told them that as the opposition secured an overwhelming success (in Lok Sabha elections), we will come to power in Vidhan Sabha (assembly elections) too. They asked us to assign 60-65 difficult seats and promised victory through EVMs. However, Thackeray refused, saying we don't feel the need to do it.""He further recalled being ""warned"" by the persons that ""those in power"" (BJP-led Mahayuti) had prepared a ""plan"" through EVMs and electoral rolls to win.The BJP won 132 seats in the assembly elections with allies Shiv Sena and NCP adding 57 and 41 constituencies, respectively, to the Mahayuti tally.On the other hand, the MVA won only 46 seats (Shiv Sena (UBT) 20, Congress 16, and NCP (SP) 10).Pawar on Saturday caused a flutter in political circles with his remarks. The senior politician stated he introduced the two individuals to the Lok Sabha leader of the opposition and Congress MP, Rahul Gandhi.Gandhi on Thursday made explosive allegation of a ""huge criminal fraud"" in polls through ""collusion"" between the BJP and the Election Commission, citing an analysis in a constituency in Congress-ruled Karnataka, calling it ""a crime against the Constitution"".The following day, he alleged the Election Commission and the BJP ""colluded to steal"" the Lok Sabha elections from the people, and there was ""vote theft"" in at least three states.Maharashtra chief minister and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis has questioned the timing of Pawar's statement, which he dismissed as a ""Salim-Javed script.""","Shiv sena (ubt) mp sanjay raut on sunday alleged the same two unnamed individuals had also approached uddhav thackeray twice.

NEW DELHI: Can organs, say a kidney or the liver, retrieved from a deceased donor with a history of diabetes or hypertension be used for transplantation?In a first of its kind factual assessment and report, the Indian Society for Organ Transplantation (ISOT) has said the benefits far outweigh the risks involved and, therefore, such donations should be considered subject to the viability of the organ.According to the ISOT, while Indian data are lacking, international registries report hypertension in 15-20% and diabetes in 2-8% deceased donors. ""Evidence from the US Renal Data System (USRDS) and the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) databases suggests minimally increased risk of primary non-function, acute rejection, or delayed graft function (DGF) and marginally lower graft survival from such donors, particularly in kidney transplantation,"" the ISOT statement published in the Lancet Regional - South-east Asia says. It has been co-authored by doctors from 32 top medical institutions in the country, including AIIMS Delhi, Safdarjung hospital, Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani hospital Mumbai, Max Saket and Madras Medical College Chennai among others.Over time, diabetes that isn't well controlled can damage blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste from the blood. This can lead to kidney damage and cause high blood pressure. High blood pressure can cause more kidney damage by raising the pressure in the filtering system of the kidneys, according to the Mayo Clinic.Dr Dinesh Khullar, a leading nephrologist and co-author of the ISOT statement, said they have suggested a screening criterion to decide whether kidneys donated from a diabetic deceased donor can be considered or not. ""Outright rejection is wrong. In my view, doctors should carry out individualised risk assessment of the donor organ and recipient profile to reach a conclusion,"" he said.Dr Shiv Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences said organs from deceased donors with a history of diabetes, hypertension or cancer can be used on a case-to-case basis. ""A liver biopsy should be done to see the extent of fibrosis and fat in liver from a diabetic donor, as one-third may be unfit. Similar caution for hypertensive donors for kidney donation needed. Organ from a donor cured of cancer for over two years, should be acceptable. """,Indian society for organ transplantation says benefits far outweigh risks.

"Flash flood changes Bhagirathi course, river returns to old path",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/flash-flood-changes-bhagirathi-course-river-returns-to-old-path/articleshow/123224789.cms,"DEHRADUN: The flash flood in Dharali earlier this week reshaped the course of the Bhagirathi river, widening stream channels and altering river morphology, satellite images from the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) showed. The high-magnitude flood eroded a debris fan on Kheer Gad - a tributary of the Bhagirathi located just upstream of Dharali village - forcing it back to its earlier path and pushing the Bhagirathi towards the right bank.Satellite imagery from Isro's Cartosat-2S, comparing data from June 2024 and Aug 7 this year, revealed a vast fan-shaped debris deposit roughly 20 hectares in size - measuring about 750m by 450m - at the confluence of Kheer Gad and the Bhagirathi, just above Dharali. These images showed extensively altered river channels, submerged or buried buildings, and major topographical shifts.Piyoosh Rautela, senior geologist and former executive director of Uttarakhand State Disaster Management Authority, said pre-disaster images revealed a triangular debris fan on Kheer Gad's left bank, just upstream of its confluence with the Bhagirathi. ""This deposit was formed during a previous catastrophic downslope movement that diverted Kheer Gad's course at the time.Traditionally, such deposits were only used for agriculture, with homes built on higher, stable ground to avoid landslide and flood risk,"" he said.He added that rapid tourism growth and the pilgrim influx over the last decade, along with commercial activity near the road, had prompted settlement on the alluvial fan. ""The flash flood eroded the entire fan deposit and Kheer Gad reclaimed its previous course. Currently, the debris has pushed the Bhagirathi's flow towards the right bank, but it will eventually erode this deposit in time,"" he said.Hydrologists warned such sudden geomorphic changes could have cascading effects far downstream. Altered river channels can increase flow velocity, change sediment transport, and destabilise banks kilometres away from the flood site. Over time, this can create new erosion hotspots, threaten bridges, and change floodplains, forcing riverside communities to adapt to a new hydrological pattern.Dean at the School of Environment and Sustainability in Bangalore-based Indian Institute for Human Settlement, Dr Jagdish Krishnaswamy, who is an ecohydrologist and landscape ecologist, said the Himalayas' geology and climate make them prone to such shifts. ""These are the world's youngest mountains - tectonically active, geomorphologically dynamic, and generating some of the highest sediment loads globally. Glacier retreat, both natural and intensified by warming, releases vast amounts of debris, which intense rainfall can mobilise into avalanches and mudslides. This sediment can drastically alter river courses, especially where loose deposits exist on lower slopes or in narrow valleys,"" he said.He cautioned that embankments and retaining walls often give a ""false sense of security"" when infrastructure and homes are built on unstable ground. ""Given the Himalayas' dynamic geomorphology and the increasing intensity of rainfall, extreme caution is needed in designing and locating any infrastructure. Otherwise, we are exposing people and assets to unacceptably high risk,"" he said.","High-magnitude flood eroded debris fan on kheer gad - a tributary of the bhagirathi.

EC sources said ""tick marks"" against Shakun Rani's name on separate lists flagged by Rahul as ""EC data"" appeared fabricated, based on information in Form 17A maintained and retained by the respective polling officers.Access to Form 17A is limited to authorised EC officials and these are not shared with political parties. Polling agents of parties get polling records in Form 17C, which do not contain photographs. Form 17A is only produced if a court seeks it.Maharashtra's chief electoral officer S Chockalingam, who first wrote to Lok Sabha LoP on Aug 7, sent a reminder to submit his ""declaration/oath"" within 10 days so that proceedings could be initiated. In his first letter, the bureaucrat mentioned the dates on which the draft and final rolls had been shared with Congress, also pointing out that the party never filed first appeals with the district magistrates or second appeals with the election office. The letter specified that election results could only be contested in a high court. ""You are kindly requested to sign and return the enclosed Declaration/Oath under rule 20(3) (B) of the Registration of Electoral Rules 1960 with the names of such electors,"" it said.In an identical notice, Haryana CEO A Sreenivas gave Rahul 10 days to submit an affidavit under oath specifying his allegations about vote fraud along with supporting documents.A day after the presser, Sreenivas said his office had shared copies of electoral rolls with representatives of Congress during the meetings ahead of elections. The CEO said if the party doubted the fairness of the process, it would need to challenge the voting results in Punjab and Haryana HC and provide details of the ""claims and objections made before officials"".
