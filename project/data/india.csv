Poll What should be the top priority after the Pahalgam tragedy? Stronger counter-terror operations Justice for the victims

NEW DELHI: The trousers of around 20 victims of the dastardly Pahalgam attack - all males - were found unzipped or pulled down by the team of officials that carried out the first examination of the 26 lifeless, bullet-riddled bodies, in what is being seen as a confirmation that terrorists had established the faith of the tourists before killing them.A team comprising officers of the Army, J&K police and J&K administration found to their horror that clothing from the lower body of 20 of the 26 victims had been forcibly dislodged, with their pant zippers undone, pants pulled down, exposing their underwear or private parts. The victims' kin were possibly too much in shock to have noticed the state of the clothing on the bodies; even the staff retrieved the bodies as they were, simply covering them with a shroud.It was only the team of officers tasked with a thorough examination of the bodies - possibly for the purpose of recording finer details to be included in the FIR - that noticed the tell-tale signs of how the terrorists had subjected the male victims to the medievalesque, barbaric faith-determination test , by having their lower garments undone, just to establish their faith.Eyewitness accounts have confirmed that the terrorists had checked for faith of each of the victims by asking for their identity proof like Aadhaar card or driving licence, etc, ordering them to recite the kalma (Muslim prayer verse) and asking them to remove their lower clothing so that they could check for circumcision.Once their Hindu identities were established through these 3 'tests', the terrorists shot the victims at close range. Twenty-five of the 26 people killed in Tuesday's attack were Hindus, all of them males.Investigation into the massacre, meanwhile, gathered steam, with sources saying nearly 70 overground workers (OGWs) and known terror sympathisers from various places like Tral, Pulwama, Anantnag and Kulgam are being questioned by a joint team of J&K police, Intelligence Bureau and RAW officials. ""Initially, the probe team rounded up 1,500 OGWs to examine their possible role. These have been narrowed down to 70 OGWs strongly suspected to have helped Pahalgam attack team with logistics. We hope to narrow the search further and get to the real culprits soon,"" a J&K administration officer said.","Trousers of 20 victims pulled down, unzipped or pulled down by officials.

PANAJI: A day after the enforcement directorate (ED) seized property documents worth Rs 600 crore from the offices and residence of 'key mastermind' Rohan Harmalkar , it seized his house. The directorate said that Harmalkar - who contested the 2022 assembly election as an independent - would identify properties that were unattended for many years, and that his clients were mostly from Delhi-NCR and Haryana.Most of the properties Harmalkar identified either had no legal heir, or the owner was deceased or lived abroad without returning to Goa for decades.Once Harmalkar had identified these properties, he along with other accused engaged in impersonation, creation of fake documents, and tampering with revenue records to sell those properties, the central agency said.Harmalkar acted on behalf of some land purchasers so that people from outside Goa could acquire these properties below market price. In some cases, the accused cheated the customers. ""Harmalkar had multiple customers outside the state, including from Delhi-NCR and Haryana, among other places,"" the agency said.On Friday, when the ED searched his office and residences in connection with an alleged land scam , it seized documents of immovable properties worth over Rs 600 crore. The operation also uncovered incriminating property documents worth over Rs 1,000 crore in prime tourist hotspots of North Goa.These included forged title deeds, indicating manipulation of land records and fraudulent transfers of high-value land parcels spanning several lakhs of square meters in places like Anjuna, Arpora, and Assagao in Bardez taluka, the agency said.","Rohan harmalkar's house was seized by the enforcement directorate (ed) on friday.
