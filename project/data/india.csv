"‘In principle’ nod for J&K hydro power project, dam construction to harness Chenab’s potential",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nod-to-divert-forest-land-for-jk-hydel-unit/articleshow/122193994.cms,"NEW DELHI: Acting on the urgency to speed up projects of strategic significance, an environment ministry panel has given “in-principle” approval for diversion of over 847 hectares of reserved forest and ‘jungle-jhari’ land for construction of the ambitious 1,856-MW Sawalkot hydroelectric project in Ramban district of Jammu & Kashmir. Certain key green provisions were set aside for the purpose, keeping in view national interests.Though the final approval will be subject to grant of environment clearance for the project by the UT govt, the move shows the intent to swiftly take up the dam’s construction for leveraging Chenab river’s potential following suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).The Sawalkot hydroelectric project (HEP) is a major hydropower initiative, intended to harness the potential of the Chenab — one of the western rivers along with Indus and Jhelum whose waters currently flow unchecked to Pakistan despite India’s right to use it for non-consumptive purposes, including hydro-power generation.Minutes of the environment ministry’s forest advisory committee meeting, made public this week, show that while giving its approval on June 24, it took note of the Union home ministry’s June 12 plea arguing that conducting cumulative impact assessment (CIA) and carrying capacity studies (CCS) on the Chenab before giving clearance at this juncture “may risk exposure of sensitive hydrological data, which could be exploited by the downstream neighbouring country”.A day before the home ministry’s note to the advisory committee, the power ministry too on June 11 sought granting exemption from CIA and CCS for the Sawalkot HEP for facilitating its expeditious implementation. It argued how conducting CIA and CCS - prerequisite for grant of ‘in-principle’ approval - may leak sensitive hydrological and environmental data, thereby compromising national interests.Earlier, the UT government submitted a similar reply, saying the river Chenab is falling in the Indus Water Treaty and therefore the data of the studies cannot be published due to security reasons.The CIA of a river basin would reflect the cumulative impact of commissioned/ upcoming hydro-power projects on environmental flow, bio-diversity, muck disposal sites and traffic flow in the region etc. whereas the CCS is important to plan optimal number of power projects in a basin.As per the “in-principle” approval of the advisory committee, the forest diversion for the Sawalkot HEP will take place in Udhampur, Reasi and Ramban districts subject to certain specific conditions including dam safety plan, soil and moisture conservation, and the green nod from the UT government.","An environment ministry panel has given “in-principle” approval for diversion of over 847 hectares of reserved forest and ‘jungle-jhari’ land for construction of the ambitious 1,856-mw sawalkot hydroelectric project.

"'Elements of reformation' in Mattoo killer, review remission plea, says HC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/elements-of-reformation-in-mattoo-killer-review-remission-plea-says-hc/articleshow/122193944.cms,"'Singh's conduct, reform can't be ignored'

NEW DELHI: Boosting his chances of securing premature release, Delhi high court Tuesday noted ""demonstrable indicators of reformation"" in Santosh Kumar Singh , convicted in the 1996 rape and murder case of DU law student Priyadarshini Mattoo.Deciding a batch of petitions by murder convicts, including Singh, challenging the rejection of their plea for remission, HC asked the Sentence Review Board (SRB) to consider their applications afresh in next four months.Justice Sanjeev Narula outlined ""an element of reformation"" in Singh and underlined that the nature of the original crime cannot, by itself, be the sole ground for denying premature release.Specifically, in Singh's case, the high court disapproved of SRB's comments that his conduct in jail is not necessarily a barometer of what he may do outside prison.""In the present batch of cases, despite a prima facie reformative conduct and intent exhibited by the convicts, correlation to such material considerations is conspicuously absent,"" the court observed, faulting the SRB for rejecting the plea by Singh and others only due to the gravity, cruelty and perversity of the crime, and the objections raised by police and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).The court found the argument that jail behaviour wasn't an indicator of a person's reformation ""deeply problematic"".""While the heinousness of the offence and the views of investigating agencies are undoubtedly relevant, they cannot operate to the exclusion of other equally material considerations such as post-conviction conduct, demonstrated reform, educational and vocational achievements, and institutional assessment through placement in open prisons,"" the court noted.It pointed out that SRB made ""no effort"" to evaluate the petitioner's ""demonstrable reformative progress, including advanced educational qualifications, documented good conduct and participation in rehabilitation programmes.""Justice Narula also highlighted that Singh was at present lodged in an open prison, which entitles him to exit the prison complex daily between 8am and 8pm for gainful employment as a legal consultant.""As noted above, the placement in such a prison category is a reflection of the positive reformative conduct of the convict. This is a critical indicator of reform which the SRB has failed to even acknowledge, let alone evaluate,"" it observed.In an 82-page verdict, HC detected little indication the SRB ""undertook any nuanced or individualised assessment of the petitioners' present psychological stability and emotional rehabilitation, behavioural disposition, institutional conduct or potential for reintegration. The apparent lack of depth in these foundational reports undermines the deliberative exercise that SRB is expected to undertake. ""The court gave SRB three months to convene its next meeting to consider the plea of Singh and two other convicts.""In doing so, SRB shall ensure due application of mind to each case and make a reasoned decision within a period of four months from the date of this judgment,"" the high court specified, laying down in detail what each official involved in the process must do as per guidelines of the jail manual.It ordered the superintendent of the prison housing the convict to prepare a revised note with a clear recommendation and reflect the official's opinion about the prisoner's conduct, mental and physical health, participation in reformative activities and overall suitability for premature release.Next, a senior police officer of appropriate rank shall prepare a report assessing the convict's conduct, antecedents, present risk profile and community impact in a balanced and evidence-based manner.It further directed that the deputy commissioner of police/superintendent of police concerned must furnish a report as required under relevant rules. Where any objection to premature release is raised, it must be supported by cogent reasons, including any credible threat perception or risk of recidivism.""Mere reiteration of the gravity of the original offence shall not suffice,"" the high court said, adding that inputs from the district probation officer shall also be submitted afresh.""It must be a detailed and individualised inquiry into the desirability of the prisoner's release, addressing, on the basis of relevant material, the convict's family and social background, reintegration prospects, community acceptance and any demonstrated reformation of character or attitude,"" the court noted.It further laid down guidelines for SRB while considering remission pleas of convicts. The board must also conduct psychological assessment of the convicts which was not done in this case, it pointed out.","'singh's conduct, reform can't be ignored' says delhi high court.

SC takes 30 years to implement its own judgment on SC/ST quota,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-takes-30-years-to-implement-its-own-judgment-on-sc/st-quota/articleshow/122193918.cms,"NEW DELHI: More than 30 years after it mandated a 200-point-roster system for earmarking posts for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe candidates in direct recruitments, the Supreme Court has now identified staff posts reserved for SC and ST candidates but provided no quota for OBC candidates.The judgment in R K Sabharwal case was delivered by a five-judge bench on Feb 10, 1995, during the tenure of 26th CJI A M Ahmadi, but it will be implemented now during the tenure of 52nd CJI in Justice B R Gavai, the second Dalit to head judiciary after Justice K G Balakrishnan.CJI Gavai told TOI, “The judgement in Sabharwal case recommended implementation of 200-point roster system for identification of posts for the SC and ST candidates in each category of posts. The identification process is completed and from now onwards vacancies against each reserved post would be filled from the candidates belonging to that category of backward class candidates.”Asked about non-inclusion of OBC quota in direct recruitments, the CJI said, ""I have asked the SC Registry to initiate steps for amendment of the relevant Rules for inclusion of reservation for OBC candidates."" After the Indra Sawhney judgment of 1992, a 27% quota in government jobs was introduced for candidates belonging to OBC communities, but the SC had capped the cumulative reservations at 50% of vacancies.For the 200-point roster system, the SC has enumerated 1280 posts, majority of which comprise junior court attendants (600 posts) and junior court assistants (437). Of the total 1,280 posts, 191 has been earmarked for SC candidates and 93 for STs while the rest 996 posts would be for general category.Since the judgment is of Feb 1995, and the central government circular is of July 1997, it is but natural that there would have been a huge backlog in filling the posts as per the roster system that intends to effectuate 15% and 7.5% quota for SCs and STs respectively.CJI Gavai said, “The backlogs will be gradually filled. This would mean sometimes the reservations in direct recruitments would cross the cumulative 22.5% mark.”In the Sabharwal judgment, a five-judge SC bench led by Justice Kuldip Singh had said, “The only way to assure equality of opportunity to the Backward Classes and the general category is to permit the roster to operate till the time the respective appointees/ promotees occupy the posts meant for them in the roster... As and when there is a vacancy whether permanent or temporary in a particular post the same must be filled from amongst the category to which the post belonged in the roster. ”“The cadre-strength is always measured by the number of posts comprising the cadre… Once the total cadre has full representation of the SCs/STs and Backward Classes in accordance with the reservation policy then the vacancies arising thereafter in the cadre are to be filled from amongst the category of persons to whom the respective vacancies belong,” it had said.",Supreme court has identified staff posts reserved for sc and st candidates. But it provided no quota for obc candidates. The judgment in r k sabharwal case was delivered by a five-judge bench in 1995. It will be implemented now during the tenure of 52nd cji in justice b r gavai.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122193913,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-93498,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

‘Dryer malfunction behind factory blast’

HYDERABAD: The death toll from the massive explosion at a multi-storey chemical plant in Telangana's Medak district climbed to 40 by Tuesday morning, with several workers injured and many still unaccounted for.Rescue operations are ongoing, and officials fear the toll may rise further as teams continue to sift through the rubble in search of those possibly trapped beneath the collapsed building.The government area hospital in Patancheru, where post-mortem examinations are being conducted, confirmed 35 deaths so far.The workers at the plant hail from multiple states, including Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.Following state health minister Damodar Raja Narsimha's directives, health authorities dispatched forensic doctors to the area hospital. The Forensic Science Laboratory is supporting with DNA analysis.Close to 200 personnel from fire services, SDRF, and NDRF teams are conducting rescue operations at the site.The early morning blast reduced the building to rubble at the Rs 500-crore Sigachi Industries facility.Initial findings suggest a dryer malfunction in the quality control unit triggered the blast. “Vice President, operations M E Elanghovan, in charge of attendance, and deputy general manager, M Praveen Kumar are missing. This makes it difficult to determine who was in the building,” a fire official said. Elanghovan had just stepped out of his car when the explosion struck the factory, about 50km from Hyderabad.An adjacent HR block and a rear compound wall were partially damaged. Chunks of cement crushed some workers, while others suffered fatal burns as flames spread rapidly after the blast. Many bodies were burnt beyond recognition. Only four bodies have been identified till late Monday.PM Narendra Modi expressed condolences and announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh each for the families of the deceased and Rs 50,000 for the injured.Distraught relatives waited outside hospitals and at the blast site, hoping for newsas authorities struggled to trace missing workers. “Lack of accurate information from the company management on how many workers were inside has complicated rescue efforts,” director of fire services G V Narayana Rao said. “More could be trapped under the debris. Only once the rubble is cleared will we have a clear picture.”Telangana CM A Revanth Reddy visited the hospital and met victims’ families. He directed the health minister, chief secretary and DGP to oversee rescue and relief efforts.Reddy held a high-level review meeting with concerned officials to assess the situation and ongoing relief efforts.He was briefed on the causes of the accident and the current status of operations. The CM directed officials to conduct inspections across all chemical companies to identify potential safety lapses. He instructed them to submit a comprehensive report, prepared in consultation with experts, highlighting the deficiencies in current safety protocols.To streamline efforts across departments, a special officer will be appointed to oversee coordination during the relief operations.The chief minister ordered immediate financial assistance of Rs 1 lakh to the families of the deceased and Rs 50,000 to those injured, clarifying that this aid is not compensation but urgent support.He also instructed officials to ensure the best medical care for the injured, stating that the government will fully bear the treatment costs if necessary. Furthermore, in a step toward securing the future of affected families, the CM directed that children of the deceased be enrolled in government residential schools, ensuring their continued education and well-being.Sigachi Industries, which manufactures microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), informed stock exchanges about an “accident in the vicinity” of its plant in Medak district.",The death toll from the massive explosion at a multi-storey chemical plant in telangana's medak district climbed to 40 by tuesday morning.

MOHALI: Trouble mounted for dismissed Punjab police DSP Gursher Singh Sandhu as in a fresh development, the vigilance bureau registered a case against him and his mother Sukhwant Kaur for allegedly possessing assets disproportionate to known sources of income.The action stems from a wider probe linked to the controversial interview of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi recorded while he was in custody of Punjab police.According to vigilance officials, DSP Gursher Singh earned approximately Rs 26 lakh over three years, but investigations revealed that he spent around Rs 2.59 crore in the same period — an amount nearly 10 times his official income.The case was registered by the flying squad of Mohali, and multiple raids are underway to apprehend him. However, sources in vigilance bureau suspect that Gursher has fled abroad.This new case adds another layer to legal troubles of the former police officer, who was dismissed from service in Oct 2024 after being booked for fraud, forgery, and corruption. His pre-arrest bail plea was rejected in January this year by a local court, after which he went untraceable.Gursher, known as an ""encounter specialist"" during his tenure with Mohali Police, is facing serious allegations of extortion, land fraud, and abuse of official position.He is accused of buying disputed land parcels at throwaway prices and selling them at inflated rates, as well as filing false complaints through proxies to extort money from victims.One such victim approached the Punjab and Haryana high court, which subsequently ordered the registration of an FIR against him. The case includes charges under Sections 419, 465, 467, 468, and 471 of the IPC, along with provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.Gursher is alleged to have played a key role in facilitating televised interview of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi at the CIA staff office in Kharar. At the time, Gursher was serving as DSP (investigation), Mohali, and was frequently stationed at CIA office in Kharar.The interview caused a political and public uproar, prompting intervention from the high court, which led to his dismissal from service and suspension of seven other police officials. The vigilance bureau has intensified its manhunt for Gursher and is expected to widen its probe into his financial transactions, real estate dealings, and possible overseas links.",Dsp gursher singh sandhu and his mother sukhwant kaur are accused of possessing assets disproportionate to known sources of income.

BENGALURU: Central Administrative Tribunal Tuesday quashed the suspension order of senior IPS officer Vikash Kumar Vikash and held Royal Challengers Bengaluru responsible for the ""unexpected congregation"" outside Chinnaswamy Stadium, which led to the death of 11 fans on June 4.CM Siddaramaiah said there's scope for appealing against the order, indicating the government would pursue legal options.Also read: Bengaluru stampede: Tribunal says police not 'Aladdin ka Chirag'; blames RCB for chaos Following the stampede and public outcry, state govt had on June 5 suspended Vikash (inspector general & additional commissioner of police, west, Bengaluru City) and four other officials, including Bengaluru (City) police commissioner B Dayananda.CAT, a quasi-judicial body that redresses officers' grievances, said govt passed the suspension order in ""a mechanical manner"" and added that police personnel were only human and not 'bhagwan' or 'magicians'The tribunal observed that due to RCB inviting people through social media posts, ""3 to 5 lakh people"" gathered outside the stadium, which has a capacity of 35,000. Prima facie, it appeared RCB was responsible for the gathering of lakhs of people without seeking permission or consent from police. ""Due to shortage of time on June 4, police were unable to make appropriate arrangements. Sufficient time was not given to police,"" a CAT bench comprising judicial member Justice B K Shrivastava and administrative member Santhosh Mehra observed.Also read: RCB 'prima facie responsible' for June 4 stampede; no police permission taken, says Tribunal CAT said police personnel are human and not 'bhagwan' or 'magicians' with powers akin to 'Aladdin ka chirag' (Aladdin's magic lamp).To control such a gathering and make proper arrangements, sufficient time should be given to the police, the tribunal noted, while quashing Vikash's suspension order.On June 9, Vikash had moved CAT, citing that no fault could be attributed to him since the suspension order itself showed a lack of time to prepare for a huge event. He further added that the order was issued without a show-cause notice and contended that suspension is an extreme measure imposed in cases of grave misconduct.Also read: Suspension of IPS officer Vikash Kumar Vikash revoked; tribunal urges review of action against others officers State govt had said, as per police manual, the primary duty of the police is to prevent crime.

The tribunal noted that KSCA had submitted only a letter, which didn't contain any request seeking permission or for making arrangements. Therefore, it was not expected that police would make all arrangements suddenly. At the time of passing the order, there was no material suggesting negligence of the police officers concerned, CAT said.","Rcb invite drew '3-5l people' to b'luru stadium, says tribunal.

NEW DELHI: In a disturbing detail that has emerged from the gangrape case at South Calcutta Law College, police said CCTV footage confirmed that one of the accused, Zaib Ahmed, left the crime scene briefly to buy an inhaler for the victim. He went to a medical store to buy inhaler after she pleaded for relief from breathlessness during the alleged assault.According to investigators, the footage from a nearby medical shop showed Zaib purchasing the inhaler at the victim's request, following her deteriorating condition inside the security guard’s room where the assault took place on the evening of June 25.“The victim said she had begged for medical help after falling ill during the torture. The accused denied taking her to a hospital but did get her an inhaler from a pharmacy. She felt better temporarily, but the torture continued,” a senior officer told news agency PTI.The pharmacy owner told police that Zaib attempted to split the payment, partly in cash and partly through UPI, but eventually paid the full amount online. Investigators have documented the transaction and matched it with the time of the assault.Meanwhile, medical reports have revealed fresh nail scratch marks on the body of the prime accused, Monojit Mishra, indicating the victim put up resistance during the attack. “Such injuries are consistent with a struggle,” a police source told PTI.The Special Investigation Team (SIT) has uncovered that Monojit contacted the college's vice principal, Dr Nayna Chatterji, the morning after the incident. The two have since been questioned regarding their conversation.Investigators are also questioning 16 individuals, mostly students, seen in the college premises via CCTV footage after class hours on June 25. Six were interrogated on Tuesday.Kolkata police commissioner Manoj Verma confirmed that digital, circumstantial, and medical evidence gathered so far aligns with the victim’s official complaint. “The matter is extremely sensitive.

HYDERABAD: Death toll in the explosion at Sigachi Industries' multi-storey pharma plant in Telangana's Pashamylaram climbed to 36 by Tuesday evening as rescue teams pulled burnt bodies from the collapsed structure. DNA profiling is underway to identify the severely burnt victims, with 15 still unaccounted for.Police charged Sigachi's management for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, grievous hurt, and attempted murder under BNS, acting on a complaint by Rajanala Sai Yashwanth, son of a deceased worker. His father, a long-time employee, and other workers had repeatedly warned management about ageing machinery, Yashwanth said. ""This was not an accident - it was waiting to happen.""The Rs 500-crore facility operated without a fire department NOC. Fire officials said the plant lacked basic safety systems - no fire alarms, heat sensors, automatic shutdowns. There were no blast-resistant walls or roofs in processing zones that handled microcrystalline cellulose - an inflammable material prone to static electricity. No third-party safety audits were conducted in recent years.A criminal probe is underway, and arrests are likely after forensic and official reports are submitted. The explosion, triggered around 9.20am Monday by a suspected dryer malfunction in the quality control unit, occurred two hours after over 60 workers reported for duty. At the time, 143 employees were on-site. One of the 35 injured died at a private hospital.Authorities said 58 survivors have been located.

"CEC: Vote should be where you live, not ‘native’ place",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cec-vote-should-be-where-you-live-not-native-place/articleshow/122191668.cms,"NEW DELHI: The special intensive revision of electoral roll in Bihar and eventually, rest of country, will not only exclude persons added as electors after 2003-04, on grounds of non-submission of documents to prove their Indian citizenship but also outmigrants who have avoided being registered as electors in the constituency where they are ordinarily resident, only to retain their vote in their “native” place and state or where they own a house.Confirming this, chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar told TOI, “As per Representation of the People Act (R P Act), you are entitled to vote only in the assembly constituency where you are an ordinary resident. For example, if you ordinarily reside in Delhi but own a house in Patna, your vote should be registered in Delhi, not in Patna”.According to Section 19 of the R P Act, 1950, every person who is not less than 18 years of age and ordinarily resident in a constituency shall be entitled to be registered in the electoral roll of that constituency. Section 20 goes on to explain the meaning of ‘ordinarily resident’, saying that a person shall not be deemed to be ordinarily resident on the ground only that he owns or is in possession of a dwelling house therein. It adds that a person absenting himself temporarily from his place of ordinary residence shall not, by reason thereof, cease to be ordinarily resident therein.It is a well-known practice in many states where outmigration is high, for instance, Bihar and UP, for migrants to retain their vote in their native village or town where their house or land is located, rather than shift their vote to a far-off place or state, say Maharashtra or Delhi, despite having ordinarily resident for long enough, by virtue of working there of having relocated there due to family member/s staying or working there.“Some of these migrants have been living away from their native places or where they own a house for years, but travel back during an election to vote in their home constituency. In fact, some political parties even pay for their travel to their native place to secure votes,” said an EC functionary.SIR in Bihar is aimed at putting an end to this trend, which is a violation of the laid down law. “An elector must choose the MLA or MP of the constituency where he is ordinarily resident and which is where he lives and works,” explained the functionary.","The special intensive revision of electoral roll in bihar and eventually, rest of country will not only exclude persons added as electors after 2003-04.

NEW DELHI: The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) on Tuesday observed that, prima facie, the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) appeared to be responsible for the stampede that took place in Bengaluru on June 4. The tribunal observed that the police cannot be expected to make all necessary arrangements within just 12 hours, noting that they do not possess ""magical powers like Aladdin's lamp.""The tribunal criticised the IPL franchise for announcing their victory celebrations without police clearance, triggering a crowd surge that killed 11 people and injured dozens more outside M Chinnaswamy Stadium.""Prima facie it appears that the RCB (Royal Challengers Bengaluru) is responsible for the gathering of about three to five lakh people. The RCB did not take the appropriate permission or consent from the Police. Suddenly, they posted on social media platforms and as a result of aforesaid information the public were gathered. Because of shortage of time on 04.06.2026, the Police was unable to do the appropriate arrangements.

Vikash had challenged the June 5 order, which also named then Bengaluru Police Commissioner B Dayananda and DCP Shekar H Tekkannavar.The Bengaluru bench delivered its verdict on Tuesday. Chief minister Siddaramaiah responded, saying that the government has the option to appeal the CAT ruling.The suspension of Vikash and other senior officers by the Karnataka government came under intense scrutiny after reports suggested that RCB and event organisers bypassed standard protocols. The government had claimed that while RCB CEO had sent an intimation to the Police Commissioner on June 3, no formal approval was granted.The Karnataka government has also issued new Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for managing crowds at events and mass gatherings. According to the SOPs released by the Office of the Director General and Inspector General of Police, “Police responses must prioritise life safety, protection of rights, prevention of property damage, and de-escalation of potential conflicts.”The guidelines recognise that “modern gatherings are often spontaneous and influenced by social media, necessitating adaptive strategies.” They stress the importance of “early planning, coordination with stakeholders, and minimal use of force” as essential principles for effective crowd management.The SOPs cover all types of public events, from festivals and rallies to sports celebrations, providing a strategic framework to ensure public safety while maintaining law and order. Pre-event preparation includes “conducting behavioural and spatial analysis” to identify risks and bottlenecks, along with rigorous venue safety audits. Notably, venues that fail to meet safety standards, including capacity limits and evacuation plans, “must not be approved for high-footfall events. ”In wake of the Bengaluru stampede, a criminal case was registered against RCB officials, the KSCA, and DNA Entertainment. Several event organisers were arrested but later granted interim bail.Meanwhile, the Karnataka high court continues to hear a suo motu case into the tragedy.

Cardiologists divided

Public urged not to ignore warning signs

NEW DELHI: A wave of sudden cardiac deaths in Karnataka, especially among young people, has jolted the state government into action, with chief minister Siddaramaiah announcing a 10-day deadline for an expert panel to submit its findings. In the past month alone, at least 20 people in Hassan district have reportedly died of heart attacks, many without prior symptoms or pre-existing conditions.Leading the probe is Dr KS Ravindranath, Director of Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, who is working in coordination with the Hassan Institute of Medical Sciences (HIMS) to identify patterns, possible causes, and preventive measures.“Fourteen of the deceased died at home without seeking medical help. Nine were under 30,” said Dr Rajanna B, director of HIMS, confirming that the deaths occurred between May 28 and June 28, 2025.With many cases too old for post-mortems, investigators are depending on local doctors, family testimonies, and patient records. The deaths have sparked concern across the state, with Jayadeva hospitals in Bengaluru and Mysuru reporting a 20% rise in emergency cardiac OPD visits.In a statement on Tuesday, CM Siddaramaiah did not rule out the possibility that Covid-19 vaccines may have contributed to some of the deaths. “We cannot ignore that the hasty approval and distribution of the vaccine could also be a factor, as global studies have hinted at links to cardiac issues,” he said. He added that the same expert committee had been asked in February to study post-vaccination effects and young adult deaths statewide.“Before BJP criticizes us, they should ask their conscience,” Siddaramaiah remarked, accusing opposition leaders of politicizing a public health concern.The medical fraternity appears split on the issue. While the Mysuru chapter of the Cardiological Society of India (CSI) has launched a separate two-year study into rising cardiac cases among youth, led by Dr Shashirekha and Dr Veena Nanjappa, senior cardiologist and MP Dr CN Manjunath downplayed the trend as new.“This is not a sudden phenomenon,” said Dr Manjunath, who cited a 2013–2018 study of 5,000 heart attack patients aged 20–45. “We found 50% were smokers, and nearly 20% had diabetes or high BP. But worryingly, 25% had no conventional risk factors. We need to examine food safety and pesticide exposure too.”While the debate continues, the government is urging citizens not to delay seeking help. “Anyone with chest pain or breathing issues must go to the nearest health centre immediately,” said Siddaramaiah. He cited state-run health programs like Hridaya Jyothi and Gruha Arogya as part of efforts to monitor and respond to rising cardiac risk.The expert committee’s report is expected by July 10.",At least 20 people in hassan district have reportedly died of heart attacks in the past month.

And what's of even greater concern, despite greater access to higher education, a staggering 88% of India's workforce remains engaged in low-competency occupations, a report by Institute for Competitiveness, India's affiliate of Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness at Harvard Business School, has said.The crisis is compounded by regional disparities - states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh lag on high-skill job shares, while UTs and states, such as Chandigarh, Puducherry, Goa, and Kerala lead in better utilisation of skilled professionals.The report, ""Skills for the Future: Transforming India's Workforce Landscape"", used Periodic Labour Force Survey data from 2017-18 to 2023-24. It found only 8.25% of graduates (Educational Skill Level 3) are in roles matching their qualifications, while more than half work lower-skill jobs. As much as 88% of the workforce is engaged in low-skill (Skill Level 1 and 2) jobs, such as street vending, domestic work, and manual operations, even as enrolment in education and vocational training has risen.The ""Mismatch Table"" in the report, released by Jayant Chaudhary, minister of skill development and entrepreneurship, revealed that over 50% of graduates are employed in roles like clerks, machine operators, and sales workers (Skill Level 2).While 38.23% of graduates are in Skill Level 4 jobs, 28.12% of postgraduates are in mid-skill occupations, pointing to underutilised talent. It also noted many underqualified cases - workers lacking formal education for higher-skill jobs - were likely compensated by informal training or Technical and Vocational Education and Training .These patterns expose structural inefficiencies in labour market. And they are reflected in wage trends. Skill Level 1 workers earn minimum wages. Those at Skill Level 2 have seen 5-6% annual wage growth, while Skill Level 3 and 4 professionals saw 8-12% growth, reinforcing the need to move more workers into high-competency roles.

"Insurance scam: Officials from 50 firms, finance ministry meet in Sambhal to plug gaps leading to frauds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/insuring-dying-dead-50-firms-finmin-meet-with-senior-cops/articleshow/122193252.cms,"Insurance scam: Officials from 50 firms, finance ministry meet in Sambhal to plug gaps leading to frauds

MEERUT: Six months after a multi-crore insurance scam surfaced in Uttar Pradesh’s Sambhal district, senior officials from the Union finance ministry, insurance regulatory bodies, over 50 insurance companies, and investigative agencies met in Sambhal to plug critical policy gaps and improve coordination. At the conclave hosted by the UP Police, officials proposed systemic reforms to combat insurance fraud, including changes to Section 45, enhanced data sharing, and stricter scrutiny of investigation processes.The scam, first reported by TOI, involved policies being taken out in the names of terminally ill or deceased individuals across more than 12 states. ""The findings uncovered during the probe prompted the need for a national-level dialogue on fraud prevention. The idea came from the case details we encountered over the past six months,” said Anukriti Sharma, additional SP of Sambhal and lead investigator.The investigation revealed that the network did not stop at forgery. In some cases, operatives allegedly resorted to murder to access insurance payouts. Four such deaths, initially reported as accidents, were later linked directly to the scam. In one case, a paralysed man was killed in Sambhal for a policy worth Rs 95 lakh.In another, a man was murdered in Amroha to claim Rs 2.7 crore. These killings highlighted the organised nature of the racket and its readiness to escalate from document fraud to homicide.Sambhal SP Krishna Bishnoi said the conclave concluded with a range of key suggestions. “We discussed better coordination among insurers, the need to relook Section 45, investor protection, standardisation of investigation procedures, and stronger communication between police and insurance firms,” he told TOI. He added that participants also suggested introducing new legislation tailored to insurance fraud, setting standards for investigation companies, and building structured channels for information-sharing between stakeholders.The scale of the fraud brought Section 45 of the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Act, 2015, into sharp focus. The clause bars insurers from questioning a policy on any ground—including misstatement or fraud—after three years from the date of issuance, revival or commencement, whichever is earlier. Officials said this clause has often been misused to push fraudulent claims.At the conclave, Meena Kumari, Executive Director of IRDAI, pointed out that insurers need to maintain up-to-date policies and procedures at both the underwriting stage and the claims stage, with an appropriate feedback loop. Many companies appear to be missing early signs of fraud because the systems don’t talk to each other,” she said. “Preventing fraud is essential, but equal attention must be paid to ensuring no genuine claim is denied. ” She called for smarter use of data and faster detection tools that don’t delay payouts to honest claimants.Mandakini Balodhi, director (insurance), the finance ministry, said the bigger challenge was the restoration of public trust. “Insurance is a tool of financial inclusion, and social security schemes allow us to serve the most vulnerable. Fraud and abuse in the insurance ecosystem hit these highly vulnerable segments and need to be arrested by concerted efforts of all present in the ecosystem, insurance and outside. ” She added that repeated frauds risk damaging faith in welfare programmes designed for the most vulnerable.Venkat Changavalli, who leads the Insurance Information Bureau, said fraudsters were exploiting the gaps between companies. “We see the same scam patterns being missed because insurers aren’t sharing data fast enough,” he said. “We’re working on systems to flag suspicious claims in real time, but that only works if insurers respond quickly and consistently.”TOI’s investigation revealed that the scam, estimated to be worth over Rs 500 crore, extended into government-backed schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana and Mukhyamantri Sadak Durghatna Bima Yojana. Operatives used fake death certificates, tampered Aadhaar data, and backdated policies to make fraudulent claims. The investigation exposed links between insurance agents, hospital staff, bank officials, ASHA workers, civic employees, and elected representatives.In Jan, UP Police intercepted an SUV in Sambhal carrying cash, forged PAN cards, Aadhaar details, and fake documents. That bust triggered a wider investigation and culminated in a May case by the Enforcement Directorate under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Police later filed an 800-page chargesheet naming operatives from UP, Bihar, and Jharkhand. Police have so far registered 17 FIRs in Sambhal, Moradabad, Badaun and Amroha, arrested 52 people, and recorded three surrenders.","Officials from 50 firms, finance ministry meet in sambhal to plug gaps leading to frauds.
