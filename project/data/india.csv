NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to frame a comprehensive guideline on organ transplant to enable the poor and marginalised equal access to these life-saving surgical procedures and sought joint suggestions from govt and the petitioner.Appearing for the petitioner, senior advocate K Parameshwar told a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran there must be a national organ availability data grid to enable the prospective recipients in queue to know where they stand and the chance of them getting a transplant. A state-wide waitlist of recipients must be prepared, he said.Parameshwar said people belonging to poor and marginalised sections of society do not stand a chance to get organ transplants as 90% of hospitals and clinics, accredited to carry out the surgical procedures, are in the private sector, which is accessible only to the rich and influential.He said SC must direct the Centre and states to establish at least one hospital in each state and UT to enable poor patients to avail organ transplant surgery at an affordable cost. He also flagged the skewed gender ratio among organ donors as majority of donors were women, though majority of men were recipients.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta agreed to the petitioner's suggestions, but said there should be two regimes - one for normal donors, and the other for cases where organs are harvested from those dying in accidents.Justice Chandran said in the south there were many cases of ""motivated accidents"" to enable harvesting of organs for an interested recipient. ""It happens mostly on highways, I am told. A film was made in Kerala on this issue, and the script was written by a serving police officer who probably knew about this scam,"" he said.Mehta termed them shocking cases of murder. The CJI-led bench asked Mehta, additional solicitor general Archana D Pathak and Parameshwar to draft the common points to be included in the order and place it before the court on Wednesday.","Supreme court agrees to frame a comprehensive guideline on organ transplant to enable the poor and marginalised equal access to these life-saving surgical procedures.

NIA courts

must be set up with proper infra: SC

NEW DELHI The Supreme Court has said the Centre, along with the judiciary, must devise a plan to complete trials in NIA cases within six months to prevent ""hue and cry"" over prolonged bail denial.A bench of CJI-designate Surya Kant and Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and N K Singh said on Tuesday, ""We want a system committed for expeditious completion of trials, preferably in six months, so that a hue and cry over non-grant of bail (for long periods to accused) is not raised, especially in cases involving crimes against nation and public at large.""For this, dedicated NIA courts must be established with proper infrastructure, including wi-fi services, to enable appearance of accused through virtual mode and prevent unnecessary adjournments, Justice Kant said after additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati handed over a status report framed by ministry of home affairs on setting up of exclusive NIA courts. After studying the status report, the bench commended the initiative but said the process must be expedited. It told Bhati that a firm decision on the proposed plan of action must be taken on or before Dec 16, the next date of hearing.Justice Kant also told Delhi HC not to saddle the exclusive NIA courts with regular cases. The HC informed the SC that there are 50 NIA cases pending in Delhi, two in Karkardooma courts and 48 at Patiala House courts.Additional solicitor general S D Sanjay told the court that the govt is planning to set up 10-12 exclusive courts but finding space for them immediately has been difficult. The bench said the authorities must explore govt buildings for temporary accommodation of the courts till a permanent building is constructed for them.","Nia courts must be established with proper infrastructure, including wi-fi services, says cji-designate surya kant.

SC: Justice Bhuyan criticises ruling; CJI Gavai refuses to give rejoinder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-justice-bhuyan-criticises-ruling-cji-gavai-refuses-to-give-rejoinder/articleshow/125423844.cms,"'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: While dissenting with CJI B R Gavai on the court's recall of the May 16 judgment of the SC authored by Justices A S Oka and him directing demolition of all structures which were granted post-facto environmental clearance, Justice Ujjal Bhuyan trained his criticism on the CJI and said the majority opinion of the court had overlooked the very fundamentals of environment jurisprudence.It was natural of Justice Bhuyan, who was part of the bench that penned the May 16 judgment, to defend the sanctity of that verdict in the face of many errors pointed out by CJI. But his statement that the CJI's judgment was ""an innocent expression of opinion"" overlooking fundamentals of environment jurisprudence raised many eyebrows, as it is widely known that Justice Gavai, as head of the green bench, has passed many judgments for the protection of environment and forests while advocating the concept of 'sustainable development'.In his 97-page counter to the CJI's 84-page recall judgment, Justice Bhuyan said, ""Precautionary principle is the cornerstone of environmental jurisprudence. 'Polluter pays' is only a principle of reparation. Precautionary principle cannot be given a short shrift by relying on the polluter pays principle. The review judgment is a step in retrogression.""After pronouncing his judgment, CJI Gavai recalled that there was a precedent in Court room no.1 for a dissenting judgment to criticise that of the CJI and the CJI responding to the dissenting view (as happened between Justice S R Bhat and CJI D Y Chandrachud in the same-sex marriage issue).""I am departing from tradition. I have not changed a single word in my judgment even after receiving the dissenting judgment (of Justice Bhuyan),"" CJI Gavai said.When Justice Bhuyan skipped reading paragraphs in his judgment criticising the CJI's view and said he ""didn't want to read certain undercurrents"", Justice Gavai encouraged him to read it and said, ""Anyway this would be in public domain. So read it.""But Justice Bhuyan was not persuaded.Justice K Vinod Chandran said he had written a separate judgment concurring with CJI only because ""the (Justice Bhuyan's) opinion rejecting the review denounces the one permitting it."" Justice Chandran said dissent is part of a healthy judicial process, but it must be practised by distancing oneself from an overbearing allegiance to one's own beliefs of right and wrong.Giving a step-by-step counter to Justice Bhuyan's judgment, Justice Chandran said, ""The judgment under review, with due respect did not look into the aspects of the power conferred under the Environment Protection Act and the legal principles regarding an undertaking given in derogation of the statutory provisions.""He added, ""I fully concur with the opinion of the Learned Chief Justice of India and find the review to be not only warranted, but imperative and expedient.""","Justice ujjal bhuyan trained his criticism on the cji and said the majority opinion of the court had overlooked the very fundamentals of environment jurisprudence.

Hidma's death may help forces end Naxalism by Amit Shah deadline,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hidmas-death-may-help-forces-end-naxalism-by-amit-shah-deadline/articleshow/125423773.cms,"The Ghost Of Bastar Falls: What Madvi Hidma’s Death Means For India’s War Against Maoist Insurgency

Was he ready to surrender when he was shot?

NEW DELHI: The neutralisation of Madvi Hidma, the youngest CPI (Maoist) central committee member and yet its most dreaded military commander, came 12 days ahead of the Nov 30, 2025 deadline set by home minister Amit Shah for the counter-Naxal forces to end his terror run. Hidma's exit may have brought the security establishment realistically close to achieving the March 31, 2026 goal set by home minister Amit Shah for eliminating left-wing extremist violence from the country.As on date, the CPI (Maoist) central committee's strength stands eroded to seven, including the three politburo members Thippiri Tirupathi alias Devji, Muppalla Laxman Rao alias Ganpathy and Misir Besra. Ganapathy is in his seventies and Misir Besra confined to a small area in Jharkhand with little cadre strength. The remaining four 'active' CC members are Ganesh Uikey, Anal Da, Malla Raji Reddy alias Sangram and Ramder.Sources told TOI that after Shah declared last year that Naxalism shall be uprooted by March 31, 2026, he has been giving the security forces mini-goals or milestones to be achieved along the way. These milestones could be freeing a certain area from Maoists' hold or tackling the top CPI (Maoist) leadership by getting them to surrender or, where unwilling, neutralising them in intelligence-based operations. Sources said Shah, while chairing recent reviews on left-wing extremism, had directed the forces to neutralise Hidma latest by Nov 30.Hidma, who had commanded the dreaded Battalion No 1 of the Peoples' Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) before passing on the baton to Barse Deva, was the only Bastar tribal to be anointed to CC.The forces had been on his trail for years but Hidma remained elusive. Though Chhattisgarh deputy CM Vijay Sharma had on Nov 10 approached Hidma's mother to appeal to him to surrender, he did not respond.The killing of Hidma, given how crucial he was to CPI (Maoist)'s operational capabilities, ""is a historic milestone in the fight against left wing extremism,"" IG, Bastar Range Sundarraj P told TOI. He said the remaining Maoist leaders of concern are Devji, Sangram, Ganesh Uikey, Ramder as well as Barse Deva and Pappa Rao. The assessment is that no more than 100-150 uniformed, armed, full-time Maoist cadres may be active, possibly in the National Park area, Gariyaband or inter-state borders of Chhattisgarh-Telangana and Andhra-Odisha. ""Some may surrender after Hidma's killing. But those who don't, shall be confronted by the security forces,"" he said.The year 2025 has dealt a debilitating blow to the Maoists, with many top leaders killed or having surrendered. The most prominent PB leader to be eliminated was general secretary Nambala Keshav Rao, while Mallujola Venugopal Rao alias Sonu surrendered. The CC members neutralised this year include Kadari Satyanarayan Reddy, Katta Ramchandra Reddy, Chalapati, Gajrala Ravi, Vivek Chandri Yadav and Thentu Laxmi. Other CC members who surrendered are Sujata, Chandranna and Rupesh.Telangana cops said Hidma had dropped enough hints about a possible surrender and they were working on it. Chhattisgarh deputy CM Vijay Sharma had met his mother, after which she strongly urged Hidma to give up arms. A Bastar journalist said Hidma wrote to him last week that he was considering surrender and sought help to negotiate with the govt.","Madvi hidma was the youngest cpi (maoist) central committee member and yet its most dreaded military commander.

Bengaluru Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know.

BENGALURU: Metro services on the Yellow Line were disrupted for over 30 minutes Monday morning after a group of passengers halted a train at RV Road station, demanding that BMRCL start operations at 5am on the newly opened corridor.The incident occurred at 6am, when 10-15 commuters allegedly stood between the doors of a departing train, preventing them from closing and allowing the train to leave the station.Based on a complaint from BMRCL, an FIR was registered against unidentified passengers for obstructing services. While operations on Purple and Green Lines begin around 4.30am Mondays, Yellow Line — connecting RV Road to Bommasandra — currently starts its first service at 6am.Officials said this mismatch left early officer-goers frustrated and airport-bound commuters waiting at RV Road station. When train ID02 arrived at 5.55am, a group of passengers is said to have confronted staff, questioning why the service hadn't commenced earlier. Despite explanations that Yellow Line services cannot operate before 6am due to limited availability of trainsets, passengers continued to argue.Instead of boarding, they stood between the coach doors, preventing them from closing each time the loco pilot attempted to start the train. This led to a cascading delay of nearly 35 minutes, affecting subsequent schedules and inconveniencing hundreds of passengers during early-morning rush.A senior official said BMRCL is currently operating Yellow Line with all available trainsets, leaving no spare rakes to be deployed for earlier services. ""Passengers disrupted operations, causing delays across multiple trains. We had to call police to resolve the situation,"" the official said.Later to make up for the disruption, BMRCL ran a short-loop service up to Silk Board.In an official release, the corporation warned that obstructing Metro operations is a punishable offence under Metro Railway (Operation and Maintenance) Act, 2002, and could attract imprisonment, fines, or both. ""Such actions compromise safety and inconvenience thousands,"" the statement read.It also highlighted recent improvements since Nov 1 — after adding the fifth trainset, Yellow Line start time was advanced from 6:30am to 6am, and peak-hour headway was reduced from 19 minutes to 15. More improvements are expected as additional trains are inducted into the service, it said.","Metro services on the yellow line were disrupted for over 30 minutes monday morning.

The Culmination

The painful truths

Investigative systems can fail, especially when constrained by corruption, negligence, or lack of urgency.

Evidence matters, but how it's collected — and whether due process is followed — can make or break a case.

Confession is a double-edged sword: powerful, but only if obtained fairly and documented properly.

NOIDA/NEW DELHI: For years, the narrow lanes of Nithari whispered the same story: children vanished, one after another, swallowed by a darkness no one could name.Inside D-5, where life seemed ordinary from the outside, investigators later uncovered fragments of a nightmare scattered through drains, courtyards and rooms that refused to give up their truth.Two decades on, Nithari remains less a crime scene and more a wound — a place where every unanswered question still walks the streets.The Nithari case remains one of country's most chilling and controversial serial-killing episodes. It centers around Bungalow D-5 in Nithari village, Noida and involves two men — the homeowner, Moninder Singh Pandher and his domestic helper, Surinder Koli The macabre tale that unfolded over years involved skeletal remains in drains, allegations of rape, murder, necrophilia, and organ trading — and a deeply flawed investigation that has haunted the judicial process for nearly two decades.The nightmare began in May 2006, when Nand Lal , father of a 22-year-old woman named Payal (also known as Deepika), reported her missing.Payal had visited Pandher’s bungalow D-5 in Sector 31, Nithari, allegedly to talk about a job for her brother — but she never returned.It was later reported that Koli had called her from a public phone booth.Despite the serious nature of the disappearance, the police response was strikingly delayed.According to a former investigator (then sub-inspector, later DSP), no FIR was registered for months.It was only after a court application under Section 156(3) of the CrPC, filed by Nand Lal, that an FIR was formally lodged on October 7, 2006 — nearly five months after Payal vanished.Things took a horrifying turn on December 29, 2006, when investigators discovered eight skeletal remains in a roadside drain next to the D-5 bungalow.This grim find, lead to the arrest of both Koli and Pandher. Within days, more bone fragments were unearthed in and around the drainage system.The discovery shook the nation and exposed the full extent of what had been a series of missing persons — children and young women — in and around Nithari.The initial investigation by the Uttar Pradesh Police came under criticism almost immediately. According to the first investigator, crucial delays had allowed the case to spiral: The FIR was filed only after months of pressure, and formal search operations began six months too late.These early lapses, he said, sowed the seeds of deeper problems.By January 10, 2007, due to mounting public outrage and the scale of the horror, the case was handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Within days, CBI teams conducted intensive searches around the bungalow and adjoining areas, recovering more human remains — skulls, bone pieces and dismembered body parts.The sheer scale of recovered remains made it difficult even for the investigators to determine how many victims there might have been.In the early months of the investigation, charge sheets were filed in 16 cases, spanning accusations of murder, rape, abduction, criminal conspiracy, destruction of evidence and more.On March 1, 2007, Koli made a highly detailed recorded confession.He reportedly admitted to murdering six children and one woman. He described luring them into the bungalow, strangling them, sexually abusing the bodies, dismembering them and discarding the remains in drains.He also made claims of cannibalism, stating that he sometimes cooked and ate flesh from the victims.The case proceeded in a special CBI court in Ghaziabad, and on February 13, 2009, both Koli and Pandher were sentenced to death in the first case.The trial court would go on to deliver verdicts over many years, across multiple hearings, more than 2,000 hearings were held during this prolonged trial.Koli was eventually convicted in 13 cases by the trial court and awarded death sentences in all, though one of these was commuted to life imprisonment.In a later case (May 2022), a special CBI court awarded him another death sentence for the rape and murder of a woman.While the trial court’s judgments were gruesome and seemed to close the case, the story was far from over.On September 11, 2009, the Allahabad high court delivered a big verdict: While upholding Koli’s death sentence, it acquitted Pandher in at least one prominent case, citing “no evidence” against him.Over time, Koli’s legal team mounted a fierce appeal. On October 16, 2023, in a landmark decision, the Allahabad high court acquitted Koli in 12 of the death-sentence cases and Pandher in two, overturning the trial court’s verdicts.The court did not mince words: It stated that the investigation had been botched up and that “basic norms of collecting evidence were brazenly violated.”A particularly scathing point in the high court’s judgment was the failure to probe possible organ trade — an angle raised by a high-level committee from the Ministry of Women and Child Development.Investigators, the court said, “opted for the easy course” by pinning blame on Koli and demonising him, instead of exploring deeper and more alarming conspiracies.The court also questioned the credibility of Koli’s confession. It noted procedural irregularities: the confession was allegedly recorded 60 days into police remand, yet there was no medical examination or independent witness.Moreover, the court highlighted contradictions in prosecution testimony about where and when the confession was made.Recovery of skeletal remains, according to the court, came from a drain outside the boundaries of Pandher’s house — not from inside, as had often been claimed.Ultimately, the court declared that the guilt of Koli and Pandher had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, particularly because the case rested largely on circumstantial evidence.The judgment drew sharp criticism from victim families, who saw it as a deep betrayal after nearly two decades of pursuing justice.Following the high court’s 2023 acquittal, Moninder Singh Pandher was released from Luksar Jail on October 20, 2023, after spending 14 years behind bars.Surinder Koli, meanwhile, was not immediately freed — he continued to serve a life sentence in a separate conviction.But his legal fight was not over.In July 2025, the Supreme Court upheld the Allahabad HC’s acquittal of Koli in the 12 previously overturned cases. The apex court ruled that police lapses had rendered crucial evidence inadmissible.Then, on November 11, 2025, in a decisive moment, the Supreme Court accepted Koli’s curative plea (his last judicial recourse), acquitted him in the final pending case (Rimpa Haldar case) and ordered his immediate release.The man once dubbed the “Nithari killer” has now been acquitted in all major Nithari murder cases.When word of his acquittal reached his barrack, Koli had remained seated for some time, staring at the floor. Then a faint smile crossed his face. “He was relaxed, and there was a smile on his face,” a senior jail official told TOI.While Koli did give a detailed confession, the courts later scrutinised the conditions of its recording, It came long into police custody, without independent witnesses, and with no medical examination — casting shadows on its voluntariness and authenticity.Perhaps most damning was the court’s assertion that organ trade – a horrifying, but plausible, motive – was not properly probed.The investigation, according to the HC, seemed to choose the less difficult path of blaming a single man rather than confronting possible organised crime.One sacked officer, Simranjeet Kaur was arrested by the CBI in 2007 for allegedly framing false records to protect Pandher and Koli, having received payments.The mysterious death of a key witness, Jatin Sarkar, whose daughter was among the missing. His body was later found in a pond in Bengal.Parents of missing children watched as time passed with no clear answers. The high court’s 2023 acquittals were met with “dejection” by many, signaling that legal closure did not equal emotional closure.The community around Nithari, once traumatised by the gruesome revelations, still remembers the D-5 bungalow as a somber landmark.The Supreme Court’s acquittal in the 13th, and final, case against Koli left the families devastated.A 63-year-old Jhabbu Lal and his wife Sunita (60) continued seeking justice for their daughter Jyoti — one of the children who went missing in 2006 and was later found among the Nithari victims.“I had six children, and the fifth was Jyoti. She went missing in 2006,” Lal recalled, his voice shaking. “Her body was later found in the drain outside house number D5 (Moninder Pandher's bungalow where Koli worked).”Lal spent decades fighting in courts, selling valuables and even a house in Sangam Vihar, Delhi, to fund the case.Lal said, “If he didn’t commit the crime, then who did? If he is freed, that means someone else killed our children. Why was Koli kept behind bars for so many years?”Sunita Lal added, “Even after all these years, the pain hasn’t faded. Every time I pass that bungalow, it feels like I’m standing at the same place where my world ended. We never got our child back — only the memories and a lifetime of waiting for justice.”Another mother of a deceased said ""Moninder (Moninder Singh Pandher) and Surinder Koli, killed so many children. But the case is not being done anything about. Who is guilty now? Was there a ghost in that house which killed all children? They used to kill children and indulge in organ trafficking. Now they say that they are innocent. Law is letting them go; God won't.""When the Supreme Court finally granted his curative petition in November 2025 and ordered his immediate release, it marked the end of a long, fraught journey.The ruling underscored deep flaws in the original investigation: procedural lapses, contested confessions and weak evidence.Moninder Pandher, too, walked free earlier when the high court acquitted him.It was noted that during his release in October 2023, Pandher was frail, battling health issues including tuberculosis.The bungalow D-5, once infamous, now lies overgrown and decaying — a ghostly testament to the violence that took place there.Even when courts finally render a verdict, emotional justice may remain elusive for victims and their families.The Nithari killings case, is more than a crime story; it is a mirror to systemic failures, a cautionary tale about investigative hubris, and a study in how the quest for justice can stretch over decades.The courtroom battles — convictions, acquittals and final release — have reshaped public memory of D-5 bungalow.But the wounds remain: for the families who lost children, for a village scarred by horror, and for a nation forced to reckon with how easily its systems can be outpaced by darkness.","Two decades on, nithari remains less a crime scene and more a wound. Every unanswered question still walks the streets. Confession is a double-edged sword: powerful but only if obtained fairly and documented properly. Moninder singh pandher and his domestic helper, surinder koli, were sentenced to death in the first case.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125365659,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-46652,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

""I have no family..."" Rohini Acharya Cuts Ties With Lalu Clan, Exits Politics Post-RJD Defeat

Insult meted out to my sister is intolerable: Tej Pratap

PATNA/NEW DELHI: RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad's daughter Rohini Acharya's outburst at her brother Tejashwi Yadav and his close associates for ""abusing"" and ""throwing"" her out of home is snowballing into a full-blown family feud and hints at increasing internal rumblings over the decisions of the party's anointed heir after its bid for office unravelled spectacularly in the assembly polls.As she dropped another bombshell on Sunday by saying she was dissed for donating her ""dirty kidney"" to Lalu and was accused of extracting crores of rupees and a Lok Sabha ticket, three of her sisters - Ragini, Chanda and Rajlakshmi - left their parents' Patna residence.Their brother Tej Pratap Yadav, disowned by his father and ousted from the party last year, spoke up against Rohini's ""humiliation"".Lalu, his younger son and political heir Tejashwi and other family members have maintained silence, an indication of the division and conflicted emotions within. The party too has kept mum.Some party leaders suggested that differences among the siblings have long been simmering as Tejashwi took firmer control of the party and leaned on a set of advisers loyal to him to run its affairs. That arrangement has come up for questioning.But the Bihar assembly poll debacle has opened up this style of functioning to questioning. Rohini said everybody is wondering what fate has befallen RJD, a party that governed Bihar between 1990 and 2005.Tej Pratap said in a social media post, ""Yesterday's incident has shaken me. But the insult meted out to my sister is intolerable.""I tolerated whatever happened to me but her humiliation cannot be tolerated under any condition... The consequence of this injustice will be very dire.""He accused 'Jaichands' (betrayers), widely believed to be a reference to a couple of Tejashwi's close associates, including Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Yadav, of targeting the Yadav family. Appealing to Lalu, he said, ""Just one nod, and the people of Bihar will bury these Jaichands themselves. This fight is not for any party; it is for the honour of the family, the dignity of the daughter, and the self-respect of Bihar.""As the family fallout played out, TV footage showed three more daughters of Lalu's reaching Patna airport with their children to catch a flight, reportedly for Delhi. None of them spoke to the media. Incidentally, their departure came hours after Rohini advised women to ""look after your in-laws and families and take care of your children"" rather than parents.""I would tell all married women never to do anything to save their parents, and if they have a brother, they should ask him to donate his own kidney or ask his Haryanavi friend to do so,"" she said in an emotional post. She said she had committed a blunder by not obtaining permission from her husband and in-laws and not thinking about the future of her three children before donating a kidney to her father.Earlier, she alleged she was humiliated and abused, and a slipper was lifted to hit her. She said her parents, Lalu and Rabri Devi, both former CMs, were crying and blamed Sanjay Yadav and Rameez Nemat Khan, who hails from Uttar Pradesh and is said to be Tejashwi's friend, for her ""fate"".She named her brother too but directed most of her anger at his two associates.The developments followed RJD's disastrous performance in the just-held assembly elections in Bihar, in which the party could win only 25 seats after contesting 143. Tejashwi was officially projected as MGB's chief ministerial candidate.Meanwhile, the JD(U) asked Lalu to explain the developments and act. ""She is the daughter of entire Bihar, then why are you silent, Lalu ji... Please break your silence,"" JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said.","Rohini acharya's outburst at her brother tejashwi yadav is snowballing into a full-blown family feud. Three of her sisters - ragini, chanda and rajlakshmi - left their parents' patna residence. Tej pratap yadav, disowned by his father and ousted from the party last year, spoke up against rohini's ""humiliation"" ""please break your silence,"" jd(u) spokesperson neeraj kumar said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125375382,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1080997,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In a big diplomatic win for India, Anmol Bishnoi, a key accused in the Baba Siddique murder case has been deported from the United States and is scheduled to arrive in India on Wednesday, news agency PTI reported citing officials.Anmol Bishnoi is the younger brother of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi.This comes a year after the Mumbai police initiated the process for Anmol's extradition, a suspect in the killing of NCP leader and former minister Baba Siddique in October 2024. Bishnoi is also wanted in a case related to firing on Bollywood star Salman Khan's residence in April last year.NCP leader and Baba Siddique’s son, Zeeshan Siddique said that he has received an email stating that Anmol Bishnoi had been “removed” from the United States.""My family has registered as a victim family in the United States. From the victim notification, we get updates about Anmol Bishnoi. Today, we've got a mail that the federal government has removed Anmol Bishnoi from the United States as of November 18. The question arises whether he is being deported to India? My strong request to the central government is to bring him back if he's removed from America, and for the state government as well, to bring him back to Mumbai and to make sure that he's interrogated and arrested,"" Zeeshan Siddique told ANI.""He's a threat to society. He was named in my father's murder. In Salman Khan's case, his name has been arising frequently. It's very important for us to know who has asked Anmol Bishnoi to do this. For that, they need to bring Anmol Bishnoi back to Mumbai, and if he's been removed from America, then it's a very good opportunity for the Indian government to intervene and make sure he's deported back to India,"" Zeeshan Siddique added.Bishnoi's arrest comes after he was reportedly detained in Canada, where he was found in possession of a Russian passport obtained through fraudulent means.Baba Siddique, a former Maharashtra minister, was shot dead on October 12, 2024 in Bandra. Several members of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang were subsequently arrested.","Anmol bishnoi, accused in baba siddique murder case, to be deported to india from us.

NEW DELHI: Janshakti Janta Dal founder Tej Pratap Yadav on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to investigate allegations of “mental and physical pressure” on his parents, RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad and former chief minister Rabri Devi.Calling it an attack on the ""very soul"" of RJD, Tej Pratap alleged that ""certain traitors"" are destroying both the ""family and the organisation"" in an apparent reference to Sanjay Yadav, Rameez Nemat Khan, both aides of Tejashwi Yadav.""It is being said that some people, Jaichands, are making attempts to keep my parents Lalu Prasad ji and my mother under mental and physical pressure.

She claimed she had been “driven out” of her parents’ home by associates of Tejashwi Yadav following the RJD’s poor showing in the Bihar assembly polls.Rohini, who donated a kidney to Lalu Prasad a few years ago and unsuccessfully contested the Saran Lok Sabha seat last year, expressed anguish over being accused of exploiting her medical sacrifice.

Calm And Radical: Dr Umar’s Pre-Blast Video Exposes Educated New Face Of Terror Behind Delhi Attack

NEW DELHI: BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla on Tuesday launched a sharp attack on the Congress after its MP Imran Masood referred to suicide bomber Umar Un Nabi as a “misguided youth”.Accusing the Opposition party of prioritising “vote bank niti over rashtra niti”, he said the Congress had repeatedly attempted to soften the perception of terror acts for political gain.Reacting to Congress leader's remarks, Poonawalla wrote on X: ""On a day that a chilling new video of suicide bomber Umar Nabi has emerged where he is seen justifying his act of terror before carrying out the attack near Delhi's Red Fort, Congress MP Imran Masood calls him “bhatka hua yuva” (misguided youth).""The Congress MP has described suicide bomber Umar Un Nabi as a “misguided youth”, stressing that his actions were against both Islam and the nation.“The video that has come (of accused Umar Ul Nabi), I do not agree with that video at all. Suicide is not permissible in Islam under any circumstances. By killing innocent people along with yourself, you are acting against the country. These are misguided people whose words cannot present the picture of Islam,” he said speaking to reporters.Investigators recovered the footage during the probe, in which Umar Un Nabi is seen calmly defending what he calls a “martyrdom operation,” an attempt to justify the suicide blast he would later execute near the Red Fort.In the undated video, he argues that suicide attacks are “misunderstood” and claims such operations are carried out with absolute certainty of death as an act of religious duty.Sitting alone in a room, he speaks without hesitation, insisting that the act he is preparing for should not be viewed as suicide, but as a form of martyrdom. Officials believe the video was created to brainwash others and radicalise more educated youth into joining the terror module.Poonawalla also alleged that other Opposition leaders had done the same in the past by downplaying terror and defending those involved in such acts.“Earlier Hussain Dalwai, Chidambaram, Mehbooba Mufti, Tariq Anwar, Abu Azmi of SP labelled the terrorists as innocent or justified their acts by saying ‘circumstances’ were responsible,” Poonwalla further wrote in his post.Poonawalla alleged that the Congress has a long history of downplaying terror for political gain and pointed to past instances to support his charge.He further wrote on X: “This is nothing but keeping Votebank Niti above Rashtra Niti. Congress has become Muslim League Maowadi Congress. From defending Afzal & Yakub & Batla terrorists to shielding Naxals and justifying Umar’s actions.”Last week, former home minister P Chidambaram had questioned the Centre over what he called the rising threat of “homegrown terrorism” following the arrests linked to the blast.Similarly, PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti had alleged that the government was projecting “false normalcy” in Jammu & Kashmir and claimed the national security situation had worsened, citing the Red Fort incident as an example.The Red Fort blast on November 10 killed 15 people and injured several others. The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which has taken over the probe, has so far arrested multiple accused linked to a terror module inspired by groups such as Jaish-e-Mohammed and ISIS and is investigating the full conspiracy behind the attack.",Bjp spokesperson shehzad poonawalla launches attack on congress.

PM Modi Predicts Major Congress Split After NDA’s Bihar Win And Warns Allies Of Growing Instability

NEW DELHI: Lalu Prasad Yadav 's daughter Rohini Acharya, who disowned the family after RJD's Bihar poll debacle, took another potshot at brother Tejashwi Yadav , saying those who called her kidney ""impure"" should first ""donate their kidneys in his (Lalu's) name"" to the needy.Rohini said those who claim to do things in Lalu Yadav's name should ""stop offering false sympathy and instead step forward to donate their kidneys to the lakhs of poor patients in hospitals who are counting their final breaths for want of one"".""If they truly care about Lalu Ji, they should donate their kidneys in his name,"" she said in a dig at Tejashwi, who is RJD's heir apparent. Rohini also challenged Tejashwi to ""gather the courage to debate her openly on a public platform"".""Those who criticised a married daughter for donating her kidney to her father should gather the courage to debate her openly on a public platform,"" she said.Lalu's daughter also lashed out at Tejahswi's close aide, Sanjay Yadav, whom she called ""Haryanvi Mahapurush"" and accused ""Haryanvi troll armies"" of endlessly abusing her.""Let the act of this supreme donation, giving a kidney to someone in need, begin with those who called the daughter’s kidney ""impure.”Then let the so-called 'Haryanvi Mahapurush' come forward, followed by the pliant journalists and the Haryanvi troll armies who endlessly abuse me. People whose blood runs dry at the thought of donating even a single bottle of blood are preaching about donating a kidney?"" she wrote on X in Hindi.Also read: Tej Pratap flags ‘pressure’ on Lalu, Rabri; makes plea to PM Modi, Shah Rohini Acharya, the second of RJD chief Lalu Prasad's nine children and the donor of the kidney that saved him, announced Saturday she was quitting politics and ""disowning"" her family, igniting a storm that cut across party lines and private loyalties a day after the party's crushing defeat in Bihar.“I don’t have any family, you should go and ask Tejashwi, Sanjay and Rameez. They are the ones who have expelled me from the family because they don’t want to take responsibility,” she told reporters.“The whole world is saying that we will ask questions to whoever becomes Chanakya. The party workers are asking Chanakya why the RJD has reached this state. If Sanjay, Rameez’s name is taken, you will be thrown out of the house and defamed. You will also be hit with slippers,” she added.Her remarks echoed the frustration she had earlier expressed in a social media post announcing that she was quitting politics and “disowning” her family.Hours after announcing publicly that she had severed ties with her family, Lalu Prasad Yadav’s daughter, Rohini Acharya, claimed she was ""thrown out"" by her brother, Tejashwi Yadav, and his close aides, Sanjay Yadav and Rameez.Speaking on the Rashtriya Janata Dal 's (RJD) humiliating defeat in the Bihar assembly polls, Rohini said she was ""disgraced, abused, and even hit"" when she questioned Sanjay Yadav and Rameez.Later, Tej Pratap Yadav launched a strong attack on individuals within his family and RJD, accusing them of acting like “traitors” and warning that he would not accept any insult directed at his sister.In a post shared on his Janshakti Janta Dal party’s Instagram account, Tej Pratap warned those he described as “traitors” and made a heartfelt appeal to his father, Lalu Prasad Yadav.“Yesterday’s incident has shaken me to the core. What happened to me — I endured it. But the insult done to my sister is absolutely unbearable under any circumstances,” he wrote, adding: “Listen, traitors— If you target our family, the people of Bihar will never forgive you. When the emotions of the people are wounded, the dust covering their judgment is blown away.”The RJD, which was the largest party in the Mahagathbandhan, saw its tally collapse from 75 to just 25 seats -- one of its most disappointing performances since 2010. The dramatic slide, which resulted in the loss of over 100 seats to NDA allies, came despite the coalition uniting behind Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial face.","Rohini acharya says those who called her kidney ""impure"" should first ""donate their kidneys in his (lalu's) name"" to the needy.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday reportedly raised concerns about the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) process during a meeting with AICC office-bearers from 12 states and Union Territories where electoral roll revision is ongoing. He emphasised that the party needs to counter this 'politically, organisationally and legally, as per sources, quoted by PTI.Rahul noted that while the Election Commission should ensure accurate electoral rolls, it appeared to be shifting responsibility to political parties, according to the PTI sources. He questioned the implementation of the procedure, alleging it could lead to the removal of legitimate voters.Other Congress leaders also expressed their opposition to SIR, invoking their 'vote-chori' claim again or calling it a 'sinister attempt to destroy Democracy"".The review meeting included Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge , Gandhi, and AICC general secretary K C Venugopal, along with state unit chiefs, CLP leaders and secretaries from the regions undergoing Special Intensive Revision.Congress has intensified its 'vote chori' stance, criticising the Election Commission's handling of the SIR process as ""deeply disappointing"" and called for the commission to prove its independence from BJP influence.Kharge, who led the meeting, accused the BJP of using the process as a tool for ""vote chori"". He said on X, ""We held a comprehensive strategy review with AICC general secretaries, AICC in-charges, PCCs, CLPs and AICC secretaries from the states/UTs where the SIR process is underway. The Congress Party is unequivocally committed to safeguarding the integrity of the electoral rolls.""AICC general secretary, organisation, K C Venugopal also took jab at EC, with regards to SIR. ""We are going to the streets. During the first week of December, the Congress party is organising a massive rally in Ramleela Maidan with lakhs of people attending it,"" he told reporters, adding that the Congress will expose the Election Commission by organising the protest event, as quoted by PTI.Venugopal further said while purification of electoral rolls is an undeniably necessary objective, it must be carried out in a bona fide manner.""The ECI's conduct thus far has been to further the BJP's 'vote chori' agenda, setting aside its Constitutional obligation of impartiality. We will relentlessly fight against their attempts to manipulate voter rolls through unfair deletions or the insertion of bogus voters to create space for the BJP to carry out its nefarious activities,"" he said on X.""It is our democracy at stake, and we will stand up to every attempt - big or small - that threatens our Constitutional framework,"" he further claimed. He said that the general feeling of the Pradesh Congress Committees was that the Election Commission was purposefully trying to delete votes of some sections of the society. ""The design of the SIR itself is to delete targeted votes. This is what we experienced in Bihar also and now they are going to start it in 12 states,"" he said, adding they announced a different 'Special Revision' for Assam.""This is a sinister attempt by the Election Commission to destroy democracy in this country. It is completely unethical and completely undemocratic,"" he alleged, as quoted by PTI.Following their significant defeat in Bihar, where the NDA secured 202 seats compared to Mahagathbandhan's 35, the Congress questioned the Election Commission's conduct during the electoral process. During his Bihar campaign also, Gandhi consistently raised the allegations of ""vote chori"".As the opposition stays firm on opposing SIR, the Election Commission reported that over 50.25 crore enumeration forms have been distributed across the 12 states and UTs, reaching 98.54 per cent of the 50.97 crore eligible voters.The first phase of the process includes regions such as- Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Puducherry, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and Lakshadweep.Four of these regions - Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala and West Bengal - will hold elections in 2026. Assam, also due for elections in 2026, received approval for a 'special revision' of electoral rolls on Monday.The second phase of SIR began on November 4 and continues until December 4.Last week, Rahul described the Bihar results as ""surprising"" and questioned the election's fairness. He indicated that the Congress and INDIA bloc would analyse the results thoroughly.The party alleged that the results demonstrated ""vote chori on a gigantic scale -- masterminded by the prime minister, the home minister, the EC"".","Rahul gandhi reportedly raised concerns about the special intensive revision (sir) process.

‘Nitish Still X-Factor’ Pavan Verma Decodes Why Jan Suraaj Couldn’t Break Through in Bihar Polls

NEW DELHI: Jan Suraaj supremo Prashant Kishor on Tuesday said he takes '100 per cent responsibility' for his party’s poor performance in the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections. This was his first reaction after the poll verdict.Interacting with reporters in Patna, Kishor admitted: “We made an honest effort, but it was completely unsuccessful. There’s no harm in admitting this. Forget about systemic change; we couldn’t even bring about a change in power. But we certainly played some role in changing Bihar’s politics… There must have been some mistake in our efforts, in our thinking, in the way we explained that the public had not elected us. If the public did not show faith in us, then the responsibility for that is completely mine. I take that responsibility 100% on myself, that I could not win the faith of the people of Bihar.”Kishor has also vowed to observe a ‘maun upvas’ (vow of silence) for “failing to change the government”. As an act of atonement, he announced that he will undertake a day-long silent fast at the Gandhi Bhitiharwa Ashram on November 20.""I will work twice as hard as you've seen me work over the past three years and put in all my energy. There's no question of backing down. There's no turning back until I fulfil my resolve to make Bihar better. I failed to explain to the people of Bihar the basis on which they should vote and why they should create a new system. Therefore, as atonement, I will observe a day-long silent fast at the Gandhi Bhitiharwa Ashram on November 20th,"" Kishor said.The Jan Suraaj Party got 0 seats in the election, a stunning outcome for a new entrant once pitched as the “third force” in the bitterly contested battle between the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured 202 seats and the Mahagathbandhan (MGB), which won 35.Responding to questions on whether he would resign after the defeat, Kishor dismissed the idea. The Jan Suraaj chief said that he was not holding any official post to step down from.“What position am I holding that I should resign? I had said that if (JDU) gets more than 25 seats, I will retire. From which position should I resign? I did not say that I will leave Bihar. I have left politics. I do not do politics, but I did not say that I will stop speaking for the people of Bihar,” he said.Kishor also vowed to continue his campaign in Bihar with greater determination despite the setback. He said he would intensify his efforts on the ground and not retreat from his mission to reform the state.""I will work twice as hard as you've seen me work over the past three years and put in all my energy. There's no question of backing down. There's no turning back until I fulfil my resolve to make Bihar better,” he said.He further acknowledged shortcomings in communicating his message to voters and said he would atone for it with a symbolic gesture.“I failed to explain to the people of Bihar the basis on which they should vote and why they should create a new system. Therefore, as atonement, I will observe a day-long silent fast at the Gandhi Bhitiharwa Ashram on November 20th... We may have made mistakes, but we have not committed any crime. We have not committed the crime of spreading caste-based poison in society. We have not played Hindu-Muslim politics in Bihar. We have not committed the crime of dividing people in the name of religion. We have not committed the crime of giving money to the poor, innocent people of Bihar and buying their votes,"" Kishor added.For years, Prashant Kishor was regarded as one of India’s most successful political strategists and was known as the man behind a string of high-profile electoral wins.But his most anticipated venture, Jan Suraaj, has turned into a spectacular failure. Launched after an extended “padyatra” in Bihar, the party fielded 236 candidates, drawing heavily on social-media outreach and promising a new brand of politics focused on meritocracy, youth migration, jobs and improved governance.Despite the high-profile campaign, the party lost its deposit in 236 of the 238 seats it contested. While Jan Suraaj had staked much on converting social-media traction into votes, the strategy evidently faltered in a state where caste affiliation, local networks and long-standing alliances retain deep influence.The Bihar Assembly elections were conducted in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the results declared on November 14.","Prashant kishor says he takes '100 per cent responsibility' for his party's poor performance. Jan suraaj party got 0 seats in the 2025 bihar assembly elections. As an act of atonement, he announced that he will undertake a day-long silent fast.

Delhi Police Alleges 2020 Riots Were Timed With Trump Visit And Aimed To Spark Pan India Unrest

NEW DEHI: During a Supreme Court hearing on bail plea in the 2020 Delhi riots case, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was representating Delhi police , on Tuesday called the anti-CAA protest triggered violence an ""attempt to divide society on communal lines"". Mehta also aruged that accused were responsible for delay in trial of the case, which has been a key point of contention.""There was an attempt to divide society on communal lines, it was not merely an agitation against CAA,""Tushar Mehta told the top court.Strenuously opposing the bail pleas filed by activists Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and others in the February 2020 riots in the city, Mehta told the Supreme Court that it was not a spontaneous riot but an attack on the sovereignty of the nation.""First of all, that myth to be busted. This was not a spontaneous riot. It was a well designed, well crafted, well orchestrated, pre-planned riot. That will emerge from the evidence collected,"" Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and N V Anjaria.""Sharjeel Imam says it's his heartfelt wish for 'chakka jaam' for every city where Muslims reside. Not just in Delhi,"" Mehta submitted.The solicitor general said a narrative is being built on social media that something very serious is going on with young people.However, the accused themselves are responsible for the delay in trial.Khalid, Imam, Gulfisha Fatima, Meeran Haider and Rehman were booked under the anti-terror law and provisions of the erstwhile IPC for allegedly being the ""masterminds"" of the February 2020 riots, which left 53 people dead and over 700 injured.Meanwhile, the Delhi high court on Tuesday directed the police to update it on the status of investigations into the 2020 Delhi riots.A bench of Justices Vivek Chaudhary and Manoj Jain issued the direction while hearing a batch of petitions related to the February 2020 violence, including pleas seeking FIRs against several political leaders for alleged hate speeches.The bench noted orally that the petitions have remained pending for six years despite the availability of an alternate legal remedy that the petitioners had not pursued.During the hearing, counsel for one of the petitioners highlighted the deaths that occurred during the riots. The bench responded that FIRs had already been registered and the police were conducting investigations, leaving “nothing” to be addressed in the existing petitions.The petitioner’s lawyer, however, alleged that the police were not conducting a fair probe and urged the court to order an independent investigation.To this, the bench said: ""You challenge it before the magistrate. The magistrate will supervise. These are questions of facts. We cannot entertain questions of facts in writ petitions. You can give that evidence to the magistrate, who will look into it and pass orders. The high court cannot do this.""Reiterating that the petitioners had not availed the appropriate legal route for six years, the court remarked: ""These petitions are pending for so long for no good reason. FIRs have been registered and the police are investigating.""The bench listed the matter for November 21 and asked Delhi Police counsel to submit the current status of the investigation and the number of FIRs filed.",Solicitor general tushar mehta told the supreme court that it was not a spontaneous riot but an attack on the sovereignty of the nation.

PATNA: A visibly emotional Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who has been publicly accused by sister Rohini Acharya of misbehaviour and attacked by elder brother Tej Pratap, on Monday told RJD MLAs that they were free to elect someone else as their legislative party leader before his father and party patriarch Lalu Prasad quickly intervened to say he should continue to lead the party in the Bihar assembly, according to a legislator who was present at the meeting.Soon thereafter, the newly elected RJD MLAs chose Tejashwi as their legislative party leader.
