Hinting at internal discussions, he revealed that he has already expressed his dissatisfaction within the party forum.He emphasised that he has a proper platform to address these issues and that he has fulfilled his duties and responsibilities toward the hill community within the party framework.Baluni holds a significant position in national politics of BJP and his statement makes it likely that major political upheavals could be expected in Uttarakhand in coming days.Aggarwal faced significant backlash following remarks made during a legislative assembly session.He suggested that Uttarakhand was not established exclusively for 'Pahadis' (hill people), a statement perceived by many as derogatory towards the hill communities.Aggarwal expressed regret, stating that his words had been misconstrued and that he had no intention of offending any community.","Garhwal mp anil baluni described premchand aggarwal's comment on hill communities as ""inappropriate"" and ""not only painful, but also unfortunate"" baluni holds a significant position in national politics of bjp and his statement makes it likely that major political upheavals could be expected in uttarakhand.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118794131,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-839471,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission EC on Friday announced that it will resolve the longstanding issue of duplicate Electors Photo Identity Card (EPIC) numbers within the next three months. In an official statement, the commission acknowledged the presence of multiple voters with the same EPIC numbers due to past discrepancies in the allotment process. This comes as West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Congress raised the issue accusing the poll body of voters list manipulation to favor the BJP.In an official statement, the EC clarified that despite duplication, all electors linked to the electoral roll of a particular polling station can only vote at that designated location, ensuring no misuse of duplicate IDs. A sample verification of over 100 voters with identical EPIC numbers confirmed that they were genuine electors.""Irrespective of an EPIC number, an elector who is linked to the electoral roll of a particular polling station can cast his vote at that polling station only and nowhere else,"" the commission stated in its official release.The poll body said the issue arose due to incorrect series usage when the EPIC system was introduced in the year 2000. Since individual states and union territories managed electoral roll databases independently, errors in numbering went undetected at the national level.""It is a matter of electoral integrity. We have taken cognizance of the issue and are committed to ensuring a unique national EPIC number for all voters,"" said Anuj Chandak, director at the election commission.To rectify this, the commission said it will ensure a unique national EPIC number for all existing voters with duplicate numbers and for new electors in the future.Within minutes of the statement, Mamata's TMC reacted strongly alleging that the poll body's remark was in fact admission of the guilt.""Election Commission of India has finally admitted & accepted their guilt that duplicate EPIC numbers have been allotted to multiple people. This is a scam & answers must be given: TMC's Saket Gokhale said.""All of this has happened because CM Mamata Banerjee nailed the lies of the ECI and exposed this scam. After being in denial, ECI now says it will “fix the issue” in just 3 months.

What led to language debate

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah took a swipe at Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin , saying under Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led administration, the CISF aspirants could write the exam in their respective regional languages.He also asked Stalin to commence engineering and medical education in Tamil in the state.""Earlier, there was no place for your mother tongue in CAPF exams. You could not write CAPF exam in Bengali, Kannada or in Tamil languages but PM Modi decided that now candidates can appear for the CAPF exams in their mother tongue as well,"" Amit Shah said while addressing 56th Raising Day of the CISF at RTC Thakkolam in Ranipet, about 70 km from Chennai.""I want to urge the CM of Tamil Nadu to take steps towards introducing curriculum of medical and engineering courses in Tamil language as soon as possible..."" he added.He said Tamil Nadu's culture played a vital role in strengthening India's cultural stream.""Be it administrative reforms, attaining spiritual heights, education or the unity and integrity of the nation - Tamil Nadu has reinforced Indian culture in every sphere,"" Shah said at the event, which marked a spectacular march past of contingents, yoga display and commando operations.In the latest episode of language war, Stalin called the Centre's three-language formula under the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020 a ""Hindi colonialism"" and said that Tamil Nadu will not tolerate ""Hindi colonialism"" replacing ""British colonialism"".""History is clear. Those who tried to impose Hindi on Tamil Nadu have either been defeated or later changed their stance and aligned with DMK. Tamil Nadu will not tolerate Hindi colonialism replacing British colonialism,"" he wrote.The Tamil Nadu CM ridiculed the state BJP's signature drive supporting NEP, daring them to contest the forthcoming assembly elections on this particular matter.""Now the BJP's circus-like signature campaign for the three-language formula has become a laughing stock in Tamil Nadu. I challenge them to make this their core agenda in the 2026 Assembly elections and let it be a referendum on Hindi imposition,"" Stalin posted on X.Stalin criticised Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan for initiating an unwinnable confrontation. ""The tree may prefer calm, but the wind will not subside.""He noted that the Education Minister instigated this exchange of letters whilst they were performing their duties. Stalin stated that the minister overstepped by attempting to coerce an entire state into accepting #HindiImposition, resulting in consequences for reviving an unwinnable dispute. He affirmed that Tamil Nadu would not yield to pressure.Referencing the names of Union government's programmes, institutions and accolades, Stalin indicated that Hindi has been extensively enforced, creating difficulties for non-Hindi speakers, who constitute the majority in India.""Men may come, men may go. But even long after the dominance of Hindi is shattered in India, history will remember that it was DMK that stood as the vanguard,"" he wrote.The Tamil Nadu administration has declined to implement the Prime Minister's Schools for Rising India (PM-SHRI) programme, expressing opposition to the New Education Policy (NEP), which they believe is attempting to enforce Hindi in their Tamil-speaking region. They also assert that the centre is delaying fund disbursement to advance its linguistic agenda.This disagreement stems from tensions between the BJP-led central administration and the DMK-governed Tamil Nadu, following Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan's call for the state to embrace the three-language system.Chief Minister M K Stalin responded by alleging Hindi imposition and the withholding of Samagra Shiksha allocations.Tamil Nadu's resistance to Hindi implementation dates back to 1950 when non-Hindi states opposed the central government's intention to establish Hindi as the exclusive official language post-1965. Pradhan's recent statements have reignited criticism by challenging Tamil Nadu's established two-language system.The controversy escalated on February 15 when Pradhan, speaking in Varanasi, urged Tamil Nadu to adopt the three-language formula for educational parity. He suggested ""political motivation"" behind DMK's rejection of NEP, stating, ""They have to accept the NEP in letter and spirit.""Stalin contended that the BJP was utilising NEP to covertly promote Hindi. ""The Centre knows it can't directly impose Hindi without facing fierce opposition, so it uses education as a backdoor,"" he said.Stalin accused the centre of ""blackmail"" regarding fund allocation and wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting Samagra Shiksha funds. He firmly stated that Tamil Nadu would reject NEP even if offered Rs 10,000 crore.Sharing a video clip of Pradhan's remarks to reporters in Varanasi on February 15, Stalin, in a post on 'X,' quoted him as saying that Tamil Nadu must align with the Indian Constitution and that the three-language policy is the rule of law.""We are not opposed to any language but will remain firm in opposing its imposition. We are not opposing the NEP only for the attempt to thrust Hindi but for several other reasons as well. The NEP is regressive. It will drive students away from schools,"" Stalin asserted.","Union home minister amit shah said under pm modi-led administration, the cisf aspirants could write the exam in their respective regional languages. He also asked stalin to commence engineering and medical education in tamil in the state.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118776741,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-26866,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Friday once again indulged into a heated argument with an RJD MLC, claiming that women had no issues in the state. This came after the opposition party leader questioned the JDU government over higher education of females in the state.Urmila Thakur was voicing her dissatisfaction with education minister Sunil Kumar's response to a question she had raised in the House when the chief minister began recounting what his government had done for the female literacy in the state. Thakur highlighted the situation in her Begusarai district, where many girls are deprived of education due to the need to walk four to five kilometers to reach the nearest school.The chief minister defended his government saying, ""Do you people even know what we have done for girls' education? Village girls hardly went to schools in Bihar until we came to power.""Citing her own example, Thakur responded saying, ""Sir please do not say that. I too hail from a village. I belong to an older generation, yet I did complete my schooling.""Another RJD MLC Munni Devi Rajak then stepped in, and questioned the seasoned leader: ""You have no idea what has been done by us for women. You may be women yourselves but what has been your contribution?""Visibly offended by this, Kumar stood up launched a direct swipe at former CM Rabri Devi saying, ""When her husband began to sink, he installed his wife (in the CM's post).""He further attacked the RJD's reign and said, ""Your party (RJD) did nothing. You people know nothing. Whatever has been done for women, it has been done by me. Now women have no problems.""RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav criticised the comments and reminded Kumar that Rabri Devi was first woman CM of Bihar.""CM Nitish Kumar should remember that Rabri Devi is the first female CM of Bihar...There is nothing much to comment anything on him. His deteriorating health signals that he is no longer able to run Bihar. The designation of CM has dignity.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka high court on Friday cancelled the Enforcement Directorate summons issued to chief minister Siddaramaiah 's wife Parvathi & state minister BS Suresha in the Mysore Urban Development Authority (Muda) land allotment scam.The HC had reserved its verdict on petitions filed by Parvathi and urban development minister Suresh, challenging the ED summons related to the Muda case.""I am the wife of the CM. I have a moral responsibility to ensure that such allegations should be doused. I returned (the 14 sites) to the rightful authority and that cannot be admittance of guilt,"" senior advocate Sandesh Chouta, appearing for Parvathi had said.Parvathi faces allegations of profiting from an allegedly illegal land allotment in central Mysuru, valued at approximately Rs 56 crore, reportedly in exchange for a plot acquired by Muda from the chief minister's wife on the city's outskirts.The controversy centers on alleged irregularities in the allotment of compensatory sites, with a 3.2-acre land parcel gifted to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s wife, Parvathi, by her brother Mallikarjunaswamy in 2010 at its core.After Muda acquired the land, Parvathi sought compensation and was granted 14 plots, reportedly far more valuable than the original property. Opposition parties claim the total value of the scam could range between Rs 3,000 crore and Rs 4,000 crore.","Parvathi faces allegations of profiting from an allegedly illegal land allotment in central mysuru.

The Tughlak dynasty

NEW DELHI: BJP Rajya Sabha MP Dinesh Sharma and Union minister Krishan Pal Gujar have changed the nameplates of their respective Tughlak Lane houses to Swami Vivekananda Marg .Dinesh Sharma, who performed a housewarming ceremony for his new residence, posted a photo on X with a nameplate on the entrance written Swami Vivekananda Marg.""Today, along with my family, I performed a housewarming ceremony and formally moved into my new residence on Swami Vivekananda Marg (Tughlak Lane) in New Delhi,"" Dinesh Sharma wrote on X.Last month, BJP's Mustafabad MLA Mohan Bisht proposed renaming the northeast Delhi constituency, which has a significant minority community population, to ""Shiv Vihar"" or ""Shiv Puri"". Bisht justified the proposal, saying the Hindu population in the constituency was higher. ""On one side, there are 58%, and on the other, 42%. It is the right of the 58% that the name should be changed accordingly,"" he said.The changing of names of places, roads, and institutions is part of the ruling BJP's border ideological agenda to shed the colonial legacies to reflect India’s indigenous heritage.The party also claims that the move is to honour historical figures, particularly those who contributed significantly in shaping Indian society.Multiple instances of renaming have taken place under the BJP rule. In 2018, Allahabad was renamed Prayagraj to restore its ancient identity linked to the Hindu pilgrimage site, Prayag. The same year, Mughal Sarai Railway Station was renamed Deen Dayal Upadhyay Junction in honour of the BJP ideologue.In 2018, Faizabad District was renamed Ayodhya to emphasize its religious and cultural significance in Hinduism. In 2021, Hoshangabad in Madhya Pradesh was renamed Narmadapuram to highlight its connection to the sacred Narmada River while removing Mughal-era influences.Most recently, in 2023, Maharashtra's Aurangabad was renamed Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, and Osmanabad became Dharashiv, shedding Mughal and Islamic references in favour of local historical and cultural identities.Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq (reigned 1320–1325) was the founder of the Tughlaq dynasty and the ruler of the Delhi Sultanate . He established the dynasty after overthrowing the Khiljis and is known for his military conquests, administrative reforms, and the construction of Tughlaqabad Fort in Delhi.His rule focused on strengthening the empire's defense and economy. However, he died in 1325 under mysterious circumstances, allegedly due to a conspiracy by his son, Muhammad bin Tughlaq, who succeeded him.Muhammad bin Tughlaq was the second ruler of the Tughlaq dynasty and is known for his ambitious but often impractical policies. He attempted several bold reforms, including shifting the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad, introducing token currency, and launching costly military campaigns, most of which failed due to poor execution.His policies led to economic distress, rebellions, and the weakening of the Delhi Sultanate. His reign is often remembered for administrative failures and unrest. He died in 1351 while campaigning in Sindh.","Bjp rajya sabha mp dinesh sharma and union minister krishan pal gujar have changed the nameplates of their respective tughlak lane houses to swami vivekananda marg.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Friday announced launching a joint action committee with the chief ministers of several states against Centre's bid to reorganise the constituencies for Lok Sabha.Reiterating his stance that Union government's push for delimitation is a ""blatant assault on federalism "", Stalin wrote to chief ministers of Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Telangana, Punjab and Odisha seeking allegiance ""for an uncompromising fight against this unfair exercise.""In a social media post on X, Stalin said, ""The Union govt's plan for Delimitation is a blatant assault on federalism, punishing States that ensured population control & good governance by stripping away our rightful voice in Parliament. We will not allow this democratic injustice!""""I have written to Hon'ble chief ministers Thiru Pinarayi Vijayan, Siddaramaiah, Revanth Reddy, Chandrababu Naidu, Mamata Banerjee, Bhagwant Mann and Mohan Majhi and party heads in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, West Bengal, Odisha & Punjab, calling for an uncompromising fight against this unfair exercise,"" he added.He also called upon political parties to send senior representatives for the joint action committee scheduled to be held at Chennai on March 22.""We are forming a Joint Action Committee (JAC) to defend our States from being silenced. I call upon parties to send a senior representative. First JAC meeting in Chennai on March 22, 2025. Let us stand together not as separate political entities but as protectors of our people's future,"" Stalin said.This comes amid the ongoing rift between Tamil Nadu chief minister and Centre over delimitation and New Education Policy. Stalin expressed concern about the potential reduction in Parliamentary seats, attributing it to the state's successful implementation of family planning initiatives.Stalin had also suggested newly married couples to start families quickly to ensure adequate political representation post-delimitation. He acknowledged the state's successful family planning initiatives but expressed worry about their current implications. He also advised the couples to proper Tamil names for their future children.Delimitation, a constitutional process in India, involves redrawing parliamentary and assembly constituencies to ensure equal population representation across electoral districts. This process determines how many representatives each state gets in Parliament based on population size.The process is guided by specific constitutional provisions under Articles 82 and 170 of the Indian Constitution. Article 82 mandates that Parliament must enact a Delimitation Act after each national census to redefine Lok Sabha constituency boundaries and numbers. Article 170 establishes guidelines for State Legislative Assembly delimitation, determining seat allocation based on population data.","Stalin wrote to chief ministers of kerala, karnataka, andhra pradesh, west bengal, telangana, punjab and odisha seeking allegiance ""for an uncompromising fight against this unfair exercise"" he also called upon political parties to send senior representatives for the joint action committee scheduled to be held at chennai on march 22.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118784720,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-722022,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
