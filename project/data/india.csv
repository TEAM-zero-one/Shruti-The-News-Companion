Has govt announced a delimitation commission or appointed a judge for delimitation. In Tamil Nadu, they are raising the issue to hide their corruption. I assure people of south India BJP will not do injustice, and their seats will remain as per pro rata basis. If they stop this noise, then they have to answer about corruption and dynasty politics. They don't want the poll on issues,"" Shah said.""Delimitation commission is formed on the basis of an Act. The Bill will be brought in Parliament and then it will be discussed. It might be sent to a parliamentary committee. So, why the hullabaloo now?"" he asked.Justifying the recent waqf legislation, Shah clearly said the new law will end years of injustice and corruption and usher in an era of justice and equality for the Muslim community. ""Congress brought changes to the waqf Act to appease its vote bank in 2013, months before the 2014 elections. Twenty-one lakh acres of land was added to the waqf property after 2013. Those opposing the waqf Act have vested interests,"" he added.The minister also stressed Congress and others in the opposition had created unrest over enactment of Citizenship Amendment Act claiming it was an instrument to snatch citizenship of Muslims. ""It has been two years since CAA was implemented. I publicly challenge Rahul Gandhi to tell us if even a single Muslim has lost citizenship,"" he added amid incidents of violent protests in parts of the country against the changes in the waqf Act.Asked about the govt continuing to push for 'one nation, one election' when it lacked the two-thirds majority in Parliament needed to carry out amendments to the Constitution, Shah said in the next 2-3 years, the atmosphere in the country would be such that no party would be able to refuse one nation, one election, because it was in the interest of the nation.Criticising the WB govt on the issue of infiltrators, Shah said, ""I would like to request the people of Bengal to form a BJP govt in the coming polls, the problem of infiltrators will end from there.

Singapore SC quashes ex-CJI Dipak Misra's 'copy-pasted' arbitration award,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/singapore-sc-quashes-ex-cji-dipak-misras-copy-pasted-arbitration-award/articleshow/120141717.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major embarrassment, Singapore Supreme Court has quashed an arbitral award against the special purpose vehicle ( SPV ) set up to manage dedicated freight corridors in India after finding that the tribunal headed by retired CJI Dipak Misra had copied 212 of 451 paragraphs from two earlier awards involving the same parties but on different issues.Though the tribunal also comprised MP HC ex-Chief Justice K K Lahoti and ex-CJ of J&K HC Gita Mittal, a Singapore SC bench led by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said since the other two were not part of the earlier awards, it couldn't be ascertained whether they were even aware of Misra's ""copy-paste"" job.The Singapore SC was firm that the copying compromised the integrity of the arbitration process and thus it did not adhere to the ""principles of natural justice"".The court said, ""The patently substantial material derived from parallel arbitrations were extraneous considerations that hadn't been raised to the parties' attention. The material formed such a pervasive part of the award that it simply could not be overlooked. It was plain that it was neither contemplated nor agreed to by the parties that the award could be prepared by such a process. We agree with the (Singapore HC) judge there had been a breach of the fair hearing rule.""By its award dated Nov 24, 2023, the Justice Misra-led tribunal had ruled in favour of the three firms which formed a consortium to bag the contract for Western Dedicated Freight Corridor in Aug 2015. A dispute arose because of the Indian govt's decision to raise labour wages, leading to the consortium demanding more money which was contested by the SPV, and the matter was referred to the Justice Misra-led arbitration tribunal.Upholding the Singapore HC's decision to set aside the award, Justices Menon and Steven Chong in a 40-page judgment analysed the award, found it plagued by copying and in breach of the principles of natural justice. The Justice Menon-led bench accepted the SPV's arguments and rejected those of the consortium.The SPV contended that Justice Misra, during the arbitration, had used extensive material derived from parallel arbitrations. ""It is also common ground that the award was not drafted afresh. Rather, the parallel awards were used as templates, with adjustments made to account for what were thought to be the specificities of the arbitration,"" the Singapore SC said.CJ Menon said the SPV had abandoned some of the submissions made in the parallel arbitrations and replaced these with new arguments unique to the arbitration at hand. ""These new arguments arose because of the slightly different factual matrix presented by the arbitration: for instance, the difference in the length of delay between the issuance of the notification and the consortium's claim allowed the SPV to make additional arguments on estoppel,"" he said.""Despite this, the parallel awards were used as templates in drafting the award to a very substantial degree. It is undisputed that at least 212 paragraphs from the parallel awards were retained in the 451-paragraph award. This has several implications,"" the Singapore SC said.""We also consider that the expectation of equality between the arbitrators was compromised. While, as we have noted, there is no evidence as to what transpired between the members of the tribunal, it is known that the two co-arbitrators in this case were not privy to the parallel arbitrations. They would thus have had no direct access to any material or knowledge derived from those proceedings, but which appeared to have significantly influenced the outcome of the present arbitration. The integrity of the arbitration was, therefore, further compromised as a result,"" it said.",Singapore supreme court has quashed an arbitral award against the special purpose vehicle ( spv) the tribunal headed by retired cji dipak misra had copied 212 of 451 paragraphs from two earlier awards involving the same parties.

AI puts flyer who urinated on co-passenger on no-fly list for 30 days,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/business-class-peegate-redux-this-time-on-air-indias-delhi-bangkok-flight/articleshow/120129817.cms,"NEW DELHI: A business class passenger seated in the second row of an Air India Airbus A320 flying from Delhi to Bangkok Wednesday urinated on a traveller in the front row, just before landing. Sources say this person “had alcohol like a significant number of travellers on flights between Delhi & the Thai capital but he was not sloshed.” Air India has barred him from flying for 30 days, pending action to be decided by an independent panel like the first peegate the airline had seen in Nov 2022.Cabin crew “provided assistance” to the victim — who declined to file a complaint against the passenger after he apologised profusely — and shifted the latter to another seat on the erstwhile Vistara A320 which has 2 by 2 seating in business. In Nov 2022, a business class passenger on AI’s New York-Delhi flight had urinated on an elderly lady in the same cabin class.“Air India confirms that an incident of unruly passenger behaviour was reported to the cabin crew operating flight AI-2336, from Delhi to Bangkok, on April 9, 2025. The crew followed all laid down procedures, and the matter has been reported to the authorities. In addition to warning the unruly passenger, our crew offered to assist an aggrieved passenger to take up a grievance with authorities in Bangkok, which was declined at the time,” an Air India spokesperson said.“The standing independent committee will be convened to assess the incident and determine the action, if any, to be taken against the unruly passenger. AI continues to follow the standard operating procedures as laid out by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in such matters,” the spokesperson added.AI-2336 had taken off from Delhi just after 2 am on Wednesday and landed in Bangkok a little over four hours later. “He urinated just before landing. The aircraft lavs were functional. The crew had offered to help the victim in filing a complaint with the authorities on arrival in Bangkok but he declined to do so. Now the internal panel will decide on the course of action to be taken against the person who urinated,” said sources.In the earlier case on AI’s New York-Delhi flight, the person who had urinated was first barred from flying AI for 30 days and then put on the no-fly list for four months. Delhi Police had lodged a case against him under various sections and he was arrested in Bengaluru. He later lost his corporate job.Since that case, AI has become stricter with its liquor service policy. It put emphasis on cabin crew training to help them better recognise and manage possible cases of intoxication. Before the Nov 2022 peegate case, full service Indian carriers that fly abroad like Air India, and earlier erstwhile Jet Airways , were far more liberal in liquor service than their foreign counterparts, especially western carriers. That changed after the earlier urination case.On budget airlines, passengers have to buy liquor on board but even there crew was asked to generally limit sales to two drinks to avoid unruly behaviour by someone getting sloshed. LCC crew sell more only if a passenger seems to be in complete control of him/herself after two drinks on a case-to-case basis, said sources.Flights between India (especially north India Delhi) and Thailand are particularly known for rowdy behaviour by passengers “who are too happy to be going on vacation on the way out or too sad after the same is over and returning home,” say crew members. For instance, low cost AI Express had seen one of its highest ever liquor sales on its inaugural Surat-Bangkok last Dec.","Business class passenger seated in the second row of an air india airbus a320 flying from delhi to bangkok wednesday urinated on a traveller in the front row, just before landing.

NEW Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday slammed the Centre regarding delays in establishing a cashless medical treatment scheme for motor accident victims. The court summoned the road transport ministry secretary for clarification.Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan noted non-compliance with their January 8 order.""The time granted has expired on March 15, 2025. This is a serious breach and violation of not only orders of this court but a violation of implementing a very beneficial legislation. We direct the secretary, ministry of road transport and highways to appear on video-conferencing and explain why the directions of this court were not complied with,"" stated the bench.The court observed that senior government officials respond seriously only upon being summoned.Additional solicitor general Vikramjeet Banerjee , representing the Centre, cited ""bottle necks"" as reasons.The court responded firmly, stating that the legislation was meant to benefit common people and prevent loss of lives due to lack of cashless treatment facilities. They warned of potential contempt proceedings.The secretary was instructed to appear on April 28 for explanation.The court additionally instructed the transport department secretary to provide written directives to district magistrates regarding uploading hidden hit-and-run claims on the GIC portal.On January 8, the court had directed the Centre to create a scheme for cashless treatment during the 'golden hour' as per law.Referencing Section 162(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act , 1988, the government was ordered to implement the scheme by March 14.The Act defines golden hour under Section 2 (12-A) as the crucial one-hour period post-trauma when medical intervention is most effective.The court emphasised that financial and procedural delays often result in fatalities.It highlighted the Centre's statutory obligation under Section 162 to create a cashless treatment scheme, supporting Article 21's right to life guarantee.The law requires insurance companies to provide treatment for accident victims during the golden hour according to the MV Act scheme.Despite being effective from April 1, 2022, the scheme remained unimplemented, necessitating court intervention.The Centre proposed a draft limiting treatment cost to Rs 1.5 lakh for seven days, which the petitioner's counsel deemed inadequate.The GIC was assigned to manage hit-and-run compensation claims and develop a streamlined portal. This portal would facilitate document uploads, notify states of deficiencies, and reduce processing delays. As of July 31, 2024, 921 hit-and-run compensation claims remained pending due to documentation issues. The court directed GIC to resolve these matters.GIC was instructed to complete portal development and report compliance by March 14, 2025.","Justices abhay s oka and ujjal bhuyan noted non-compliance with their january 8 order.
