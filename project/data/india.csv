SRINAGAR: With the tourism sector in Kashmir hit hard by the Pahalgam terror attack, hoteliers and other stakeholders have sought the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , and also plan to reach out to policymakers and influencers.Tourists had cancelled their bookings in Kashmir in large numbers following the massacre of 26 people at Pahalgam’s Baisaran valley on April 22.Mushtaq Chaya, chairman of J&K Hoteliers Club, on Monday said in Srinagar that PM Modi’s voice is most important to bring life again to the tourism sector in Kashmir Valley. He said tourist associations will seek an appointment with the PM, and will request him to appeal to the countrymen to visit the Valley.He also welcomed the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, calling it a wise decision. Expressing hope of resumption of flights to Srinagar soon, he said this will ensure tourism flow. He made a fervent appeal to tourists from across the country to visit Kashmir, saying the situation has now stabilised and they should experience the beauty and hospitality of the Valley once again.Chaya further said that hoteliers in J&K will be inviting prominent YouTubers, influencers, writers and policy makers across the country, and will ask them to post their views and reviews. He said social media influencers have played a positive role, and will be given special facilities to project Kashmir.The hoteliers will also meet J&K LG Manoj Sinha and chief minister Omar Abdullah, and will urge them to announce special packages for tourists and take steps to restore their confidence, Chaya said.On a travel advisory issued by the US on May 7, asking its citizens to avoid visiting J&K, Chaya asserted that domestic tourists were “more than enough”.Kashmir had seen a huge surge in tourism last year, with nearly 35 lakh people visiting the UT, including 5.11 lakh Amarnath pilgrims. The relative peace in the past few years has seen huge investment in the tourism economy, especially in the construction of guest houses and hotels, with locals in even remote areas converting their homes into home stays and tourist facilities.Chaya said 30 lakh Kashmiris are at present involved directly in the tourism sector, and 3 lakh of them are directly working in hotels and other tourism related businesses. He said the hotels have not removed any employee, and are hopeful that tourists will return to Kashmir.","Tourists had cancelled their bookings in kashmir in large numbers following the massacre of 26 people at pahalgam’s baisaran valley on april 22.

"Cash disappearance: Justice Varma’s personal secretary, staff suspected",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cash-disappearance-justice-varmas-personal-secretary-staff-suspected/articleshow/121092411.cms,"Justice Varma (File photo)

NEW DELHI: A high-level judicial panel, inquiring into the discovery of a huge amount of cash at the official residence of HC judge Yashwant Varma on March 14 night, in its report to CJI Sanjiv Khanna has suspected the judge’s personal staff for the mysterious disappearance of the cash.The inquiry panel comprising Punjab and Haryana chief justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC’s Justice Anu Sivaraman recorded the statements of the judge’s private secretary and staff, security personnel posted at his residence as well as fire and police personnel on the fire incident at the Tughlaq Crescent bungalow, the official residence of then Delhi HC judge Varma.All personnel among the first responders were unequivocal that they made videos of burning cash as well as sacks of cash untouched by the leaping flames of the fire that broke out at the storeroom within the judge’s residential premises and left the place without seizing any of the cash, either burnt or unburnt.Delhi HC Chief Justice D K Upadhyay, on being informed about the incident by the Delhi Police commissioner at 4.50pm on March 15, had instructed his registrar-cum-secretary to visit Justice Varma’s residence and inspect the place of fire. On reaching the residence, he was taken to Justice Varma by the latter’s private secretary.Justice Varma took the CJ’s secretary to the room, which was adjacent to the judge’s official residence. He found that though burnt articles and debris were in the room, there was no sign of any cash, burnt or unburnt.The inquiry panel recorded that the fire service was alerted by police, who got the first call about the incident at the judge’s residence at 11.35pm on March 14.They reached the spot at 11.43pm, doused the fire and left the scene at 1.56am on March 15. The panel also found that shortly thereafter police personnel, who videographed the incident, also left the house, leaving behind the cash as it were in the room. Security personnel posted at the judge’s residence informed the panel that Justice Varma’s private secretary and personal staff stayed back. The panel said it is prima facie of the opinion that the cash disappeared from the room in the early hours of March 15 and that the fire scene was cleared of all burnt and unburnt notes, which could not have been done without the knowledge and involvement of the judge’s private secretary and personal staff.However, the panel said it would require a formal investigation to summon witnesses and record their statements, which cannot be done by the informal inquiry panel as it had not been conferred with powers to probe as per the criminal procedure code. It is to be seen whether Delhi HC initiates any disciplinary proceedings against the judge’s private secretary based on the inquiry panel’s prima facie findings.CJI Khanna had forwarded the inquiry report to Justice Varma seeking his response and with a suggestion that he should quit judgeship. Justice Varma refused to quit, forcing the CJI to send the inquiry report along with the judge’s response to the President and the PM for formal initiation of a removal motion against him.Justice Varma was repatriated from Delhi HC to Allahabad HC, his parent high court, immediately after the constitution of the inquiry panel and has been stripped of judicial work.","A high-level judicial panel, inquiring into the discovery of a huge amount of cash at the official residence of hc judge yashwant varma on march 14 night, has suspected the judge’s personal staff for the mysterious disappearance of the cash.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121092433,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-375862,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

The untold truth of Kayla Nicole and Travis Kelce's breakup: Pet custody and the financial responsibility



There Were So Many RED FLAGS in Travis Kelce & Kayla Nicole's Relationship 🚩

Travis Kelce fires back at pet custody claims



When the headlines were buzzing about Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, the world almost forgot that the Kansas City Chiefs star had an entirely different romantic chapter before he became a pop culture sensation with Swift. That chapter was with Kayla Nicole , a successful sports journalist, entrepreneur, and media personality. After a five-year on-and-off relationship, Kelce and Nicole parted ways in 2022 just as his connection with Swift caught fire. But now, in her newly launched podcast, “The Pre-Game with Kayla Nicole,” the media personality is revisiting the past with a candid, controversial take on her breakup, particularly her experience with the pet custody battle that followed.In a recent episode of her podcast, Nicole opened up about an issue that often gets overlooked in the aftermath of high-profile relationships, the responsibility of caring for shared pets. During her conversation with guest Nazanin Mandi, Nicole didn’t mince words when discussing her experience with her two dogs, Chauncey and Rambo, whom she shared with Kelce. According to Nicole, she’s the one who’s had to bear the full financial burden for their well-being post-breakup.“I have dogs with the previous partner, and I got both the dog’s responsibility on me,” she said. “I had a dog bill the other day; it was $2,000.” That’s a hefty price for the care of beloved pets, and one that Kelce seemingly hasn’t shared, despite his wealth and status. This revelation comes after previous whispers about Kelce’s reluctance to contribute financially during their relationship, especially when it came to their dogs’ vet care.But Kelce himself, known for his brash humor and confidence, has disputed these claims. In 2023, on The Pivot Podcast, Kelce fired back at allegations that he was “too cheap” to help with their pets’ expenses. “How crazy is that?” he said, dismissing the rumors as nonsense. He clarified that while he may not have financially supported Nicole in the way some people might expect, he certainly contributed in other ways. “You got to be crazy, if you think I've never helped or gave her a couple dollars to grab some food,” he explained.So, what’s the truth? Does Kelce, one of the NFL’s highest-paid players, truly live up to his generous persona, or has Nicole been left holding the bag when it comes to taking care of the dogs they once shared? While Kelce denies the claims, Nicole’s statement paints a different picture, raising questions about the responsibility of pet ownership post-relationship, especially when there’s money and fame involved.Also Read: Micah Parsons reacts to underdog label before Cowboys vs Eagles opener At the end of the day,when love fades, the complexities of shared responsibilities don’t disappear.

Priya Saxena vs Kristi Noem







28-year-old doctoral student from India Priya Saxena received two degrees from South Dakota School of Mines & Technology -- a doctorate in chemical and biological engineering and a master's degree in chemical engineering. Since last month, Saxena has been on the deportation list of the homeland security department though she did not take part in any campus protests. Saxena came to the news as she sued the department and its head Kristi Noem.In 2021, Sazena was convicted for failing to move over for flashing yellow lights. Citing this incident, the DHS said her student visa should be revoked though her visa is not scheduled to expire until 2027.Saxena's graduation ceremony in which she was conferred with the title 'Dr' was called the ultimate revenge because Kristo Noem, too, received an honorary degree from Dakota itself, but there were no cheers for her, unlike Dr Saxena. Instead, she faced protests when she accepted the degree on stage in South Dakota.Saxena and her attorney Jim Leach sued Kristi Noem and won a temporary restraining order until Saxena's graduation.Her attorney argued in court that she did not commit a deportable offence. They also said that Priya declared the misdemeanor charge before applying for her next visa. Her next hearing is tomorrow.Kristi Noem was conferred with an honorary doctorate in public service by Dakota State University which is Noem' alma mater.
