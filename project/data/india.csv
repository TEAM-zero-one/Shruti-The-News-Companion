Let judge who convicted J&K separatist decide sentence: NIA court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/let-judge-who-convicted-jk-separatist-decide-sentence-nia-court/articleshow/127873673.cms,"Representative image

A special NIA court in Delhi on Monday transferred the case against Kashmiri separatist Aasiya Andrabi back to the judge who had convicted her on terror charges under UAPA and for IPC offences as well, holding that the “judge who delivered the conviction must also decide the sentencing”.Special Judge Chanderjit Singh was transferred from the NIA court to the Karkardooma courts in Nov 2025 but as the judgment in the case was pending, he took the case file with him for pronouncing the verdict.On Monday, special judge (NIA) Prashant Sharma noted that Judge Chanderjit Singh, though now posted at Karkardooma Courts, had “extensively heard” the matter, including final arguments, and had “examined the record threadbare” before convicting the accused on Jan 15.Judge Sharma recorded that he joined the NIA court after Nov 20, 2025, whereas Judge Singh had been hearing the case since 2024 and pronounced the guilty verdict on Jan 14. Sharma also noted he received the case file only after Jan 16, by which time final arguments had already been concluded before Judge Singh.The Delhi high court , in an order dated July 15, 2025, had ruled judges who reserve judgments must pronounce them within weeks of their transfer.Andrabi who founded the all-women separatist group Dukhtaraan-e-Millat (DeM) in 1987, was arrested in April 2018. The group was subsequently banned.",Aasiya andrabi founded the all-women separatist group dukhtaraan-e-millat (dem) in 1987.

Ram Rahim plea: HC resumes hearing in journo murder case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ram-rahim-plea-hc-resumes-hearing-in-journo-murder-case/articleshow/127873636.cms,"Gurmeet Ram Rahim

CHANDIGARH: Citing the “emergence of new facts”, Punjab and Haryana HC has resumed hearing in the Ram Chander Chhatrapati murder case, more than four months after reserving its verdict on the appeal filed by Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim and others.“The appeals have been finally heard on Sept 25, 2025. However, while dictating the judgment, some new facts have emerged, which require further clarification for proper adjudication of the matter,” a division bench comprising Chief Justice Sheel Nagu and Justice Vikram Aggarwal observed in its order released on Jan 30, while starting re-hearing of the matter.On Jan 17, 2019, a special CBI court in Panchkula had sentenced the Dera chief and three others to life imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 for the 2002 murder of Sirsa-based journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati, editor of ‘Poora Sach’ newspaper.The Dera chief challenged the conviction before HC, claiming that he had been falsely implicated by CBI as the first chargesheet against other accused, Nirmal, Kuldeep and Krishan Lal, had already been filed and none of them had alleged his involvement in the conspiracy.Counsel for Gurmeet Ram Rahim contended that he was not named in the first chargesheet filed by police in 2002 and that his name was included in it “by way of revenge”.“The investigating agency failed to prove that the appellant ever read the said newspaper (Poora Sach). As per the prosecution’s own story, it was an evening newspaper and only reported news that had already been published by the morning newspapers. There was, thus, no question of the appellant having any grudge against the deceased,” the Dera chief’s petition stated.",Punjab and haryana hc has resumed hearing in the ram chander chhatrapati murder case.

LUCKNOW: VHP demanded Monday a ban on entry of non-Hindus at major temples in UP, including Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya, Kashi Vishwanath Dham in Varanasi and Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura, widening a simmering national debate over religious sanctity and public access.VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal said Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains could be exempted, contending their faiths originated in India. He alleged attempts by “ill-intentioned” non-Hindus to enter temples. On Jan 10, a 55-year-old man from J&K, identified as Ahmed Sheikh, was detained after allegedly attempting to offer namaz inside Ram Janmabhoomi temple complex. Family members said he was not mentally sound.VHP’s demand follows similar moves in Uttarakhand, where temple committees of Gangotri and Badrinath-Kedarnath have announced plans to bar non-Hindus from shrines starting with upcoming Char Dham Yatra season, after portals of Gangotri and Yamunotri reopen in April. Bansal said temples were places of worship, not tourist attractions. “The temples are not tourist spots for making reels. They are meant for worship,” he said, adding the ban should be strictly enforced to restrict the entry of people whom he described as “anasthawan” (non-believers).Pressure to restrict access has also come from Haridwar, where Ganga Sabha, a trust managing religious affairs of ghats, has demanded a ban on non-Hindus at 2027 Kumbh Mela.","Vhp demands ban on entry of non-hindus at major temples in up.

KASARAGOD: Fresh parole to a convict in Kerala’s Periya double-murder case reignited political outrage, with Congress-headed opposition boycotting the assembly on Monday after the speaker blocked an urgent debate over repeated releases of prisoners.The case involves the 2019 political killing of Youth Congress workers Kripesh and Sarath Lal in Periya, a village in Kasaragod district in northern Kerala. CPM workers were convicted and handed double life terms by a trial court.Tenth accused Ranjith T was granted 15-day parole Monday, barely two-and-a-half months after similar relief earlier. Prime convict A Peethambaran and another convict, Gijin, are also out on parole, drawing sharp criticism and scrutiny of prison rules. Kannur jail authorities said parole followed jail rules. In Sept 2025, three CPM workers were given 30 days’ parole.Tension spilled into the assembly. RMP MLA K K Rema sought an adjournment motion alleging procedures were violated in granting parole to CPM workers. Speaker AN Shamseer rejected the motion.Opposition members shouted slogans, accusing the speaker of shielding LDF govt. Opposition leader VD Satheesan of Congress questioned the rejection and cited VK Nishad, sentenced to 20 years for a bomb attack on police, who was granted parole within a month of conviction.

NEW DELHI: Jailed activist Sonam Wangchuk was taken to AIIMS Jodhpur for a medical examination on Saturday after the Supreme Court sought his medical report by February 2.The 59-year-old former educationist was examined for about 90 minutes before being escorted back to prison. He has reportedly been suffering from stomach-related ailments and had also visited the hospital on Friday for medical tests.Wangchuk has been raising concerns about his deteriorating health in jail for some time. Taking note of his worsening condition, the Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Jodhpur jail administration to arrange a medical examination by a specialist.The top court is hearing a writ petition filed by his wife, Geetanjali Angmo, challenging his detention under the stringent National Security Act.Wangchuk has been lodged in Rajasthan's Jodhpur Central Jail since September 27 last year, three days after a protest demanding statehood for his native Ladakh turned violent in Leh, the Union territory's capital.During Thursday’s hearing, a bench comprising Justices Arvind Kumar and PB Varale instructed jail authorities to ensure that Wangchuk is examined by a specialist doctor—a gastroenterologist—at a government hospital.Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj, appearing for the Rajasthan government, informed the bench that jail doctors had examined Wangchuk 21 times over the past four months, with the most recent check-up conducted on January 26.However, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing Wangchuk, objected to the submission, stating that his client was suffering from persistent stomach pain, allegedly caused by the quality of water provided in jail.Accepting the argument, the court observed that medical treatment by a specialist must be provided in accordance with the patient’s needs.",Sonam wangchuk was taken to aiims jodhpur for a medical examination on saturday.

'Nothing For Bengal': Mamata Banerjee Attacks 'Humpty Dumpty' Union Budget 2026 As Markets Tumble

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has approached the Supreme Court challenging the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in the poll-bound state, PTI reported on Sunday.Banerjee filed the petition on January 28, naming the Election Commission of India (ECI) and the chief electoral officer of West Bengal as respondents. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo had earlier announced on January 3 her intention to move the top court against the exercise.The petition is yet to be listed for hearing. The Supreme Court is already seized of multiple petitions related to the SIR, including those filed by TMC MPs.Earlier, Banerjee had written to chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar, urging him to halt what she described as an “arbitrary and flawed” revision of electoral rolls in the state, where assembly elections are expected in April–May.Escalating her criticism of the ECI, she warned that continuing the SIR in its present form could lead to “mass disenfranchisement” and undermine the “foundations of democracy.”In a strongly worded letter dated January 3, Banerjee accused the poll body of conducting an “unplanned, ill-prepared and ad hoc” process riddled with “serious irregularities, procedural violations, and administrative lapses.”","West bengal chief minister mamata banerjee has approached the supreme court.

Sanjay Raut Raises Doubts Over Ajit Pawar Plane Crash, Seeks Thorough Probe

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut on Monday raised serious doubts over the sudden and “suspicious” death of NCP chief and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, saying “something is dubious” and calling for a thorough investigation into the plane crash that killed the leader last week in Baramati.Drawing a parallel with the death of Justice Loya, Raut asked, “Did someone do something here?” while questioning the circumstances surrounding the crash.Speaking to news agency ANI, Raut said questions were bound to arise given Ajit Pawar’s political stature. “The manner in which a leader like Ajit Pawar, a tall leader of Maharashtra, died in a plane crash and the facts which are coming to light - it should be investigated, I think there is something dubious here. These questions are being raised by Ajit dada's party. His death is suspicious. Something did happen behind the curtains,” he said.Raut claimed that Ajit Pawar was keen to reunite the two factions of the Nationalist Congress Party and had initiated talks with his uncle and party founder Sharad Pawar in the final phase of his life.He alleged that some people were opposed to this reconciliation, as it would have “shut their shops”.The Sena (UBT) leader further alleged that Ajit Pawar had expressed his desire to “return home” politically and that this move had unsettled certain sections.Referring to past controversies, Raut claimed Pawar had faced pressure over the irrigation scam case days before his death.“Ajit dada had said that he wants to 'return home', after that the people of BJP threatened him with Sinchan Scam files. Ajit Pawar then responded to them over the same Sinchan Scam files. He died mysteriously within 10 days of that. What do we understand from this? This reminds us of Justice Loya. Did someone do something here?” Raut asked.However, NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar has urged people to not politicise the death of his nephew Ajit Pawar.Also read: Ajit Pawar’s son Parth Pawar breaks down while holding father’s chair at NCP office in Mumbai Ajit Pawar died when his aircraft crashed near Baramati last Wednesday.

LUCKNOW: Gold buys food. In eastern Uttar Pradesj, food brought gold. For a 12-year-old schoolboy, an offer of unlimited free momos was worth more than the metal locked in a family cupboard. For two roadside vendors, the boy’s craving turned into a gold mine.Police said the class 7 student handed over jewellery worth Rs 85 lakh from his family home to momo sellers near Dumari Chauraha in Deoria — about 350km east of Lucknow — trading ornaments for what he was promised would be a lifetime supply of free dumplings. The trail surfaced when jewellery vanished from the cupboard. The boy’s mother and aunt went looking. The cupboard was empty. Questions followed. The child broke down and told his father he had traded the valuables for “unlimited free food for a lifetime”.According to a complaint filed by the boy’s father, a temple priest, the child had grown fond of momo sold at the roadside stall.The vendors allegedly began feeding him free of cost, winning trust bite by bite. Soon came bigger offers — food, small sums of money, loyalty.Then persuasion. Unaware of the stakes, the boy began removing jewellery from home and handing it over, police said.Gold necklaces. Rings. Bangles. Mangtika. Nose pins. Earrings. Silver toe rings. Family heirlooms, one snack at a time. The vendors vanished soon enough.The priest approached police on Feb 1, alleging the momo sellers threatened the child with dire consequences to keep him silent. Police teams are now searching for the two fugitives and tracing the jewellery trail, SHO Devendra Kumar Singh said, adding legal action will follow. Other suspects are also being questioned.",Police said the class 7 student handed over jewellery worth rs 85 lakh from his family home to momo sellers.

'Arrogant, Liar': Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee Attacks CEC Gyanesh After SIR Meet In Delhi

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Monday rejected West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee ’s allegations against Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar.ECI sources claimed the Trinamool Congress leader “raised false allegations, misbehaved, thumped the table and left” during a meeting on the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls.According to news agency ANI citing sources, CEC Gyanesh Kumar responded to the queries raised by Banerjee, who led a party delegation to the Election Commission and explained that the rule of law would prevail throughout the SIR process.“The CEC responded to her queries and explained that rule of law shall prevail and anybody taking law into their own hands shall be dealt with strictly as per the provisions of law and powers vested in the Commission,” according to sources.The source added that despite “polite posture” of the CEC and the two other Election Commissioners, Banerjee allegedly behaved in an inappropriate manner. “The Trinamool Congress leader raised false allegations, misbehaved, thumped the table and left,” it claimed.ECI sources also alleged that TMC leaders and legislators have been targeting election officials in West Bengal. It alleged that TMC MLAs are openly using abusive and threatening language against the Election Commission and especially against the CEC.“There have been incidents of vandalisation of the ERO (SDO/BDO) offices by TMC workers and MLAs,” the source alleged.The poll body further stressed that officers involved in the SIR process must be allowed to function without pressure. “No pressure, obstruction, or interference of any kind by anyone should be exerted on officers engaged in work concerning the Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls,” the sources said.The Election Commission also raised administrative concerns, stating that honorarium for Booth Level Officers (BLOs) had not been fully paid. “Only Rs 7,000 out of Rs 18,000 per BLO has been paid so far,” a source said, adding that payments should be released without delay.The sources further said that the EROs and AEROs deployed in the state were not of the required rank. They highlighted that the Commission had sought proposals for the appointment of Returning Officers on January 20 as per prescribed criteria, but only 67 Assembly constituencies currently have ROs of the rank of SDO or SDM.The ECI also alleged procedural lapses by the West Bengal government, including the transfer of three Electoral Roll Observers without consulting the Commission. “The ECI requested cancellation of the transfer orders on January 27, but no action has been reported so far,” a source said.Additionally, the poll body claimed that no FIR had been registered against four election officers, two EROs and two AEROs and one Data Entry Operator for their failure to perform their statutory duties and for violating data security policies by sharing log-in credentials with unauthorised persons.Earlier in the day, Banerjee had sharply attacked the CEC while speaking to reporters outside the Election Commission office. “I am very sad. I have been involved in politics in Delhi for a very long time. I was a minister four times and an MP seven times. I have never seen such an Election Commissioner who is so arrogant, who is such a liar,” she alleged.The West Bengal chief minister accused the poll body of selectively targeting her state and questioned the deletion of voters’ names. “Why Bengal is being targeted? Elections are a festival in a democracy, but you deleted the names of 58 lakh people and did not allow them to defend themselves,” she said.The confrontation comes ahead of Assembly elections in West Bengal, scheduled to be held in the first half of this year and amid heightened political tension over the ongoing nationwide SIR exercise, which is currently under way in 12 states and union territories.

'Arrogant, Liar': Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee Attacks CEC Gyanesh After SIR Meet In Delhi

NEW DELHI: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Monday stormed out of a meeting with CEC Gyanesh Kumar over the SIR of electoral roll issue in her state, alleging EC “humiliated and insulted” the TMC delegation and that it was BJP’s “dalal”.Talking to reporters later in front of Nirvachan Sadan — where a heavy police posse had gathered — she claimed to have warned the CEC that he will end up like Jagdeep Dhankhar, seen as a reference to the former VP’s sudden resignation last year.She was accompanied by party national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, MP Kalyan Banerjee, and 12 members from what they claimed were “SIR-affected families” from Bengal.They all wore black shawls. The party has submitted a memorandum listing out its concerns to EC.Reiterating her allegation that over 150 people have died due to SIR, Banerjee said she brought “100 people to Delhi of which 50 have lost a family member due to SIR and 50 have been marked dead despite being alive”.She said the delegation walked out of the meeting in protest. She said she had come to meet EC with the hope of getting justice, but that did not happen.Responses of EC to TMC’s concerns were “bluff and garbage of lies”, she alleged.“EC has to take responsibility for the deaths that have happened due to SIR,” Mamata said. On what she expected from EC going forward, she said, “We have no expectation... they (EC) are BJP’s dalal, dalal, dalal.”“I have not seen a CEC like him. He is arrogant and a liar. I told him we respect your chair, but no chair is permanent for anybody. One day you have to go. Don’t create this precedent. Why only Bengal is being targeted?” she said.She alleged the CEC said whatever he did was right. “EC is acting on directions of BJP. Dhankhar also did this,” Mamata said. On SIR in Bengal, she said, “You (EC) are not doing inclusion; you are doing deletion. After removing 58 lakh voters, you plan to remove another 1.4 crore voters. So, you have put 2 crore voters under mismatch category.”Attacking BJP, she said “this is how you won... through manipulation in Bihar, Haryana and Maharashtra”. “But TMC is strong. If we want, I can bring lakhs of people to Delhi,” she added.","West bengal cm mamata banerjee stormed out of a meeting with cec gyanesh kumar over the sir of electoral roll issue in her state.

JAMMU: J&K’s governing National Conference (NC) on Monday urged BJP to move beyond demands for a National Law University (NLU) in Jammu and instead press the Centre to restore statehood to the Union territory.Surinder Choudhary, deputy chief minister in the Omar Abdullah-led govt, accused BJP of raising the NLU issue as part of its claims about discrimination against Jammu while remaining silent on larger concerns.“They (BJP) wake up every morning and start shouting that the Omar govt is discriminating against Jammu,” NC’s Choudhary said on the opening day of the J&K assembly’s 27-day budget session in Jammu.J&K has no NLU at present but the demand for it to be located in Jammu gained traction after CM Omar said last year that it would come up in Kashmir’s Budgam. Omar has rejected the recent BJP demands, calling the controversy “politically motivated” and pointing out that there were no protests in the Valley when Jammu was given both an IIT and an IIM.Deputy CM Choudhary stressed that J&K faced far more pressing issues than NLU and accused BJP of abandoning its promise of restoring statehood. “Why is he not asking the Centre to fulfil the promise of statehood,” Choudhary said.He was referring to Sunil Sharma, BJP leader of opposition who joined students’ protests at Jammu University over the NLU.A legislator from Jammu’s Nowshera, Choudhary rejected allegations of discrimination, arguing the NC govt would not have revived the “Darbar Move” after four years if that was the case.In June 2021, LG Sinha’s administration ended the Darbar Move, a 149-year-old practice of shifting the seat of govt between Srinagar and Jammu every six months. Sinha described the system as “a big racket”. Before its abolition, over 10,000 state employees shuttled between the two cities twice a year, boosting trade and commerce in Jammu. The Omar-led govt resumed it this year after demands from Jammu’s traders, who said its suspension had hurt business.Referring to the NLU demand, deputy CM Choudhary flagged “lack of statehood” as the biggest issue, leading to local jobs being taken away by “outsiders”. “BJP has a habit of sitting on roads and accusing the govt of discrimination. But they don’t look at Jammu University, where not a single vice-chancellor has been from Jammu. Are our professors from Jammu not capable of leading the university? But BJP will not talk about it,” Choudhary said.",J&k’s governing national conference (nc) on monday urged bjp to move beyond demands for a national law university (nlu) in jammu.

NASHIK: The Jalgaon health department cancelled nearly 3,000 delayed birth and death certificates after it found they were generated illegally, and reported the matter to the state govt.Dr Sachin Bhayekar, the district health officer, said the administration, at the beginning of Jan 2026, received information that illegal delayed birth and death certificates were generated and delivered from Bhatpuri village in Parola taluka. Subsequently, an investigation was launched.“Upon going through the details, the district administration found that since 2016, when the online process for registration began, a user ID was generated for Bhatpuri, a far-flung village, but it was never used. However, at least 4,907 delayed birth and death certificates were generated from the village,” the officer said. The matter came to light after the administration got an alert from the Yavatmal district administration about several certificates being generated from Bhatpuri.It was found the certificates were issued for the period 2010 to 2025, and they were all processed during Nov-Dec 2025. “The names in whose favour the certificates were generated included the likes of Sarita Devi and Gopal Das, and some Muslim-sounding names.However, Patil, Mahajan, Bhil, etc, are the common surnames of people who live around this area. The investigation also covered the neighbouring village of Ratale but, there too, people with such names/surnames were not found,” Bhayekar said.The district administration conducted a thorough investigation and found that there was no record of these names. The health department raised the issue with state govt and informed the state registrar. Following directives from the state registrar, the health department started cancelling the certificates. So far, close to 3,000 certificates have been cancelled. The entire process will be completed in a week’s time.Bhayekar said a special investigation team was set up at the district level. An FIR was also registered against unknown people.","The jalgaon health department cancelled nearly 3,000 delayed birth and death certificates.

MUMBAI: Monday saw claims and counter-claims about meetings to plan a merger between the two NCP groups — with Sharad Pawar ’s faction confirming the meetings and more voices in Ajit Pawar’s outfit denying them. Pawar Sr, meanwhile, hit back at CM Devendra Fadnavis over his statement that Ajit Pawar would have informed him if there were merger talks. Pawar Sr informally told journalists that those who were not present at the meetings would not know what transpired.NCP MP and state president Sunil Tatkare asked on Monday, “We had taken a collective decision to join the BJP-led NDA and people of the state have stamped their approval of Ajit dada’s decision in the 2024 assembly elections. Those speaking of a merger should answer whether they are fine with it.”NCP minister Chhagan Bhujbal agreed with the view that if merger talks were serious, BJP would have been informed. “Today, Sunetra Pawar is the deputy CM. She will speak to others and come to a decision.”“We are with the BJP govt and with NDA. If such talks were held, BJP would have to be informed and decisions would have to be taken about who would be part of NDA at the Centre,” Bhujbal said.He added Ajit Pawar had not informed him about any merger talks. NCP minister Hasan Mushrif also said he was not present at any of the talks. “As far as I know, there was no meeting in which leaders of both parties were present.”But NCP (SP)’s Jitendra Awhad said, “It is 2000% true that merger talks were on.”","Sharad pawar ’s faction confirms the meetings and more voices in ajit pawar’s outfit deny them.

INDORE: What a mother hears, the child remembers — or so the epics say. Abhimanyu learned how to breach a battle formation before he was born. Madhya Pradesh is turning that belief into policy with Garbh Sanskar rooms planned across govt hospitals to “educate the mind of the fetus”.These dedicated spaces are meant to guide expectant parents through prenatal care rooted in traditional Indian practices, from positive thinking and lifestyle discipline to diet and emotional well-being. The idea: shape the mind of the unborn.CM Mohan Yadav announced the initiative Sunday in Indore, placing it under the Ayushman Bharat scheme and linking it to the Union ministry of Ayush.The programme promises “structured prenatal guidance aimed at holistic foetal development”, blending Ayurveda with modern medicine. Speaking at the Divya Santan Prakalp (Divine Child Project) event, Yadav framed Garbh Sanskar as a long-term investment. “This is about nurturing a physically, mentally and ethically strong future generation,” he said. “It combines scientific understanding with India’s traditional knowledge systems. ”Future govt hospital designs will mandatorily include Garbh Sanskar rooms, he said, signalling a shift in how public healthcare approaches pregnancy.Yadav said allopathy practitioners are increasingly recognising the value of comprehensive prenatal care, while the state continues to promote normal deliveries and strengthen maternal and child health infrastructure. To underline the belief behind the project, the CM reached into the epics. Abhimanyu and Ashtavakra symbolise how learning and values can be absorbed in the womb, he said. The pandemic showed the power of integrated healthcare, where Ayurveda and allopathy worked side by side, he added.He also pointed to the scientific relevance of rural lifestyles, indigenous diets and traditional Indian kitchens.Officials said the programme will counsel couples on nutrition, mental health, emotional bonding and prenatal practices, positioning pregnancy as both a medical and cultural journey. There is, however, an unspoken caveat embedded in the very story driving the idea: mothers must stay awake for the full session. Abhimanyu learned how to enter the deadly Chakravyuha while still unborn — but not how to exit. His mother Subhadra fell asleep midway through the lesson. The result was fatal.","Madhya pradesh is turning that belief into policy with garbh sanskar rooms planned across govt hospitals.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday recorded its agreement with a petitioner that mere self-declaration of caste identity by an individual during the proposed caste enumeration in 2027 could not help in accurate determination of SC, ST and OBC population.Appearing for social activist Akash Goel, advocate Mukta Gupta told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that the directorate of census operations, which has commenced preparatory work for Census 2027, has not disclosed “any predetermined criteria or standardised methodology” for recording caste identity of people belonging to SC, ST and OBC categories during census.Since caste-enumeration would play a big role in devising and implementation of social welfare measures, reservations in govt employment and admissions to educational institutions, and delimitation of parliamentary and assembly constituencies, it should be scientifically foolproof in gathering data, the PIL petitioner said.The CJI-led bench said, “In principle we agree with you. But it is the job of the experts, and it is for them to devise the mode and the way caste enumeration is to be carried out.”Though SC did not entertain the plea, it asked Gupta to give the petition in form of representation to directorate of census operations for necessary action. In its order, the bench said, “We have no reasons to doubt that the respondent authorities, with the aid and assistance of domain experts, must have evolved a robust mechanism in order to rule out any mistake (in caste enumeration) as apprehended by the petitioner.“The petitioner has flagged relevant issues through earlier representation. We dispose of the writ petition with a direction to the respondent authorities to consider the suggestions/issues raised by the petitioner,” the court said.","Supreme court recorded its agreement with a petitioner that mere self-declaration of caste identity by an individual during the proposed caste enumeration in 2027 could not help in accurate determination of sc, st and obc population.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127873287,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-113124,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
Parents to be blamed for allowing minors to drink & drive: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parents-to-be-blamed-for-allowing-minors-to-drink-drive-sc/articleshow/127873182.cms,"Pune’s Porsche crash claimed 2 lives

NEW DELHI: Noting that there have been frequent cases of drunk minors snuffing out innocent lives while driving cars, SC Monday said their parents are to be blamed for allowing them to drink and drive. It, however, granted bail to three accused in Pune Porsche accident case in which two young engineers died while a minor was allegedly at the wheel.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan said that there cannot be punishment before trial and directed release of the accused who already spent 18 months in jail. They were allegedly involved in tampering of evidence by swapping blood samples of their kids with their own. Father of the main accused, who is a minor and was allegedly driving the case, is still in jail.SC, however, lamented over prevailing social conditions where well-off parents do not spare time for their children and try to compensate for it by giving them money and lofty gifts like sports cars. It said such parents are to be blamed when their minors crush innocent people on road with their cars.“Something has to be said about parents. Parents were unable to control the children. They took keys. Celebration cannot be driving at full speed and killing people on footpath or the poor. This is not the first time such a thing has happened. Law has to catch up. The main one responsible is parents who give money to kids to have a gala time. Parents have no time to spend with children and talk to them. Instead they give mobile, ATM cards and cars,” the bench observed.The accused moved SC after their bail plea was rejected by Bombay HC. The accident took place around 2.30 am on May 19, 2024, when a Porsche car, allegedly driven by a juvenile in an inebriated state, rammed into a bike in Pune.",Pune’s porsche crash claimed 2 lives while a minor was allegedly at the wheel.

Rottweiler attack leaves Bengaluru woman with over 80 stitches,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rottweiler-attack-leaves-bengaluru-woman-with-over-80-stitches/articleshow/127873091.cms,"Representative photo

BENGALURU: What should have been an ordinary, even joyful, phase of life has been violently upended for 31-year-old Shalini Kumari Dubey, a Bengaluru professional and mother to a 17-month-old toddler.Days that once revolved around work, cuddles and caring for her breastfeeding child are now spent in a hospital bed, recovering from a brutal dog attack that has left her with more than 80 stitches across her face, throat and head — and scars that go far beyond the physical.Early on Jan 26, Shalini had stepped out for morning walk near home in HSR Layout’s Teachers’ Colony.A neighbour’s pet Rottweiler allegedly released onto the road without a leash or muzzle, lunged at her, pinning her to the ground and attacking her face and neck.CCTV footage shows the dog charging at the woman the moment its owner opened the gate.“There was no chain, no muzzle, no safety measures,” said Shalini’s husband Satya Prakash Dubey. Shalini survived, but only just. She underwent nearly eight hours of surgery. One deep wound, 7cm long, was dangerously close to her airway. “Another centimetre and it could have been fatal,” Satya Prakash said.Doctors have warned that some scars may be permanent. Hospitalised for more than a week, Shalini struggles with flashbacks and anxiety and has begun consulting a clinical psychologist.For Shalini, the big worry is whether her young child will recognise her due to her facial injuries. A police complaint was filed after the hospital flagged it as a medico-legal case. An FIR was registered against the dog’s owner, N Amaresh Reddy, for negligence. Neighbours claim the dog had displayed aggressive behaviour earlier as well. Satya Prakash said a delivery executive was once attacked.“There were warnings. The owners ought to have acted back then. This is not about dogs-versus-humans. This is about irresponsible ownership. My wife’s life changed forever. No family should go through this,” Satya Prakash said.","Shalini kumari dubey, 31, is a mother to a 17-month-old toddler.
