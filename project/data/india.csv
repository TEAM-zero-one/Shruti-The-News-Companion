Why modern Simrans are giving up on Raj,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-modern-simrans-are-giving-up-on-raj/articleshow/124681434.cms,".

Bhattacharya is an economist and author of ‘Desperately Seeking Shah Rukh’

Thirty years of ‘Diwale Dulhania Le Jayenge’, the film that invited a subset of urbane women to ‘come fall in love’. My qualifications to trace its journey involve being an accidental chronicler of the economics and mathematics of Shah Rukh Khan and his female fans. For fifteen years, I thought I was interviewing women about how they saw Khan. Instead, I discovered how these women saw themselves and their frustrated attempts to find love and livelihoods.Finer minds than mine have dissected every inch of the film; there is thirty years of discourse out there. Stunning photographs of audiences at Maratha Mandir signal how the film continues to offer escape from the drudgery of daily life. For parts of the commentariat, the romance of Raj and Simran captures India's enduring love affair with patriarchy and caste endogamy. After all, Simran can only marry Raj if her father approves. Raj prefers patriarchal permission games to the rebellion of elopement. Familial regulation of women’s bodily autonomy remains at the heart of the plot. None of the women in the film seem to have jobs beyond loving andcaring for men. Simran writes great poetry but possesses no clear profession. Her girl gang and Europe trip looks fun, until a group of entitled boys crashes into it.Raj most certainly meshes harassment with wooing.The film marks the beginning of elite Indians awkwardly managing the pretense of modernity. In post-liberalisation India, with candy floss and GDP growth in the air, here is the fusion of traditional rituals, wealth and retail consumption.So, in its thirtieth year, what does DDLJ mean? I am not brave or foolish enough to make summary pronouncements on how most, or even many women feel about the film. DDLJ may be one movie, but each of us has experienced it in our own unique way. Some of my closest friends have grown up to be cynical about the love story. “He will grow old to be an unhelpful unsexy Uncle”, they say. They surmise that Simran would be better served by revolution than Raj. Others continue to prefer the promise of Raj’s wideopen arms and sanskari happy endings.For some elite urban women like myself, the film is a reminder of the years spent in the captivity of romantic love, hoping to find the One. We were foolish and privileged when we watched DDLJ as teenagers; we are foolish and privileged in our forties. For women our age from the precariat, it was often the first film they recalled watching in a hall or a screening at home or their neighborhoods. Songs from the movie haunted my fieldwork across India; homebased women workers I surveyed had memorised the film’s beautiful soundtrack.Aditya Chopra fashioned a new masculinity through Khan. He raced airplanes, cried beautiful tears, fasted for karwa chauth , broke Preeti’s heart, helped women with housework and sarees. In the second half of the film, Raj transforms into a man who performs emotional and care labour with elegance and elan. Dialogues were equally proportioned between men and women, a rare event in Hindi films.One scene seemed to stir every fan I interviewed. It involved Simran’s mother remarking on how men would never sacrifice their well-being, while women were expected to give up their desires without complaint. She urges the young couple to run away. Simran is willing and raises this option repeatedly, Raj declines. So many women would wonder about Simran’s fate. If she gave up on Raj or gave up on the protection of her family home — where would she go? Would she risk an honour killing? Could she find safe housing? Could she afford to live on her own? Could she bear the loneliness of her revolt? Would the state or market offer credible protection?Since DDLJ’s release in 1995, the times have certainly changed for women, as has the economy. However, the binding constraints on Simran’s horizons remain the same. In 1994, 23% of urban women held paid jobs or were looking for work compared to 80% of urban men. In 2024, the gap remains significant — 76% urban men participated in the labour force compared to 28% women. Public space and the housing market remains odiously masculine. Rates of domestic violence suggest the home is deeply unsafe. Ten percent of our police force is female.A young home-based worker I followed, with a brief history of running away from home, insisted that elopement was the easier choice for men, more so when their fam-ilies supported the match, as was the case in DDLJ. Since intimate violence was assumed as a fact of life, women would always need a safe place to escape. I heard the same explanation from a posh Rajput woman in an abusive marriage. Abandoning the family would make Simran’s ‘fall back’ position weak. Projecting their precarities onto the film’s couple, these women understood Raj as securing Simran a way home should their marriage fall apart. Where earlier all I saw was capitulation and conformity, I began to see bargains and trade-offs. I started to realise that the calculus of rebellion can look very different for women. There are days when a clumsy regressive Raj feels better than liberal men who find no greater joy than lecturing ladies without ever comprehending our bitter constraints.DDLJ marks three decades of women's complicated relationship with their own freedom, the conformist compromises forced upon some, while happily chosen by others. But much like Simran’s mother, I'm impatient now. I have long given up on Raj, the belief that a handsome man can offer happiness. I prefer a political regime that prioritises liberating Simran to fall in love with her own possibilities. I long for the romance of public institutions that credibly care for women's safety and safety nets. Raj can wait. Come fall in love with your freedom. Jee lete hai apni zindagi.","The film marks the beginning of elite indians awkwardly managing the pretense of modernity.

Government to pay bail surety of poor undertrials: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-to-pay-bail-surety-of-poor-undertrials-sc/articleshow/124678809.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Framing a unique standard operating procedure, Supreme Court has directed that if a poor person, arrested for an offence and lodged in jail pending trial, is unable to furnish monetary surety for bail, government concerned through district legal services authority will provide it to ensure release, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra. The new SOP was framed by SC after incorporating suggestions from amicus curiae.The new SOP was framed by a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and S C Sharma after incorporating suggestions from amicus curiae and senior advocate Sidharth Luthra and additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati.The case was taken up suo motu by SC after learning that thousands of undertrials are languishing in jail despite being granted bail just because of their inability to fill bail bonds with or without sureties. The bench said district legal services authority (DLSA) can fill a surety amount up to Rs 1 lakh and if the trial court has fixed it higher than Rs 1 lakh, then it would file an application to get it reduced. In the new guidelines, the bench said if an undertrial prisoner is not released from jail within seven days of grant of bail, then the jail authorities would intimate to DLSA secretary, who will immediately depute a person to verify whether the undertrial has funds in his prisoner’s savings account.If the accused did not have money, then “district level empowered committee will direct release of funds for surety on DLSA’s recommendation within a period of five days from the date of receipt of the report”.“For cases where empowered committee recommends that undertrial prisoner be extended the benefit of financial support under ‘Support to Poor Prisoners Scheme’, then requisite amount of upto Rs 50,000 per case for one prisoner, can be directed to be drawn and made available to court concerned by way of fixed deposit or any other prescribed method, which district committee feels appropriate within five days of its decision pending integration in inter-operable criminal justice system,” SC said.",The new sop was framed by a bench of justices m m sundresh and s c sharma.

Role of GTPRO:

Why GTPRO needed?

Next steps:

The road covered so far

NEW DELHI: The government’s in-principle go ahead to setting up of an apex federal agency for planning and monitoring of all modes of surface transport, railways, shipping, civil aviation and mass transit at national level, and logistics sector is set to bring a paradigm shift in the country’s infrastructure planning and accelerated development. The new entity — GatiShakti Transport Planning and Research Organisation (GTPRO) — to be housed in the Cabinet Secretariat will eliminate at least two layers of project approval process, which take around 60 days.TOI on October 9 had first reported the go ahead given for GTPRO at a meeting chaired by PM Narendra Modi, which was attended by five cabinet ministers and secretaries from related ministries, and other top officials. Sources said DPIIT has been tasked to prepare a proposal for the Cabinet for setting up of the new entity, which will be headed by a senior officer designated as secretary (transport planning).Proposed to be set up under Section-8 of the Companies Act, the GTPRO will include PM GatiShakti framework, logistics and supply chain, transport sector (research and planning), transport big data, project monitoring and impact assessment for all infrastructure projects.The agency would be responsible for roll out of Master Plan or integrated plan; it will appraise sectoral plans such as rail, road and aviation, appraise all projects that cost over Rs 500 crore, monitor projects and assess their impact, and to have a repository of Big Data.The ministries concerned will prepare sector plans for five and 10 years, execute and monitor them as well.Govt expects that the new entity will bring a system of structured framework to initiate master planning and will have datasets that are required for planning and research. It is also expected to put a well placed mechanism for continuous flow of expertise and promote knowledge-sharing in planning.The need to have an Integrated Transport Planning Authority (ITPA) was mooted by three empowered Group of Secretaries in November 2023 and the presentation on transformational change before PM Modi. They had suggested the ITPA could be akin to the establishments in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and Japan to deal with all issues relating to transportation.They had proposed that the new entity would help take the best decisions for creating the right infrastructure keeping in mind the value for money. Then it was envisaged that the agency will coordinate with states for key infrastructure projects. They had proposed integrated transportation solutions with a target to achieve over 42% movement of freight by rail or waterways by 2030. The plan envisaged to increase the average speed of freight trains to 40 kmph by 2030 as compared to the current speed of 24 kmph and also to to increase the average speed of trucks from current 25-40 kmph to more than 40 kmph by 2030.At present, there is no apex agency to deal with transportation issues as a whole in India. Each ministry has its own vision document, there is no brainstorming among ministries and no defined 5-year or 10-year plans. PM Gatishakti National Master Plan has played in project evaluation, but the impact was not as per expectation. There is monitoring by different agencies and by different frameworks while no agency to suggest global best practices, new technologies, no agency to do policy advocacy and recommend changes in Acts and Rules.The government felt the need for transport planning considering that India needs a direction with infrastructure investment, which has been increasing over the past decade. Sources said there is a need for a super specialised expertise in transport planning as China and South Korea.The administration also realised that the current planning is primarily consultant-driven, with minimal collaboration among ministries and states. Also, there is no central agency responsible for policy advocacy or recommending changes to Acts and Rules to improve planning and project implementation. Sources added that there is no mechanism for mid-course correction in case of project failures.As per proposal, GatiShakti division, project monitoring and logistics division of DPIIT may be placed in Cabinet Secretariat. Proposal to seek cabinet nod for the organisation may be completed within 90 days.* Oct 2013: PM GatiShakti National Master Plan covering seven sector — road, rail, ports, waterways, airports, mass transport & logistics infrastructure — focussed on integrated planning & evaluation* Dec 2023 to Aug 2025 : Meetings conducted with various countries & institutions, including Korea Transport Institute, Infrastructure Australia, World Bank, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport & Tourism of Japan, IITs, IIMs & ADB* Studies have found the need for strong institutional mechanism for transport planning, need for transportation and sectoral plans, scientific research by government-funded institutions & close coordination of ministries and research institutions","Gatishakti transport planning and research organisation (gtpro) to be housed in cabinet secretariat.

Bihar polls: Parties' caste arithmetic vs caste survey — who is living upto Karpoori's dream?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-parties-caste-arithmetic-vs-caste-survey-who-is-living-upto-karpooris-dream/articleshow/124671495.cms,"'Jiski jitni sankhya bhari utni uski hissedari?'

Sabka sath sabka vikas?

NEW DELHI: It has been more than three decades since former Bihar chief minister and a flag bearer of backward classes, Karpoori Thakur bowed out from the stage of Bihar politics. However, his disciples, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav and JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar, still swear by Karpoori's name on the issue of social justice.When RJD and JD(U)-led Mahagathbandhan came to power in 2022, they conducted a caste survey to identify the exact population of the state’s Other backward castes (OBC) and Extremely Backward Castes (EBC), to push demands for policies such as expanded quotas. After initial opposition, BJP also came around and supported the exercise.The survey found out that the EBCs constitute the largest portion at 36 per cent, along with the other backward classes at 27 per cent, which amounts to 63 per cent of the total 13.07 crore population of the state; together, they constitute the socially hefty segment of backward classes. Meanwhile, the “upper caste” groups among Hindus account for only 10.6 per cent.After the caste survey report, political parties claimed that the exercise would ensure representation proportional to each community’s population. However, this seems unlikely in the upcoming Bihar elections, as parties appear to be prioritising their traditional voter bases and other factors over population-based representation during the screening of the candidates.Catering to its traditional vote banks of Yadavs and Muslims, Rashtriya Janata Dal distributed tickets to 28 Yadavs and 6 Muslims. It also included candidates from the upper caste and EBC communities. However, the exact number is unknown as Tejashwi is yet to make an official announcement.Riding on the vote banks of the upper castes, BJP gave 49 tickets (48.5%) to upper caste candidates. Meanwhile, 34 candidates (33.7%) from the OBC community were fielded, including 6 Yadavs, 15 Vaishyas, 7 Kushwahas, and 2 Kurmis. Ten EBC candidates (9.9%) and 12 SC candidates (11.9%) are also in the poll fray with BJP's symbol.While the seat-sharing deal with RJD and Left parties is still in limbo, Congress also announced a list of 48 candidates for the upcoming elections. Out of the 48 candidates, 17 tickets (35.4%) were given to upper castes, which include 8 to Bhumihars, 6 seats to Brahmins and 5 seats to Rajputs. Meanwhile, 10 seats (20.8%) are given to OBCs, which include 5 Yadavs, 1 Kurmi, 1 Goswami, 1 Kushwaha and 3 Vaishyas. The party has also fielded 5 candidates (10.4%) from Muslim communities, 5 (10.4%)from EBC, 9 (18.8%) from the SC community and one (2.1%) from the only reserved seat for the ST community in the stateAdditionally, the Left parties are contesting a total of 29 seats. Among these, 15 seats are allocated to OBC candidates, 1 to an EBC candidate, 8 to SC candidates, 2 to minority candidates, 2 to Bhumihars, and 1 to a Rajput. In terms of party distribution, the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) is contesting 10 seats, the Communist Party of India (CPI) 6 seats, and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) 4 seats.Meanwhile, BJP and JD(U) are contesting on 101 seats under the banner of NDA. The remaining 41 seats have been distributed among the minor allies.The screening seems lopsided in the NDA camp too, as BJP, which is contesting on 101 seats in the upcoming election, has fielded almost half of the candidates coming from the upper caste community.Riding on the vote banks of the upper castes, 49 tickets (48.5 per cent) were given to upper caste candidates. Meanwhile, 34 candidates (33.7 per cent) from the OBC community are fielded, including 6 Yadavs, 15 Vaishyas, 7 Kushwahas, and 2 Kurmis. 10 EBC (9.9 per cent), candidate and 12 SC (11.9 per cent) candidates are also in the poll fray with BJP's symbol.Meanwhile, chief minister Nitish Kumar's JD(U) has fielded the most candidates from the OBC, EBC and SC communities. Nitish, who has positioned himself as the poster boy of non-Yadav OBCs and EBCs, has fielded 37 candidates from the OBC community (36.6%), while 22 candidates from the EBC community (21.8%). Additionally, 15 candidates from the SC community (14.9%) and 1 candidate from the ST community (1.0%) are fielded in the poll fray. JD(U) has also distributed tickets to 22 (21.8%) candidates from the upper caste community in the upcoming assembly elections.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar assembly elections. The 243 assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the counting of votes scheduled to take place on November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, while there were 7.89 crore electors as of June 24 this year. An Election Commission press release stated that 65 lakh voters were removed from the draft list, and the number of electors in the draft list as of August 1, 2025, stood at 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly election, the BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share. The Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with a 15.7% vote share. The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) contested seven seats, winning four, and achieved 0.9% of the vote share.","Rjd and jd(u) conducted a caste survey to identify the exact population of the state’s other backward castes (obc) and extremely backward castes (ebc) the survey found out that the ebcs constitute the largest portion at 36 per cent, along with the other backward classes at 27 per cent.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124671526,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1537635,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
"EPFO final settlement period extended: PF withdrawal now after 12 months, pension after 36 months; what it means for members",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/epfo-final-settlement-period-extended-pf-withdrawal-now-after-12-months-pension-after-36-months-what-it-means-for-members/articleshow/124554802.cms,"



EPFO subscribers take note! The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members. Under the revised rules, members can now withdraw their provident fund after 12 months of unemployment and their pension after 36 months, PTI reported.The change was approved by the apex decision-making body of the EPFO, the Central Board of Trustees, chaired by Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, during a meeting held on Monday. Earlier, the scheme allowed full withdrawals from both accounts after just two months of continuous unemployment.A senior official explained PTI that the move aims to ensure social security for formal sector workers who typically exit the EPFO after two months of unemployment. “Most of these unemployed youth need to enrol again when they secure new jobs and lose chances of earning pension and other benefits, as an account becomes pensionable only after a combined service of 10 years or more,” the official said.The ministry said the revision will also allow partial withdrawals, enabling members to meet immediate financial needs without affecting their retirement savings or pension entitlements.Additionally, a provision has been introduced to maintain a minimum balance of 25 per cent of contributions in members’ accounts at all times.“This will enable members to enjoy the high interest rate currently offered by the EPFO, 8.25 per cent per annum, along with compounding benefits to build a sizeable retirement corpus,” the statement added.The rationalisation is intended to improve ease of access while ensuring members maintain a sufficient retirement fund over the long term.","Epfo has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members.

NEW DELHI: Congress MLA K N Rajanna on Saturday raised questions over whether the Karnataka government would require Muslims to seek permission for performing 'namaz' (prayers) on roads, amid a new directive banning RSS activities in public places and government institutions without prior permission.Reacting to the order, Rajanna said he would watch how far it can actually be implemented. “We have to see to what extent it can be implemented,” he said.The former minister, who was sacked a few months ago, emphasised that only rules which can be enforced should be made, otherwise they will remain only in the books.Noting that the government order was based on a letter from minister Priyank Kharge, Rajanna said the minister had only stated that the RSS could hold events in public places after obtaining permission and had never suggested a total ban.“Now, we have Idgah. They (Muslims) offer Namaz on the road only. Do they take permission? Or will they listen if they are told to get permission first?” Rajanna asked, as quoted by PTI, highlighting what he sees as a potential double standard in enforcement.The Karnataka cabinet on Thursday decided to frame new rules to regulate Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) activities, including marches and events held on government-owned properties and public roads.",Karnataka cabinet on thursday decided to frame new rules to regulate rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss) activities.

Jan Suraaj Party's Prashant Kishor Drops Bombshell, Reveals Why He Will Not Contest Bihar Elections

parivaar's

Mahagathbandhan

NEW DELHI: Jan Suraaj chief Prashant Kishor on Wednesday announced that he would stay out of the electoral fray in Bihar , even as he seeks to ""disrupt"" the state's power equation that has long swung between Nitish Kumar 's JD(U) and Lalu Prasad Yadav 's RJD .Prashant Kishor, who has served both the NDA and the Bihar(grand alliance) as a political strategist, has set for himself an ambitious target. To replace Nitish and Lalu in Bihar's caste-driven political landscape.But will his decision to stay out of the electoral ring give him an edge, or prove to be a strategic misstep?Rumours were rife that Kishor might throw a direct challenge to RJD’s successor Tejashwi Yadav from Raghopur, the Lalutraditional bastion. The speculation was not for no reason, as PK had on several instances hinted at contesting from the bastion of either Nitish or Tejashwi.But the buzz fizzled quickly, as PK on Tuesday fielded Chanchal Singh to take on Tejashwi instead.Kishor said that the party members asked him to concentrate on ensuring the victory of other party candidates, which is why he has decided not to contest the elections.The moment Kishor announced he would stay out of the contest, rivals pounced. Both the BJP and RJD took jibes at him for ""accepting defeat before the battle.""“Kishor realised that he would not win elections, and that is why he announced that he would not contest polls. Whatever he had invested in forming the Jan Suraaj Party had been recovered. His party is nothing but a ‘vote katwa’ (a party that cuts the votes of others). Jan Suraaj is the 'B' team of the RJD,"" Union minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh alleged.RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwary said: ""Kishor has realised that he and his party will face a humiliating defeat in the upcoming assembly polls. That is why he has announced that he will not contest. He has accepted defeat for the Jan Suraaj Party even before going to the battlefield.""Away from political jibes and rhetoric, is his decision truly about strengthening the Jan Suraaj in the polls, as PK claims, or is there more to it?Calling the move prudent, political analyst Kumar Vijay told TOI that if PK focuses on a single constituency, he cannot give time to party candidates.""He has taken the right decision because even CM Nitish Kumar is an MLC. Whoever leads a party needs more time. If he focuses on one constituency, he cannot give enough time to his party’s candidates. He is contesting elections across Bihar for the first time, and being the sole star of his party, I believe he thought it was prudent to devote his time to his candidates,"" Vijay said.Since Prashant Kishore is the lone big face of his party, his decision not to contest the polls has raised questions about whether it could dent the morale of his candidates.""In the present scenario, the way NDA andare fighting elections, they have created chaos in Bihar, especially in the ticket distribution system. This has given a certain edge to PK and Jan Suraaj because confusion has been created by these parties,"" Kumar Vijay told TOI.He also said that PK may not emerge as a giant slayer in the present scenario, but the ""ticket distribution system has brightened their (Jan Suraaj) chance to increase the tally"".In Bihar’s crowded political ring, Prashant Kishor has set an ambitious target of winning over 150 out of 243 seats for Jan Suraaj, calling anything less a defeat. For now, the claim looks like threading a needle in a storm.As Bihar’s campaign battle intensifies, his gamble will be tested against the state’s hard political math, where personality, perception, and caste arithmetic collide. Whether this outsider’s playbook rewrites Bihar’s politics or fades as another ambitious experiment will be the story to watch.","Prashant kishor has served both the nda and the bihar(grand alliance) as a political strategist. He has set for himself an ambitious target. To replace nitish and lalu in bihar's caste-driven political landscape. The bjp and rjd took jibes at him for ""accepting defeat before the battle"" for now, the claim looks like threading a needle in a storm.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124665882,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-68240,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

A shifting bloc



2020: Return of vote splits



Same forces, new dynamics



In the 1990s, the powerful ""MY"" (Muslim-Yadav) vote bank propelled Lalu Prasad Yadav to the summit of Bihar politics. Today, as his eldest son Tejashwi Yadav aims to repeat that feat, the crucial question is: which way will Muslim voters swing? With Prashant Kishor 's pledge to field 40 Muslim candidates and Asaduddin Owaisi ’s Grand Democratic Alliance, the answer might be more complex than ever.Filing of nominations for the first phase of polling closed on Friday, with over 1,250 candidates entering the fray for 121 seats to be contested on November 6. The remaining seats will go to the polls on November 11. The NDA, led by chief minister Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) and the BJP, appears united and confident, while the opposition Mahagathbandhan, comprising the RJD, Congress and Left parties, is struggling with internal rifts and overlapping candidacies.JD(U) has released its complete list of 101 candidates, giving prominence to backward and extremely backward classes, but only four tickets to Muslim candidates. This limited representation has raised questions about whether Nitish Kumar’s party has moved away from its earlier efforts to engage minority voters, given its long-standing alliance with the BJP. In contrast, Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj has pledged to field 40 Muslim candidates, while AIMIM, led by Asaduddin Owaisi, has joined hands with smaller outfits under the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), announcing plans to contest 64 constituencies.The Election Commission’s 2022 caste survey revealed that Muslims make up 17.7% of Bihar’s population, about 23 million people, and hold significant influence in nearly 70 of the state’s 243 constituencies, particularly in Seemanchal districts such as Kishanganj (68%), Katihar (43%), Araria (42%) and Purnia (38%). With multiple parties now targeting the same voter base, the split in the Muslim vote could once again shape the outcome.Muslim voters have historically been pivotal in Bihar’s electoral politics, often voting as a bloc in support of secular coalitions. The 2010, 2015 and 2020 elections reveal how shifts in alliances and vote splits have impacted their representation.In 2010, the RJD fielded the highest number of Muslim candidates at 30, but only six won. Congress performed even worse, with only three of its 49 Muslim candidates winning all from Muslim-majority constituencies like Kishanganj, Kasba and Bahadurganj. The JD(U)-BJP alliance, then riding high on Nitish Kumar’s first term as chief minister, won a large share of seats, including in areas with substantial Muslim populations, mainly due to the consolidation of non-Muslim votes.Five years later, in 2015, the political landscape shifted dramatically. The RJD, JD(U) and Congress came together under the Mahagathbandhan banner, drawing nearly 80% of Muslim votes. This alliance resulted in the election of 24 Muslim MLAs, up from 19 in 2010. The RJD had 12, Congress six, JD(U) five, and the CPI-ML one. Four MLAs came from Muslim-dominated Kishanganj, three each from East Champaran and Purnia, and two each from Araria, Darbhanga and Katihar.Notably, the AIMIM failed to make a mark despite contesting six seats in Seemanchal. The BJP, which had fielded only two Muslim candidates, saw both lose. As RJD’s Abdul Bari Siddiqui pointed out at the time, the increase in Muslim representation was welcome but still fell short of reflecting their 16% population share.The 2015 results reaffirmed the strength of the “MY” (Muslim-Yadav) coalition, long seen as the backbone of RJD’s social base, and marked a period of renewed confidence among minority voters in mainstream alliances.The 2020 assembly election once again saw fragmentation in Muslim voting patterns. The Grand Alliance, now led by Tejashwi Yadav, weakened as Owaisi’s AIMIM gained ground in Seemanchal, winning five seats. Although four of those MLAs later defected to the RJD, AIMIM’s performance underscored its growing appeal among young Muslim voters disillusioned with both the RJD and Congress.The RJD fielded 18 Muslim candidates, out of which eight won, while the Congress had 11 Muslim candidates and managed only four victories. The JD(U), despite being part of the NDA, failed to elect any Muslim MLA. In total, 19 Muslim legislators made it to the assembly, five fewer than in 2015.The 2020 election marked the end of a decade-long trend of consolidation and a return to fragmentation. While the Grand Alliance retained support in several mixed constituencies, AIMIM’s entry in Seemanchal altered traditional vote patterns, cutting into the secular coalition’s base and indirectly benefiting the NDA.As the 2025 election nears, political alignments are shifting. The RJD-Congress alliance remains the largest opposition bloc but is struggling with clear disagreements over seat-sharing. At the same time, AIMIM has formed the Grand Democratic Alliance with Chandrashekhar Azad’s Azad Samaj Party and Swami Prasad Maurya’s AJP, introducing fresh competition for the Muslim vote.Meanwhile, JD(U) and BJP’s joint strategy seems aimed at consolidating the majority vote while conceding limited ground to minorities. With Muslims influencing nearly one-third of Bihar’s constituencies, how this community votes, united or divided, will once again determine not just the number of seats won, but who governs the state.","Muslim voters have historically been pivotal in bihar’s electoral politics.

Optics vs reality

""Not a sign of disintegration""

A bigger bloc, more arithmetic

Friendly fights and withdrawal loophole

Not the first messy start

NDA's campaign mode on

NEW DELHI: As nominations for Phase 1 of the Bihar assembly elections closed on Friday, the NDA appeared battle-ready, its candidate list finalised, campaign plan rolled out.Across the aisle, the opposition's Mahagathbandhan (or INDIA bloc), led by Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), continues to debate who fights where. Congress and RJD, which are still holding talks, have also declared a few of its candidates for the high-prestige contest.This, obviously, has given a big ammunition to the NDA which has claimed that the Mahagathbandhan has crumbled even before the contest.Yet, despite the optics of confusion, alliance leaders insist the delay signals expansion, not disarray.Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar, who has been part of the opposition bloc's discussions, said such coordination takes time. ""Coordination matters more than speed,"" he quipped, adding that the bloc’s final list would be announced soon.Congress leader Pawan Khera on Thursday also questioned why NDA was concerned about Mahagathbandhan's deal.Khera informed that candidates were filing their nominations and the procedure for seat distribution was under way. He affirmed clearance on the situation and mentioned that the Mahagathbandhan government will be formed in Bihar.""The work is going on very well, symbols are being distributed. Those who have to file nominations are also doing so. The process has started... Very soon, the entire situation will be clear to everyone. The Mahagathbandhan government is going to be formed. Why is the NDA raising questions? They should think about themselves,"" Khera told ANI.CPI(ML) Liberation general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya dismissed speculation of infighting within the opposition alliance.""People may feel there is chaos in the INDIA bloc. But the delay in announcing seats is because more constituents are on board this time. It’s definitely not a sign of disintegration,” he told PTI.Bhattacharya revealed that his party, which won 12 of the 19 seats it contested in 2020, would field roughly the same number this time.This year's Mahagathbandhan is more crowded than in 2020, when it included the RJD, Congress, and the three Left parties — CPI(ML), CPI, and CPI(M).Now, Mukesh Sahni’s Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) has joined the fold, while talks are under way with Hemant Soren’s JMM, which wants to contest a few border seats.Congress, meanwhile, has released its first list of 48 candidates even before the seat-sharing formula was finalised - a move that signalled both impatience and self-confidence. Among the key names are state chief Rajesh Ram (Kutumba), CLP leader Shakeel Ahmad Khan (Kadwa), and Youth Congress chief Prakash Garib Das (Bachhwara).In Bachhwara, however, CPI’s Awadesh Roy has also filed papers, creating what insiders call a ""friendly contest"", a common phenomenon in Bihar’s multi-party coalitions.Sources within the bloc told PTI said RJD has tentatively agreed to allot 61 seats to the Congress, with some negotiations still underway over high-stakes constituencies.In India’s electoral playbook, such overlaps between allies are common. When alliances negotiate till the last minute, parties often field 'friendly' candidates in the same seats, using the withdrawal window to clean up overlaps once the deal is sealed.The withdrawal window, which opens after nominations close, gives them room to tidy up overlaps once the final deal is sealed. Candidates in overlapping seats typically withdraw nominations at the last minute, leaving only the officially endorsed name in the fray.With the Phase 1 withdrawal deadline on Monday, and Phase 2 deadline on Thursday, several overlapping candidates are likely to quietly withdraw once the bloc finalises its list.This isn’t the first time Bihar’s opposition has walked into an election season with unresolved seat-sharing issues.In 2020, the RJD and Congress sparred till the eleventh hour over key constituencies, and yet, the alliance went on to deliver one of its strongest performances in years, falling just short of defeating the NDA. The Grand Alliance registered win on 110 seats out of 243. Tejashwi Yadav's RJD emerged as the single largest party in the assembly and he was election leader of opposition in the assembly.The Left parties contested as part of the alliance and performed notably well, especially CPI-ML(L) that won 12 seats. Congress secured 19 seats.That precedent might have made leaders more relaxed about the optics of delay.The NDA, by contrast, has its machinery in motion. The JD(U) and BJP are contesting 101 seats each, with allies LJP (Ram Vilas), RLM, and HAM covering the rest.The BJP’s 40-member star campaigner list, led by PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, signals a high-energy campaign. Chief minister Nitish Kumar, seeking his 10th term, is pitching continuity and stability, while the opposition bets on discontent, voter fatigue and anti-incumbency.The first phase of voting will be held on November 6, the second on November 11, and counting on November 14. For now, the NDA may have the early advantage in optics, but Mahagathbandhan's late start may not necessarily have an impact on the final results.","Bjp fields samrat choudhary, vijay sinha in first list for bihar polls.

The seat-sharing surprise

The bargaining power

The kingmaker potential

Beyond caste politics - the youth factor

NEW DELHI: When Ram Vilas Paswan, Bihar's legendary political ""weatherman,"" passed away in 2020, the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) seemed at a crossroads. His son, Chirag Paswan, stepped in to lead the party, inheriting both the mantle and the expectations of a Dalit political legacy.Since taking over, Chirag has sought to modernise the party’s image, balance traditional constituency support, and stake a claim in the larger NDA alliance. His induction into the Union cabinet added national credibility and signalled his clout within the NDA. Now, he faces another test, the 2025 Bihar assembly elections — a test of both his leadership and political strategy.However, even before November 14, when votes are counted, Chirag has already emerged as a winner in terms of influence and positioning within the NDA alliance.Chirag’s negotiation skills were on full display during NDA seat-sharing talks. Engaging in multiple rounds of discussions with senior BJP and JD(U) leaders, Chirag held firm on his demands until favourable terms were agreed upon.As a result, LJP(RV) secured 29 seats, making it the largest junior ally in the NDA. As BJP and JD(U) settled for 101 seats each, other smaller allies, Jitan Ram Manjhi's HAM and Upendra Kushwaha's RLM, were allotted only six seats each.This elevated seat share signals Chirag's rising clout in Bihar politics and marks him as a key player in post-election arithmetic, irrespective of the NDA’s overall performance.Chirag Paswan's electoral performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls strengthened his bargaining position. LJP(RV) contested five seats in Bihar and won all five, registering a 100% success rate. The party also secured a nearly 6% statewide vote share, demonstrating that Chirag can mobilise voters beyond the party’s traditional Paswan-Dalit base.In previous assembly elections, LJP(RV) had a mixed record, but the Lok Sabha sweep has cemented Chirag’s reputation as a vote-getter. This electoral credit seems to have not only boosted his confidence during alliance talks but also forced larger NDA partners to accommodate his demands on both the number and strategic importance of constituencies.The BJP is probably looking at Chirag not merely as a junior partner but also as a strategic asset. With chief minister Nitish Kumar seeking a 10th term, the 29 LJP(RV) seats could prove pivotal in government formation.Chirag's willingness to challenge, renegotiate, or even realign his party at short notice adds another layer of influence. Political insiders suggest that the LJP(RV) leader could emerge as a kingmaker, shaping both cabinet formation and NDA’s legislative strategy post-elections.Chirag is working to transform the party’s image, positioning LJP(RV) as a pan-Bihar force rather than a purely caste-based outfit. His ""Bihar First, Bihari First"" campaign is emphasising on development, youth employment and governance reform.The strategy resonated with first-time voters and women, especially in urban and semi-urban pockets, who have traditionally been ambivalent about caste-based politics. If this outreach succeeds, Chirag could translate his traditional base into a broader mandate, enhancing his bargaining power in future coalition politics.With more seats than any other smaller ally, a proven track record in the Lok Sabha, negotiation leverage, kingmaker potential, and a growing voter base beyond his traditional Paswan constituency, Chirag Paswan enters the 2025 Bihar assembly elections as the biggest NDA gainer.","Chirag paswan has sought to modernise the party’s image, balance traditional constituency support, and stake a claim in the larger nda alliance.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party and Janata Dal (United)-led National Democratic Alliance have a 40 per cent chance of retaining power in the upcoming Bihar election, an opinion poll by C Voter predicted on Friday.According to the poll, Rashtriya Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan came a close second with 38.3 per cent chance of forming the government. Meanwhile, the new entrant in Bihar politics, Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj, came third in the preference list with 13.3 per cent.The scenario, however, changes when it comes to the preferred choice for chief minister. RJD scion Tejashwi Yadav emerged as the most popular face, securing 36.5% support in the opinion polls.He was followed by Prashant Kishor with 23.2%, incumbent chief minister Nitish Kumar with 15.9%, and Chirag Paswan with 8.8%.When asked who can solve Bihar’s problems, 36.5% of respondents chose the Mahagathbandhan, 12.8% opted for Jan Suraaj, 34.3% preferred the NDA, while 9.4% felt that no one could.Earlier, Tejashwi promised a government job for every household in Bihar and pledged to introduce the legislation within just 20 days of taking office.""NDA government could not provide jobs to the youth in 20 years, but we will bring the Act within 20 days of coming to power and also ensure its implementation within 20 months,"" Tejashwi told reporters at his residence.This comes as parties have geared up for what the Election Commission has called the ""mother of elections.""Seat-sharing talks are in the final stages on all sides. However, constituents of the NDA and the INDIA bloc are grappling with differences over seat-sharing, with smaller allies in both camps jostling for more seats.Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj party declared a list of 51 candidates on Thursday.Amid growing unease in the ruling NDA over the seat sharing, senior BJP leader and Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan reached Patna on Friday and will hold meetings with senior party leaders.According to news agency PTI, sources in the BJP said that the seat-sharing arrangements within the NDA will be finalized in a day or two, and the party will release its first list of candidates soon after that.The JD(U), another alliance partner of the NDA, is also expected to announce its list of candidates very soon, party sources said.According to sources in the NDA, the allies — JD(U) and BJP — are likely to contest 102 and 101 seats, respectively.Union minister Chirag Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), which had earlier settled for around 20–22 seats, is now asking for 45 segments, they said.In the opposition bloc, sources said the RJD is likely to contest 135–140 seats.The party has offered the Congress 50–52 seats, lower than the party’s demand for 70 assembly segments.Sources in the RJD said a meeting of senior party leaders will take place in Patna later in the day to finalize the list of its candidates.In the 2020 assembly polls, the Congress had fought 70 seats but won only 19.The other big constituent of the INDIA bloc, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation, also appeared unhappy with the reportedly 20–25 seats being offered to it.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar Assembly elections. The 243 Assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the counting of votes scheduled to take place on November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, while there were 7.89 crore electors as of June 24 this year. An Election Commission press release stated that 65 lakh voters were removed from the draft list, and the number of electors in the draft list as of August 1, 2025, stood at 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly election, BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share with a strike rate of 43.2%. The Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with a 15.7% vote share and a 33.5% strike rate.

Bihar Elections: NDA Announces Seat Sharing Deal; BJP, JDU Get 101 Seats Each; LJP(R) Bags 29 Seats

NEW DELHI: The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) on Saturday announced that it will contest the Bihar assembly elections independently.JMM said it would “review” its alliance with the Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in Jharkhand after the polls in the neighbouring state.Addressing a press conference, JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said, “The party has decided to contest the Bihar polls on its own. It will contest six assembly seats – Chakai, Dhamdaha, Katoria (ST), Manihari (ST), Jamui and Pirpainti (SC).” These seats will go to polls in the second phase on November 11.Elections to the 243-member Bihar assembly will be held in two phases on November 6 and 11, with counting of votes on November 14.Bhattacharya said the JMM had on October 11 informed INDIA bloc leaders that it would decide independently on contesting the Bihar elections if “a respectful number of seats” was not allotted to it by October 14. The party had sought 12 seats as part of the coalition.“We had urged constituents of the INDIA bloc like the Congress, Left parties and the RJD, which is one of the largest parties in Bihar, to provide the seats demanded by the JMM.In the 2019 Jharkhand election, we had given our support to Congress and RJD. The party not only gave seven seats to RJD, but also made its MLA from Chatra a minister,” he said.“Even in the 2024 Jharkhand polls, JMM gave six seats to the RJD and accommodated an MLA as minister,” Bhattacharya added, as quoted by PTI.Commenting on the political scenario in Bihar, Bhattacharya said the contest will be multi-cornered and marked by internal divisions. “The battle of Bihar is a multi-corner fight where infighting prevails in the NDA as well as the INDIA bloc,” he said.“We will fight, win and make sure that without the JMM, no government is formed in Bihar,” he asserted. “And, after the Bihar polls, the JMM will have a relook at the coalition in Jharkhand.”The party also announced a list of 20 “star campaigners” for the Bihar elections, led by its president and Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren.

In the upcoming Bihar assembly election, multiple factors will come into play including caste dynamics, anti-incumbency sentiments, internal rifts in both major coalitions, the emergence of new political players like Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj Party and significant voter-driven issues like unemployment and development.Assembly elections are scheduled to be held in Bihar this year on 6 November and 11 November to elect a total of 243 members. Here are the key factors playing a role:Long-time chief minister Nitish Kumar, at the forefront for nearly two decades, faces increasing anti-incumbency sentiment and voter fatigue with his shifting alliances also raising questions about his credibility.RJD's leader Tejashwi Yadav is gaining popularity, particularly among the youth, by focusing on issues like jobs and migration. He was named the Mahagathbandhan's chief ministerial candidate, though some question his leadership experience and the party's legacy.The NDA government faces considerable anti-incumbency, but this is among the opposition, potentially neutralizing its effect. Both alliances are relying on welfare schemes to sway voters.The election features a close contest between the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the opposition INDIA bloc (Mahagathbandhan).Both major coalitions are dealing with internal conflicts over seat-sharing.The NDA has seen tensions between the BJP and JD(U), partly due to past actions involving Chirag Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), who was allegedly used as a 'vote-cutter' against chief minister Nitish Kumar in 2020 but is now a key NDA ally.Meanwhile, the Mahagathbandhan is seeing infighting, with candidates from its member parties, such as the RJD and Congress, contesting against each other in some constituencies.Traditionally, the NDA has relied on support from upper castes, non-Yadav OBCs, and Mahadalits, while the Mahagathbandhan has depended on a Muslim-Yadav (MY) vote bank.However, voting patterns are becoming more fluid. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the Mahagathbandhan made inroads into the Scheduled Caste (SC) vote by focusing on social justice issues and reservations.The Dalit vote, which makes up 20% of the electorate, is complex and fragmented among different sub-castes. While some sub-castes align with the NDA through leaders like Chirag Paswan and Jitan Ram Manjhi, others are shifting toward the Mahagathbandhan.Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj Party (JSP) has emerged as a potential disruptor by appealing to youth and educated voters on a platform of development and non-traditional caste politics.Once among India’s most sought-after election strategists, Prashant however announced that he would stay away from contesting this year’s Bihar polls — a decision he said was taken 'in the larger interest' of his Jan Suraaj Party.His sharp criticism targets both NDA and Mahagathbandhan leaders, challenging their credibility and governance. He has described this election as a make-or-break moment for his party, stating it will either finish first or last, leaving no middle ground.Meanwhile, the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) has announced the launch of a new third front — the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA). The alliance brings together AIMIM, Chandrasekhar Azad’s Azad Samaj Party (ASP) and Swami Prasad Maurya’s Apna Janata Party (AJP). It plans to field candidates in at least 64 of the 243 constituencies.A recent statewide caste census found that Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) constitute over 63% of the population. This has intensified the focus on caste-based mobilization.Bihar's total population of approximately 13.07 crore is divided along caste lines as follows: Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) constitute about 36.01%, Other Backward Classes (OBCs) 27.12%, Scheduled Castes (SCs) 19.65%, Scheduled Tribes (STs) 1.68%, and General Category about 15.38%.BJP leans on upper-caste blocs, Brahmins, Rajputs, Bhumihars and Kayasthas, who, while a minority, wield outsized influence. However, the party, which is aiming to be self-sufficient in Bihar without relying heavily on the JDU alliance, has broadened its outreach to non-Yadav OBCs and EBCs by elevating leaders from those groups and secured roughly 30% of votes in recent contests through this social mix.The Mahagathbandhan (Grand Alliance) in Bihar faces a complex caste and electoral landscape shaped by the state's diverse demographic composition. Together, this Muslim-Yadav combination makes up more than 30% of the electorate supporting RJD. The Indian National Congress garners support mainly from upper castes, some OBC sub-groups, and urban voters, forming a moderate but significant segment of the Mahagathbandhan.A major concern for voters is high unemployment and the ongoing out-migration of youth seeking better job prospects elsewhere.Both alliances have made ambitious economic promises that critics say the state budget can barely afford, raising questions about their feasibility.Women are emerging as a distinct voting bloc, with the NDA seeing stronger support among women voters partly due to welfare schemes.Bihar's significant Muslim population remains a decisive force, with the Mahagathbandhan largely backed by Muslim voters. However, AIMIM and JSP could potentially divide this vote.",Bihar will vote in two phases - 6 and 11 november. The election features a close contest between the ruling national democratic alliance (nda) and the opposition india bloc (mahagathbandhan) both major coalitions are dealing with internal conflicts over seat-sharing.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124664342,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1464562,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

'Amit Shah Behaving Like Acting PM': Mamata Banerjee's 'Mir Jafar' Warning To PM Modi

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday said that while infiltration has stopped in BJP-ruled Assam , it continues in neighbouring West Bengal, claiming that the state government is giving a ""red carpet welcome"" to illegal immigrants.Addressing a media conclave in Patna, Shah also mocked Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for dropping the allegation of ""vote theft,"" and said the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls would remove ""infiltrators.""""It is baffling that the opposition has been getting a bellyache over an exercise launched by the Election Commission, which would weed out infiltrators. I am fully in support of the SIR exercise, which would eventually take place in the entire country,"" he said at the conclave, as reported by news agency PTI.When reminded that the opposition blamed the Centre for infiltration in the country, which has been in power at the Centre for 11 years, Shah said, ""People sitting in Lutyens Delhi have no idea of what the borders are like. The border with Bangladesh has dense forests and mighty rivers, which are in spate during the monsoons. Fencing is impossible, and so is round-the-clock vigil. Boats for security personnel manning the borders also tend to get washed away.""My point is, when a person from the neighbouring country enters our territory, can it not be known to the local police station and the patwari? Why do these officials not raise an alarm? Because they are under orders from above to give a red carpet ('lal jaajim') welcome to these infiltrators. This is the reason why infiltration is rampant in West Bengal but has been checked in Assam,"" he added.Shah urged people in West Bengal to vote out chief minister Mamata Banerjee in next year’s assembly elections and promised to ""drive out every infiltrator"" from the state.Claiming that Gandhi has dropped the ""vote chori"" charge, Shah said, ""on the very few occasions that he has been seen in public, he has never made the charge in the last 15 days. Perhaps the people of Bihar have made him give up on the charge. He must have been under advice based on some feedback.""The reference was to Gandhi’s 'Voter Adhikar Yatra' in Bihar, which protested the SIR exercise, alleging it aimed to disenfranchise voters.Shah also rejected opposition claims that the 130th Constitutional Amendment Bill, which allows removal of ministers including the PM and CMs if jailed for 30 days or more, was meant to destabilise governments in non-BJP states.""I had stepped down when a case was pending against me in the court, and did not accept a post until I was acquitted. We have seen, in the recent past, governments being run by people behind bars. That cannot be allowed. Why is the opposition so scared? The Bill does not stipulate that a minister be removed as soon as his name comes up in an FIR,"" he said.","Union home minister amit shah says west bengal is giving a ""red carpet welcome"" to illegal immigrants.

10 seats or more than 150? PK’s all-or-nothing gamble



'Mungerilal ke haseen sapne?'



Can Jan Suraaj really disrupt the two-horse race?



NEW DELHI: For nearly three decades, Bihar has been dominated by socialist forces, with Lalu Prasad ’s RJD and Nitish Kumar ’s JD(U) shaping the state’s political landscape. Since 1990, these two stalwarts of the JP movement have kept national parties on the sidelines. Ahead of the 2025 elections, however, a new narrative is emerging. Prashant Kishor ’s Jan Suraaj is attempting, perhaps for the first time, to challenge the decades-old socialist discourse and offer an alternative vision for Bihar.Kishor-led Jan Suraaj has opened the doors to a third-front contest, challenging both Nitish Kumar-led NDA and the Mahagathbandhan, now fronted by Lalu’s son, Tejashwi Yadav . Notably, Jan Suraaj may be the only Bihar-based party contesting all 243 seats.Could this be the start of a new political mood in Bihar? The party is staking its claim on issues like employment, education, and migration, moving away from the traditional caste-centered politics that have dominated the state for decades. Jan Suraaj can be now viewed as a party of parallel politics or alternative politics, offering voters a local option beyond the familiar two fronts.On being asked byabout Jan Suraaj chief Kishor’s efforts and whether he could challenge Bihar’s two-horse race, political analystsaid: ""Prashant Kishor has emerged as a significant factor in Bihar elections.Wherever he fields Muslim-Yadav candidates, he will dent the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan, and wherever he fields upper-caste candidates, he will impact the NDA. He will certainly be a strong factor for both factions.""On whether his issues will translate into votes, Vijay added: ""The issues he is raising are reaching the masses, but how they convert into votes remains to be seen on the D-Day.""Addressing Kishor’s decision not to contest the polls, Vijay drew a parallel with current CM Nitish Kumar, who also doesn’t contest assembly elections and remains an MLC: ""His exit won’t really affect Jan Suraaj’s experiment or harm its prospects. It doesn’t carry much weight. People in Bihar are politically aware; they will decide quietly, and it’s difficult to gauge public mood on the roads.""This time, Kishor is himself in the fray as the leader of the party he launched last year, Jan Suraaj, aiming for an upset akin to AAP’s shock victory in Delhi in 2015.That may sound far-fetched, yet PK can hardly be faulted for lack of effort. He has travelled across Bihar, drawing on his years of campaign experience for others, and launched an ambitious drive that takes direct aim at the entrenched political class.Fed up with Congress rule in the early 1990s, Bihar turned to Lalu Prasad and RJD, reshaping politics under the influence of Mandal-era dynamics. Lalu-Rabri’s tenure of over a decade entrenched the family-first ethos, but was often criticised for corruption and poor law-and-order, earning the nickname “jungleraaj.”Then came Nitish Kumar, who emerged as Bihar’s longest-serving CM. Yet, despite reforms and initiatives, the state remained one of India’s most backward, struggling with GDP per capita, poverty, and development indicators, creating fertile ground for voters seeking alternatives.A recent C-Voter survey revealed that Prashant Kishor is the second most preferred leader for the chief ministerial post, behind Tejashwi Yadav and ahead of Nitish Kumar, signalling significant public confidence in his leadership potential.Prashant Kishor confirmed he will not contest the upcoming assembly elections, saying this was for the “greater good” of his party. Speaking to PTI, he said,“If I were to contest, it would distract me from necessary organisational work.”He added that Chanchal Singh will contest against Tejashwi Yadav in Raghopur instead.Kishor’s own prediction is audacious: “I can say with certainty that we will either win handsomely or receive a drubbing. I have been stating on record that I expect a tally of either fewer than 10 seats or more than 150 seats. There is no possibility of anything in between.”Despite stepping aside, he exudes confidence: “We will either win handsomely or face a complete drubbing. There’s no middle ground. A tally below 150 will be a defeat for me.”The reactions from rival parties have been scathing. RJD claimed Kishor has “accepted defeat for his Jan Suraaj Party even before going to the battlefield,” while BJP said, “Kishor realised he would not win elections.” JD(U) called it a “humiliation for his party workers.”RJD’s Mrityunjay Tiwary said, “Kishor’s tyre has been flattened,” BJP’s Niraj Kumar added, “his bubble burst even before the elections,” and JD(U)’s Neeraj Kumar said, “He has run away before the electoral battle.” Union minister Giriraj Singh mocked the venture as “Mungerilal ke haseen sapne,” calling Jan Suraaj a “vote katwa” and “RJD’s B team.”Observers note that PK’s Brahmin background and leadership style could appeal to upper-caste youth who feel excluded in Bihar politics. Yet the state’s political structure remains largely bipolar, meaning Jan Suraaj risks being seen as a spoiler rather than a serious contender.A top poll strategist-turned-politician has surprisingly opted out of contesting his party’s first election, raising questions about his approach.While NDA has mostly finalised seat-sharing, the Mahagathbandhan’s candidate announcements remain a bit indecisive on some seats over seat-sharing discussions.Bihar now faces not just an RJD vs JD(U)/NDA battle, but a potential challenge from Jan Suraaj, testing voter appetite for a new political alternative.","Prashant kishor's jan suraaj is attempting, perhaps for the first time, to challenge the decades-old socialist discourse.
