"SC to courts: Show courage, drop cases before trial if proof not strong",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-to-courts-show-courage-drop-cases-before-trial-if-proof-not-strong/articleshow/128285342.cms,"NEW DELHI: Criminal proceedings bring strain and social stigma, the SC said on Thursday, urging courts, particularly trial courts, to show “clarity and courage” to discharge an accused at the framing of charges itself when the material on record fails to make out a prima facie case.A bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and N K Singh said that judicial process itself should not become a punishment, and the courts must remain alive to the human consequences of their decisions and to the trust society places in them. The court passed the order while discharging a person under SC/ST Act after it found that ingredients of the offence under the special law was not met but it allowed trial court to proceed for offences under IPC.The top court said charges are to be framed only if the court forms an opinion that there is a ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence and said HCs should also apply their mind on discharge plea and not to reject it mechanically.“...at the stage of framing of charge or considering discharge, the court is not dealing with an abstract legal exercise. It is dealing with real people, real anxieties and the real weight of criminal prosecution.Judicial responsibility at this stage calls for care, balance, and an honest engagement with the facts on record. The power to frame a charge is not meant to be exercised by default or out of caution alone. When the material placed before the court, taken at face value, does not disclose the ingredients of an offence, the law expects the court to have the clarity and courage to say so and to keep such a case aside,” Justice Karol, who wrote the judgment for the bench, said. The bench said discharge is not a technical indulgence “but an essential safeguard”.“The court must consciously distinguish between a genuine case that warrants a trial and one that rests only on suspicion or assumption or for that matter without any basis. To allow a matter to proceed despite the absence of a prima facie case is to expose a person to the strain, stigma, and uncertainty of criminal proceedings without legal necessity. Fidelity to the rule of law requires the court to remember that the process itself can become the punishment if this responsibility is not exercised with care,” it said.The bench said the responsibility weighs the heaviest on trial courts.“For a litigant or an accused, the trial court is not just one level in a hierarchy. It represents the face of the judiciary itself. The sensitivity, fairness, and legal discipline shown at this stage shape how ordinary citizens understand justice. The impression a trial court creates, through its approach to facts and law, often becomes the impression people carry of the entire judicial system. That is why, at every stage and especially at the threshold, trial courts must remain alive to the human consequences of their decisions and to the trust that society places in them,” it said.",The top court said charges are to be framed only if the court forms an opinion that there is a ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence.

Rera only facilitating builders in default: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rera-only-facilitating-builders-in-default-sc/articleshow/128284797.cms,"Better Abolish It: Bench At Hearing On HP Office Shift

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday said it is high time all states rethought the constitution of the real estate regulatory authority (Rera) as the institution is doing nothing except “facilitating” defaulting builders.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said the people for whom Rera was created were “completely disappointed”. “Better abolish this institution, we don’t mind that,” the CJI said. The observations came as the bench permitted the Himachal govt to shift the Rera office to a place of its choice.“...High time that all the states should revisit and rethink of even constituting this authority,” the bench said.When the bench was informed that a retired IAS officer was appointed in Rera, the CJI said, “In every state, it has become a rehabilitation centre. These authorities are all occupied by these persons.”The advocate general of Himachal told the bench that, as per a policy decision, the state is developing Palampur, Dharamshala and other cities.The CJI asked, “What is the logic of having a retired bureaucrat? How he will be able to help in developing Palampur? You need to avail services of some architect who is environment friendly, knows Palampur, Dharamshala and these areas.Only those persons will help”.The bench issued notice on a plea filed by Himachal Pradesh govt and others challenging an order of the high court in a matter pertaining to the shifting of the state Rera office from Shimla to Dharamshala. The HC had earlier stayed a June 2025 notification concerning the shifting of the Rera office till further order. Later, in its order on Dec 30, 2025, the court directed the continuance of the interim order. The top court stayed the HC’s Dec 30 direction.In its plea filed in the top court through advocate Sugandha Anand, the state said the decision to shift the office was taken to “decongest” Shimla, and it was purely on administrative considerations. An advocate, appearing for the respondent, said 90% of the projects with which the authority deals are in Shimla, Solan, Parwanoo and Sirmaur, which are within a radius of a maximum of 40km. He said about 92% of complaints pending before Rera are from these districts; only 20 projects are in Dharamshala.“The people for whom this institution was created, they are completely depressed, disgusted and disappointed. None of them are getting any effective relief. For whom this institution actually is now serving, you will find out when you meet these people,” the bench said.The top court also observed that Shimla is “completely over exhausted”. Issuing notice on the plea, the bench said, “The state is permitted to shift the office of Rera to the place of its choice. However, it shall be subject to the final outcome of the writ petition pending before the high court”.The bench was also informed that Shimla district judge hears appeals against the orders passed by Rera. To ensure those affected by the orders of Rera do not face any inconvenience visiting Shimla for filing appeals, it is directed that appellate power may be shifted to principal district judge of Dharamshala, the bench said.","Supreme court says it is high time all states rethought the constitution of the real estate regulatory authority (rera) the bench permitted the himachal govt to shift the rera office to a place of its choice.

NEW DELHI: The row over Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla’s statement that last week he was forced to request PM Narendra Modi not to speak during the debate on motion of thanks to President because of the fear that some of Congress’ women MPs had planned to do something unprecedentely indecorous, has taken another turn with parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju releasing a video.Rijiju said the video showing women MPs of Congress engaged in a verbal confrontation at Speaker Om Birla’s chamber, proves his claim that the bunch was aggressive.“This is the video clip taken by a Congress MP when 20–25 Congress MPs entered the Speaker’s chamber, abused him and threatened the PM. Our party believes in debate and discussion and never encouraged MPs to threaten physically,” he said.The nine-second video showed MPs making some angry comments, which Congress said followed BJP MP Nishikant Dubey’s attack on Nehru-Gandhi family citing some books. It was an abusive behaviour, he alleged.His comments are a counter to the opposition’s rejection of Speaker’s statement that Modi’s scheduled speech in Lok Sabha on Feb 2 was called off at the last moment due to apprehension of any incident involving opposition MPs.","Kiren rijiju slams congress, shares video of women mps at pm modi's lok sabha seat.

"Centre rejects Sixth Schedule, statehood for Ladakh, offers council",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-rejects-sixth-schedule-statehood-for-ladakh-offers-council/articleshow/128273026.cms,"JAMMU: The Centre has made it clear that Ladakh will not be granted Sixth Schedule status or statehood, two key demands of Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), the region’s two major political organisations said after talks in New Delhi last week.The Sixth Schedule of the Constitution allows special administrative arrangements for tribal areas to safeguard autonomy, culture and land. Speaking publicly for the first time after the Feb 4 talks with a Union home ministry (MHA) high-powered committee, Ladakh leaders said the Centre had instead offered a “territorial council” model.Under this proposal, chief executive councillor of Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) will be designated as CM and the deputy chief executive councillor as deputy CM.“We call it a farce. LAB and KDA rejected it (the offer), except for one KDA member, Kunzes Dolma,” KDA co-chairman Asgar Ali Karbali said at a gathering in Kargil on Wednesday.According to Karbali, Dolma had earlier supported KDA’s agenda and was nominated as a member for the talks. “She told the high-powered committee that a conspiracy was hatched to remove her and that she is satisfied with the Union Territory status for Ladakh.We will not tolerate anyone, whether Dolma or anyone else, who plays with Ladakhi identity,” Karbali said.As Karbali spoke, many in the Kargil gathering raised slogans against Dolma and chanted support for Sonam Wangchuk, LAB member and climate activist jailed over violence in Sept 2025 during statehood protests in Leh.After the talks negotiations with the MHA committee headed by junior Union home minister Home Nityanand Rai, Karbali and Ladakh Buddhist Association (LBA) president Tsering Dorje Lakrook had described the talks as inconclusive.“When we reiterated Sixth Schedule status and statehood, they (MHA officials) argued that the Sixth Schedule has become ‘defunct’ and largely powerless. We disagreed. Supreme Court has repeatedly held Sixth Schedule as a law in itself and a strong constitutional safeguard. If it is powerful in the Northeastern states, why is it suddenly being called weak for Ladakh?” Karbali said.On statehood, Karbali said the MHA’s main objection was that Ladakh lacks sufficient financial resources. “When we asked that our legal experts be allowed to explain this, we were told they could not be called into the meeting. There is no Indian state that has every resource within its own territory,” Karbali argued.He reiterated the LAB and the KDA remain united in pressing for Sixth Schedule status and statehood as their core demands.","The centre has made it clear that ladakh will not be granted sixth schedule status or statehood, the region’s two major political organisations said after talks in new delhi last week.

Friends without benefits?

NEW DELHI: The Congress–DMK alliance in Tamil Nadu faced renewed strain on Thursday after Congress MP Manickam Tagore publicly pushed back against chief minister MK Stalin after he dismissed the power-sharing demands as a ""conspiracy"".Tagore, one of the most vocal proponents of a share in governance for Congress, questioned Stalin’s remarks in one-line post on X: ""How is it that seeking, in a spirit of friendship, a role (a share) in work to serve the people could be termed as conspiracy?"" The pointed response, accompanied by a thinking-face emoji, suggested that at least a section of the party is unwilling to soften its stand even after the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leadership drew a clear red line.DMK chief Stalin on Wednesday firmly ruled out sharing power with allies, while insisting that the alliance with the Congress was ""intact"" and free of confusion. ""We also know that it will not work in Tamil Nadu; they (Congress) know it too. It is a problem created by some people. They are deliberately conspiring to see if there will be a rift in the alliance. We are not worried about it. Rahul Gandhi is not worried either,"" Stalin said.Emphasising continuity, the chief minister added, ""The DMK-Congress alliance is in harmony. What others are expecting will not happen,"" Stalin said.The DMK leadership has since doubled down on that position. Senior party leader and Tamil Nadu forests minister RS Rajakannappan struck a blunt note saying the party did not run on the strength of alliances. ""If they come, let them come; if they go, let them go. It is the chief minister’s preference,"" he said.Rajakannappan also invoked history to justify the DMK's stance. ""When Kalaignar won more than 100 seats, did he allow a share in governance? When the DMK is poised to win 150 seats, how can we give a share?"" he had asked at a recent event, reiterating that there would only be a ""Dravida model"" government under Stalin.Within the Congress, the signals are more mixed. While Tagore has argued that the question of whether Tamil Nadu should have a single-party or coalition government should be left to the people, the party’s state leadership has opted for caution. TNCC president K Selvaperunthagai said the chief minister had expressed his view and added, ""Every party has its own opinion. Our leaders voice their views. Everyone, including the AICC high command and the CM, will sit and discuss and take a good decision. "" He insisted that there was ""no opportunity"" for a crack in the alliance.Stalin's carefully worded response till now on power-sharing had asserted DMK dominance in the alliance while avoiding a direct confrontation with the Congress leadership. His recent comment has, however, put Congress leadership in a very uncomfortable spot.Political commentator Suguna Diwakar told TOI earlier that a large number of Congress functionaries were not very particular about share in power, and that party would remain with the DMK. “There is no strong demand from the Congress leadership for a share in power. None of the party top brass was adamant about their demand. Only stray voices such as AICC functionary Praveen Chakravarty and Congress MP Manickam Tagore made these demands,” he said. “At least now they are strong with 18 MLAs and if they join an untested player like Vijay they will be reduced to a minor party in the state,” said Suguna Diwakar.However, there's one more option.Politcal analyst TSS Mani said majority of Congress cadres and functionaries wish to go with the TVK. He told TOI that AICC general secretary KC Venugopal feels that TVK president Vijay has a considerable number of fans in Kerala as well as other southern states. ""Congress leaders feel that this support base will help the party in 2029,"" Mani said.The recent out-in-the-open tension between the DMK and the Congress has however given an ammunition to the Bharatiya Janata Party. The saffron party has claimed both allies were searching for an exit ahead of the 2026 assembly elections. ""DMK feels Congress is a waste luggage to carry, and Congress feels the DMK may not return due to anti-incumbency,"" BJP spokesperson Narayanan Tirupathy claimed, calling the situation a standoff with each side waiting for the other to blink.For now, both allies maintain that the partnership endures. Yet the increasingly public exchange of sharp words over power-sharing raised questions about how long the truce can hold as negotiations over seats and strategy for 2026 draw closer.","Congress mp manickam tagore publicly pushed back against chief minister mk stalin after he dismissed the power-sharing demands as a ""conspiracy"" tagore, one of the most vocal proponents of a share in governance for congress, questioned stalin’s remarks in one-line post on x.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128254142,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1040000,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
"Muslim groups, Left, TMC oppose govt’s move to mandate recitation of all 6 verses of Vande Mataram",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/muslim-groups-left-tmc-oppose-govts-move-to-mandate-recitation-of-all-6-verses-of-vande-mataram/articleshow/128276596.cms,"NEW DELHI: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board on Thursday strongly objected to the central govt’s recent notification mandating the recitation of all six verses of ‘Vande Mataram’ at official functions and in schools before the National Anthem, Jana Gana Mana.The AIMPLB has termed the decision “unconstitutional and contrary to religious freedom” and demanded that the govt immediately withdraw the notification or else it will challenge it in the court. Both factions of prominent Muslim body Jamiat Ulama -i- Hind have also raised objections to the govt’s order.Meanwhile, Left parties like CPI(M) and CPI also came forward to oppose the MHA order. CPI(M) demanded that the govt “uphold the spirit of the Constitution and immediately withdraw this order”.The CPI(M) accused the BJP-led union govt of attempting to create an “unnecessary controversy concerning the national song and the national anthem with ulterior motives” and that the “BJP govt should not be allowed to play with such historic cultural symbols.”The Left party highlighted that “the Constitution of India clearly states in Article 51A(a) that it is the duty of every citizen to respect the national flag and the national anthem.After thorough deliberation, the constituent assembly adopted the statement made by President Rajendra Prasad concerning the national song, whose two stanzas only would be sung.”“Through its recent order, the govt seeks to include the remaining four stanzas, which the constituent assembly felt did not resonate the secular character of the Indian Republic,” the party added.CPI’s Rajya Sabha MP Sandosh Kumar P accused the govt of “cynically weaponising culture to polarise the people.” “Our position is clear: for us, the country comes first; for the BJP, elections come first,” he added.Referring to the ruling party at the Centre, he alleged that “it is deeply ironic that those who had no role in the freedom struggle and remained subservient to British colonialism now claim the authority to issue certificates of nationalism.”Trinamool Congress lashed out at the govt alleging that the BJP was “Bangla-Birodhi”. “And now, in an official notification, @HMOIndia has distorted the original lyrics of Vande Mataram penned by Rishi Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay in Anandamath,” the party alleged in a post on X.Elaborating on the reasons for opposition, AIMPLB general secretary, Maulana Mohammed Fazlur Rahim Mujaddidi, alleged that the MHA order was “unconstitutional, against religious freedom and secular values, contrary to Supreme Court judgment, and directly conflicting with the religious beliefs of Muslims.”“Whatever the political considerations behind implementing this decision ahead of the West Bengal elections, Muslims cannot accept it, as it directly conflicts with their faith,” he added.Maulana Mujaddidi said that, following Rabindranath Tagore’s advice and deliberations in the Constituent Assembly, it had been agreed that only the first two stanzas of Vande Mataram would be used. He said that “a secular government cannot forcibly impose the beliefs or teachings of one religion upon followers of other religions”.He added that the song was written in the context of Bengal and contains references to the worship and veneration of Durga and other deities.“A Muslim worships only one God, Allah, without partners, and Islam does not permit any form of associating partners with God,” the AIMPLB general secretary emphasised.“Therefore, the Board demands that the Central Government immediately withdraw the notification; otherwise, the Board will challenge it in the court,” he asserted.Jamiat Ulama - i - Hind president Maulana Arshad Madani described the govt order as “biased” that he alleged was “a conspiracy to snatch the religious freedom” granted to all citizens by the Constitution of India.He further alleged that the Central govt’s order on Vande Mataram was a “unilateral and coercive decision” and that it reflects “a systematic attempt to curtail the constitutional rights of minorities”.“Muslims do not prevent anyone from singing or playing “Vande Mataram”; however, some verses of the song are based on beliefs that portray the homeland as a deity, which contradict the fundamental belief of monotheistic religions. Since a Muslim worships only one Allah, forcing him to sing this song is a clear violation of Article 25 of the Constitution and several judgments of the Supreme Court,” he added.In a statement from the Maulana Mahmood Madani-led faction of Jamiat Ulama -i- Hind faction, its general secretary Maulana Hakimuddin Qasmi said, “If the majority community wishes to recite it, they are fully entitled to do so. However, making it mandatory for all citizens would amount to imposing restrictions on religious freedom,” he added.He stated that the Constitution of India guarantees every citizen the inalienable right to profess, practice, and propagate his or her religion, and to live in accordance with one’s faith and conscience. “Therefore, compelling any individual to recite a specific poem or composition that conflicts with his or her religious beliefs is contrary to the spirit and provisions of the Constitution,” he said.He further stated that “India is a pluralistic and multi-religious nation where constitutional supremacy and the principle of “unity in diversity” form the foundation of national integration. Any step that weakens this foundation cannot be in the interest of the country.”“The Muslims of India hold a unanimous and unequivocal position that any decision undermining religious freedom will not be accepted. We strongly urge the Government of India to review the said circular in light of constitutional provisions, judicial precedents, and the diverse social fabric of the nation, so that religious liberty, constitutional dignity, and social harmony may be preserved,” he added.",The all india muslim personal law board has termed the decision ‘unconstitutional and contrary to religious freedom’ both factions of prominent muslim body jamiat ulama -i- hind have also raised objections to the govt’s order.

Accused Shivam Mishra Gets Bail Within Hours of Arrest in Kanpur Crash Case

NEW DELHI: A local court in Kanpur criticised the police for procedural lapses as it granted bail to VVIP brat Shivam Mishra just hours after his arrest on Thursday, four days after a high-end Lamborghini, allegedly driven by Mishra, crashed into pedestrians, injuring six.“There were serious procedural lapses by the police. The arrest was carried out without proper notice under the BNSS (Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita) and violated Supreme Court guidelines set in the Arnesh Kumar case,” the additional chief judicial magistrate (ACJM) said.Arnesh Kumar vs. State of Bihar (2014), also known as the Arnesh Kumar Guidelines, is a landmark judgment of the Supreme Court, stating arrests should be an exception in cases where the punishment is less than seven years of imprisonment.Meanwhile, after his arrest, Mishra, son of tobacco baron KK Mishra, was produced before the court around 10 am, with the police seeking 14 days of judicial custody.However, the court rejected the plea and instead granted him bail on a personal bond of Rs 20,000, according to Anant Sharma, Mishra’s counsel.The crash took place around 3 pm on Sunday when a Lamborghini Revuelto, an Italian luxury sports car worth over Rs 10 crore, rammed into pedestrians and vehicles on Kanpur's VIP Road.Mohd Taufeeq, 18, an e-rickshaw driver injured in the crash, lodged a complaint. However, the counsel for the accused later claimed that Taufeeq was ""not keen"" on pursuing legal action.Police said their preliminary probe, supported by CCTV footage and eyewitness accounts, indicated that the car was speeding before the collision.Videos circulating on social media appear to show private security personnel pulling a man believed to be Mishra out of the driver’s seat immediately after the crash and taking him away in another SUV.Initially, the First Information Report (FIR) named an “unidentified driver” as the accused. It was later amended to include Shivam Mishra after what police described as preliminary evidence linking him to the vehicle.In Wednesday’s hearing, the local court rejected the surrender application of Mohan Lal, Mishra's driver, observing that his name did not appear in the FIR and that available evidence pointed to Mishra as the driver.While police have stood by their findings, Mishra’s father and his lawyer have maintained that he was not driving the Lamborghini at the time of the accident.They claimed that Lal was at the wheel and that Mishra was unwell and suffered a medical episode during the ride — a condition his family says could have contributed to the mishap.KK Mishra also alleged that the car had experienced a ""technical issue"" prior to the crash. Officials said these claims are expected to be examined as part of the ongoing investigation, including potential medical and forensic evaluations.","Vvip brat shivam mishra granted bail just hours after his arrest on thursday.

Is ‘solo’ the best way forward?

NEW DELHI: Is the Congress decision to go solo in West Bengal a bold political move with the party’s long-term gains in mind? Or is it a move fraught with political risks in a state where the grand-old party has been literally wiped out from the ground? The Congress, which faces an existential crisis in the state, has broken its alliance with the Left and announced to go solo in all 294 seats in the upcoming assembly elections.Now, consider these facts:In both these elections, the Congress had aligned with the Left to take on the common enemy - the ruling Trinamool Congress and its leader Mamata Banerjee . The Congress’s electoral strategy and political campaign centred around a very strong anti-Mamata theme, led by the then party chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who is a known staunch and vocal critic of the Trinamool chief.Interestingly, while the Congress and the Left went all guns blazing against Mamata, the relentless BJP gained ground and captured the opposition space. The story of the 2021 assembly elections in West Bengal was the rise of the BJP as main opposition party and the simultaneous decimation of the Congress and the Left in state politics.So, while the Congress tally in assembly went down from 44 in 2016 to 0 in 2021, the BJP’s score increased from 3 in 2016 to 77 in 2021. In terms of vote share, the pattern was all the more worrying. Congress went down from 12.25% to 3.03% while the BJP jumped from 10.16% to 37.97%.The Congress’s decision to contest solo may signal the party’s resolve to take the long and difficult path of revival, but it perhaps ignores the grim ground reality of the party’s diminishing presence and influence in West Bengal.Does the party have enough time to make its presence felt among the electorate? More so, when its main rivals - the Trinamool Congress and the BJP have already taken giant strides on the ground to woo the voters.Mamata Banerjee and her Trinamool have unleashed an all-out offensive against the Election Commission … from the streets of Kolkata to the Supreme Court in the national capital. Mamata has also announced many welfare-driven measures in her interim budget to set the electoral narrative ahead of the high-stakes polls.Some of the key announcements include:The BJP is also in an overdrive as it makes yet another attempt to wrest power from the Trinamool Congress. Top BJP leaders, both in Bengal and in Delhi, have been relentless in their attacks against Mamata Banerjee linking almost every incident in the state to the failure of the Trinamool government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah have already addressed many political rallies in the poll-bound state. BJP chief Nitin Nabin has been holding meetings with all stakeholders to energise the party cadres.Here’s a look at some of the key moves which the BJP has already made:In the midst of all these political buzz, the Congress, unfortunately, has been missing from action till now. The Congress leadership seems to have done little on the ground after the past electoral drubbings except effecting a leadership change in the state. Shubhankar Sarkar replaced Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury as the West Bengal Congress chief in September 2024.Since Adhir was a staunch critic of Mamata Banerjee and was the biggest hurdle in any possible alliance with the Trinamool, the change of guard was construed as a shift in the party’s approach vis-a-vis the Trinamool chief. However, once it was clear that Mamata was not interested in any tie-up, the Congress had no option but to go solo in the assembly polls. Continuing with the Left alliance was not an option given the fact that the Congress has high stakes in Kerala where the CPM-led LDF is its main rival.Shubhankar Sarkar after taking charge had stated that the 2026 assembly elections and strengthening the organisation were two of his immediate missions. However, just months away from the 2026 electoral battle, he seems to be still far away from achieving either of them.Over the years, the Congress has lost its political ground to regional parties across states. Many of the regional parties have grown in the states at the expense of the Congress. Any attempt by the grand-old party to regain its political space is resisted by these state parties leading to friction. This contradiction has been at the core of the alliance trouble which the Congress has had with the regional parties. It is in this context that the party’s decision to go solo in West Bengal should be analyzed. The Congress, which has been voiceless in the state assembly for the last 5 years, has nothing to lose. If the leadership can energise party cadres to make a new beginning on the ground, Bengal could serve as a template for the Congress in other states where it faces similar challenges. One wonders what prevented the Congress leadership from taking this course correction after the 2021 elections drubbing or even after the 2024 Lok Sabha fiasco. Well, better late than never!","In the 2021 assembly elections, the congress could not win even one seat in the 294-member assembly. The congress’s decision to contest solo may signal the party's resolve to take the long and difficult path of revival, but it perhaps ignores the grim ground reality in west bengal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128253448,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1661646,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Congress leader and former Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Thursday alleged that Union home minister Amit Shah had reached out to discuss the cases against the former CM, claiming the move was aimed at persuading him to join the BJP.Responding to questions about his claims that he had received an offer to join the BJP, Baghel said the ruling party uses investigative agencies against opposition leaders and then seeks to politically benefit.“BJP always puts allegations and files FIR against people from the Opposition. ED and IT are weapons of the BJP, and when someone gets trapped in this, the BJP calls them and says that they have a washing machine in which they can come out clean,” Baghel said.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday reprimanded Congress MP Jairam Ramesh for challenging an Office Memorandum issued by the Centre to implement the apex court’s judgment on retrospective environmental clearance.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said that since the Office Memorandum was meant to implement an SC judgment, the challenge was effectively against the judgment itself.“Be ready for exemplary costs. We know the design behind this,” a bench led by CJI Surya Kant said.“Can one challenge a judgment by a writ petition? It is just for media consumption,” the bench added.When the bench warned of exemplary costs, Ramesh withdrew his plea.Last year in May, the top court held that the right to live in a pollution-free atmosphere was part of the fundamental right as it struck down the Centre’s Office Memorandum allowing ex post facto or retrospective environmental clearances to projects in violation of norms.“The Union government, as much as individual citizens, has a constitutional obligation to protect the environment,” the court said.

LOP: Spoke truth in House, won’t back down

NEW DELHI: Congress’ Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said he spoke the truth in Parliament and will not back down even if BJP moves a privilege motion or files a police case against him.In a video, Gandhi said Congress and the country fought for food security, but PM Narendra Modi has betrayed the farmers by “selling out cotton, soybean, apple and fruit growers”. Foreigners have been trying for a long time to capture India’s agriculture market and Modi has opened the doors for them because “Donald Trump controls his reins”.He said farmers in the US have large, mechanised farms and receive govt subsidies, while Indian farmers have small landholdings without mechanised farming and don’t get MSP either.“File a case against me, abuse me, move a privilege motion. It does not matter. I spoke the truth in Parliament. You may not like it, but the country understands the truth. Whatever the govt may do, I am with the farmers and won’t back down. Congress is with the farmers. We won’t allow injustice,” Gandhi said.Congress MP and general secretary KC Venugopal said, “We are not bothered about any motions and if you want to hang us, we are ready for that also. We will continue to tell the truth in Parliament.”He said BJP had taken away Gandhi’s LS membership in 2023, but he bounced back with more votes in the next election.Venugopal also lashed out at Modi govt over removal of parts of Gandhi’s speech from Lok Sabha records. “Whatever Gandhi said is completely expunged from the records. Whatever Nirmala Sitharaman said, the same remarks were included in the records. Govt has double standards... This Parliament is running for the govt, not for the opposition,” he said.Saying that he spoke the truth in Parliament, Rahul Gandhi asserted he will not back down even if BJP moves a privilege motion or files a police case against him. BJP had taken away Rahul’s LS membership in 2023, but he bounced back with more votes, Congress general secretary K C Venugopal said, slamming the govt for expunging parts of Gandhi’s speech.

What are you challenging?”“We know the design behind this. Through a writ petition, you want to seek review of the judgment. Be ready for exemplary cost. This is all for media publicity,” it remarked.The bench said, “The OM is implementing the Nov 18 judgment. So, in effect you are challenging the judgment. Can you challenge a judgment of the SC through a writ petition? ...If you have a grievance against the judgment, you have a remedy to file a review petition, but you can’t file a writ petition challenging a judgment.”Given the choice between exemplary cost and withdrawal of the petition, Khan chose the latter.",Congress mp and former environment minister jairam ramesh had to beat a retreat in supreme court on thursday.

Parliament passes bill to bring legal clarity to labour issues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parliament-passes-bill-to-bring-legal-clarity-to-labour-issues/articleshow/128283847.cms,"NEW DELHI: Parliament on Thursday passed Industrial Relations Code (Amendment) Bill, 2026, seeking to bring legal clarity over labour issues. Both Houses passed the bill by voice vote, even as several opposition members described it as “anti-labour” and accused govt of favouring industrialists over workers while drafting the industrial relations code.BJP and its allies, on the other hand, strongly defended the bill terming it a “historic reform” for the welfare of labourers.Replying to a debate on the bill in Lok Sabha, labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya said the four labour codes implemented nearly three months ago give a guarantee of minimum wage. These codes also ensure compulsory issuance of appointment letters as well as uniform wages for the same work irrespective of gender, he said.Before the bill was passed by RS, leader of the opposition Mallikarjun Kharge said the four codes are a way to steal the rights of workers, and govt has joined hands with corporates to strangle labourers, by threatening job security and increasing working hours.Mandaviya dismissed all charges saying the bill was brought in for legal clarity and Modi govt is committed to protect labourers and workers, and save industries.He said trade unions and workers support it, but those who want to do politics only speak against it. These codes ensure equal wages and rights for men and women, he said.Congress’ Jairam Ramesh said Industrial Relations Code was passed in the din on Sept 23, 2020 by a voice vote. “Today we are amending, with retrospective effect, a law that was passed six years ago. This reflects a complete failure of govt, as this repealing of the old Act should have been done before the new law was passed,” he said.Ramesh said the most significant change being brought about by the amendments is going to enable “ease of firing” and there is “no ease of hiring”.Earlier piloting the bill in Rajya Sabha, Mandaviya said, “When Industrial Relations Code, 2020 was passed, three Acts were subsumed in that”. He informed the House that those laws were Trade Union Act, 1926; Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946; and Industrial Dispute Act, 1947.","Parliament on thursday passed industrial relations code (amendment) bill, 2026.
