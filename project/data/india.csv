From village courts to world stage: How Banu Mushtaq’s stories of women and margins won the booker,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-village-courts-to-world-stage-how-banu-mushtaqs-stories-of-women-and-margins-won-the-booker/articleshow/121328606.cms,"Banu Mushtaq, author of 'Heart Lamp' holds the trophy after winning the International Booker Prize

Banu Mushtaq, a longtime women’s rights advocate and Kannada writer, won the 2025 International Booker Prize for Heartlamp, a collection of short stories drawn from decades of listening to the silences and struggles of Indian women.

In this conversation with Jaya Bhattacharji Rose, she shares why she writes, how pain becomes protest, and what her win means for voices from the margins

Q: Maybe I'll address Banu first. Why did you choose to write fiction?

Q: But it requires more than just listening. It requires something else to make you write and write with the precision that you have.

Q: The ordinariness of the scenarios that you depict in your stories and the violence which is depicted is not necessarily always physical violence.

Q: There is a sense of universality about the kind of violence depicted because Deepa (Bhasthi) has chosen different phases of motherhood or that of a woman's life or a child’s life, isn't it?

Q: Deepa, what was your principle of curation?

Q: The compilation of stories have different phases of a girl or a woman's life. Was that a conscious decision?

Q (to Banu Mushtaq): Writers do tend to put in a bit of their own DNA. They tend to put in a bit of their own experiences. Would it be fair or would it be too far-fetched to say that there are glimpses of semi-autobiographical elements in these stories?

Q (to Deepa Bhasthi): Banu speaks Dakhni, a fascinating mix of Persian, Dehlvi, Marathi, Kannada and Telugu. But your mother tongue is Havyaka, a dialect that harks back to old Kannada and is spoken by a small community of Brahmins from the Arabian coast. But the rhythm of the English flows beautifully. How did this process come about?

A: What else can I do? I cannot provide any relief to the aggrieved women who approach me with a lot of worries, sorrows and while I take up their cause, earlier as an activist and further as an activist-cum-advocate, I do struggle to get them relief, but, at the same time, I want to document it and show the entire world that patriarchy cannot continue to commit violence against women in this way and it has to be stopped.A: I cannot simply forget their issues. It haunts me like anything and it never allows me to be at peace. I want to be a voice to their worries and I want to voice all their issues and say to the entire world that these women should be compensated, they should be liberated and they should be given their due place and you should not perpetrate this type of all violence against them continuously.Stop it. Somebody has to say no. That's what I'm saying.A: Even along with the women's issue, there is the issue of marginalised people. I wanted to show even marginalised people, and those from the minority community, are human beings. They have their own issues, their own problems. I want to share their experiences with the entire world and to bridge the gap and to open a window.A: Yes, I have addressed patriarchy. Patriarchy is prevalent among all sections of society, all communities and it is universal in nature. And I have addressed this patriarchy and I have challenged the power structure which is subjugating women and compelling them to stay within four walls and which is compelling them to adhere to their orders without questions.A: I see translation as a very instinctive process. I'm not sure I am quite able to intellectualise the politics of choice at the moment, at least maybe it's something that I need to think about for a long time. But that said, I'm very interested in the idea of choice when it comes to the practice of translation, because translation is about choosing one this word over that or one phrase over the other. A lot went into the selection of these stories, first and foremost stories that I personally liked as well, because it is important for me to enjoy the stories I'm working with. And then I wanted it to be a career-spanning selection. I wanted to bring a variety of themes that were being explored in these stories. And what was also interesting for me was even though there are different stories, the underlying theme is always the treatment of women under patriarchal systems.A: These were part of the many factors that I was looking into when I was making these choices. So one of the factors was to look into how women were treated in different situations and circumstances. And, the life cycle of a woman from childhood to girlhood to a new wife and and so on. There are interesting things about the multiple roles that are foisted upon a girl child or the periods of discomfort that she can feel.A: In my stories, there are no very serious autobiographical elements, but day-to-day experiences that women shared with me, that has been the raw material for my stories. As an activist and as an advocate, I meet many women every day. They come and talk to me and sometimes I counsel them, sometimes I get them legal relief.They think me as a counsellor and they start telling so many things which are not necessary for a legal drafting.A: Multilinguality is not as rare as we like to think it is, especially in the South Indian context. We engage with a lot of different languages, at least three, and likely more. So, words or phrases from another language creep into our everyday conversations. And I was very clear from the beginning that I wanted to maintain this multilinguality in the translation and not flatten it out into just English, and I was very aware of the musicality of the Kannada language, which i hopefully managed to preserve by retaining some words. And the decision to italicise or not, I think is super important. It is anothering of the language itself when you do it, and when you don't, it sort of blends into the English that the reader is experiencing in the book as well. And I think somewhere along the way, we all seem to have decided that English is this very precious object which must not be touched and played around with. And I wanted to completely reject that premise because we don't speak like the British, we don't speak like the Americans. And I think that is where the musicality is retained. And when you bring in these everyday experiences of multilinguality into a translation by retaining the Dakini or Arabic or Urdu or Kannada or whatever other languages, I think that is where the retaining of the cadence, the musicality, the rhythm, those things remain in the translation.Q (to Banu Mushtaq): You do not capitulate to any form of othering, but you choose to depict life as it is within the community. You bring in the syncretic culture that we live in, a cross-pollination of experiences of our diversity.A: Our culture teaches us, whether it be Hindu or Muslim or Christian or whether it may be Kannadiga or Tamil or Malayali, the culture of human beings, the culture of neighbourhood. So we are Muslims, and if there was a feast the female elders of the family would bring a plate of sweets, coconut, prawn, flowers, everything to share with our neighbours, who were vegetarian. Though they won't take non-veg food, we used to go to their home and we used to offer them sweets and all these types of things. And they would invite us for their feasts. And this culture of coexistence is there even today. The fabric seems to be tarnished, but it remains there. So, there is no question of othering. There is a question of only inclusiveness.","Banu mushtaq, a longtime women’s rights advocate and kannada writer, won the 2025 international booker prize for heartlamp.

BJP win in Chhattisgarh turned the tide in decisive fight against Naxals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-win-in-chhattisgarh-turned-the-tide-in-decisive-fight-against-naxals/articleshow/121328500.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Rendering the CPI(Maoist) headless with the elimination of its top leader Basavaraju , did not come in one single blow but through sustained, intelligence-based strikes aimed at demolishing the Maoist ‘safe havens’ one by one, but which really gathered stream after the change of govt in Chhattisgarh in December 2023.Though home minister Amit Shah had conceived the mission to uproot Left-wing extremism soon after taking over in 2019 — envisaging moving of the security forces into Naxal “strongholds” untouched by administration or policing and introducing the locals there to the Centre’s flagship schemes — the “double engine” model really kicked in with installation of the BJP govt in Chhattisgarh, the state most affected by Maoist violence. Successes had been achieved by then in tackling and eliminating Maoists from their pocket boroughs in Bihar and Jharkhand, and taking the fight to Abujhmad region in Chhattisgarh, where the top Maoist leadership was ensconced, was the next logical step.What has followed after 2023 is seamless coordination between the Centre and its agencies like CRPF, IB and BSF, on the one hand, and the Chhattisgarh govt and state police with its specialised anti-Naxal wings like district reserve guard (DRG) and special taskforce (STF).Over the past one-and-a-half years, these agencies have worked as per a well-laid out strategy to to neutralise the outfit’s senior, middle and lower-rung leadership and cadres, challenge them in what they thought were their “secure” bastions; and push back the Maoists to shrink their area of influence was shrunk to a few pockets dotting the inter-state tri-junctions.The statistics speak for the success of these coordinated efforts — 401 Maoists were neutralised, 1429 were arrested and 1355 surrendered in Chhattisgarh between December 1, 2023 and May 21, 2025.To ensure that the Maoists do not reenter areas freed from their hold, the CRPF has been setting up security camps or forward operating bases (FOBs) there. Since 2019, nearly 555 such camps have been established, increasing security presence and facilitating an administrative push in the surrounding villages. The benefits of development and pressure on the Maoists with sustained operations meanwhile encouraged a wave of surrenders. Maoists, faced with depleted strength due to killing, arrests and surrenders of their cadres, are now appealing for ceasefire and talks. But the Centre is in no mood to relent and is focused on dealing the final blow to Naxalism and eliminating it well within the March 2026 deadline. . Operation Black Forest conducted from April 22 to May 11 and now the Narayanpur operation — which have together eliminated 58 Maoists, including their top leader Basavaraju — are part of that final blow. While Operation Black Forest successfully displaced the senior CPI(Maoist) leadership and the most potent PLGA battalion no 1 from their Karreguttalu Hills hideout on Chhattisgarh-Telangana border, forcing them to take refuge in segregated pockets with a depleted arsenal and supplies, the Narayanapur operation has hit them like never before, rendering the outfit headless.Wednesday’s operation also showcases the success of DRG experiment to utilise surrendered Naxals for anti-Maoist operations. DRG had been taking the lead in joint operations, with its commandos well-versed with the terrain and topography of Maoists’ forest hideouts and familiar with their operational tactics. Armed with pinpointed intelligence, DRG achieved its biggest success on Wednesday — Basavaraju, who according to former CRPF DG K Vijay Kumar operated with Ninja-like stealth, was finally cornered and taken down by the very men who he had once commanded.","Home minister amit shah had conceived the mission to uproot left-wing extremism soon after taking over in 2019.

Oral Contraceptives May Triple Stroke Risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/oral-contraceptives-may-triple-stroke-risk/articleshow/121324081.cms,"New Delhi: Women who use a combined oral contraceptive (COC)—better known as the pill—are three times more likely to suffer an unexpected stroke than those who don't. These new findings were presented at a conference of European Stroke Organisation in Finland's Helsinki on May 20.The pill is a hormonal contraceptive, containing both oestrogen and progestogen , which prevents the ovaries from releasing an egg each month. A research at Istanbul University in Turkiye has established the connection between cryptogenic ischaemic stroke (CIS) and oral contraceptives. The research analysed 268 women, aged 18 to 49 years, who experienced unexpected strokes, comparing them with 268 women in the similar age group without a stroke history.Studies from 2019 and 2022 highlighted similar concerns. The discovery of direct vascular effects of COCs requires immediate attention. Healthcare professionals acknowledge that extended usage periods and increased oestrogen levels heighten stroke risks.Dr Anuradha Kapur, principal director (obstetrics & gynaecology) and head of the unit at Max Smart Super Specialty Hospital, Saket, pointed out that while medicines could notably raise the likelihood of ischaemic strokes, they typically required existing risk elements to cause harm.""Think of it as adding gasoline to a fire that has not yet been lit. If you have a genetic factor or already have a risk factor, the pill can be the trigger,"" she clarified.However, research findings demonstrated that the increased stroke risk associated with oral contraceptive use appears to operate independently, as no significant associations were found between contraceptive usage and other documented risk factors.""Our findings confirm earlier evidence linking oral contraceptives to stroke risk,"" said Dr Mine Sezgin of the neurology department at Istanbul University and the lead author of the study. ""What's particularly notable is that the association remains strong even when accounting for other known risk factors, which suggests there may be additional mechanisms involved—possibly genetic or biological.""Dr Renu Gupta, director of obstetrics and gynaecology at Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute Delhi, emphasised that stroke resulted from multiple factors, including genetic, physiological and lifestyle-related risks. She noted that COC could trigger complications in women with underlying health conditions, including undiagnosed thrombophilias or autoimmune conditions.While the researchers note that further prospective studies are needed, they advise clinicians to exercise caution when prescribing the pill to women with known vascular risk factors or a history of ischaemic stroke.Describing the connection between oral contraceptives and stroke, prof Manjari Tripathi, head of the neurology department at AIIMS, explained that COC usage consistently correlated with increased ischaemic stroke risk, particularly in women with pre-existing health risk factors. COC usage increases ischaemic stroke risk by 1.6 to 2 times, with higher risks in women experiencing migraines with aura. The risk intensifies for women who smoke, have high blood pressure, migraines with aura, or a stroke history. The oestrogen component potentially increases blood coagulability and clot formation.Dr Vinit Suri, senior consultant of neurology at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, noted that first-year usage presented the highest risk, affected by oestrogen dosage. Modern pills contain lower oestrogen levels, reducing risks compared to older formulations, he pointed out. Risk increases with smoking, hypertension or age above 35. Healthy young women face minimal absolute risk, with pregnancy presenting higher stroke risks than oral contraceptives.""The real risk lies in stacking oestrogen on top of other vascular triggers—smoking, uncontrolled hypertension or migraine with aura—where non-oestrogen methods are clearly the wiser bet,"" said Dr Bhaskar Shukla, consultant neurologist at PSRI Hospital. Informed choice, annual check-ups and the growing menu of highly effective LARC devices mean women no longer have to trade peace of mind for modern contraception, he added.","Women who use combined oral contraceptive (coc)—better known as the pill—are three times more likely to suffer an unexpected stroke than those who don't.

NEW DELHI: Top CPI(Maoist) leader Nambala Keshava Rao alias Basavaraju -- the mastermind behind deadly Maoist attacks including the 2010 ambush killing of 75 CRPF personnel and the 2013 Jheeram Ghati massacre involving senior state Congress leaders -- was killed in Narayanpur, Chhattisgarh, on Wednesday in an intelligence-based operation by the state police's district reserve guard (DRG) wing.Announcing the ""landmark achievement"" in the battle to eliminate Naxalism, home minister Amit Shah posted on X: ""Today, in an operation in Narayanpur, Chhattisgarh, our security forces have neutralised 27 dreaded Maoists , including Nambala Keshav Rao, alias Basavaraju, the general secretary of CPI-Maoist, topmost leader, and the backbone of the Naxal movement"".Shah further posted: ""This is the first time in three decades of Bharat's battle against Naxalism that a general secretary-ranked leader has been neutralised by our forces.

Operation Black Forest by the CRPF, Chhattisgarh police and other Central and state forces had neutralised 31 Maoists and led to the recovery of a huge cache of weapons and other Naxal supplies.The home minister on Wednesday shared that after the completion of 21-day Operation Black Forest on May 11, 54 Naxalites have been arrested and 84 Naxalites have surrendered across Chhattisgarh, Telangana, and Maharashtra. ""The Modi government is resolved to eliminate Naxalism before the 31st of March 2026,"" he posted.According to Chhattisgarh police, several encounters were undertaken and recoveries made during the Narayanpur operation, which was on for the past three days.

Further, it refused to stay the investigation against him.The apex court granted interim bail to Mahmudabad subject to furnishing of bail bonds to the satisfaction of CJM, Sonipat.The top court also ordered that he shall not write any online article or make any online speech related to both posts, which are subject matter of investigation.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotisar Singh, while hearing the matter, slammed the professor and asked, ""Why try to gain cheap popularity?""It also questioned Mahmudabad's choice of words and said they were used to humiliate, insult, and put others in discomfort.""Although everybody has the right to freedom of expression, statements by Mahmudabad are what is called dog whistling in law,"" the top court added.""At the time when so many things were happening in the country, where was the occasion for him to use these kinds of words which could be insulting, humiliating and putting others in discomfort. He is a learned man, he cannot be said to be short of words."" it added.SC further directed Haryana DGP to constitute a three-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) within 24 hours and asked the associate professor to join the investigation and fully cooperate.The SIT will comprise three IPS officers, including a woman officer who would be from outside the state.It restrained the professor from making any comments regarding terrorist attacks on Indian soil or the counter-response given by the nation.

Supreme Court Rejects Sri Lankan Tamil's Plea, Says India Not A 'Dharamshala' For Refugees

Poll In your opinion, should there be stricter regulations for civil service applicants regarding reservations? Yes, to prevent misuse. No, current rules are sufficient.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday granted anticipatory bail to former IAS probationer Puja Khedkar, who is accused of cheating in the civil services process by wrongly claiming reservation benefits under the OBC and disability quotas.A bench comprising Justices B V Nagarathna and Satish Chandra Sharma said, ""What is the grave crime she has committed? She is not a drug lord or a terrorist. She has not committed 302 (murder). She is not an NDPS offender. You should have a system or software. You complete the investigation. She has lost everything and will not get a job anywhere.""The Delhi Police and UPSC both had opposed her anticipatory bail, saying she had defrauded the commission and the public. The Delhi High Court also dismissed her anticipatory bail plea, removing her interim protection. The UPSC had canceled her candidature and debarred her from taking any future exams. Central government also formally discharged her from the Indian Administrative Service, citing Rule 12 of the IAS (Probation) Rules.Khedkar came under public and legal scrutiny after her controversial posting in Pune, which was later changed to Washim by the Maharashtra government following allegations of power misuse.Her case took a serious turn when the state’s OBC welfare minister ordered an investigation into her claims of belonging to the OBC non-creamy layer.She is accused of submitting false certificates to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to pass the highly competitive civil services exams. Reports suggest she used multiple certificates showing different disabilities, including mental illness, low vision, and locomotor issues.A major point of concern has been the use of different names during the application process—Khedkar Puja Deeliprao and Puja Manorama Dilip Khedkar—which raised doubts about the number of attempts she made. She was also accused of using the name change to bypass the rule on maximum exam attempts.Before her IAS selection, she was serving as an Indian Revenue Service officer and was posted with the Sports Authority of India. She had previously used the OBC and PwBD (low vision) categories for her IRS post, but later used PwBD (multiple disabilities) and a new OBC certificate to qualify for the IAS.","Former ias probationer puja khedkar is accused of cheating in the civil services process.

The court also observed ""inherent contradictions"" in the wife's statements regarding consent while highlighting the exception of ""implied consent"" in marriage under current rape law.The court observed that Section 377 of the IPC, which penalises certain sexual acts, would not be applicable within a marital relationship, especially in the absence of any allegation of lack of consent.""In the context of a marital relationship, Section 377 of IPC cannot be applied to criminalise non-penile-vaginal intercourse between a husband and wife. Such an interpretation would be in line with the reasoning and observations of the Supreme Court in Navtej Singh Johar (case),"" the court said in its May 13 order.Additionally, it observed that the wife had not explicitly stated whether the act was committed against her will or without her consent.The wife alleged that the husband was ""impotent"" and claimed their marriage was part of a conspiracy by him and his father to establish illicit relations and extort money from her family.In response, the husband maintained that the marriage was legally valid and that there was an implied presumption of consent for consensual sexual acts within it, which could not attract charges under Section 377.Noting an ""inherent contradiction"" in the wife's statements, the judge pointed out that she simultaneously accused the man of sexual incapacity while also alleging that he had performed oral sex.""The essential ingredient of lack of consent – central to constituting an offence under Section 377 of IPC post-Navtej Singh Johar (case) between any two adults – is clearly missing. Thus, there is not only a lack of prima facie case, but even the threshold of strong suspicion is not met,"" the court said.""No prima facie case is made out against the petitioner for the offence under Section 377 of IPC. The impugned order directing the framing of charge is, therefore, unsustainable in law and is liable to be set aside,"" it added.The court further noted that acts like anal or oral intercourse fall within the scope of rape under Section 375(a) of the IPC, but also clarified that there was no reason to believe the petitioner would not be covered by the legal immunity granted to husbands under the exception to the rape provision.""There is no basis to assume that a husband would not be protected from prosecution under Section 377 of IPC, in view of exception 2 to Section 375 of IPC since the law (amended Section 375 of IPC) now presumes implied consent for sexual intercourse as well as sexual acts, including anal or oral intercourse within a marital relationship,"" it said.","Delhi high court quashed an order regarding prosecution of a husband under section 377 for performing ""unnatural"" sex with his wife.

'Congress party donors were cheated'

National Herald Case: ED Notice to Congress an Assault on Democracy, Says Kapil Sibal

'Young Indian company a sham'

'Accused enjoyed proceeds of crime'

Matter listed for day-to-day hearing

NEW DELHI: The Rouse Avenue court on Wednesday began hearing the Enforcement Directorate ’s (ED) prosecution complaint against Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi , and others in the National Herald money laundering case.The matter is linked to alleged financial irregularities in the transfer of a Rs 90.25 crore loan from the Indian National Congress (INC) to Associated Journals Ltd (AJL), the publisher of the National Herald, and its subsequent assignment to Young Indian for a mere Rs 50 lakh.During the hearing on Wednesday, the ED alleged that the transaction was a criminal conspiracy aimed at misappropriating assets worth over Rs 2,000 crore.In the opening submissions, additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju argued that the offence of money laundering was clearly made out in the case.“There was a proceeds of crime,” he submitted, asserting that criminal activity continued for the purpose of generating such proceeds, thereby constituting the offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), reported news agency ANI.The court, presided by special judge Vishal Gogne, asked pointed queries to the ED during the hearing. It sought clarity on the ownership of AJL's assets, specifically whether the company’s shareholders could be considered its owners.Are assets owned by company or shareholders? Who owns the property as of today? the court asked ED's special counsel, Zoheb Hossain.In simple words, if the property of A is usurped by B, does it become proceeds of crime when it was clean in the hands of A, the court asked.""Are wrongful acts ascribed to individuals but not parties (Congress)? Or is the party a victim?” the judge asked. In response, Hosain said, “The donors of the party are victims"".Hossain further said that donations and membership fees were collected from the public for party purposes, but were instead diverted as a loan to a company engaged in commercial activities.He argued this as part of the predicate offence, stressing that “the donors of the Congress party were cheated.”Reading from ED’s complaint, ASG Raju highlighted that Young Indian was formed as a sham entity, ""a cloak to convert public money to personal use"", and used as a special purpose vehicle to gain control over assets of AJL worth Rs 2,000 crore.Raju alleged that the accused acted in ""consortium with each other to achieve the said nefarious purpose"".The court was also informed that the alleged proceeds of crime included rental income worth Rs 142 crore received by the accused.“Proceeds of crime not only include those properties obtained from the scheduled offence, but also any other criminal activity related to the proceeds of crime,” Hossain submitted.Submitting that the alleged offence in the complaint is money laundering, ASG Raju argued that he will show that the offence of money laundering is made out.During the hearing, Raju also confirmed that the complaint was filed under Sections 44 and 45 of the PMLA, involving seven accused individuals, including ex-Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, her son Rahul Gandhi, Gandhi family loyalist Sam Pitroda , and two firms.When the judge asked whether Pitroda was represented in court, ASG responded that if not, proceedings would continue without him.Raju said that there is a proceed of crime. Money laundering is a continuing activity. He said that if an offence is committed of generating proceeds of crime and involves a continuing activity, it is money laundering.He said that the attachment of properties took place in November 2023. Till then, the accused were enjoying the proceeds of crime.The special judge listed the matter for day-to-day hearings on the point of cognisance of the ED’s prosecution complaint from July 2 to July 8. The scheduling followed requests from the defence counsel, including senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who sought a July hearing, citing voluminous documents running over 5,000 pages.“This is an MP/MLA court, and matters are to be heard on a weekly basis,” the judge said, noting that the court would first complete the ED’s arguments, followed by submissions from the defence.Hossain further submitted that Gandhis, Sonia and Rahul, held 76 per cent of Young Indian’s shares, and by paying just Rs 50 lakh, the entity acquired control over Rs 90.25 crore, thus demonstrating the alleged offence of cheating.He also pointed to the AJL's letter to Moti Lal Vohra stating it could not repay the loan due to suspension of its publication. Despite this, further loans were sanctioned, he said, referencing the ED’s evidence including seized documents and Rs 51 lakh in cash.The ED recently filed its prosecution complaint against Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Sam Pitroda, Suman Dubey, Young Indian, and others, alleging offences of money laundering stemming from the manipulation of AJL's finances and control.","The matter is linked to alleged financial irregularities in the transfer of a rs 90.25 crore loan from the indian national congress to associated journals ltd.

Waqf boards and Hindu endowment boards can't be compared: Centre in SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/waqf-boards-and-hindu-endowment-boards-cant-be-compared-centre-in-sc/articleshow/121324856.cms,"NEW DELHI:

After countering the Muslim side's argument that non-Muslims could theoretically form a majority in the Central Waqf Council and Auqaf Boards, Centre told Supreme Court Wednesday that an ill-founded attempt was made to project discrimination of Muslims by comparing composition of waqf bodies with religious endowment boards of Hindus, Sikhs and Christians.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta exhibited documents, including the minority affairs ministry's written assurance to the Joint Parliamentary Committee and its affidavit in SC, to apprise a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih that the council and boards would never lose their minority character as an overwhelming majority of members would always be Muslims.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal had taken nearly 30 minutes on Tuesday to highlight apprehension among Muslims about the council and boards losing their minority character by claiming that the govt, through the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025, at least theoretically intended to make non-Muslims the majority in these two bodies. He had asked when the govt never attempted to make non-believers in Hinduism, Sikhism and Christianity members in their religious endowment boards, why were waqfs of Muslims singled out. He termed it discrimination on the ground of religion, which violated the fundamental right to non-discrimination guaranteed under Article 15.Mehta said Hindu religious endowment board members entered temples and even supervised rituals.The charity commissioner, who can be non-Hindu, can appoint archakas (pujaris) and remove them for not performing rituals or for immoral activities, and SC had upheld this by terming appointment of archakas as a secular activity, he added.The SG said Hindu personal laws were codified in 1956, but Muslims continued to be governed by Sharia law. Adjudicating a petition highlighting this discrimination, SC in 1996 had said such a comparison was not possible and reforms in personal law and religious activities were a gradual process.""There cannot be any comparison with Hindu religious endowment boards as they deal with religion and rituals. But the boards deal with management of waqf properties, which is a secular activity, and the state has the power to regulate it through legislation. None of the petitioners has challenged Parliament's legislative competence to enact the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025,"" the SG said.He said the JPC had consulted Archaeological Survey of India on ancient monuments being taken out of the purview of waqf. ASI said while religious activities, which have been going on for years, had not been stopped in protected and ancient monuments, waqf boards managing these monuments as waqfs had unilaterally allowed commercial activities in these ancient spaces, hindering preservation and conservation works.Mehta said in certain cases, waqf boards had restrained ASI from carrying out repair and restoration work in ancient monuments.","Centre says attempt was made to project discrimination of muslims by comparing composition of waqf bodies with religious endowment boards of hindus, sikhs and christians.

CHENNAI: A vacation bench of Madras high court Wednesday clamped an interim stay on operation of amendments to 10 state university laws empowering the CM to appoint vice-chancellors, effectively wresting what is the governor's prerogative in the capacity of chancellor.The contentious provision, which was deemed to have received Supreme Court's assent based on its ruling defining gubernatorial powers, triggered a rare presidential reference recently and a renewed Centre-state power tussle. The bench of Justice G R Swaminathan and Justice V Lakshminarayanan passed the interim orders on a PIL filed by advocate K Venkatachalapathy, challenging the amendments on the ground that these were contrary to the objectives of UGC regulations and functions.""Through Regulation 7.3 of the UGC Regulations for teaching staff, the commission granted power to the chancellor (Governor) to appoint VCs...,"" the PIL states.However, the state, through the amendments, replaced the power of the chancellor with the govt, which is contrary to the process stipulated for appointing VCs,"" the PIL states.""State universities are recognised as universities within Sec 2 (f) of the UGC Act and also recognised by the commission under the applicable regulations. Therefore, any amendments made by state affecting such universities, especially in areas already covered by regulation concerning appointment of VCs, constitute a violation of constitutional distribution of powers,"" it argues.Senior advocate Dama Seshadri Naidu, representing the petitioner, contended at Wednesday's hearing that universities must be protected from political powers. ""The chancellor is apolitical, like a speaker of an assembly... Education should be in the hands of an authority above politics,"" he said.Advocate general P S Raman and senior advocate P Wilson, representing the state, argued that a legislation brought by the govt after getting it passed in the assembly could be stayed only in the event of ""a glaring unconstitutionality or if it is manifestly arbitrary"". ""In the present case, a state legislation prevails over regulations framed by UGC,"" the AG said.So long as it does not contravene a law legislated by Parliament, the state law prevails, he added. Wilson sought an adjournment, saying a petition to transfer all related cases to SC was pending and that arguing the matter now before HC would leave the pending pleas infructuous. He said there was no urgency for a vacation bench to hear the PIL, and requested the court to adjourn the hearing and provide time for the state to file a counter.Wilson accused governor R N Ravi of ""waging war"" against DMK govt. ""The PIL is politically motivated. Except for a grudge to stay the selection process, there is no urgency in issue. Only the process for appointment of vice-chancellors has commenced.

NEW DELHI: Producing historical proof that the law mandated registration of all kinds of waqf properties, including those in the 'waqf by user' category, since 1923, Centre on Wednesday told Supreme Court that the legal requirement was deliberately flouted to subserve vested interests, a menace sought to be eradicated by the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta punched holes in submissions of senior advocate Kapil Sibal , who is the lead counsel for the Muslim side challenging the validity of the 2025 law, by pointing out how the petitioners had attempted to portray falsehood and mislead a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih. Mehta said Sibal had made false statements or suppressed provisions relating to several issues.Solicitor General Mehta said senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who is the lead counsel for the Muslim side, had made false statements or suppressed provisions relating to several issues - the content of bill placed in Parliament after incorporating JPC recommendations, ancient Islamic monuments being made out of bounds for religious activities of Muslims, non-Muslims in Waqf Council and Boards, inquiry into waqf land in dispute, and identification of govt land treated as waqf - to project a misleading picture before court.Living up to Sibal's prophecy on Tuesday that if he raised 10 questions on validity of the 2025 Act, the SG would have 11 answers to it, Mehta said the fact that only a Muslim could create a waqf and it must be registered had been mandatory since 1923. However, before the 2014 LS elections, the UPA govt in Dec 2013 amended Waqf Act, 1995, to allow anyone to make a waqf, ostensibly to appease Muslims and for vote-bank politics.Sibal had on Tuesday argued that the requirement for registration of waqf properties had been inserted in the new law in order to appropriate properties of Muslims.""How can someone declare another person's property, even if it had been used for a long time, as a waqf? How can someone declare an encroached govt land as waqf? Should there be no inquiry and proof be asked about it?"" Mehta asked, adding that none of the affected parties had approached the SC and that the challenge was through PILs.He said the govt had appointed a three-member committee comprising distinguished persons to study the waqf property mismanagement issue. In its detailed report in 1976, the committee said concealment of waqf and wilful non-registration of waqf properties was a deeply prevailing malady in administration of waqfs. The committee had recommended that if a waqf was not registered, then the mutawalli could not file a suit.Mehta said in 1984, Parliament amended the Waqf Act and provided that no suit would be maintainable in relation to an unregistered waqf. But because of political reasons, this amendment was never brought into force, Mehta said. ""This provision was there in the Waqf Act, 1995, but was deleted by the 2013 amendment Act,"" he added, referring to the changes the UPA govt carried out before the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.He rubbished Sibal's argument that once a govt officer declares a property not to be a waqf, without any judicial adjudication, the Muslims had no remedy. Mehta said every process of identification of govt land or private property was subject to the provisions of Civil Procedure Code and amenable to challenge before a court of law.For govt or a private party to get title over its land, wrongly identified as waqf property and in possession of a waqf, concerned person must approach a civil court for getting ownership title over it, which is a judicial process.He said the minority affairs ministry had assured the JPC in writing and filed an affidavit before the SC declaring that a maximum of four out of total 22 members in the Central Waqf Council and three out of 11 in state Auqaf Boards could be non-Muslims. ""This does not alter the minority character of the council and boards,"" he said, refuting the argument that the number of Muslims on waqf bodies would come down substantially under the new law.He said the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act of 1904 and 1958 categorically stated that the religious character of ancient and protected monuments, which are more than 100 years old, would not change, irrespective of their status as waqf property. The arguments will continue on Thursday.",Solicitor general tushar mehta punched holes in submissions of senior advocate kapil sibal. Sibal is the lead counsel for the muslim side challenging the validity of the 2025 law. He had argued that the requirement for registration of waqf properties had been inserted in the new law in order to appropriate properties of muslims.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121324800,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-98608,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
