Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala, second only to West Bengal in venomous snake diversity nationwide, has declared snakebite envenomation a disease of public health importance, requiring mandatory hospital reporting of cases, strengthening anti-venom supply chains and standardising treatment protocols.Kerala HC directed the state govt recently to make snakebite a notifiable disease within two months in accordance with a circular issued by Union health ministry in Nov 2024. The Sept 26 order came on two petitions filed in 2019 after a Class 5 student suffered a fatal snakebite at a govt school in Wayanad that year.Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are two other states that have declared snakebite envenomation a notifiable condition. In Kerala, its inclusion in the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme under Section 28(3) of the Kerala Public Health Act, 2023, makes it a structured health priority.The state records over 3,000 critical snakebite incidents annually. Between 8,000 and 12,000 people are admitted to govt hospitals each year for treatment of snakebites, according to reports from the National Health Mission.Official data from SARPA, the forest department's ""snake awareness, rescue and protection"" app, shows 334 snakebite deaths between 2017 and 2019, averaging 110 fatalities a year.The number of deaths dropped to 76 in 2020, 40 in 2021 and 42 in 2022.The classification empowers coordinated action between departments and improved medical response mechanisms. Clinical management and reporting will follow the National Centre for Disease Control's updated national guidelines for management of snakebite, published in 2022.Kerala's rural and agricultural regions face continued risk from venomous snakes. Apart from the Russell's viper, cobra, krait and saw-scaled viper, the venom of hump-nosed pit viper - unique to the Western Ghats - is linked to severe renal complications and underreported deaths, says a 2021 study in Journal of the Association of Physicians of India.WHO recognised snakebite envenomation as a Neglected Tropical Disease in 2017 and urged countries to halve related deaths and disabilities by 2030. Kerala's new classification aligns state health policy with WHO's global strategy.The state's SARPA platform connects citizens to certified rescuers, records verified incident data and provides guidance on safe first response. The initiative, which integrates trained snake handlers, emergency rescue teams and hospital alert systems, is believed to have driven the decline in fatalities in recent years.","Kerala hc directed the state govt recently to make snakebite a notifiable disease.

Return of firecrackers? Why green activists are not bursting with joy

NEW DELHI: A mix of anticipation and anxiety has gripped Delhi with the Supreme Court hinting that it may allow the sale of green crackers in the city just a week before Diwali. The apex court is likely to deliver its verdict on Monday. While many residents welcomed the prospect of fireworks returning to the skies, calling it an essential part of festive celebrations, others expressed concern that weak enforcement could once again pave the way for regular, more polluting and noisier crackers - turning the city into a ""gas chamber and boom box"".When TOI visited several key markets, shopkeepers said they didn't have firecrackers - green or not - in stock, but many claimed that ""others are selling it"".The permission, likely to be granted, would bring back the bursting of crackers within the legal ambit for Diwali, Gurpurab and Christmas after five years. Green firecrackers are designed to emit 20-30% less particulate matter than conventional ones, but experts argue that they still release harmful pollutants and are difficult to regulate effectively. They warn that enforcement of such selective permissions could prove challenging, given Delhi's already strained pollution control mechanisms.SC last week reserved its order on the sale of green crackers after earlier, in Sept, allowing certified manufacturers to produce them in Delhi-NCR. Manufacturers welcomed the development, recalling how a complete ban during last Diwali led to widespread use of conventional fireworks despite restrictions. They argue that bringing green crackers back into the market could help formalise the trade and reduce illegal manufacturing.According to Rajeev Kumar Jain, a member of Delhi Fireworks Traders Association, the move could curb black marketing and encourage safer options. ""There's a reason the Chief Justice said that if they don't permit crackers, a mafia will be created. Those engaged in illegal work must face the law, but allowing green crackers gives people cleaner and safer choices. Like food has FSSAI certification and jewellery has hallmarking, firecrackers too can have checks and balances. The goal should be to offer people better alternatives rather than push them toward illegal and more harmful options,"" he said.Jain added that innovations have significantly improved the new range of green crackers, with 80-90% of the same varieties and effects - sky shots, chakris, showers - but with a modified composition that converts emissions into water vapour. ""There's huge demand across India, not just during Diwali. From Janto Dec, there are at least 20 festivals where fireworks are used, cutting across regions and religions. But only Diwali faces such scrutiny, which feels unfair,"" he said.However, environmentalists and health experts remain deeply sceptical. Activist Bhavreen Kandhari argued that even so-called green crackers are far from safe.""Science, economics and common sense all point to the same truth - there is nothing truly 'green' about green crackers. The CSIR-NEERI's own data shows only about a 30% drop in emissions, and that too under controlled lab conditions. In Delhi's winter, when pollution gets trapped under a blanket of cold air, that reduction becomes meaningless. A single night of fireworks can poison the air for days. Allowing crackers, green or otherwise, means asking the youngest and oldest among us to pay the price for nostalgia. Clean air is not a privilege - it's a constitutional right under Article 21,"" she said.Parents of young children echoed similar concerns. Neha G Jain, a mother of two aged two and nine, urged the court to prioritise public health over festivity. ""Children are already suffering from toxic air, battling asthma and lung disease. The so-called 'balanced approach' tilts toward manufacturers, not the vulnerable population of NCR. My children depend on nebulisers daily. The polluted air doesn't care whether a cracker is labelled 'green' or not - it harms them all the same. Diwali can be just as beautiful without crackers,"" she said.Experts also fear this Diwali could be more polluted than the last, given that air quality has already started dipping following the withdrawal of the monsoon. Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst at think tank EnviroCatalysts, warned that allowing even green crackers could worsen the situation.""With the emission load from other sectors like transport, power, and construction likely to be higher this year, any relaxation on crackers - green or otherwise - will make matters worse. The city is already struggling with deteriorating air quality, and any added pollution will push it deeper into the severe category,"" he said.According to the CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, green crackers are made by reducing the size of the shell, eliminating ash and using additives that act as dust suppressants. These crackers can be identified by a green CSIR-NEERI logo and encrypted QR codes on the packaging to ensure authenticity. However, a Delhi Technological University study in 2022 found that even green crackers release high concentrations of ultrafine particles which can easily penetrate deep into the lungs.","Sc last week reserved its order on the sale of green crackers after earlier, in sept, allowing certified manufacturers to produce them in delhi-ncr.

GURGAON: A 21-year-old labourer died after being crushed under a pile of iron rods that fell from a trailer at a construction site near Ambience Mall on Saturday.According to police, the incident occurred around 4 pm in the DLF 3 area, where a private company is constructing a multi-storey building.

16 senior IAS, IPS officers mentioned in 'suicide note'

CHANDIGARH: Police on Sunday pressed a more stringent section of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act in the case related to the alleged suicide of IPS officer Y Puran Kumar, following strong objections from his wife Amneet Kumar.Amneet had accused police of ""diluting"" the case by invoking Section 3(1)(r) of the SC/ST Act - which carries a minimum six-month jail term, extendable to five years - instead of Section 3(2)(v), which provides for life imprisonment if the offence is motivated by caste.Puran Kumar, 52, a 2001-batch Haryana cadre officer, was found dead at his Chandigarh home on October 7.Accepting the demand of Amneet Kumar, wife of IPS officer Y Puran Kumar who allegedly died by suicide, SSP Chandigarh Kanwardeep Kaur said Sunday Section 3(2)(v) has now been added ""in addition to"" existing charges.

IPS Officer 'Suicide': Wife Seeks FIR Against Haryana DGP, Rohtak SP Over 'Harassment And Abetment'

Body taken to mortuary but autopsy put off

Pressure on Haryana governement to take action against DGP

CHANDIGARH: In the strongest commitment yet of action in the alleged suicide of senior IPS officer Y Puran Kumar, Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini warned on Saturday that no one will be spared, “no matter how influential”.The CM’s statement came hours after Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya was removed from his post. Bijarniya has not been given any posting and will be attached to police HQ in Panchkula. Bijarniya and Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur were named in Puran Kumar’s suicide note and his wife IAS officer Amneet P Kumar’s complaint to policeas the alleged “harassers” who drove him to suicide.Amneet has refused to allow an autopsy of her husband’s body until action is taken against the DGP & SP. It has been nearly five days since Puran Kumar’s suicide. On Saturday evening, while addressing the BJP state executive in Panchkula, Saini began by offering condolences to the deceased IPS officer. He expressed solidarity with the IPS officer’s family and said: “Our governement will conduct a thorough investigation into this matter.” He urged the opposition not to play politics.Chandigarh police faced backlash from the family of the IPS officer when it tried to get an autopsy done on Saturday, leading DGP Sagarpreet Hooda to say that the postmortem would not be conducted until the family agreed, reports Pawan Tiwari.Wife Amneet’s brother Amit Rattan, an AAP MLA, alleged police shifted the body without notifying the kin. The body was moved to PGI mortuary, where a team was ready for an autopsy. However, the family’s objection forced police put it on hold. DGP Hooda, IG Pushpendra Kumar & SSP Kanwardeep Kaur went to Amneet to get her nod, but she refused.Amneet P Kumar was a member of Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini’s delegation on an official tour of Japan when her husband, Y Puran Kumar, allegedly shot himself dead. She flew home immediately. On returning from Japan, CM Saini had called on Amneet at her Chandigarh residence.During the meeting, Amneet had handed him a two-page letter seeking justice and protection for her family and action against those named in the suicide note, especially DGP Shatrujeet Kapur and then Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya, for abetting her husband’s “suicide”. Two days later, on Saturday, Haryana governement removed Bijarniya and replaced him with IPS officer Surinder Singh Bhoria. This was the first action initiated by governement. Pressure is mounting on the governement to take action against Kapur as well. There is intense speculation that he may be asked to go on leave, but till Saturday evening there was no word from governement.The question in bureaucratic circles is whether governement will take action against the DGP. A section of Haryana IAS officers has also demanded Kapur’s arrest. Amneet said a “false FIR” registered in Rohtak was the “trigger point” for her husband’s “suicide”. Bijarniya was the supervising officer of the case in which head constable Sushil Kumar, PSO to Puran Kumar when he was IG Rohtak, was arrested on allegations of extortion. Police claimed Sushil had “confessed” during questioning that he had demanded money on behalf of Puran Kumar.A day after the IPS officer died, Bijarniya said, “The complainant provided audio-visual evidence which led to Sushil’s arrest. He was taken into custody for two days and confessed to demanding on behalf of Kumar. We were in the process of further investigation when we came to know about this incident (Kumar’s alleged suicide).” Kumar was shifted out as IGP (Rohtak range) on September 29. Sushil was arrested soon after. A day after the FIR was lodged, Kumar allegedly died by suicide.

Congress questions 'respect' for allies



Weeks of negotiation



NEW DELHI: The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar has finalised its seat-sharing for the upcoming assembly elections, after days of intense negotiations among allies.After earlier demanding 15 seats for his party, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) chief and Union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi struck a somewhat contradictory tone following the seat-sharing announcement. While he expressed satisfaction with the six seats allotted to HAM(S), he also suggested that the NDA had undervalued his party and warned that such decisions could have repercussions within the alliance.""What the high command decided, we accept, but by giving six seats, they have undervalued us, it may have repercussions in NDA,"" he said.""In Parliament, we were given one seat, still we were happy. Here, we have been given six seats, and we respect the decision of the leadership.""""We are satisfied with what we have been allotted and we have no complaints,"" he added.Prior to the announcement, all eyes were on Chirag Paswan's LJP (RV), Union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi led HAM(S). While Chirag made a strong pitch for a larger share by leveraging his party’s 100% strike rate in Bihar during the recent Lok Sabha elections, Manjhi sought dignity and recognition, reportedly demanding at least 15 seats to maintain HAM(S)’s previous strike rate from the 2020 Assembly polls.The final seat allocation was announced by Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan was: BJP and Janata Dal (United) will contest on 101 seats each, while Chirag Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) will field candidates on 29 seats. Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and Upendra Kushwaha’s Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM) will contest six seats each.Congress latched onto the seat-sharing announcement criticising NDA's 'treatment' of smaller allies.“What has Manjhi ji been saying over the past 15 days? His community was allocated 6 seats in the NDA. Upendra Kushwaha got 6 seats, indicating NDA assigned this many to the Kushwaha community. Does this mean the Kushwaha community is worth only 6 seats in Bihar?” Congress leader Manoj Kumar asked.Kumar further questioned if Chirag Paswan, who reportedly sought 40 seats, was truly respected with 29. Accusing the NDA of undermining key caste groups, he claimed the alliance had been “preparing to deal with” its allies rather than honouring them.""This was done because preparations were underway in the NDA to deal with these people... Jitan Ram Manjhi asked for respect, so did he receive it with 6 seats?"" he questioned.The seat-sharing announcement followed intense parleys in New Delhi over the weekend, involving top NDA figures including BJP president JP Nadda, Union ministers Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh, and Bihar leaders such as deputy CM Samrat Choudhary and state BJP chief Dilip Jaiswal.While BJP has sacrificed some seats (down from 110 in 2020), it seems to have emerged as the dominant partner in terms of influence, evident in how it brokered peace among allies and ensured cohesion ahead of the two-phase elections scheduled for November 6 and 11. Vote counting will take place on November 14.On the other side of the political aisle, the INDIA bloc led by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) is yet to finalise its seat-sharing formula. RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, his son Tejashwi Yadav, and wife Rabri Devi have travelled to Delhi amid reports of tension with the Congress, which is pushing to contest close to 70 seats—similar to its 2020 tally, when it won 19.","Bihar elections: nda announces seat sharing deal; bjp, jdu get 101 seats each; ljp(r) bags 29 seats.

KOLKATA: Allowing a girl student to step out of a campus ""located in a forested area"" past midnight is ""shocking"", Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said Sunday while taking the authorities of a private medical college in Durgapur to task for the circumstances leading to her alleged gang rape late Friday.""How did they (the girl and a male friend) come out of the campus at 12.30 am? Wasn't it the responsibility of the college? I don't know why they were allowed to leave at that hour,"" she said in her first reaction to the crime involving the second-year MBBS student from Odisha.The CM, who had to contend with a public uproar and a prolonged doctors' agitation after Aug 2024 rape-murder of a medical resident studying for her PG at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, said it isn't possible for cops to be present everywhere at all times of the day. She urged students from other states to be ""careful and not venture out of campuses in forested areas late at night"" since they might be unfamiliar with the local terrain.Mamata's remarks coincided with the arrest of three suspects in Durgapur case. The survivor's male friend is being detained for further interrogation. ""No one (linked with the crime) will be spared,"" the CM said, adding, ""Cops are searching for everyone involved.All the guilty will be punished strictly."" The CM directed private institutes to accept responsibility for safety of their students, especially women. ""They should not be allowed to get out (at night). They have to be cautious themselves, too, more so if the campus is in an area like this (Durgapur's outskirts).""She iterated that Bengal had a ""zero-tolerance policy"" on crimes targeting women, mentioning in the same breath some recent such cases in BJP-governed states. Mamata said in Bengal, police and other agencies had submitted charge sheets against arrested suspects in sexual assault cases within two months.

BENGALURU: Following children's deaths in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan linked to consumption of cough syrups, World Health Organization (WHO) has warned of potential risk of contaminated products being exported to other countries, especially through unregulated channels.In response to WHO's October 1 letter, Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) confirmed that the killer chemical, diethylene glycol (DEG), was detected in at least three oral syrup medicines, but ""none of the products were exported from India"".DEG and ethylene glycol (EG) are toxic substances used as industrial solvents and antifreeze agents. They can be fatal even in small amounts, especially for children. The contaminated products were identified as Coldrif, Respifresh TR, and ReLife.A WHO spokesperson told TOI while there is currently no evidence the products were exported through such channels, the risk ""cannot be ruled out"". ""National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) are therefore encouraged to conduct targeted market surveillance, particularly in informal and unregulated markets,"" the spokesperson said.Asked about precedents, the spokesperson mentioned none, adding: ""There is currently no reliable mechanism to verify whether products have been exported through illicit or unregulated channels - precisely because such exports typically leave no formal trace. This is what makes the risk particularly concerning.""Meanwhile, Karnataka health minister Dinesh Gundu Rao said the state began its random checks in Sept and ""almost 300-400 samples"" were drawn across state. ""None of them showed NSQ,"" he said.Rao said syrups even suspected to be contaminated have been banned in the state. Last week, the state's food safety and drug administration issued a circular to all stakeholders not to prescribe, sell, or purchase ReLife and Respifresh TR. Similar instructions were issued for Coldrif on October 4.","Children's deaths in madhya pradesh and rajasthan linked to consumption of cough syrups.

""""The girl was studying in a private medical college. How she came out at night at 12:30? So far I know, it (the incident) happened in a forest area. Investigation is on.

NASHIK: A half-hour trek uphill, a line of women waiting in the midday heat for an OTP that rarely arrives. Their eyes fixed on a phone tied to a tree - praying for a single bar of signal. Digital welfare dream meets patchy network reality in the tribal heartland of Maharashtra's Nandurbar district as hundreds of beneficiaries are trying to complete the state-mandated e-KYC process to keep receiving their monthly Ladki Bahin Yojana payout.In Kharde Khurd village of Dhadgaon taluka, women walk nearly 30 minutes uphill to find a patch of signal. Over 500 beneficiaries from the Bhamane group gram panchayat and Kharde Khurd are forced to wait in the sun, hoping the phone - secured on a tree - will connect to a network, often from across the border in Gujarat or MP. Success rate: below 5%.We've set up a camp here, this is the only place where the mobile catches data,"" said Rakesh Pawara, co-founder of Ulgulan Foundation, an NGO. ""But the verification fails most of the time.""State govt's decision to make e-KYC mandatory has left beneficiaries in remote areas scrambling. Websites load slowly, OTPs take ages, and the Aadhaar-linked verification process times out repeatedly.""Out of more than 100 women trying, only five or 10 get through,"" said a volunteer at the site. For women like Usha Pawara, each attempt is an ordeal. ""To reach the taluka office in Dhadgaon, we trek and then pay Rs 300 for transport. It's not possible for us,"" she said.Deputy CM Ajit Pawar reiterated Friday that the e-KYC is non-negotiable. ""Only verified beneficiaries will receive funds,"" he told reporters in Pune. ""I know there are difficulties, but there is no alternative. The deadline can be extended if needed, but completion is mandatory."" The current cut-off is Nov 15.The directive follows growing frustration across rural Maharashtra - OTP failures, patchy internet, and confusion over cases involving divorced or deceased family members. ""No clarity exists on what to do in such cases. These are genuine concerns,"" an NGO worker said.Dhadgaon tehsildar Dnyaneshwar Sapkale admitted the difficulties. ""Mobile towers came up four-five months ago, but connectivity is still weak. We've asked operators to fix the issue. We're helping women through common service centres and Aadhaar operators,"" he said.Women and child development minister Aditi Tatkare recently announced that the Sept payout had started and reminded beneficiaries to complete e-KYC at ladkibahin.maharashtra.gov.in within two months.

Maharashtra specifies minimum size for fish that can be sold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-specifies-minimum-size-for-fish-that-can-be-sold/articleshow/124512313.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: In a move to arrest netting of juvenile fish that has been adversely affecting their reproduction and eventually depleting the state’s annual catch, Maharashtra government, with the help of Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, has officially decided on length as a criterion for fish to be caught or netted for selling in market yards.Catching a fish that is not fully grown and does not attain a minimum legal size (MLS) as decided by the state will now attract action from the fisheries department. For example, the state’s official fish, silver pomfret, and bangda (Indian mackerel) must be 14cm long.Similarly, a prawn should be 9cm long. The length of Bombay duck should be 18cm whereas for surmai, MLS is 37cm. Maharashtra is the second state after Kerala to introduce the fish length criteria.Sources said a stricter ban on juvenile fishing during the recent monsoon led to a sudden rise in the overall catch during the post-monsoon season, prompting the administration to take the decision. “This is because it gave fish enough time to grow and reproduce, eventually making them flourish. Even stocks have improved,” said a senior fisheries official. Sources said in the premonsoon period this year, the state received 995 tonnes of pomfret stock.However, after five months of total control on fishing, the post-monsoon stock has gone up by over four times, with average length much more than what has been decided. “So, the earlier Rs 11 crore business between March and May now stands at over Rs 350 crore and counting,” a source added. Recently, state minister of fisheries and ports Nitesh Rane chaired a review meeting on MLS of fish and the ongoing conservation measures to curb juvenile fishing of Indian silver pomfret (Pampus candidus).Rane emphasised on the need for a large-scale awareness and compliance campaign to ensure the effective implementation of MLS norms, which, he said, were also vital for the sustainability of the species and the livelihood of the fishing community. A poster on sizes of various fish types was released with an aim to create awareness among fishers, traders, and coastal communities about conserving juvenile fish and adhering to MLS guidelines for long-term fisheries sustainability, said an official.","Catching a fish that is not fully grown and does not attain a minimum legal size (mls) will now attract action from the fisheries department.

PATNA: Barely five days left for the close of nominations for the first phase of Bihar assembly polls, a seat-sharing deal continued to elude the opposition INDIA bloc on Sunday as RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his son Tejashwi Yadav reached New Delhi in connection with a case of alleged irregularities in the award of IRCTC contracts during the former’s tenure as railway minister.The duo, along with former CM Rabri Devi and others, are scheduled to appear before the court on Monday, when the order on framing of charges is likely to be pronounced. The court appearance comes amid efforts to finalise seat-sharing among the INDIA bloc allies, which include Congress , the Left and the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP). Tejashwi said the visit to the national capital was solely because of the court summons.Lalu, however, maintained that talks on seat-sharing were still underway. Sources said the issue is stuck as the Congress is unwilling to settle for fewer than 60 seats, while RJD is equally reluctant to concede. In the 2020 assembly elections, Congress contested 70 seats but won only 19, with a strike rate of 27.14%, a key reason why RJD is hesitant to spare many seats. Sources added that Congress became firm in its demand after witnessing large crowds during the fortnightlong Voter Adhikar Yatra last month, which was supported by all INDIA bloc constituents, including RJD and the Left.“The deal has almost been finalised and will be announced soon, as none of us wants to spoil the momentum created by the yatra. But the announcement can happen only after Monday,” a top RJD source said. Former Bihar Congress president Akhilesh Prasad Singh said, “The seat allocation is almost done, but at the last moment, some difficulties arise in all parties. These are there in the NDA as well and here too. Everything will be announced in 1-2 days. ”The VIP has emerged as another challenge for RJD as it has been demanding a significant number of seats and insisting that party chief Mukesh Sahani be named as the deputy CM face. Sources said while RJD is willing to allocate some 15-18 seats to the VIP, it is not prepared to make any commitment on the deputy CM post. Sahani posted on X on Saturday, promising to form a “govt” in Bihar where each community will receive “justice and dignity,” without mentioning the Mahagathbandhan or INDIA bloc.He later posted another message asserting that the “Grand Alliance is united” and stating, “We will write a new story of development and equality in Bihar along with the ideology of social justice of the respected Lalu Prasad.” Meanwhile, in a curious twist, Tejashwi held a meeting with All India Pan Mahasangh president I P Gupta on Saturday evening. The Pan community holds a significant vote share in Bihar and analysts say the move could be intended at countering the aggressive approach of Sahani.The delay in seat-sharing is causing frustration among the alliance partners, as only five days remain before the close of nominations for the first phase of elections to be held on November 6. The last date for filing nomination papers is October 17.","Rjd chief lalu prasad and his son tejashwi yadav reach new delhi in connection with a case of alleged irregularities in the award of irctc contracts.
