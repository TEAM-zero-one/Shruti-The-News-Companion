However, he could get the sale deed registered only in 2020 after he approached HC, as the area is covered under Gujarat Prohibition of Transfer of Immovable Property and Provisions of Tenants from Eviction from Premises in Disturbed Areas Act, 1991. The Act restricts property transactions in designated areas and mandates the district collector's permission for transactions.Dholkawala continued to face opposition in the neighbourhood as some of the residents challenged the sale to a Muslim and demanded its cancellation. The residents contended that allowing a Muslim to buy property in the area could lead to polarisation and disturb demographic equilibrium.In Feb 2023, HC rejected their petition and imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on each of the two litigants hounding the owner and ""thwarting his attempt to enjoy the fruits of the property which he successfully purchased"". An appeal against this order was also dismissed.However, the locals still did not allow Dholkawala to use the shop. They allegedly dumped debris at its gate so that it could not be opened. Dholkawala approached high court once again, seeking police protection so that he could get the shop repaired and conduct business from the premises.Dholkawala complained that he had approached police multiple times requesting protection, but received no support.","Onali dholkawala had legally purchased the shop from two hindu brothers in 2016.

CHENNAI/ BENGALURU: An IndiGo flight from Guwahati to Chennai with 168 passengers on board made an emergency landing at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) in Bengaluru on Thursday night after the captain gave a ‘Mayday’ (distress) call due to insufficient fuel.The pilot of IndiGo flight 6E-6764 (A321), which took off from Guwahati at 4.40pm, attempted to land at Chennai around 7.45pm, but decided to ‘go around’ after the landing gear touched the runway in a procedure called ‘balked landing’. “About 35 miles from Bengaluru airport, the captain made a ‘Mayday’ call,” said a source familiar with the development.The source said it appeared to be an ‘unstabilised approach’. “The sudden and steep climb had many passengers on the edge of their seats, some visibly frightened,” said a passenger who did not wish to be named.Multiple sources at the airport and ATC confirmed that the pilot did not attempt a second approach, he instead decided to fly to Bengaluru.Sources in KIA said: “After getting the distress call, the ATC alerted the on-ground staff members who swung into action. Medical and fire services personnel were in place. The aircraft landed safely at 8.20pm.”A source said both the pilots have been taken off the roster, but IndiGo refused to confirm the information.The airline said the flight was diverted to Bengaluru because of traffic congestion at Chennai airport – a claim that Chennai ATC disputed.“It appears that the plane, after the ‘go around’, did not have the mandatory minimum diversion fuel’,” said a source. IndiGo refused to confirm if the pilot made the ‘Mayday’ call.After landing at Bengaluru at 8.20pm, the crew announced that the flight would leave for Chennai after refuelling.

NEW DELHI: In a shocking incident, a woman's body was discovered buried in front of her residence, allegedly killed by her in-laws who concealed the crime for nearly two months by filing a missing person report. The victim, Tannu Kumar from Shikohabad in Firozabad district, Uttar Pradesh , was married to Arun Singh from Roshan Nagar two years ago.The victim's father, Hakim, claimed that despite his suspicions about a freshly covered pit observed during his visit to his brother-in-law's residence, the police initially dismissed his concerns.Four family members have been charged at Palla Police Station: Bhoop Singh (from UP's Mainpuri), his wife Sonia, son Arun Singh, and daughter Kajal. Sources indicate that Bhoop Singh and Arun Singh are currently under police interrogation.Police investigations reveal that on April 23, Arun Singh and his father arranged for an earthmover to dig a 10-foot deep pit outside their house. The following day, they had a mason fill it. Subsequently, they reported Tannu as missing, describing her as mentally challenged.Hakim stated that his daughter endured dowry-related harassment, forcing her to stay at her parents' home for a year post-marriage.Despite a panchayat's intervention facilitating her return to Faridabad, the issues persisted.Upon learning of his daughter's disappearance, Hakim visited Bhoop Singh's residence with his other daughter, Preeti, where he noticed the suspicious pit. Despite multiple visits to the local police station, his pleas for investigation were ignored until recently.The authorities excavated the pit on Friday morning in the presence of Naib Tehsildar Jaswant Singh, recovering Tannu's remains. A Faridabad Police spokesperson confirmed ongoing raids to apprehend the remaining family members. Following a post-mortem at Badshah Khan Civil Hospital, the body was released to the family.","Arun murdered his wife tannu and buried her body outside his house in faridabad.

NEW DELHI: The central government's plan to divert surplus water from the three western rivers of the Indus system in Jammu and Kashmir to Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan has sparked a sharp war of words among leaders of the northern states.Speaking of the 113 km-long canal proposed for redirecting surplus water to lower riparian states, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah objected to water diversion to Punjab and said he would ""never permit"" the allocation.""I will never permit this.

The couple had married in 2024, and he had flown ahead to set up their new home in London.""I should have been with her,"" the guilt-ridden man has been telling himself repeatedly, too traumatised to come to terms with the loss. During their last conversation, his wife had told him repeatedly not to get delayed and keep her waiting at London's Gatwick airport. ""So, when he received news of the crash, he took the first available flight and reached Ahmedabad, rebuking himself for getting late. He visited the (hospital) campus for three days to complete procedures and take home her remains for last rites. He did not cry, could not cry rather, even once,"" said a counsellor at Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad.Hospital authorities have appointed 10 counsellors - primarily experienced psychiatrists - to help families cope with the deaths of loved ones.Urvika Parekh, one of the counsellors, recounted breaking the news to a seven-year-old girl. ""She had come to give DNA samples for identification of remains. The family could not break the news to her. Some families have lost multiple family members. The void is hard to fill,"" Parekh said.The counsellors have encountered several instances of families unable to return to normal lives. A senior citizen who lost four family members has not gone back home. ""The emptiness of the house is too overwhelming for him, so he has been staying with a close relative for the time being. The same is true for several families as they have just held the last rites of their dear ones and are now finding it difficult to envision life without them,"" she said.Parekh explained the seven stages of grief - shock and denial, pain and guilt, anger and bargaining, depression, the upward turn, reconstruction, and acceptance.Disha Vasavada, another psychiatrist and counsellor said, ""It is tougher to cope with the loss of a child than a parent. In many instances, it may take days or weeks to process the trauma."" The counsellors will stay in touch with families. ""Some relatives gained composure initially but could not hold themselves back when the coffins were handed over. The first few days were spent making arrangements, but when reality sets in, hand-holding is necessary,"" she said.The psychiatrists drew parallels with early Covid deaths, where relatives were not allowed to see the deceased one last time, causing dissonance for those seeking closure.","A 27-year-old man lost his wife and has been unable to cry even once.

90% of kids rescued last year were from child labour: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/90-of-kids-rescued-last-year-were-from-child-labour-report/articleshow/122014262.cms,"NEW DELHI: Nearly 90% of the 44,902 children freed from the clutches of exploitation in over 27,000 operations between April 2024 and March this year were rescued from child labour, according to a report. The children were rescued by a collective of voluntary organisations in collaboration with authorities.The highest number of rescue operations (23,530) were related to child labour, followed by cases of sexual exploitation (2,766), and begging (1,092). Telangana reported the highest number of child labour rescues (11,063), followed by Bihar (3,974), Rajasthan (3,847), Uttar Pradesh (3,804), and Delhi (2,588). As many as 2,971 children were rescued from sexual exploitation, with West Bengal standing out at the top with 1,005 rescues followed by Bihar (454), Odisha (232), Maharashtra (194) and Rajasthan (191).The report, prepared by voluntary organisation India Child Protection, has drawn from data gathered by Just Rights for Children, a civil society network of over 250 organisations in across 26 states and UTs working in coordination with law enforcement agencies to combat child labour and trafficking as an organised economic crime.Focusing on how prosecution acts as a tipping point to end child labour, the report highlighted that legal action taken in 27,320 operations, showed that in majority of cases that is 35% (9,595) FIRs were registered - seen as a the most critical step in ensuring that those who are exploiting are prosecuted. In another 25% (6,959) cases were filed as General Diary entries, which are initial police records.In addition, around 23% of legal actions involved orders from child welfare committees (CWCs) or were filed under Form 17 of Juvenile Justice Rules, both of which focus on immediate care, protection and rehabilitation of rescued children. In 14% cases, challans were issued by labour departments, mainly in cases of child labour, serving as administrative penalties. The report said a very small proportion (less than 1%) were orders from district magistrates or sub-divisional magistrates, and only about 2% of cases had no clear legal action recorded.Just Rights for Children national convener Ravi Kant said despite gaps, prosecution action, crucial in creating strong deterrent against trafficking and child labour, is getting stronger in India.The report also highlighted that 5,809 employers and traffickers were arrested as part of these rescue operations and 85% of these were in child labour-related cases. Telangana, Bihar and Rajasthan reported the highest arrests, while states like UP and MP had fewer arrests despite high rescue numbers - highlighting enforcement gaps. The report also draws attention to missing children data, citing that is not uncommon for children classified as missing to be subsequently rescued from exploitative labour situations.Nearly 11,409 missing children were identified by the civil society network in 11,068 FIRs over 2024-25. Of them, 8,749 children were reported to be traced by March-end this year. States such as West Bengal (3,509), Maharashtra (1,149), and Bihar (1,306) reported the highest rescues of missing children, pointing to active coordination with child tracking systems.","Nearly 90% of the 44,902 children freed from the clutches of exploitation were rescued from child labour.
