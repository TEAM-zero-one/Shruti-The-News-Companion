High Court: Neighbour can’t be dragged into dowry case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/high-court-neighbour-cant-be-dragged-into-dowry-case/articleshow/126425510.cms,".

BENGALURU: Neighbours cannot be casually dragged into dowry harassment cases, Karnataka high court has held, quashing criminal proceedings against a Bengaluru woman caught in a matrimonial dispute between a couple in her neighbourhood.“A stranger cannot be drawn into the proceedings for offences under Section 498A of IPC, between the husband, wife or family members,” Justice M Nagaprasanna observed, granting relief to Asha G.The case arose from a complaint lodged on Feb 13, 2021, at Mahalakshmi Layout police station, in which Munirathnamma accused her husband, Muthuram, his family and neighbour Asha of cruelty and harassment. Police registered a case under IPC sections 498A, 504, 506 and 323 and later filed a chargesheet naming Asha as accused no. 5, alleging she had instigated Munirathnamma’s husband to torture her.Challenging the proceedings, Asha contended that she had no role whatsoever in the matrimonial life of the complainant and she was “only a neighbour”. She argued that the lone allegation of instigation was insufficient to rope her into a dowry harassment case, and that she had been arraigned as an accused because of an “axe to grind”.Munirathnamma maintained that Asha was the “reason” for her husband’s behaviour and should therefore face trial.However, Justice Nagaprasanna noted that the petitioner’s name surfaced “nowhere except for the contention that she instigated the husband to torture the wife”. The court held Asha did not fall within the definition of “family” as contemplated under Section 498A.","The case arose from a complaint lodged on feb 13, 2021, at mahalakshmi layout police station.

Rs 2k crore scam during Covid in Rajasthan noon meal scheme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-2k-crore-scam-during-covid-in-rajasthan-noon-meal-scheme/articleshow/126425449.cms,".

JAIPUR: Rajasthan’s anticorruption bureau (ACB) Thursday registered a case in an alleged Rs 2,000-crore scam linked to state govt’s midday meal scheme during the Covid-19 pandemic.ACB officers said the FIR names 21 accused, including officials of Rajasthan State Cooperative Consumer Federation Ltd (Confed), representatives of private firms and suppliers, who have been booked on charges of criminal conspiracy, forgery and misuse of govt funds.According to ACB, when schools were closed during the pandemic, a decision was taken that packs containing pulses, oil, spices and other essentials would be supplied through Confed under the midday meal scheme. The material was to be supplied in accordance with FSSAI and Agmark standards, with doorstep delivery to students across the state.Following complaints of large-scale irregularities in 2020-21, ACB registered a preliminary inquiry. Officers said it revealed officials conspired to rig the tender process by tweaking the eligibility norms. As a result, qualified firms were kept out of the bidding process, ensuring contracts were cornered by favoured companies.These firms allegedly further sublet the work to shell entities, creating a fake supply chain of non-existent suppliers and transporters, with little or no actual procurement or delivery.The investigation also found that in several cases, fake bills were generated and submitted without any actual purchase or supply, and govt payments obtained on the basis of bogus and inflated invoicing. In many cases, it is suspected substandard materials were supplied, but falsely certified as meeting prescribed quality and safety norms.A financial loss of about Rs 2,000 crore was estimated to have been caused to the state exchequer, ACB said. Based on the findings, an FIR was registered against Confed officials, central warehouse staff, private individuals and firms involved.","Rajasthan's anticorruption bureau (acb) thursday registered a case in an alleged rs 2,000-crore scam linked to state govt’s midday meal scheme during the covid-19 pandemic.

DU bids adieu to wall of democracy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/du-bids-adieu-to-wall-of-democracy/articleshow/126424902.cms,".

NEW DELHI: 'Bol ke lab azaad hain tere,' scribbled across a yellow chart paper, fought for space alongside a poster exhorting freshers to join the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad. During the high-decibel Delhi University Students' Union (DUSU) polls in Sept, the walls of democracy at North Campus gave opposing student parties the opportunity to stand neck-and-neck-at least on paper-and more.On Wednesday evening, however, when two women students affiliated with the Students' Federation of India (SFI) attempted to paste posters opposing the Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhishthan Bill near St. Stephen's College, they were shocked to learn that the walls no longer 'existed'.A video shows at least seven security staff stopping the duo.Only five months ago, Delhi University (DU) had notified guidelines against defacement of walls, especially during the student election season. It also asked departments and colleges to increase the size of these walls of democracy as much as possible at two notified locations.DU's North and South Campuses have several such walls, typically marked with a university-installed board reading 'Wall of Democracy' for easy identification.Walls adjacent to St. Stephen's College, near the Faculty of Arts, and opposite Daulat Ram College were among those officially designated.During student elections, anti-defacement committees were set up to ensure that posters were pasted only on these walls. Outside election periods, students have also used them to display posters related to protests, meetings and political or social issues.In a social media post, the student body alleged that the guards tore down the posters and verbally informed them of the university's decision. Students also claimed that the boards identifying these walls were removed without prior notice.DU proctor Manoj Kumar on Thursday confirmed that the walls had been denotified. He, however, did not provide any reason for the decision or indicate whether it had been communicated to students. He also did not clarify whether colleges had been asked to follow suit. A college principal said no one had asked them to follow in the university's footsteps, so far.The organisation submitted a complaint to the proctor's office on Thursday, demanding the immediate reinstatement of the walls.In its complaint, the SFI said the removal was carried out without any consultation with students or student organisations. It added that the walls have historically served as an important democratic space for students to express opinions and engage in political and social dialogue within the university.Calling the move an attempt to stifle democratic expression, students said the shrinking of such spaces undermines the democratic character of DU.","Du's north and south campuses have several such walls, typically marked with a university-installed board reading 'wall of democracy' for easy identification.

Deepam row: Piyush Goyal Accuses MK Stalin Govt Of Targeting Hindu Traditions

NEW DELHI: Pushing for expansion of NDA in Tamil Nadu, BJP is crafting a high-pitched campaign to position the alliance as a natural choice for anti-DMK voters amid emergence of actor Vijay-led TVK as the third force in the state's traditionally bipolar politics.AIADMK leader Edappadi K Palaniswami's meeting with home minister Amit Shah, a keen votary of widening the NDA tent in the poll-bound state, on Wednesday covered a range of issues related to the alliance's growth and agenda.That the PMK faction led by Anbumani Ramadoss was welcomed into NDA by EPS, as Palaniswami is commonly known, in Chennai hours before he met Shah in Delhi was as much about timing as about consolidating the alliance.However, EPS, the declared leader of NDA, has drawn a red line on including O Panneerselvam and Sasikala back into AIADMK or the alliance. In comments to media on Thursday, he reiterated his stand against them but offered no direct answer on TTV Dhinakaran, another former AIADMK functionary being spoken of as a prospective NDA member.BJP has long been of the view that the return of those once associated with AIADMK and its late leader J Jayalalithaa will send out a message of unity after the reverses it has suffered in elections.However, people familiar with the issue said BJP will ultimately go with EPS as it has already named him as leader of the alliance and believes an AIADMK-led front remains the best bet to defeat the DMK-Congress-Left combine.What has thrown up an imponderable in the poll equation is the emergence of TVK, which has gained in attraction for local satraps disaffected with their parent party or drawn by higher profiles on offer.With AIADMK under EPS ceding some space over the years, some functionaries have crossed over to TVK amid buzz that Panneerselvam and Dhinakaran may also move to the new outfit.A BJP functionary likened the attention and crowds Vijay is drawing to the buzz poll strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor had generated in Bihar, before his party came a cropper in the polls.Sources added that BJP would like to bring together all political forces, including TVK, opposed to the DMK-led front, but Vijay's projection of himself as the CM candidate and criticism of BJP's ideology have made such a prospect improbable. In fact, TVK has called Congress a natural ally amid a section of the national party openly indicating their unhappiness with DMK's refusal to share power and warm up to TVK.With issues far from settled in the state's governing alliance, NDA is planning to tie up the loose ends and shape the poll agenda by building a high-octane campaign around alleged corruption and misgovernance.",Bjp is pushing for expansion of nda in tamil nadu.

Key symptoms of lung cancer you must pay attention to

NEW DELHI: India's lung cancer burden is projected to rise sharply by 2030, with the North-East emerging as the worst-affected region and women recording the fastest increase in cases, a national study published in Indian Journal of Medical Research has found.Data from 57 populations across six regions show lung cancer incidence to be highest in the North-East, where rates for women are now close to those for men - an unusual pattern in India. Aizawl recorded the highest burden, with age-standardised incidence at 35.9 per lakh among men and 33.7 per lakh among women, along with the highest mortality.Although extremely high tobacco use - over 68% among men and 54% among women - continues to drive the region's burden, doctors say the disease profile is shifting. ""We are seeing more lung cancer cases among non-smoking women, linked to indoor air pollution, biomass fuel use, second-hand smoke and occupational exposure,"" said Dr Saurabh Mittal of AIIMS's pulmonology department.The shift is also reflected in tumour patterns nationwide. Adenocarcinoma has replaced smoking-linked squamous-cell carcinoma as the dominant subtype. In Bengaluru, it now accounts for over half of lung cancer cases among women, while Delhi has seen a sharp rise in large-cell carcinoma.Southern districts such as Kannur, Kasargod and Kollam reported high incidence among men despite relatively low tobacco and alcohol use, pointing to non-tobacco risk factors. Among women, Hyderabad and Bengaluru recorded the highest incidence in the south. In the north, Srinagar showed elevated lung cancer rates among men, while women in Srinagar and Pulwama also reported higher incidence despite low substance use.Trend analysis shows lung cancer incidence climbing by up to 6.7% annually among women and 4.3% among men in some regions. Thiruvananthapuram recorded the sharpest rise among women, while Dindigul saw the steepest increase among men. With tobacco use among women still below 10% nationwide, researchers point to worsening air quality and household exposures as key drivers.Projections suggest that by 2030, lung cancer incidence among men could exceed 33 per lakh in parts of Kerala, while among women it could rise to over 8 per lakh in cities like Bengaluru. Low mortality-to-incidence ratios in several regions also point to gaps in death reporting, potentially masking the true toll.",India's lung cancer burden is projected to rise sharply by 2030.

Rs 58 crore digital arrest fraudsters opened 10k mule accounts: Cops,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-58-crore-digital-arrest-fraudsters-opened-10k-mule-accounts-cops/articleshow/126421857.cms,".

MUMBAI: The Maharashtra Nodal Cyber Police on Wednesday filed a 2,500-page chargesheet in a Rs 58-crore 'digital arrest' con naming 32 arrested persons and 41 wanted accused, who not only impersonated Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) officers, but also created a multi-layered web of mule bank accounts to move money across states and eventually overseas.According to the chargesheet, the investigation uncovered over 10,000 mule accounts, many opened in the names of fictitious companies using forged KYC documents and fake SIM cards. The funds allegedly travelled through 13 layers of accounts, including at least 27 active mule accounts in Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan, before being diverted abroad. The masterminds are suspected to be operating from Cambodia and Dubai, with one Vijay Khanna emerging as a key handler believed to be outside India.The fraud began in Aug 2025, when a pharmaceutical businessman and his wife were allegedly terrorised through calls and video interactions by persons posing as CBI and ED officials. The couple was told that their bank accounts had received ""suspicious"" funds attracting money-laundering provisions and were shown fake video calls and staged clips depicting police stations, CBI and ED offices, and even mock courtrooms with actors posing as judges, officers, and lawyers.Under the guise of investigation, the couple was coerced to transfer their entire savings of over Rs 58.1 crore, with assurances the money would be returned after clearance.Investigators said arrested Gujarat businessman Jayeshbhai Dapa's firm, Jai Bhavani Mechanical, allegedly received nearly Rs 15.3 crore, which was then routed to multiple accounts for monetary consideration. Accounts in the names of Meghdoot Trading, owned by Sakalkumar Sahu, Jacky Explorer owned by Chirag Sharma, and entities such as SBV Foundation and M-Stak Innovation allegedly received major sums, ranging from Rs 1.9 crore to Rs 2.4 crore.Devendranath Raut, a resident of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, allegedly received Rs 2.1 crore in the name of Sainath Enterprises and stated, during interrogation, that he transferred funds at the behest of a wanted accused, Shratik. Investigators have also tracked Rs 3.4 crore allegedly transferred to accounts linked with wanted accused Vijay Gaikwad, Abhijit Jamble, and Ratnadeep.The chargesheet alleged that AVB Foundation, owned by Akshay Meena of Bhilwara, received Rs 30 lakh, while Maybank Indonesia accounts linked to Technomist Softwares and Arkit Solutions and opened by Devendra alias Sunny and Mukesh Bhatia received Rs 50 lakh. Accused Katunga Raju Samuel Prasad from Andhra Pradesh allegedly received Rs 2.4 crore through an account in the name of a religious trust.","The maharashtra nodal cyber police filed a 2,500-page chargesheet in a rs 58-crore 'digital arrest' con naming 32 arrested persons and 41 wanted accused.

JAMMU: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Thursday assured that the first batch of 50 students selected for admission to Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence (SMVDIME) in Reasi would not be allowed to suffer because of NMC’s withdrawal of permission to run the MBBS course. The government would accommodate the students in other institutions through supernumerary seats, he said.“We will adjust them by creating supernumerary seats in colleges close to their homes so that their education does not suffer,” the CM told media persons on the sidelines of a function in Jammu. It was the govt’s responsibility to accommodate the students, he said, adding that this was not a difficult task and had been “discussed thoroughly”.Supernumerary seats are additional seats created over and above the approved intake in an educational institute.Omar has been critical of the agitation spearheaded by Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Sangharsh Samiti against 42 Muslim students, mostly from Kashmir, being granted admission to the Jammu-based medical institute funded by Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board, as against only seven Hindus. He reiterated that the students got admission on merit as the selections were based on NEET scores.The NMC order on withdrawal of permission cited SMVDIME’s non-adherence to minimum standards as the reason. In a reference to that, Omar said accountability must be fixed if standards were not maintained at the medical institute. “We will accommodate these 50 students, but someone must answer for the damage done to students’ futures,” he said.Responding to questions on inspections by NMC and the medical college’s non-compliance with norms, he said: “You should question the university and its office-bearers from top to bottom — why, after building a medical college, did it fail to pass inspection?”The CM also interacted with the J&K Under-16 cricket team that clinched the Vijay Merchant Trophy (Plate Group) for the first time. Congratulating the team on their remarkable feat, he said, “Your victory reflects not just talent, but teamwork, discipline and dedication. You have made the entire J&K proud.”Omar presented an appreciation trophy to the victorious team, led by Smagey Khajuria. J&K defeated Mizoram by an innings and 182 runs to lift the trophy in Surat on Jan 6.","Omar has been critical of the agitation spearheaded by shri mata vaishno devi sangharsh samiti against 42 muslim students, mostly from kashmir, being granted admission to the jammu-based medical institute.

Sources said TMC has raised concerns over alleged access to party's confidential material linked to special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, including information on booth-level agents, and documents connected to preparations for the 2026 Bengal polls.ED searched Jain's home on Loudon Street near central Kolkata's Park Street and I-PAC's office in Sector V, the city's IT hub in Salt Lake on the eastern fringe. The searches were linked to an alleged coal scam. Tension flared outside Jain's home when central forces accompanying ED allegedly asked personnel from Shakespeare Sarani police station - which covers the Park Street area - to remain outside the main gate. A verbal confrontation followed.Shakespeare Sarani police is preparing to register a suo motu case against ED and CRPF, alleging obstruction of police work.Jain's family is also considering a separate complaint, alleging family members were forcibly detained and that ED entered private areas without notice.Another suo motu case is being considered by Electronic Complex police station, which has jurisdiction over Sector V, alleging ED did not inform local police before the operation at I-PAC's office. ED has criticised Kolkata police for what it described as ""overactivity"".The court battle unfolds against the backdrop of TMC's long-running and electorally successful association with I-PAC that began in 2019. Over the next six-and-a-half years, TMC recorded a 100% strike rate with I-PAC on board, sweeping the 2021 assembly elections, winning the 2023 panchayat polls and retaining dominance in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in Bengal.After the 2021 assembly polls, Kishor exited to pursue his own political plans, but I-PAC stayed on.",Tmc and i-pac move calcutta high court over ed searches at pratik jain's residence and group's office.

"Medical college row: Omar says Jammu’s loss, blames protesters for ‘destroying’ students’ future; BJP & Hindu groups celebrate",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/medical-college-row-omar-says-jammus-loss-blames-protesters-for-destroying-students-future-bjp-hindu-groups-celebrate/articleshow/126401866.cms,"SRINAGAR: BJP and Hindu groups on Wednesday celebrated the National Medical Commission’s decision to withdraw permission to Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence (SMVDIME) in Reasi, Jammu, to run an MBBS course from 2025-26 academic session, while J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah reacted sharply, accusing them of playing with the future of students.As activists of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Sangharsh Samiti — a conglomerate of Hindu social and religious organisations that led an agitation against the admission of non-Hindu students to the shrine board-run medical college — held victory marches in Jammu, burst crackers and danced, Omar on Wednesday evening said it was unfortunate that people were celebrating the “closure of a medical college”. “In other parts of the country people fight to get such institutions,” he said. “If you are happy to destroy the future of our children, then go ahead and burst crackers.”The Sangharsh Samiti had been protesting since Nov against the admission of 42 Muslim students, mostly from Kashmir, in the first batch of 50, with only seven Hindus and one Sikh among the selected candidates. Its contention was that an institution funded by Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board should give preference to Hindu students and those who have faith in Mata Vaishno Devi.CM Omar said within two years, the institute’s intake capacity would have risen to 400, of which about 250 would have come from Jammu. “Now, no one will get those seats because the college has been closed in the name of religion,” he said. Students who fail to secure admission in medical colleges in future should remember the role played by the Sangharsh Samiti in closing this institute, he added.On Tuesday, barely an hour before the NMC order, the CM had said the medical college was not worth running given the religious politics played around it, and had suggested shutting it down. “In the given scenario, I don’t feel the students themselves would like to study there. We request GoI and the health ministry to adjust these children in other colleges. Had I been a parent of these students, I wouldn’t send them there,” Omar had said.Although NMC stated that the Letter of Permission was being withdrawn as an inspection found non-compliance with minimum standards, the Sangharsh Samiti claimed it was a result of its prolonged agitation. “This is our first major victory,” its representatives said at a news briefing, adding, “Our current protest has ended but there are more issues, like the Shrine Board Act which needs amendment.”BJP’s J&K president and Rajya Sabha member Sat Sharma, too, welcomed the NMC decision, and thanked LG Manoj Sinha and Union health minister J P Nadda, for withdrawal of permission while safeguarding the interests of selected students.Kashmir-based parties, however, slammed the decision, terming it Jammu’s loss, and blamed BJP. NC minister Javed Rana said admissions in educational institutions shouldn’t be sought on the basis of religion. He accused BJP of “communalising” the issue of admissions in SMVDIME.PDP called it “a ruthless setback” for Jammu region, and blamed BJP. “People of Jammu must wake up to the reality that religious polarisation only sabotages their future. This entire episode was cynically engineered by BJP for narrow political gains in the name of religion, and it is Jammu that has been made to pay the price,” PDP youth wing president Aditya Gupta said.","National medical commission withdraws permission to shri mata vaishno devi institute of medical excellence (smvdime) in reasi, jammu.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday accused the Centre of holding political vendetta, alleging that central agencies were being misused ahead of elections, after the Enforcement Directorate carried out searches at various locations, including the residence of IPAC chief Pratik Jain.Reacting sharply to the action, Banerjee questioned the role of the ED and Union home minister Amit Shah . She claimed that party documents and data were being seized under the pretext of investigations. She also alleged that voter names were being deleted in West Bengal during the ongoing Special Intensive Revision exercise, linking the moves to the election process.""..Is it the duty of the ED, Amit Shah to collect the party's hard disk, candidate list?...

Leader of the Opposition in the West Bengal Assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, termed Banerjee’s visit to the residence of I-PAC chief Pratik Jain during an ED raid as “unconstitutional” and “direct interference” in the investigation.Adhikari said the Enforcement Directorate should take action against the chief minister, alleging that her presence, along with that of the Kolkata police commissioner, was unethical and improper while the search was underway at Jain’s Loudon Street residence.He also pointed out that I-PAC manages the IT cell of the Trinamool Congress and drew parallels with a previous incident, claiming that Banerjee had similarly visited the then Kolkata police commissioner Rajeev Kumar’s official residence during a CBI raid.This comes after the Enforcement Directorate conducted raid at houses of IT chiefs of various political parties including TMC's IPAC chief Prateek Jain. The raids were carried out at 15 location in connection with a fake government job scam allegedly run by an organised gang that duped people by promising jobs, officials said.","West bengal chief minister mamata banerjee accused the centre of holding political vendetta.

Karnataka Bus Tragedy: More Than 20 Killed As Sleeper Coach Turns Into Fireball After Crash On NH-48

NEW DELHI: Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Thursday said he has asked state governments to investigate ""corruption"", irregularities and flouting of norms by sleeper bus body builders and authorities registering such vehicles and issuing fitness certificates.Talking about fire incidents in sleeper buses that have claimed 145 lives in three months, including in Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, Gadkari said he has asked the states concerned to take exemplary action against those responsible.He also said that govt is working to introduce a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technology using free spectrum, beginning with cars, to prevent road accidents. Under the V2V technology, drivers would be alerted about speed, location, acceleration, vehicles in blind spots and braking of other vehicles in real-time in their vicinity. This will allow drivers to take preventive action.Flagging the issue of bus fires, Gadkari said, ""We have found that there was no compliance of norms in building sleeper buses. It has also come to our notice that there was corruption at different levels. People have pasted logos of reputed brands fraudulently. I have gone through the presentations on such bus fire accidents. In six incidents, we lost 145 lives. I have written to Rajasthan and other state govts to investigate the irregularities and take strict action against those responsible.He said govt has decided that sleeper coach buses will only be manufactured by automobile companies or facilities accredited by the Centre. Existing sleeper coach buses will have to be retrofitted with fire detection systems, emergency exits with hammers, emergency lighting, and driver drowsiness indicators, Gadkari added.Separately, road transport secretary V Umashankar has written to chief secretaries to address the problem and fix responsibilities as well. Gadkari and Umashankar were addressing reporters after a two-day meet on transport and road safety related issues with states. tnn","Road transport minister nitin gadkari has asked state governments to investigate ""corruption"", irregularities and flouting of norms by sleeper bus body builders.

NEW DELHI: Enforcement Directorate on Thursday accused West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee of obstructing an ongoing money-laundering investigation, claiming that search operations were conducted “in a peaceful and professional manner till the arrival of the Bengal CM” along with senior state police officials.In a statement, the ED said it was carrying out searches at 10 premises, six in West Bengal and four in Delhi under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in connection with an alleged coal smuggling syndicate led by Anup Majee.The ED alleged that proceedings were disrupted after Banerjee arrived at the residence of Pratik Jain, the I-PAC chief, accompanied by a large number of police personnel. “Mamata Banerjee entered the residential premises of Prateek Jain and took away key evidences including physical documents and electronic devices,” the agency said. It further claimed that the chief minister’s convoy then moved to I-PAC’s office, from where “Banerjee, her aides, and state police personnel forcibly removed physical documents and electronic evidences”.The agency said the investigation had uncovered links between the coal smuggling network and hawala operators, with proceeds of crime running into tens of crores of rupees. One such hawala operator, the ED claimed, had facilitated transactions to Indrapac Consulting Private Limited (I-PAC), a political consultancy firm associated with the Trinamool Congress.According to the ED, these actions resulted in obstruction of an ongoing investigation. The agency insisted that the searches were evidence-based, not targeted at any political establishment, and unrelated to elections. “No party office has been searched,” it said, adding that the operation was part of a routine crackdown on money laundering and conducted strictly in accordance with legal safeguards.Earlier, Banerjee rejected the allegations and accused the central agency of attempting to seize the TMC’s internal documents and election strategy. Speaking to reporters after visiting Jain’s residence and the I-PAC office in Salt Lake, she said ED officials were confiscating party documents, hard disks, laptops and mobile phones containing sensitive political data. “Is it the duty of the ED to collect political party data?” she asked, describing the searches as politically motivated and unconstitutional.Launching a sharp attack on the BJP leadership, Banerjee accused Union home minister Amit Shah of misusing central agencies to intimidate opposition parties. She alleged that the raid amounted to “political vendetta” and claimed the ED had begun searches early in the morning when no one was present at the office, allowing officials to access and copy election-related data.Speaking at a gatheringj later, the West Bengal CM said the truth would eventually prevail.""Truth will prevail; we will not interfere. But look at the BJP's conduct when we face them in a political manner,"" she said.Meanwhile, Trinamool Congress leader Kunal Ghosh led party workers and leaders in a protest in Kolkata.","The enforcement directorate on thursday accused west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee of obstructing an ongoing money-laundering investigation.

'Naughty, Nasty HM': Mamata Slams Amit Shah After ED Raids TMC Leader Amid SIR Row
