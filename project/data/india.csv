Bhagwat ji's tenure will be considered most transformative period in RSS' 100-year journey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bhagwat-jis-tenure-will-be-considered-most-transformative-period-in-rss-100-yr-journey/articleshow/123820021.cms,"RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat’s Big Statement: Hindu-Muslim Already One, Muslims Deserve Equal Job Rights

(The author is Prime Minister of India)

Today is Sept 11. This day evokes two contrasting remembrances. The first dates back to 1893, when Swami Vivekananda delivered his iconic Chicago address. With the few words, ""Sisters and Brothers of America,"" he won the hearts of thousands present in the hall. He introduced the timeless spiritual heritage of India and the emphasis on universal brotherhood to the world stage. The second is the gruesome 9/11 attacks, when this very principle came under attack thanks to the menace of terrorism and radicalism.There is something else about this day which is noteworthy. Today is the birthday of a personality who, inspired by the principle of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, has dedicated his entire life to societal transformation and strengthening the spirit of harmony and fraternity. For lakhs of people associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, he is respectfully referred to as Param Pujya Sarsanghchalak. Yes, I am referring to Shri Mohan Bhagwat ji, whose 75th birthday is, incidentally, falling in the same year when the RSS marks its centenary. I would like to convey my best wishes to him and pray for his long and healthy life.My association with Mohan ji's family has been very deep. I have had the good fortune of working closely with Mohan ji's father, the late Madhukarrao Bhagwat ji. I have written extensively about him in my book, Jyotipunj. Along with his association with the legal world, he devoted himself to nation-building. He played a pivotal role in strengthening the RSS across Gujarat. Such was Madhukarrao ji's passion towards nation-building that it groomed his son, Mohanrao, to work towards India's regeneration.It is as if Parasmani Madhukarrao prepared another Parasmani in Mohanrao.Mohan ji became a pracharak in the mid-1970s. Upon hearing the word 'pracharak', one may mistakenly think it refers to someone who is simply doing prachar or campaigning, propagating ideas. But, those familiar with the working of the RSS understand that the pracharak tradition is at the core of the organisation's work. Over the last hundred years, thousands of young people, inspired by a patriotic zeal, have left their homes and families to dedicate their lives to realising the mission of India First.His early years in the RSS coincided with a very dark period of Indian history. This was the time the draconian Emergency was imposed by the then Congress govt. For every person who cherished democratic principles and wanted India to prosper, it was natural to strengthen the anti-Emergency movement. This is exactly what Mohan ji and countless RSS swayamsevaks did. He worked extensively in rural and backward areas of Maharashtra, especially Vidarbha. This shaped his understanding of the challenges faced by the poor and downtrodden.Over the years, Bhagwat ji held various positions in the RSS. He performed each and every one of those duties with great dexterity. Mohan ji's years as the head of the Akhil Bharatiya Sharirik Pramukh during the 1990s are still fondly remembered by many swayamsevaks. During this period, he spent considerable time working in the villages of Bihar. These experiences further deepened his connect with grassroots issues. In 2000, he became the sarkaryawah and here too, he brought his unique way of working, handling the most complex of situations with ease and precision. In 2009, he became the sarsanghchalak and continues to work with great vibrancy.Being sarsanghchalak is more than an organisational responsibility. Extraordinary individuals have defined this role through personal sacrifice, clarity of purpose and unshakable commitment to Maa Bharti. Mohan ji, in addition to doing full justice to the enormity of the responsibility, has also brought to it his own strength, intellectual depth and empathetic leadership, all of which is inspired by the principle of Nation First.If I can think of two attributes Mohan ji has held close to his heart and imbibed in his work style, they are continuity and adaptation. He has always steered the Organisation through very complex currents, never compromising on the core ideology we are all proud of and at the same time addressing the evolving needs of society. He has a natural connect with the youth and thus, has always focused on integrating more youngsters with the Sangh Parivar. He is often seen engaging in public discourse and interacting with people, which has been very beneficial in today's dynamic and digital world.Broadly speaking, Bhagwat ji's tenure will be considered the most transformative period in the 100-year journey of the RSS. From the change in uniform to the modifications in the shiksha vargs (training camps), several significant changes occurred under his leadership.I particularly remember Mohan ji's efforts during the Covid period, when humanity battled a once in a lifetime pandemic. In those times, continuing the traditional RSS activities became challenging. Mohan ji suggested increased usage of technology. In the context of the global challenges, he remained connected with global perspectives while developing institutional frameworks.At that time, all swayamsevaks made every possible effort to reach out to those in need, while ensuring the safety of themselves and others. Medical camps were organised in several places. We also lost many of our hardworking swayamsevaks, but such was the inspiration of Mohan ji that their determination never wavered.Earlier this year, during the inauguration of the Madhav Netra Chikitsalaya in Nagpur, I had remarked that the RSS is like an Akshayavat, an eternal banyan tree that energises the national culture and collective consciousness of our nation.The roots of this Akshayavat are deep and strong because they are anchored in values. The dedication with which Mohan Bhagwat ji has committed himself to nurturing and advancing these values is truly inspirational.Another admirable quality of Mohan ji's personality is his soft-spoken nature. He is blessed with an exceptional ability to listen. This trait ensures a deeper perspective and also brings a sense of sensitivity and dignity to his persona and leadership.Here, I also want to write about the keen interest he has always shown towards various mass movements. From Swachh Bharat Mission to Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, he always urges the entire RSS family to add vigour through these movements. In order to further social well-being, Mohan ji has given the 'Panch Parivartan', which includes social harmony, family values, environmental awareness, national selfhood and civic duties. These can inspire Indians from all walks of life. Every swayamsevak dreams of seeing a strong and prosperous nation. To realise this dream, what is required is both clear vision and decisive action. Mohan ji embodies both these qualities in abundance.Bhagwat ji has always been a strong votary of 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat', a firm believer in India's diversity and the celebration of so many different cultures and traditions that are a part of our land.Beyond his busy schedule, Mohan ji has always found time to pursue passions like music and singing. Few people know that he is very versatile in various Indian musical instruments. His passion for reading can be seen in several of his speeches and interactions.This year, in a few days from now, the RSS turns 100. It is also a pleasant coincidence that this year, Vijaya Dashami , Gandhi Jayanti, Lal Bahadur Shastri Jayanti and the RSS centenary celebrations are on the same day. It will be a historic milestone for lakhs of people associated with the RSS in India and the world. And, we have a very wise and hardworking sarsanghchalak in Mohan ji, steering the organisation in these times. I will conclude by saying that Mohan ji is a living example of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, showing that when we rise above boundaries and consider everyone as our own, it strengthens trust, brotherhood and equality in society. I once again wish Mohan ji a long and healthy life in service of Maa Bharti.","Rss chief mohan bhagwat’s big statement: hindu-muslim already one, muslims deserve equal job rights. Prime minister of india: being sarsanghchalak is more than an organisational responsibility. Mohan ji's tenure will be considered the most transformative period in the 100-year journey of the rss.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123820066,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-41604,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

AAP claims

cross-voting happened on both sides

'Deserves a systematic and clinical investigation'

'Don't malign Maharashtra'

NEW DELHI: Did some INDIA bloc MPs cross-vote in the vice-presidential elections held on Tuesday? Well, the NDA is certain that they did. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Wednesday rubbed salt into opposition's wounds as he extended special thanks to the INDIA bloc MPs who voted with 'conscience'.""Special thanks to some MPs of- INDI Alliance who voted with 'Conscience' for NDA candidate CP Radhakrishnan in the VP election. NDA and All our friendly MPs remain united. Congratulations to everyone on electing a humble & efficient man and a true patriot as India's new Vice President,"" Rijiju posted on X taking a dig at the opposition.In fact, soon after the results for the VP elections were out yesterday, the BJP and the Congress sparred over ‘conscience vote’. This was triggered by the ""more-than-expected"" margin of victory of NDA's CP Radhakrishnan.Radhakrishnan was elected country’s 15th Vice-President with 452 votes - which was 14 more than the actual numerical strength of the NDA bloc. On the other hand, the INDIA bloc candidate, retired Supreme Court judge B. Sudershan Reddy, got 300 first preference votes. This was 15 less than what opposition leaders had claimed before the results were out.Adding to the suspense was the fact that 15 votes were declared invalid.Who was impacted more by the invalid votes - NDA or INDIA bloc - will remain a matter of conjecture, since this was a secret ballot. Also, possibly there would never be a confirmation of who cross-voted, and for whom, unless those who did it decide to identify themselves for any possible political gains. But the fact remains that NDA candidate CP Radhakrishnan got 14 extra votes. So, cross-voting did happen.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) general secretary BL Santhosh claimed that the INDIA bloc candidate received 15 fewer votes than their total number. ""Voting happened through ballot papers & INDI Alliance got 15 votes less than their number. The INDI alliance leaders had campaigned for conscience vote. They got it in return,"" Santhosh posted on X.And this reality of cross-voting has already brought to fore the deep division within the opposition ranks. Accusations flew - interestingly both among the allies and also within the parties - on who is to blame for this?The Trinamool Congress trained its guns at Arvind Kejriwal's AAP. TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee said, ""As I said, there are some parties, especially in the Rajya Sabha, where some people may have been elected from their party, but are still clearly aligned with the BJP. I gave you an example of a Rajya Sabha member of Aam Aadmi Party. There may be four or five such members ... You can buy those who have been elected, you can buy those who are in the opposition but you cannot buy the common people. ""Abhishek Banerjee also alleged that the saffron camp spent Rs 15-Rs 20 crore per MP to ""buy votes"" and accused it of using money power to undermine democracy. ""After speaking to a few people, I can say the BJP spent Rs 15-20 crore on each person to buy votes. People elected as representatives are selling the people's trust and emotions. Representatives can be bought, but not the people,"" the TMC leader claimed.The BJP hit back sharply to Abhishek Banerjee's claim. West Bengal BJP president and Rajya Sabha MP Shamik Bhattacharya dismissed Banerjee's allegations as ""baseless"" and said the results reflected Opposition disunity.""I do not wish to dignify his comments with a response. But this Vice-Presidential election has clearly shown that the NDA is united, while the opposition is in disarray,"" he said.AAP, however, added a new dimension to the debate as it claimed there was cross-voting on both sides. AAP also claimed that only one of its MPs had cross-voted. ""I can tell you with full responsibility that all our MPs, except one, have voted for the opposition party's vice-presidential candidate. According to our assessment, our estimate is that about twenty-seven opposition members of parliament have cross-voted and about twelve MPs from the BJP side have cross-voted, due to which there is a difference of fifteen,"" AAP Delhi president Saurabh Bharadwaj said.Meanwhile, there were ripples within parties also. Congress leader Manish Tewari demanded thorough probe into allegations of cross-voting. ""If there was cross-voting, then it should be seriously investigated by each of the constituents of the INDIA Alliance. Cross-voting is an extremely serious matter. If at all, what you are saying is correct or what is appearing in the public space or is being speculated has an iota of truth in it, it deserves a systematic and clinical investigation,"" Tewari told ANI.Congress MP Pramod Tiwari while refusing to comment on the probability of alleged cross-voting, said that parties in the opposition will have to review the same.Tiwari harped on the increased vote share of joint opposition candidate which was 40 per cent of the vote - 14 per cent more than the votes the opposition received last time.""I congratulate CP Radhakrishnan on his victory. As far as the results are concerned, the opposition got 26 per cent of the votes the last time. This time, it rose to 40 per cent. There is danger knocking at PM Modi's door. If cross-voting was made to happen, it is wrong. But I won't comment on it. There are several parties, and all of them will review it. Then I will make an official comment on it,"" Tiwari said.NCP(SP) leader and Baramati MP Supriya Sule reacted sharply to allegations of cross voting by MPs of Maharashtra and said the ruling coalition should not ""malign"" the state.""If 14 votes got split, did Maharashtra do it? Why are you maligning Maharashtra? Don't defame the Marathi people,"" said Sule.""Voting was secret, right? Then how did you know that cross-voting took place? BJP's Sanjay Jaiswal says there were 40 (extra) votes. Out of 40, some 11 were from YSR Congress, which is not part of the INDIA group. BJP's allies support them only as per their convenience,"" Sule said.Claims and counterclaims will continue. But the fact remains that the opposition which had hoped to surprise the BJP-led NDA in this conscience vote system - has been itself left surprised by the final outcome.(With inputs from agencies)",'rs 15-rs 20 crore per mp spent to buy votes' says tmc's abhishek banerjee.

NEW DELHI: A wildlife survey conducted in Arunachal Pradesh has brought out first-ever photographic evidence of the elusive Pallas’s cat in the state, reaffirming the eastern Himalayan terrain as a global biodiversity hotspot.The survey, conducted by WWF-India in association with the forest department of the Arunachal Pradesh government, also recorded the presence of other wild cats - snow leopard, common leopard, clouded leopard and marbled cat - above 4200 metres, indicating the landscape’s unique wild cat diversity.“The discovery of Pallas’s cat in Arunachal Pradesh at nearly 5,000 metres is a powerful reminder of how little we still know about life in the high Himalayas,” said Rishi Kumar Sharma, head-science and conservation, Himalayas programme, WWF-India.Pallas’s cat is one of the most elusive and rarely photographed wild cats, and remains one of the least studied feline species. Its documentation in Arunachal Pradesh extends the known distribution of the species in the eastern Himalaya, adding to earlier confirmed records from Sikkim, Bhutan, and eastern Nepal.Though WWF-India conducted the survey during July-Sept last year, its findings were released only recently.The organisation claimed to have deployed 136 camera traps in 83 locations across 2,000 sq km of rugged high-altitude rangelands in West Kameng and Tawang districts, making it one of the most extensive wildlife monitoring exercises.Besides getting photographic record of Pallas’s cat, the survey documented the highest elevation records for common leopard at 4,600 metres above sea level (masl), clouded leopard at 4,650 masl, marbled cat at 4,326 masl, Himalayan wood owl at 4,194 masl and grey-headed flying squirrel at 4,506 masl.WWF-India’s findings noted that the elevation records for these species were the “highest in India to dateand may exceed previously known global elevation limits”.“The discovery of Pallas’s cat in Arunachal Pradesh is a milestone for wildlife research in the eastern Himalayas. These findings reaffirm the state’s importance as a global biodiversity hotspot and highlight the need for continued investment in scientific monitoring and conservation,” said Ngilyang Tam, state’s principal chief conservator of forests and chief wildlife warden (wildlife and biodiversity).",First-ever photographic evidence of the elusive pallas’s cat in arunachal pradesh.

Rahul Gandhi vs Election Commission

NEW DELHI: The Madras high court dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking directions to the Election Commission of India (ECI) to clarify leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi ’s “vote chori” (vote theft) allegations, terming the plea “completely misconceived.”“The petition is vague, devoid of material particulars, lacks substantive evidence, and founded solely on political claims and counter-claims.

NEW DELHI: The North East will get its fourth Rajdhani train on Saturday with PM Narendra Modi flagging off the inaugural train between Aizawl and Delhi. At present, Rajdhani trains are operational from Delhi to Naharlagun (Arunachal Pradesh), Agartala (Tripura) and Dibrugarh (Assam).Railway ministry officials said the PM will inaugurate the Bairabi-Sairang railway line, vital to linking Aizawl to the rail network, and flag off two more train services — Aizawl-Kolkata and Aizawl-Guwahati — on Saturday. They added that Mizoram becomes the fourth Northeastern state whose capital will now be directly connected to the Indian Railways network.“The Bairabi–Sairang new line project spans 51.4 km, and it has been built with an investment of around Rs 8,071 crore. This corridor has 48 tunnels (total length of 12.8 km), 55 major bridges, 87 minor bridges, five road over bridges and another six under bridges. The tunnels are adorned with murals reflecting Mizo heritage, which will turn the trip into a cultural experience,” said an official. Construction of the line began in 2015.Once operational, the new line will reduce the travel time between Aizawl and Guwahati from 16 hours by road to 12 hours by train and between Aizawl and Silchar from nearly seven hours by road to just three hours.“The benefits of this rail link will be multidimensional. Besides making travel easier, it will lead to socio-economic development, boosting tourism and other trade sectors not only in Mizoram but across the other Northeastern states as well,” said an official.","The north east will get its fourth rajdhani train on saturday.

"Concept of ‘brain-dead’ unscientific, says petitioner: SC struggles to understand medical jargon, adjourns hearing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/concept-of-brain-dead-unscientific-says-petitioner-sc-struggles-to-understand-medical-jargon-adjourns-hearing/articleshow/123776993.cms,"Poll Should the Supreme Court have the authority to influence changes to laws regarding brain-death definitions? Yes, they should have that authority. No, it violates separation of powers.

NEW DELHI: Attuned to understand the legal jargons, a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Monday found it difficult to digest the medical terminology saturated arguments of a doctor who challenged the validity of the definition of brain-dead in the Transplantation of Organs and Tissues Act (THOTA), 1994.Appealing against a Kerala HC judgment, Dr S Ganapathy told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi that the concept of brain death and certification in India is unscientific and is violative of Article 21 of the Constitution. He said Sections 2(d) and 2(e) THOTA, relatable to brain death, are unconstitutional.Section 2(d) provided the meaning of ‘brain-stem-death’ as a stage when all functions of the brainstem have ceased permanently and irreversibly. Sec 2(e) provided that ‘deceased person’ means a person in whom permanent disappearance of all evidence of life occurs, by reason of brain-stem death or in a cardio-pulmonary sense, at any time after live birth has taken place.As he continued to explain brain-stem death, and its different meanings in different countries, Justice Kant-led bench said, “It is almost impossible for us to understand the medical terminologies you use. Why don’t you make a presentation on this before the National Medical Commission or experts from the health ministry?”“Ultimately, even if the court or the authorities accept your definition of bran-death, ultimately it would require the government to move a Bill in Parliament to amend the law.Can SC direct Parliament to amend a law? Will it not violate the Constitution-mandated separation of power,” the bench asked.Dr Ganapathy said organ transplant is the biggest business in India and only the poor patients are declared brain-dead to enable harvesting of the organs for other rich patients. “Why is it that hospitals declare only poor patients as brain-dead and not the kin of a SC judge, advocate or a rich and influential person,” he asked.The bench said, “If Parliament chose a definition of brain-death, the courts must accept it. We will not be able to change it even as the Supreme Court. You may argue that the brain-death definition given in the law is incomplete, but it is not an incorrect one.”When the court was about to dispose of the appeal, Dr Ganapathy said his earlier petition, challenging another order of the Kerala HC asking him to approach appropriate authority regarding malpractice in hospitals in declaring a person brain-dead, is pending since 2018 and requested that the present appeal be tagged with that one. SC gladly agreed to escape the medical jargon.","Dr s ganapathy told a bench of justices surya kant and joymalya bagchi that the concept of brain death and certification in india is unscientific. “why is it that hospitals declare only poor patients as brain-dead and not the kin of a sc judge, advocate or a rich and influential person,” he asked.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123777021,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-960185,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

All this crying and weeping that is going on, just six days before the suit, the plaintiffs received Rs 1,900 crore from the trust,"" the counsel contended, citing Karisma's divorce proceedings with Sunjay.""There were litigations after litigation, and it ended in acrimonious divorce proceedings in the Supreme Court.At the age of 50, a man dies.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday acquitted a death convict in rape-murder of a seven-year-old girl in Uttarakhand in 2014 and said the highest degree of circumspection should be exercised by courts before awarding the death penalty.The gruesome rape-murder was termed as the 'Little Nirbhaya' case and had sparked outrage across the state.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta quashed the trial court and Uttarakhand HC's order to convict him and award the extreme punishment.

Governors can't sit over bills indefinitely: Centre in SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/governors-cant-sit-over-bills-indefinitely-centre-in-sc/articleshow/123818771.cms,"Bihar SIR: SC Slams Political Parties’ Silence, Directs Poll Panel To Accept Aadhaar Or 11 Documents

NEW DELHI: Centre on Wednesday agreed with opposition-led states that governors cannot sit over a bill indefinitely but argued before the Supreme Court that the Constitution had vested in them the discretion to decide whether to grant or withhold assent to legislation, return it with suggestions to the assembly or reserve it for the President's consideration.Responding to opposition-led states' insistence that a governor, being just an ornamental head, cannot choose any of the options without the aid and advice of the council of ministers, solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta said a wrong political canvas has been presented in court to persuade it to transgress Parliament's domain and amend constitutional provisions related to governors' powers to make them rubber stamps at the hands of state govts.While Parliament may amend the Constitution under Article 368 (subject to the basic structure), the judiciary's role is confined to interpretation. If courts were to expand the meaning of a provision beyond its textual or structural limits, it would confer upon the judiciary a power equivalent to Parliament, a result not envisaged by the framers (of the Constitution). Such a course would be contrary to the constitutional scheme,"" Mehta told a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar.After nine days of a riveting constitutional debate on the state-governor spat over bills, the SC's April 8 decision fixing timelines for governors and the President, followed by a Presidential Reference flagging powers of the apex court, Mehta said the Centre agreed with Kerala govt that a governor and a state govt should work collaboratively through consultati-on, with the former acting as a friend, philosopher and guide for the council of ministers.He added that the SC was not the headmaster of polity to address every conceivable issue raised by states which primarily belong to the political arena and which could be resolved through consultation among the PM, CM and ministers with the governor, or the President.This has been the practice in Indian polity because of which democracy has grown stronger and the constitutional provisions, including their interpretations by SC, are followed scrupulously. He said since 1970, governors of states had been presented with 17,150 bills, of which assent was withheld in only 20 bills.He said 933 bills had been reserved for President's consideration by governors, who granted assent to 16,122 (94%) of the bills - 14,402 of the nods coming within a month, 623 within three months, 126 in six months and the rest thereafter.Paying tribute to the framers of the Constitution for giving the governor the right to withhold assent to a bill, something termed by opposition-led states as subversion of the will of the people expressed through legislature, Mehta cited the example of the bill that the Punjab assembly passed in 2004 to terminate its water-sharing agreement with Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi.Should the governor, whom some states term a mere rubber stamp at the hands of the council of ministers, have granted assent to such a bill that would have adversely impacted inter-state, federal and India-Pakistan relations, the SG asked.The governor reserved this bill for consideration of the President, who, in turn, sent a reference seeking SC's opinion on the legality of unilateral annulment of water-sharing agreements, he said, adding that in his view governors in such situations are entitled to withhold assent to protect the constitutional scheme of quasi-federal governance.

These decisions were taken on Wednesday when the Delhi Animal Welfare Board met at Delhi Secretariat under the chairmanship of development minister Kapil Mishra.As part of animal welfare measures following the Supreme Court's recent directive to state govts to come up with street dog policies, the board decided that around one million street dogs in the city would be microchipped over the next two years in collaboration with UNDP. Mishra said the initiative would strengthen rabies control and dog population management.The board will also present a Delhi state action plan on rabies ahead of World Rabies Day, with emphasis on the prevention of dog bites and digitisation of vaccination. A dog census and monitoring system will be implemented for accurate data and planning.The registration of pet shops in the city will also be made mandatory. A special monitoring committee will oversee enforcement. The minister said that all related rules about animal welfare would be implemented soon. He added that regional committees would be activated for monitoring and action at the local level.Another important agenda of the meeting was related to administrative and financial matters.A proposal was put forward to transfer funds from the Delhi Advisory Board for Animal Welfare to the Delhi Animal Welfare Board. The meeting also agreed to set up a standing committee and other sub-committees, recruit new staff, and approve expenditure for the smooth functioning of the board's initiatives.Mishra said govt was committed to providing adequate funds to ensure rapid progress in animal welfare.""Our aim is to ensure that Delhi sets an example for the entire country in this field,"" he said, adding, ""If financial assistance is required at any level, Delhi govt will provide it on priority.""The board will launch awareness programmes in school in collaboration with the education department, while an animal market monitoring committee will also be constituted.Mishra said, ""During the previous govt's tenure, the Animal Welfare Board did not meet for several years. Today, this meeting has been convened to address all pending issues of the Board. All problems related to animals in Delhi will be resolved at the earliest."" Animal welfare committees will be formed at the district level, he added.After having ordered that all street dogs should be rounded up and housed in shelters, the Supreme Court reversed its decision and said instead that dogs that were not rabid or aggressive shouldn't be confined to shelter but sterilised, immunised and released back in the places from where they were picked up.The court also ordered a ban on public feeding of stray dogs and directed the creation of dedicated feeding spaces. It also said that no individual or organisation should obstruct municipal authorities from picking up dogs in accordance with the Animal Birth Control Rules.The last dog survey conducted in 2016 and covering four administrative zones under the then South Municipal Corporation of Delhi had recorded 1,89,285 dogs.
