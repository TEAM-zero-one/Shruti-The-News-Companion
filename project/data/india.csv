NEW DELHI: Kargil war hero Subedar Major and honorary Lieutenant Sanjay Kumar has been given the rank of honorary captain for his long, selfless service to the Army. The Param Vir Chakra recipient is among 2,241 JCOs of the Army who have been conferred honorary commissioned ranks on the eve of Republic Day.Kumar is a legendary officer (13 JAK Rifles) who was awarded India's highest gallantry honour for his heroics in the 1999 Kargil war. On July 4, 1999, he had single-handedly captured Flat Top, Point 4875, by neutralising enemy machine-gun posts despite severe injuries. Kumar's name resonates far beyond military circles for his courage and bravery during the India-Pakistan war.At least 437 JCOs have been elevated to honorary captain rank, while 1,804 JCOs have been conferred the rank of honorary lieutenant, recognising their decades of selfless military service, according to an official notification.Honorary ranks in the Army are conferred on JCOs with impeccable service records who have displayed professional excellence and sterling leadership qualities at unit level. While these ranks - honorary lieutenant and honorary captain- do not alter command structures, they carry deep symbolic value within the armed forces.The number of those given the honour this year highlights the oft-neglected contributions of subedars and subedar majors, who form the bedrock of the Army's functioning. They train young soldiers, preserve regimental traditions, enforce discipline and provide continuity in some of the most challenging operational environments in the world. In addition to the honour and protocol status, these ranks can result in a modest enhancement in pension benefits, depending on applicable rules.","Kumar is a legendary officer (13 jak rifles) who was awarded india's highest gallantry honour for his heroics in the 1999 kargil war.

Beyond the rulebook

When the University Grants Commission ( UGC ), the statutory body under the Union education ministry that regulates universities and colleges, notified its Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026, it introduced a new set of rules that will apply across campuses nationwide.The regulations govern how colleges and universities must prevent, identify, and respond to discrimination involving students, teachers, and staff.On paper, the objective sounds straightforward. It seeks to ensure that no student, teacher, or staff member is denied dignity or opportunity in higher education because of identity.In practice, however, the new regulations reach deep into the everyday functioning of campuses, shaping everything from admissions and hostels to classrooms, committees, and corridors.The 2026 framework replaces the UGC’s earlier equity rules and shifts the burden of compliance squarely onto institutions and their leadership.Heads of universities and colleges are no longer just administrators; they are now the first line of accountability in preventing and responding to discrimination. New structures, new reporting mechanisms, and strict timelines are written into the rulebook, backed by the threat of serious penalties for non-compliance.Yet, as has often been the case with regulations aimed at correcting long-standing social inequities, the real questions lie beneath the stated intent.How wide is the definition of discrimination? How much discretion do institutional committees enjoy? What happens when complaints are contested, or when the process itself causes harm? And how prepared are campuses to balance speed, sensitivity, and fairness? And is it discriminatory against the non-reserved General Class students?The objective clause sets the tone for the entire framework. It seeks to eradicate discrimination only on specified grounds like religion, race, caste, gender, place of birth, and disability.The word “only” is significant, as it confines the scope of the regulations to discrimination based on specified identity grounds, excluding general grievances or academic disputes.At the same time, the regulations explicitly prioritise certain groups, including:This prioritisation reflects a remedial approach, focusing on historically disadvantaged communities, while formally keeping the protection available to all stakeholders.The definitions section is one of the most consequential parts of the regulations.“Discrimination” is defined broadly to include not only explicit acts but also implicit, indirect, or structural forms of unfair treatment.It extends to actions that have the effect of impairing equality or violating human dignity, even if discriminatory intent is not overt.“Caste-based discrimination” is defined as discrimination against members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes.Importantly, the regulation does not create separate categories of discrimination for different groups but subsumes them within a common framework.“Equity” is defined as providing a level playing field for all stakeholders with respect to rights and opportunities.Together, these definitions significantly expand the interpretive space available to committees tasked with examining complaints. At the same time, the breadth of these definitions leaves substantial discretion with institutional committees.Terms such as implicit or indirect discrimination, structural unfairness, and impairment of dignity are not further qualified in the regulations, offering limited guidance on thresholds of proof or standards of assessment.This ambiguity may allow flexibility in addressing complex forms of disadvantage, but it also opens the door to uneven interpretation across institutions, particularly in contested cases where intent is disputed or where academic or administrative decisions intersect with allegations of discrimination.Every higher education institution (HEI) is required to establish an Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC). The Centre is tasked with a wide range of functions, including policy implementation, counselling, outreach, awareness-building, and grievance handling.Smaller colleges that lack sufficient faculty strength are allowed to rely on the EOC of their affiliating university, ensuring that the requirement applies uniformly across institutions.The EOC is also expected to coordinate with civil society organisations, local administration, police authorities, and legal services bodies. This expansive mandate reflects an attempt to situate campus equity within a broader social and legal ecosystem.Each Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC) must have an Equity Committee, constituted by the head of the institution. Its composition is carefully structured to include:The regulations mandate representation of women, SCs, STs, OBCs, and persons with disabilities within the committee. The committee is required to meet at least twice a year and to review action taken on complaints.The committee’s core role is to inquire into allegations of discrimination and submit a report with findings and recommendations.Beyond formal committees, the regulations introduce two novel mechanisms: Equity Squads and Equity Ambassadors.Equity Squads are smaller, mobile bodies tasked with maintaining vigilance and visiting “vulnerable spots” on campus. Equity Ambassadors are designated individuals in departments, hostels, libraries, and other units who act as nodal points for reporting violations.These mechanisms signal a shift towards continuous monitoring, rather than complaint-driven intervention alone. While intended as preventive measures, they also raise questions about overreach, informal surveillance, and the potential chilling effect on campus interactions.Every HEI must operate a round-the-clock Equity Helpline. Any stakeholder in distress due to discrimination can access it, and confidentiality of the complainant’s identity must be maintained if requested.Where a prima facie case under penal law is disclosed, the information is to be forwarded to the police. This provision effectively links campus grievance mechanisms with the criminal justice system, raising the stakes for both complainants and the accused.The procedure for handling discrimination complaints is tightly time-bound.An aggrieved person can report an incident through an online portal, email, written complaint, or the helpline. Upon receipt, the Equity Committee must meet within 24 hours to decide on the next steps.The committee has 15 working days to submit its report, after which the head of the institution has seven working days to initiate action. In cases involving the head of the institution, the coordinator of the EOC chairs the inquiry.While the timelines aim to ensure prompt action, they also raise concerns about whether complex allegations can be examined thoroughly within such compressed periods.Any person aggrieved by the Equity Committee’s report can appeal to the Ombudsperson within 30 days. The Ombudsperson may appoint an amicus curiae and is expected to dispose of appeals within another 30 days.This appellate mechanism provides an external check on institutional processes. However, it primarily addresses procedural correctness, rather than offering substantive relief for non-tangible harms such as reputational damage or mental distress.The regulations empower the UGC to monitor compliance through inspections, information requests, and national-level committees. Non-compliant institutions face serious consequences, including:These penalties indicate that equity compliance is not optional, but a condition for institutional legitimacy.Despite the breadth of the framework, the regulations are silent on several issues that are likely to shape their reception and operation on campuses. While they lay out detailed mechanisms for receiving and processing complaints, they do not spell out comparable safeguards for non-reserved individuals who may be accused of discrimination, particularly in cases where allegations are contested or later found to be unsubstantiated.There is no explicit provision dealing with malicious or knowingly false complaints, nor is there any guidance on how institutions should distinguish between bona fide grievances and those driven by personal disputes, academic disagreements, or animosity unrelated to identity-based discrimination. The absence of such clarity places a significant burden on institutional committees to exercise judgment, increasing the risk of inconsistent outcomes across campuses.The regulations also do not acknowledge the mental and reputational impact that the complaint process itself can have on the accused. There are no provisions for interim confidentiality for respondents, counselling support during the inquiry, or mechanisms to repair reputational harm if allegations are ultimately not upheld. In tightly knit academic environments, even the initiation of an inquiry can have lasting professional and psychological consequences, irrespective of the final outcome.Another area of concern relates to timelines. While the emphasis on speed is intended to ensure prompt redressal for complainants, the compressed schedule may limit the ability of committees to examine complex factual disputes, especially those involving academic judgment or administrative discretion. In such cases, the pressure to meet deadlines could inadvertently prioritise procedural closure over substantive fairness.The linkage of campus mechanisms with law enforcement, particularly through the equity helpline, further raises the stakes. While intended to ensure swift action in serious cases, this provision may deter open academic engagement or encourage defensive decision-making by administrators wary of escalation beyond the institution.Historically, similar regulatory frameworks in higher education and other sectors have tended to correct outcomes through appellate or judicial review, while leaving the harms caused during the process largely unaddressed. Appeals may overturn findings or set aside penalties, but they rarely compensate for stress, stigma, or disruption suffered in the interim. In the absence of explicit procedural safeguards, this gap is likely to remain.Taken together, these omissions do not negate the objectives of the regulations, but they point to areas where further clarification or supplementary guidelines may be required. How these concerns are handled, whether through institutional practice, regulatory advisories, or future amendments, will play a key role in determining whether the framework strengthens trust on campuses or becomes a source of sustained friction.The question arises because the regulations draw explicit distinctions by prioritising protections for historically disadvantaged groups, while applying a common framework to all stakeholders.Article 14 guarantees equality before the law, but past judicial practice has allowed differential treatment where it is linked to a legitimate objective and applied through non-arbitrary procedures. In that sense, the regulations are framed as remedial rather than exclusionary, focusing on identity-based disadvantage in higher education.However, concerns stem less from the stated objective and more from the structure of implementation. The wide discretion granted to institutional committees, combined with broadly worded definitions of discrimination and the absence of explicit safeguards for those accused, particularly from the unreserved General Class, has led some to question whether outcomes could vary unevenly across campuses. Critics argue that unequal application, rather than unequal text, could create situations where similarly placed individuals are treated differently in practice.The 2026 equity regulations introduce a far-reaching framework for addressing discrimination and inclusion in higher education, expanding the role of institutional mechanisms and regulatory oversight. They formalise a set of duties, procedures, and enforcement tools that universities and colleges will be required to follow.However, the way the framework functions in practice will depend on how institutions interpret and apply its provisions. The manner in which discretion is exercised, timelines are enforced, and contested complaints are handled will shape whether the regulations operate as intended or generate friction within campuses.","Promotion of equity in higher education institutions regulations, 2026. The regulations govern how colleges and universities must prevent, identify, and respond to discrimination involving students, teachers, and staff. New structures, new reporting mechanisms, and strict timelines are written into the rulebook.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127388943,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-100582,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

The stage is decorated... there is lighting, music... there is all the pomp and show, and the atmosphere is no less than a concert.It feels like a huge concert, but what is being sung there is the resonance of bhajans sung with complete concentration, dedication, and rhythm. This trend is being called ‘bhajan-clubbing’ today, and it’s becoming increasingly popular, especially among Gen Z,” he added.Modi also praised the efforts of the Indian community in Malaysia towards language diversity in schools, highlighting that now there are more than 500 Tamil schools in Malaysia. In addition to teaching the Tamil language, other subjects are also taught in Tamil. In his address, PM also lauded the UAE’s initiative to declare 2026 as the ‘Year of the Family’, likening it to India’s family system which is part of the country’s traditions.Reiterating the govt’s thrust on manufacturing high quality products in India, PM urged industry and start-ups to focus on quality and resolve to make excellence a benchmark in manufacturing. “Let us resolve to improve the quality of whatever we manufacture. Be it our textiles, technology, electronics or even packaging; an Indian product should become synonymous with top quality,” he said. “The era of ‘it just happens” and “it will go through somehow’ (chalta hai) is over. Come, let us prioritise quality with all our might this year. Let our only mantra be quality, quality and only quality,” Modi said.","Pm narendra modi praised the youth for embracing the emerging trend of ‘bhajan-clubbing’ he said it is a powerful blend of devotion, culture, spirituality and modernity. ‘bhajans’ have been the soul of indian culture for centuries, he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127507426,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-605257,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Gridlock forces many tourists trek downhill from Manali



.

KULLU: A 10-hour traffic crawl for 15km. Sub-zero cold. Tourists ditch cars, walk on ice.Thousands of tourists remained stranded in Manali for a second straight day Sunday as icy roads and an unprecedented traffic surge brought the popular hill town in Himachal Pradesh's Kullu district to a standstill.Exit routes out of Manali were the worst hit. Slippery stretches and tailgating vehicles produced jams stretching more than 10km, all the way to the 15 Mile point near Patlikuhal, a small market town lower down the valley where snow had begun melting.A viral video allegedly shot around 2.30 am Sunday showed tourists hauling trolley bags across ice, some slipping and falling. ""This is the situation of people who rushed to Manali, ended up stranded,"" wrote an X user, @rose_k01. For hundreds, the ordeal stretched through the night. Buses, taxis and cars barely moved as mercury plunged below freezing. Many, including children, spent Saturday night shivering inside vehicles. ""It took us 12 hours just to reach Patlikuhal,"" said Kulwinder Singh from Ferozepur, Punjab. ""We spent the night shivering in the car. I have never seen such a nightmarish traffic jam.""This is the situation of people who rushed to Manali, ended up stranded,” wrote an X user, @rose_k01.For hundreds, the ordeal stretched through the night.

Many, including children, spent Saturday night shivering inside vehicles. “It took us 12 hours just to reach Patlikuhal,” said Kulwinder Singh from Ferozepur, Punjab. “We spent the night shivering in the car. I have never seen such a nightmarish traffic jam.”The distance from Manali to Patlikuhal is roughly 15km. For many, it took more than 10 hours.Despite snow-clearing efforts by NHAI, icy patches and sheer traffic volume rendered the two-lane Kullu-Manali highway nearly impassable. Weather stayed largely clear through Saturday and Sunday, but the road did not.Frustration boiled over. Desperate to escape, several tourists abandoned vehicles and trekked downhill on foot toward Patlikuhal. “This is easily the worst jam I’ve ever seen,” said Himanshu Sharma, a tourist from Noida. “I can reach Patlikuhal faster on foot than by car.”As thousands tried to get out, thousands more attempted to get in — chasing snowfall in Manali. Police blocked fresh inflow at Patlikuhal and Bhuntar, the valley town near Kullu airport. “We are only allowing 4x4 vehicles beyond Patlikuhal to prioritise evacuation of stranded tourists,” said Manali DSP K D Sharma. Kullu SP Madan Lal called the rush unprecedented. About 200 police personnel have been deployed round the clock, but the narrow mountain highway remains overwhelmed.More trouble may be coming. The Met office in Shimla has forecast another spell of heavy rain and snow from the night of Jan 26 through Jan 28. A severe cold wave continues across the Himalayan state. Tabo village in the remote Lahaul-Spiti district recorded the state’s lowest temperature Sunday at -10 degrees Celsius. Manali dropped to -1.1 degrees C.","Exit routes out of manali were the worst hit. Slippery stretches and tailgating vehicles produced jams stretching more than 10km.

Hinterland's 'unsung heroes' on Padma rolls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hinterlands-unsung-heroes-on-padma-rolls/articleshow/127517968.cms,"ANI file photo

.

NEW DELHI: In keeping with its practice of taking the Padma awards' focus away from big cities and well-known names and to recognise hinterland talents in a wide spectrum of fields, the Modi govt picked this year's awardees from 84 districts spread across 30 states and UTs. Ten districts figure on the list for the first time since Independence, officials noted.Among such ""unsung heroes"", as officials described them, are Taga Ram Bheel, recognised for reviving Rajasthan's fading folk instrument Algoza, and Meghalaya-based environmentalist Hally War.Former Indian tennis star Vijay Amritraj, based in the US, is among the six Padma Bhushan awardees under foreigners/NRI/PIO/OCI.A maximum 15 winners are officially from Maharashtra, including the likes of actors Dharmendra and R Madhavan - one of the key characters in 'Dhurandhar', said to have been inspired by NSA Ajit Doval - who found their calling in the state, followed by 13 from Tamil Nadu and 11 each from West Bengal and UP. Eight each are from Karnataka and Kerala, including Vellappally Natesan, a functionary of SNDP - an outfit that has positioned itself as the vehicle of Izhavas, the single most numerically preponderant caste in Kerala - and a BJP ally in Tamil Nadu.Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Kerala are heading to assembly polls, though official sources were quick to point out that govt has annually tried to give a diverse representation regionally, selecting the awardees from 84 districts across the country.Former IPS officer K Vijay Kumar, associated with the killing of notorious sandalwood smuggler Veerappan, Armind Fernandez, who established Asia's first human milk bank, and ex-Prasar Bharati CEO Shashi Shekhar Vempati, hockey player Savita Punia are among the other Padma winners besides politicians Bhagat Singh Kosher and late V K Malhotra, both from BJP.Achuthanandhan, a vocal and popular former Kerala CM, and Soren join other veteran politicians from non-BJP backgrounds like Mulayam Singh Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan who got Padma recognition from this govt.Padma Shri awardees include former MHA functionary R V Mani, who had protested against a change of affidavit in the Ishrat Jehan encounter case. In his book, 'Hindu Terror: Insider account of Ministry of Home Affairs 2006-2010', Mani alleged he was pressured by the UPA govt to sign a second affidavit that fabricated a narrative of ""Saffron Terror"".Officials said govt made extensive efforts to identify achievers from all corners, highlighting that over 39,000 nominations were received and evaluated through an exhaustive and rigorous process of multiple rounds of scrutiny and consultation with ministry, state administration and domain experts. Awardees included 48 super senior citizens (80 years and above) and many from traditionally deprived sections of society.","The modi govt picked this year's awardees from 84 districts spread across 30 states and uts.

ED attaches 37 properties of Pearl Agro,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-attaches-37-properties-of-pearl-agro/articleshow/127515574.cms,"Image: IANS

NEW DELHI: Pearl Agro Corp Ltd, a multi-level marketing firm that promised plot allotments to lakhs across the country and deceived investors and regulators for nearly two decades, raised more than Rs 60,000 crore and siphoned off most of it into personal assets in India and abroad, according to an ED probe report. On Sunday, ED said it has managed to locate 37 properties of the accused in Ludhiana and Jaipur worth Rs 2,000 crore and attached these.The total attachment in the case has reached Rs 7,600 crore, ED said. The fresh attachment includes a prime land close to Jaipur airport worth over Rs 1,500 crore, sources said. In less than two months, between Dec and now, the agency has attached assets of PACL and its promoter Nirmal Singh Bhangoo, worth over Rs 6,000 crore, in its ongoing money laundering investigation in the case.An estimate by Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which is also probing the case, revealed that nearly six crore investors have been cheated by Bhangoo and his associates over the past two decades. The magnitude of the crime is such that Supreme Court constituted a committee headed by Justice RM Lodha to ensure smooth restitution of lost money through the sale of assets attached by ED.The main accused and promoter of PACL, Bhangoo, has died and his wife Prem Kaur, two daughters Barinder and Sukhwinder Kaur, son-in-law Gurpratap Singh and close associate Prateek Kumar are wanted by ED to establish the money trail.The accused are absconding - not joining the investigation - while non-bailable warrants have been issued against them, according to a senior official.Despite CBI and Punjab police having registered multiple FIRs, since as early as 2014, against Bhangoo and his associates, the probe did not achieve much as the ""proceeds of crime"" could not be traced. The initial money trail established by ED revealed the accused had siphoned off the money by depositing them in Kolkata-based shell companies, withdrawing cash and then laundering them to Dubai through hawala dealers to buy hotels and resorts overseas, including Australia.ED began its money laundering probe in 2016 and has filed three prosecution complaints (chargesheets) so far while investigation is still in progress to identify assets of the accused. In 2018, ED had attached two properties of the accused in Australia worth Rs 462 crore. Investors across Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Maharashtra, Telengana, Karnataka, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand have lost their money to the collective investment, or ponzi scheme.The attached assets once confirmed by the PMLA adjudicating authority are confiscated by ED, and the details of these properties are then shared with Justice Lodha Committee, appointed by the SC for overseeing the process of disposing of properties and to refund the amount to investors, according to a senior ED official.","Pearl agro corp ltd raised more than rs 60,000 crore and siphoned off most of it into personal assets in india and abroad.

“Invitation To Nation Building”: PM Modi Hands Over 61,000 Appointment Letters At 18th Rozgar Mela

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi Sunday described voters as the soul of democracy and called for celebrating the youth, who have come of age, as individuals who hold the power to transform the destiny of the country.School and college campuses can be hubs for movements that ensure every eligible youth is enrolled as a voter, the PM said, emphasising that the National Voters' Day is an ideal occasion for the movement and celebrations every year.Modi's emphasis on the importance of voters in a letter to volunteers of MY-Bharat, a govt-run youth empowerment initiative, appeared to be a pointed counter to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's ""vote chori"" campaign against his govt and Election Commission.The Prime Minister said that to be a voter is the ""greatest privilege and responsibility in a democracy"". ""The voter is the Bhagya Vidhata of our development journey,"" he said. ""Our first-time voters should be welcomed into democracy as individuals who hold the power to transform the destiny of our country,"" he added.Modi said that he was connecting with them as a fellow citizen who takes great pride in Indian democracy.This year marks the 75th anniversary of the first general election which illustrated the inherent democratic spirit of Indians, he emphasised. That indelible ink on a finger is a badge of honour that ensures democracy remains vibrant and purposeful, Modi added.He said that ""at home and in our residential societies, we can celebrate the same (first-time voters) by sharing sweets. Our schools and colleges have a vital role to play as nurseries of democratic values."" It should be observed joyously like a birthday, the Prime Minister added.""People's commitment to voting is so deep that whether they live high in the Himalayas, in the islands of Andaman and Nicobar, in deserts or in dense forests, they turn up to ensure their voice is heard,""Modi said.He also touched on the issue in his monthly 'Mann ki Baat' broadcast, lauding voters as the soul of democracy.In his letter, Modi said the participation of women, especially young ones, is crucial for an inclusive democracy. The volunteers of the platform - MY-Bharat - belong to a generation that does not wait for things to happen, but actively participates in making things happen with a ""can do"" spirit, he said, asking them to spread awareness about the importance of becoming a voter.The Prime Minister said, ""Let us resolve to make every effort towards strengthening our democracy and creating a developed, inclusive and self-reliant Bharat.""","The prime minister said that to be a voter is the ""greatest privilege and responsibility in a democracy"" school and college campuses can be hubs for movements that ensure every eligible youth is enrolled as a voter, the pm said.

UGC issues new rules to curb caste bias as plaints up 118%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ugc-issues-new-rules-to-curb-caste-bias-as-plaints-up-118/articleshow/127513368.cms,"Image: IANS

NEW DELHI: A fresh regulatory push aims at making India's campuses safer and more inclusive, with the University Grants Commission (UGC) rolling out a strengthened framework to curb caste-based discrimination across universities and colleges.The move comes as complaints of caste-linked bias have more than doubled over five years - rising 118.4% from 173 in 2019-20 to 378 in 2023-24 - and amid sustained judicial scrutiny over student welfare in institutions.Crucially, the new framework shifts the burden of action squarely onto institutions, making campus leadership directly accountable for preventing discrimination and responding to complaints in a time-bound manner.Notified last week, the UGC (Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions) Regulations, 2026 replace the 2012 rules and significantly widen their scope.For the first time, caste-based discrimination is explicitly defined to cover scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other backward classes, correcting a key gap in the draft framework. The regulations also broaden the meaning of discrimination to include unfair treatment on grounds of caste, religion, gender, disability and place of birth, and any act that undermines human dignity or equality in educationAt the institutional level, every higher education institution is now required to set up an Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC) to drive inclusion and support disadvantaged students, which will be backed by an Equity Committee headed by the institution chief.These committees must include representation from SCs, STs, OBCs, women and persons with disabilities, and are mandated to meet at least twice a year.EOCs will publish bi-annual reports detailing campus demographics, dropout rates, complaints received and their status, introducing a new layer of transparency.The rules also provide for round-the-clock equity helplines, mobile ""equity squads"" to monitor vulnerable campus spaces, and designated ""equity ambassadors"" across hostels, departments and facilities to flag violations early.Complaints must trigger a committee meeting within 24 hours, with institutions required to act within fixed timelines. Appeals can be taken to an ombudsperson.Crucially, UGC has armed itself with sharper enforcement tools. Institutions that fail to comply with teh regulations can be barred from UGC schemes, stopped from offering degree or online programmes, and in extreme cases removed from the UGC's recognised list - a step that effectively strips an institution of its academic standing.A national-level monitoring committee, with representatives from professional councils and civil society, will oversee implementation and review cases of discrimination at least twice a year.UGC data shows that Equal Opportunity Cells have already received over 1,500 complaints in recent years, even as audits point to uneven resolution and patchy documentation. Supreme Court has repeatedly sought caste-wise data from regulators, underlining the need for credible reporting on the issue.Vice-chancellors say the new framework marks a shift from advisory guidelines to enforceable obligations. Whether it delivers lasting change will depend on transparent data, independent oversight and consistent follow-through - measures that will now decide how far India's campuses move from policy intent to lived equity.","University grants commission rolls out strengthened framework to curb caste-based discrimination across universities and colleges.

RJD Elevates Tejashwi as Working President, Sister Rohini Flags ‘Conspiracy’

PATNA: RJD chief Lalu Prasad's younger son, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, was on Sunday named the national working president of the party at its national executive meeting, marking a quiet transfer of power to the younger generation. The decision comes at a time when the state's principal opposition party is battling for political survival and facing the challenge of keeping the 28-year-old outfit intact.Lalu has largely stayed away from party meetings and programmes in recent years due to age-related health complications. Against this backdrop, Tejashwi's elevation is being seen as a decisive step towards organisational continuity and generational transition within the RJD.Soon after being named national working president, Tejashwi, who is currently the leader of the opposition in the Bihar assembly, said he would take the BJP head-on and launch a nationwide campaign against the party in the coming days. ""For this, I will tour other states and talk to leaders of other anti-BJP political parties in the country to launch a strong campaign against BJP at the national level,"" he said.He also announced a united fight against the BJP-led NDA . ""Hamlog milkar ladenge (We will fight unitedly),"" Tejashwi said, adding that Lalu had never compromised with his ideology and that he would follow the same path.Expressing confidence in shouldering the new responsibility, he said he would undertake an extensive tour of Bihar after Holi and work towards securing national party status for the RJD.Urging party workers not to lose heart, Tejashwi said the RJD-led INDIA bloc had secured a record 1.90 crore votes in the polls. ""We may have lost elections but not the courage. We will continue to move forward on our mission and will be successful,"" he said. ""We were ahead in 107 constituencies in postal ballot but the NDA got victory in EVM counting."" Acknowledging that the current phase was difficult, he said the party would eventually emerge victorious.","Rjd elevates tejashwi as working president, sister rohini flags ‘conspiracy’ the decision comes at a time when the state's principal opposition party is battling for political survival.

"Body found by cops not that of wife, man acquitted after 8 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/body-found-by-cops-not-that-of-wife-man-acquitted-after-8-years/articleshow/127510408.cms,".

GHAZIABAD: A man jailed for nearly eight years for allegedly murdering his wife and dumping her body in a drain was acquitted after the court found gaping holes in the prosecution story - starting with the most basic question that whether the body police recovered was even that of the missing woman.The additional sessions court also held that the prosecution failed to establish any motive for the alleged murder, and that the case, built entirely on circumstantial evidence, did not form an unbroken chain that pointed only to the accused.Rajiv Poddar, originally from Darbhanga in Bihar, was arrested on Aug 28, 2018, under sections 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) of IPC in connection with the disappearance of his wife, Sanjana. He had remained in jail since then, with even the Allahabad High Court rejecting his bail plea. On Thursday, the additional sessions court ordered his immediate release after acquitting him of all charges.The case began with an FIR being lodged at Vijaynagar police station on Aug 19, 2018, by Poddar himself, alleging that his wife was missing.On Aug 25 that year, when police recovered the body of a woman from a drain, Sanjana's brother, Rajesh, identified it as his sister's and alleged that Poddar must have killed her and disposed of the body.A case was registered on Aug 27 and Poddar was arrested the next day.During trial, the defence argued that the prosecution could never prove that the recovered body was Sanjana's. ""The body of the deceased unidentified woman was unidentifiable. The plaintiff's evidence does not clearly state the basis on which he identified the deceased as his sister, Sanjana, nor did the prosecution produce any witness to prove that the body of the deceased unidentified woman was actually that of Sanjana,"" defence counsel DK Mishra and Vikas Chaturvedi submitted.The case also involved a second body - that of a child - found along with the woman's body. Both bodies were mutilated, and the child's body was never identified - a gap that further complicated the prosecution's narrative about who the victims were and what exactly happened.The defence also argued that Poddar and Sanjana had three children, all of whom were with their father at home.A key discrepancy highlighted in court was between the complainant's claim of identification and the body's measurements recorded by investigators and medical evidence, which did not conclusively match Sanjana's description. The court noted that without reliable identification, the prosecution's central claim - that Sanjana was murdered and that the recovered body was hers - remained unproven.Police filed a chargesheet on Nov 6, 2018. A case under the Arms Act was registered over a knife that cops said was the murder weapon.But the court found the recovery doubtful. It recorded that prosecution witnesses admitted the recovery spot was a road frequented by people. ""Members of the public were also present at the time of the recovery, but the recovery report did not name any witnesses,"" the court noted.The judge said the prosecution's evidence did not establish a complete chain of circumstances, did not prove motive, and did not show that Poddar disposed of the body to destroy evidence.","Rajiv poddar, originally from darbhanga in bihar, was arrested on aug 28, 2018, under sections 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) he had remained in jail since then, with even the allahabad high court rejecting his bail plea.

‘Justice Delayed Is Justice Destroyed’: CJI Kant Calls High Courts Key Guardians Of Citizens’ Rights

SC order puts end to judiciary-rlys tussle over

manpower row

NEW DELHI: Citing the age-old proverb that 'No man shall be a judge in his own cause', Supreme Court has said the same is applicable to a judge also and they cannot pass an order in a case concerning themselves.A railway magistrate had initiated proceedings against railway administration and its officials, issuing a showcause notice for not providing him with requisite staff for checking tickets on rail premises and penalising offenders. But a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and N K Singh reversed the Punjab and Haryana HC's order in the magistrate's favour. ""It is a case where the learned railway magistrate wants to become a judge of his own cause,"" SC said.The communication sent by him (the railway magistrate) to appellant no. 3 (senior divisional commercial manager of Northern Railways) cannot be termed as a judicial proceeding. In any case, the appellants have not acted beyond their official capacity,” the SC bench added.Supreme Court’s order brought to an end the tug-of-war between judiciary and railways administration arising out of criminal proceedings initiated against the commercial manager of Northern Railways for not providing sufficient manpower to the judicial officer.Special railway magistrate (SRM) at Ambala had passed the order and lodged a complaint against the officer, on grounds that he was being prevented from discharging his duties.The SRM conducts checks which are known as ‘magisterial checks’ to detect passengers travelling without tickets and also to punish persons guilty of other offences as provided under Railways Act. After not being provided with manpower to conduct ticket checks, the SRM had said it was a prima facie case of interference in his judicial functioning and issued a showcause notice to the railways official and a complaint was sent to chief judicial magistrate, Ambala, for trial.The railways administration and commercial manager of Northern Railways then moved Punjab and Haryana high court, which rejected their plea. The HC said the petitioner’s move to withdraw the checking staff was not only unfair but also reprimandable and directed the railways authorities to make available checking staff. “None of the railways authorities has any power to oust the jurisdiction of special railway magistrate in this regard,” HC said.But SC disagreed with the reasoning and quashed the proceedings in the case.",A railway magistrate had initiated proceedings against railway administration and its officials. He had issued a showcause notice for not providing him with requisite staff for checking tickets on rail premises and penalising offenders.

CHENNAI:

Rhinoceros, now found only in the swampy grasslands and riverine forests of Assam, Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, roamed the foothills of the Western Ghats near Coimbatore some 3,500 years ago, archaeologists say.A team identified four bone fragments — two metacarpals and two carpals of the foot of an Indian rhino — at Molapalayam, a neolithic site. During the two seasons of excavations in 2021 and 2024 at the site, archaeologists unearthed a huge collection of bone fragments of 28 species of animals, including the Indian rhino.“The anatomical features of the bones match the rhino bones available in the reference collection,” said Abhayan G S, a faculty member at the department of archaeology, University of Kerala, who studied the samples with research scholar Ajith M.This is the third such find in south India after the bone fragments of a rhino were found in Payyampalli in Tirupattur district, and a fragmented skull of a fossilised rhino in Sathankulam in Tuticorin district. “This is a significant find as rhinos survived up to the middle of the second millennium BCE. According to the current zoogeography, the animal is restricted to Assam and north-eastern plains of India,” Abhayan said.The animal needs grasslands and marshes. “The foothills of the Western Ghats might have had grassland, as a single rhino requires many square kilometres of grassland for food,” said zooarchaeologist Pramod Joglekar, a retired professor of archaeology at Deccan College.“In Gujarat and Haryana, too, we found bone remains of the Indian rhino from the Harappan period. We also found bone remains in Odisha. It shows that rhinos were once spread across the Indian subcontinent,” he said.Archaeologist V Selvakumar of the department of maritime history and maritime archaeology at Tamil University, Thanjavur, who excavated the Molapalayam site, presented a paper on the finding at an international symposium on recent scientific studies in archaeology of Tamil Nadu in Madurai on Saturday.“A faunal analysis reveals that people who lived here constituted a pastoral community that reared cattle, sheep and goat. They also hunted animals such as deer and antelope. Their food also included a diverse range of small millets and pulses,” Selvakumar said.Researchers Sathish Naik and Aditya of Deccan College identified plants from the site. An analysis of bone fragments at the site found 28 species of animals, including cattle, buffalo, goat, sheep, pig and dog, and wild animals such as nilgai, blackbuck, four-horned antelope, gazelle, chital and sambar deer, besides the Indian rhino.Radiocarbon dating has assigned 1,600 BCE to 1,400 BCE as the period of the site.","Rhinoceros roamed foothills of western ghats near coimbatore some 3,500 years ago.

JAMMU
