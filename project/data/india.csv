Thirukkural

Book of Ethics

Book of Wealth

Book of Love

Those who have virtuous children, that none reproach, can escape from the touch of evil in the maze of seven births

Friends who wiped our tears will be fondly remembered all through our seven births.

One generation blessed with learning will benefit seven generations to come.

He who avoids deeds praised by the wise will be despised in seven births.

A fool may, in a single birth, create a hell he must endure for seven births.

He left only yesterday, yet it feels as if seven days have passed.

Thankkuvamai illadhaan thaal serndharkku allaal

Manakkavalai matral aridhu.

Unless you surrender to His feet, to whom none compare,

No anxiety of the mind can be removed.

There are numbers we count with, and then there are numbers we live with.The number seven belongs to the latter.It hums quietly in the background — seven swaras that shape every melody, seven colours of a rainbow, seven days that cradle a week. It shapes the wonders we marvel at, the seas we dream of crossing, and even the bones that hold our heads high.In Tirupati, the Lord resides on seven hills. In Christianity, the divine trinity and earthly elements together add upto seven. In Islam, pilgrims circle the Kaaba seven times. In Hindu weddings, seven steps —— bind the two souls for life. Even in unseen realms, there are seven heavens above and seven worlds below.Did Valluvar , too, feel the pull of this number? Seven is hidden, almost like a secret signature, in the very architecture of the. Each couplet is made up of exactly seven words. The epic itself has 133 chapters. 1 + 3 + 3 = 7. Total couplets: 1,330. Again, 1 + 3 + 3 + 0 = 7.The three divisions of the Kural whisper the same pattern.: 34 chapters. 3 + 4 = 7.: 70 chapters. 7 + 0 = 7.: 25 chapters. 2 + 5 = 7.This was no accident. Valluvar’s structure was his shield. In an age when poems were easily interpolated, he made sure no stray verse could slip into his work without disturbing the harmony of his sevens.Kural 62:Kural 107:Kural 398:Kural 538:Kural 835:And then there is the tender ache of separation. Kural 1269 and 1278 speak of a woman waiting for her lover:My favourite is the seventh couplet itself:Life is fragile. Nature rages, wars scar the earth, grief stalks the living, and we stumble, uncertain of our script. And yet, there is one moment of clarity: the moment of surrender.For in surrender, the burden shifts. I place my anxieties in His keeping and find myself free.Who am I, but a drop in the ocean of His kindness? And yet — a drop that belongs. Perhaps that is the true secret of seven: not that it completes the count, but that it reminds us we are already whole.The wheel turns again.Seven births, seven days, seven colours, seven notes;each cycle returning us to where we began, reminding us that wholeness is not reached at the end of the journey, but in every step along the circle of seven.","Thirukkural is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality.

'Atom Bomb Hay, Fatega': Rahul Gandhi Warns EC Over Bihar SIR, Oppn Demand Parliament Showdown

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission (EC) on Friday said it prefers to ignore Rahul Gandhi 's baseless allegations of ""vote theft"" and has asked all poll officials to continue working in an impartial and transparent manner, unfazed by his repeated threats and ""deplorable"" statements.In a post on X, the commission said it was unfortunate that Rahul was hurling unfounded allegations at EC and poll officials and repeatedly threatening them through media statements with irresponsible phrases like 'vote chori', ""over a year after conclusion of the Lok Sabha poll"".He said neither Rahul nor Congress availed of options available under the law, such as appeals against wrongful inclusion or exclusion of electors by the ERO in the final roll or challenging an election by filing an election petition within the stipulated time (45 days after declaration of result).EC said that it had sent a mail to Rahul Gandhi on June 12 after he alleged irregularities in Maharashtra polls, in a newspaper article. He was asked to write to the EC directly or meet the panel, but he did not respond. Interestingly, none of the allegations made by Rahul in his article, or any other grievance of his, has been directly communicated to EC. ""It is very strange and deplorable that he is making wild allegations and has now even started threatening EC and its staff,"" EC said.In the post on X, the commission underlined that while Rahul Gandhi has been attacking EC over alleged ""vote theft"" during the Lok Sabha poll in Karnataka, the fact is that the electoral roll was prepared by 31 district election officers, 419 electoral registration officers (EROs) and assistant EROs and 58,834 booth level officers (BLOs), with the due involvement of booth level agents appointed by all political parties.","The election commission (ec) has asked all poll officials to continue working in an impartial and transparent manner.

NEW DELHI: Congress functionary Rahul Gandhi Friday said his party has collected ""atom bomb"" of evidence to prove that EC is helping BJP steal votes, stepping up his attack on ""vote chori"" on a day he led the joint opposition in writing to Lok Sabha Speaker demanding an immediate discussion on the review of electoral rolls in Bihar. The opposition told Speaker that the issue has a direct bearing on the ""right to vote"" and ""conduct of free and fair elections"", and merits an urgent debate.Talking about Congress' probe, likely about voters' list for Bangalore Rural LS seat, Rahul told reporters, ""What we found is atom bomb; I mean EC will be blown away when that atom bomb explodes"". The opposition's letter to Om Birla - signed by Congress, DMK, NCP-SP, RSP, SS-UBT, SP, TMC and RJD - expressed serious concern over the Bihar poll roll revision being done just before elections. It said EC has also announced the exercise will be done nationally, despite apprehensions about ""transparency, timing and intent of process"".The letter said the opposition had on several occasions listed a discussion on SIR as a priority, but the Modi govt has not notified a date yet.As he doubled down on his allegations, Rahul warned that officials involved in the ""theft"" will not be spared. ""...because you are working against India, which is treason.Remember, wherever you are, whether retired or whatever, we will find you,"" he said. Rahul argued that Congress had suspicions after assembly polls in MP, which solidified after LS polls, and were further deepened with Maharashtra contest last year. Since EC was not helping with voters' lists, the party conducted its own deep dive into voters data.Meanwhile, BJP Friday took a swipe at Rahul's ""atom bomb"" claim, asking him to ""flow like water"" instead of ""exploding like a bomb"". ""If they explode a bomb, we will save Constitution,"" said BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra. He said the Opposition speaks of such things because they have no faith in democracy.","Congress functionary rahul gandhi friday said his party has collected ""atom bomb"" of evidence to prove that ec is helping bjp steal votes.

NEW DELHI: Telangana chief minister A Revanth Reddy found himself at the centre of a political and media storm on Friday after remarks he made about young journalists drew sharp criticism from press bodies and social media users alike.The comments came during the 10th anniversary celebration of Telugu daily Nava Telangana, where he contrasted senior journalists' dedication with what he described as the arrogance and lack of etiquette among younger reporters.""To analyse, they (journalists) keep their health and families at stake. To understand the problems of people, they go to remote areas for days and stay in public to publish their findings,"" Reddy said, praising senior journalists.

They don’t even have the common sense to stand up when those senior journalists come. .. I sometimes feel like slapping them.

NEW DELHI: Tension gripped Yavat village in Daund tehsil of Pune district on Friday afternoon after an allegedly objectionable WhatsApp post by a youth from another community sparked violence.An irate mob vandalised properties and set a motorcycle ablaze, prompting police to use teargas and resort to a lathi charge to disperse crowds.Officials confirm no injuries or casualties, and say the situation is now under control, reported PTI.Police said the objectionable post was allegedly related to a Hindu religious figure.The post went viral Friday afternoon, sparking anger in a village already tense due to a past incident involving the desecration of a statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.By evening, mobs gathered and vandalised a bakery, torched a motorcycle, and damaged other properties. Police responded with teargas and a lathi charge to disperse the crowd. No injuries or casualties have been reported so far.Police confirmed the youth who posted the content was not a permanent resident of Yavat. He had been staying with his grandmother for some time after moving from Nanded.The authorities are investigating his motive and whether there are any links to previous provocations in the area.A First Information Report (FIR) has been registered and the youth is currently in police custody.In view of the unrest, Section 144 has been imposed in Yavat village for 48 hours to prevent gatherings and maintain peace. Heavy police deployment, including teams from the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF), has been put in place. Senior officers from Pune Rural police are stationed in the area, ANI reported.“We are appealing to all citizens not to believe in rumours. Strict action will be taken against those trying to disturb communal harmony,” said SP (Pune Rural) Pankaj Deshmukh.CM Devendra Fadnavis also issued a strong statement: “Some people are deliberately trying to disturb peace by posting offensive content. No one has the right to insult any religion or belief. We will not tolerate such acts and strict action will be taken.”Deputy CM Ajit Pawar said, “The government is closely monitoring the situation. Section 144 has been imposed and the police have acted promptly. I appeal to people to cooperate and maintain peace.”Police said the situation in Yavat had already been sensitive due to a recent speech by local representatives and past incidents involving insults to historical icons. The combination of old tensions and the latest post appears to have contributed to Friday’s unrest.Authorities continue to monitor the situation. Internet services have not been suspended yet, but officials say that may be considered if misinformation continues to spread.","An allegedly objectionable whatsapp post by a youth from another community sparked violence.

NEW DELHI: Union minister Kiren Rijiju on Friday ruled out any discussion in Parliament on the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar, asserting that the exercise falls entirely within the purview of the Election Commission of India (ECI), a constitutional body.“I want to clarify that the government is ready to hold discussions on any issue as per rules. There cannot be a discussion on SIR because it is a process undertaken by a Constitutional body, and it is not happening for the first time,” Rijiju told ANI.Parliament proceedings have faced repeated disruptions as Opposition MPs demanded a debate on the ongoing SIR exercise in poll-bound Bihar.

Citing former Lok Sabha Speaker Balram Jakhar, he said, “What is not favoured by rules and convention cannot be discussed.” He questioned who in the House would be authorised to respond on behalf of the ECI, adding, “This is not the first time the EC is doing it.”Opposition leaders have been unrelenting.Rahul Gandhi, speaking to reporters after meeting Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, accused the poll panel of acting on behalf of the BJP. “Whoever in the Election Commission is involved in this exercise, right from top to bottom, we will not spare you. You are working against India, and this is no less than treason,” he said.Congress and RJD leaders in Bihar have also criticised the draft rolls released by the ECI. According to PTI, more than 65 lakh enumeration forms were “not included” in the rolls, reducing the state’s total voters from 7.9 crore to 7.24 crore. Patna alone saw nearly 4 lakh such exclusions. The ECI attributed the drop to 22.34 lakh deaths, 36.28 lakh voters permanently shifting away, and 7.01 lakh duplicate registrations.Rijiju also criticised the Opposition for stalling Parliament. “Crores of rupees are spent on running Parliament. The Congress and its allies should apologise to people for their conduct,” he said. He claimed the disruptions prevent MPs from raising other pressing issues and violate parliamentary norms. PTI reported that the INDIA bloc intends to push for a debate again on Monday and at the Business Advisory Committee meeting.The ECI has opened a window for claims and objections till 1 September.

NEW DELHI: Faced with a troubling spike in student suicides, IIT Kharagpur is taking an unusual but decisive step, downsizing ceiling fans in hostel rooms to make them unusable for self-harm. The initiative is part of a larger mental health push aimed at protecting students from moments of impulsive distress.“This is not a solution to mental health, but in a moment of crisis, the absence of a tool can mean the presence of life,” said institute director Suman Chakraborty, speaking to PTI.The elite institute has witnessed four student suicides in 2024 alone, the latest being 21-year-old Ritam Mondal, a fourth-year mechanical engineering student, found dead in his hostel room on July 18, just days after returning from vacation.In response, IIT Kharagpur has formed a 10-member fact-finding committee and launched a slew of initiatives:The plan to replace ceiling fans in all 21 hostels, home to nearly 16,000 students, will roll out in phases. “We can’t give a timeline just yet, but the decision has been made,” Chakraborty said.By reducing access to means of suicide while strengthening emotional scaffolding, IIT Kharagpur is trying to change the script on campus tragedies, from silence and stigma to support and survival.","Iit kharagpur is downsizing ceiling fans in hostel rooms to make them unusable for self-harm.

NEW DELHI: More than 65 lakh names were left out of Bihar’s draft electoral rolls, according to the Election Commission (EC), following a month-long Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise. The EC said Patna alone accounts for the highest number of missing voters, with 3.95 lakh names not included, followed by East Champaran, Madhubani and Gopalganj with 3 lakh voters, news agency PTI reported.The new draft rolls were released on Friday, kicking off a process during which citizens can file claims and objections until 1 September.The EC said Bihar had 7.93 crore registered voters before the SIR began in June, but no final tally for the revised rolls has been disclosed. According to EC data, 7.23 crore voters submitted enumeration forms during the exercise. Around 35 lakh were found to have permanently migrated or were untraceable, 22 lakh were reported dead, and 7 lakh were registered in more than one constituency. Another 1.2 lakh voters didn’t submit forms at all.The process involved 77,895 polling centres across the state, supervised by 243 Electors Registration Officers and nearly 3,000 assistant EROs.More than 1.60 lakh booth-level agents and other volunteers were involved in the data-gathering operation, which required voters to return signed enumeration forms along with identity documents, either physically or online.The EC has not published a consolidated statewide list, but voters can verify their status on the official website. District magistrates have shared draft rolls with political party representatives in districts such as Supaul, Nawada, Darbhanga, and Jamui. Assembly elections in Bihar are due later this year.The SIR has drawn sharp criticism from opposition parties, who allege that the mass exclusions serve to benefit the ruling NDA. Petitions were filed in the Supreme Court, which remarked earlier this week that the exercise should result in “en masse inclusion and not en masse exclusion.”Meanwhile, Parliament witnessed heated scenes over the SIR issue. The Rajya Sabha was adjourned on Friday amid loud protests by opposition members demanding a discussion on the EC’s move. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh claimed a “paramilitary takeover” after security personnel reportedly blocked MPs from entering the well of the House. Deputy chairman Harivansh denied requests for discussion, citing that the matter is sub judice, which only intensified the standoff.","More than 65 lakh names were left out of bihar’s draft electoral rolls, according to the election commission.

Poll Should politicians accused of serious crimes be permanently barred from contesting elections? Yes, accountability is essential No, only after final conviction

NEW DELHI: More than a year after explicit videos allegedly featuring former MP Prajwal Revanna triggered a political storm ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, a special court in Bengaluru on Friday convicted him in one of the four rape cases registered against him.The special court for elected representatives, presided over by Judge Santosh Gajanan Bhat, found Revanna guilty in a case involving the rape of a domestic help at his family's Gannikada farmhouse in Holenarasipura, Hassan district.Revanna, who is the grandson of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda and a now-expelled JD(S) leader, broke down and was seen weeping in court after the verdict was announced, as per news agency ANI.Also read: Former PM Devegowda's grandson Prajwal Revanna convicted for raping domestic help The woman, then 48, alleged that she had been raped twice in 2021 and that the acts were recorded on his mobile phone. The quantum of punishment will be announced on Saturday.The case was originally registered at the Holenarasipura Rural Police Station. The verdict, initially due on July 30, had been delayed as the court sought clarification on technical matters. It was finally delivered on August 1.Prajwal Revanna is the prime accused in four separate criminal cases, all involving allegations of rape, sexual harassment, and criminal intimidation.The cases came to light in April 2024 after pen drives containing obscene video clips, allegedly involving Revanna, were circulated in Hassan. The scandal erupted just before the Lok Sabha elections, dealing a blow to Revanna’s political career—he lost the Hassan seat by over 40,000 votes.The Karnataka government had formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the allegations, and that Revanna was arrested on May 31, 2024 at Bengaluru airport after returning from Germany, where he had stayed for 35 days.In November 2024, the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal against the Karnataka high court’s rejection of both regular and anticipatory bail. “Dismissed,” said Justice Bela M. Trivedi, while Justice Satish Chandra Sharma added that there were several complaints against him. “You are so powerful,” the bench remarked when senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Revanna, argued that Section 376 (rape) was not cited in the original complaint.Also Read: Who is Prajwal Revanna?

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has rescued four women, who married four brothers, from the rigours of a more than two-decade old criminal case lodged against them by one of the brothers who was incensed by his father's decision to bequeath the properties to them fearing that the alcoholic son might fritter away the assets.Virtually endorsing the societal belief to entrust landed and residential properties to the women of the house to protect it from being pawned away by alcoholic male members, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan quashed the case accusing the women of forging the old man's will to usurp the property.One Ram Baksh Dubey, fearing his estate getting wasted by the alcoholic obsessions of his third son Ashish Kumar, executed an unregistered will on Dec 23, 1993, bequeathing all his moveable and immoveable properties in the name of his four daughters-in-law.Dubey died on Jan 3, 1994. Three months later Ashish executed a registered sale deed for his share in his father's property in favour of another person. Unaware of this sale, the four women applied for mutation of the land as per the will and revenue authority made necessary changes in the revenue records in Sept 1994.When the purchaser of Ashish's share started constructing on the land, the women approached the civil court, which restrained him. The purchaser's claim based on the sale deed was rejected. He then in league with Ashish filed a criminal complaint case in court accusing the women of creating a forged will.","Ram baksh dubey, fearing his estate getting wasted by the alcoholic obsessions of his third son ashish kumar, executed an unregistered will on dec 23, 1993.

The cabinet has allowed lottery operations, which were shut down in 1999. Burdened with a debt of over Rs 1 lakh crore, it hopes to make a modest Rs 50 crore to Rs 100 crore annually from sale of lottery tickets.The decision to reintroduce lotteries after over a quarter century was taken in a cabinet meeting on July 31. The recommendation came from a cabinet sub-committee set up to give suggestions to boost state revenue.The move seems to be inspired by other states that run lotteries. Neighbouring Punjab earned Rs 235 crore through sale of lottery tickets during the 2024-25 fiscal while the tiny state of Sikkim made Rs 30 crore. Kerala tops the list - the southern state earned a jaw-dropping Rs 13,582 crore last fiscal.
