‘Mahanagar stn was part of Metro plan but dropped later’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mahanagar-stn-was-part-of-metro-plan-but-dropped-later/articleshow/128622676.cms,"Lucknow: Did you know that the Mahanagar area of the city was part of the Metro route in the original alignment plan, but was dropped later? A comptroller and auditor general (CAG) report tabled in the state Assembly on Friday revealed that Mahanagar Metro Station, between IT College Crossing and Badshah Nagar, was mentioned in the DPR, but didn't make it to the final list.The CAG report states that in Dec 2013, the central govt had granted pre-approval for Phase-1A of the Lucknow Metro . The DPR, an MOU between the Centre and UP govt, the finance contract with the European investment bank (EIB), and the project agreement with EIB all specified the construction of 22 stations along the 23-km corridor.According to the DPR, Mahanagar station was projected to get the third-highest passenger footfall in 2015 and the second highest by 2020. A source in the Lucknow Municipal Corporation said the area has two separate wards (Mahanagar and Vivekananda Puri) with over one lakh population.However, the audit found that the executing company -- UP Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC) -- built only 21 stations, dropping Mahanagar from the alignment. No evidence was produced to show that any proposal for its exclusion was placed before the central or state govts nor any approval was obtained, the report says.The CAG noted that bypassing the sanctioned DPR violated multiple binding documents — DPR, MoU, finance contract, and the project agreement — and deprived the Mahanagar area of a key Metro facility despite projected high ridership.In Sept 2024, the state govt claimed that the change was not concealed, stating that the ministry of housing and urban affairs had notified the alignment with 21 stations after examining it against the original DPR.The CAG found state govt response unconvincing, noting that while the UPMRC informed MoHUA about other major alterations — such as changing the proposed elevated station at Chaudhary Charan Singh Airport to an underground one — it failed to disclose the removal of Mahanagar station. The audit stressed that any deviation from the approved DPR required a separate, explicit approval from the GoI along with justification, which was neither sought nor granted.Reacting to the CAG report, the UPMRC told TOI that station locations were optimised by dropping Mahanagar. It was appropriate to have both stations 'IT Chauraha' and 'Badshah Nagar' closer to Mahanagar. Usually 1km distance has been maintained between each station.","Mahanagar metro station was mentioned in the dpr, but didn't make it to the final list.

Bishnoi gang makes Rs10cr extortion call to Cong Akola MLA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bishnoi-gang-makes-rs10cr-extortion-call-to-cong-akola-mla/articleshow/128622329.cms,"Akola: Two back-to-back extortion threats, allegedly linked to Bishnoi gang, demanding Rs10 crore from Congress's Akola MLA and Rs2 crore from a BJP leader in Akot have put the law enforcement agencies on alert.Akola West Congress MLA Sajid Khan Pathan allegedly received extortion call demanding ₹10 crore from Bishnoi gang associate Shubham Lonkar, police said. Following the threat, the MLA's security has been enhanced. The development comes close on the heels of a separate case in which Akot BJP city president Harish Tawari was allegedly threatened through Signal messaging app.According to police, Tawari first received a message on Feb 12 asking him to arrange Rs2 crore by collecting it from Akot BJP MLA Prakash Bharsakale. Based on Tawari's complaint, a case has been registered with the cyber police station in Akola. Investigators have treated the message as a serious extortion threat and launched a probe.MLA Sajid Khan Pathan allegedly received a phone call demanding ₹10 crore. Police sources said the call was received on Feb 17 at around 3pm, and the caller allegedly warned the MLA to pay the amount within two days or face severe consequences.Investigators have traced the origin of the call to California, US.Following the threat, Pathan's security has been tightened and four armed police personnel have been deployed for his protection. After the call, the MLA met Akola superintendent of police Archit Chandak and other senior officers and formally lodged a complaint.Police said Lonkar is a native of Nevri Budruk village in Akot taluka of Akola district. The fact that a BJP city office-bearer and a Congress MLA were allegedly targeted by the same network has caused serious concern within the Akola police establishment.Who is Shubham Lonkar?According to police records, Lonkar had earlier claimed responsibility for the murder of NCP leader Baba Siddique, and later for the firing incident outside the residence of filmmaker Rohit Shetty.Lonkar had earlier been arrested by Akola police, who seized three pistols and live cartridges from his possession. Investigators believe he was in contact with gangster Lawrence Bishnoi and his younger brother Anmol Bishnoi.Police said Lonkar was a key operator in a weapons-trafficking racket. In the same case, Akot police had also arrested three persons who allegedly procured firearms through him.Investigators further said Lonkar had been living in Pune's Warje area for some time before going absconding. He was later arrested from Pune and subsequently released on bail.Police also claim to possess call recordings of conversations between Lonkar and Lawrence Bishnoi. Agencies believe Lonkar's network extends to Dubai and other international criminal links.

"For some Gujarat groups, parental consent for marriage written in ‘constitution’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-some-gujarat-groups-parental-consent-for-marriage-written-in-constitution/articleshow/128631922.cms,"A Patidar community meeting last month in Mehsana. Leader of a Patidar group said they want strict laws against ‘sham marriages’

'Violate ban, face boycott'

Notice

'Parents should have say'

'Love marriage no crime'

Gujarat govt’s proposal that couples must inform their parents before tying the knot is yet to become law, but ‘or - ders’ to that effect are al - ready in force in parts of Gujarat, where some villages and communities have come out with detailed ‘codes’ intended to govern how their members marry.The amendments proposed in the state assembly on Friday reflect de - mands and actions being pushed on the ground, with scattered village reso - lutions hardening into communitylevel ‘constitutions’ — resolutions and declarations that threaten couples who marry for love with boycott, ostracism, and exclusion from public life.From gram sabhas in Kheda district to caste organisations of Patidars and Thakors, the consen - sus driving such declarations is that marriage without parental consent threatens tradition, destabilises so - cial order and endangers women.The gram sabha in Nand village in Mahudha taluka recently passed a res - olution imposing total social boycott on couples who marry despite opposi - tion from their families. Such couples are barred from community facilities, religious gatherings and social func - tions. The resolution also caps wed - ding and funeral expenses, prohibits DJs and “objectionable songs”, and imposes fines for violations.Bharat Solanki, the village sar - panch, said rising cases of marriage disputes had led to the decision. “We are a village of 5,000, mostly Thakors and Darbars. There have been sagotra (intra-clan) marriages, which are not permissible. When a couple elopes, it puts parents in an embarrassing po - sition. As these incidents have been rising, we decided to declare a ban on such marriages. Violate the ban, and you face boycott. ”The rules, Solanki insisted, spare no one. All communities in the vil - lage — including OBC and SC fami - lies, which form a minority — are required to comply. “The rules are for everyone. We are not targeting one single group. Violators pay Rs 21,000 fine and are excluded from village gatherings,” he said.Similar ‘rules’ are surfacing else - where, signalling a broader social churn. Village elders argue that couples who elope — their union is known locally as ‘bhagedu lagan’ — disrupt social harmony and bring dishonour to their families.Geni Thakor, Congress MP from Banaskantha who spearheaded the Thakor community’s campaign against such unions, said “the deci - sion was taken because (they) kept seeing fraudulent marriages"".“A girl marrying outside her com - munity weakens its social fabric. There have been instances where women are deceived by men, subject - ed to abuse and, in some cases, driven to suicide. Our aim is to protect our daughters,” said Thakor, who also cit - ed demographic factors, saying “the Patidar sex ratio is collapsing”.Following the proposed amend -ments, Thakor said she “was the first to raise the issue of ‘bhagedu lagan’ when the ‘love jihad’ bill (Gujarat Free - dom of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2021) was tabled in the assembly”. She insisted that “99% of love marriages fail and bring misery to the girl”. Asked about the basis for her claim, she said, “I have found this in villages; it might not be the case in big cities.”Among Patidars, opposition to such self-choice marriages has simmered for years. Lalji Patel, who heads the Sardar Patel Group (SPG), said the movement crystallised around paren tal anguish.“During Covid, parents came to us, begging us to rescue daughters trapped in sham marriages,” Patel said. “That is why we initiated these measures.” He said the SPG has been demand - ing that the legal age of marriage for women be raised from 18 to 21 even as he acknowledged that the Constitution allows adults to marry by choice. “But society matters. Parents are every - thing. They should have a say.”One pamphlet distributed by the Patidar Sena in Mehsana went beyond parental consent to call for sweeping changes, including par - ents’ signatures on marriage regis - tration for those aged 30 or younger. It also wanted court marriages to be restricted to the bride’s local juris - diction, 40 to be the minimum age of witnesses, and couples who marry by choice after 30 to deposit Rs 10 lakh in their parents’ accounts and forfeit any claim to family property.“These demands are born from the pain parents have gone through,” said Satish Patel, leader of the Mehsana Patidar Sena. Asked about the proposed rules, he said they were “not fully satisfied” as they also wanted “only blood relatives of girls to be signatories in the marriage registration as that ensures both parents and relatives bear full accountability for every such union”.Community leaders backing these demands insist they are not against people choosing whom they want to marry, but against secrecy and deception. “If a couple wants to marry and the parents agree, we have no objection,"" Lalji Patel said. “But parents must be involved. They’re the ones who will always shield their daughters.” He, too, said the latest proposal falls short of their demands.“The govt speaks of merely ‘informing’ parents, as though a notification is sufficient. We have demanded that parents’ consent be made mandatory.”Legal experts warn that such meas - ures strike at the core of constitu - tional freedoms but those who fall foul of such diktats say that they have to face serious difficulties in their day-to-day lives.A Dalit man from northern Gujarat who married a woman from the Darbar community in 2015 — Darbars are placed higher in the social hierarchy—said they have had to change their residence at least 50 times and stay off social media to avoid being traced. Both hold postgraduate de - grees but cannot find stable work.“We’ve not been able to work at one place. We are dependent on daily wages even though we both hold PG degrees,” the man said. “We took up jobs with NGOs, but my wife’s family members or relatives traced me there during fieldwork.”Kaushik Parmar, a lawyer from Mehsana who works with intercaste couples, slammed the proposed changes in the marriage registration rules, saying that “love marriage is not the enemy of society; it is the right of a free citizen”. “Every attempt to curb it weakens the Constitution and strengthens caste hierarchies. If we truly want a progressive, equal, and just society, we must see love marriage not as a crime but as an instrument of social change. These rules amount to the murder of democracy,” he said.",Gujarat govt’s proposal that couples must inform their parents before tying the knot is yet to become law.

1 in 7 stroke patients in India under 45 years: National Registry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1-in-7-stroke-patients-in-india-under-45-years-national-registry/articleshow/128631939.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: One in seven stroke patients in India is younger than 45 years. Nearly two in five reach hospital more than 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. Three months later, more than half either die or suffer significant disability.These findings come from India’s largest hospital-based stroke registry analysis, published in ‘International Journal of Stroke’. The study was led by Prashant Mathur of ICMR–National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research (ICMR-NCDIR), Bengaluru, along with investigators of the National Stroke Registry Programme.The analysis reviewed 34,792 stroke cases recorded across 30 hospitals between 2020 and 2022, providing one of the most detailed national snapshots of stroke patterns, treatment gaps and outcomes.The mean age of patients was 59.4 years, but 13.8% were under 45, underlining the growing burden of stroke among younger Indians. Nearly 63.4% were men and 72.1% came from rural areas, reflecting disparities in awareness, prevention and access to timely care.Hypertension was present in 74.5% of patients, making it the dominant risk factor. Diabetes affected 27.3%, smokeless tobacco use 28.5%, tobacco smoking 22.6% and alcohol use 20.2%.The study also noted gender differences — women had higher rates of hypertension and diabetes, while men reported greater tobacco and alcohol use.The time taken to get treatment remained the biggest hurdle, according to the analysis. Only 20% reached hospital within the crucial 4.5-hour window for emergency stroke treatment. In contrast, 37.8% reached hospital after 24 hours. As a result, just 4.6% of ischemic stroke patients received intravenous thrombolysis and 0.7% underwent mechanical thrombectomy, it said. Delayed arrival, imaging delays and non-availability of medicines were key reasons for missing treatment.Ischemic strokes accounted for 60% of cases, while intracerebral haemorrhage made up 34.2%.Dr Manjari Tripathi, head of neurology at AIIMS Delhi, said the numbers reinforced a basic message. “Patients must reach the hospital within three hours. Immediate brain imaging is essential, and, if eligible, thrombolysis should be given without delay. Time is brain — every minute lost means neurons lost, leading to disability and long-term dependence. It is vital that people recognise stroke symptoms and seek emergency care early,” she said.Outcomes remain stark as in-hospital mortality was 13.9%, but by three months, nearly 28% had died, indicating that many patients passed away after discharge. In total, more than half had a poor outcome, defined as death or significant disability. Women were more likely than men to have a disability at follow-up, suggesting possible gaps in rehabilitation and post-discharge care. Recurrent stroke within three months occurred in 1.1% of patients.The authors said stronger control of hypertension and diabetes, tobacco cessation, faster referral systems and better access to acute stroke care — particularly in rural India — were critical. Without improvements in prevention and rapid response, stroke would continue to strike early and leave families coping with avoidable disability.","One in seven stroke patients in india is younger than 45 years.

BENGALURU: Haunted by morbid thoughts of who would take care of his wife upon his death, a former Isro staffer, 76, allegedly strangled his wife to death on Wednesday morning, contemplated ending his life by suicide, but panicked and aborted the plan.Police officers probing the case said Nageshwar Rao, who retired as a team leader, is under treatment for unstated psychological issues. The incident took place in a senior living community in Bengaluru's Whitefield area, a first such case in many years.According to preliminary investigations, Rao used a bath towel to smother Sandhya Shri, 63, while she was preparing lunch in the kitchen around 10.15am in The Virtuoso in Bommenahalli. Rao has been arrested on charges of murder.The couple from Andhra Pradesh purchased the flat three years ago. Their only daughter is settled in the US. Informed by police, the daughter is flying to Bengaluru, sources said.""After the woman collapsed, Rao sat near her body for 20 minutes. He called a neighbour, asking him to come home immediately as he had killed his wife. The neighbour thought it was a joke. When Rao repeatedly said it, the neighbour rushed in,"" police said.Seeing Sandhya motionless on the floor, the neighbour called a doctor in the apartment. Since many senior citizens live in the apartment, an ambulance and a doctor are deployed round the clock.""The doctor examined Sandhya and declared her dead. Then, the doctor called police,"" an investigating officer said.When police entered the flat, Rao was sitting on the sofa and readily confessed to the incident. ""Yes, I killed her. I may not live more than 3-4 years from now. Who'll look after her after my death? We don't have close relatives in Bengaluru,"" he said.However, when a senior police officer questioned him about the motive, Rao answered the query with a blank stare.The incident has jolted police and geriatric caregivers. A cop said: ""This shocking episode comes at a time when community-living residences for senior citizens are gaining popularity in Bengaluru.""","Nageshwar rao, 76, allegedly strangled his wife to death on wednesday morning.

‘Chasing shadow in room of mirrors’: Why Delhi Police can’t crack the school bomb threat puzzle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/chasing-shadow-in-room-of-mirrors-why-bomb-hoax-probes-hit-dead-end/articleshow/128571891.cms,"Blame It On Ironclad Privacy Of Swiss Servers, Geopolitical Opacity Of Foreign Domains, VPN Shields

AI Impact Summit, Supreme Court on CAA, India-France Ties & More





NEW DELHI: After some south Delhi schools received bomb hoaxes earlier this month, a technical probe led police to a virtual private network (VPN) service in Bangladesh. Days later, a spate of similar threats in northwest Delhi led them to a US-based VPN, while hoaxes reported in west Delhi schools a few months ago involved a Singapore-based VPN. However, even as police were busy writing to these networks to gather user details, they were flooded with more hoaxes.So, why is the law enforcement seemingly helpless in curbing this menace?When a threatening email lands in the inbox of a school in the city, the tactical response in the form of blaring sirens, evacuation of students and deployment of sniffer dogs and cops on the campuses is loud and swift.However, in tech dens of the police cyber cell, the reaction is quieter and the fightback uphill and borderline demoralising. For Delhi's cyber-investigators, each hoax call represents a forensic dead end.Despite a string of such high-profile scares stretching into early 2026, the perpetrators remain digital ghosts. The inability to crack these cases isn't due to a lack of manpower, but owing to unsurmountable technical hurdles: the ironclad privacy of Swiss servers, geopolitical opacity of foreign domains and multi-layered shields of VPNs.When investigators attempt to ‘ping' the origin of a threat, they aren't led to a desktop in Delhi, but to a server in a jurisdiction like Panama or the Seychelles. Using VPN chains — routing a connection through multiple encrypted tunnels — the perpetrator ensures that the IP address visible to Delhi Police is a dummy.""The hoaxers hide their actual location in Delhi or elsewhere behind a series of encrypted ‘tunnels'. The IP address that police see may belong to a server in Austria, Singapore or Netherlands. To us, it is like chasing a shadow in a room full of mirrors; every time we think we have a lead, the trail bounces to another country,"" said a cyber cell investigator.To get a real IP, police must request logs from a VPN provider. However, most premium services used by these actors operate on a strict no-log policy, meaning they do not store records of who use their services at a specific time. Simply put, there's no data to be handed over to the cops. So, the trail doesn't just go cold, it ceases to exist in the physical world.This wall of anonymity is reinforced by the choice of platform. In several high-profile waves of bomb threats, including the massive surge in hoaxes in May 2024 and the recent cases this month, the senders utilised Switzerland-based ProtonMail. Known for its militant commitment to privacy, ProtonMail uses end-to-end encryption, which even it can't bypass, and does not require a phone number or personal details to create an account. From an investigative standpoint, this is a nightmare.Because the service is protected by Swiss privacy laws, Delhi Police can't issue a standard search warrant. It must navigate the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty — a diplomatic marathon that requires proving ‘double criminality' (that the act is a crime in both India and Switzerland). Even then, the most police may receive is basic metadata — like the time of the creation of an account — which is rarely enough to identify a sophisticated user who had signed up using a masked identity.The ‘Russian angle' adds a final layer of complexity. Many hoax emails carry an ‘.ru' suffix, often from services like mail.ru. Investigators frequently find that these domains are used as a tactical smokescreen.By the time a request for information moves through the bureaucratic channels of Interpol, the specific account is usually deleted and the logs are overwritten.Occasionally, police do catch a break — usually when a ‘copycat' or a student makes a fundamental error in operational security, such as forgetting to turn on the VPN or using a personal recovery email. In late 2024, a student in Delhi was apprehended after sending a threat to his own school to avoid taking an an exam. He had forgotten to turn on his VPN, leaving his home IP address exposed.However, for the professional operators who target dozens of schools simultaneously, the global digital architecture is their greatest ally. The sheer volume of schools targeted — sometimes over 100 in a single morning — suggests a level of planning that involves scraping school databases from the dark web or using automated crawlers.So, as long as this infrastructure allows for perfect anonymity, all Delhi Police can do is operate within a reactive loop: evacuate students, search bags and declare hoaxes, while those behind the screen remain digital phantoms.","Blame it on ironclad privacy of swiss servers, geopolitical opacity of foreign domains, vpn shields.

RAIPUR: A puff of cigarette nearly turned into a fireball at Chhattisgarh's Raipur petrol pump after a youth allegedly set a fuel nozzle ablaze using a lighter when asked not to smoke, that triggered flames on a motorcycle and pump.

'Inform parents': Gujarat may tweak marriage norms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/inform-parents-gujarat-may-tweak-marriage-norms/articleshow/128627801.cms,"Gujarat deputy CM Harsh Sanghavi, who has itnroduced the proposal

GANDHINAGAR: The BJP govt in Gujarat has proposed 'anti-love jihad' amendments to marriage registration rules that would require couples to inform their parents before registering their union - a move welcomed by AAP, met with silence by the Congress and flagged by legal experts as a potential constitutional violation.Under the draft rules introduced in the assembly Friday, couples seeking to register their marriage will have to submit an undertaking stating whether they have informed their parents. The assistant registrar will notify the parents of both bride and groom electronically, including over WhatsApp, or through physical communication.Registration will be granted within 30 days after verification, with all submitted details uploaded to a govt portal.Deputy CM Harsh Sanghavi, who introduced the proposed changes, said the govt had nothing against ""love marriage"" but couldn't allow deception in the name of mutual consent. ""Innocent girls are being trapped and such practices are spreading like termites in society. Salim masquerading as Suresh will not be allowed,"" he said.Citing instances from Panchmahal district, Sanghavi said investigations were ordered after nikaah certificates were allegedly issued in villages where there was no mosque or even a single Muslim family.In villages such as Kankodakui and Nathkuva, hundreds of such certificates were allegedly issued by talati-cum-mantris (village panchayat secretaries), Sanghavi said.In the assembly, AAP legislator Hemant Ahir, who had moved a private member's bill on similar lines earlier in the week, congratulated the govt on tabling the proposed amendments. ""Changes in the rules were the need of the hour. There were several loopholes in the rules,"" he said.BJP MLA Lavingji Thakor, a strong proponent of stricter norms, said the move would benefit families of all communities. Congress stayed mum.Several community organisations, including those representing the Patidar and Kshatriya Thakor groups, have long pressed for mandatory parental involvement in love marriages. Over the past three months, as many as 30 meetings were held between the state govt and representatives of various organisations to finalise the changes.Legal experts said the proposal might not stand judicial scrutiny. ""This infringes upon the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution,"" said advocate Mahesh Baria. Fellow advocate Nilesh Bhavsar said while the govt had described the measure as mere intimation, parental objections could potentially influence registration decisions, leading to litigation.","Gujarat govt proposes amendments to marriage registration rules.

New Delhi: A six-year-old girl went missing in 2018. She was last seen with her stepfather. When he was arrested eight days later, he led police to the place where her charred remains were found. Supreme Court found this evidence weak and acquitted him of the murder charge.Finding no other evidence to link the man to the murder except that he was the last person to be seen with the child according to a neighbour and he was the one to lead the police to the victim's bones, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and K Vinod Chandran acquitted him, saying the investigation was botched and left many questions unanswered. ""In the present case, the murder of a six-year-old girl went unpunished and her stepfather was incarcerated on mere conjecture,"" SC said.In the case from Chhattisgarh, what tilted the scales towards the stepfather, Rohit Jangde, was the peculiarity of the interpretation by SC in earlier judgments on the admissibility of a statement by an accused that leads to discovery of fact relating to the crime - in this case, the recovery of the girl's body.More than 65 years ago, SC had ruled that the statement of an accused leading to discovery of facts relating to the crime would be admissible evidence only when it had been made in custody.Justices Kumar and Chandran also relied on a similar interpretation used in a nearly 100-year-old ruling by Calcutta HC.Interestingly in the 1931 judgment, the then CJ of Calcutta HC had expressed anguish that the law permitted reliance on a statement made to police that led to discovery of fact only when the person was in police custody and had termed it absurd, but left it to the legislature to make suitable amends. Relying on these decades-old judgments, SC termed weak the telltale evidence incriminating Jangde.Justice Chandran said even if the evidence was accepted, it would not by itself nail the guilt on the stepfather. ""The knowledge of the accused, which led to the detection of the bone remnants though not acceptable under Section 27 would all the same be acceptable evidence under Section 8, which by itself is a weak piece of evidence. The evidence under Section 8 can only offer corroboration and cannot by itself result in a conviction,"" he said.Acquitting the accused, the bench said, ""The long gap when there was no complaint made about the missing child and the factum of none having questioned the accused, despite the family and police having been told that she went with the accused, tilts the scales in favour of the accused... Pertinent also is that since the corpus delicti was not recovered, there is no time of death specified. We are hence unable to uphold the conviction of the accused, and he has to be necessarily given the benefit of doubt. ""","A six-year-old girl went missing in 2018.

Mamata Banerjee vs Election Commission: Supreme Court Orders Judicial Oversight in Bengal SIR

New Delhi: The Union home ministry on Friday constituted a second empowered committee for West Bengal to fast-track the processing of citizenship requests received under Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA).CAA provides for grant of citizenship to immigra-nts from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh belonging to their six minority faiths - Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist, Jain and Parsi - who entered India before Dec 31, 2014, fearing religious persecution in their home countries.In a gazette notification issued on Friday, the home ministry said West Bengal's new empowered committee - which takes the final call on citizenship applications forwarded by the district-level committee after verification of documents - shall be headed by the deputy registrar general, directorate of census operations of the state.The original empowered committee - set up in accordance with a notification issued by MHA in March 2024 and headed by director, census operations of West Bengal - will continue to be in existence. The new empowered committee, central govt sources told TOI, has been set up as the volume of applications under CAA in the state has increased. Sharing of work is expected to compress the processing time.West Bengal has a significant number of Hindu immigrants, such as those belonging to the Matua community.BJP has been making a major outreach to them to strengthen its electoral prospects in the state.The new empowered committee on CAA allows certain members of the empowered committee as notified on March 11, 2024 - like the jurisdictional foreigners regional registration officer and state informatics officer - to nominate an officer each, not below the rank of under secretary. Other members like an officer of the subsidiary intelligence bureau and postmaster general or a postal officer nominated by him remain the same.Like the original empowered committee, the new panel shall include a representative from the office of West Bengal principal secretary (home) or additional chief secretary (home) and a representative of the jurisdictional divisional railway manager as invitees.","The union home ministry on friday constituted a second empowered committee for west bengal to fast-track the processing of citizenship requests.

BJP Targets Rahul Gandhi Over AI Summit Protest Row

NEW DELHI: The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) youth wing on Friday staged a protest outside Congress leader Rahul Gandhi 's Delhi house, hours after the members from the rival camp tricked their way into Bharat Mandapam and tried to disrupt the government's ambitious ongoing AI summit.The incident opened a new front of contention between the political nemeses, with the BJP accusing the Congress of tarnishing the nation's reputation.Calling Rahul Gandhi a ""traitor,"" a protesting BJP Yuva Morcha leader, who was being bundled into a van, said, ""This shows their ideology against the country.

They have protested against their own country.""""The way Rahul Gandhi and the Congress Party tarnished India's reputation by storming the AI Summit...Rahul Gandhi continues to try to tarnish India's reputation on the international stage.

A week after the municipal election results were declared, an unusual post-poll drama is unfolding across several towns in Telangana.

Some videos showing some of the defeated candidates or their relatives asking for refunds have gone viral on social media, fuelling public outrage.Reports of clashes between candidates and residents have surfaced from Medchal Malkajgiri, Khammam, Suryapet, Peddapalli, Bhadradri Kothagudem, Jagtial and Nizamabad districts. In several instances, residents said they never demanded the money or gifts given voluntarily, and it was not correct for these to be returned.On the eve of the Feb 10 polling, candidates in some municipalities and wards allegedly distributed cash between Rs 2,500 and Rs 3,000 for each vote.

Mumbai: A tussle is brewing within the MVA over the selection of a candidate for the lone Rajya Sabha seat which the alliance can win in the upcoming RS polls. While Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut had revealed that NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar was keen on contesting, Aaditya Thackeray claimed the seat for the UBT Sena. Now the Congress has said that either one Rajya Sabha or MLC seat should come to it.""Since we have the second highest number of MLAs in the alliance, the Congress should get either a Rajya Sabha or MLC seat,"" said Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe on Friday.Sanjay Raut struck a conciliatory note on Friday, saying three parties in the alliance will sit together and take a decision on the candidate. ""We have enough numbers for one Rajya Sabha seat. The three parties will sit down and decide who is the best candidate for the interests and identity of Maharashtra. The decision will be taken unanimously,"" Raut said. The election is slated for March 16.When asked about NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar's possible candidature since his term is ending, Raut said, ""Sharad Pawar is a big leader of this country."" He added, ""Each party feels it is an important constituent and will seek opportunities.But finally, there is consensus.""Raut said it was important to send a Marathi-speaking candidate to the Rajya Sabha. ""We need to send a Marathi-speaking candidate to the Rajya Sabha who will raise issues in the interest of Maharashtra,"" he said.The question of a joint candidate within the MVA assumes significance in view of the speculation on talks of a merger between the NCP (SP), which is part of the MVA, and the NCP led by the late Ajit Pawar which is part of the ruling Mahayuti alliance. The MVA needs 37 votes to win a Rajya Sabha seat. It has 47 MLAs.
