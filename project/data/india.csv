NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu ’s ruling party, the DMK , once again raised objections to the use of Hindi in non-Hindi regions. DMK leader and MP Kanimozhi flagged what she termed the “imposition” of Hindi after responding to a post that showed Hindi being prominently used on Chennai Park railway station signboard.Taking to social media platform X, Kanimozhi appeared to target the BJP-led Centre, which the DMK has often accused of promoting Hindi at the expense of regional languages.In her post, written in Tamil, she said, loosely translated: “It began in Kallakurichi and continues to Chennai Poonthottam. They will not stop imposing it. Nor will we cease resisting it.”The BJP-led central government and the DMK government in Tamil Nadu have long been at odds over the language issue, with chief minister MK Stalin and his party repeatedly opposing what they describe as the imposition of Hindi from the North and with the support of Centre.Language politics is expected to play a key role in shaping electoral prospects in Tamil Nadu, which is heading for assembly elections to its 234-seat legislature.

New Delhi: NHAI has refunded toll charges in 17.7 lakh cases between Jan and Dec 2025 for incorrect deductions and in nearly 35% of these cases, the vehicles were not at the toll plaza when the user fee was debited from FASTag wallet.Considering that such transactions happen due to manual entry of vehicle details by toll operators because of some issue, the road transport ministry is mulling doing away with this option completely.In a written reply, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari informed the Lok Sabha Thursday that National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI), which provides the Central Clearing House (CCH) services of electronic toll collection , ""has reported 17.6 lakh transactions where refunds were made due to incorrect user fee (toll) deductions from Jan-2025 to Dec-2025 out of a total of 464 crore FASTag transactions"".This is barely 0.03% of all FASTag transactions.An official said, ""Though the number of faulty transactions is miniscule, this shouldn't happen.

In such cases, there is a possibility of the toll attendants noting down wrong details. This becomes an unnecessary hassle for commuters.""The ministry said that with the implementation of FASTag, the average time taken to cross toll plaza has reduced to 40 seconds compared with the earlier 12.2 minutes per vehicle under the manual tolling system.In a separate written reply to a question on the total toll collection, the road transport ministry said in the past three quarters of the financial year 2025-26, Rs 50,195 crore was collected as user fee across the national highway and expressway network.During the entire last financial year, Rs 61,508 crore was collected as toll, the ministry further said.","Nhai has refunded toll charges in 17.7 lakh cases between jan and dec 2025.

‘Vote Theft In Bengal’: TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee Slams ECI Over SIR, BJP Fires Back

New Delhi: Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Election Commission to implement in Tamil Nadu the court directed procedure for submission of documents by voters flagged under ‘logical discrepancy’ category during Special Intensive Revision of West Bengal electoral rolls, prompting the EC to request the SC to extend it to all states undergoing SIR of voter lists.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi, dealing with petitions by politicians from ruling DMK party, said the names of voters categorised under ‘logical discrepancies’ by EC would be displayed at public places, panchayat and taluk offices along with the reasons for such categorisation and documents required to be furnished by them.“The person receiving the documents from voters would issue a receipt. However, hearing of voters for inclusion of their names in electoral rolls would be conducted at taluka level officers,” the bench said and directed the TN govt to provide adequate staff to the EC to carry out the task. It allowed the voters to submit the documents within 10 days of display of the list by EC.It also asked the DGP, SPs and collectors to ensure no law and order situation emerges to scuttle the SIR exercise. This prompted EC counsel and senior advocate D S Naidu to request the SC to extend the order to all states where SIR of electoral rolls are being carried out.In its order, the bench recorded - “We expect the EC to comply with these directions on a pan-India basis.”In another hearing, the CJI-led bench concluded hearing on the challenge to the constitutional validity of SIR, which was first carried out in Bihar and then extended to 12 other states, after a three month long hearing that saw contrasting arguments put forth by the poll body and petitioners.Appearing for Association for Democratic Reforms, advocate Prashant Bhushan said EC cannot remove a person from the voter list if he/she gives a self-declaration claiming to be an Indian citizen.He said if anyone objects to the citizenship of a voter, then the onus is on the complainant to produce the voter list from Bangladesh to substantiate the accusation of illegal migrants. The bench laughed and said, “You know this is not possible. How will someone get the voter list from Bangladesh containing the name of an alleged illegal migrant figuring in the voter list of an Indian state.”",Supreme court on thursday asked the election commission to implement in tamil nadu the court directed procedure for submission of documents by voters flagged under ‘logical discrepancy’ category during special intensive revision of west bengal electoral rolls.

Sibal said that these malicious and misleading statements, which he never said and debunked by fact checkers, were relied upon. The activist was detained in Sept and he has been in custody since then.Highlighting Wangchuk has been holding protests to protect ecology and environment of Ladakh, Sibal said speaking against a govt cannot be termed as an act against the country and anti-national. ""He had said he will not allow violence to take place. The 6th schedule was a promise given by a political party. It was given in 2020. If in 2025 he says fulfil it before elections then what's wrong with it? Anti-govt sentiment is not a security threat to the country.I can criticise the govt. That's what democracy is about. And part of that is peaceful protests, marches and criticising the govt,,"" he said.Reading from the transcript of his speech and interviews, Sibal put all these statements to establish that ""some IT cell"" took a small clip and put it in a different context to spark the controversy. ""A detaining authority relying on a statement must rely on the entire statement and cannot rely on a sentence or two...The whole detention order is based on excerpts, out of context, misleading, false, thereby suggesting a selective approach, malafide in nature, to ensure that I am detained,"" Sibal said.Referring to his alleged statement to overthrow the govt, Sibal made the bench to go through the transcript .""The correct translation is - I say if the govt does not have affection for citizens, care for its environment, then such a govt is an obstacle in the progress of the nation. He says I too can bring change. We all need to be prepared to save mother Ladakh and mother India. What is wrong in this?"" he said.On disrespecting a goddess, Sibal said, ""The unedited version brings out a complete picture. It was meant to say that after liberating Ladakh from Kashmir, the central govt failed to extend its promise of constitutional safeguards under the 6th Schedule. He says like Rama got Sita from the clutches of Ravana and left her in the market, the central govt did a similar thing with Ladakh."" He said that the activist had praised govt and Prime Minister Narendra Modi multiple times on international platforms and he never spoke against the country.

to replace Ajit Pawar in Maharashtra cabinet?

Who will lead the party?

NEW DELHI: The sudden death of Ajit Pawar has left his party, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), with many challenges. After losing its most skilful political manager, the party is now in a Catch-22 situation over a possible merger with the rival faction, while also keeping the alliance with the BJP intact.As “Ajit Dada” was cremated in Baramati on Thursday after a tragic plane crash, four questions are staring straight at the party.Amid the ongoing speculations, the Pawar family has to take a call over the merger of the party, which underwent a split in 2023. According to senior NCP leader and a minister in the Fadnavis cabinet, Narhari Zirwal said that the “two factions are already together”, claiming that there was “no point in remaining scattered.”“The two factions are already together (for local body polls). Everyone has realised that there is no point in remaining scattered and we have to be together,"" Zirwal said.Meanwhile, state NCP (Sharad Pawar) president Shashikant Shinde told news agency PTI that Ajit Pawar, before his death, Ajit had spoke about sitting together and taking a decision on the merger of the two NCPs after municipal and local body polls in Maharashtra.“When we had met for an alliance of the two parties for Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad corporation elections (which took place on January 15), he (Ajit) had said let’s sit together and discuss (merger) after Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti polls (scheduled on February 5),” he said.“Ajit Dada (elder brother) was an emotional man and wanted the two factions to come together and the (Pawar) family to remain united. He had felt enough was enough. If the family and parties want a reconciliation, we have no problem. Now, we have to see if we can fulfil what became his last wish,” he added.This comes after both the factions contested the local body polls in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad together.However, the united Nationalist Congress Party suffered a massive setback in Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune municipal elections. In the 165-member Pune Municipal Corporation, the NCP won only 27 seats and NCP (SP) three seats against the BJP’s tally of 119, whereas in the 102-member Pimpri-Chinchwad civic body, Ajit Pawar’s party got 37 and Sharad Pawar’s faction drew a blank, while the BJP got 84 seats.In 2023, Ajit Pawar, along with a group of senior leaders, parted ways with Sharad Pawar and joined hands with the BJP and Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena. He had raised objections over Sharad Pawar continuing to lead the party, despite his old age.Ajit was sworn in as deputy chief minister under this new alliance. The Election Commission later recognised Ajit’s faction as the legitimate NCP, retaining the ‘clock’ symbol.After the merger, the united NCP will also have to take a call on whether to continue to stay in the Mahayuti alliance or step out and join the opposition.According to political analysts, if NCP (SP)’s working president Supriya Sule takes a call to join the opposition, several NCP MLAs could oppose the move and switch to Shiv Sena or the BJP.However, if the party decides to stay in the alliance with the BJP and Shiv Sena, those with Sharad Pawar’s group in the opposition will not want their group to compromise on Phule-Ambedkar-Shahu’s ideology.NCP leaders are also pushing Sunetra Pawar — wife of Ajit Pawar — as his replacement in the Fadnavis cabinet. Narhari Zirwal said it is the people’s wish that late Ajit Pawar’s wife Sunetra, a Rajya Sabha member, be inducted into the state ministry.Asked about the NCP’s future after the untimely death of Ajit Pawar, who was also the party president, Zirwal said that people want “vahini” (sister-in-law, referring to Sunetra Pawar) to be made a cabinet member.“We will talk to our leadership about it (inducting Sunetra in the cabinet) and take a decision,” Zirwal, a close confidante of Ajit Pawar, said.Given that Sunetra hasn’t been politically active despite being a Rajya Sabha MP, it will be interesting to see whether she will be allotted a seat in the Maharashtra cabinet. And even if she is given a seat in the cabinet, will she be made deputy chief minister or finance minister of the state — the posts Ajit Pawar held?In a situation where the merger plan fails, another question arises over who will become the president of the party. While former Union minister and party working president Praful Patel and state unit chief Sunil Tatkare are likely contenders, the Pawars would be reluctant to let someone from outside the family lead the party.Another NCP leader and Ajit Pawar confidante, Pramod Hindurao, maintained that Sunetra Pawar should carry forward the legacy of her husband and take care of party workers.“Considering the sympathy factor, Sunetra can be the option to not only lead the party but also negotiate merger talks with the other group, who are also part of her family,” political analyst Prakash Pawar told TOI.","Ajit dada was cremated in baramati on thursday after a tragic plane crash.

Supreme Court Halts New UGC Equity Regulations On Caste Definition, Seeks Centre’s Reply By March

New Delhi: Supreme Court on Thursday put on hold the controversial UGC (Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions) Regulations, 2026, taking serious exception to several of its provisions and saying that these could fuel societal division and have a dangerous impact on the goal of a casteless society.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi heard three petitions and said that while implementation of the 2026 regulations would be on hold till further orders, the 2012 regulations would continue to be in force to address grievances relating to caste-based discrimination against students on campuses of educational institutions.""We are sorry to say, the Regulations, prima facie, the language is completely vague, the provisions are capable of being misused, and the language needs to be re-modulated and redesigned,"" the bench said and asked for the setting up of an experts panel to examine the regulations.Terming the new regulations as regressive, the CJI said, ""In the country, after 75 years, whatever we have gained to move towards the goal of casteless society, are we enacting a regressive policy? No doubt, there has to be some effective mechanism to deal with caste-based discrimination.""The justices said that while they were all for regulations for creation of ""a free, inclusive and an equitable atmosphere in Universities....there are four or five serious concerns about the Regulations. If those are not addressed, the Regulations will otherwise have sweeping consequences that will divide society and lead to many dangerous impacts on the country.""The CJI flagged another provision in the regulations as problematic, pointing out that it proposed separate hostels based on the caste of students. ""For God's sake, please do not do that. In hostels, students from every community live together. There are inter-caste marriages also. We should move towards a casteless society by assimilating students of all regions and (students of) all castes must have equal rights and live harmoniously in universities. We cannot go backwards. There must not be any segregation.""The hearing took place amid agitation by sections of upper caste students against the regulations for allegedly being discriminatory and exclusionary and for being oblivious to the changed socio-economic milieu where newly empowered OBCs have also been accused of discriminating against others, including those from upper castes.Significantly, the OBCs are not under the purview of the 2012 regulations which snap back in action after the SC's order on Thursday.Leading the arguments for petitioners, advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain said the Regulations presume that only a certain category of students belonging to certain castes face discrimination in universities. They keep general category candidates outside their purview, leaving such students without remedies for discrimination faced by them.Asking Centre and UGC to respond to the petitions by March 19, the bench said, ""We want to examine the constitutional validity and legality of 2026 Regulations. We would like the Union govt, with the concurrence and approval of the court, to constitute a panel of experts comprising eminent academicians and scholars who understand our social conditions to study the regulations and its possible impacts.""The regulations deal only with caste-based discrimination and presume that India is divided on basis of caste and do not deal with issues like ragging, North-South divide, cultural diversity, which too lead to discrimination, the petitioners said.The CJI Kant-led bench said, ""Ragging is the worst thing that happens on campuses. Children coming from south India to north India and vice-versa, and from north-east to other states of the country, carry their cultural values with them.""","Supreme court halts new ugc equity regulations on caste definition, seeks centre’s reply by march 19. Chief justice surya kant and justice joymalya bagchi heard three petitions. While implementation of the 2026 regulations would be on hold till further orders.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127785217,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-42646,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

On Wednesday, the museum announced it will return three sculptures to India after rigorous research revealed the sculptures had been removed illegally from temples in Tamil Nadu The sculptures 'Shiva Nataraja' (Chola period, ca. 990), 'Somaskanda' (Chola period, 12th century) and 'Saint Sundarar with Paravai' (Vijayanagar period, 16th century) are examples of the rich artistry of South Indian bronze casting.The Indian govt has agreed to place the 'Shiva Nataraja' on long-term loan. This arrangement will allow the museum to publicly share the full story of the object's origins, removal and return. It will be on view as part of the exhibition 'The Art of Knowing in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Himalayas.'As part of a systematic review of its South Asian collections, the National Museum of Asian Art undertook a detailed investigation into the provenance of the three sculptures, scrutinizing each work's transaction history.In 2023, in collaboration with the Photo Archives of the French Institute of Pondicherry, museum researchers confirmed that the bronzes had been photographed in temples in Tamil Nadu between 1956 and 1959. The Archaeological Survey of India subsequently reviewed these findings and affirmed the sculptures had been removed in violation of Indian laws.""The National Museum of Asian Art is committed to stewarding cultural heritage responsibly and advancing transparency in our collection,"" said museum director Chase F Robinson.The Shiva Nataraja belonged to the Sri Bhava Aushadesvara Temple in Thanjavur district, where it was photographed in 1957. The bronze was later acquired by the National Museum of Asian Art from Doris Wiener Gallery in New York in 2002. A researcher at the museum determined that the Doris Wiener Gallery had provided falsified documentation to facilitate the sale to the museum. The Somaskanda and Saint Sundarar with Paravai was part of a gift of 1,000 objects. Research showed that it was from the Visvanatha Temple in Alattur village, Mannarkudi taluk, and the Saint Sundarar with Paravai at the Shiva Temple was from Veerasolapuram village, Kallakuruchchi taluk.","Sculptures 'shiva nataraja' and 'somaskanda' removed illegally from temples in tamil nadu.

NEW DELHI: Supriya Sule , MP and cousin of Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, broke down in tears on Wednesday as she met family members in Baramati after the NCP leader's death in a plane crash.Visuals from the Pawar family's Baramati home showed Sule and wife Sunetra overwhelmed with emotion as they consoled relatives following their arrival from Delhi. Sharad Pawar also arrived in Baramati shortly.Ajit Pawar (66), a six-time deputy chief minister and one of Maharashtra's most influential leaders, was killed along with others when his chartered aircraft, which was attempting to land, crashed near Baramati airport on Wednesday morning.Pawar was travelling from Mumbai to Baramati, Sule’s parliamentary constituency and the Pawar family’s political stronghold, to address four rallies for the February 5 zilla parishad elections. The crash occurred around 8.50 am, officials said.Sule cried inconsolably for her 'dada' as condolences poured in from across the political spectrum.The grief in Baramati stood in sharp contrast to the political rupture witnessed within the family in 2023, when Ajit Pawar led a major split in the NCP and walked away from NCP founder and patriarch Sharad Pawar, joining the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance government.The split turned Maharashtra's first family of cooperative-era politics into a public spectacle and set the stage for a bitter contest between the two NCP factions: one led by Sharad Pawar and the other by Ajit Pawar.At the time, critics had suggested the rift was also linked to shifting succession dynamics within the party, pointing to the rise of Sule, Sharad Pawar’s daughter and the national face of the organisation, as a key factor.Despite the open political conflict, Sule repeatedly maintained that there were no personal differences with Ajit Pawar.""Relationships shouldn’t come in between politics,"" she had said, asserting that the contest was ideological, not personal.However, the bitterness of the split spilled into Parliament in September 2023, when Sule, while speaking on the Nari Shakti Vandan ordinance in Lok Sabha, took a pointed jibe that was widely interpreted as being aimed at her cousin.""Not every house has a brother who likes the sister's well-being,"" she had said, responding to Union home minister Amit Shah's remarks that every house has a brother who strives for the welfare of sisters.Though she did not name Ajit Pawar, the comment drew immediate attention in Maharashtra’s political circles, with speculation that it reflected family tensions after the NCP split.Even after the jibe, Sule later insisted her remarks were not personal and that the family remained intact.The party was still split in two parts.In recent months, as local body polls approached, signs emerged that the two NCP factions were keeping channels open. In December 2025, Sule said her party was in talks with Ajit Pawar’s camp and that senior leaders had spoken to each other.The political pragmatism was visible in recent civic contests in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, where the two NCP factions were seen aligning tactically to avoid a split in traditional Pawar support bases.For years, Supriya Sule and Ajit Pawar represented two different but complementary strands of Pawar politics: Sule as the measured national voice of the party in Parliament, and Ajit Pawar as the hard-driving rural organiser and administrator who built his strength in the cooperative belt.Ajit Pawar's death now raises immediate questions over the future of his NCP faction and its relationship with Sharad Pawar's group, with political circles already buzzing about whether the tragedy may accelerate a possible merger between the two outfits.For the Pawar family, however, the moment has collapsed politics into mourning.Meanwhile, CM Devendra Fadanvis announced a state holiday and three days of mourning. His last rites will be held on Thursday.","Ajit pawar (66), a six-time deputy chief minister and one of maharashtra's most influential leaders, was killed along with others when his chartered aircraft, which was attempting to land, crashed near baramati airport.

OPS's reunion pitch: A challenge or a last attempt?

Why EPS rejected the offer

Why OPS looks desperate ahead of 2026 polls

3 scenarios for OPS ahead of assembly election

Scenario 1: Backdoor NDA entry via AMMK (most likely)

OPS joins NDA through Dhinakaran's AMMK arrangement.

Gets 2–3 seats from AMMK's quota.

Stays in the game, avoids total invisibility.

Risk

Scenario 2: Go solo-lite with BJP support (possible)

OPS contests with BJP backing, either on BJP's symbol or as an Independent.

Helps BJP widen footprint in the south.

Keeps OPS out of AMMK shadow.

Risk

Scenario 3: AIADMK reunion miracle (least likely)

EPS allows a return under some formula.

OPS returns with symbolic honour.

Reunion narrative energises some cadres.

Risk

NEW DELHI: Expelled AIADMK leader O Panneerselvam (OPS) on Thursday publicly declared that he was ""ready"" for reunification with Edappadi K Palaniswami ’'s (EPS) AIADMK faction ahead of Tamil Nadu 's 2026 assembly polls.At a press meet in Madurai, OPS threw a pointed challenge at both EPS and AMMK general secretary TTV Dhinakaran, asking whether they were prepared to take the leap. ""I am ready for that. Are they ready?"" he said, invoking the possibility of rival factions closing ranks under the NDA umbrella.But EPS's response was a door-slam: ""There is no chance of admitting OPS into AIADMK. OPS has already been removed from the basic membership position."" EPS cited the party's general council, which had expelled OPS in 2023, saying there could be no re-induction.The sharp exchange has reopened a question Tamil Nadu politics has been quietly circling for months: what does OPS do in 2026. A three-time chief minister and once a stand-in in AIADMK for J Jayalalithaa after her death, why is he pushing so hard now?OPS's reunion line comes amid a BJP-driven effort to revive and expand the NDA alliance in Tamil Nadu. With BJP increasingly invested in forging an anti-DMK front, the party has been nudging splintered AIADMK factions to align, or at least avoid damaging vote-splits.In that backdrop, OPS framed reunification as the ""natural"" outcome if EPS and Dhinakaran who were bitter rivals could close ranks. If such a rapprochement is possible, he argued, what stops his return?OPS also returned to his familiar ideological peg: the restoration of MGR-era by-laws and ""cadres' rights"".His committee, later evolved into a kazhagam, he said, exists only to reclaim the party's original rules, not to become a full political party for 2026.When asked about reported talks with BJP's Tamil Nadu in-charge Piyush Goyal and rumours of a 2-seat offer, OPS refused to answer directly, calling it ""parama ragasiyam"" (a profound secret). Dhinakaran, meanwhile, positioned himself as mediator, urging OPS to join NDA to revive the ""Amma regime"".EPS's refusal is being framed by his camp as a matter of party discipline and organisational authority.AIADMK leaders point to the 2023 general council decision expelling OPS for ""anti-party activities"", saying it was a unanimous verdict by a council of over 2,500 members. EPS has repeatedly argued the party cannot return to ""dual leadership"" politics, and that the focus is to defeat the DMK with a consolidated NDA.The BJP too has indicated where it stands. Union home minister Amit Shah has backed EPS as the NDA's leading face for the 2026 contest, with decisions on the future shape of the alliance to be taken post-election.In other words, OPS's biggest problem is not just EPS. It is that the BJP's Tamil Nadu unit has moved on without him.OPS’s urgency is rooted in one blunt reality - political isolation is fast turning into electoral irrelevance.He is a former chief minister with three stints, but in Tamil Nadu’s current alliance arithmetic, OPS has limited negotiating power. This is because he no longer controls three negotiation essentials - a party, a symbol or a demonstrable seat-winning base.In the last two election cycles, OPS has failed to convert name recognition into measurable electoral influence. In 2021 assembly polls, his camp failed to emerge as a force. In the 2024 Lok Sabha election, OPS did not win a seat, contesting as an Independent under the jackfruit symbol, which he described as a ""test of cadre support"" for his reunification pitch.Meanwhile, OPS has also been structurally locked out of the AIADMK. EPS’s camp points to OPS's 2023 expulsion for ""anti-party activities"", endorsed by a 2,500+ member general council, making re-entry not a matter of personal goodwill but a question of organisational authority. Without access to district units and booth machinery, OPS is left with .just sentiment politics and not the election machinery.The bigger squeeze is coming from the NDA itself. BJP, which once saw OPS as a useful fracture point inside AIADMK, now appears firmly invested in EPS-led consolidation. In this ecosystem, OPS is being offered only a small role: TOI sources suggest 2–3 seats, either through AMMK's quota or a BJP-backed independent route.That might be why OPS is pushing ""reunion"" so publicly. In 2026, his fight is not for power, but to stay politically alive.Apart from this, OPS is also facing a personal political deadline. At around 75, he has limited time to rebuild. His reunion pitch for EPS can therefore be read not only as a negotiation tactic, but also a legacy attempt - a final effort to remain relevant in the story of AIADMK after Jayalalithaa.With EPS shutting the door, OPS effectively has only three options left ahead of assembly poll:: Becomes a junior player under Dhinakaran and BJP, with limited voice.: Without AIADMK machinery, OPS may remain confined to pockets.: EPS may only accept him on strict terms, or not at all.OPS's recent ""I'm ready for reunion"" pitch is not merely a message to EPS or Dhinakaran.It is a signal to the BJP-led NDA: don't finalise 2026 election plan without me. But Tamil Nadu's political reality is unforgiving. Currently, the NDA alliance math is being built around EPS-first consolidation and OPS is being negotiated not as a central point but as a marginal add-on, with talk of only 2–3 seats.That is why he has wrapped a survival bid in the language of legacy - MGR by-laws, cadre rights and unity.The question now is simple: will the AIADMK gates reopen for OPS, or will 2026 mark his last election appearance as a consequential player?","O panneerselvam publicly declared that he was ""ready"" for reunification with edappadi k palaniswami ’'s (eps) aiadmk faction ahead of tamil nadu's 2026 assembly polls.

Coking coal notified as 'critical and strategic mineral',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coking-coal-notified-as-critical-and-strategic-mineral/articleshow/127783502.cms,".

NEW DELHI: With demand for imported coking coal—an essential input for the steel industry—continuing to rise despite large domestic reserves, the govt on Thursday notified coking coal as a “critical and strategic mineral” to accelerate exploration and mining activities, including those involving deep-seated deposits.The decision was made on the recommendations of the High-Level Committee on Implementation of Viksit Bharat Goals and policy inputs from NITI Aayog, which recognised the strategic role of coking coal in ensuring mineral security and meeting the needs of domestic steel sector.Officials said India has an estimated 37.4 billion tonnes of coking coal resources, largely located in Jharkhand, with Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh also having deposits.Despite this domestic availability, imports of coking coal increased from 51.2 million tonnes in 2020–21 to 57.6 million tonnes in 2024–25, meeting about 95% of the steel sector’s requirements.To address this continued dependence on imports, coal (including coking coal) has been included in Part D of the First Schedule of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, which lists critical and strategic minerals.The mining of critical minerals is exempt from public consultation requirements and allows the use of degraded forest land for compensatory afforestation—measures expected to encourage greater private sector participation.The reform is expected to reduce import dependence, strengthen supply-chain resilience for steel sector and support the objectives of National Steel Policy. It is also likely to promote private investment in exploration and beneficiation, encourage the adoption of advanced mining technologies and generate employment across the mining, logistics and steel value chain.","India has an estimated 37.4 billion tonnes of coking coal resources, largely located in jharkhand.

NEW DELHI: Coal will continue to play a central role in India’s energy mix as the country works towards tripling its per capita energy consumption over the next 20 years, Union Coal Secretary Vikram Dev Dutt said on Thursday.He was speaking during a panel discussion on the third day of India Energy Week 2026.“Coal is not going away in a hurry. For India, affordable and dependable baseload power is not a choice; it is an imperative. The mantra is not ‘phase out’, it is ‘phase down’ in calibrated steps that reflect ground realities,” he said. Dutt added that coal underpins India’s development needs and will continue to do so even as renewables scale up alongside climate commitments.According to the Economic Survey 2025–26, coal plays an important role in India’s energy landscape, contributing 55% to the national energy mix and fuelling over 74% of total power generation. India’s total installed power generation capacity currently stands at nearly 514 gigawatts (GW), comprising about 247 GW of thermal capacity. Annual per capita energy consumption currently stands at 1,460 kWh and is expected to increase to 2,000 kWh by 2030 and over 4,000 kWh by 2047.Highlighting the global perspective, Kyle Haustveit, Assistant Secretary for Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, emphasised that coal remains critical for energy security worldwide.“Coal powered the modern world and it is not going away. Reliable, affordable and secure energy matters, and coal provides that stability, regardless of weather or market volatility,” he said. He highlighted the strong potential for India–US collaboration in clean coal technologies, coal gasification, carbon utilisation, and trade in high-quality metallurgical coal.Chairman-cum-Managing Director of Coal India Limited, B. Sairam, said coal will act as a bridge and enabler in India’s transition. “India’s per capita energy consumption is barely a third of that in developed economies. As this demand triples, coal will provide firm, dispatchable power while renewables and storage mature,” he said.","Coal will continue to play a central role in india’s energy mix as the country works towards tripling its per capita energy consumption over the next 20 years, says the union coal secretary.

NEW DELHI: In an urgent missive to Election Commission, Congress on Thursday accused the ruling BJP of using the EC’s Form 7 to target genuine voters for wrongful deletion in the Claim and Objection phase of the SIR in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam and Kerala.AICC general secretary and MP KC Venugopal, in a complaint to EC, termed the watchdog’s inaction in addressing concerns about systematic subversion of electoral rolls revision as worrisome and urged immediate steps to prevent BJP from misusing the electoral rolls to gain unfair electoral advantage.“These actions, if not taken cognizance of by the Commission, ... will lead to the disenfranchisement of lakhs of voters, especially those belonging to the backward, marginalised communities,” he said, adding that backward communities are being targeted by BJP.Venugopal said Form 7 serves a narrow purpose of raising objection to a voter’s name with fact-based reasons like death or duplication, and “is not meant for generalised or speculative objections”. He said the burden of proof too rests on the person filing the Form, with penalties prescribed for making a false submission.Specifying the pattern involved in engineering wrongful deletion, Venugopal said Form 7 is being generated in bulk through a centralised system, which is then being used to raise objections in bulk against targetted categories of electors, including SCs, STs, the minorities and senior citizens.He said these forms are then being handed over to BLOs across multiple constituencies through a well-organised mechanism. The striking feature here is the absence of clear and verifiable particulars of the individual submitting the Form 7, though EC mandates disclosure of an objector’s identity along with documentary material substantiating the objection. He said in many instances, the alleged objectors denied filing the objections.“This casts serious doubts over the sanctity of the entire SIR process being undertaken,” he said.Congress urged EC to institute real-time supervision over the voter deletion process and the monitoring of Form 7 applications, including their issuance and submission. It also sought investigation under Article 324 into misuse of Form 7. Congress further urged EC to release disaggregated data relating to Form-7 applications for all 12 States undergoing SIR.","Congress accuses the ruling bjp of using the ec’s form 7 to target genuine voters for wrongful deletion.

NEW DELHI: Actor-politician Vijay's father SA Chandrasekhar has appealed to the Congress to forge an electoral alliance with his son's Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) for the upcoming Tamil Nadu assembly election, claiming it could help the grand old party regain its ""old glory"" in the state.

Vijay is ready to give them support and get them back to their old glory,"" he said.Chandrasekhar said the Congress had been backing other parties for years and was gradually losing relevance in Tamil Nadu politics.

GUWAHATI: Opposition Congress on Wednesday held a protest in Assam's Kamrup district against alleged ""vote theft"" through the Special Revision (SR).The protest was organised in front of the office of the Boko–Chaygaon Sub-Divisional Commissioner against actions of BJP workers who allegedly entered the office at night and interfered with the deletion and inclusion of names in the voters' list.Addressing the protesters, Congress MLA Rakibuddin Ahmed criticised the recent remarks made by Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.""The entire SR process is nothing but a tactic to steal the opposition's votes. The EC is helping the BJP in this game. On the other hand, our CM is making only polarising statements.""For the past 2-3 days, the CM has been repeatedly making statements at public meetings that Miyas should be punished. It is really unfortunate that a CM is making such a statement against one community,"" he added.Ahmed said such remarks were unbecoming of a chief minister and unacceptable as the people concerned have been living in Assam for hundreds of years.""These people are deeply connected with the land, its culture, dignity and unity. The BJP is attempting to create divisions in Assam, and the CM's repeated calls to harass a particular community and to delete their votes are reprehensible and a dangerous sign for democracy,"" he added.After the protest, Congress leaders and workers met the election authorities and demanded strict action against the alleged irregularities.Stating that ""Bangladeshi Miyas"" live in Assam, Sarma on Wednesday said more than five lakh complaints have been filed by BJP workers during the SR process against such ""foreigners"".'Miya' is originally a pejorative term used for Bengali-speaking Muslims in Assam and the non-Bengali speaking people generally identify them as Bangladeshi immigrants. In recent years, activists from the community have started adopting this term as a gesture of defiance.Assam has registered a 1.35 per cent increase in voters according to the integrated draft electoral rolls for the state, published on December 30 after SR was conducted ahead of the Assembly elections.The draft rolls after the SR reflected a total of 2,52,01,624 electors, representing a 1.35 per cent increase from the previous final rolls published in January 2025.A total of 7,86,841 additions and 4,47,196 deletions have taken place from January 6 to December 27 last year.During the SR process, 4,78,992 deceased electors and 5,23,680 shifted electors were identified. Another 53,619 multiple entries were identified.The Election Commission, however, said that these names have not yet been deleted. These will only be processed for removal or shifting after formal applications are received during the current claims and objections period.The final electoral rolls will be published on February 10.","Opposition congress held a protest in assam's kamrup district against alleged ""vote theft"" through the special revision (sr) the protest was organised in front of the office of the boko–chaygaon sub-divisional commissioner.
