NEW DELHI: Two terrorists were killed as security forces foiled an infiltration bid along the Line of Control (LoC) in Gurez sector of Jammu and Kashmir's Bandipora district, the army said on Thursday.The operation, codenamed Naushera Nar IV, is being jointly carried out by the army and the Jammu & Kashmir Police (JKP).“Based on intelligence inputs from JKP regarding a likely infiltration attempt, a joint operation was launched in the Gurez sector. Alert troops spotted suspicious movement and challenged the intruders, who opened indiscriminate fire. Troops retaliated effectively, neutralising two terrorists,” the army’s Srinagar-based Chinar Corps said in a statement on X.The Chinar Corps added that the operation is still in progress.On Monday, security forces also foiled an infiltration attempt in the Union Territory's Uri sector. Earlier, on August 13, a soldier was killed in action while troops were repelling a similar bid in the same area.","Two terrorists were killed as security forces foiled an infiltration bid along the line of control (loc) in jammu and kashmir's bandipora district.

Five people were rescued with the help of boats, even as searches continued for the missing minor late into Wednesday night.The nine were all relatives and members of Gadri community from Chittorgarh’s Kanakheda village. They were returning from a visit to Sawai Bhoj temple in neighbouring Bhilwara district, and relied on Google Maps for an alternative route as police had erected barricades on roads leading to flooded areas.The app led them to the closed Somi-Uprera bridge over Banas river, which was in spate due to heavy rains that had battered the region for the past three to four days. When the driver tried to manoeuvre the car across the bridge, the vehicle got stuck in a pothole and was washed away by the strong currents, police said.With trapped passengers screaming for help, many locals rushed to the spot and began rescue efforts with aid from the district administration.

NEW DELHI: Calling PM Narendra Modi pure like the holy water of the Ganga, BJP Wednesday hit out at Congress MP Rahul Gandhi for his denunciation of the ""Gujarat model"" and accused the Gandhi family of being the most corrupt and ""chor parivar (family of thieves)"" in the country.BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia's attack on Rahul came after he alleged during his public meetings in Bihar that the Gujarat model, projected as a showpiece for growth when Modi was the state's chief minister, was ""all about vote chori"". ""If there is one family that is the most corrupt and 'chor' (thief), then it is the 'nakli' (fake) Gandhi family. Sonia Gandhi , Robert Vadra and Rahul Gandhi are out on bail in corruption cases."" Bhatia also reminded Rahul how his ""chowkidar chor hai"" slogan against Modi had backfired. Modi is ""pure like the Gangajal"" as he is fully dedicated to the service of people, Bhatia said, as he criticised Rahul for levelling an unfounded allegation and using tasteless language against the PM.","Bjp spokesperson gaurav bhatia's attack on rahul came after he alleged during his public meetings in bihar that the gujarat model was ""all about vote chori"" ""if there is one family that is the most corrupt and 'chor' (thief), then it is the 'nakli' (fake) gandhi family,"" he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123554687,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1637923,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The sentiment for a boycott of the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) on the bill on dismissal of jailed ministers is growing, with Communist Party of India (CPI) on Tuesday saying that the parliamentary panels are a sham and serve no purpose under BJP govt. The CPI stance after boycott decision by four opposition parties will increase the pressure on Congress to follow suit.CPI MP Sandosh Kumar said the JPC on Waqf bill has proven lucidly that such panels are just an attempt to show collective scrutiny of the bill when they are actually an eyewash. “There was a time when members on the JPC could summon documents, scrutinise details and then make contributions. Now, the opposition’s suggestions are rejected out of hand. The JPC on Waqf bill is an example. It is of no value,” he told TOI .While the Left parties don’t have the strength to be in the parliamentary panels and depend on the govt’s goodwill to find a place in them, the CPI opinion carries weight since it could be seen as representative of other smaller Left constituents.The sentiment of an integral part of the opposition INDIA bloc follows announcements by TMC, Samajwadi Party, Sena UBT and AAP that they will not participate in the JPC that is being formed to scrutinise the controversial bills, including the constitutional amendment.The offensive from the bigger INDIA bloc parties has forced Congress to take a relook at its inclination to join the proposed JPC in the interest of opposition unity. There is regret in Congress that compulsion of unity may nudge the party into following the cue of TMC-SP-Shiv Sena, arguing it will result in complications for the future, as well as when the three controversial bills come up in the parliament for discussion.Many key INDIA bloc parties like DMK, NCP (SP) and CPM have not spoken out yet, since they seem to be waiting for Congress to take a final decision. A Left outfit MP said no party would want to stand alone on the issue that will be viewed as a test of unity of the bloc.This has triggered speculation that a complete opposition boycott of the JPC is possible. While this marks a major division in the anti-BJP ranks, for a change it is not a split that ends up favouring BJP, but one of competitive hostility to the govt’s initiative. “We have to know how far we should go, because these are important issues where some points have to be put on record,” a pro-JPC MP said.",Cpi mp sandosh kumar said the jpc on waqf bill has proven lucidly that such panels are just an attempt to show collective scrutiny of the bill when they are actually an eyewash.

SSC Recruitment Scam: Massive Protest In Kolkata, Police Detains Protesting Teachers Amid Scuffles

Poll What is your opinion on the switch from TCS to Eduquity as the exam conducting agency? A positive change A negative change

NEW DELHI: Amid protests over glitches and irregularities in the conduct of computer-based govt recruitment examinations by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), SSC chairman S Gopalakrishnan on Monday assured that the “technical and operational matters” faced by a few candidates in the first selection post examination on July 24, have been “stabilised” and no major disruptions anticipated in the upcoming exams.Gopalakrishnan said around 5.5 lakh candidates had appeared in the first exam, the first to be held after M/s Eduquity replaced M/s TCS as the exam conducting agency (ECA) in July 2025, with questions being set by other content agencies and delivered digitally from a vault. Some candidates at two of the total 194 centres faced issues due to bugs, like duplication of questions, repeat of same options, etc.“A detailed analysis by CDAC identified about 59,000 candidates affected by system disruptions. They will now retake the exam in three shifts on August 29, 2025,” he said adding that the stenographer exams conducted from Aug 6-8 had witnessed no disruptions. SSC has also rescheduled the Combined Graduate Level (CGL) Exam from August 13 to mid-September.On Congress alleging “rigging” of government recruitment exams under the Modi government and slamming the “brutal lathicharge” on those protesting against it, SSC alleged that the protests, led by coaching institutes, were aimed at protecting business models rather than the genuine interests of candidates.Elaborating on the recent SSC examination reforms, Gopalakrishnan said aadhaar-based authentication at the application level and exam venue has helped prevent impersonation and repeated attempts by candidates to appear in multiple sessions or to take the role of scribes and exam functionaries. Also, deviation from old question patterns had denied the coaching institutes undue advantage. Rather than a single agency like TCS performing all tasks, SSC, has, from July onwards, entrusted different aspects of the examinations to four agencies.Eduquity is now the ECA, even as content agencies set the questions, CDAC handles IT security and detects hacking/malpractices and an independent agency monitors the exams. The idea is that no single agency can hijack or compromise the exams, and to maintain transparency and fairness, according to Gopalakrishnan.He further noted that the content providers, ECA and monitoring agencies are subject to deterrent penalties for any shortcomings in performance.The multiple agency system, it was highlighted, has resulted in certain entities (led by some online tutors or coaching institutes) attributing the initial system hiccups to ECA and demanding that TCS be brought back. Gopalakrishnan however explained that Eduquity was selected through a tender, with TCS listed only at third position in the bid.","Ssc chairman s gopalakrishnan assured that the “technical and operational matters” faced by a few candidates in the first selection post examination on july 24, have been “stabilised” no major disruptions anticipated in the upcoming exams.

NEW DELHI: At least 34 people lost their lives after heavy rains triggered a landslide near the Vaishno Devi shrine in Jammu and Kashmir.Heavy rain and flash floods also wreaked havoc in Kashmir Valley causing severe damage to infrastructure.This comes days after flash floods triggered by a cloudburst struck Kishtwar district's Chisoti, the last motorable village en route to the Machail Mata temple, on August 14, killing 65 people, mostly pilgrims, and leaving more than 100 injured.Officials said the death toll from the Vaishno Devi landslide has risen to 34 after heavy rains that triggered a landslide near the Vaishno Devi shrine in Jammu and Kashmir's Reasi district.The landslide struck near Indraprastha Bhojanalaya at Ardhkuwari en route to Vaishno Devi cave shrine in Reasi around 3pm on Tuesday, officials said.Authorities halted pilgrim movement until weather clears.The Northern Railways cancelled the next day's 22 trains halting at or departing from Jammu and Katra railway stations, and short-terminated 27 trains in the division.""Twenty-seven trains have been short-terminated on Tuesday.This has been done in view of the prevailing weather conditions in the region,"" Public Relations Officer (PRO) of Northern Railway, Jammu Division, said.Of the 22 cancelled, nine trains are from Katra, the base camp of the Mata Vaishno Devi shrine, and one from Jammu, officials said.The remaining trains were scheduled to arrive at Katra, Jammu and Udhampur stations.Train services have also been suspended from Pathankot to Kandrori in Himachal Pradesh due to heavy soil erosion and flash floods at the Chakki River on Tuesday.J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah said he spoke with PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah to brief them on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir after heavy rains caused major damage and disruption, especially in the Jammu region.In posts on X, Abdullah wrote:PM Modi expressed grief over the Vaishno Devi landslide tragedy that claimed 34 lives so far.

5 Kerala ex-police officers acquitted in custodial death case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-kerala-ex-police-officers-acquitted-in-custodial-death-case/articleshow/123554212.cms,".

KOCHI: Kerala high court Wednesday acquitted five former police officers, including one who was sentenced to death by a trial court in the Udayakumar custodial murder case. The murder took place at Thiruvananthapuram’s Fort Police Station in 2005.A bench of Justices V Raja Vijayaraghavan and K V Jayakumar set aside the conviction and sentences of former ASI K Jithakumar, former crime branch DSP T Ajith Kumar, retired SP E K Sabu and retired ACP T K Haridas, citing serious lapses in the CBI investigation. Jithakumar and S V Sreekumar had been awarded the death penalty by a CBI special court, while the others were sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. Sreekumar died in 2020, during the pendency of the appeal, while another accused, Soman, had died pending trial.According to the prosecution, P Udayakumar, a 28-year-old man, was picked up by Jithakumar and Sreekumar at around 2.15am on Sept 27, 2005, while with a friend at Sreekanteswaram Park. A sum of Rs 4,000 was recovered from him, and he was taken to Fort Police Station, and then to the circle inspector’s office nearby where he was allegedly subjected to custodial violence. He was later declared dead at the medical college hospital.The prosecution claimed his death resulted from torture in custody.The initial CB-CID probe arraigned only three officers as accused, but the trial faltered as most prosecution witnesses turned hostile. Udayakumar’s mother then moved the HC, which ordered a CBI probe. CBI arraigned eight more police officers as accused; on the same day, their applications seeking pardons were filed before court. Pardon was granted on the condition that they make full and true disclosure of all facts and circumstances. CBI later filed its final report, naming six officers as accused. The trial court convicted and sentenced them, leading to the appeals before the HC.The bench held that CBI committed a serious illegality by filing its final report before a magistrate’s court in a case already committed to a sessions court, thereby violating the right of the accused to a fair trial. The procedure adopted in seeking pardons before the chief judicial magistrate was also found to be ex facie illegal and contrary to mandatory provisions of CrPC.","The murder took place at thiruvananthapuram’s fort police station in 2005.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday reiterated the need to focus on self-reliance and 'vocal-for-local' while chairing the cabinet meeting. He also said India is ready to face all challenges and asked ministers to encourage and motivate people to buy more 'Made in India' products, TOI has learnt.The PM's remarks gain significance as the US doubled tariffs on many imports from India to 50%. Modi has been consistently promoting 'Made in India' products, and in recent weeks, he has urged traders and shopkeepers to put up boards saying ""swadeshi goods sold here"". 'Swadeshi' should be the 'mantra', and irrespective of who puts in the investment, production must be Indian, Modi had said on Tuesday.Sources said that in a list of suggestions, Modi has urged ministers to spread the message of govt expanding the coverage of PM Svanidhi scheme meant for street vendors so that more people can get the benefit of subsidised loans, and to see that the beneficiaries get specially designed T-shirts so that they can be identified quickly. This will help spread the message of govt's focus on welfare of the poor, they added.PM also asked ministers to hold events of their ministries and departments across the country instead of just hosting them in Delhi so that people know about the activities and schemes undertaken by the Centre. There will be greater focus on holding such events and programmes in poll-bound states. ""Ministers have been advised to see that ministries and departments don't host more than one international event in two years since officials end up spending a lot of time for their preparation,"" said a source.",Pm narendra modi reiterated the need to focus on self-reliance and 'vocal-for-local' he also said india is ready to face all challenges and asked ministers to encourage and motivate people to buy more 'made in india' products.

Want to get elected as VP to protect Constitution: Sudershan Reddy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/want-to-get-elected-as-vp-to-protect-constitution-sudershan-reddy/articleshow/123552318.cms,"PTI file photo

What led you to join the VP post contest in times considered to be highly polarised?

What do you have to say about the talk that numbers are already skewed in favour of NDA?

How do you see HM Amit Shah’s criticism of your judgment on disbanding anti-Maoist Salwa Judum militia, and BJP seeing the verdict through the prism of judicial bias?

What do you have to say on Shah’s criticism of your judgment on eviction of security forces from school buildings where they were lodged as part of anti-Maoist ops?

Your response to the statement of 18 ex-judges supporting you and around 56 others opposing?

What about criticism of ex-judges seeking constitutional posts — ex-CJI Ranjan Gogoi accepting RS nomination and c

oncerns about impartiality of judiciary in 1967 when ex-CJI Subba Rao contested for VP post.

You have been meeting the leaders of various opposition parties. Your response to the contest being framed like a Tamil pride versus Telugu pride? Your reaction to YSRCP supporting the NDA candidate?

Interview of opposition Vice Presidential candidate Justice (retired) B Sudershan Reddy (Excerpts)Society is getting increasingly polarised. This must be stopped because I believe the biggest threat doesn’t come from govts alone in a democracy but the threat comes from citizens themselves when they try to divide society on the basis of religion, caste, language and region. To arrest this tendency I thought of contesting this election.I am a liberal Constitutional democrat and I want to get elected as the VP of the country to defend and protect the Constitution of India. Hitherto my duty was to uphold the Constitution. That is the distinction between the oath administered to a judge and Vice President and President of India.You know there is no whip, political parties as such do not vote. It is the members of the Parliament who vote and it is a secret ballot. Political party business should not enter this arena. Parties may choose their candidate but ultimately voters are the members of Parliament. Therefore, I don’t understand this fight of numbers...I am very optimistic and am going to appeal to all members of all political parties and I will be formally releasing a letter addressing all MPs soon.It is their choice. There are six balls in one over. After the sixth ball nothing remains.I think 5 or 6 are perhaps already over. Some are spinners, some are fast bowlers. Some spin they are trying. The most unfortunate thing is that no one would make such a comment if they have read the judgement. Infact, in the Salwa Judum judgement I was speaking about the menace of violence. I further said that it is the Constitutional duty and obligation of the state to protect the rights and liberty of its citizens. I said you cannot outsource your right to use arms whenever it is necessary to protect the society. I had said please do your duty and do not involve these innocent tribals.In those maoist areas, who are those kids going to school? They have hardly any facilities and whatever schools that were in existence were under the control of security forces depriving the children the right to get educated which is a guaranteed right. Apart from the Right To Education Act even the Constitution gives them that right. Should I presume that the mighty state is unable to provide accomodation to its security forces and occupied the school and college buildings. What is it that I said? You have taken away the school building, let the school be run.If a judge discharges his Constitutional obligation, interpreting the Constitution as per law as established can be dubbed and characterised as a bias tomorrow. God,...if there is one, save this country.What do I say about it? When I say divisive forces are at work this is what I meant. I must thank the 56 colleagues - authors of this text who may have signed or not...they gave me unsolicited advice that it is a political contest, you face it. I never asked them if it is a political contest or not because I have been repeatedly saying that it is a high Constitutional office.I won’t speak about any specific person. I am not asking anyone to nominate me. I am seeking an election appealing to MPs to consider my candidature on merit. Former CJI Subba Rao was attacked for writing the Golaknath judgment where you find the origin and basis of formulating that fundamental rights cannot be altered by Parliament. There is a foundation laid in that very judgment about the basic structure. Later, Kesavananda Bharati merely clarified that no it is not as if no part of the Constitution can be amended. ..it is not as if no part of fundamental rights can be amended but the Constitution’s basic structure cannot be amended. Those perhaps who believed at that time that anything and everything can be amended and that Justice Rao through Golaknath was coming in the way, therefore they unleashed an attack.In Salwa Judum, I was talking about social justice, the ideals enshrined in the Preamble, civil rights and liberties of the people and a Constitutional doctrine that the State alone has the monopoly to use weapons to quell violence. It cannot hire the services of an organised group. The moment you speak about some values in the Constitution, it is not palatable to some, they start spinning it.Ans: This nation is one. India that is Bharat is a union of states. There is no separate citizenship for Tamil Nadu and Telangana. Neither Shri CP Radhakrishnan ji has chosen to be born in Tamil Nadu nor Justice Sudershan Reddy chose to be born in Telangana. So there is nothing like Telangana versus Tamil Nadu. As far as YSRCP is concerned it is their political leadership’s choice but I don’t know what their MPs will do as there is no whip and it is a secret ballot. Therefore, why should I not appeal to everyone to consider my candidature for vice president when they vote.","Justice (retired) b sudershan reddy says society is getting increasingly polarised.
