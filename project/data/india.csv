Rain fury in Mumbai

NEW DELHI: IndiGo on Wednesday issued a travel advisory in the wake of heavy rain expected in Mumbai, which the airline said could ""lead to air traffic congestion and impact flight operations"".""While we want your journey to be as hassle-free as possible, Mother Nature has her own plans. With heavy rains expected again in Mumbai, there’s a chance this could lead to air traffic congestion and impact flight operations,"" the issue said.The IndiGo assured that any changes to the flight schedule will be shared with the passengers and urged them to spare extra time for the commute.""While we continue doing our best to keep operations smooth, we recommend planning ahead. Any changes to your flight schedule will be shared via your registered contact details, so do ensure they’re up to date. Check your flight status on our website or app before heading to the airport. And with waterlogging and slow-moving traffic likely, allow some extra time for your commute,"" the release by the airline said.On Tuesday, flight operations suffered partially in the city amid the heavy rains. From Monday midnight to 7 pm Tuesday, 11 flights were diverted to other airports, while 24 arriving flights were forced to abort landing and climb to make a second attempt at touchdown.The cascading delays hit flight schedules through the day, and worst hit were passengers booked on evening flights, with arrivals and departures delayed by an hour.Just like Monday, auto and taxi refusals were rampant. Power outages were witnessed in the suburbs. Kurla suffered as two substations of Adani Electricity shut down, affecting 1,000 families. Andheri, Jogeshwari, Kandivli, Ghatkopar, Vile Parle and Mira Road also saw power cuts.In one of the record number of diversions by BEST in recent years, 135 bus routes were diverted due to waterlogging on roads as heavy rain crippled Mumbai on Tuesday.The India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) red alert for Tuesday proved spot-on as the city endured another day of intense rainfall, making this the wettest Aug in five years. So far, 891 mm of rain has been recorded, well above the average monthly rainfall of 560.8 mm. The last time Mumbai saw higher Aug rainfall was in the year 2020, when 1,240.1 mm was recorded.The monsoon season total has also crossed expectations, reaching 2,193.2 mm, surpassing the average of 2,101.8 mm.Rainfall data further indicates that this has been one of Mumbai’s longest intense rain spells in recent years. In the past 108 hours (Aug 15–19), the city received 837.3 mm, with three of the five days logging close to or over 200 mm. This exceeds the total rainfall of June (512.7 mm) and July (797.3 mm); July is normally considered the year’s wettest month.Tuesday’s downpour was clearly much more intense than Monday’s. The IMD Santacruz observatory recorded 163.4 mm rain in a nine-hour period between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm — more than Monday’s tally of 129.1 mm for the same period. Vikhroli too saw a sharp spike at 161.5 mm, up from 139.5 mm, while Juhu, Byculla and Bandra logged marginal increases. Colaba weather station also recorded 63 mm of rain in the same period compared to 55.4 mm the previous day.The 24-hour period ending 8.30 am on Aug 19 also saw some extremely heavy rain being recorded of over 300 mm in some pockets. Chincholi in Malad reported a staggering 361 mm, one of the highest across the city.Tuesday’s spell added to a rare pattern — Mumbai inching towards yet another 200 mm-plus rain day within less than a week, after logging 244 mm between Aug 15-16 and 238 mm on Aug 18–19. In the 12 hours ending 8.30 pm on Tuesday, the IMD Santacruz observatory had already recorded 171.2 mm of rain.The rain fury also spilled into the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, with Thane, Kalyan, Vasai and Virar reporting triple-digit showers. In the 24 hours ending 8.30 am on Aug 19, Vasai recorded 219 mm of rain while Navi Mumbai logged in 185 mm.The rain fury is expected to continue till Wednesday under an orange alert for Mumbai, with the IMD indicating some relief only from Thursday, when a yellow alert has been issued signalling reduced intensity.","Indigo issues a travel advisory in the wake of heavy rain expected in mumbai.

Stricter laws and enforcement Awareness and community support

NEW DELHI: A 13-year-old girl from north-west Delhi's Bharat Nagar, who left home following a dispute with her father, was rescued nearly a month later after being trafficked and forcibly married off in Uttar Pradesh.She boarded a train that took her to Meerut, where two men lured her with false promises and took her to Shamli.There, she was illegally married to a 40-year-old man. A fake Aadhaar card was used to show her age as 19 years.The girl's missed call to her grandmother eventually led to her rescue. Police have arrested three men in connection with the case.Police sources said the force got a complaint about a missing girl on July 22. Despite continuous effort by the family and the police, she could not be traced at first. A case was registered under Section 137 (kidnapping) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).""While we were searching for the girl, her family informed us that they had received a missed call from an unknown number. When they called back, a woman answered and said her daughter-in-law might have made the call, then abruptly disconnected it.The number provided by the family had one incorrect digit, and when a police team followed that lead to Mathura, it turned out to be false, a police source said. Later, after obtaining the correct phone number, the team traced the location to Shamli and rescued the girl from a home.Police later learned that the girl had left her home and taken a bus to a railway station and randomly boarded a train that led her to Meerut.While she was wandering in the station, she encountered a 20-year-old man, who promised to help her settle down. However, it was a trap. The man from Hapur, along with a 55-year-old associate from Meerut, took the girl to Shamli, where they forced her to marry a 40-year-old man on July 24 in exchange for Rs 15,000-20,000. They made a fake Aadhaar card to falsify her age as 19 years.Four days after the forced marriage, the girl was allegedly sexually assaulted by the 40-year-old man at his residence. Police are now investigating whether other minor girls — often from impoverished backgrounds — were similarly trafficked and forcibly married to older men.The duo, and the man who married the girl, have been booked under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), including charges of human trafficking , exploitation of a trafficked person, and forgery of official documents.Additionally, provisions under Sections 6 and 21 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act as well as Sections 9 and 10 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, have been invoked against the trio.The arrests were carried out by a team from the Bharat Nagar police station. When contacted, DCP (northwest) Bhisham Singh said that the investigation was on.","A 13-year-old girl from north-west delhi's bharat nagar was rescued nearly a month later.

Pune: The city received its first substantial showers of Aug on Monday after a largely dry spell this month though the rainfall remained in the light to moderate category.Shivajinagar received 29.8mm of rain, Lohegaon 19.4mm, Chinchwad 29.5mm, Lavale 37.5mm and Magarpatta 18mm between 8.30am and 8.30pm, India Meteorological Department (IMD) showed. The AWS lab at Pashan separately reported 35 mm.IMD has forecast moderate to heavy rain with isolated very heavy rainfall on Tuesday for Pune and neighbouring areas, with warnings of slippery roads, waterlogging, traffic disruption and possible minor landslides in the ghat sections.Explaining the reason for the ongoing rain, IMD scientist S D Sanap said a well-marked low-pressure system over the Bay of Bengal had intensified into a depression by Monday evening. He said: ""This system, currently lying close to the Odisha-Andhra Pradesh coast, is pushing strong monsoon winds into Maharashtra. At the same time, an east-west shear zone (another weather system) around 19°N, roughly at the latitude of Mumbai, is helping channel moisture inland. Together, these systems are bringing widespread showers to Konkan, ghats and interior Maharashtra.Sanap added that another weather feature extending from south Konkan to north Kerala was also enhancing rainfall activity along the coast and ghats, including Mumbai and Pune region.On Monday, rainfall activity picked up across Pune after a subdued first half of Aug. While the city had only reported negligible amounts in the 24 hours ending Monday morning — with Shivajinagar recording 1mm, Pashan 1.9mm, Lohegaon 1mm and Chinchwad 3mm — showers intensified through the day.For Tuesday, officials warned that a few places could receive heavy to very heavy rainfall, and some isolated ghat areas may even see extremely heavy spells.According to the IMD's impact-based forecast, the rain could cause slippery roads, reduced visibility, and major traffic disruption, particularly in low-lying areas prone to waterlogging or near river banks. Officials also cautioned about the risk of tree branches falling and the loosening of rocks in the ghat sections, which could trigger minor landslides or mudslides.Authorities have advised residents to avoid unnecessary travel during heavy rainfall, drive slowly as visibility may be reduced, and stay away from ghat areas prone to landslips.The irrigation department on Monday evening released water from Panshet and Varasgaon dams following intense rain spells in the catchments of both dams. Water released from both dams flowed into Khadakwasla. The live water storage of Khadakwasla was around 53% on Monday evening; however, it is likely to go up after the inflow of water from Panshet and Varasgaon.Officials from the irrigation department said water levels in major dams around Pune were under close watch. Water discharge from Bhatghar, Neera-Devghar and Chaskaman dams was initiated on Monday. More dams were likely to release water on Tuesday as the storages of most were already around 90%. An official said water levels could reach near the full capacities of the dams if intense spells in the catchments continued for a day or two.The official said Panshet, Varasgaon, Mulshi, and Temghar received over 50mm of rainfall each till Monday evening. Pavana received 35mm of rainfall, while Kasarsai recorded 30mm of rain.Alerts have been issued to the municipal corporations of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad about the possible release of water from Khadakwasla, Pavana and Mulshi. ""Khadakwasla is releasing water into the canal for rural areas. The discharge will be initiated in the Mutha river from Khadakwasla in case of a rise in water level,"" an official said.","Shivajinagar received 29.8mm of rain, lohegaon 19.4mm, chinchwad 29.5mm, lavale 37.5 mm and magarpatta 18mm.

Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority said that the total weight of the train rose to around 109 metric tonnes, which exceeded its designed capacity of 104 metric tonnes.

This excess weight caused a break in the mechanical contact between the power rail and the current collector, cutting off the electricity supply required to run the train.

NEW DELHI: ED has arrested Sandeepa Virk, a social media influencer who also ran an online platform with little business, allegedly a front for money laundering.The arrest followed a police case registered in Mohali, with the probe agency conducting raids on Tuesday and Wednesday at multiple locations in Delhi and Mumbai, ED said in a press release.The agency said it found that Virk, who acted in movies and claims to be a cosmetologist, was in regular touch with Angarai Natarajan Sethuraman, a former director of Reliance Capital, which was part of the Anil Ambani group.The ED statement alleged Virk had been communicating with Sethuraman regarding illegal liaising work. It added that this was also confirmed during searches at the residence of Sethuraman, who was a prominent member of the business group's corporate affairs team in Delhi.When contacted, Sethuraman said, ""These allegations are entirely baseless"" and that he had no connection or involvement with Virk or any transactions related to her.In a release, ED said, ""Besides, diversion of funds for personal benefit has been unearthed during course of search.

Besides, home loan of Rs 22 crore was provided by Reliance Capital Limited by violating the prudential norms. Large part of these loans are seen to have been eventually siphoned off and remained unpaid.""Sethuraman said that the home loan he received from Reliance Capital was granted following due process and was secured by the property offered as collateral.Following her arrest, Virk was produced before a special court here on Wednesday, which remanded her to ED custody till Aug 14. Virk's arrest came after searches conducted by the agency in Delhi and Mumbai on her premises and those of her close associates,She is accused of impersonating officers of law enforcement agencies, duping individuals, and participating in a Rs 6 crore fraud against complainant Jasneet Kaur, under the pretext of investment in a film project. The main accused in the fraud, Amit Gupta alias Nageshwar Gupta, was declared a proclaimed offender in Oct 2024.The agency claimed during its searches, it seized ""incriminating documents"" and records, and statements of key persons and associates, including Farrukh Ali, were recorded. ED said its current searches were part of an ongoing investigation into charges against Virk and her associates, who are alleged to have ""exerted undue influence through misrepresentation and defrauded individuals by soliciting money under false promises"".""Virk has acquired immovable property in her name by making false promises and cheating. She claims to be owner of hyboocare.com, a website purportedly selling FDA-approved beauty products. However, the products listed on the site have been found to be non-existent,"" the agency said. It added that its probe revealed that the website floated by Virk lacked basics, such as user registration options. Scrutiny of the website uncovered minimal social media engagement, an inactive WhatsApp contact number, and absence of transparent organisational details, all of which reinforce suspicion of non-genuine commercial activity, ED said.","Ed alleges diversion of funds by angarai natarajan sethuraman.

Vice-Presidential poll: Reddy vs Radhakrishnan puts alliances to test; how the numbers stack up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vice-presidential-poll-reddy-vs-radhakrishnan-puts-alliances-to-test-how-the-numbers-stack-up/articleshow/123385414.cms,"How the numbers stack up

NEW DELHI: The opposition on Tuesday named former Supreme Court judge B Sudershan Reddy as its candidate for the upcoming vice-presidential election. This comes days after the National Democratic Alliance announced Maharashtra governor CP Radhakrishnan as its nominee.The vice-presidential election has turned into a ""South vs South"" contest, with Radhakrishnan hailing from Tamil Nadu and Reddy from Telangana.The NDA’s decision to field CP Radhakrishnan as its vice-presidential candidate has put the DMK in a spot, as rejecting a candidate from Tamil Nadu could be portrayed as disregarding Tamil pride—an issue rivals are expected to highlight in the 2026 campaign.However, extending support to the BJP’s nominee would go against the DMK’s long-standing political positioning against the Centre.Meanwhile, the opposition has countered with its own strategy by fielding an eminent Telugu face, making it difficult for parties in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana—the YSRCP and the BRS—to not back Reddy.""Our cabinet and Congress party, on behalf of the people of Telangana and on behalf of the Telugu community, we request Telugu Desam Party, Janasena, YSR, BRS and AIMIM, all political parties, leaders should unite and try to make Justice Sudarshen Reddy win.After PV Narasimha Rao, Telangana did not get such an opportunity,"" Telangana CM Revanth Reddy said.TDP leader Nara Lokesh, however, met Radhakrishnan in Delhi and extended warm wishes on behalf of his party.The vice president is elected by members of both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, including nominated members of the Upper House. Currently, the NDA holds a comfortable edge. The combined strength of the two Houses stands at 786, factoring in six vacancies—one in the Lok Sabha (Basirhat, West Bengal) and five in the Rajya Sabha (four from Jammu and Kashmir and one from Punjab, where AAP MP Sanjeev Arora stepped down after winning a state assembly bypoll last month).To win, a candidate must secure at least 394 votes, assuming full turnout.The BJP-led NDA is well positioned. It commands the support of 293 MPs in the 542-member Lok Sabha and 129 MPs in the Rajya Sabha (effective strength: 240), including likely backing from nominated members.This gives the ruling alliance a projected total of 422 votes—well above the required majority. However, if a few NDA members rebel and vote for the INDIA bloc candidate, the balance may shift.Under Article 68(2) of the Constitution, an election to fill a vacancy in the office of the vice president due to resignation, death, removal, or otherwise must be held ""as soon as possible.""The person elected will serve a full five-year term from the date of assuming office. The vice-presidential election follows the system of proportional representation by means of a single transferable vote and is conducted via secret ballot, as laid down in Article 66(1). Electors rank candidates in order of preference.The vice president is the second-highest constitutional authority in India and also serves as ex-officio chairperson of the Rajya Sabha.While the tenure is five years, the incumbent continues until a successor takes office. Dhankhar, who took office in August 2022, resigned abruptly citing health reasons. His resignation letter was submitted to President Droupadi Murmu and took effect immediately.","Opposition names former supreme court judge b sudershan reddy as its candidate.

IMD warning

NEW DELHI: Mumbai came to a halt on Tuesday after heavy rain lashed the city, paralysing transport, triggering flooding, and claiming lives across Maharashtra.Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said the next 48 hours would be crucial, as the weather office issued a red alert for several districts including Mumbai, Thane, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg.The city received nearly 300 mm of rain in 24 hours, with the downpour accounting for 37 per cent of Mumbai’s monthly average. Low-lying areas were submerged, railway tracks flooded, and flights delayed or cancelled. Local trains, considered the city’s lifeline, were badly hit as waterlogged tracks brought services to a crawl.In several suburbs, roads turned into rivers. Cars were stranded, buses rerouted, and thousands waded through waist-deep water to reach home. Schools and colleges were shut on Wednesday, with the administration urging people to step out only if necessary.Officials confirmed that at least eight people lost their lives in rain-related incidents, including house collapses and electrocutions. Teams from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) were deployed to carry out rescue operations. Around 2,500 people were evacuated from flood-prone parts of Thane and Raigad.In Raigad, swelling rivers forced authorities to shift families to relief camps. In Ratnagiri, the district administration opened shelter homes for stranded passengers. Rescue boats and helicopters were kept ready as precautionary measures.CM Fadnavis reviewed the situation with disaster management officials and said all agencies were on high alert. “The next 48 hours are crucial. I appeal to people to remain indoors as far as possible. The administration is working round the clock,” he said.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) activated control rooms across the city and kept pumps running to drain water from flooded areas. More than 200 emergency workers were deployed to clear fallen trees and restore blocked roads.Air travel was badly affected, with major carriers like IndiGo, Air India and Vistara reporting delays and cancellations. Passengers were advised to check flight status before heading to the airport. The Mumbai-Goa highway also witnessed traffic snarls due to waterlogging and landslides.The IMD said the intense rain was caused by a low-pressure area over the Arabian Sea, which had strengthened into a depression. “Very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall is expected over Konkan, Goa and parts of central Maharashtra in the next two days,” the bulletin said.Authorities said water levels in major dams were rising rapidly and were being closely monitored. Citizens were urged not to spread rumours and rely only on official advisories.","Mumbai received nearly 300 mm of rain in 24 hours, with the downpour accounting for 37 per cent of mumbai’s monthly average.

NEW DELHI: Sanjay Kumar , a psephologist affiliated with Lokniti-CSDS, apologised on Tuesday for his post on the Maharashtra elections, which claimed a significant dip in the number of voters in two assembly constituencies compared to the Lok Sabha election held just months earlier.""I sincerely apologize for the tweets posted regarding Maharashtra elections. Error occurred while comparing data of 2024 LS and 2024 AS. The data in row was misread by our Data team. The tweet has since been removed. I had no intention of dispersing any form of misinformation,"" the Lokniti-CSDS co-director wrote on X.Sanjay Kumar's apology triggered a massive backlash from the ruling BJP, which ruled out that it was ""an honest error"".BJP I-T department chief Amit Malviya wrote: The apology is in, and Sanjay Kumar is out. Incidentally, when was the last time this protégé of Yogendra Yadav ever got anything right? In all his projections in the run-up to every single election, the BJP is supposedly losing—and when the reverse happens, he turns up on TV justifying how the BJP won. Convenient. He must think TV audiences are fools.""""In his exuberance to feed Congress’s fake narrative on Maharashtra, CSDS put out data without verification.That is not analysis—it is confirmation bias,"" Malviya wrote on X.In his now-deleted post on Maharashtra elections, Sanjay Kumar had claimed that in the assembly constituency 59 (Ramtek) number of voters in 2024 stood at 4,66,203 in the Lok Sabha polls and 2,86,931 in the assembly polls, claiming ""-38.45% decrease in voters"".In his second claim, Kumar had said that in the assembly constituency (Devlali) number of voters in the Lok Sabha was 4,56,072, and during assembly elections it came down to 2,88,141, claiming ""a 36.82% decrease"".Stepping up his attack on Sanjay Kumar, Amit Mavliya further wrote: ""The very institution whose data Rahul Gandhi leaned on to defame the voters of Maharashtra has now admitted that its figures were wrong — not just on Maharashtra, but even on SIR.""The faceoff between the INDIA bloc and the Election Commisson of India (ECI) intensified dramatically on August 7 when Rahul Gandhi ran through a presentation and levelled a ""vote chori"" charge against the poll body in the Mahadevapura assembly constituency of Congress-ruled Karnataka. The opposition had even referred to Kumar's Maharashtra data to attack the poll body and the BJP.Rahul Gandhi on Sunday called the ECI's Special Intensive Revision in the poll-bound Bihar a ""conspiracy to steal"" elections in the upcoming assembly polls.The same day, ECI hit back at Rahul Gandhi and other opposition leaders, rejecting their allegations of vote theft and concerns related to SIR in Bihar as ""misleading"".""Using words like vote chori to mislead people is a disrespect to the Constitution,"" Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar said.Addressing a press conference, the CEC rejected as baseless the allegations of double voting and ""vote theft"" and asserted that all stakeholders are working to make the Bihar Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls a success in a transparent manner.The CEC said Rahul Gandhi should either give a declaration under oath within seven days on his allegations of irregularities in the voter list.""If no declaration under oath given within 7 days, claims will be considered baseless and invalid…,"" he said, adding that those making unfounded allegations should apologise to the nation.Amid the ongoing EC-opposition clash, INDIA bloc on Monday floated the possibility of moving for impeachment of chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, whom it accused of acting like a ""BJP spokesman"" and intimidating opposition parties.It said Election Commission is no longer capable of ensuring a level playing field and, instead, is led by officers who thwart any attempt at probing voter fraud.While the proposal to move for Kumar's removal was discussed briefly in a coordination meeting of opposition parties and is not final, the INDIA bloc chose to amplify it by confirming that the impeachment notice was brainstormed by the allies and drew wide consensus.","Sanjay kumar's apology triggered a massive backlash from the ruling bjp.

Government of Union Territories (Amendment) Bill, 2025

NEW DELHI: The government will on Wednesday introduce three bills in Parliament to provide a legal framework for the removal of prime minister, a Union minister, chief minister, or a minister in a state/Union territory if they are arrested or detained on serious criminal charges.According to PTI, the proposed legislations are: Government of Union Territories (Amendment) Bill, 2025; Constitution (One Hundred and Thirtieth Amendment) Bill, 2025; and Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill, 2025.Union home minister Amit Shah will also move a motion in the Lok Sabha to refer these bills to a joint committee of Parliament.The Government of Union Territories Act, 1963, currently has no provision for the removal of a chief minister or minister if arrested or detained for serious criminal charges. The proposed bill would amend Section 45 of the Act to address this gap.The Constitution lacks provisions for the removal of prime minister, Union ministers, chief ministers, or state/Delhi government ministers if arrested and detained on such charges. The bill seeks to amend Articles 75, 164, and 239AA to create this framework.The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, does not provide for the removal of the UT's chief minister or minister detained on serious criminal charges. The proposed bill would therefore amend Section 54 of the Act seeks to address this.","The government will introduce three bills in parliament on wednesday.

Reddy as judge protected Constitution: Oppn

NEW DELHI: Dubbing the vice-presidential poll as an ""ideological battle"" to counter the assault on constitutional values, the joint opposition announced Tuesday former Supreme Court judge B Sudershan Reddy as its candidate to take on NDA's C P Radhakrishnan, underlining that Reddy is a ""consistent and courageous champion of social, economic and political justice"".The opposition, after a meeting at the residence of Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge , announced Reddy's candidature to end the suspense. ""Reddy... fully reflects the values that shaped our country's freedom movement so profoundly and the values on which our country's Constitution and democracy have been anchored.""All the values on which our Constitution has been anchored are under assault and, therefore, our collective and determined resolve to fight this election, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge read out from a joint statement, adding, ""B Sudershan Reddy is a pro-poor man, and in many of his judgments... he also protected the Constitution and fundamental rights."" Reddy was welcomed at Delhi airport by an opposition delegation in the evening. Opposition MPs will meet in Parliament's Central Hall Wednesday, while Reddy will file his nomination on Thursday.Source said at the meeting attended by K C Venugopal, Sharad Pawar (NCP-SP), M A Baby (CPM), Derek O'Brien (TMC), Kanimozhi (DMK), Sandosh Kumar (CPI), Dharmendra Yadav (SP), N K Premachandran (RSP), Sanjay Raut (Sena UBT), Rajaram Singh (CPI-ML) among others, Kharge merely announced the candidate's name, which was finalised during the discussions with allies through interlocutors Kharge, Venugopal and Jairam Ramesh late on Monday.The meeting on Monday remained inconclusive after DMK's nominee Mylswami Annadurai was objected to by TMC, which argued that the VP polls could not become a local Tamil Nadu affair, alluding to BJP's choice of C P Radhakrishnan. DMK did not press for it, sources said, in the interest of unity.But since the Trinamool brass was insistent on a non-political person, Congress is said to have recommended Reddy citing his judicial past and his strong social justice credentials. Sources said, none of the parties took a hard line on any issue to ensure that the rare unity in the anti-BJP axis was not broken. Kharge said, ""Whenever democracy and the Constitution are under attack, opposition parties unite to fight against it. ""CPI MP Sandosh Kumar said Reddy's nomination is an assertion that ""defence of the Constitution and democratic values is non-negotiable"", underlining Reddy is ""an eminent jurist whose record in upholding human rights and civil liberties is impeccable"".AICC data analytics department chairman Praveen Chakravarty posted photographs of working with Reddy, who was chairman of the expert group on Telangana caste survey that concluded recently.The opposition choice is also a political trap for Andhra-Telangana parties aligned with BJP, as opposition will try to embarrass YSRCP and TDP who are supporting Radhakrishnan. At the same time, BJP's Telangana MPs will have to manage a tightrope as ""Reddy is a known name in the state"". It is the same issue of optics that BJP through Radhakrishnan is seeking to foist on DMK, which is in the opposition camp.","Former supreme court judge b sudershan reddy to take on nda's c p radhakrishnan.

Twenty proposers and as many supporters are expected to join him when he does so.

3 statute amendment bills today

Ministers facing

criminal charges

hinder good governance, says Shah

NEW DELHI: In a significant move, home minister Amit Shah will on Wednesday move a set of three bills providing for mandatory resignation or removal of the Prime Minister, chief ministers and ministers at the Centre and in states/UTs, if they have spent 30 consecutive days under arrest or detention, on an allegation of committing offences punishable with imprisonment extending to five years or more.However, nothing will prevent such PM, CMs or ministers from being subsequently appointed to the same office by President or governor, upon their release from custody.The timing of the amendments, two days before the end of Parliament's Monsoon session, and their implications caught political circles by surprise. The Representation of the People's Act, 1951 provides for the disqualification of members of state legislatures and Parliament if they are convicted with a sentence of two years or more. Convictions for serious offences such as corruption and drug trafficking result in disqualification irrespective of the duration of the sentence.There was so far no bar on ministers holding on to their offices after their arrests: something that was justified on the ground that no one deserves to be punished until proven guilty. Until a few years ago, ministers and CMs facing arrests, resigned. But the convention was of late followed more in breach with several ministers continuing in their posts after their arrests.The SC recently sought to reinstate the practice by forcing Tamil Nadu minister Senthil Balaji to step down.Shah, in the statement of objects and reasons of the bills, says the elected representatives, who represent hopes and aspirations of the people, are expected to act only in public interest and have character and conduct that is beyond any ray of suspicion.A minister, who is facing allegations of serious criminal offences, arrested and detained in custody, may thwart or hinder the canons of constitutional morality and principles of good governance and eventually diminish the constitutional trust reposed by people in him, Union minister Amit Shah said. The bills may be sent to a parliamentary panel for detailed scrutiny of provisions.The Constitution (One Hundred and Thirtieth Amendment) Bill states the PM, if under arrest or detention for 30 days on allegation of committing an offence punishable with jail term that may extend to five years or more, shall tender his resignation by the 31st day. ""If he does not tender his resignation, he shall cease to be PM with effect from the day falling thereafter,"" it adds.The same provisions will apply in case of a state or UT CM - the latter covered by two separate bills, Govt of Union Territories (Amendment) Bill, 2025 and Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Act, 2025 - arrested for a straight 30 days for an offence carrying a prison sentence of five years or more.Even the ministers in the Council of States at Centre and in states/UTs will be bound by the same provisions. While a Union minister shall be removed from office by the President on advice of the PM, state or UT ministers shall be removed by the governor on advice of the CM.In recent past, then Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had refused to resign after he was arrested in a liquor 'scam' case and spent several months in jail. It was only after he was let out on bail that he stepped down and named Atishi as CM.","Home minister amit shah will on wednesday move a set of three bills providing for mandatory resignation or removal of the prime minister, chief ministers and ministers at the centre and in states/uts.
