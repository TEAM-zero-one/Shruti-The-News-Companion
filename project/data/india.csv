'Justice Is Crying...': Mamata Banerjee Takes EC Head On In Supreme Court Over SIR Row In Bengal

Observing that a govt must behave as a ‘model employer’ and lack of funds cannot be a ground to deny its employees their dues, Supreme Court Thursday directed West Bengal govt to pay dearness allowance (DA) to its employees for the 2008-19 period.A bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and Prashant Kumar Mishra ordered that the first instalment should be paid by March 31 and appointed a committee, comprising its former judge Indu Malhotra, former chief justice of Jharkhand HC Tarlok Singh Chauhan, former HC judge Goutam Bhaduri and Comptroller and Auditor General of India, to monitor implementation of its order.SC rejected Bengal govt’s defence it lacked funds and said it is not open for the State to shirk its responsibility of paying DA on account of financial difficulty, given that it is an obligation arising out of a statute of its own creation.“It has often been recognised that the State must set an example for other employers in the country by behaving as a ‘model employer’. Such a position should not be difficult to attain given all the advantages that it has. Its power lies in the volume of employment, its sovereign/constitutional authority to tax, ability to borrow and manage public finances... Leading by example, fulfilling its financial duties in times of fiscal strain, gives it the moral authority to wield the sword of law against private entities, should they not do so.SC said the least that is expected of a State in a democracy is that it honours its obligations and commitments arising from a legislation or judicial decisions, for such obligations are not discretionary.“This clear position protects such statutory obligations, for if such a ground of limited financial ability was readily available to govt, which may undoubtedly in certain situations face tough times, it would render these obligations illusory. When it comes to employees’ dues, this proposition would be extremely dangerous and stifling since the amounts received thereby are not handouts or acts of charity but are earned compensation/consideration for services given,” it said.",West bengal govt ordered to pay dearness allowance (da) to its employees for the 2008-19 period. Justices sanjay karol and prashant kumar mishra ordered that the first instalment should be paid by march 31.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127962101,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-118330,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Sunetra Pawar To Be Named NCP Leader, Dy CM Oath Likely Tomorrow: Chhagan Bhujbal

PUNE: After Sharad Pawar took charge of steering the ship for his family following the death of his nephew Ajit Pawar, its members on Thursday backed deputy chief minister Sunetra Pawar’s name as NCP’s national president. While some other senior NCP functionaries showed reluctance for a merger with NCP (SP), the Pawar family said Sunetra would speak about it on behalf of her party.Interacting with reporters in Baramati, NCP (SP) state general secretary and Ajit Pawar’s nephew Rohit Pawar said: “As the Pawar family, we also wish that after taking charge as deputy CM, Sunetra Kaki (aunt) should be the next NCP chief.” On the issue of merger, he said there had been no discussion so far in the family. “We will take it up after the mourning period as it is important to know the members’ opinions. Since Sunetra Kaki (aunt) has taken charge as deputy CM and all NCP MLAs support her, she will speak on the merger after Feb 9. We can then discuss it thereafter.”Possibility of a re-unification grew stronger after Pawar Senior took the lead to minimise tension within the family when he went to meet Sunetra and her sons at their Baramati residence for the second consecutive day on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court has held as invalid prohibition on transfer or migration of a medical student from one college to another, and has directed National Medical Commission to formulate a “proper policy” to permit migration.A division bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyaya and Justice Tejas Karia zeroed in on Regulation 18 of the Graduate Medical Education Regulation, 2023, and termed it “unreasonable and arbitrary”, and violating the Constitution.The bench was dealing with a petition by a medical student with 40% visual impairment who sought migration from Govt Medical College, Barmer to a college in Delhi. The court directed NMC to take a decision within three weeks on the petitioner’s transfer request.“What we find is that in the name of maintaining uniformity, standard and integrity in the matter of medical education across the institutions, total prohibition on transfer or migration of a student, need of which may occur in various situations, including the one which arose in this case, cannot be said to be reasonable; rather, in our opinion, such prohibition is manifestly unreasonable and arbitrary,” the high couty said in its order on Feb 4.The bench observed NMC’s stand that migration was prone to misuse could not be sustained, as the possibility of abuse could not be used to deny legitimate rights to a citizen.The court noted that the medical condition and capabilities of the petitioner were worsening on account of the harsh climate in Barmer, and the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act mandated public bodies to ensure that persons with disabilities (PWDs) were provided “reasonable accommodation” and an “appropriate environment”. Provisions enacted by Parliament, the court said, cannot remain only a decorative and admirable piece of literature kept on a bookshelf.The judges further observed that NMC’s stand that the petitioner was aware of the weather conditions in Barmer before joining a college there was “nothing short of rubbing salt into the wounds”.","The delhi high court has held as invalid prohibition on transfer or migration of a medical student from one college to another.

Trial courts across the country continued to impose death penalty in significant numbers in 2025 even as appellate courts set aside or modified most of these sentences, raising “serious concerns about the reliability of convictions in capital cases”, finds an annual study by The Square Circle Clinic — a criminal justice initiative of NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad.From 2016 to 2025, trial courts imposed 1,310 death sentences but high courts confirmed only 106, according to ‘Death Penalty in India: Annual Statistics Report 2025’ released on Feb 4. Of the death sentences confirmed by HCs, Supreme Court decided a little over a half of them and upheld none, shows the report.The data points to a persistent gap between trial court sentencing and appellate outcomes. As of Dec 31 last year, 574 prisoners were on death row which the report described as “the largest number of persons on death row at the end of a calendar year since 2016”.In this backdrop, sessions courts sentenced 128 people to death across 94 cases in 2025, finds the study.In 2025 alone, HCs acquitted, commuted, remanded or recorded abatement in most of the death sentence cases they decided, and SC’s record reflects a similar pattern, shows the report. The study finds that the apex court has not confirmed a single death sentence in 2023-2025, even where HCs had initially upheld them.In 2025 alone, high courts acquitted 35 individuals across 22 cases. SC acquitted accused in more than half the cases it decided, recording the highest number of death row acquittals — 10 persons — in the past decade.“The frequency with which death sentences are overturned at the appellate stage raises serious concerns about the reliability of convictions in capital cases,” the report states.Those acquitted by HCs spent an average of 5.17 years on death row, with several remaining under death sentence for close to two decades before being exonerated.“High rates of acquittals from death row expose a deep fracture in the criminal legal system,” said Shreya Rastogi, director, litigation and forensics at The Square Circle Clinic. “When more than a third of HC confirmation cases result in acquittals, it indicates failures in investigation and prosecution that harm victims and accused alike. These errors cost people decades of their lives and freedom.”The failures identified by the report are spread across the criminal justice process, said Maitreyi Misra, director, research and mitigation, The Square Circle Clinic. “Supreme Court itself has repeatedly pointed out failures at multiple levels — investigation agencies, prosecution and lower courts — while acquitting people on death row,” she said.","From 2016 to 2025, trial courts imposed 1,310 death sentences but high courts confirmed only 106.

Major ordeal for travellers

Ripple effects on transport

(With inputs from George Mendonca in Mumbai)





PUNE: Thousands of commuters of all ages and backgrounds had a harrowing time for several hours as traffic on the Pune-Mumbai expressway was disrupted for at least 32 hours after a tanker carrying highly flammable propylene overturned near the Adoshi Tunnel on the Mumbai-bound carriageway around 4.45pm on Tuesday.The accident occurred around 50m ahead of the tunnel in the Borghat stretch, which falls in the Khandala ghat section of Raigad district.Also read: Could the 13-km ‘missing link’ on Pune–Mumbai Expressway have prevented 32-hour jam? Soon, gas began leaking from the damaged tanker. Strong safety concerns immediately prompted the halting of vehicular traffic on the stretch towards Mumbai and on the side towards Pune for a few hours, leading to a logjam spanning several kilometres and leaving commuters hapless all night and through most of Wednesday. It was only around 10.30pm on Wednesday that the transfer of gas from the damaged tanker to a new one was finished, the highway police said. Around midnight, they estimated that after removal of the damaged vehicle with a crane, and the corridor towards Mumbai was likely to reopen after 1am on Thursday.Stranded travellers included children, senior citizens and patients heading to Mumbai for treatment.Among those trapped was 57-year-old Sunita Patil. Her son, Aadesh, told TOI that his brother, Sandesh, rode a two-wheeler — despite two-wheelers being barred on the expressway — from Kharghar in Navi Mumbai to the accident site around 1am on Wednesday to extricate her as she was stuck in traffic without food for over seven hours.""She is a senior citizen and there was no food or water available on the expressway, so we could not leave her there alone. We were informed that the issue was likely to continue until morning,"" he said.Also read: Mumbai–Pune Expressway turns into highway prison: Trapped industrialist escapes hours of chaos by chopper A similar nightmare was faced by a commuter from Latur travelling with a cancer patient. ""I was taking my friend to Mumbai for treatment and we had an appointment with the doctor at 8am, but we could not reach the hospital due to the road closure,"" he said.Wasim Joad, a resident of Vimannagar, took a U-turn from the food mall near the Urse toll plaza after he received information about the heavy congestion ahead towards Mumbai. ""I returned to Pune and travelled to Mumbai via Tamhini Ghat. Though the journey was longer, I reached the destination as it was important,"" he said.Some were lucky to find out about the jam in advance, and cancelled their trips. Pune Camp resident Sushil Poddar said he came to know just as he was about to board a bus from Swargate on Wednesday morning. ""Many people, including drivers, were talking about the jam. I then found out via social media that the situation is critical. Though I had an important meeting in Mumbai, I nixed my trip,"" the business executive said.Officials said the tanker overturned as the driver could not control the speed on the slope near the tunnel. It was damaged at three spots on the valve, after which the leakage started. Although rescue teams — including NDRF, BPCL, officials from the state disaster management and the fire brigade — rushed to the spot, the leakage could not be stopped. Finally, a team of chemical experts was called to the site.A highway police official said the movement of vehicles towards Mumbai was completely stopped until Wednesday morning, while vehicles were slowly allowed to travel towards Pune. Tanaji Chikhale, the highway superintendent of police (SP), told TOI that one of the three lanes from the Pune carriageway side was opened for vehicles moving towards Mumbai on Wednesday by opening the median barrier.He said, ""We urged people planning to travel to Mumbai to take alternate routes via Tamhini Ghat, Malshej Ghat or Bhimashankar to reach their destinations, while heavy vehicles were advised to park in lay-bys or food malls until the gas leak was neutralised.""The movement of light vehicles was also diverted via Khopoli from the Magic Point on the expressway. Chikhale said the entry of vehicles was also stopped at the entry point on the expressway near Kiwale in Pimpri Chinchwad.Bhalchandra Chavan, director of state disaster management, told TOI that the tanker belonged to Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) and was headed from Kochi in Kerala to Dahej in Gujarat. Referring to the delay in bringing the situation under control, Chavan said it was BPCL's responsibility to deploy its recovery van to plug the leakage, but the response came only the next morning, leading to a critical delay.""We held a meeting with BPCL officials today and sought an explanation. As per their version, the nearest company registered on their system was required to respond, following which a team of experts from Deepak Phenolics Ltd was rushed to the site. However, the team could not successfully plug the multiple leakages,"" Chavan said.BPCL officials offered a different account of events. A senior BPCL official told TOI that the company could not immediately send its recovery van as it was stationed at the Kochi refinery at the time of the accident. ""The expert team failed to arrest minor leakages in the tanker. Therefore, it was decided to de-contain the gas into other tankers to prevent escalation of risk. The tanker underwent mandatory checks before induction and was suitable for carrying the gas. The leakage occurred due to the accident, not any apparent design flaw. Nevertheless, this will be examined in the investigation,"" the official said.BPCL's Health, Safety, Security and Environment (HSSE) branch will conduct a detailed probe into the incident and recommend corrective measures. ""The team will also ascertain the exact causes behind the accident,"" he added.Senior inspector of Khopoli police station Sachin Hire said, ""If there was an explosion due to gas leakage, it would have been a major disaster for 2-3km. On Wednesday evening, the gas was transferred to another tanker under supervision of chemical experts and the cooling process of the overturned tanker was carried out. Once the overturned tanker's cooling process is completed, it will be towed away using hydraulic crane. ""Hire added, ""An FIR has been registered against the tanker driver, identified as Ratan Singh Uday Narayan (44) from Uttar Pradesh, who suffered minor injuries. He has been booked under sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) and Motor Vehicles Act for rash and negligent driving on a public way and endangering life and personal safety of others.""Raigad SP Aanchal Dalal told TOI, ""We registered an accident report. Currently, we are busy with the rescue operation and appropriate legal action, if any, will be decided later.""The expressway's partial closure also disrupted MSRTC services, forcing cancellation of 139 bus trips. MSRTC PRO Abhijeet Bhosale said that, besides cancellations, at least 163 buses from various depots, particularly those from Western Maharashtra and the Konkan region, were affected. ""Keeping passenger safety as our priority, alternative arrangements were made. Bus services will be normalised once the situation improves,"" he said.Arun Siya, the divisional controller of MSRTC Pune division, called the issue critical. ""The buses coming from Mumbai to Pune are also affected. We don't quite know by when the situation will turn normal,"" he said.Santosh Bogre, a senior official with the Swargate depot, said buses were released until 9am before being completely stopped, as 16 buses that left for their destinations were stranded on the highway. ""We came to know from many passengers that the buses which went towards Mumbai at 6am ended up getting stuck on the expressway even after noon. Many passengers called and complained to us about the mess and hence we stopped all Mumbai operations until the situation on the highway becomes normal,"" Barge said.Similarly, an official with Shivajinagar depot said that no buses from the Pune station depot had gone to Mumbai. ""From Pune station depot, around 25 buses go to several places in Mumbai each day and all trips have been cancelled. The authorities needed to inform us earlier via any means so that the coordination could have better,"" he pointed out.Balasaheb Khedekar, president of the Pune District Luxury Bus Owners Association, said around 50 private buses from Pune, and also from other places, going towards Mumbai, were stuck on the expressway. ""There has been an advisory issued that one can use the Tamhini Ghat. However, the buses won't have that way because of the risks and also that the alternative road will obviously get jammed,"" Khedekar said.Railway officials also said that intercity trains between Pune and Mumbai saw heavy crowding on Wednesday. ""The number of passengers was more than usual. Though we don't have figures, the crowd on all the trains including the Deccan Queen, Deccan Express, Pragati Express, Intercity Express and others was higher,"" an official said.",A tanker carrying highly flammable propylene overturned near the adoshi tunnel on the mumbai-bound carriageway around 4.45pm on tuesday.

GHAZIABAD: Three girls, half-sisters who spent every waking moment together, were found dead next to each other on the premises of Bharat City in Ghaziabad, directly under a bedroom window of their ninth-floor flat. The tragedy unfolded around 2am on Wednesday, according to Bharat City resident Arun Kumar, who told TOI he saw the three girls fall. The sisters were 16, 14 and 12 years old.According to Kumar's account, the eldest girl sat on the window with her back to the compound. The two other girls stood in front of her, hugging her tightly. Suddenly, the girl on the window leaned back and fell to the ground.

The note had both an apology - 'Sorry Papa' - and instructions to him to read their diary - 'READ NOW'.The diary, which TOI has seen, reveals that the girls had a deep obsession for all things 'K' (Korean), from pop to BL (boy love) dramas to culture, and despised their father for opposing it. ""Sorry papa, Korea was our life. How did you even dare to take this from us?"" reads a line in the diary.Also read: Ghaziabad sisters’ suicide: ‘Death would be better than beatings,’ daughters wrote in diary; father deep in debt Police sources said this could be a reference to their father Chetan Kumar, a stock trader allegedly deep in debt, taking away the elder daughter's phone 15 days ago and selling it.Chetan did not deny the girls' K-obsession. ""They listened to Korean music, watched Korean films, dramas, web series and cartoons. They also wanted to go to Korea. All three girls wanted us to accept Korean culture, but when we refused, their behaviour towards us changed and they went into a shell. They lived in their own world,"" he said.Chetan said he was asleep in an adjacent room and woke up hearing screams in the house. There were five children in the house. According to police, Chetan lives with three women who are sisters and claims to have married all of them. The eldest girl who died and a younger boy were from his first wife, who he married 18 years ago. The 14- and 12-year-old girls who died were from her younger sister, and a four-year-old girl, referred to as 'Devu' in the girls' diary, was from his wife's youngest sister.Also read: No school since Covid, 16-year-old remained in Class 4: Ghaziabad sisters stayed away from society play areas too The tipping point for the girls, according to the note, was their attempt to initiate 'Devu' into their K-world being rebuffed by the parents and their younger sibling taking to Bollywood instead.Nimish Patil, DCP of Trans-Hindon, said Sachin called 112 police helpline. Police took the girls to a hospital where doctors declared them dead on arrival.""Our initial investigation shows the girls were sleeping with their mother in a room while Chetan was sleeping with his son. Around 1.45am, the girls woke each other up and went to the kitchen on the pretext of having water. But they went to the puja room and locked the door from inside. They used a plastic stool to climb to the window. Their mother woke up and asked them to open the door, but they did not respond. According to Chetan, the two other girls were still in the room when he woke up to find the eldest girl lying on the compound. The two other daughters also jumped after that,"" Patil said.A police field unit broke the door of the puja room and found childhood photographs of the three girls strewn across the floor along with a mobile phone and the pocket-sized diary that they instructed their father to read.""The girls took the mobile phone of their mother before going to the puja room. We have sent it to a forensic team for investigation,"" Patil said, adding there were frequent spats in the house over the girls obsessing about Korea.""It's likely that they wrote the diary one or two days ago after a heated exchange with their father,"" a police officer said.","Three girls, aged 16, 14 and 12, were found dead next to each other on the premises of bharat city in ghaziabad. A one-page note they left for their father hinted at the turbulent state of mind of the girls, who did not go to school. The girls had a deep obsession for all things 'k' (korean) and despised their father for opposing it.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127921099,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1128108,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
Married woman can’t claim rape on false marriage promise: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/married-woman-cant-claim-rape-on-false-marriage-promise-supreme-court/articleshow/127955508.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over misuse of the criminal justice system by filing of rape cases when a consenting relationship turns sour, Supreme Court on Thursday held that a married woman who gets into a physical relationship with another man cannot file a rape case against him on the ground that she got into the sexual relationship on the promise of marriage.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan said in such cases, a woman was not eligible to get married due to the subsistence of her marriage and she could not invoke the ground of false promise of marriage. It passed the order while quashing criminal proceedings against a lawyer on a complaint filed by a woman advocate alleging that he had raped her on the false promise of marriage.The court said the complainant was already married when they were in a relationship and it was “a classic case of a consensual relationship turning acrimonious”.“Therefore, even for the sake of argument, if the contention is accepted that there indeed was a false promise of marriage based on which the accused indulged in sexual activities, such a promise would not be legally enforceable or even capable of being acted upon as the victim herself was not eligible for marriage, neither on the date of the first alleged act of offence nor on any subsequent dates wherein the parties indulged in sexual activities, till the point of the date of registration of FIR.The said embargo arises from sub-clause (i) of Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, which categorically prohibits marriage between two individuals if either of them have a living spouse,” the bench observed.The bench said courts have to be extremely careful in identifying genuine rape cases by looking for the essential ingredients to constitute the said offence in view of the law being misused today.","A married woman who gets into a physical relationship with another man cannot file a rape case against him on the ground that she got into the sexual relationship on the promise of marriage.

Arrest mere statutory discretion to facilitate investigation, says the top court

NEW DELHI: Noting that an arrest can’t be made simply because it is lawful for the police officer to do so, SC on Thursday held that an investigating agency should not take an accused into custody for asking questions and the same should be done only when it is necessary for the probe.Enumerating various sections of the newly enacted Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and N K Singh said a notice under Section 35(3) of the law to an accused or any individual concerned, qua offences punishable with imprisonment of up to 7 years, is the rule.“The power of arrest under Section 35(6) read with Section 35(1)(b) of the BNSS, 2023 must be interpreted as a strict objective necessity, and not a subjective convenience for the police officer. It does not mean the police officer can arrest to simply ask questions,” the bench said.Senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, told the court the requirement to issue a notice under Section 35(3) is absolute and cannot be bypassed solely by recording reasons for arrest.“Suffice it is to state that an investigation can go on even without an arrest.While undertaking the exercise of collecting the evidence for the purpose of forming his opinion over the commission of a cognizable offence, a police officer shall pose a question, to himself, on the necessity of an arrest. This safeguard is provided as, in any case, the power to arrest an accused person is always available with a police officer even after he records his reasons, in writing, for not doing so at an earlier stage,” the bench said.“On the basis of the interpretation given by us, we conclude as follows: An arrest by a police officer is a mere statutory discretion which facilitates him to conduct proper investigation, in the form of collection of evidence and, therefore, shall not be termed as mandatory. Consequently, the police officer shall ask himself the question as to whether an arrest is a necessity or not, before undertaking the said exercise,” it said.“...Even if the circumstances warranting an arrest of a person are available in terms of the conditions mentioned under Section 35(1)(b) of the BNSS, 2023, the arrest shall not be undertaken, unless it’s absolutely warranted,” it said.","Sc says an investigating agency should not take an accused into custody for asking questions. The same should be done only when it is necessary for the probe, the court said. A notice under section 35(3) of the law to an accused or any individual concerned is the rule.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127956474,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-112268,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In a rare development in Parliament Thursday, standoff between treasury and opposition benches in Lok Sabha became a subject of debate in Rajya Sabha as leader of opposition in RS Mallikarjun Kharge attacked the governing alliance for allegedly not allowing Rahul Gandhi to speak in the Lower House.Kharge’s reference to LS proceedings drew a sharp response from BJP , with Leader of the House in RS JP Nadda mocking Rahul as “abodh balak (ignorant child)” and reminding Kharge that events of one House cannot be debated in another.However, Congress chief Kharge insisted that as both Houses are pillars of democracy, he was raising the issue in the Upper House as LS was not functioning for the past four days because its LoP, Rahul, was not being allowed to speak. Opposition members staged a walkout over the issue from Rajya Sabha.Nadda asked Kharge not to let Congress become “hostage” to Rahul and said arrogance and ignorance should not dictate actions.

NEW DELHI: Even as new roads, hospitals and schools are promised for the Northeast, more than Rs 3,200 crore meant for infrastructure projects in the region is still lying unspent — a reality check that surfaced in the Parliament on Thursday.Replying to a question in Rajya Sabha, minister of state for development of north eastern region Sukanta Majumdar said ongoing projects under the North East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme (NESIDS) carry an outstanding central liability of Rs 3,206.18 crore as of Dec 31, 2025. There are over 160 projects still under implementation.State-wise figures show Assam topping the list with Rs 1,012.87 crore pending across 35 projects, followed by Manipur (Rs 441.38 crore), Nagaland (Rs 406.09 crore) and Arunachal Pradesh (Rs 395.37 crore). Other states with large unpaid amounts include Tripura (Rs 308.71 crore), Mizoram (Rs 275.81 crore), Meghalaya (Rs 258.05 crore) and Sikkim (Rs 107.90 crore).Sector-wise, roads and bridges account for the biggest backlog of Rs 1,402.11 crore across 53 projects. Education projects have pending dues of Rs 774.55 crore, while Rs 317.87 crore is yet to be spent on health infrastructure. Power, water supply, sports, tourism, digital connectivity and civil aviation together make up the rest of the outstanding amount.The govt also told the House that 30 projects — three under NESIDS (Roads) and 27 under NESIDS (Other Than Roads Infrastructure) — were sanctioned more than two years ago but still have over 50% of their approved cost unspent. Officials attributed the delays to tough terrain, land issues, statutory clearances and financial closures, saying timelines often depend on local conditions.NESIDS was launched in 2017–18 and later split into two components — roads and other infrastructure — to support projects ranging from highways and bridges to schools, hospitals, water supply and solid waste management. States select projects based on local priorities, while fund allocation is guided by factors such as population, area, road density, hospital beds and access to drinking water.","Assam tops the list with rs 1,012.87 crore pending across 35 projects.

calls for shutdown in Kuki-Zo areas

GUWAHTI: Around a dozen protesters were wounded in a clash with security forces in Manipur’s Churachandpur Thursday as initial resentment within the Kuki-Zo community over its MLA Nemcha Kipgen agreeing to be a deputy CM in the reinstated NDA government snowballed into a backlash.The influential Kuki Zo Council declared a social boycott of any legislator from the community joining CM Yumnam Khemchand Singh’s govt.Protesters burned tyres and blocked roads in Kangpokpi district, and at least one group called for a shutdown in the hills.Nemcha Kipgen, who took the oath of office Wednesday over videoconferencing from Delhi’s Manipur Bhawan, is one of two tribal understudies to CM Khemchand Singh alongside Naga MLA Losii Dikho.KZC views Kipgen’s consent as “defiance of a collective mandate” not to be part of the govt until the Centre acknowledges the community’s long-standing demand for administrative separation from the Meitei-majority Imphal Valley.Joint Forum of Seven (JF7), a group of Kuki freedom fighters within Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s Azad Hind Fauz, called for a total shutdown on Friday across the state’s Kuki Zo-majority areas.A protest rally has been planned in Churachandpur.In Kangpokpi, roads littered with burning tyres signalled a return to unrest after a period of relative calm across the hills. The armed Kuki Liberation Army issued a “clear and final warning” that any Kuki Zo representative joining the govt would be deemed to have betrayed the community.Complicating the situation, Thadou Inpi Manipur took the opposite stand, congratulating Kipgen on what it termed her “historic appointment as the first Thadou tribal” to hold the office of deputy CM. It urged her to “ fearlessly and unequivocally reject Kuki identity” and dissociate herself from “separatist agendas”.

Forging alliance

What political pundits say

Why caste matters in Tamil Nadu

Dalits

Thevars

Vanniyars

Gounders

NEW DELHI: As Tamil Nadu gears up for assembly elections in a couple months, the BJP is looking to consolidate opposition forces. With an anti-DMK alliance, the BJP, it seems is also trying to ""do a Bihar"" in a state it has struggled to make a mark in till now.As the party takes winning lessons from recent Bihar assembly victory, it is forming a social alliance that represents every major caste segment in the state.Earlier in Bihar assembly election, BJP had a fool-proof plan. The party, along with its NDA partners, built a social coalition that represented the major castes, isolating the Rashtriya Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan with its Muslim-Yadav voter base.The five NDA partners represented almost all segments of society. LJP and HAM had Dalit faces like Union minister Chirag Paswan and Jitan Ram Manjhi. EBC and non-Yadav OBC castes were represented by JD(U) and the Rashtriya Lok Morcha. Meanwhile, the BJP had its vote banks among the upper castes and the Baniya community.This fine-tuned caste coalition brought an overwhelming majority for the NDA. The alliance won 202 seats in the 243-member Bihar Assembly.Dominated by Dravidian politics, alliances also play a huge role in Tamil Nadu. Apart from a peak DMK or AIADMK , no single party can dominate the Assembly without a broad coalition.To prevent vote-splitting, which could favour the DMK, the BJP is trying to inculcate as many parties as it can to rebuild a broader NDA. Former alliance partners and breakaway factions are being approached, including leaders who had earlier left.Two years after the split, the BJP and AIADMK came together in 2025 and announced that the NDA will contest the upcoming assembly polls under the leadership of former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami (EPS).The BJP’s alliance with the AIADMK has been more than tactical and is seen in Delhi as the primary vehicle for relevance in the southern state. However, the current BJP strategy, curated mainly by Amit Shah, reflects this urgency.Additionally, the AIADMK also has a voter base among Dalit communities. This voter base constitutes almost 20 per cent of the state’s population.Meanwhile, AIADMK leader O Panneerselvam (OPS) also declared that he was “ready” for reunification with Edappadi K Palaniswami’s (EPS) AIADMK faction ahead of Tamil Nadu’s 2026 assembly polls.At a press meet in Madurai, OPS threw a pointed challenge at both EPS and AMMK general secretary T T V Dhinakaran, asking whether they were prepared to take the leap. “I am ready for that. Are they ready?” he said, invoking the possibility of rival factions closing ranks under the NDA umbrella.The Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) also entered the NDA, giving it a symbolic boost. However, this did not come without complications. Anbumani Ramadoss’s decision to align with the AIADMK-BJP front was meant to strengthen the NDA’s presence in northern Tamil Nadu, where the PMK traditionally draws support from the Vanniyar community. Though this adds social breadth to the coalition at a time when consolidation is critical, the PMK is far from united.Meanwhile, the BJP has also reportedly approached TVK’s Vijay to join the NDA after he positioned his party as an alternative political force in Tamil Nadu.Vijay hails from a Christian community that constitutes about 6 per cent of the population in the state. Additionally, Vijay commands huge popularity among youngsters. Unlike the parties of other film stars, Vijay’s supporters are organised and politically active.According to poll analysts, caste equations have always played a role in Tamil Nadu. However, they believe the BJP’s efforts to bring different castes on one stage have not gained much traction.Speaking to The Times of India, political analyst Kannan R said that the saffron party does have a number of leaders from the backward classes but so far, the party seems to rally Hindus as a monolithic unit.“Caste and cash remain two important factors in TN’s electoral politics and will continue to play a crucial role. I don’t think the BJP is trying to bring different castes on the stage, or if it is, it hasn’t gained traction so far,” Kannan said.“It does have a number of leaders from the backward classes, but so far the party seems to rally Hindus as a monolithic unit, which has so far been a no-go in this state,” he added.Another analyst, Shyam Shanmugaa, said that elections cannot be won purely on caste equations in Tamil Nadu.“Caste equations are always at play in rural Tamil Nadu. But in urban areas, it does not matter. Tamil Nadu is a heavily urbanised state. Hence, elections cannot be won purely on caste equations. If one caste is mobilised in a particular rural constituency, counter-mobilisation takes place,” Shanmugaa told TOI.“Therefore, winning chances are there for candidates who are caste-neutral and appeal to all castes. The BJP is mostly seen as a Brahmin upper-caste party. It is unable to mobilise one particular OBC caste. Even when TN BJP leaders from particular dominant communities were made state presidents, the BJP could not win,” he added.Dalits constitute around 19% to 21% of the state’s population. They are spread across the state, with their population higher in districts such as Cuddalore, Villupuram, Tiruvallur and Madurai.The larger Dravidian political movement, which has evolved over the past two centuries and given rise to parties such as the Dravida Kazhagam, the DMK and the AIADMK, has historically reached out to Dalits.Concentrated mainly in southern Tamil Nadu districts such as Madurai, Theni, Dindigul, Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram, the Thevars are a politically influential community and fall under the MBC category. Several prominent Thevar leaders are part of the AIADMK.Former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s close aide V K Sasikala and rebel leader O Panneerselvam both belong to the community.The Thevar population is estimated at around 10% to 12%.Vanniyars, largely based in northern Tamil Nadu, are among the biggest and most politically active Most Backward Classes (MBCs) in the state. Tamil Nadu categorises OBCs into BC and MBC groups. The Vanniyars are primarily an agrarian community and have largely retained land ownership despite industrialisation. Members of the community are frequently named in connection with anti-Dalit violence in the state.Politically, Vanniyars are represented by the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), which is currently part of the BJP-led NDA. Founded and led by S Ramadoss, the party has wielded influence due to the community’s numerical strength, organisational structure and sustained political mobilisation. Ramadoss began organising Vanniyars in the 1980s and is credited with improving educational outcomes within the community from the 1990s onwards.Vanniyars are estimated to make up about 12% to 15% of Tamil Nadu’s population, with a strong presence in Villupuram, Cuddalore, Thiruvannamalai and parts of Vellore, and smaller concentrations in Salem and Dindigul.Nadars are a trading community with a strong footprint in commerce and politics. Their leaders cut across party lines and have successfully translated economic strength into political influence.The most prominent Nadar leader in Tamil Nadu’s political history is K Kamaraj, a senior Congress leader and former chief minister. Alongside Hindu Nadars, Christian Nadars also hold a significant presence in institutions and power structures.The community’s population is estimated at around 4% to 6%, with a concentration in southern Tamil Nadu districts such as Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Virudhunagar.Gounders fall under the Backward Classes category and account for roughly 5% to 7% of Tamil Nadu’s population. They are largely concentrated in western Tamil Nadu, or the Kongu Nadu region, which includes districts such as Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Erode, Namakkal, Karur and Salem.Primarily dependent on agriculture and allied sectors, the community is also known for its entrepreneurial presence and influence in regional industries. Prominent figures include industrialist and philanthropist N Mahalingam, who was involved in several educational initiatives.After J Jayalalithaa’s death, Edappadi K Palaniswami, a Gounder, assumed control of the AIADMK, sidelining the Sasikala family and O Panneerselvam, and assigning key Cabinet portfolios to leaders from the community.The Election Commission is expected to announce the assembly elections in Tamil Nadu in April–May this year. In the 2021 assembly elections, the DMK won 133 seats, while the Congress won 18 seats. Meanwhile, the AIADMK secured 66 seats with 33.5% of the vote; the PMK secured five seats with a 3.8% vote share, while the VCK won four seats with a 1% vote share.","The bjp is forming a social alliance that represents every major caste segment in the state.

Mamata Banerjee Takes SIR Battle Against Election Commission To Supreme Court, Openly Challenges BJP

KOLKATA: A new welfare scheme called ‘Banglar Yuba-Sathi’ for Bengal’s unemployed youth and a 50% hike in the payout to ‘Lakshmir Bhandar’ beneficiaries headlined the Mamata Banerjee govt’s last budget — a vote-on-account — before the state goes to polls later this year.Finance minister Chandrima Bhattacharya on Thursday had some cheer for state govt employees too, budgeting for a 4% hike in DA. Govt rechristened its Karmashree scheme as “Mahatma Shree” and hiked the minimum number of workdays from 75 to 100 in what is being seen as a nod to Trinamool Congress ’s opposition to the Centre’s decision to replace MGNREGA.Lakshmir Bhandar, Banerjee’s signature women-focused scheme launched before the 2021 assembly polls, will see monthly payouts increase from Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500. Bhattacharya also announced a Rs 1,000 increase in the monthly honorarium for ASHA and anganwadi workers, para-teachers and civic volunteers. Banerjee said the number of social welfare schemes had crossed a landmark. “We had 94 schemes. We just hit a century with the new ones. ”Economist and BJP MLA Ashok Lahiri termed the vote-on-account “more like the Trinamool manifesto” than a budget, saying it doesn’t account for additional funding required to pay higher DA to govt employees.",New welfare scheme called ‘banglar yuba-sathi’ for bengal’s unemployed youth.

MUMBAI: For years, teacher and artist Rouble Nagi has used walls in slums for creation of murals to teach children who seldom make it to classrooms. On Thursday, that work was recognised on a global stage when she won the $1 million Global Teacher Prize 2026 — world’s largest award for educators.It was presented at World Governments Summit in Dubai, an annual gathering of leaders and policymakers. Now in its tenth year, the prize — an initiative of Varkey Foundation along with Unesco — honours teachers whose work reshaped learning outcomes and communities.Nagi, who has developed pedagogy around art, began her work in the slums of Mumbai about a decade ago. Accepting the award, she said recognition of work rooted in “education, compassion, consistency and service” had strengthened her resolve to continue working with children on the margins.Through the Rouble Nagi Art Foundation, she has established over 800 learning centres in India, reaching children who have never attended school as well as those enrolled but struggling to keep pace. The focus is foundational literacy, numeracy and basic conceptual understanding in communities where formal schooling often fails to hold.Nagi is perhaps best known for her murals, which use colour, symbols and stories to impart lessons.Neglected spaces in settlements turn into open-air classrooms which teach language, science, mathematics and history. Art is central to her as a tool to instil confidence, heal and allow self expression.Starting out with a small, hands-on effort among families living in fragile conditions, Nagi Art Foundation has expanded to villages and various urban centres. The underlying belief, she said, is that inequality is not destiny, and that education delivered with dignity can bridge the gap between exclusion and opportunity. An educator who is inspired by the legacy of Savitribai Phule, Nagi said she has remained committed to education without discrimination.Under her Misaal India initiative, Nagi has also set up skill centres for women, helping them achieve financial independence and emerge as entrepreneurs.Sunny Varkey, founder of Global Teacher Prize and GEMS Education, said Nagi represented “the very best of what teaching can be — courage, creativity and compassion”. Francis Joseph, CEO of GEMS Education, said Nagi’s influence extended beyond conventional classrooms. Stefania Giannini, Unesco’s assistant director-general for education, said the award reaffirmed a “simple truth: teachers matter”.","Nagi is perhaps best known for her murals, which use colour, symbols and stories to impart lessons.

NEW DELHI: Speaker Om Birla disclosed in Lok Sabha on Thursday that it was at his request that PM Narendra Modi had decided not to come to Lok Sabha to reply to the President’s address, as he had concrete information that protesting opposition members standing near Modi’s designated seat could pull off some “unexpected act”.“Had such an unpleasant act happened, then its sight would have torn the country’s democratic traditions to shreds,” he said amid protests from opposition MPs.Modi’s scheduled reply to the Motion of Thanks on the President’s address was called off at last minute on Wednesday due to intense protest from opposition MPs, with some women members hovering near the PM’s seat ahead of his expected arrival.Many other members from Congress and regional parties were raising slogans in protest, including over BJP MP Nishikant Dubey’s reference to several books carrying uncharitable references to members of the Nehru-Gandhi family.Birla said, “The whole country watched the incident yesterday as to how some women members reached there. It was not in accordance with the House’s dignity.”Birla also made it clear to the Opposition the House will not function “either today or tomorrow” if they continue bringing posters and pamphlets inside and asked them to express their views in line with parliamentary traditions.With the discussion on the motion thwarted since Monday over LoP Rahul Gandhi ’s insistence on referring to an unpublished book written by former army chief M M Naravane and Birla disallowing it, Lok Sabha passed the motion with a voice vote without Modi’s reply, a first since the NDA regime began in 2014, though not without precedence.Birla also voiced disapproval of opposition members’ vocal protest at his office — an apparent reference to their show of displeasure over Dubey’s speech — and slammed it as a “black spot” in parliamentary conventions. It has never happened that MPs bring their political differences to the office of speaker in such a manner.“It is in no way appropriate that the leader of the House (PM) could not speak.” He thanked Modi for accepting his request aimed at maintaining the House’s dignity.Congress on Thursday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of seeking cover behind the Speaker as it rubbished the Chair’s statement that the PM had skipped his scheduled reply to the Motion of Thanks in Lok Sabha on Wednesday over fears that women MPs of Congress could trigger an unprecedented incident against the BJP mascot. It further said that Om Birla’s statement had been dictated by the Modi govt.Rahul Gandhi said, “Modi was so scared of the truth that he sought refuge in lies. Khair, jo uchit samjha, woh kiya (anyway, he did what he felt appropriate)” — the remark in Hindi being a sarcastic reference to what General MM Naravane has said was the PM’s stand during the Chinese aggression.Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said, “They are making the Speaker say all this because yesterday he (PM) did not have the guts to come to the house. Because three women were standing in front of his bench?”Priyanka asked what was so strange if women MPs were standing in front of the treasury benches. “There is no question of anyone raising any hand on the PM or trying to hurt him or any such thing. There is no question. It is an absolute lie.”With the ruling BJP castigating the Opposition for stalling PM Modi’s speech on the President’s address, Congress spokesman Jairam Ramesh recalled that on June 10, 2004, then PM Manmohan Singh was prevented by BJP from speaking on the Motion of Thanks. Ramesh posted on X Singh’s reply to the Motion of Thanks on March 10, 2005, where Singh starts his speech by saying that he had “waited out an entire year to perform this happy task” and thanked the President for the address of both 2004 and 2005.Ramesh said, “...we needed to put it on record that UPA PM Manmohan Singh was not allowed by the BJP to reply to the motion of thanks in 2004 even though the house had concluded the discussion on the motion, and only Singh’s reply remained.”","Lok sabha speaker om birla said he had concrete information that protesting opposition members standing near pm's designated seat could pull off some “unexpected act” “had such an unpleasant act happened, then its sight would have torn the country’s democratic traditions to shreds,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127960302,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-202978,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
