"Dalai's brother, champion of the Tibet cause, and thukpa",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dalais-brother-champion-of-the-tibet-cause-and-thukpa/articleshow/118130922.cms,"KALIMPONG: Most residents of Kalimpong, and adjoining Siliguri and Darjeeling, have no clue the thukpa that had been filling their bowls for over half a century came from a factory set up by the Dalai Lama 's elder brother, a towering spiritual figure among Tibetans, who passed away on Saturday at 97.Way back in 1966-67, Gyalo Thondup not only built his residence, Tagtser House, in Kalimpong but also set up a noodle-making factory, Trans Himalaya. The popular Tibetan dish, thukpa, soon became a staple of the region, where Tibetans came as refugees. In no time, Trans Himalaya's produce was being exported to Sikkim and other parts of India as well as to adjoining Bhutan and other countries.While the thukpa produced by Trans Himalaya became a rage, most people in the region were not even aware the 14th Dalai Lama's elder brother lived in Kalimpong.""If we look at the history of noodles in Kalimpong... Gyalo Thondup started it in an authentic Tibetan style. By the 1970s, it had become extremely popular. His noodles were in demand until Covid,"" said trader Subash Pradhan who sells noodles in Kalimpong.Thukpa making involves rolling the dough, cutting it into thin strands with a techno blade, leaving it at room temperature for three days, and then sun-drying it for another day. Lhamo Thondup, an aide of the Dalai Lama's brother, had mastered the art and was the guiding force behind Trans Himalaya. His grandson Tenzing Rigzin now owns Eagle Noodles , another prominent Kalimpong brand.The Tibetan community remembers the leader differently.

"6 months after riot, 11 UP families return not to homes but rubble",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/6-months-after-riot-11-up-families-return-not-to-homes-but-rubble/articleshow/118130895.cms,"BAREILLY: Six months after the violence, the dust in Gausganj still hasn't settled. On July 18, communal clashes left one Hindu man dead and several injured. In the days that followed, 42 Muslim families fled or were forcibly displaced, and eight homes were bulldozed by the administration for ""encroaching on government land"". The 58 Muslim men held continue to languish in jail.Scattered and uncertain, the displaced families sought refuge in the homes of relatives in different villages, only to move again when they could afford to rent modest dwellings. With no stable income, they continued working as labourers whenever they could find work. Their children, once students, saw their education come to an abrupt halt.Now, 11 families have returned under security cover - not to homes, but to rubble, looted cupboards, shattered doors, and a village that doesn't know whether to welcome them back or push them away.Shafeekan, 60, steps carefully over what used to be her doorstep, now just a jagged remnant of concrete. ""At least I have my home back,"" she says. ""We are a family of daily wagers and I have no money to fight the cases of my two sons and husband. I don't know how they'll come out of jail.""Ruksana Begum, 62, sits on the narrow ramp of her front porch, her gaze darting toward the cops patrolling the village. ""We do not want to talk. We have no problem,"" she murmurs, before vanishing behind a tattered curtain.Mohd Tahir, 23, is here, but not to stay. ""I don't live here anymore. I work in Haryana,"" he says, his voice low, his eyes watchful. ""I came to settle my parents. Nothing is left. We have to start from scratch.""Al Jabah, 9, won't be going back to school soon. ""I saw my schoolbag torn. I don't go to school now,"" she says.For now, the survival of these families depends on charity. ""An NGO provides us with meals and basic necessities like utensils and brooms,"" says Mevish Jahan, whose son Yasinis behind bars. ""Our electricity metres are broken, and water supply is erratic.""Gausganj, once home to marginal farmers and labourers, became an open battleground following the violence. Livestock was taken. Tractors and farming equipment were seized. Land, too, is now under threat. ""We get offers through common connections, asking us to sell at throwaway prices,"" says a returnee. ""When we protested, we were threatened with more FIRs. We have little hope of justice.""For some families in the village, resentment still runs deep. Tejpal, a 23-year-old Hindu man, was killed in the riots and his family is still seeking justice. ""He was my nephew,"" says panchayat assistant Raj Kumari. ""He was murdered. And now they are being allowed back? How can we tolerate this? Today, police are with us, but what about after six months? Who will guarantee our security?"" Tensions are expected to peak as Holi approaches. ""We have set up a police picket at the village entrance,"" says Shahi SHO Amit Balyan. ""A large Hindu gathering is expected, so we're keeping a heavy force deployed.""","On july 18, communal clashes left one hindu man dead and several injured. 42 muslim families fled or were forcibly displaced, and eight homes were bulldozed.

WHO: Use low sodium salt to reduce heart attack risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/who-use-low-sodium-salt-to-reduce-heart-attack-risk/articleshow/118130308.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a renewed effort to reduce sodium intake, WHO has recommended that people should consider replacing regular table salt with Lower-Sodium Salt Substitutes ( LSSS ).LSSS refers to the salt form in which a certain percentage of sodium chloride is replaced with another mineral, most commonly potassium chloride. Use of LSSS when compared to regular salt is linked with reduction in heart attack and stroke risk, WHO said.WHO, in 2012, had issued a guidance document that was later adopted by member states including India which set a global target to reduce mean population sodium intake by 30% by 2030. But current trends suggest slow progress which is why it has come up with this new strategy to promote LSSS, in addition to encouraging member states to reduce overall sodium intake.It is sold by different brands in India and has 15- to 30% less sodium. However, its uptake is very low due to higher cost and low awareness. Pink Himalayan salt, black salt and sea salt, that are growing in popularity, do not fall in this category.WHO recommendation is based on findings from 26 randomised controlled trials in adults in which assignment to LSSS compared to regular salt resulted in reductions in blood pressure over 56 days to five years of follow-up. LSSS is not only low in sodium, but also contains potassium which is associated with lower levels of blood pressure.However, WHO warns, high levels of potassium can be harmful to those with impaired kidney function because their kidneys may not be able to excrete mineral leading to hyperkalemia - a condition that affects heart function and can be life-threatening. WHO guideline on LSSS is, therefore, not applicable for individuals with kidney impairments or with other circumstances or conditions that might compromise potassium excretion. As there is insufficient evidence of the benefits of substituting regular table salt with LSSS in children & pregnant women, these two categories have also been kept out of the ambit of WHO recommendation.Dr Mohit Gupta, professor of cardiology at Delhi's G B Pant hospital said switching to low-sodium salt substitutes can be beneficial for most people in reducing sodium intake and lowering blood pressure, thereby decreasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases .Dr Kameshwar Prasad, head of neurology at Fortis Healthcare and Dr Kunal Gandhi, senior consultant, nephrology at Amrita Hospital Faridabad, on the other hand, suggested that it may be better to encourage cutting down salt intake instead of promoting LSSS.","Lsss refers to the salt form in which a certain percentage of sodium chloride is replaced with another mineral.

Apply mind: SC to Gujarat government on Congress MP's poem recital,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/apply-mind-sc-to-gujarat-government-on-congress-mps-poem-recital/articleshow/118130098.cms,"It's a poem, not against any religion: SC backs Congress MP

NEW DELHI: Observing that a poem recited by Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi did not seem to be against any religion, Supreme Court on Monday asked the Gujarat govt ""to apply its mind"" to the poem and take a stand on the politician's plea to quash criminal proceedings initiated against him in the state for hurting religious sentiments.The court granted two weeks to the state govt to take a decision while highlighting that it was just a poem and creativity was also important for society. The bench said Gujarat high court did not appreciate the meaning of the poem while hearing a plea filed by Pratapgarhi.Appearing for the Congress MP, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said, ""The judge (of Gujarat HC) has done violence to the law. That is my worry.""Reading English translation of the poem, which was attached by Pratapgarhi in his petition, the bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said, ""It is ultimately a poem. It is not against any religion. This poem indirectly says even if somebody indulges in violence, we will not indulge in violence. That's the message which this poem gives... that we will quietly suffer the violence but we will not do anything. So that somebody who indulges in violence will be dethroned. It is not against any particular community.""As the state govt sought time to file its reply and sought adjournment, the bench told its lawyer, ""Please apply your mind to the poem. After all, creativity is also important."" The court also extended its interim order by which the MP was protected in the case lodged against him for posting a video clip with the poem 'Ae khoon ke pyase baat suno'.On Jan 17, HC had refused to quash the FIR, saying there was a need for further probe. It had said the poem's tenor indicated something about the throne and that responses to the poem on social media pointed to a potential disturbance in social harmony. It had said all citizens, especially an MP, should behave in a manner that did not disrupt communal or social harmony.After Gujarat HC order, Pratapgarhi appealed in SC which on Jan 21 granted him protection. Noting that he had not been arrested in the case so far, SC had said ""no further steps shall be taken in any manner on the basis of the FIR"".","It's a poem, not against any religion: sc backs congress mp imran pratapgarhi.

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Anurag Thakur on Monday took aim at Congress’ latest election disaster in Delhi. Thakur called out LoP in Lok Sabha and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi saying, ""Rahul ji, zero check karlijiye,Speaking in the Lok Sabha during a debate on the Union Budget, Thakur held up a sign that read, ""12,00,000 income par 0 tax,"" referencing the tax relief for the middle class announced in the budget. He then turned his focus to Congress’ electoral record in Delhi.""Rahul ji, zero check kar lijiye. Ye Congress ki seaton ki baat nahi hai,"" Thakur remarked amid protests from NCP (SCP) MP Supriya Sule.He then listed the years 2014, 2015, 2019, 2020, 2024, and 2025, questioning how many seats Congress had secured in Delhi in each of those years. His question was met with a resounding ""zero"" from BJP MPs.Thakur declared that under Rahul Gandhi’s leadership, Congress had set a record for consistent electoral failure. His remarks came after BJP’s landslide victory in the Delhi Assembly elections, where the party secured 48 out of 70 seats, ending AAP’s decade-long rule. AAP was reduced to just 22 seats. Congress failed to win a single seat, marking its third consecutive zero tally in Delhi polls.The former Union minister IT minister also targeted Congress leaders for not participating in the ongoing Maha Kumbh, suggesting that they might have been advised against it by ""Uncle Soros and Uncle Sam."" He recalled how even former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had taken a dip in the sacred waters but claimed today’s Congress leadership was avoiding it.""We all know that Maha Kumbh has been going on, I also got an opportunity to take a dip. I cannot explain the supernatural joy I experienced. Even Nehru had taken a dip in the Kumbh but today's generation is not ready to go.""""If they had gone, they also would have got an opportunity... maybe Uncle Soros and Sam would have issued a fatwa that no one will go to Ram Temple or take a holy dip in Kumbh,"" he said.On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had hailed BJP's victory in Delhi, calling it historic and saying that the people had ""freed"" the city from ""AAP-da"" (a play on words referring to AAP as a disaster).

NEW DELHI: Since 2014, the BJP has been moving from one poll victory to another -- both on the national as well as the state level -- with seemingly nothing able to stand in the way of the Modi wave.However, one thorn in BJP's side was Delhi, where the Arvind Kejriwal-led fortress managed to survive the saffron tsunami not once, but twice.However, 2025 proved to be a breakthrough year as the BJP broke the 27-year-old jinx to storm back to power in the Capital. It defeated the indomitable Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) by winning 48 seats in the 70-member Delhi assembly.Bristling with confidence after acquiring the Rajdhani in the North, the party has already given clear indications that its next mission is to make inroads in the eastern state of West Bengal.Like Delhi, making inroads in the Mamata Banerjee-ruled Bengal has been an uphill task for the BJP for the past two assembly elections.In the 2016 assembly elections, buoyed by the majority mandate at the Centre, the BJP expected to emerge as a key party but faced an embarrassing defeat. The party won only 3 seats in the 294-seat West Bengal assembly.In 2019, the BJP came back to power at the Centre with an even bigger mandate and by then had a decent presence in even the northeastern states, where BJP had negligible presence before 2014.Two years down the line, the party made another attempt to breach the fortress of Mamata Banerjee but to no avail.In 2021, when the results trickled in, the BJP won only 77 seats with TMC winning a whopping mandate by securing victory on 215 seats. Though the BJP vote and seat share improved substantially, it was far less than the 200-seat mark the party had expected to win in the polls.Just like Delhi in 2015 and 2020, the BJP fell flat in Bengal in 2016 and 2021.However, with the BJP finally triumphing in Delhi, Bengal BJP leaders now see the possibility that Bengal may not be ""mission impossible"" anymore.As BJP was celebrating its victory in the Capital on February 8, its top Bengal leader Suvendu Adhikari shot off a salvo at CM Mamata Banerjee, saying after the national capital, Bengal would vote for the BJP by uprooting ruling TMC.""Delhi ki jeet hamari hai ... 2026 mein Bengal ki baari hai … (Delhi's victory is ours ... in 2026 it will be Bengal's turn),"" Adhikari said while reacting to BJP's massive comeback after 27 years of political exile.Pumped by the BJP's historic win in Delhi, Bengal BJP chief and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar said Delhi's victory would serve as a morale booster for party workers in West Bengal ahead of next year's assembly elections.BJP's Amit Malviya, who heads the party's I-T department, said that ""jitters from the Delhi results are being felt in West Bengal"" and claimed that ""nervous"" Mamata Banerjee would go solo in next year's assembly polls.""A nervous Mamata Banerjee has told TMC MLAs that there will be NO alliance in Bengal … It is not surprising that she applies a different yardstick to the opposition in Haryana and Delhi but is unwilling to cede space for the alliance at home,"" Malviya wrote on X.","In 2025, the bjp broke the 27-year-old jinx to storm back to power in the capital.

NEW DELHI: Haryana BJP on Monday issued a show cause notice to minister Anil Vij who has been vocal against his own party for quite some time.In the notice, the party asked Vij to reply within three days over his recent public statements against the Haryana BJP chief and chief minister position held by Nayab Singh Saini.A few days ago, Vij alleged that CM Saini's close aide colluded against him by backing the rival candidate during last year's Haryana assembly election.The minister claimed that one Ashish Tayal backed Chitra Sarwara in the Ambala Canntt constituency during the state polls in which Vij won with a margin of 7,277 votes. Sarwara contested the assembly elections as an Independent after she was denied a ticket by the Congress.Vij also posted a video compilation of pictures in which people with Tayal were seen campaigning for Sarwara during the assembly elections. The compilation also had a photo of Tayal with CM Saini.The minister has been targeting the party's state government while alleging that his orders were being ignored. His unhappiness is said to have started after a meeting of the Haryana cabinet in which he had raised this issue.""Ashish Tayal, who calls himself a friend of Nayab Saini, has many pictures with Nayab Saini on Facebook. The same workers who are seen with Ashish Tayal during the assembly elections are also seen with the BJP's opposing candidate Chitra Sarwara. What is the relationship? Tayal is still Nayab Saini's best friend, so the question arises who made him oppose the BJP candidate?,"" Vij wrote this on X in Hindi.The remark by Vij came two days after the BJP relieved Tayal of his official posts in the Ambala unit. However, the move did not pacify the minister.Anil Vij not only pointed a finger at the Haryana CM but also the state BJP chief Mohan Lal Badoli , who he said should step down given the allegations of gang rape case him. The case was registered against Badoli in December last year in Himachal.""I wonder how a person who is facing the charge of gang rape can attend or chair a meeting of the party being attended by women. Ours is a sacred party, and we maintain its sanctity. Hence, he should have resigned.

They have to decide whether they will do coalition politics or go it alone. Also, it has become necessary to make fundamental changes in the party's organisation,"" Anwar said in a post on X.Party leader Rashid Alvi echoed similar sentiments and said that the grand-old party needs to ""respect all parties in the INDIA bloc"" if they aim to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).He warned that the results were a cause of concern for the Muslim community in Delhi, adding, “This election has forced them to think that the BJP has won because of us. If we want to defeat the BJP, we must respect all parties in the INDIA alliance and strengthen the coalition.”""If Congress and Aam Aadmi Party had fought Delhi elections together, then BJP could not have won. Congress high command has to decide if we have to go with our allies or contest elections alone. What has happened in Delhi is a matter of worry for the Muslims in Delhi,"" he said.""This election in Delhi has forced them to think that BJP has won the election because of us (Congress). If we have to defeat BJP, we have to respect all parties in the INDIA alliance and also strengthen the alliance and fight elections unitedly,"" Alvi added.The BJP secured a two-third majority in the Delhi assembly elections, marking the end of Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) decade-long rule in the capital. This victory brought the BJP back to power in Delhi after 27 years, with the party winning 48 out of 70 seats.AAP managed to win only 22, with several of its top leaders, including former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, suffering defeats. Kejriwal lost the New Delhi seat to BJP’s Parvesh Verma by a margin of 4,089 votes, while Congress’s candidate Sandeep Dikshit performed poorly, securing just 4,568 votes.Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the victory as “historic,” saying, “The people of Delhi have driven out ‘AAP-da’. Today, development, vision, and trust have won in Delhi. Ostentation, anarchy, arrogance, and the ‘AAP-da’ that had engulfed Delhi have been defeated.”Kejriwal, in a video message, accepted the mandate and congratulated the BJP. “We accept the people’s verdict with humility. I hope the BJP fulfils all the promises for which people have voted for them,” he said.","Congress failed to win a single seat, marking its third consecutive zero tally in the delhi assembly.

Offence is best defence: Politics of confrontation

NEW DELHI: Arvind Kejriwal 's dream run in Delhi has come to an end. After two sweeping victories - in 2015 and 2020 - Kejriwal's AAP has been swept out of power in the 2025 assembly elections. The BJP has finally managed to breach Kejriwal's Delhi fortress to regain power after a gap of 27 years. The former Delhi chief minister, who was out on bail in the excise policy case, ran a very aggressive campaign against the BJP and also targeted the Congress. So, why did Kejriwal lose? Here's a look at some of the tricks that failed to click for the AAP chief.Arvind Kejriwal, who was out on bail in the excise policy case, resigned as chief minister of Delhi in September 2024, months ahead of elections to take a high moral ground on the issue of corruption.""I am ready for Agni Pariksha. Two days later, I will resign as chief minister. I will not sit on that chair till the people announce their verdict,"" Kejriwal had said at the time of resignation.Kejriwal, who had refused to resign even when he was in jail, eventually gave up his chair amid turmoil faced by him in the Delhi excise policy case. Several top leaders, including Kejriwal himself, faced accusations of accepting bribes from liquor companies in exchange for favorable policies. Eventually, several AAP leaders were jailed in connection with the case.Kejriwal's claim to fame in his first two terms was his transparent and pro-people governance model. The AAP chief claimed credit for transforming Delhi's government schools and his Mohalla clinics provided cheap medicare to the poor. In the 2020 elections, Kejriwal sought votes for his work and AAP campaign centred around the change it had brought to the lives of the people. However, this time around AAP's campaign was centred around its attacks on the BJP leadership and the Congress. Kejriwal, who along with top AAP leadership faced several corruption charges, focused less on development and governance narratives. He called BJP ""Gali Galauj Party.""In the middle of the campaign, Kejriwal dropped a bombshell as he accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna waters to kill people of Delhi. Kejriwal's charges gave a toxic turn to Delhi campaign with both BJP and Congress going all out against the AAP chief. At the end, as the results show - the people of Delhi were not swayed by his ""concerns"" for them.Arvind Kejriwal tried to woo the middle class by unveiling his party’s manifesto for them. He claimed that the middle class were ignored by successive governments and accused other political parties of treating them as ""just an ATM for the government"". Ironically though, Kejriwal's manifesto did not mention what he would do for the middle class if voted to power but only listed seven demands from the Centre to improve their lives. Little wonder, at the end the Centre's sops for the middle class in the Uunion Budget appealed more to Delhi voters than the AAP's demands.Confrontation has been a part of Kejriwal's politics right from the beginning. This time around it was no different. Right through his campaign, Kejriwal trained his guns at Delhi Police and the Election Commission. Kejriwal accused the Election Commission and Delhi Police of colluding with the BJP to subvert the electoral process and prevent AAP from campaigning. Kejriwal targeted Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar and alleged that he ""wants a job post-retirement"" and was ""destroying the country"" for the post. Kejriwal's decision to take on the Congress along with the BJP boomeranged as on several seats, AAP's margin of defeat is less than the votes polled by the Congress candidate. Both Kejriwal and Rahul made relentless attacks against each other giving an opportunity to mock the allies-turned-rivals and take digs at opposition unity.",Kejriwal's dream run in delhi has come to an end.

He had been unwell for a few days, down with a bout of diarrhoea, but on January 12, seven-year-old Sai Chavan suddenly fell to the ground, and stopped moving. Mother Noor Jahan and father Suraj rushed him to hospital where doctors were flummoxed: Sai had symptoms they couldn't diagnose. Eventually, he was taken to a private hospital in Pune city and it was there that specialists had answers for the couple - their son had Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS).By early February, the Chavans' neighbourhood of Nanded Gaon had enough cases to be classified as the ""primary outbreak zone"" - nearly 90 cases would come from this area and nearby localities of Kirkatwadi, Sinhagad Road and Khadakwasla, all that were not long ago merged with Pune Municipal Corporation.On February 4, almost a month after the first cases emerged, health authorities released their findings. Bacteria Campylobacter jejuni had made its way into the water supply, they said, triggering a mass infection event. So far, more than 180 people have been sickened; six have died.The Chavans found themselves at ground zero. ""We should never have trusted the corporation's water, it was our mistake,"" said Noor. Near her stood Suraj, trying to get his son to walk again. But Sai's knees buckled; he was still in pain.The family was given a municipal tap connection after Nanded Gaon merged with PMC in 2021, but with a catch: the water they got - for an hour every day - was sourced from a nearby well. The well's water was only chlorinated, unlike the rest of Pune's supply which goes through an elaborate purification process at a treatment plant. Incidentally, the well was also the source of water for households across Kirkatwadi, Nandoshi village, Dhayari, Sinhagad Road and DSK Vishwa township.Vikas Joshi, a resident of DSK Vishwa, whose brother is in hospital on oxygen support with GBS symptoms, says, ""There is no point in having a water filter here at home because the supply itself is so contaminated. We buy large cans, boil the water and then drink it.""Dr Santosh Rawale, who practises in Dhayari, says GBS fears are rampant.

NEW DELHI: Pariksha Pe Charcha 2025 broke tradition with an open-air, informal conversation at Sunder Nursery, replacing the conventional auditorium setup, as students engaged with PM Narendra Modi in a free-wheeling discussion around diet, stress, technology and personal struggles related to examinations.Modi revealed, ""Had I not been PM, I would have liked to work in the skill development ministry."" He advised the young audience to ""break hierarchical barriers"" and emphasised, ""True leadership is about inspiring and guiding others, not just giving orders.""Focusing on skill development, Modi said, ""Degrees are valuable, but skills make you indispensable."" He shared examples of young entrepreneurs and innovators who turned their passions into careers, emphasising that adaptability and continuous learning define success today. ""You are lucky to be growing up in an era with so much technology... but you must decide whether you are using it wisely.""Are you spending hours watching reels, or are you learning something from technology? Technology is not a storm that will sweep you away-it is a tool. If you use it properly, it will empower you,"" PM Modi said addressing a common complaint parents have of their children.Students participated in a candid exchange with Modi, marked by warmth and spontaneity. ""Earlier, we met him on stage, but this time, it feels personal,"" one student shared. Another added, ""No scripts, no formality - just open discussion. It makes us feel heard.""The discussion covered a wide range of topics, from language and culture to health and mindfulness. Akanksha from Kerala praised Hindi, prompting the PM to recite a poem. ""Society wrongly associates success with exam scores. But real success comes from persistence. A good cricketer focuses on the ball, not the noise in the stadium. Similarly, students should focus on learning, not stress,"" Modi said.Traditional food customs were also highlighted as students enjoyed til-gud (sesame-jaggery) sweets. ""Just like we offer guests something at home, he shared with us,"" a student observed. PM Modi underscored mindful living, asking, ""Do you know how many teeth we have?"" to stress proper chewing habits.On exam stress, he reassured students, ""Marks don't define you."" Modi told students that knowledge and examinations are two different things. One should not view exams as be-all and end-all in life, he said.Stress, he said, is like a pressure cooker, and urged students to express their emotions openly. ""Depression often arises due to lack of communication,"" he noted, encouraging them to embrace challenges: ""Every difficulty brings an opportunity to grow.""Encouraging students to balance hobbies with studies, he used an analogy: ""If you have a pet dog at home, do you stop spending time with it just because exams are near? No, because it brings you joy. Similarly, hobbies refresh the mind and keep you balanced.""Urging parents to not use their children as models to ""show off"", he said they should not compare them with others and instead support them. When asked what advice he would give talented students who work hard but don't achieve success, Modi said ""rather than focusing on what someone is lacking, appreciate what they excel at. If you encourage them, they will feel valued. Instead of just studying for exams, students should also write-like poetry or essays-to express their thoughts.""He reinforced the importance of curiosity and lifelong learning, telling students, ""Be inquisitive. Never stop asking questions. Learning doesn't end with exams; it's a lifelong pursuit."" Emphasising knowledge and examinations are two different things, he cited India's tradition of questioning and exploration, noting that great minds push boundaries by asking the right questions.As the event concluded, PM Modi joked, ""Don't act bossy at home just because you now have a direct connection with the Prime Minister!""","Pm narendra modi held an open-air, informal conversation with students at sunder nursery.

NEW DELHI/CHANDIGARH: AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has called Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann, ministers and party MLAs to Delhi for deliberations on Tuesday, in a move that was not only seen as aimed at insulating its government but also termed by rivals as ""preparation"" for the removal of Mann from the top post.Although AAP termed it an ""organisational meeting"" for feedback and acknowledging work done by Mann and Punjab MLAs in Delhi polls, it intensified speculation about unrest in the party over failure to deliver its poll promises and growing tensions between Kejriwal and Mann. AAP Punjab netas will attend along with party members from Delhi.Stirring the pot, BJP's Tarun Chugh claimed ""countdown for Mann's government has started"", while party MLA Majinder Sirsa cautioned the CM on ""plans afoot to remove him"".Congress talked about the imminent prospect of mid-term polls in Punjab. ""More than 30 AAP MLAs in Punjab are in touch with us,"" said leader of opposition in Punjab, Partap Singh Bajwa, while Congress MP from Gurdaspur Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa predicted mid-term polls. ""It depends on how many AAP MLAs switch sides. Congress is the only option for AAP MLAs as BJP has no future in state,"" he said.AAP senior spokesperson Neel Garg, however, accused Sirsa of ""rumour mongering"" to please BJP leadership as he was in race for Delhi CM's post. ""Mann is leading a stable AAP government in Punjab and Sirsa should now worry about delivering BJP's pre-poll promises in Delhi,"" he said.""Bajwa is dreaming impossible dreams - just like 'Mungerilal'.

The scheme, marketed as a CSR initiative by large companies, claimed to empower women and support low-income households. Women could own a brand-new scooter priced at Rs 1.2 lakh for just Rs 60,000. Laptops, water tanks, fertilisers, and sewing machines were also promised at massive discounts. This generous offer was allegedly devised and executed by Ananthu Krishnan , 28, of Kudayathoor in Idukki district, a self-styled social activist with an eye for deception.The scheme, police sources said, was nothing more than a sophisticated Ponzi operation, rechannelling funds from new investors to fulfil promises to earlier ones - until it all came crashing down.On Jan 30, Ananthu was arrested and police froze the bank accounts linked to the operation, cutting off the flow of funds. An SIT was formed to uncover the full extent of the fraud. By then, the scam had already ensnared between 30,000 and 40,000 people, many of whom had taken loans to invest. Over 3,000 people have filed complaints, with investigations estimating the total fraud amount at Rs 500 crore. In just 34 FIRs, Rs 37 crore was confirmed as swindled.As per investigators, Ananthu lived extravagantly on the bilked money. He rented luxury apartments in Kochi's Marine Drive, spent heavily on a posh lifestyle, and invested in properties in at least five locations across Idukki and Kottayam. Ananthu had carefully built an image of credibility. Fluent in English and active on social media, he posed for photos with celebrities, politicians, and govt officials, adding an air of legitimacy to his scheme.He said large corporations were funding the initiative under CSR obligations, and to make it appear authentic, he even approached companies & NGOs for real CSR contributions, though none materialised. A project named 'Women on Wheels' was the gateway to the scam's success. Initial investors received scooters, fuelling trust & encouraging more bargain-hunters to invest. Soon, the scheme expanded, offering household items at steep discounts.But as with any Ponzi scheme , the money eventually ran dry and left thousands in the lurch. A single complaint to Kerala's police chief triggered the first probe. ""We didn't know the magnitude of the scam when the first FIRs were registered,"" police said. Ananthu's scam was more than just a solo act. It involved a web of NGOs and influential figures. Many organisations unknowingly acted as intermediaries, collecting money from investors and forwarding it to the scam. The scam had also spilled into Kerala's political circles, with accusations surfacing against politicians from multiple parties.","The scheme, marketed as a csr initiative by large companies, claimed to empower women and support low-income households.
