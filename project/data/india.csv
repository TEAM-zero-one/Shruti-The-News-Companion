Preparation of River-Sensitive Master Planning (RSMP) is another component of the action plan.According to NMCG, five cities - Kanpur, Ayodhya, Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar, Moradabad, and Bareilly - have already developed their URMPs, setting the benchmark for other urban centres. Twenty-five more URMPs will be prepared this year. It will be part of creating 60 such plans across India over the next two to three years in the first phase.","The plan covers agra, ayodhya, kanpur, lucknow, prayagraj, varanasi, jhansi, dehradun, haridwar, patna, ranchi, howrah, pune, nashik, chennai, hyderabad, udaipur, bhubaneshwar, surat.

'Avenger' video may be PR stunt, no such outfit operational in Agra: Cops



Hours after restaurant worker Gulfam Ali, 27, was shot dead and his co-worker injured in Agra, a self-proclaimed 'gau rakshak' who identified himself as Manoj Chaudhary and said he was a member of ' Kshatriya Gau Raksha Dal ', took to social media on Friday to announce the murder was ""retribution"" for the Pahalgam attack in which 26 tourists were killed. He said ""there were more deaths to be avenged"".A widely circulated video on social media purportedly shows a man, with two pistols tucked into his jeans and knives strapped on, claiming responsibility for the killing. In the video, Manoj Chaudhary, accompanied by another man who is similarly armed, is heard saying: ""Two k#### (slur) were killed in Taj city Agra. Kshatriya Gau Raksha Dal takes responsibility for this. I pledge in the name of Bharat Mata that if we do not avenge the killing of 26 with 2,600, I am not a son of Bharat Mata."" He then raises a religious slogan.Identity of Chaudhary's associate is not known. Police, however, rejected the claims, ""No organisation in the name of 'Kshatriya Gau Raksha Dal' is operational (here). The video on social media appears to be a publicity stunt. An FIR has been registered at Tajganj and a probe is on.""Agra police commissioner Deepak Kumar told TOI: ""The crime was a fallout of a quarrel over quality of food a few days ago. Investigation has revealed that the two men in the video are not Kshatriyas, and their self-declared status as gau rakshaks is also doubtful. At this stage, it appears to be more of a publicity stunt. CCTV footage from the crime scene shows the presence of four individuals. We have arrested a suspect.""Gulfam worked as a waiter at Shahid Ali Chicken Biryani , owned by his cousin Shahid Ali, in Tajganj. Around midnight, three men came on a scooter and shot him dead. Co-worker Saif Ali, 25, dived down and suffered minor injuries after a pellet grazed his neck. An FIR has been lodged under BNS sections 103 (1) (murder) and 109 (attempt to murder).","'avenger' video may be pr stunt, no such outfit operational in agra: cops.

SRINAGAR: Kashmir’s chief cleric Mirwaiz Umar Farooq returned to Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid to deliver his Friday sermon after restrictions of over a month, condemning the Pahalgam massacre and paying tributes to the victims.Mirwaiz and the others observed a minute’s silence in solidarity with the relatives of all those who lost their dear ones in the terror attack.Mirwaiz reminded his audience that the authorities had put him under house arrest ahead of previous Friday prayers in the past month. “Sadly, during this time, we had to witness a terrifying attack, which has left our hearts bleeding. The manner in which a carnage was carried out, more than two dozen people killed after ascertaining their identities and in front of their families, is shocking and chilling beyond belief,” Mirwaiz said.The chief cleric recalled the 1990 day when his father was shot dead by terrorists. “Who better can understand the pain and grief of loss of the families affected (in Pahalgam) than people who have suffered it (terror) for decades and still continue to. Today is the 36th martyrdom anniversary of my father, Mirwaiz Molvi Mohammad Farooq.”Mirwaiz told the gathering that “our hearts go out to these families who will never see their loved ones again, and our prayers are with them and we pray for speedy recovery of the injured.”Mirwaiz underscored Kashmiris’ famed hospitality, saying they had always opened their hearts and homes to outsiders, especially tourists. “People of Kashmir once again upheld the tradition of outreach, help, and humanity in this distressing time. Locals helped those at the (Pahalgam) spot to flee, even at risk to their own lives, in which pony operator Adil Hussain died. We pay homage to this brave young Kashmiri,” Mirwaiz said.He pointed out that other locals ferried the injured, some on their backs, to hospitals, while a complete shutdown was observed in memory of those killed. “The people of Kashmir sent a strong message of their total disapproval of such actions and solidarity and sympathy with the bereaved, standing shoulder to shoulder with them.” He requested authorities to allow him to visit the injured in hospitals and Adil’s family to pay condolences.Mirwaiz struck a note of caution and anguish at “a large section of mainstream media spreading communal rhetoric of hate against Kashmiris”. This, he said, has made Kashmiris across India vulnerable, forcing hundreds, especially students, to leave. “I appeal to govts in different states to ensure the safety of our students and all other Kashmiris,” Mirwaiz said.",Mirwaiz umar farooq returned to srinagar’s jamia masjid to deliver his friday sermon after restrictions of over a month.

SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir police said on Friday they have detained a person after a video widely circulated on social media showed a woman tourist complaining that he had asked her about her religion. This tourist also claims she had seen the terrorists while on a mule ride two days before the attack and that an overheard phone conversation had frightened her.Police identified the detainee as Aiyaz Ahmad Jungal of Gohipora Raizan Ganderbal district, north Kashmir and said he was a pony service provider at Thajwas Glacier, Sonamarg. The suspect was subjected to sustained interrogation, police said, adding they were trying to ascertain whether this suspect had any connection to the Pahalgam terror attack A tourist from Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh, posted a video on social media claiming she had met the suspected terrorists while on a mule ride in Pahalgam on April 20, just two days before the massacre. Talking to local TV channels in Jaunpur, she said, “There was a ponywalla who didn’t seem to be part of the group of ponywallas when they were ascending towards Baisaran, but he was walking with them.”“He asked me from which place you are. I said I am from Rajasthan but now live in UP. He asked me whether I had ever been to Ajmer Dargah. I said no, I’ve never been to Ajmer. Then he asked whether I was Hindu or Muslim. I told him I am Hindu. He asked if I had ever read the Quran, and I said no, I hadn’t,” she claimed.She claimed he then asked if she could read the Quran in Hindi. She said he also told her that if she came for the Amarnath Yatra he would arrange it without registration. “I tried to avoid his conversation,” she said.She said he then took out his phone from his boots and started saying he was sending 35 people in the valley. “Then he said Plan A has failed and he also talked about guns. I got more frightened,” she said.","Police identified the detainee as aiyaz ahmad jungal of gohipora raizan ganderbal district, north kashmir.

Nepal medic killed in Pahalgam didn’t get time to say he was a foreigner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nepal-medic-killed-in-pahalgam-didnt-get-time-to-say-he-was-a-foreigner/articleshow/120592414.cms,"Sudeep Neupane, 27, was the only foreign national killed in the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam.

NEW DELHI: After travelling across three states and an international border, the body of Sudeep Neupane , 27, the only foreign national killed in the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam, reached his home in Kalikanagar, a neighbourhood in Butwal, western Nepal, draped in the national flag.He was cremated at Triveni Ghat around noon, with hundreds, including local govt officials, gathered for the last rites. Sudeep, his family said, was shot immediately after he identified himself as a Hindu and had no time to explain that he was not from India.Butwal, a city in Lumbini province, sits just 25km north of the Indian border at Sunauli, close enough for shared economies and quiet daily crossings. It is not the kind of place where news arrives quickly, and yet by the time the ambulance reached Sudeep’s home, the neighbourhood had already gathered.Sudeep had travelled to Kashmir with his mother Reema, sister Sushma, and brother-in-law Ujjwal Kafle on April 19. It was meant to be a brief trip, just long enough to give his divorced mother some respite. On the day of the shooting, the family was walking along the meadow when a group of men with guns approached. Witnesses later said the attackers asked about their religion. Sudeep was walking slightly ahead of the others. He answered that he was Hindu. Before he could say anything else, he was shot. “He didn’t get the chance to say he was a foreigner,” said Tejulal Neupane , his uncle, who has since called for compensation from the Indian govt. “He had nothing to do with anything.”His death triggered a series of logistical efforts across two countries. His body was airlifted from Srinagar to New Delhi on Wednesday evening, then flown to Lucknow later that night. From there, it was driven overland to Sunauli before crossing into Nepal. A district magistrate from Uttar Pradesh accompanied the body as far as the border. At Sunauli, it was received by Dadhiram Neupane, Sudeep’s uncle and the ward chairperson of Butwal-14. A police escort led the final leg to Kalikanagar. Butwal mayor Khelraj Pandey, Rupandehi chief district officer Basudev Ghimire , and police chief Ranjit Singh Rathore joined the procession.Sudeep lived in Kalikanagar for most of his life. After his parents, Dhruv Neupane and Reema Pandey, separated, he stayed behind to support his mother. His sister moved to Pokhara after marriage, but Sudeep remained, managing the household finances, arranging care, and eventually becoming its only earning member. He held a public health degree from Dharan and was pursuing further studies in Kathmandu while working part-time on an oral health campaign in rural Nepal.The job did not pay much, but it was steady, and he had grown invested in the work. “He wasn’t just showing up,” said Amrit Bhusal, who runs Modern Samaj Dental, the clinic that had employed him for nearly a year. “He was doing follow-ups. He was tracking cases. He was committed in a way that was unusual.”In Pyuthan, Bhairahawa, and along the outer districts of Rupandehi, his visits became routine. He carried a clipboard and often walked between health posts on foot. When he spoke about public health, his colleagues said, it was in practical terms — transport access, dental hygiene, vaccine follow-up — not in abstract declarations.At home, he was quiet. Neighbours described him as careful and unobtrusive. Rajendra Kumar Acharya, who lives two houses down, remembered a brief conversation before the trip. “He told us he was going to Kashmir. He seemed happy to be taking a break. That’s all.” His 89-year-old grandfather, Khemananda Neupane, learned of the death indirectly. “My wife stopped my prayers,” he said. “She told me something had happened. I didn’t understand at first.”His father, Dhruv Neupane, a teacher at Bhawanipur High School in Butwal-18, was returning from a teachers’ protest in Kathmandu when his phone began to ring. “No one would say it outright,” he said. “Only when I arrived home did I understand what they had been trying to tell me. It doesn’t matter where I live. He was my child.”","Sudeep neupane, 27, was the only foreign national killed in the terror attack on tourists in pahalgam. He was shot immediately after he identified himself as a hindu and had no time to explain that he was not from india.

NEW DELHI: The Union government on Friday informed Supreme Court that deletion of a provision in the 1995 Waqf Act barring enforcement of rights over unregistered waqfs through an amendment in 2013 resulted in a massive rise in Waqf Board properties country-wide from 2,07,394 to 8,72,870 and a corresponding increase in area from 18.3 lakh acres to 39 lakh acres.Delhi Waqf Board in 2013 had just nine properties having an area of 0.03 acres. By 2025, the number of properties under its control increased to 1,047 having an area of 28 acres. This phenomenon was more accentuated in Jammu & Kashmir, where the Auqaf Board had just one property with 0.42 acres in 2013, which increased to 32,533 with an area of 31.4 acres by 2025, the Centre's affidavit said.Even in the remote Andaman and Nicobar Islands, waqf properties increased from 35 in 2013 to 151 in 2025, with the accretion of an additional area of 138 acres. The least increase in waqf properties, from 51 in 2013 to 58 in 2025, was in Meghalaya, where Christians constitute 75% of the population, Hindus 11% and indigenous groups 9%.In Rajasthan too, the rise in waqf properties was minimal, adding 7,769 in 12 years to the 23,126 in 2013. In Tamil Nadu, waqf properties numbering 43,623 in 2013 increased by another 22,469 in the next 12 years. In Uttar Pradesh, Sunni Waqf properties increased from 12,914 in 2013 to 2,17,161 in 2025. In West Bengal, such properties increased from 17,946 in 2013 to 80,808 in 2025. In Gujarat, waqf properties increased from 3,074 in 2013 to 39,940 in 2025. Andhra Pradesh too saw a massive increase - from 390 in 2013 to 14,685 in 2025.Taking the overall picture of alarming increase in waqf properties without registration and suo motu declaration of a property as waqf by boards, the Centre said the 2025 amendment was brought in to ensure that ""Waqf Boards in the country are properly administered and function with transparency and prevent repeated abuse of waqf legislation which resulted in deprivation of personal properties of individuals and encroachment of govt land"".It said the amendment was necessitated because of ""repeated and documented instances across the country where Waqf Boards had claimed title over govt land, public utilities and protected monuments without deed, survey or adjudication, relying solely on the board's unilateral records. Said claims included waqf claims over collectors' offices, govt schools, ASI-protected heritage sites and land vested in state or municipal authorities"".","Delhi waqf board in 2013 had just nine properties having an area of 0.03 acres.

She was the only eyewitness who could have gone against the accused.""""While Rahman's family was busy with the burial, police registered a case against them under IPC Section 306 (abetment of suicide) without proper investigation... The probe was shoddy and the state should take action against the investigative officer,"" Bhuwan said.SC had earlier quashed the ""abetment of suicide"" case against Ziaul's family, flagging serious lapses in the police probe and ordered a re-investigation by an SIT, noting ""deeper undercurrents"" in the case. The SIT report, due April 15, 2025, is yet to be submitted. Ayyub said, ""My son was killed deliberately. He and the woman were bright students.

UDHAGAMANDALAM: The faceoff between Tamil Nadu governor R N Ravi and the state govt took a new turn with the former alleging that vice-chancellors of state universities were 'warned' by the govt not to participate in the two-day conference of VCs convened by Raj Bhavan on Friday. The DMK govt hit back at Ravi saying the VCs skipped the conference as it was 'illegal'.While the VCs of state-run universities were absent, VCs from central universities and deemed-to-be universities participated. ""Unfortunately, none of the vice-chancellors of state universities are participating. They have informed me that they have been warned by the state govt,"" the governor said at the conference, which was inaugurated by VP Jagdeep Dhankhar.Accusing govt of threatening some VCs, Tamil Nadu governor R N Ravi said: ""A VC had reached Ooty and something unprecedented happened. There was a midnight knock and a special branch police (officer) was there and he told him that if he (the VC) participated in the conference, he would not be able to go home and meet his family.""Referring to Salem Periyar University VC R Jagannathan, who was summoned on Friday by Suramangalam police for an inquiry pertaining to allegations that he floated a private firm and used university premises to run it, Ravi said: ""Another VC is at the police station at the moment.""Ravi said there is no politics involved in organising the conference, claiming that it has been showing results. ""But perhaps for people in govt, it is not a comfortable situation.""Hitting back at the governor, TN higher education minister Govi Chezhian said Ravi convened the conference in a deliberate attempt to pick a fight with the state govt since SC gave a ruling in govt's favour empowering it to appoint VCs.Chezhian said the governor organised the conference ""adamantly in violation of the law"" even after SC verdict. ""The VCs were aware that the conference was illegal and have skipped it. How is the state govt responsible for their absence?""Chezhian took a dig at the Vice-President as well. ""Participation of Dhankhar in the conference is not surprising. The whole country saw his aggressive activities against Mamta Banerjee govt when he was West Bengal governor.""DMK MP P Wilson posted on X: ""I condemn these false and irresponsible statements made by the Governor, who is proving to be incorrigible.

"Centre tells SC waqf law 'secular', says petitioners 'spinning a false narrative'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-tells-sc-waqf-law-secular-says-petitioners-spinning-a-false-narrative/articleshow/120631721.cms,"Supreme Court

Waqf Act restricted itself to secular side: Govt

NEW DELHI: Putting up a strong defence of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, the Centre called it a secular law and accused the petitioners challenging its validity in Supreme Court of spinning a false ""interference in religious affairs"" narrative on mandatory registration of every waqf, including ' waqf by user '. It said this provision was more than a century old.In a 1,332-page affidavit, joint secretary in the minority affairs ministry Shersha C Shaikh Mohiddin requested SC to abide by traditional assumption of validity of a law enacted by Parliament and conduct a detailed hearing without granting any stay on operation of the law, which is to stop misuse of 2013 amendment allowing encroachment of private and govt properties. In the last hearing, SC had flagged 3 issues in 2025 law - registration documents of waqf properties, inclusion of non-Muslims in Central Waqf Council and Waqf Boards & determination of govt land.In its affidavit, Centre pointed out that SC in the last 30 years never considered staying provisions of the 1995 Waqf Act and sought an ""equitable"" approach.Rebutting the charge that the new law represented an interference with religious rights of Muslims, the Centre said the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, restricted itself to secular dimensions like record management, procedural reforms and administrative structure and not even remotely attempted to interfere in any ritual, prayer or fundamental Islamic obligations.Addressing the three issues flagged by SC as 'contentious', the Centre said the architecture of the 1995 Waqf Act required a relook because of the sudden increase in the area covered under waqf. ""Till 2013, that is the period which included Mughal era, pre-independence era and post-independence era, the total area under waqf was 18.3 lakh acres. It is really shocking to note that after 2013, another 20.9 lakh acres of land were added to waqfs, which totalled 39.2 lakh acres,"" Centre said.It said no waqf or individual Muslims could validly question the 2025 provision for mandatory registration of waqf properties as this has been in existence since the enactment of Waqf Act, 1923, and the provision was consistently carried forward through the enactment of Waqf Act, 1954 and Waqf Act, 1995.""Legislative intent and policy has always been very clear with regard to waqf being registered so that it remains under the statutory regime with respect to its secular aspects like maintenance of accounts, survey of properties, transparent administration and supervision in case of transfer of property of waqf,"" the Centre said.""Those waqfs which have not registered themselves, including 'waqfs by user', since 1923, 1954, or at least prior to Jan 1, 1996 (date on which the 1995 Act came into force), nor have they been found to be in existence during the survey by the Survey Commissioner and an independent exercise mandated by law from the State Waqf Board and have no legal existence and any belated claim at this stage is not maintainable,"" it added.Centre said the legislative architecture over the last 100 years mandated registration of waqf properties and those who have violated the law are barred from arguing that ""exclusion of unregistered 'waqf by user' is either arbitrary, unreasonable or without any logic purpose or intent"".Central Waqf Council has 22 members and its nature of assignment is to recommend management of properties. Inclusion of a maximum of four non-Muslims would not alter the character or nature of the council. Similar is the case with Waqf Boards, where a maximum of three non-Muslims could be part of an 11-member body, it said.Defending provisions identifying unlawful waqf claims, Centre cited cases like Hyderabad's Viceroy Hotel wrongly claimed as waqf. It said earlier provisions enabled encroachments via 'waqf by user' and suo motu declarations. Now, govt property identified as waqf encroachment by a senior officer can be challenged before Waqf Tribunals, HCs, and SC, ensuring fair scrutiny.","Supreme court had flagged 3 issues in 2025 law - registration documents of waqf properties, inclusion of non-muslims in central waqf council & determination of govt land.

NEW DELHI: A day after India formally communicated to Pakistan that it was keeping Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) between the two countries in abeyance, Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday held a meeting on how swiftly the decision could be implemented and finalised a detailed roadmap, including quick desilting of rivers and dams as an immediate step to prevent the flow of river waters to the neighbouring country.The meeting, attended by Jal Shakti minister C R Paatil and senior officials, is learnt to have discussed implementation modalities in view of creating additional water storage infrastructure and speeding up work on hydro-power projects as medium- and long-term measures so that waters of the western rivers - Indus, Jhelum and Chenab - can be adequately used by India.Desilting of rivers and dams will be done on priority. It will augment supply of water to the India side, resulting in slightly lesser flow to Pakistan which already faces a deficit of 32% in meeting its irrigation and drinking water needs.""A roadmap was prepared in the meeting. Three options were discussed. Govt is working on short-term, medium-term and long-term measures so that not even a drop of water goes to Pakistan. Soon, desilting of rivers will be done to stop the water and divert it,"" Paatil told the media after the meeting.At present, India doesn't have the capacity to store even 3.6 MAF of water on the western rivers, the share which was allowed to it under IWT. Similarly, 3,482 MW capacity of hydro-power generation has been constructed by India out of an estimated power potential of 20,000 MW which can be harnessed from the western rivers. Speeding up work on Kishanganga and Ratle hydro-electric projects will solve the problem to a great extent.Untapped irrigation potential was one of the key points which drew attention of policymakers, specifically in view of maximising use of water from the western rivers. This potential cannot be tapped unless India increases its storage capacity and redirects surplus flow from J&K to Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan.Work on Tulbul project on Jhelum, suspended since 1986, will help as the accompanying barrage will have a storage capacity of around 0.3 MAF of water.",India formally communicated to pakistan that it was keeping indus waters treaty (iwt) between the two countries in abeyance.
