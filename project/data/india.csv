Poll Do you believe the development initiatives in Ladakh since its UT status have effectively addressed local concerns? Yes No

NEW DELHI/LEH: As Ladakh grapples with an uneasy calm after violent protests claimed four lives, senior govt functionaries are intrigued at the way the violence erupted as they argue that the region, once at the margins of governance, has seen “unprecedented development” since being carved out as a UT under the J&K Reorganisation Act in 2019.A senior official described it as ironical that fringe elements succeeded in inciting unrest when it was only after 2019 that the region was carved out of J&K to be constituted as an UT and that a concerted effort was made to fulfil popular aspirations related to connectivity, opportunities, infrastructure, new administrative structures. “People had celebrated the grant of UT status, yet a fringe succeeded in provoking unrest,” the official rued.The grant of UT status was followed by significant changes. Citing the measures, an official emphasised that the Centre has pumped resources into road, power, digital and social infrastructure. Key initiatives include the commissioning of 175 mobile towers, extension of the BharatNet project to all 193 gram panchayats, and progress on transmission lines linking Nubra, Zanskar and Changthang to the grid.Educational capacity was expanded with the setting up of University of Ladakh and Sindhu Central University, as well as the first medical college with 100 MBBS seats sanctioned in 2025.A separate UPSC exam centre in Leh has made career opportunities more accessible while literacy rates crossed 97% by 2024.In parallel, livelihood support has been targeted at traditional sectors. Under the PM Vishwakarma scheme, over 4,000 artisans — a big number for the small-sized UT — received credit and toolkits while nomadic pashmina herders were provided with predator-proof corrals and portable shelters.Tourism has also flourished, with arrivals doubling from 2.8 lakh in 2019 to over 5.2 lakh in 2023, boosted by projects such as Hanle Dark Sky Reserve and light-and-sound shows in Leh and Kargil.The Border Roads Organisation has accelerated strategic connectivity — Darbuk-Shyok-DBO road for year-round access to Galwan, Zoji-La tunnel, Nimmu–Padum–Darcha road, and upcoming Shinkun La tunnel, which will be the world’s highest. Together with Bilaspur–Manali–Leh railway project and Nyoma airfield, these projects underline Ladakh’s role at the frontier.The violence, sources feel, cannot be seen in isolation from long-standing demands around statehood, Sixth Schedule protections and resource control. Over the years, the Leh-based Apex Body and Kargil Democratic Alliance have sought constitutional safeguards to preserve Ladakh’s fragile demography and ecology.Analysts note that while local languages, Bhoti and Purgi, have been recognised as a step towards preserving linguistic heritage and ensuring inclusive governance, reservation for domiciles and that for women in hill councils was introduced. A High-Powered Committee was also constituted to address these concerns.",Govt intrigued at ladakh violence even after ‘unprecedented’ vikas.

Amit Shah’s Red Line On Jailed PMs, CMs, Ministers | Oppn Slam 'Draconian' Bill | Political Showdown

NEW DELHI: Going for a consensus with key opposition parties, Congress has decided to boycott the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) on three bills that prescribe automatic dismissal of CMs and ministers who are in jail for 30 days.While it comes on the back of boycott announced by TMC Samajwadi Party , AAP and Sena UBT, the decision of the lead opposition player implies the participation of remaining INDIA bloc parties like DMK , NCP, Left is also doubtful — raising the possibility of an entire opposition no-show in the crucial panel that will vet the bills including the 130th constitutional amendment that was tabled by Union home minister Amit Shah in the monsoon session of the Parliament.Congress sources said the decision on staying away from the JPC has been taken and a communication will be sent to the govt/Speaker soon.The stance shows that Congress has gone with key allies who decided to boycott early on, even as it was inclined to join the panel arguing that the govt could not be given a free reign in the committee. The concern about opposition unity was high since the four parties went ahead with their decision of boycott.Congress general secretary KC Venugopal had hinted as much when he told TOI that Congress will seek a consensus with the INDIA bloc and take a collective decision.Tabled in Lok Sabha on Aug 30, the bills triggered a bedlam in the House. The Parliament has not been able to announce JPC despite a passage of nearly a month since a decision to refer the three bills to the panel was announced.","Congress has decided to boycott the joint parliamentary committee (jpc) on three bills that prescribe automatic dismissal of cms and ministers who are in jail for 30 days.

NEW DELHI: An image of Jesus Christ inside a 'Vatican City-themed' Durga Puja pandal in Ranchi was replaced on Friday with that of Lord Krishna.The development came following objections raised by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). The VHP alleged that the marquee, organised by R R Sporting Club at Ratu Road, was made to ""hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus"" and encourage conversion. The organisers had rejected these charges earlier on Thursday.The club’s patron Vicky Yadav said the decision was taken by the puja committee members and not due to protests by any section, reports news agency PTI. “It was not due to the protest by a certain section but by our committee members to show all religions on the same platform,” he said. He said that European-style statues placed outside the pandal were retained.Yadav claimed that the design aimed to promote peace and brotherhood. ""India stands for religious harmony. If that doesn’t exist, then why not just declare this a Hindu nation?"" he asked, showing videos of Prime Minister Narendra Modi visiting churches abroad during official trips.He said the idea was inspired by India’s multi-faith culture and that the club promotes Sanatan Dharma..""We have been organising Durga Puja for the last 50 years, and every year we make pandals based on certain themes.

BENGALURU: Social media platform X said on Monday it was “deeply concerned” by a Karnataka HC order that empowers “millions of police officers” to issue arbitrary content takedown notices through a new portal called Sahyog.The Elon Musk-owned X said it will appeal the Sept 24 order as part of its broader effort to defend free expression in India but did not indicate whether it would be filed before HC or Supreme Court.The firm said it respects and complies with Indian law, but argued that the court’s decision fails to address key constitutional concerns it raised in its challenge. It drew attention to a recent Bombay HC ruling striking down a similar framework as unconstitutional.The platform rejected the view that its foreign incorporation prevented it from taking such positions, stressing it contributes significantly to public discourse in India and places user voices at the centre of its operations. A post from its Global Govt Affairs handle reads: “This new regime (takedown notices through portal) has no basis in the law, circumvents Section 69A of IT Act, violates Supreme Court rulings, and infringes Indian citizens’ constitutional rights to freedom of speech and expression.The company said the framework would allow content removal based solely on allegations of illegality without judicial review or due process for speakers, while threatening platforms with criminal liability for non-compliance.The post followed a HC ruling last Wednesday dismissing X Corp’s petition against govt takedown directions. Justice M Nagaprasanna held that American free speech standards cannot be transplanted into Indian constitutional thought and no global platform can bypass Indian law. HC had described social media as “a modern amphitheatre of ideas” that cannot be left to “anarchic freedom”. “Unregulated speech, under the guise of liberty, becomes a licence to lawlessness,” the order stated.","Elon musk-owned x said it will appeal the sept 24 order as part of its broader effort to defend free expression in india.

NEW DELHI: SC has ordered sending an additional chief metropolitan magistrate (ACMM) and a sessions judge in Delhi for training to the judicial academy after finding fault in orders passed by the judicial officers. Bail was granted by ACMM to a habitual offender couple and the same was upheld by sessions judge.A bench of Justices Ahsanuddin Amanullah and S V N Bhatti made it clear that it was not “whittling down pro-liberty principles” but the conduct of accused was such that they should not have been given bail and referred how the accused couple had earlier taken Delhi high court for a ride for four years, a fact which was not taken into consideration by lower courts and the HC also while granting them relief in a cheating case.The couple, facing criminal proceedings in six similar cases, had allegedly cheated Rs 1.9 crore on the pretext of selling a piece of land which was already sold and they refused to refund the money and an FIR was lodged against them subsequently. They then managed to get anticipatory bail from Delhi HC in 2018 after assuring the court to pay back the amount and they enjoyed liberty for almost five years. But they resiled from their statement and failed to pay the amount, compelling HC to cancel their bail in 2023 and by that time chargesheet in the case had been filed.Contending that chargesheet had already been filed, the couple had approached trial court for regular bail which was granted by trial judge and it was upheld by sessions judge and Delhi HC. The apex court also objected to HC order upholding the bail despite it having passed strong observations against them in earlier round of litigation.“In this backdrop, the ACMM, despite being made aware of HC’s order dated Feb 1, 2023 and even noting the same, proceeded on the simplistic premise that since the chargesheet had been submitted, no useful purpose would be served by taking the accused into custody, particularly as the stand taken by the Investigating Officer was that custodial interrogation was not required. Such reasoning, in our view, is untenable, inasmuch as the same glossed over the private respondents’ conduct, including undertakings made before a higher court viz. HC,” the bench said.“Before parting, we would be failing in our duty if we turned a blind eye to the manner in which the ACMM granted bail to the accused and the sessions judge refused to interfere with such grant of bail. In the facts herein, we deem it appropriate that the judicial officers who passed the orders shall undergo special judicial training for a period of at least seven days. The learned CJ of Delhi HC is requested to make appropriate arrangements for such training at Delhi Judicial Academy, with particular focus on sensitising the judicial officers on how to conduct judicial proceedings, particularly in matters where decisions of superior courts are involved and the level of weightage to be accorded thereto,” it said.",Supreme court orders sending an additional chief metropolitan magistrate (acmm) and a sessions judge in delhi for training.

CHANDIGARH: Pension must be treated as income while calculating compensation in motor accident cases, Punjab and Haryana HC ruled, calling it a “deferred fruit of hard work”.Justice Varinder Aggarwal raised the compensation for Manjit Kaur and her son from Rs 7.9 lakh to Rs 31 lakh, noting the tribunal wrongly ignored her late husband Dharam Singh’s two pensions totalling Rs 32,754 a month.Singh, 57, a retired Army serviceman later employed with Defence Security Corps, died in April 2018 after a car hit his bicycle in Jalandhar.“To disregard the pension while determining compensation would be to ignore both its economic reality and its social purpose,” the HC said, adding that pension is “often the sole means of sustenance and livelihood” and cannot be excluded when computing loss of dependency.","Pension must be treated as income while calculating compensation in motor accident cases, punjab and haryana hc ruled.

Police Lathicharge Protesters After Violence Breaks Out In Bareilly During ‘I Love Muhammad’ March

BAREILLY: At least 38 shops — mainly belonging to the minority community — were sealed by authorities in Bareilly on Monday, days after a clash erupted between police and protesters of the “I Love Muhammad” campaign last Friday. Shop owners alleged that the civic action was a reprisal for the violence.Locals said the shops, selling garments and footwear and located at Novelty Chowk about 200m from Clock Tower, were forcefully vacated by the Bareilly municipal corporation for “encroachment.” Shopkeepers said the units belong to the waqf board DM Avinash Singh said, “The shops have been sealed. If someone has any document regarding it, they can produce it before the municipal commissioner. We have checked and verified all documents before taking the step.”He added, “It was part of a crackdown on those rioters who tried to disrupt the city’s peace and law and order. The shopkeepers had also encroached upon a large drain on government land. The crackdown will continue.”Shopkeeper Mohd Waris countered, “Civic body filed a case for land ownership. However, we have a stay from the court. This action was taken only due to Dr Nafees Ahmed, spokesperson of Ittehad-e-Millat Council, who used to take rent from us. A civic team simply asked shopkeepers to vacate within three hours, without prior notice.”Internet services remained suspended in parts of Bareilly Monday as security forces maintained vigilance.","At least 38 shops, mainly belonging to the minority community, were sealed by authorities in bareilly on monday.

CUTTACK: In a relief to a woman seeking funds for urgent family needs, Orissa high court allowed premature encashment of her National Savings Time Deposit, overriding postal objections and setting a two-week deadline to process her request.Justice Dixit Shripad quashed the Aug 5 order of postal authorities denying Priyadarsini Das withdrawal before the five-year maturity, citing Hindu law that recognises emergencies, social obligations and family needs.Das needed money for a marriage. Her counsel argued amended Rule 8(d) of the 2019 scheme permits encashment after four years at lower interest. The high court said the rule “does not begin with negative phraseology” and cannot bar earlier withdrawal, noting “the funds in deposit belong to her and not to the entity which holds her money.”",Priyadarsini das needed money for a marriage.

NAGPUR: Holding that a minor’s consent for a physical relationship is “irrelevant” under current law, Nagpur bench of Bombay HC has refused to quash a case filed under Pocso Act against a 29-year-old Washim man who married a 17-year-old and fathered her child. HC ruled Friday that the FIR cannot be dismissed merely because the girl married the accused and later became a mother.Dismissing a plea by M A Beigh and two family members to set aside the case, a division bench of Justices Urmila Joshi-Phalke and Nandesh Deshpande said: “Despite knowing the girl was a minor, he commits an offence from the moment he takes her away from the legal custody of her parents. Merely because the girl has given birth to a child, the criminal act cannot be brushed aside.”Beigh married the girl on June 2, 2024, when she was 17. She gave birth to a baby boy in May. Cops registered the case after learning of the childbirth and the mother’s age.Now an adult, the survivor supported the accused in court, stating their relationship was consensual and the marriage was approved by both families. Her lawyer urged the court to treat it as an “exceptional case,” arguing prosecution would harm both mother and child.HC, however, saidthe accused “ought to have waited till the girl attained 18 years of age,” adding that taking a minor from her parents’ lawful custody is an offence regardless of affection or marriage.The judges noted SC is examining whether consensual adolescent relationships deserve different treatment under the Pocso Act, but said that until Parliament amends the law, courts must follow it. It also cited govt’s opposition to lowering age of consent, warning it would “reintroduce the very mischief the law was enacted to prevent”.","Bombay hc refuses to quash case filed under pocso act against a 29-year-old washim man.
