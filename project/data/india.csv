General secretary KC Venugopal echoed the boycott bloc, saying the govt was using parliamentary panels to push bills, though he indicated a tilt towards staying out of JPC.

Naming art gallery owner Rajesh Rajpal and lawyer Vishwang Desai, ED has alleged that Rajpal received proceeds of crime worth Rs 15.7 crore generated through the sale of fake paintings, whereas Desai acted as the sole intermediary, curating art options, negotiating terms and vouching for authenticity of the works before prospective buyers.The cartel allegedly traded in counterfeit works claiming they were by the likes of M F Husain, F N Souza and other prominent artists.The chargesheet also names Abhishek Jain, Manish Sakariya and Rare Art Gallery Pvt Ltd, saying Jain and Sakariya assisted in layering the proceeds of crime.According to the chargesheet, the accused had prepared forged certificates of authenticity and provenance of paintings, including an unsigned certificate pertaining to a painting allegedly by F N Souza, and duped a businessman buyer, who is the complainant in the case.ED's money laundering case is based on a cheating case registered at Tardeo police station in 2024.Earlier, the police had filed a closure report in the case, terming the dispute as being of 'civil nature' since the accused had returned Rs 2.2 crore to the complainant from the total money he received. However, the magistrate's court rejected the report and ordered police further investigation against Rajpal and Desai.ED claimed that by creating and circulating fabricated documents, Desai enabled Rajpal to misrepresent forged artworks as genuine, thereby inducing the complainant to part with Rs 15.7 crore through banking channels. Subsequently, some of this amount was withdrawn, with no clarity on its recipient or use.ED asserted that Desai's role extended beyond generating the proceeds of crime to projecting them as untainted property in Rajpal's hands. Although ED was unable to find a money trail directly linking it to Desai, it maintained that his active connivance and deliberate assistance allowed Rajpal to integrate and layer the illicit funds into the financial system under the guise of genuine art sales.","Ed has filed a chargesheet in a money laundering case related to a cartel involved in the sale of fake artworks.

MUMBAI: A private jet carrying passengers from Ahmedabad quietly scripted aviation history this weekend, becoming the first aircraft to officially land at the long-awaited Navi Mumbai airport.The jet, operating under a Non-Scheduled Operator Permit (charter), touched down at 10:20am on Saturday and flew back to Ahmedabad past noon the next day, completing the first-ever runway operation at the greenfield airport.Though an IndiGo Airbus 320 aircraft landed on the Navi Mumbai main runway 26 in Dec 2024, it was a validation flight mandated to test the airport's navigation systems.Prior to this, a symbolic touchdown took place in October, when an IAF Airbus C-295, a tactical airlifter, touched down on the main runway without using the airport's ground-based navigation aids.""The Airports Authority of India (AAI) on September 19 granted approval for the landing of a non-scheduled aircraft, marked 'passengers flight' at Navi Mumbai,"" said a source.To accommodate this arrival and departure, AAI cancelled its earlier notice (NOTAM to pilots, airlines) about Navi Mumbai runway's closure till 11:59pm, Sept 20.A new NOTAM was issued on Friday, which announced that the Navi Mumbai airport runway was open from 8:30am to 11am on Saturday and another three hours on Sunday.The private jet, a Pilatus PC-24 (VT-APV), took off from Ahmedabad at 9am to head south, overfly the Gulf of Khambhat, and then the Arabian Sea, from where it turned east to cross into Mumbai over Bandra and Sion, flying south of the busy city airport.It came south of the new Navi Mumbai airport, from where it turned north and then west to carry out an approach on runway 28 and land at 10:20 am.

Poll Do you think the criticism of Bengaluru's road conditions by industry leaders and opposition parties is justified? Yes, they have a valid point No, it's exaggerated

NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah on Tuesday wrote to Wipro founder Azim Premji seeking the IT giant’s support in tackling traffic congestion on Bengaluru’s Outer Ring Road (ORR). The letter comes amid growing criticism from industry leaders and opposition parties over the city’s crumbling road infrastructure.In his letter, Siddaramaiah praised Wipro’s role in Karnataka’s development but flagged severe congestion at the Iblur junction, particularly during peak hours. He suggested that opening limited vehicular movement through Wipro’s campus, under agreed terms and security checks, could significantly ease the problem.“One of the key challenges currently facing Bengaluru, particularly along the Outer Ring Road corridor at Iblur junction is severe traffic congestion during peak hours, which adversely impacts mobility, productivity, and the quality of urban life,” Siddaramaiah wrote.Citing expert assessments, he added: “Preliminary assessments by traffic and urban mobility experts indicate that such a measure could reduce congestion on adjoining stretches of the ORR by nearly 30%, particularly during peak office hours.Your support in this matter will go a long way in easing traffic bottlenecks, enhancing commuter experience, and contributing to a more efficient and livable Bengaluru.”The chief minister urged Wipro’s management to work with state officials to find a “mutually acceptable plan at the earliest.”The appeal comes against the backdrop of heightened public debate on Bengaluru’s infrastructure. Former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai and Biocon Chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw recently urged the government to act after logistics platform BlackBuck shifted operations out of Bellandur, citing poor commuting conditions.Meanwhile, deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar has defended the government, saying the pothole problem is not unique to Karnataka. “It is there across the country, including in Delhi. Projecting in the media as if the issue is only here is not right,” he told reporters. He added that civic teams are filling around a thousand potholes daily despite heavy rains.With the opposition BJP set to stage a statewide road blockade protest on 24 September, the ruling Congress faces mounting pressure to show quick progress on improving Bengaluru’s roads.",Karnataka chief minister siddaramaiah wrote to wipro founder azim premji.

Ranthambore tiger surveillance goes dark as 11 of 12 cameras conk out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ranthambore-tiger-surveillance-goes-dark-as-11-of-12-cameras-conk-out/articleshow/124080647.cms,"JAIPUR: The high-tech surveillance system installed to track big cats and curb poaching in Ranthambore Tiger Reserve has virtually collapsed, with only one of the 12 cameras still functional. Installed under the Wildlife Surveillance and Anti-Poaching System (WS&APS), the network was designed to cover nearly 942 sq km, around 71% of the reserve.""Eleven cameras are lying defunct due to technical glitches. Despite repeated letters from the forest department to the department of information technology (DoIT), issues remain unresolved. The system was designed to provide round-the-clock monitoring of sensitive areas, but it has fallen short of its objectives due to outdated technology and insufficient maintenance of the cameras,"" a senior official said.Commissioned in 2017-18 at an estimated cost of nearly Rs 65 crore, the WS&APS was intended to track tigers and prevent illegal activities such as mining, encroachments and disappearance of wildlife.Officials said the system has become largely redundant. Unlike modern AI-enabled surveillance that can automatically detect movement and send real-time alerts, the PTZ (pan, tilt, and zoom) cameras at Ranthambore require continuous human monitoring, limiting their effectiveness.The project was ambitious in design. Each of the 12 towers, ranging from 30 to 45m in height, was meant to host five cameras with a monitoring radius of up to 5km. Drones were procured as part of the system but, according to forest officials, they were never deployed. In some locations, cameras have been inactive for over two years.Over the past three years (between June 2022 and May 2024), five tigers - T79, T131, T138, T139 and T2401 - went missing under suspicious circumstances. Activist Tapeshwar Singh Bhati said, ""This is an example of how govt wastes public money and forgets. Now they'll declare it redundant and seek new technology.""","Eleven cameras are lying defunct due to technical glitches. System was designed to provide round-the-clock monitoring of sensitive areas.

HYDERABAD: The banned CPI (Maoist)'s central committee has ordered senior neta Mallojula Venugopal, 69, to immediately surrender his weapons, warning that People's Guerrilla Army would forcibly seize them if he failed to comply.Venugopal, also known as Sonu and Bhupati, recently expressed readiness to lay down arms. Party netas dismissed his remarks as false propaganda aimed at weakening the organisation, accu-sing him of using talk of ceasefire and peace as a pretext for surrender. Telangana's Special Intelligence Branch confirmed the committee's instructions but said there was no confirmation of Venugopal's expulsion.The dispute escalated after a press release dated Aug 15 and attributed to Maoist spokesperson Abhay, suggested the group intended to ""temporarily renounce arm-ed struggle"" and ""lay down arms"". The central committee and politburo rejected the stand, insisting it was Venugopal's personal view. Traditionally, statements are issued under the alias Abhay, a role Venugopal assumed after the 2010 encounter killing of spokesperson Cherukuri Rajkumar.Venugopal has been underground since the late 1970s. A Brahmin from Telangana with a commerce degree, he is regarded more as a political ideologue than a field commander. He is the younger brother of Mallojula Koteshwar Rao, or Kishenji, a politburo member killed in a 2011 encounter in Bengal. Reports in May suggested Venugopal was preparing to surrender and reunite with his wife Tarakka, who earlier gave up arms to Maharashtra police.","Venugopal, also known as sonu and bhupati, recently expressed readiness to lay down arms.

The court directed the respondents to file their reply within four weeks.The petitioners submitted before the court that under Section 12 of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, functions of the NHRC are specifically enumerated - it may inquire suo motu, or on a petition presented by a victim or any person on his/her behalf, or on the basis of a court direction/order. However, in the present case, none of the conditions were met. It was further said Section 36(2) of the Act clearly states NHRC shall not inquire into any matter after the expiry of one year from the date on which the alleged act constituting violation of human rights is said to have been committed.The petitioners said the complaint is silent regarding the date of the alleged act constituting violation of human rights, and since the averments made therein are vague and do not disclose any specific date, it is not possible to ascertain whether the complaint was filed within one year from the date of the alleged violation.

NEW DELHI: An expert appraisal committee of the Union environment ministry has granted clearance to the 2,220MW Oju hydroelectric project located in a strategically important region in Arunachal Pradesh's Upper Subansiri district bordering China.One of the largest run-of-river hydro projects in India, it will cost around Rs 25,000 crore and is likely to take at least five years to be completed. It is India's third-largest hydroelectric project to get environmental clearance after the 3,087MW Etalin and 2,880MW Dibang project, both also in Arunachal.Oju is the largest in a series of dams proposed on Subansiri river and has been in the pipeline for nearly 20 years. It involves a 100-metre-high concrete gravity dam, over 14 km long headrace tunnel and an underground powerhouse complex.The expert appraisal committee, while giving its nod for the project earlier this month, directed the developer to include 'glacial lake outburst floods' scenarios in the design flood estimates, establish a real-time early warning system and conduct community preparedness drills. The panel has also mandated a post-commissioning environmental impact study after five years.","2,220mw oju hydroelectric project located in strategically important region in arunachal pradesh's upper subansiri district bordering china.

Polluted river water unusable even for animals

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday took suo motu cognisance of media reports about lives and livelihood of two million people being adversely impacted by severe pollution of Jojari river near Jodhpur because of discharge of untreated waste water by more than 400 steel rolling and textile units. The court said it would pass a comprehensive order on Oct 9 for the river's ""restoration"".A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta told Rajasthan's additional advocate general Siv Mangal Sharma that National Green Tribunal (NGT) has already taken cognisance of Jojari's pollution, and said remedial steps are to be taken urgently to save it. Sharma said several directions by NGT have been challenged in SC and are pending adjudication.Jojari is a seasonal river, which originates in Pandalu village of Nagaur, and after joining Luni river at Balotra flows through the limits of Jodhpur. For the past two decades, the untreated discharge of chemicals from over 400 textile and steel units has rendered the river water unusable even for animals, impacting the lives of residents of 50 villages along it Jodhpur-Barmer stretch.The river is the source of drinking water for villagers in the Thar desert.Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board also noted, ""Farmers use the water. Consumption of such agricultural products can have adverse effects on the human body as toxic heavy metals are present.""Apart from the pH value, the total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, and oil and grease quantities in the samples taken from Jojari were found to be much higher than the prescribed standards, the report said. There are reports of people migrating from villages adjoining the river because of severe water shortage. The biodiversity of the area has also suffered with flora and fauna disappearing.","Jojari’s water is used for drinking and farming in parts of thar desert.

Rampur's parkour pioneers turn ruins into launchpads,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rampurs-parkour-pioneers-turn-ruins-into-launchpads/articleshow/124080232.cms,"Members of Rampur’s Team Leonine in action

'Started off by copying

Jackie Chan

, got to know much later parkour was a sport'

MEERUT: In Rampur, a city better known for its royal past, a group of young men has turned remnants of that history into something else. Disused courtyards, locked playgrounds and Nawabi-era structures aren't tourist spots - they're practice grounds. For nearly two decades, a group of self-taught athletes has used these overlooked spaces to train in parkour long before most people here knew the word.Some of them would later carry these moves into Bollywood. Aman Kumar, who trained with the group, moved to Mumbai and began working in films. ""I've done stunts in 'Baaghi 4', 'Sultan', 'Devara' - stuff like that,"" he said. ""Directors like working with parkour artists because we don't rely on wires. We know how to land, how to adapt to real locations. There's more control, less need for editing around mistakes.""It began in 2007, when Mujahid Habib, then a teenager, realised the jumping, swinging and vaulting he did for fun had a name, and a global community. ""We used to give our moves random names, copying stunts from Jackie Chan movies,"" he said. ""Then we saw Hrithik Roshan do similar jumps in 'Dhoom 2', and my friend Waseem told me it was actually a sport, parkour.That's when I saw it as something bigger.""Habib kept practising on staircases, rooftops, drains using whatever was available. In 2009, he formed Team Leonine with five others. ""We used to go out at 5am,"" said Aamir Zameer Khan, a founding member. ""We trained on the Kosi riverbank as the sand helped with landings. Then we moved to Nahid Ground. It was always locked, so we started jumping a 10-foot-wide drain to get in.""Parkour also gave them a reason to explore their surroundings differently. ""We began looking for places that could push us - rooftops, old buildings, broken structures,"" said Hassan Khan. ""Some thought we were up to no good. Others would stop and watch. A few gave us fruit or water. It was never the same reaction twice.""They moved through Rampur, trying to read the city physically. Every alley, gate and rooftop was a chance to test technique, timing, nerves. At first, people didn't know what to make of them. Some thought they were trespassing. Others warned them to stop. ""A few even threatened to call the police,"" said Aamir. ""But some people got it. They'd bring chai or snacks. A fruit vendor once handed me a guava after watching us train all morning. ""By 2013, Habib's work had started getting noticed. That year, he won a national parkour competition in Mumbai sponsored by an energy drink brand. The prize took him to Greece, where he saw his first international event.""That trip changed how I thought about what we were doing,"" Habib said.""We had started without knowing others were doing the same. It made everything feel connected,"" he added.","Rampur's self-taught parkour athletes have been practising for nearly two decades.
