From tents to towers: Mumbai pilgrims are opting for highrise-Haj in Mina,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-tents-to-towers-mumbai-pilgrims-are-opting-for-highrise-haj-in-mina/articleshow/126330464.cms,"Former actor Sana Khan, who stepped away from the entertainment industry in 2020 and married cleric-businessman Mufti Anas the same year, is preparing for Haj later this year. It will be her fourth pilgrimage, but this one comes with a different experience.For the first time, Khan will not be staying in Mina’s famed tent city. Instead, she and her husband will spend five days in a multi-storey tower in the Mina valley, close to Mecca. The shift that reflects a transformation in how some pilgrims now experience Haj.Sana is among the first wave of Indians opting to stay at a tower in Mina during the Haj. Staying for five days at Mina, traditionally known as the ‘tent city’, is a mandatory ritual of Haj. For centuries, pilgrims from across the world who visited Mecca for the annual pilgrimage stayed in these temporary ‘khemas’ or tents.However, in the last couple of years, Saudi authorities built several towers in the Mina valley and offered pilgrims accommodation in these multi-storey towers with enhanced amenities like air-conditioned, spacious rooms, clean toilets, bigger kitchens and wider prayer areas.The Haj division of the ministry of minority affairs in India asked private Haj pilgrims to book their seats by January 15.“Timely booking will help avoid lastminute difficulties and ensure smooth, well-organised arrangements for this sacred journey,” said minority affairs minister Kiran Rijiju in an X post. Out of 1,75,000 Indian Haj quota, 52,000 will travel through Haj group organisations and private tour operators, while the rest will use services of the Haj Committee of India.Several organisers and tour operators are reaching out to affluent pilgrims with packages for an ‘upgraded Haj experience’ and the lure of ‘classic and premium packages that now include a shift from tents to Mina Towers’, reads an online ad of Al Khalid Tours and Travels. “Shift from tents to towers is being done in phases. Stay at the towers is hassle-free and suited to change in weather,” says Khalid Kherada of Al Khalid Tours and Travels.The orthodox do not approve of the transition from tents to towers at Mina.“Tents have a primitive feel, even though they’re also air-conditioned. However, Shariat, or Islamic laws, do not prescribe that the stay at Mina mandatorily be in tents,” says a senior cleric requesting anonymity.","Sana khan is among the first wave of indians opting to stay at a tower in mina during the haj.

Indian Army Intensifies Anti-Terror Ops In J&K To Flush Out Pak Terrorists Amid Chillai Kalan

SRINAGAR: In a unique initiative, the J&K govt on Saturday brought together more than 100 mosque imams to spread awareness about heroin addiction as cases of drug abuse continue to rise across the region.The imams were assembled for a workshop at the Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (IMHANS) in Srinagar. Senior officials and doctors briefed the religious leaders about their role in removing stigma from such patients in the community and encouraging them to seek medical help. They also asked them to spread awareness about harmful impacts of substance abuse in society.Divisional commissioner (Kashmir), Anshul Garg, said the active cooperation of religious scholars was crucial in sensitising people, particularly the youth, about the harmful and dangerous effects of drug abuse.“Through Friday sermons and other religious gatherings, scholars can send a strong message that drug consumption is prohibited in all religions and that it destroys individuals, families and society,” Garg said.He said the government would follow a three-stage strategy to deal with the menace, focusing on awareness campaigns, identification of drug users, and counselling and rehabilitation.Srinagar deputy commissioner Akshay Labroo said the administration is taking strong measures to curb drug abuse.Dr Arshad Hussain, head of the department of psychiatry, IMHANS-Kashmir, highlighted the growing burden of substance use disorders in the region and stressed the importance of early intervention and community participation in prevention efforts.Earlier, mental health experts in their detailed presentations on the subject.In the early years, drug addiction was rare in the Valley, they said, adding that between 1980 and 1990, only seven opium users were treated at the then psychiatric hospital, now called IMHANS-Kashmir. In 1992, the total number of substance-use patients had risen to 198. During the 1990s, doctors mostly saw patients who had become dependent on medicinal opioids prescribed or advised by chemists for sleep, anxiety and stress.By 2000, the Drug De-addiction Centre Srinagar run by IMHANS-Kashmir started seeing increasing misuse of drugs like Spasmoproxyvon, codeine and pentazocine, which were abused for their sedative effects. Then cannabis use became widespread but after 2018 a large number of users shifted to heroin. In 2020, the centre recorded 7,403 patients. In 2021, the number of new and follow-up patients rose to 23,403, and in 2022 it reached 41,110.According to the survey, “Prevalence and Pattern of Substance Use Disorders in Ten Districts of Kashmir” carried out by the IMHANS Kashmir in 2023, the Valley has estimated 67468 substance-dependent individuals. The survey said heroin is the most widely used opioid.",The imams were assembled for a workshop at the institute of mental health and neurosciences in srinagar.

NEW DELHI: In a first, India will get a twin-tube underwater tunnel that will have provision for movement of both vehicle and trains, boosting faster movement of forces and ammunition in case of any exigency, reports Dipak Dash.An inter-ministerial panel, headed by the expenditure secretary has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across Brahmaputra river in Assam connecting Gohpur and Numaligarh. One of the tubes will have provision for a single rail track.As per design, there will be no vehicular movement when trains run through this tube. It will have ballistic track and the trains will run on electricity. The total project of 33.7km, including the tunnel, approach roads and railway track will cost around Rs 18,600 crore. Once the project is complete, travel time between Gohpur and Numaligarh will reduce from current six-and-half hours to just 30 minutes, shortening the distance from 240km to 34km. This will enhance connectivity to Arunachal, Manipur, and other northeastern states.The project cost will be borne by road transport, railways and defence ministry.Designed as two unidirectional tunnels with two lanes each, these will be built 32m below Brahmaputra's deepest bed level. The project is expected to be completed in five years after the award of work.Officials said the projects will be placed before Union cabinet for approval and this may happen before Assam assembly polls. Last year, finance ministry had green signalled a road tunnel costing around Rs 14,900 crore with provision of 80:20 funding by road transport ministry and defence ministry. But following a decision to build road-cum-railway tunnels where it's feasible, govt had identified three such tunnels for North-East chicken neck corridor, across Brahmaputra in Assam and on Maranahally-Addahole (Shiradi Ghat) stretch in Karnataka, which TOI first reported on Oct 6, 2025.Officials said because of provision of railway track in one tunnel the cost has gone up.","An inter-ministerial panel has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across brahmaputra river in assam.

A tiger appeared without warning, gliding like a shadow along the forest edge as a boat drifted through the Periyar waters. For a 13-year-old boy visiting Kerala in 1957, the moment was electrifying. Wildlife then was not something confined to sanctuaries; it was visible, immediate, woven into everyday landscapes. That fleeting encounter stayed with Romulus Whitaker long before he became one of India's most influential conservationists, shaping a life devoted to understanding-and defending-creatures most people feared.Whitaker's first journey to Kerala was part of a family trip. His sister was graduating from high school, and the itinerary included Kochi, where they stayed at the Malabar Hotel, then considered the city's finest. Boat rides through rivers like the Periyar were already popular, and wildlife sightings were common. ""Gaurs and deer were easily spotted, and tigers still roamed freely at a time when hunting was legal. I never saw a king cobra on that trip, but the habit of looking closely had already taken root,"" Whitaker recalls.That fascination had formed much earlier, far from India. Growing up in northern New York State, Whitaker once watched neighbourhood boys kill a snake out of fear.""I knew more about snakes than the other kids, and that made a difference,"" he says. His mother encouraged his curiosity, buying him a book on snakes that helped replace fear with knowledge. When he later brought a live snake home, she admired it rather than panicking, calling it beautiful. An old aquarium with cracked glass became a makeshift enclosure. Without realizing it, Whitaker had taken his first step into a lifelong engagement with reptiles-a fascination that deepened after his family moved to India in the 1950s.Janaki Lenin, Whitaker's partner and co-author of his autobiography ""Snakes, Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll: My Early Years"", says writing the book gave her a deeper understanding of the extraordinary life he has lived. His schooling, she notes, was anything but conventional-camping in forests, fishing in lakes, and once even discovering a python under his bed. Boredom was never an option. If a classroom failed to hold his attention, he simply walked away to explore something more compelling outdoors. Comparing his life to her own, Lenin describes Whitaker as someone who has ""lived six or seven lifetimes in one.""Formal education never quite suited him. After finishing school, Whitaker enrolled in college but soon realized classrooms could not compete with hands-on learning. His real education began at the Miami Serpentarium under Bill Haast, the legendary snake handler who pioneered venom extraction in the United States. Working alongside Haast, Whitaker learned to handle venomous snakes, maintain them in captivity, and extract venom for medical use. ""Bill Haast was my guru,"" he says. ""He taught me respect for snakes, not just technique.""When Whitaker returned to India, he had a clear idea: The country needed a place where people could learn about snakes scientifically rather than fear them blindly. That idea took shape in 1969 with the opening of the Madras Snake Park. Visitors arrived sceptical-some expecting spectacle, others danger. Whitaker himself was often viewed as an eccentric outsider. But the park was never meant to entertain. It was an educational experiment. For the first time, ordinary people could see snakes up close, learn to identify species, and understand that most snakes were not out to harm them.Over the decades, the impact has been profound. India today has thousands of snake rescuers, a reality Whitaker views with cautious optimism. While rescue work has reduced routine killings, it has also become performative in some cases. Kerala, he notes, stands out for institutionalizing rescue work. By registering rescuers, issuing identity cards, and maintaining an online database, the state has created a system rooted in accountability and data. The model has since been adopted by Karnataka and is being replicated in Tamil Nadu Snakebite, however, remains one of India's most under-recognized public health crises. For decades, official statistics claimed around 1,400 deaths annually. A nationwide ""Million Deaths Study"" based on verbal autopsies revealed a far grimmer reality: Over 50,000 deaths every year, with nearly one million snakebite incidents. Many victims never reach hospitals, either dying en route or seeking traditional remedies instead of medical treatment.""The key word is prevention,"" Whitaker says. Simple measures-using a torch at night, wearing footwear, being cautious near pump houses-could prevent a significant proportion of bites. Improved reporting, he adds, has made it seem as though cases are increasing, when in fact awareness and documentation have improved. Treating snakebite as a medical emergency rather than a cultural or mystical phenomenon remains the biggest challenge.Few initiatives illustrate Whitaker's belief in practical, science-based solutions better than his long association with the Irula tribal community of Tamil Nadu. For generations, the Irulas survived by catching snakes for their skins. When the skin trade was banned, their livelihood vanished overnight. Working with the community, Whitaker helped develop a new model: Irula snake catchers would capture snakes, extract venom under controlled conditions, and release them back into the wild. The venom would then be supplied to pharmaceutical companies to manufacture antivenom.""They are saving lakhs of human lives,"" Whitaker says. Today, around 350 Irula families supply venom that meets India's entire antivenom requirement. For him, it remains the country's only true example of sustainable wildlife use-one that benefits both people and animals without depleting wild populations.Human-animal conflict remains one of conservation's most complex challenges. India's tiger, leopard, and crocodile populations have all increased-a remarkable achievement by global standards. But many of these animals now live outside protected forests. Leopards, in particular, thrive in agricultural landscapes, raising cubs in sugarcane fields and feeding on small animals and stray dogs. ""Leopards don't need forests the way we think they do,"" Whitaker explains. ""They've adapted to living alongside people.""Problems arise when human panic leads to capture and relocation-an intervention that often worsens conflict. Whitaker's own experience reinforced this lesson. Living on a small farm near Chennai, he once lost a dog to a leopard. His first instinct was to call the forest department. Then came the realisation: ""We moved into his territory. He didn't move into ours."" Simple precautions, like keeping dogs indoors at night, resolved the issue without endangering the cat.Lenin agrees that human-wildlife conflict is not new, but says its nature has changed. Earlier, communities managed interactions locally. ""The law took away that freedom, but the state did not fulfil its responsibility of sorting out the issue,"" she says. Many conflicts today, she argues, are effectively state-created-especially in the case of elephants, which require vast landscapes and abundant food. Habitat disruption leaves marginalized communities bearing the burden of coexistence, even though they are the least equipped to do so.Whitaker is critical of how crop-raiding wildlife is managed, particularly in Kerala, one of the few states where wild boars that devastate farmlands are legally permitted to be killed but must then be buried. Recalling ecologist Madhav Gadgil's public criticism of the policy, Whitaker questions the logic of wasting what is a valuable protein source. ""These animals can destroy paddy or peanut fields as much as an elephant does, but after killing them, you are told to bury the meat. People are always in need of protein, especially in rural areas. He recounts seeing electric fences in parts of north India where nilgai, jackals, and peacocks were killed indiscriminately and left to rot. For him, science-based preventive infrastructure works far better than reactionary measures.He regards Indira Gandhi as India's most conservation-minded Prime Minister, instrumental in legislations such as the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. ""She had come to the Snake Park in Madras in 1972, and then we told her about the problems that were happening.

Crackdown On Officials AsToll Rises To 10

Cleanest City Hit By Water Contamination As Lab Links Indore Diarrhoea Outbreak To Pipeline Leak

INDORE: The Madhya Pradesh govt removed Indore municipal commissioner Dilip Kumar Yadav and suspended additional commissioner Rohit Sisoniya on Friday, its first major action in the contaminated water tragedy in Indore's Bhagirathpura, since people began falling ill on Dec 29 in a city ranked on multiple occasions as India's cleanest. The action came on a day the death toll in the tragedy rose to 10 with the death of a 68-year-old woman.Pradeep Nigam, in-charge superintendent engineer of Indore Municipal Corporation's (IMC) water distribution department, was also removed from his post. Three additional commissioners - Akash Prakhar Singh and Ashish Kumar Pathak - were posted to the IMC after a meeting chaired by additional chief secretary Sanjay Dubey, who has been camping in Indore.Submitting a status report, the state govt, however, told the MP high court Friday that only four deaths had been recorded. Indore mayor Pushyamitra Bhargava said Friday he had information of 10 deaths due to the diarrhoea outbreak in Bhagirathpura.According to health department data, four people have died due to the diarrhoea outbreak in Bhagirathpura. However, I have received information about 10 deaths due to this outbreak,” the mayor said.“A total of 294 patients have been admitted, of which 93 have been discharged. Around 201 patients are still admitted and 32 patients are in ICUs,” the status report submitted to HC said.Hours before the IMC shake-up, CM Mohan Yadav wrote on X: “I reviewed action being taken by state govt in the Indore contaminated drinking water case with the chief secretary and other senior officials and issued necessary directions. I also discussed the report presented by the additional chief secretary in charge of the urban development department.”“We have taken the contaminated water case with utmost seriousness. We have taken action against those found guilty of negligence. There will be no compromise when it comes to health of the people. We will fix responsibility and ensure strict action,” the CM wrote on X.As the administrative changes unfolded, a flurry of activity was noticed in Bhagirathpura, where IMC workers cleaned streets and supplied water in tankers, health workers checked patients and distributed medicines, and ASHA workers conducted door-to-door surveys, checking on children. On Friday, gloom pervaded the residence of Geetabai Dhruvkar, 68. “She was admitted with diarrhoea and vomiting... Her kidneys gave way. She died Friday morning,” said her brother-in-law, Chandrashekhar Dhruvkar.Indore Municipal Corporation vehicles made announcements in Bhagirathpura asking people to avoid using tap water, which was being flushed after plugging all leakages and tested for contamination, and use tanker water.

The year 2026 is finally here and we know it will not be a routine stop on the electoral calendar. This year's calendar is filled with elections, starting with the long-overdue Mumbai-Pune civic polls. Later, with high-stakes assembly elections due in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry , it will place some of the most influential politicians under rare and sustained scrutiny. For many leaders, the results will define not just the fate of their governments and party, but also their relevance heading into the 2029 Lok Sabha elections.Across these five states and a Union Territory, regional parties are strong and national parties are testing the outer limits of their expansion. What unfolds in 2026 will reshape the party's existence, recalibrate the opposition's cohesion and test the BJP ’s claim of being a truly pan-Indian force. At the centre of it all are a dozen leaders whose careers may pivot decisively over the year.West Bengal remains one of the most politically charged battlegrounds of 2026. The pre-campaign has already started with high-voltage remarks amid the Election Commission's Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise.For Mamata Banerjee, this election comes after a decade in uninterrupted power. Having crushed the Left and successfully repelled the BJP’s surge in the 2021 assembly elections, she now faces her toughest test yet.BJP's momentum stalled in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections after it managed to win only 12 out of 40 seats. In the 2021 assembly election, it won 77 seats while TMC won the election by winning 213 seats.A fourth consecutive term would cement Mamata's status as Bengal’s long-term chief minister and one of the last regional leaders capable of stopping the BJP’s advance. But the margins matter. A slip below 200 seats from the 213 she won in 2021, or a BJP surge past the 100-seat mark, would signal vulnerability and weaken her leverage in national opposition politics ahead of 2029.Meanwhile, on the last day of 2025, Union home minister Amit Shah outlined an action plan for the party's West Bengal unit while reviewing its preparedness for the assembly polls due early next year. Addressing the party's public representatives, both past and present, Shah sought to project a unified front, while indicating former state president Dilip Ghosh as one of the main faces of the saffron camp for the elections.For Ghosh, the stakes are existential. The BJP firebrand and a former TMC heavyweight, he was central to the party’s rise to 77 seats in 2021. If the BJP crosses 120 seats in 2026, Ghosh emerges as Mamata’s undisputed challenger and Bengal’s principal alternative. Failure to capitalise on anti-incumbency, however, would raise uncomfortable questions about his influence and the BJP’s long-term strategy in the state.Tamil Nadu’s contest is shaping up as a three-cornered test of endurance, revival and disruption.Chief minister MK Stalin is seeking a second term after the DMK’s comfortable victory in 2021. Retaining a tally above 130–140 seats would keep the DMK firmly dominant and reinforce Tamil Nadu’s role as a firewall against the BJP’s national narrative. But anti-incumbency pressures, over floods, employment, law and order, and urban governance, could open space for a revival of the opposition.That revival hinges on Edappadi K Palaniswami, the former AIADMK chief minister and leader of the main opposition. A strong showing of 100-plus seats would restore the AIADMK as the DMK’s equal and slow the BJP’s attempt to subsume it. Another weak performance, however, could accelerate AIADMK’s marginalisation and strengthen the BJP’s influence within opposition politics in the state.Hovering over both is Joseph Vijay, the actor-turned-politician whose Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam is eyeing its electoral debut. Even a victory in 10–20 seats could make him a kingmaker. A failure to break through, however, would mean another failed debut and would reinforce the DMK–AIADMK duopoly.In the 2021 assembly election, DMK won 133 seats, AIADMK got 66 seats and BJP got 4 seats.Kerala’s 2026 election carries unusually high stakes for both the Left and the Congress For Pinarayi Vijayan, the CPI(M) stalwart and chief minister, the contest is about legacy. He is aiming for a historic third consecutive term—something rarely achieved in Kerala’s alternating political culture. Retaining a clear majority would keep the LDF dominant in the state and cement Vijayan’s stature as the Left’s most powerful surviving leader. But dipping below the 70-seat mark would likely end his era, especially amid criticism over governance, SFI-linked violence, and fatigue after two terms.On the other side stands VD Satheesan, the Congress-led UDF’s leader of opposition. A crossing of the 80-seat mark would flip the House and revive Congress’s credibility in the South. Another narrow loss, however, would reinforce the perception that while Congress fights hard in Kerala, BJP’s slow creep, not the UDF, is the more consequential long-term challenger.In the 2021 assembly election, the LDF won 99 seats and the UDF got 41 seats, while the NDA was unable to open its tally.Assam will test the durability of strongman politics versus generational transition.Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma is targeting a third straight NDA victory, with ambitious claims of winning over 104 of the state’s 126 seats.In 2021, Sarma delivered a decisive mandate as the BJP-led alliance won 75 seats in the 126-member assembly.Success would burnish his national ambitions and strengthen his standing as the BJP’s most assertive regional leader. But even a significant drop from the BJP’s 60 seats in 2021 would expose cracks beneath his muscular governance style, particularly amid CAA and NRC.Facing him is Gaurav Gogoi, Congress leader and son of former CM Tarun Gogoi. For Gogoi, 2026 is about emergence. A credible fight, around 40 seats for the INDIA bloc, would position him as Assam’s foremost Congress face and a potential future chief minister. A rout would risk pushing the Congress further into irrelevance in the state.Small in size but large in symbolism, Puducherry could deliver one of 2026’s most telling verdicts.Incumbent CM N Rangasamy is leading a fragile AINRC-BJP coalition and currently governing with a narrow majority secured in 2021. Retaining power would validate his long-standing role as a political kingmaker and reinforce the BJP’s power of managing complex coalition politics.For V Vaithilingam, the Congress stalwart, 2026 is a chance at revival. A UDF victory with 15 or more seats would mark a dramatic comeback for a party that once ruled Puducherry. Failure would further cement the BJP’s foothold and underline Congress’s shrinking influence in smaller southern units.Beyond state leaders, two national figures will shape the outcomes across all five battlegrounds.For, 2026 is less about immediate electoral survival and more about narrative control. With high-stakes assembly elections this year, the Prime Minister’s role will be that of a campaign anchor and message-setter across multiple states, particularly West Bengal, Assam and the southern battlegrounds where the BJP remains an outsider.A strong BJP showing in Bengal or incremental gains in Tamil Nadu and Kerala would reinforce PM Modi’s claim of leading a truly pan-Indian party heading into 2029. Conversely, stagnation or reverses in these regions would embolden the opposition’s argument that the BJP’s expansion has peaked outside its core Hindi belt. The margins, not just victories, will matter in shaping how invincible PM Modi appears in the run-up to his third Lok Sabha contest.While not a mass leader,will be one of the BJP’s most closely watched backroom strategists in 2026. As a key organisational figure tasked with strengthening party units beyond the Hindi heartland, the outcomes in West Bengal, Assam and the South will directly reflect on his effectiveness.If the BJP improves booth-level performance, vote share and cadre depth in traditionally resistant states, Nabin’s stature within the party will rise sharply. But failure to translate central leadership popularity into durable state-level structures would revive internal questions about the BJP’s organisational limits and succession planning within its second rung of leadership.For, 2026 is the culmination of ""Mission 2026"". As Union home minister and the BJP’s chief electoral architect, he is overseeing campaigns across Assam, Puducherry, Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Clean sweeps in states the BJP already governs, combined with breakthroughs in the South, would further solidify his authority.For, 2026 is a make-or-break year. After setbacks in Bihar and Delhi, strong UDF performances in Kerala or Puducherry, or credible INDIA bloc gains elsewhere, would validate his approach to coalition politics. Continued erosion would deepen doubts about his leadership at a time when Congress’s room for error is shrinking fast.For, this year will decide if she is ready to take charge of the party, as demanded by several disgruntled party leaders in the past. As Congress’s most recognisable campaigner after Rahul Gandhi, her effectiveness will be judged by how far she can convert charisma and street connect into electoral dividends, particularly in states where the party is fighting to arrest decline rather than expand.Strong UDF performances in Kerala or a credible revival in smaller battlegrounds would bolster her standing as the party's chief mobiliser.Meanwhile, in BMC elections, the Pawar senior and junior have united for the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and thehave joined hands for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls. If these reunions frutify, it could change the dynamics of mega Maharashtra alliances (MVA and Mahayuti).In 2026, people will look atwith the 'will he, won't he' question. With his constant tug of war with his own party, it will be interesting to see if Congress finally makes him fall in line with the party lines or if he calls it quits. Tharoor’s influence will also be tested by outcomes closer to home in Kerala.A Congress-led UDF victory would strengthen Tharoor’s hand within the party, renewing speculation about a larger leadership role nationally or in the state. A loss, however, would blunt his political momentum. How Tharoor positions himself during the campaign, whether as a team player or a distinct voice, will be closely parsed by both supporters and critics.Stage is all for a year of back-to-back elections that matter. In the end, 2026 will not just choose governments, it will quietly decide who still matters when the long road to 2029 truly begins.","This year's calendar is filled with elections, starting with the long-overdue mumbai-pune civic polls.

The psychology behind fraud: Why people fall prey despite knowing better,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-psychology-behind-fraud-why-people-fall-prey-despite-knowing-better/articleshow/126298769.cms,"Representative AI image

The answer lies not in ignorance, but in psychology.

​Why even cautious people fall for scams

The psychological biases scammers exploit

Emotional manipulation, she added, is equally deliberate.

Scarcity is another powerful tool.

Emotional stress blinds people

Red flags may still be visible, but the brain temporarily ignores them because emotional safety feels more urgent than accuracy. This is why scams often target people during vulnerable moments — late at night, after a loss, or during financial uncertainty. Dr Radhika Goyal, Psychologist

Emotional stress such as fear of loss, financial pressure, or loneliness activates the limbic system, particularly the amygdala, which prioritizes emotional survival responses over careful analysis. Dr Medha, Assistant Professor, Psychology

Why victims often stay silent

Breaking the psychological grip

A human vulnerability, not a personal failure

It’s easy to judge people who fell for scams. Many times, one simply thinks, “they should have known better”, label them foolish, naive, careless, or ignorant. After all, warnings are everywhere. Banks keep issuing alerts, digital platforms run awareness campaigns and news regularly reports on the latest frauds and cybercrimes.​Yet, when one looks more closely at how scams actually work, fraud is rarely the result of low intelligence or a lack of information. People who are cautious in one context can be disarmingly vulnerable in another. Those who pride themselves on scepticism can make impulsive decisions under pressure. The question, then, is not why people fail to “know better,” but why knowing better so often fails to protect them.​Scams succeed because they are engineered to move past rational judgement rather than confront it. Understanding the psychology behind fraud requires setting aside moral judgement and confronting an uncomfortable truth: vulnerability to scams is not an exception but a human trait. Frauds happen not because people are foolish, but because scammers exploit how people think, react, and cope under emotional stress.If knowledge were a substitute for preventing fraud, scams would not be this pervasive. The fact is that some of the most articulate, tech-savvy, and financially educated individuals are duped into cash transfers, sharing credentials, or clicking links that under normal circumstances they never would have trusted.The reason is that scams do not challenge what people know; they manipulate how people feel and think.As Dr Radhika Goyal, PhD (Psychology), said, in her insights shared with TOI , “Scams work by bypassing rational thinking and triggering automatic emotional responses. Even highly educated or careful individuals rely on mental shortcuts in daily life to make quick decisions. Fraudsters design situations that feel urgent, personal, or threatening, pushing the brain into ‘survival mode’.”When this happens, the emotional brain (which reacts fast) overrides the logical brain (which analyses slowly). In that moment, intelligence offers little protection, because the scam is not engaging logic, it is exploiting trust, fear, or hope.”Dr Medha, Assistant Professor of Psychology at Patna Women’s College (Autonomous), Patna University, situated this vulnerability within a well-established psychological framework, as she talked to TOI.“Even cautious, intelligent, or well-educated individuals can fall victim to scams because fraudulent schemes exploit normal psychological processes rather than ignorance. From a psychological perspective, scams function by bypassing rational thinking and activating emotional and automatic responses"" she said.She further explained this through Kahneman’s Dual-Process Theory.Fraudsters do not rely on random manipulation. They repeatedly exploit predictable cognitive biases that guide human behaviour in legitimate social settings.These biases are not flaws, they are mental shortcuts that help people function efficiently in everyday life.By pretending to be, say, a bank representative, an authority from a government department, an important executive, and short-circuiting the time it takes to reach a decision, scammers tap into compliance ahead of skepticism and reasoning. This insight into behavior is vital, because it helps to re-understand fraud not just as trickery using clever telling, but at its root, an exploitation of psychology, using guilt, fear, and other trigger mechanisms. ​​Dr Radhika Goyal identified several of the most commonly used psychological levers.Meanwhile, Dr Medha linked these tactics to foundational psychological theories. Authority-based scams, she notes, draw directly from research on obedience.“Scammers are effective because they take advantage of fundamental psychological theories that explain how humans perceive, decide, and behave in social contexts. These theories highlight that human decision-making is often guided by automatic, emotional, and socially conditioned processes rather than deliberate reasoning,” she said.Further elaborating on individual behaviour, she added, “Individuals have a strong tendency to comply with perceived authority figures. Scammers exploit this bias by impersonating officials such as bank representatives, police officers, or government agents. The presence of authority cues—formal language, uniforms, or official symbols—reduces resistance and critical questioning, leading individuals to comply even when requests are unreasonable. -This has been supported by Milgram’s theory of obedience.”“Strong emotions such as fear, hope, guilt, or affection activate the limbic system, which can overpower rational control mechanisms in the prefrontal cortex. Scammers intentionally evoke emotional reactions to impair logical evaluation and promote impulsive decisions,"" the assistant professor added, citing Damasio's Affective Decision-Making Theory.Dr Medha explained how scammers can trigger ""scarcity bias"" to trap people. Citing Cialdini's Persuasion theory, the professor explained, ""Scarcity bias occurs when people assign greater value to opportunities perceived as limited.""Scammers exploit this by saying things such as- “Offer valid for 24 hours”, “Only a few slots left”. Another tactic that fraudsters use is ""fear of missing out (FOMO)"" which ""shifts thinking from evaluation to action”, explained the professor.One of the most troubling aspects of fraud is that victims often recognise warning signs, but only in hindsight. Emotional stress plays a key role in this temporary blindness.“Emotional stress narrows attention. When someone is anxious about money, scared of legal trouble, or feeling lonely, their brain prioritizes relief over verification,"" said Dr Goyal.Further explaining the psychological mindset of the people under stress, she added, ""Under stress, people focus on solving the immediate emotional discomfort — “How do I stop this problem right now?” — instead of asking critical questions.""Dr Medha described the same process at the neurological level:Further talking about the stress factor, the professor said, “This heightened emotional arousal weakens the functioning of the prefrontal cortex, reducing logical reasoning, impulse control, and risk evaluation. As a result, individuals rely more on fast, intuitive processing rather than deliberate, analytical thinking, even when warning signs are present. Stress also narrows attention to emotionally relevant cues, causing people to overlook inconsistencies or red flags that would normally signal fraud. Consequently, the desire to quickly relieve emotional distress overrides caution, making individuals more vulnerable to deceptive tactics.”Even after realizing that they’ve been swindled, victims often opt not to speak out. In most cases, this is not because they lack information or do not care, but due to complex factors involving psychological, social, as well as structural barriers that ultimately favor the fraudsters.Shame and self-blame are some of the deterrents. Victims often internalise responsibility, believing they were “careless” or “gullible,” despite scams being deliberately engineered to exploit normal human trust and authority cues. Admitting the fraud can feel like admitting a personal failure, particularly for educated or financially savvy individuals.Fear of judgement adds to the reluctance. Victims worry about how family members, employers, or peers will see them, especially when the loss involves large sums or repeated transactions. In a professional environment, disclosure may be seen as reputationally damaging, reinforcing the instinct to stay quiet.There is also a general feeling that nothing worthwhile will come out of reporting and that what has been lost is irretrievable. This perceived futility discourages reporting, even where formal channels exist.In this context, confusion and intimidation also prevail. Frauds involve tricks and mind games that include numerous platforms, jurisdictions, and phony identities. Victims often do not know to whom they need to report, what evidence will be required, or fear being dragged into long and stressful investigations. Some are even threatened bluntly by the scammers, further suppressing disclosure.Dr Goyal pointed to shame as a central barrier. “Shame is a major barrier. Victims often blame themselves, thinking, ‘I should have known better.’ This self-blame is intensified by social stigma that equates being scammed with being foolish.”Talking about the feeling of shame leads to isolation, she added, ""Fraudsters deliberately reinforce this shame, telling victims to keep the matter confidential or warning them they will ‘get into trouble’ if they speak up. Unfortunately, silence protects the scammer and isolates the victim further. Psychologically, it is easier to stay quiet than to confront embarrassment — even when reporting could prevent harm to others. ”Meanwhile, Dr Medha explained that self-blame is deeply tied to identity. “Victims often internalize the fraud as a personal failure, believing they should have been more careful, which leads to self-blame rather than attributing responsibility to the scammer. Shame triggers avoidance behavior, causing individuals to hide the experience to protect their self-image and social identity.”“Additionally, cognitive dissonance makes it emotionally uncomfortable to admit having been deceived, especially for educated or competent individuals. Together, shame, damaged self-esteem, and fear of stigma significantly reduce the likelihood of reporting scams, despite the importance of doing so,"" she added.As scams operate at the emotional, mental level, resisting them requires psychological interruption. In general, fraud succeeds not because the victims are uninformed, but rather because jacked-up emotions temporarily displace rational judgment.Scammers create a situation that instills urgency, fear, or excitement, forcing fast decisions, narrowing attention, and suppressing doubt. In such a state, one may even fail to notice flagrant red flags. The best counter remains pause: slowing down, stepping away from the communication, or delaying any action, which breaks the emotional momentum on which scams depend.A second opinion is equally important. Bringing in a trusted third party reintroduces perspective and exposes inconsistencies that are hard to see under pressure. In practice, the strongest defences against fraud are behavioural — time, distance, and verification — rather than just knowledge.Dr Goyal emphasised on simple but effective pauses.Meanwhile, Dr Medha framed resistance as “mind over manipulation.”""Using Mind Over Manipulation — Scams succeed when emotion outruns reasoning. Breaking a scam requires slowing down emotion, widening perspective, and re-activating rational control,"" she said.She outlined concrete steps:The main point to understand in this is that fraud thrives in the space between emotion and reason. It succeeds, not because people lack intelligence, but because they are humans; capable of fear, hope, trust, and urgency. Con artists structure their approach based on these universal characteristics, taking advantage of the instances where the responses are instinctual, meaning where a reaction exceeds the boundaries of logical processing.The susceptibility to a scam is not an anomaly but a side effect of human instincts in pressing circumstances. Recognising this distinction is critical. It shifts the narrative away from personal failure and towards systemic manipulation. When victims understand that they were targeted through deliberate psychological engineering, shame loses its power and reporting becomes more likely. This, in turn, improves visibility into how fraud networks operate and where safeguards fail.The more society moves away from blaming victims and towards understanding the psychology of manipulation, the harder it becomes for fraudsters to win. Awareness framed around human vulnerability encourages openness, earlier intervention, and collective defence; thus, weakening the conditions that allow scams to spread unchecked.","Psychologist dr radhika goyal, phd (psychology), said, “scams work by bypassing rational thinking and triggering automatic emotional responses. Fraudsters design situations that feel urgent, personal, or threatening, pushing the brain into ‘survival mode’” dr radhika goyal identified several of the most commonly used psychological levers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126319854,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1451180,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

If even a Dalit icon's portrait had been installed today, we could have struck a blow against the stigma of casteism that has existed for thousands of years. But the Delhi government missed this opportunity and instead installed portraits of two Brahmins. When it comes to installing the portrait of a Dalit icon, they face so much discomfort that they initiated a privilege breach case against MLAs, some of whom are Dalits and from the AAP.""Meanwhile, AAP MLA Kuldeep Kumar said, ""A few days ago, a meeting was held in which we placed a proposal before the Assembly committee. Our MLAs said that Mata Savitribai Phule, whose birth anniversary is today, who opened the first school for women in this country, who faced immense atrocities yet never stopped educating women, should have her portrait installed inside the Delhi Assembly. I say this with great sadness that to suppress our voice, they initiated a privilege breach motion against our members, including against me personally, but they did not install Mata Savitribai Phule's portrait there. Because she spoke about educating women. Because she came from the Dalit community and the backward community, her portrait was not installed.""Pointing to contrasting decisions, Kuldeep Kumar added, ""Inside the Assembly, the entire government, along with the central government spent lakhs of rupees to install portraits of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Madan Mohan Malaviya. We have no objection to that. But we say this clearly that if you insult Dalit heroes and show hatred towards them, then we will not tolerate a BJP that insults Mata Savitribai Phule and refuses to install her portrait on her birth anniversary while installing portraits of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Madan Mohan Malaviya. This is their anti-Dalit mentality.""","Aap delhi unit chief saurabh bharadwaj and kondli mla kuldeep kumar emphasised that the government not only failed to acknowledge a dalit icon who laid the foundation of women's education in india, but also initiated a privilege breach case against mlas who raised the demand.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126325868,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-868358,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

'No change in policy'

Removing hurdles

NEW DELHI: While land acquisition, and forest and wildlife clearances are the main hurdles for delay in infrastructure projects that have been addressed by Pragati, the platform for large projects led by PM Modi, Cabinet secretary TV Somanathan made it clear Friday that development won't be at the cost of democracy.Asked about amendments to the current policy, Somanathan said: ""In a democracy we need to strike a balance... We want to implement projects with the consent of people and after public consultation.""The comment comes amid demands from a section of the business community to review the land acquisition policy to speed up the implementation of projects, with the corporate sector often citing the Chinese model of infrastructure creation.While BJP govt did seek to amend land acquisition law in its first term, it left it to the states to offer a simpler regime. Responding to a question, cabinet secretary TV Somanathan said govt has no plans to change its land acquisition policy.The data shared by Somananthan at a press conference showed 35% of 7,735 issues raised under multi-layer Pragati were related to land acquisition, followed by 20% dealing with wildlife and forest clearances.Manoj Govil, secretary coordination in the cabinet secretariat, said the average time taken for forest and wildlife clearance has come down from over 600 days to around 75 days as learnings from Pragati have been part of the administrative process.Of 382 projects reviewed by the PM in 50 meetings, almost two-thirds related to land and forest. Among the sectors, roads was on top (114 projects), followed by railways (109) and power (54). For railways and roads, at least half the issues are related to land acquisition.In a rare press conference, Somananthan said so far projects of Rs 85 lakh crore have been cleared by the PM-led panel as states and Centre have worked together to resolve the issues. Citing the example of Jammu-Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla rail link, the country's highest-ranking civil servant said the project was approved in 1994 and by the time it reached Pragati in 2015, only 40% of the work had been done. It was finally commissioned last June after being monitored at the highest level. He said had the project not been taken up under Pragati, it would have been completed only by Jan 2038.He said by removing bottlenecks, Pragati had created a platform for higher capital expenditure by govt. ""All states, irrespective of political dispensations, want to complete their projects and all chief secretaries have been very responsive in resolving issues,"" he said.On impact of review of projects by PM under this initiative, Somanathan said on average, one issue was resolved every working day after review under Pragati.Besides projects, the platform is used to review 61 govt schemes such as One Nation, One Ration Card, PM Jan Aarogya Yojna, PM Awas Yojna, PM Swanidhi Yojna, Swachh Bharat Mission, Rera, and grievances across 36 sectors were taken up for review.","Cabinet secretary tv somanathan says development won't be at cost of democracy.

PATNA: A controversy over an alleged remark by Uttarakhand minister Rekha Arya’s husband Girdhari Lal Sahu that “Bihar girls are available for marriage for Rs 20,000-Rs 25,000” deepened Saturday. MP Pappu Yadav demanded Sahu’s tongue be “chopped off”. MLA IP Gupta announced a Rs 10-lakh reward for anyone who brings Sahu to Bihar. RJD women workers burnt his effigy.The controversy erupted after a video went viral from BJP-ruled Uttarakhand in which Sahu was purportedly seen interacting with a group of young men, asking about their marital status and suggesting marriages could be arranged with “Bihar girls at low cost”.“People must chop off the tongues of persons making derogatory remarks... Either they be eliminated with speedy trials or their tongues be chopped off,” Independent Purnia MP Yadav said. He alleged that some made such statements merely for “political gains” while ignoring bigger issues of public concern and poverty.RJD activists breathed fire as they burnt Sahu’s effigy. “The protest is a warning that such comments won’t be tolerated,” an RJD spokesman said.",Controversy over alleged remark by uttarakhand minister rekha arya's husband girdhari lal sahu.

New Buddhist outfit stakes claim to being part of Ladakh talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-buddhist-outfit-stakes-claim-to-being-part-of-ladakh-talks/articleshow/126330147.cms,"NEW DELHI: Flagging a “lack of equal and inclusive representation of the Buddhist community” in ongoing talks between Ladakhi outfits and the Centre on constitutional safeguards, a new Buddhist body — Voice of Buddhist Community of Ladakh (VBL) — has sought inclusion in the dialogue to articulate the community’s concerns and aspirations.VBL was formally floated on January 1, 2026, with the backing of senior Buddhist leaders, prominent citizens, youth and women representing all regions of Ladakh. The outfit said its objective is to ensure broader and more effective representation of Buddhists in discussions with the MHA.A source said the move is aimed at ensuring that “any decision emerging from the dialogue between the Leh Apex Body and Kargil Democratic Alliance on one hand and MHA on the other keeps in mind the voice of Buddhist community of Ladakh”.While welcoming the Centre’s initiative to engage Ladakhi leaders, VBL, in a letter to Amit Shah, expressed concern over the composition of high-powered committee, which currently comprises LAB and KDA leaders. Though LAB includes representation from Ladakh Buddhist Association, VBL said Buddhists remain under-represented in HPC, undermining community’s interests in draft proposal prepared by LAB and KDA.As per sources, the draft proposal seeks statehood and 6th Schedule status for Ladakh but is silent on the demand for special status under Article 371. VBL, which opposes the demand for statehood, fears the proposal may be skewed in favour of the Kargil region.VBL said it would submit a separate draft proposal to Centre after consultations. Its convenor Skarma Namtak recently called on Ladakh LG to present the group’s demands, stressing any dialogue on Ladakh’s future must adequately reflect Buddhist concerns.","A new buddhist body — voice of buddhist community of ladakh (vbl) — has sought inclusion in the dialogue to articulate the community’s concerns and aspirations.

Meitei body writes to PM over Kuki group’s foreign outreach,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/meitei-body-writes-to-pm-over-kuki-groups-foreign-outreach/articleshow/126330103.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Meitei civil society organisation has written to PM Modi flagging concerns over letters sent by a Chin Kuki Zo group to foreign govts and United Nations bodies, warning that such outreach could undermine India’s sovereignty, judicial authority and national security amid the ongoing Manipur crisis. It urged Centre to review security policy, re-examine Suspension of Operations agreements and pursue a lawful, permanent resolution that protects all indigenous communities and Manipur’s territorial integrity. Copies of the memorandum were also marked to home minister Amit Shah.In a memorandum dated January 3, Meitei Heritage Society said communications issued by the Kuki Alliance for Nampi Awakening Movement (KANAM) seek to “delegitimise and internationalise” an order of NGT directing an immediate halt to construction of an allegedly illegal road in Manipur’s hill areas. The road — popularly referred to as the German Road or Tiger Road — was built without statutory approvals or mandatory environmental clearance and is “allegedly used by Chin Kuki Zo militants or armed groups for drug trafficking and weapons smuggling,” the memorandum said.The society argued that portraying a judicial order as “institutional violence” and “collective punishment,” and projecting it as grounds for foreign intervention, challenges India’s constitutional framework.“Such actions risk setting a dangerous precedent whereby internal judicial processes are selectively escalated to foreign govts and multilateral bodies,” it stated.The Meitei Heritage Society urged the PM to take note of the foreign communications, direct the ministry of home affairs to undertake a comprehensive policy and security review, re-examine SoO agreements with Chin Kuki Zo militant groups, and pursue a “permanent, just and lawful solution to the Manipur crisis that protects all indigenous communities and preserves Manipur and India’s territorial integrity.”Placing the issue in context, the memorandum said the Manipur crisis, which erupted into large-scale violence on May 3, 2023, has increasingly been framed through competing international narratives. It alleged that Chin Kuki Zo organisations and individuals have previously approached the UN, the US and other foreign actors with what it described as “fabricated, one-sided narratives,” while “masquerading as tribal bodies by using misleading tribal names. ”The memorandum said such groups have received financial and logistical support, training and backing from foreign Christian organisations and former US military personnel, raising questions over compliance with FCRA norms and calling for scrutiny by India’s security agencies. These actions, it alleged, contributed to radicalisation and militarisation, exacerbating crisis.","A meitei civil society organisation has written to pm modi flagging concerns over letters sent by a chin kuki zo group to foreign govts and united nations bodies.
