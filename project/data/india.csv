When 30 Becomes 15

Collective Survival Strategy

It was 2014. End-October. I was in Delhi — where I work — but needed to go back home to Bihar for the Chhath Puja. I called up a cousin, who teaches at Delhi University, hoping he could help get my waitlisted railway ticket confirmed. I still remember what he told me laughingly: “Every Bihari wants to get the hell out of the state, and now everyone’s trying to go back!” Broad generalities dispensed with, his tone turned sombre. “It’s difficult to reach Bihar, and even if you do, it will be a one-way ticket. How will you return?” My cousin, I realised, could never become a motivational speaker.Word about my unconfirmed ticket had spread in our office. I must have told someone, and then he or she must have told someone else, and so on. I think everybody feels a little better when someone else is down. Schadenfreude, pure and simple.After a miserable day at work, I headed to the Press Club. Alcohol might do you harm, but very few things come close when you are trying to drown your sorrows. You are probably thinking what a stupid thing I did, but you are wrong.I couldn’t have made a better decision. I was at the right place at the right time. A senior colleague, by now much mellowed by the effects of alcohol and having ascended a moral plane where schadenfreude had no place, spotted me and took me over to another senior journalist who could get any railway ticket confirmed. Long live the special quota.Bihar, I said, here I come.I did get on the train. I had a confirmed berth. But… Hello, what was this? A human ocean? I had seen crowds, but this was something else. Sardines, packed inside cans, probably have more space for themselves.I somehow survived, and when morning dawned, and the train chugged into Bihar, I felt... happy, maybe? After all, I was home. I had made the journey I wanted to make. But I also knew that I would never make this journey ever again.My cousin, the Delhi prof, had been partly right. There were no available tickets on the regular trains. But being an eternal pessimist, he had not budgeted for the number of special trains the Railways runs during Chhath and other festivals.I managed to get a confirmed ticket on one such train. It would leave from Patna at 8.30pm. I was in Muzaffarpur, my hometown. Strangely, on the day I was to leave, my parents insisted I leave home at 11am. “But Patna is barely 70km from here!” I argued, uncertain if my parents were showing early signs of senility or if they were truly fed up with my company.But it turned out they were approaching the 70km journey from a rooted Bihari perspective. A distance that one could reasonably expect to cover in no more than one and a half hours could often take much, much longer in Bihar. “We are speaking from experience,” my mother said.Banished with tiffin and a lecture, I set out. Within an hour I was marooned near Hajipur, facing the Mahatma Gandhi Setu — the bridge over the river Ganges that connects Hajipur in the north to Patna in the south. You hear of monster traffic jams in Delhi and Gurgaon, but this was a whole new level.I did catch the train, which — surprise, surprise — was on time, but it involved a sprint in the end, and a timely leap into the compartment as the train was gently pulling out of Patna Junction. So, net net: about 70km in nine and a half hours. Now do the maths.Once seated — unlike the train to Bihar, this had a limited number of humans on board — I dialled my mother. “You were lucky,” my mother said. “Your father’s uncle’s son-in-law once got stuck on that bridge in peak summer, AC gone, ended up admitted to a Patna hospital. His ailing father-in-law had to leave home to visit him there.”Good lord! I had been lucky indeed.Next time, I thought, I’d book a plane. Unfortunately, so did every other Bihari with a credit card, and the fares during Chhath shot up like Diwali rockets. On one visit, I landed in Patna, where an uncle picked me up from the airport and dropped me at a bus stand. I wasn’t expecting a bus like this. A gleaming, low-floor, air-conditioned govt bus to Muzaffarpur. Wow! It felt like a hallucination crafted by a particularly optimistic urban planner. I took the last seat.Seated next to me were a couple from Delhi. The conductor arrived. “Muzaffarpur,” I said. He quoted something like Rs 200. And then he winked. “For you, I will make it Rs 150.” Sure! Maybe some discount scheme. I didn’t think too much about it, just handed over Rs 150. But there was no ticket forthcoming. And then the penny dropped.The Delhi couple beside me were giving me the dagger look. And then the man took out Rs 400, and, pointedly, told the conductor: “Give us tickets, we’ll pay Rs 200 each.” The conductor looked personally betrayed. “Look at this man,” he told the bus, “insisting on paying extra.”A murmur rose — passengers, it turned out, are fiercely united against the principle of receipts. The wife asked me: “Would you do this on a DTC bus in Delhi?” The husband added, “This is why nothing works — the passengers and the staff.” Backed into a corner, the conductor printed their tickets. I felt like I needed a place to hide, something like a dark, mossy cave where no light ever entered.After half an hour, still feeling raw inside, I finally plucked up courage, and whispered to the couple: “You did the right thing, Sirji. I feel terrible.” They smiled, magnanimous in victory.On another trip, last year, I bypassed the bridge altogether and flew into Darbhanga. Outside the airport, I got on a bus to Muzaffarpur and sat beside the driver. On board were the driver, conductor, and cleaner, plus about 30 passengers. We soon pulled into a petrol pump, where a man climbed aboard to count heads. “Thirty,” he declared. The conductor laughed. “Fifteen, boss. Try again.” The man looked unconvinced until a small parcel of persuasion slid into his pocket. He cleared his throat: “Fifteen.”I, the suburban moralist, couldn’t help myself. “Won’t the owner find out?” The conductor shrugged. “He owns 200 buses. He’s not an idiot.” Pause. “This is expected. Our salaries haven’t changed in years. I’m not thinking only of me — the driver and the cleaner have families too.” He said it without malice or secrecy, someone merely stating undisputable facts like how the sun rises in the east. Strangely enough, I managed to see things from his point of view.Back in Muzaffarpur, a journalist friend offered the tidy thesis. “Bihar runs differently,” he said. “For generations, the state never really showed up. Colonial hangovers, feudal leftovers, thin institutions. People learned to get by without the system, so now the system gets by without the people. Autopilot.”I’ve replayed those trips while planning every subsequent Chhath. There’s the train that turned into a human aquarium, the endless bridge, the AC bus that looked like a mirage, the conductor’s discount that wasn’t a kindness so much as a custom, the auditor whose arithmetic improved with a little encouragement, and the conductor’s calm defence of cheating. None of this is heroic, but it also doesn’t feel villainous. It feels like a collective survival strategy.And each year I find myself plotting the same pilgrimage — rail versus road versus sky — telling myself I’ll do it better this time, knowing fully well that I most likely won’t.","Every chhath puja, returning home to bihar turns into an adventure.

New Delhi: Refuting allegations made by activist Sonam Wangchuk ’s wife against his detention under National Security Act, the Ladakh administration told Supreme Court that due process of law was followed, including informing him about grounds of arrest, and he was also allowed to meet his relatives in jail. It also informed the court that he was not being kept in solitary detention as alleged, and was medically fit.In an affidavit filed in SC, Leh district magistrate Romil Singh Donk said Wangchuk was getting legal assistance and advice in jail in preparing his representation before the advisory board against his detention.“At the outset, the answering respondent denies the baseless allegations made in the petition which suggest that Sonam Wangchuk has been detained illegally and that he is being treated improperly in the course of such detention. In this regard, it is submitted that he has been lawfully detained under a lawful authority by way of an order under Section 3(2) of NSA,” the affidavit said.“The order of detention came to be passed by me (DM) after duly considering the material placed before me, as mandated under law, and after arriving at a subjective satisfaction on the circumstances that prevailed within the local limits of the jurisdiction where he had been indulging in activities prejudicial to the security of the State, maintenance of public order and services essential to the community as mentioned in the grounds of detention,” it said.He said that the activist was “categorically informed both of the factum of his detention under the Act as well as the factum of his transfer to the Jodhpur central jail. The said factum was also immediately communicated telephonically to his wife Geetanjali Angmo through SHO, Leh police station”.The Jodhpur jail administration also filed an affidavit, saying Wangchuk had met his lawyer of choice as well as his brother and wife. “It is specifically stated that the detenue is not in solitary confinement as he is entitled to all rights available to the detenues (which are not available to persons in solitary confinement) as per Rajasthan Prison Rules,” it said.“It is imperative to note that the detenue in addition to being in completely normal health is also consuming a normal diet, and regularly consuming morning tea, breakfast, evening tea and dinner every day since his detention,” the affidavit said.",Sonam wangchuk is being held under national security act.

HC rules out giving more time to vacate Signature View apts

New Delhi: Supreme Court Tuesday ask ed ED whether its probe into the money laundering aspect of alleged massive corruption in liquor sale by Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (Tasmac) amounted to interference in the state’s affairs and federal structure of governance, leading the agency to assert that under the anti-money laundering law it is obligated to investigate cases anywhere once an FIR is registered.“What happens to the federal structure? Law & order are a state subject. Would ED investigations into FIRs lodged by state police not amount to encroaching upon police probe? Can ED go and investigate any crime relating to corruption in any state for inquiring into the money laundering aspect,” asked a bench of CJI B R Gavai & Justice K Vinod Chandran.New Delhi: A last-ditch effort by a few residents of Signature View Apartments to extend the timeline to vacate the towers failed before Delhi High Court on Tuesday as it said, “We will not put our seal at your risk.”A bench of Chief Justice DK Upadhyaya and Justice Tushar Rao Gedella pointed out that even the Supreme Court had highlighted that the buildings were in a dilapidated state. “In view of the order of the Supreme Court dated Oct 10, we are not inclined to grant any time extension,” the bench observed, dismissing the fresh plea filed by nine residents who had invoked the “mercy” jurisdiction of the court to seek a grace period.“If we extend time for you, we have to extend for all. This is a well-reasoned order; you challenged it, nothing was done. You are, in fact, under contempt. We will not put our seal at your risk; what if something happens to you tomorrow?” the bench orally observed. However, it suggested that the petitioners, several of them advocates, approach senior advocate Sanjay Jain, representing Delhi Development Authority, and left it to the agency’s discretion.Jain maintained that there was no sc ope for relief since SC itself had made observations. “The apex court said how can we take any responsibility on us if an untoward incident happens. No one can take any risk, given the fact the buildings are dilapidated,” he submitted.The high court, however, reminded Jain that the residents were “in this state” because of his client. “Let’s not forget that. People buy these flats with their hard-earned money and what do they end up with? The same issue is with other agencies, such as NBCC, pending before us,” it pointed out. In March, DDA issued a tender to demolish and reconstruct Signature View Apartments after Delhi High Court first cleared its proposal. Last week, the Supreme Court refused to entertain a plea challenging HC’s order that there would be no stay on demolition.","Hc rules out giving more time to vacate signature view apts.

"Small is strong in Bihar, as spoilsport or as kingmaker",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/small-is-strong-in-bihar-as-spoilsport-or-as-kingmaker/articleshow/124564721.cms,"New Delhi: Humbling memories of the last assembly elections serve as a cautionary tale for major parties in the two rival alliances in Bihar as they seek to accommodate demands of their smaller allies in a state with a polarised electoral battlefield where they can either play a spoilsport or multiply gains of their big brothers.BJP and JDU senior netas were huddled in Patna Tuesday to decide on which of their partners will contest on some of the seats after Chirag Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) made its claim over a few constituencies seen by the CM Nitish Kumar-led party as its backyard.LJP had drilled home the point about its disproportionately disruptive influence when it walked out of NDA to contest on its own in 2020 after its seat-share demand was snubbed by its bigger partners, especially JDU. Paswan’s party contested on 135 seats and could win only one but ensured the defeat of JDU, its primary target, in over two dozen seats, taking a heavy toll on Nitish’s political weight.For more than a decade, it was Nitish who held the balance, ensuring NDA’s electoral dominance in back to back assembly polls in 2005 and 2010, and then romping home along with RJD in 2015 before LJP struck a serious blow to its standing five years later.With both alliances enjoying a strong and committed vote bank populated by voters mostly along caste lines, a party like LJP with solid backing of over 5% Paswans can break the numerical stalemate involving big players.Newbies like Union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM can do the same in the region of his influence over votes of Mushhars, less than 3% and the poorest among SCs, and Mukesh Sahani-led Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) hopes to wield a similar influence by appealing to a group of castes, traditionally boatmen and fishermen.Unhappy with RJD, VIP had jumped to NDA’s side in 2020, when less than 15,000 votes separated the two alliances. NDA won 125 seats against opposition’s 110 but had a merely .03% higher vote share. Hurt in 2020, JDU and BJP are now treading cautiously as LJP drives a hard bargain. Things are, if anything, more complicated in ‘Mahagathbandhan’ — RJD-Congress-Left-VIP bloc.While NDA has managed a division of the number of seats among its constituents, a consensus has so far eluded the rival alliance, with the Congress driving a hard bargain on not only the number of seats it will contest but also choice of its seats.Several RJD members are unhappy with Congress for not endorsing its de facto head and former deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav as the CM face of the alliance but electoral compulsions have ensured that their party cannot brush aside the claims of Congress after playing a second fiddle to its functionary Rahul Gandhi during his ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ in Aug-Sept. Congress coupled with the Left, especially CPI-ML, and VIP can bring incremental votes to RJD, which has long enjoyed the solid support of the state’s two biggest voting blocs in Muslims and Yadavs but failed to draw enough support from other communities to ride a winning combination.As Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Party emerges as another potential disruptor in the polls scheduled for Nov 6 and 11, lead partners in both alliances try hard to protect their flanks even if it costs them a few extra seats.",Bjp and jdu senior netas were huddled in patna tuesday to decide on which of their partners will contest on some of the seats.

NEW DELHI: Keeping up the attack on the veracity of Sunjay Kapur’s will, his children from actor Karisma Kapoor told the Delhi high court on Tuesday that the document uses a “feminine pronoun” to describe him.The counsel appearing for Samaira and Kiaan Raj made the submission before Justice Jyoti Singh during the hearing of their plea challenging their father’s purported will regarding his assets, reportedly worth Rs 30,000 crore.Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani said a fundamental question is if the will was signed by Sunjay or by a woman in the declaration clause.“The author of the clause could not have been Sunjay Kapur. Clauses in question are not the handiwork or the design of the testator Sunjay Kapur. The female form of testator is used... Testator is now a ‘she’. This is an absurdity. It shows the audacity which people have to present something like this in court. In short, Sunjay Kapur signed this will as a woman?” he said. The only explanation is that it was drafted by a woman, he said.“Unless Sunjay, with an unsound mind incapable of reading... (He) could have never signed this. It is replete with feminine pronouns. It says her last will, her witness, and her presence. The feminine pronoun is used in the most crucial parts to describe him. When you get ‘she’ and ‘her’ in four places, it is incredulous that Sunjay, with all his knowledge, could have drafted this,” the counsel said.He highlighted that the children’s stepmother, Priya Kapur, who is the beneficiary, is silent on who prepared the will. “What is so secretive about it that you don’t want to give it to the beneficiaries? Our case is very clear, that this is not the testator’s will, here we have a fundamental question if the will was signed by the testator or by a woman in the declaration clause,” he added, also questioning why the will was not registered.“If Sunjay Kapur really intended to bequeath all personal assets solely to his wife, what would a man do? He would have registered the will so no one can contest it. But it is not registered,” he said.HC will resume hearing the matter on Wednesday. Last month it had asked Priya Kapur to to give a list of his assets to the court.",Samaira and kiaan raj made the submission before justice jyoti singh during the hearing of their plea challenging their father’s purported will regarding his assets.

NEW DELHI: A 31-member committee formed in the Haryana IPS officer Y Puran Kumar's alleged suicide case suicide, on Sunday, gave the Chandigarh administration and Haryana government 48 hours to remove state police chief Shatrujeet Kapur.Kapur is among the officers named by Kumar’s wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, for allegedly abetting her husband’s suicide.The committee made this demand during a mahapanchayat in Chandigarh on Sunday. Heavy police were deployed around the venue.“The Haryana DGP and former Rohtak SP should be arrested. The DGP must be removed from his post. We have given 48 hours, after which we will decide the next course of action,” a committee spokesperson told reporters, as quoted by news agency PTI.Six days have passed since Kumar, who was last posted as IG at the Police Training Centre in Rohtak’s Sunaria, died. His post-mortem and cremation have not been conducted, as the family is refusing consent until their demands are met.The mahapanchayat saw tension when former Haryana MP Raj Kumar Saini reportedly made a controversial remark, sparking anger among attendees. Calm was restored after organisers intervened.A message from Kumar’s family was read, appealing for support in their pursuit of justice. Committee members also demanded a judicial probe into the case, said Gurmail Singh, a committee member. “The family and dalit community fear that if the last rites are conducted, the government may not take action against the accused,” said Karamvir, a committee member. He also questioned the work done by the Special Investigation Team set up by Chandigarh police.Fifty-two-year-old Kumar, a 2001-batch IPS officer, allegedly shot himself at his Chandigarh home on October 7. In an eight-page note reportedly left behind, he named eight senior officers, including DGP Kapur and former Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya, accusing them of harassment and tarnishing his image. The note also mentioned caste-based discrimination.The Haryana government has transferred Bijarniya, replacing him with IPS officer Surinder Singh Bhoria.In her complaint to Chandigarh Police, Amneet P Kumar sought an FIR against Kapur and Bijarniya under Section 108 (abetment of suicide) and relevant provisions of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, demanding their arrest. She also requested amendments to the FIR to include all accused officers’ names.Haryana ministers and senior officials, including chief secretary Anurag Rastogi, recently met the family to persuade them to agree to the post-mortem and cremation.","Y puran kumar allegedly shot himself at his chandigarh home on october 7.

CHANDIGARH: Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur, in the eye of a storm following the suicide of IPS officer Y Puran Kumar, was on Monday sent on leave.Rajiv Jaitly, media adviser to Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini, confirmed the development but the official order was yet to be released till the filing of this report.The decision came past midnight —a few hours after a mega celebration in Sonipat on Friday to mark a year of the Saini govt was put on hold in view of the deepening tensions over Puran Kumar’s death. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to address the ‘Jan Vishwas-Jan Vikas’ rally.Pressure was mounting on govt to take action against Kapur, as Puran Kumar’s wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, had refused to allow autopsy or cremation until the DGP was removed. The stalemate dragged on for nearly a week.Dalit groups were piling on the pressure and a ‘mahapanchayat’ set up for justice to the family had handed an ultimatum of 48 hours, which expires on Tuesday.The top brass of Haryana govt, including chief principal secretary to CM Rajesh Khullar, held meetings with the family but the deadlock persisted. IPS officer Narendra Bijarniya, who too was named in Puran Kumar’s suicide was removed as Rohtak SP but Amneet stuck to her demand for action against the Haryana DGP.After a series of meetings on Monday that stretched till midnight, it was decided to send Kapur on leave.The aftershocks were felt on another front — govt’s plan to celebrate the first anniversary of the Saini govt.Protests by Dalit groups and growing support of opposition parties for the grieving family were casting long shadows on the event.According to sources, the decision to postpone it was taken after CM Nayab Singh Saini and chief secretary Anurag Rastogi chaired a meeting to review arrangements at the Sonipat venue.After a series of meetings on Monday that stretched till midnight, it was decided to send Kapur on leave.

He was also due to attend a programme in Nuh on Tuesday.Chandigarh Police, continuing their investigation, have served a notice to IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, widow of the deceased, asking her to submit her late husband’s laptop to the Special Investigation Team (SIT).The laptop is reportedly where Kumar had drafted his suicide note, which remains saved in the device’s drafts.Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi is due to visit the family on Tuesday. So will Union minister from Bihar, Chirag Paswan.Politicians from across the country are making a beeline to visit the Kumar household in Chandigarh to console the grieving family.Union minister of state for social justice and empowerment Ramdas Athawale and Telangana deputy CM Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka met the deceased officer’s wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, in the morning.After meeting the family, Athawale said he has assured them of all support and that the entire country’s SC community is awaiting action against the officers responsible for Kumar’s suicide. Later, Athawale also met Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini and discussed the case. Both Athawale and Paswan are allies of ruling BJP.The Telangana deputy CM criticised Haryana govt for ‘inaction’ in the case. Puran Kumar was a native of Telangana.“In his dying declaration, the deceased named Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur and SP Narendra Bijarnia, accusing them of humiliation and harassment leading to his suicide. As per law, a suicide note is treated as a dying declaration, warranting strict action. However, Haryana authorities have failed to act, which is both pathetic and inhuman. I demand that Haryana and Centre take immediate action against both officers,” Vikramarka said.K Raju, AICC in charge of Jharkhand Congress, alleged that authorities are not complying with the constitutional provision that provides for equality before law. “Action against senior officers responsible for driving the IPS officer to suicide is not being taken as they are high ranking officers. Delay in action is lowering the morale of the educated Dalit youth of the country,” he said.Punjab ministers Harbhajan Singh, Harpal Singh Cheema, Mohinder Bhagat and Dr Ravjot Singh visited the family, along with former Lok Sabha MP Prem Singh Chandumajra. Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) president Abhay Chautala also consoled the family.The Sarva Khap Maha Panchayat has also announced support to the deceased IPS officer’s family. Pawanjeet Bhanwala, spokesperson for Sarv Jatiya Sarv Khap Mahapanchayat and Jat Mahasabha, said that a meeting of Sarv Khap will be held on Tuesday at Narwana in Jind district.",Haryana dgp shatrujeet kapur sent on leave.

NEW DELHI: Since the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) announced its seat-sharing for the upcoming Bihar elections, the regional party alliances seem to be sending mixed signals.While Lok Janshakti Party's (LJP) Chirag Paswan and Rashtriya Lok Morcha's Upendra Kushwaha said all is well, hinting at a smooth alliance, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) Jitan Ram Manjhi’s latest post raised a few eyebrows again, after he said that the seat-sharing had ""weakened"" the morale of the workers.The mood swings began over NDA's seat-sharing arrangement which gave LJP(RV) 29 seats, HAM and RLM on six seats each. Meanwhile, BJP JD(U) got an equal share of 101 seats each.However, leaders of Bihar’s ruling NDA said that seat-sharing arrangements within the coalition have been amicably resolved, with discussions on which party will contest specific seats now entering the final stages.HAM chief Manjhi has not shied away from expressing his dissatisfaction repeatedly, with recently saying that the seat-sharing had ""weakened"" the morale of the workers and left them with ""deep dissatisfaction.""""It is true that we have secured fewer seats, the morale of our workers is weakened, and there is deep dissatisfaction among the workers, which I can only assure them will be compensated for in the future,"" he said in a post on X on Tuesday.However, he expressed confidence in NDA's victory in Bihar saying: But this does not mean that we should push Bihar towards lawlessness. It does not mean that we should rob the people of Bihar of their peaceful nights and their daytime tranquillity.For Bihar, for the people of Bihar, for the pride and honour of Biharis… We are all ready… The NDA will triumph, and Bihar’s honour will endure… 'Victory to Modi, Destined for Nitish',"" he said.Earlier, he had warned of ""repercussions"" in NDA saying, ""What the high command decided, we accept, but by giving six seats, they have undervalued us, it may have repercussions in NDA.""Manjhi had demanded 15 seats for his party.Both Chirag Paswan and Upendra Kushwaha said that the issue of seat allocation among NDA parties had been resolved through ""amicable discussions.""""The issue of seat allocation among NDA parties has been resolved through amicable discussions.

""One corrupt police officer in Sadar police station took money. A RS 50 crore deal was made to get Rao Inderjeet removed. On the other hand, there was one honest police officer — Narendra Vijania — who stood up to this corruption. No one had ever been posted for so many days in front of him because he was not corrupt; he was honest.

But they started manipulating the posting quotas.

They began tampering with files in the village, introducing errors deliberately. If you check the CDR and IPDR of the women police transfer case, you will see that I am telling the truth — absolutely the truth. I am not lying.

They have created such a corrupt system that nothing happens transparently. Are you sitting on the chair of justice or not? People are being asked to pay to get postings. This is not governance. Today, I am revealing the truth: the roots of their corruption run very deep. Complaints had been filed against this corruption. Out of fear of this very corruption, this suicide happened.

Let me tell you one more thing: when we caught Sushil, he was doing monthly collections. The money was brought in the car, hidden in the dashboard by the driver Dharmendra. In that car were Ramendra and Sushil Kumar — two men. When they were caught, they were given notice to appear for investigation. They said, “No problem, we will come in 10–12 minutes.”

But the reality was different. To protect his family from political harm, he committed suicide. It’s not as simple as people think. He belonged to a powerful caste, had cars, and feared that if this corruption scandal exploded, everything would be exposed.

His father and others sitting in the commission were all involved in corruption. They too should be investigated. They distributed licences through corrupt practices. I am telling the truth — Sushil received money from THC in Sonaria. The money was kept in the car’s dashboard. That money was taken. What I am saying is the truth.

I am speaking out for the people of this country. I feel I must stand with honesty. I am honest. I might be a landlord’s son, but I am not corrupt. Today, to awaken the public and the nation, this has become necessary.

The fight for truth must continue. Shame on those relatives of the corrupt who are sitting in power and trying to twist this into a caste issue to exert pressure. A businessman’s family is being suppressed because they stood against crime. Their truth is being silenced. A huge truth is being stopped from coming out. But I will not let that happen.

The truth must prevail. Those who have done wrong will face the consequences. With this, I bid goodbye, friends. If i’ll return in next life, i’ll to continue to fight for this cause.""

According to news agency PTI, aspirants who apparently received phone calls from the party began pouring in, only to emerge minutes later with the party symbol in their hands and a broad smile on their faces.Prominent among those who got RJD symbols were Sunil Singh (Parbatta), who quit chief minister Nitish Kumar's JD(U) last week, and Narendra Kumar Singh alias Bogo, a several-term former MLA from Matihani, who had won the seat twice for the party headed by the CM.However, Lalu's son Tejashwi, who is also Mahagathbandhan's chairman was supposedly upset with his father's decision. He stopped the distribution well past midnight and asked the leaders to return the party symbols.Tejashwi told his father that photographs and video clips of party candidates with the symbol could not go down well with alliance partners with whom a deal was yet to be struck, PTI reported citing sources.This is not the first time Lalu has distributed tickets to his party leaders without a nod from alliance partners. Ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, he had given tickets to several RJD leaders well before Congress , RJD, and Left parties had reached a seat-sharing agreement. However, the alliance partners eventually fell in line.This comes as Lalu's son Tejashwi met Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi on Monday evening and is learnt to have discussed a seat-sharing arrangement ahead of the Bihar assembly polls. Congress general secretary (Organisation) K C Venugopal and the party's in-charge for Bihar, Krishna Allavaru, were present during the meeting at Kharge's residence, PTI reported, citing sources.Sources said Tejashwi Yadav had earlier held discussions with Allavaru and Venugopal, where Bihar Congress chief Rajesh Ram and CLP leader in the Bihar Vidhan Sabha Shakeel Ahmad Khan were also present.The Mahagathbandhan in Bihar is likely to make a formal announcement ""latest by Tuesday evening"" since Tejashwi was himself likely to file his nomination papers from Raghopur on Wednesday.In the upcoming elections, Congress is likely to get fewer seats than last time due to its dismal performance in the 2020 assembly polls, when it won 19 out of the 70 seats it contested. The RJD contested 144 seats and bagged 75 in the 243-member assembly.On the other side, BJP state in-charge Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday announced that JD(U) and BJP will contest 101 seats each; Chirag Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vikas) on 29 seats; and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) of Jitan Ram Manjhi and the Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM) of Upendra Kushwaha will contest six seats each.Bihar assembly polls are slated in two phases on November 6 and 11, and the counting of votes will be conducted on November 14.

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah Tuesday laid the foundation stone for the NSG ’s Special Operations Training Centre (SOTC) in Manesar which is being built over eight acres at a cost of Rs 141 crore to provide state-of-the-art training to special commandos of NSG as well as anti-terror task forces of state/UT police, in combating terrorism.Speaking at the ceremony at NSG’s headquarters whose campus will house the SOTC, Shah said multiple surgical strikes undertaken by the Indian security forces to bring perpetrators of terror acts, including those based on foreign soil, to justice have proven that terrorists are not safe anywhere in world and will be tracked down and punished irrespective of the jurisdiction.Addressing the 41st Foundation Day of the anti-terror force, he said the Modi govt, through actions like the scrapping of Article 370, surgical strikes, air strikes, and Operation Sindoor has dealt severe blows to the core of terrorist networks. “Our security agencies have proven that they will track down and punish terrorists even in the depths of hell (paatal)… Operation Sindoor destroyed the headquarters of Pakistani terror groups planning attacks on India, along with their training camps and launch pads. Operation Mahadev eliminated perpetrators of the Pahalgam terrorist attack, thereby boosting the nation’s confidence in our security forces,” he said.Praising the NSG for its courage and dedication in anti-terror operations during 26/11 attacks and the Akshardham attack, Shah announced govt will bring significant changes to the NSG’s operations in the coming days. He said a seventh NSG hub will come up in Ayodhya, adding to ones already established at Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Jammu.“In a vast country like India, central govt alone cannot tackle terrorism; rather, all state govts, special units of state police forces, NSG, and all Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) must work together to ensure the country’s safety,” Shah said while addressing the event attended by NSG chief Bhrigu Srinivasan, home secretary and Intelligence Bureau director.Highlighting the steps taken by Modi govt since 2019 to sharpen its anti-terror response, Shah said the legal framework was strengthened with amendments to (UAPA) and NIA Act.",Home minister amit shah laid the foundation stone for the nsg ’s special operations training centre (sotc) in manesar.

‘Country will be free of Naxalism by 2026,’ Amit Shah, calls on Maoists to give up arms

NEW DELHI: The surrender by CPI(Maoist) politburo member Mallojula Venugopal alias Sonu along with senior and mid-level cadres is being seen as a sign of a vertical split in the Naxal outfit already grappling with an erosion in its leadership and armed strength as well as a rapidly-shrinking arc of influence.The split was evident when Sonu took the initiative to announce on behalf of the CPI(Maoist) central committee, a willingness of armed cadres to lay down weapons and explore the prospects of peace talks with the Centre; only to be disowned by the Telangana state committee, central committee and a section of Dandkarenya special zonal committee (DKSZC).In statements issued subsequently, the latter labelled Sonu’s view in favour of a temporary ceasefire and peace talks as his “individual opinion’ and not the collective view of the CPI(Maoist) leadership. They even described him as a traitor who was not authorised by the outfit to issue a statement under the generic nom de guerre ‘Abhay’ used by its spokesperson.A senior Chhattisgarh govt official told TOI, “The split in Maoist ranks became obvious when the north and west sub-zonal bureau of DKSZC supported Sonu’s stand on denouncing violent extremism and joining the mainstream. However, the south sub-zonal bureau of DKSZC and Telangana state committee opposed it; the main leaders in this camp are Thippiri Tirupathi alias Dev ji, believed to have stepped in as CPI (Maoist) general secretary following the neutralisation of Nambala Keshava Rao alias Basavaraju earlier this year, Chandranna and Hidma etc.The stand of Odisha state committee and Jharkhand faction is not clear on this issue, though”.The fissures in CPI(Maoist) top leadership —also fuelled by an apparent succession tussle between Devji and Sonu — may have come at an opportune time for the anti-Naxal forces as they move closer to the target of eliminating armed Left-wing extremism (LWE) from the country by March 31, 2026. Following Sonu’s surrender, the politburo’s strength is down to just three — comprising general secy Dev ji, his aged predecessor Muppalla Laxman Rao alias Ganpathy and Misir Besra, a rare Jharkhand representative in the CPI(Maoist) apex body where the Telugu-speaking ideologues have always held sway.“The end of violent Naxalism is near. The intensified counter-operations by Chhattisgarh police and the Central forces in the core Naxal area across Abujmarh region have jolted the Maoist leadership and cadres, leaving them with only two options — surrender and join the mainstream or face elimination,” Chhattisgarh chief minister Vishnu Deo Sai told TOI on Tuesday.The surrender by Sonu, which follows months after his sister in law and central committee member Sujata joined the mainstream, also shows that pragmatism may be replacing ideological affinity.Home minister Amit Shah has already ruled out any ceasefire with the Maoists.",The surrender by cpi(maoist) politburo member mallojula venugopal alias sonu along with senior and mid-level cadres is being seen as a sign of a vertical split in the naxal outfit.
