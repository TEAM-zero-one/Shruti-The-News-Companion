'You reap what you sow'

Chirag tries to meet Paras, but fails

How will the BJP react?

'I have saved the party'

NEW DELHI: In a surprise turn of events, Chirag Paswan , the president of Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) founded by his father late Ram Vilas Paswan , was on Monday unceremoniusly unseated as the leader of the party in Lok Sabha.Chirag, who took over the mantle of the party in 2020 after the death of Ram Vilas Paswan, stood completely isolated at the top within his party.Five of the six members of Parliament of the LJP revolted against Chirag in an overnight coup and elected Pashupati Kumar Paras, his uncle, as the new leader of the party in Lok Sabha.Besides Pashupati Paras, the rebel group includes Chirag's cousin Prince Raj, Chandan Singh, Veena Devi and Mehboob Ali Kaiser.The group has already met Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to inform him about the changes in the party. In the coming days, the rebels may stake claim in the Election Commission to represent the real LJP and could also move to oust Chirag from the top party post. Nitish Kumar 's party, the Janta Dal (United), reacted with a sense of vindication to the deveopments within the LJP.Chirag had led an aggressive anti-Nitish Kumar campaign in the 2020 assembly elections and in the process dealt a heavy political blow to the ruling Janta Dal (United) inChirag walked out of the NDA in the state and contested the assembly elections against Nitish Kumar's party. He fielded nominees, some of them BJP rebels, against all the JD(U) candidates.As a result, the JD(U) ended up losing several seats due to triangular contest and for the first time it became the junior partner to the BJP in Bihar NDA.Little wonder, Nitish Kumar's party reacted with a dig at the developments within the LJP.""You reap what you sow,"" said JD(U)national president RCP Singh as he blamed Chirag for doing negative politics.""Chirag Paswan has committed so many blunders in the recent past. The people of Bihar and his own party workers and leaders were not happy with whatever he did during the Bihar assembly election. Now, it's results are coming in the form of a split in the party,"" Singh said.Given the bitter political rivalry between the two parties since the 2020 assembly elections, sources close to Chirag Paswan accused the JD(U) for the split in the LJP.The JD(U), on the other hand, blamed Chirag Paswan's negative politics for the rift within his party.The lone LJP MLA in the Bihar assembly has already left the party to join the JD(U).As the events unfolded on Monday, Chirag Paswan drove to his uncle's residence in the national capital to meet him and Prince Raj.Paswan, who has not been keeping well for some time, waited for over 20 minutes in his car before he was let into the house and then left after spending more than an hour inside.He left without saying a word to waiting media persons.It is believed that neither of the two rebel MPs met him. A household help said the two were not at home when the LJP chief arrived.It would be interesting to see as to how the BJP reacts to the latest developments in this game of one-upmanship between the JD(U) and the LJP in Bihar.Chirag Paswan has all along kept a very strong pro-BJP and pro-PM Modi stand and announced ahead of assembly elections that he is working for a BJP government in Bihar.Pashupati Paras, on the other hand, is percieved as pro-Nitish Kumar.Paras today lauded Nitish Kumar as a good leader and ""vikas purush"" (development-oriented man).With talks of Union Cabinet reshuffle, it would be interesting to see if the BJP decides to include Chirag Paswan to ensure that he is not completely marginalised within his own party.The JD(U) has declined to comment on speculations about one or more rebel LJP MPs being inducted into the Union cabinet from the party quota or getting accommodated in the state ministry.However, it has reiterated the party stand that all NDA allies ought to get a ""respectable"" share at the Centre.Pashupati Paras, who is an MP from Hajipur, a seat represented by Ram Vilas Paswan for several years, caimed that 99 per cent of LJP workers were unhappy with the leadership of Chirag Paswan in Bihar.""There are six MPs in our party. It was the desire of five MPs to save our party. So, I have not broken the party. I have saved it. Chirag Paswan is my nephew as well as the party's national president. I have no objection against him,"" Paras said when asked about the developments.Paras said his group will continue to be part of the BJP-led NDA, and added that Paswan can remain in the organisation.Regarding the rumours that LJP will be joining the Janta Dal (United) in Bihar, the Hajipur MP said, ""Existence of LJP will continue, we are not joining JDU. We will fulfill the ambition of Late Ramvilas Paswan.""",Lok janshakti party (ljp) chief chirag paswan failed to meet pashupati kumar paras at his house in new delhi.

Investigators: 80 CCTV dashboards compromised

AHMEDABAD: A single default password - ""admin123"" - was all it took to unlock a national nightmare. What began at Payal Maternity Hospital in Rajkot as a case of careless digital housekeeping spiralled into one of India's most disturbing cyber scandals. Hackers breached the hospital's CCTV system through its default admin login, stole hours of intimate footage of women being examined in the gynaecology ward, and fed it into an international porn fetish network for profit.The access logs spanned nearly a year, from Jan 2024 through early Dec 2024, until the perpetrators were arrested this Feb. The hackers were able to steal at least 50,000 clips over nine months from across the country.The scam came to light after teaser clips from the Rajkot facility were posted online on YouTube channels like ""Megha Mbbs"" and ""cp monda"". Customers were led to Telegram groups to buy the footage, for anything between Rs 700 and Rs 4,000. Investigators found about ""80 CCTV dashboards compromised nationwide, including in Pune, Mumbai, Nashik, Surat, Ahmedabad, and Delhi"". The victims ranged across 20 states, spanning hospitals, schools, corporate houses, cinema halls, factories, and even private residences.Despite the primary arrests being made earlier in 2025, investigators found that these illegally obtained clips were still available on Telegram groups until at least June.Investigators found that many of these CCTV systems still used factory-set passwords like ""admin123"".An Ahmedabad cybercrime branch officer told TOI: ""The primary method used was a 'brute force attack' (hackers using a program or bot to try every possible combination of letters and numbers for a lock).""Parit Dhameliya, the lead hacker in the operation, a BCom graduate, employed three different software programs to achieve this. With stolen credentials, another accused, Rohit Sisodiya - who was later arrested in Delhi and used a diploma in medical laboratory technology as a cover - used a tool meant for legitimate remote viewing to input stolen login details and gain unauthorised access to the hospital's cameras.","A single default password - ""admin123"" - was all it took to unlock a national nightmare.

‘Create Apmaan Mantralaya’: Priyanka Gandhi Takes Dig At PM Modi Over Insult Claims In Bihar Rally

Tharoor flags ‘Family Business’ in Indian politics

BJP seizes on Tharoor’s remarks

Congress hits back:

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has praised senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor ’s latest article criticising dynastic politics, using it to target the Gandhi family and the Congress leadership.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla called the piece “insightful” and hailed Tharoor as a “Khatron ke Khiladi” for directly questioning political succession in his own party.In his essay titled “Indian Politics Are a Family Business” published on Project Syndicate, Tharoor described dynastic politics as a “grave threat to Indian democracy” and urged India to move toward “meritocracy.”He argued that leadership in the Congress and other INDIA bloc parties including the Samajwadi Party, RJD, Shiv Sena (UBT) and DMK has often passed from one generation to the next.Tharoor wrote that from Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi to Rajiv Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the Nehru-Gandhi family has cemented the idea that political leadership can be a “birthright.”""For decades, one family has towered over Indian politics. The influence of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty - including independent India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, prime ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, and current opposition leader Rahul Gandhi and MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra - is bound up with the history of India's struggle for freedom. But it has also cemented the idea that political leadership can be a birthright,"" his article read.He also cited examples of other political families including Uddhav and Aaditya Thackeray in Maharashtra, Mulayam Singh and Akhilesh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh, Farooq and Omar Abdullah in Jammu and Kashmir and M Karunanidhi and MK Stalin in Tamil Nadu to highlight how dynastic politics extends beyond the Congress party.Responding to the essay, BJP’s Shehzad Poonawalla said it “rightly exposes how the Gandhi family turned Indian politics into a family business.”Speaking to ANI, Poonawalla said, ""A very insightful piece has been written by Dr Tharoor on how Indian politics has become family business and in the opening of that piece he has explained how the first family of Congress party, the Gandhi-Vadra dynasty has been responsible for cementing this negative thought that political position and power can be a matter of birth right.""In a post on X, Poonawalla wrote, “Dr Tharoor has become Khatron ke Khiladi. He has directly called out Nepo Kids or Nawabs of Nepotism. Sir, when I called out Nepo Naamdar Rahul Gandhi in 2017, you know what happened to me. Praying for you… The first family is very vengeful.”He also added, “Very insightful piece written by Dr Shashi Tharoor on how Indian politics has become a family business — he has launched a direct attack on India’s Nepo kid Rahul & chhota nepo kid Tejashwi Yadav!”Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan welcomed Tharoor’s remarks, saying they were based on “experience” and would “hurt Congress and RJD because their politics are limited to family.”Congress leaders Rashid Alvi played down the controversy, saying dynastic politics exists across fields, not just in politics.Speaking to reporters, he said: ""The public makes the decisions in a democracy... You cannot impose a restriction that says you cannot contest elections because your father was an MP.... This is happening in every field... What way will you find for this?...""Tharoor has previously faced criticism from Congress party for praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s “energy, dynamism and willingness to engage,” calling them “a prime asset for India on the global stage.”Tharoor’s recent alignment with the ruling party on several occasions, a noticeable departure from the Congress partyline, has drawn significant attention. Notably, he was selected to lead India’s diplomatic outreach under Operation Sindoor, representing the nation’s stance on the global stage. He headed the delegation to several countries across the Americas, including the United States.","Bjp spokesperson shehzad poonawalla hails tharoor as a “khatron ke khiladi” for directly questioning political succession in his own party.

Zubeen Garg Death: CM Clarifies Cause, Fans Recall His Love For Water

Himanta claim in Zubeen case follows reports from Singapore

GUWAHATI: Cultural icon Zubeen Garg's death in Singapore on Sept 19 has been officially treated as a murder case from day one, Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Monday, setting Dec 8 as the deadline for the special investigation team to file its chargesheet with clearance from MHA.""Today, I am not calling it an accident,"" Sarma told reporters. ""As the state's home minister, I get to know what I need to know. Whatever I say, I do so with conviction.""On whether that meant investigators had found evidence Zubeen didn't die in a swimming accident, Sarma said, ""This is not a new revelation from me... Everyone currently in judicial custody has been charged with murder."" Sarma said he briefed home minister Amit Shah on the probe during his visit to Delhi Sunday.Himanta said he requested speedy clearance from MHA for the chargesheet to be filed. The SIT, headed by CID's special DGP MP Gupta, will write to MHA with details within 2-3 days. ""Since the incident occurred on foreign soil, we need prior approval from the ministry before filing the chargesheet.""MP and PCC president Gaurav Gogoi demanded to know what prompted Sarma to explicitly say for the first time that Zubeen didn't die in an accident.""Now, he claims it was murder, but he hasn't told the public how or why it happened,"" Gogoi said, questioning what he said was ""lack of clarity and transparency in the govt's handling of the case"".Sarma had previously only hinted that Zubeen's death while swimming off an island in Singapore may not have been accidental, leading the opposition to ask how he could say so when the chargesheet was still to be filed.The CM's statement came days after Singapore Police Force handed over the final autopsy and toxicology reports to the SIT. Sarma described these reports as ""authentic"" proof of the cause of Zubeen's death, given these tests were conducted immediately after he was declared dead in a hospital there.Zubeen's friend and fellow singer Manas Robin expressed shock at the CM's statement, saying he couldn't have imagined anyone from Assam would target the icon.""The timing of the CM's statement suggests he is not lying. Speaking openly to the public and calling it a murder - there must be some truth in it,"" he said. ""We expect the maximum punishment for the culprits if it was murder."" Seven suspects are in judicial custody, including North East India Festival organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta and Zubeen's manager Siddhartha Sharma. Four of them were with Zubeen on the yacht that took him to Lazarus Island. Over 60 FIRs have been filed across Assam in the case.","Assam cm himanta biswa sarma sets dec 8 as the deadline for the special investigation team to file its chargesheet.

12 OD deaths in India every week: NCRB,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/12-od-deaths-in-india-every-week-ncrb/articleshow/125069465.cms,"Representative image

BENGALURU: In 2023, the latest year for which data is available, at least 12 people died every week in India on average due to drug overdose, NCRB data reveals. That is nearly two deaths daily. Between 2019 and 2023, 3,290 deaths were attributed to the same cause, with the average for the five-year period remaining roughly the same as in 2023.What makes this data particularly sobering is what it doesn't capture. These figures represent only confirmed drug overdose deaths - they don't account for unreported cases and deaths misattributed to other causes. Also, NCRB doesn't specify if the overdose involved a narcotic substance or prescription drugs.Psychiatrists, clinicians and retired police officers TOI spoke to said there needs to be more clarity in the classification of drug overdose cases. They pointed out that in many of these cases, there could have been an overuse of prescription drugs such as sleeping pills or painkillers.The figures tell a story of volatility rather than steady decline. After recording 704 deaths in 2019, the country saw a sharp drop to 514 deaths in 2020, likely influenced by Covid-induced lockdowns.The number of deaths surged to 737 in 2021 - the highest in the five-year period - before moderating to 681 in 2022, and 654 in 2023.Tamil Nadu dominated the statistics in the early years of this period. In 2019, it recorded 108 deaths, the highest in the country. The figure tapered to 110 in 2020, before spiking to 250 deaths in 2021. Since then, however, the state has seen a remarkable reversal. Deaths dropped to just 50 in 2022 and rose marginally to touch 65 in 2023.Punjab, sharing a porous border with Pakistan that has long been a conduit for drug trafficking, has maintained a consistently high position in the rankings. While it didn't feature among the top five states in 2019, it recorded 34 deaths in 2020. The figures more than doubled to 78 in 2021, before touching 144 in 2022 - making it the state with the maximum overdose deaths that year. In 2023, though deaths fell to 89, it still topped the national list.Rajasthan has shown a troubling consistency in terms of deaths. Starting with 60 deaths in 2019, the state's toll climbed to 92 in 2020. It reached 113 in 2021 and rose to 117 in 2022. While the deaths declined slightly to 84 in 2023, Rajasthan has remained in the top five every year, occupying second or third positions throughout the period.Madhya Pradesh wasn't among the top five in 2019 or 2020 but emerged in the list with 34 deaths in 2021. This figure was 74 in 2022 and rose again to 85 in 2023, making it the second-highest state in the most recent year.Mizoram and Manipur have appeared intermittently in the top five. Mizoram saw 30 deaths in 2020 and 61 in 2022, while Manipur saw 36 deaths in 2021. Karnataka was in top five in 2019, with 67 deaths, and in 2020, with 36.","In 2023, the latest year for which data is available, at least 12 people died every week in india on average due to drug overdose.

EC To Launch SIR in 12 States and UTs in Phase 2, CEC Gyanesh Kumar Says Zero Complaints in Bihar

DMK in SC: SIR exercise can disenfranchise lakhs of voters

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu's governing party DMK on Monday filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court challenging the constitutional validity of the Election Commission 's decision to conduct special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls of all states.It alleged that SIR is an arbitrary exercise that would lead to removal of voters' names from the lists.DMK said a special summary revision of TN voter list was conducted between Oct 2024 and January 2025.The revision had addressed issues of migration, death and deletion of ineligible voters from the existing state electoral roll.""The SIR and the Orders, if not set aside, can arbitrarily and without due process, disenfranchise lakhs of voters from electing their representatives, thereby disrupting free and fair elections and democracy in the country, which are part of the basic structure of the Constitution,"" said DMK said through its organising secretary R S Bharathi.DMK said the Bihar SIR was carried out by introducing new and stringent requirements for voters to provide proof of citizenship, particularly for those who were not registered as voters in the 2003 electoral roll.It cited several orders of the SC, tweaking the procedure and allowing Aadhaar as an identity proof.DMK and said the procedure adopted by EC in conducting SIR is neither prescribed in the Representation of the People Act nor in Conduct of Election Rules.""There is neither a necessity for conducting de novo verification of electoral rolls nor a compelling reason for such extensive exercise."" it said. DMK said, ""...SIR is bound to cause uncertainty and disenfranchisement of a significant number of voters, as seen in Bihar"", a charge yet not accepted by the SC, which is still seized of the matter.",Tamil nadu's governing party dmk filed a writ petition in the supreme court.

"Opened after 54 years, Banke Bihari treasury reveals dust, raises doubts; SC-appointed panel is now auditing assets of temple",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opened-after-54-years-banke-bihari-treasury-reveals-dust-raises-doubts-sc-appointed-panel-is-now-auditing-assets-of-temple/articleshow/125027537.cms,"SC-Appointed Panel Is Now Auditing Assets Of Temple

MATHURA: The long-sealed treasury - toshakhana - of Vrindavan's Banke Bihari temple, believed to hold royal gifts, ornaments and centuries-old offerings, was opened last month after 54 years on the orders of an SC-appointed panel tasked with overseeing the temple's financial, structural and administrative functioning. But what emerged from the vault shocked many: one gold and three silver bars and utensils. With no inventory or donor records, the panel has launched the temple's first full asset audit, covering bank deposits worth up to Rs 400 crore, sealed lockers, land holdings and donation records - as questions mount over where the ""missing treasure"" is.Like on every Dhanteras, on Oct 18, the priest lit a small earthen lamp and placed it at the foot of the door of the treasury. The wood had darkened, carvings dulled, a panel eaten halfway by termites. No key had survived and a metal cutter was brought in. Snake catchers moved in first as forest officials stood by with oxygen cylinders. Behind the panels - sealed for more than five decades - lay the toshakhana.When it opened, there was no gold crown as expected. Or a gemstone necklace. Just a long wooden box containing a single gold bar and three silver bars streaked faintly with vermilion.Around them, there were brass utensils, wooden trays, and layers of dust so thick that one official described it as ""undisturbed for generations"". The chamber yielded no spectacle. But what it did offer was unsettling - the near-total absence of any official record of what had once been kept there: no donor register, no inventory, no valuation documents, and no reconciliation with decades of temple offerings.The toshakhana, last opened in 1971, had been spoken of for years in reverent tones - a place where ornaments, royal gifts from Bharatpur, Karauli and Gwalior, land deeds and handwritten letters were believed to lie, donated by kings and commoners to ""Thakurji"". Instead, the inventory was strikingly thin and sparked disbelief among devotees, demands for a CBI probe from locals, and a quiet but unmistakable scrutiny of the shrine's financial history.As of now, the items found in the toshakhana have not been formally valued, though they have been sealed. No FIR has been filed, and no report has been made public. ""The audit is on. This is the first official attempt to document the temple's assets,"" said a senior official associated with the panel. ""We don't have the full inventory yet. Even the panel is trying to find out. A CA firm has been appointed.""Banke Bihari temple, founded in 1864 by followers of saint and musician Swami Haridas, receives some 50,000 visitors a day - a number that rises to several lakhs on festivals and auspicious days. Yet unlike temples in the south, whose wealth was historically documented and regulated under systems of royal patronage and formal audits, Banke Bihari has evolved with a structure rooted in tradition rather than regulation. Offerings - jewellery, land, cash - have come in over generations, but few comprehensive records exist to track them.Among devotees, reactions have been mixed. ""My devotion is to the deity, not to any treasure,"" said Ramesh Patel, a Surat-based cloth trader who visits Vrindavan two or three times a year. ""Yes, I too was expecting something spectacular. But I am not disappointed. We hope all the assets will eventually be documented."" Others, however, have gone further. Dinesh Falhari, a local, has written to PM Narendra Modi seeking a CBI probe. Several residents in the vicinity have echoed the concern.The committee, chaired by retired HC judge Ashok Kumar, was formed after a series of PILs raised concerns over crowd management and administrative lapses. The recent vault opening has prompted the panel to expand its scope and begin a full structural and financial audit - the temple's first.As per official estimates, the temple holds between Rs 350 to 400 crore across over 10 bank accounts in Mathura and Vrindavan, most currently in Multi-Option Deposit form - a product that offers lower interest rates than fixed deposits. The panel has directed that these accounts be converted into FDs for better returns and asked bank officials to submit details of the temple's funds and their status.The audit has also raised questions about assets held outside the temple premises. While members of the Goswami community - hereditary sevayats who manage rituals and daily operations - acknowledge that jewellery had once been deposited in SBI's Mathura branch, there is no documentation on when this was done or what was deposited. ""Still not with us,"" said the official. ""The Goswamis say the jewellery is there. But no order to open the lockers has been given yet. We don't have a list of items, and there is no record of valuation.""There is no exhaustive list of temple-owned land, income from leases, or encroachment details. Officials have said that the local tehsildar and SDM have been asked to retrieve land records from around the temple. The temple manager has also been asked to prepare a consolidated report of all bank accounts, financial assets and donation receipts before the panel's next meeting on Nov 19.Within the sevayat community, there is growing discomfort over public speculation around the temple's finances. ""People are comparing Banke Bihari with temples in the south,"" said Shailendra Goswami, a member of the committee and part of the lineage of Swami Haridas. ""But those temples were built by kings. Our's was built in stages, in 1864, with around Rs 70,000 collected from devotees. Even the large Hindola (rocking cradle) was made from offerings. Some of Bihariji's jewellery is in the SBI branch - this has been shared with the committee. No one can make a single accusation against the priests.""Three of the four Goswami members who are part of the high-powered committee confirmed that their concerns had been placed on record at the committee's Oct 29 meeting. Among the issues discussed was the crowd situation and the perception being created around the vault opening. ""This is Bihariji's temple,"" one of them said. ""The service is done by love. Let them do their audit. We have nothing to hide.""","Sc-appointed panel is now auditing assets of vrindavan's banke bihari temple. With no inventory or donor records, the panel has launched the temple's first full asset audit.

(ANI)

JAMMU: J&K CM Omar Abdullah on Monday said the age-old “Darbar Move” tradition, discontinued four years ago, was revived by his government to bridge the gap between the twin capitals of the erstwhile state — Jammu and Srinagar.The “Darbar Move” bi-annual tradition of shifting the J&K government offices from Srinagar to Jammu in winter and vice-versa in summer was started by Dogra rulers nearly 150 years ago. In June 2021, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha halted the practice, citing the administration’s complete transition to e-office, which, he claimed, would save approximately Rs 200 crore annually.The tradition was revived by the Abdullah govt on Oct 16.On Monday, CM Abdullah, accompanied by deputy CM Surinder Choudhary and minister Javed Rana, walked approximately 4-5 kms from his official residence on Wazarat Road (Residency Road) in Jammu to the Civil Secretariat in the morning, interacting with traders on Residency Road, Raghunath Bazaar and Shalimar Road on the way.“Jammu suffered the biggest setback since the Darbar Move practice was discontinued. The National Conference had promised to restore it.It was our responsibility, and we have done it today. We hope that with the resumption of the Darbar Move, the economy of not only Jammu but the entire J&K will get a boost,” Omar told reporters. “You must have seen the rousing reception. Today, a distance that takes a few minutes to cover took nearly an hour. It was the love and affection of the people.”Abdullah said some people always try to create a wedge between Jammu and Srinagar and rake up “Jammu versus Kashmir” for political advantage. “We want to address that wedge and remove the distance,” he said.The decision to discontinue the practice in 2021 had drawn sharp criticism from various quarters, including Jammu’s business community, which had termed the move a blow to trade and the traditional bond between the two regions. The trading community had been pressing for the revival of the practice ever since.Abdullah said the tradition was revived by his government to bridge the gap between the twin capitals of the erstwhile state and asserted that some things “should not be weighed by money”.“Everything should not be weighed in money. The ‘Darbar Move’ was stopped to save money. Some things are more than money, as they involve sentiments and unity between the two regions of Jammu and Kashmir ,” he said.","The ‘darbar move’ bi-annual tradition of shifting the j&k government offices from srinagar to jammu in winter and vice-versa in summer was started by dogra rulers nearly 150 years ago.

RJD hits back at PM Modi

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday stepped up his attack on the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in poll-bound Bihar, questioning why the person responsible for bringing “jungle raj” (lawlessness) to the state is ""missing"" from the party’s posters.Although he did not name anyone, the remark was a clear reference to RJD chief and former Bihar chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav.“Look at the posters of the RJD and the Congress. The pictures of the person who brought ‘jungle raj’ to Bihar are either missing altogether or so tiny that they can’t be seen even with binoculars,” PM Modi said at a rally in Katihar.“The one who is such a big leader of the RJD, whose entire family is in politics — why are his pictures not being used?” he asked.PM Modi went on to question why Lalu Prasad Yadav’s son, Tejashwi, was ""reluctant"" to mention his own father’s name.“Why are you so ashamed to take your father’s name? What is the wrongdoing that the RJD feels compelled to hide from Bihar’s youth?” he remarked, without naming Tejashwi, the chief ministerial candidate of the RJD-led opposition Mahagathbandhan, which includes the Congress and other allies.The term “jungle raj” is frequently used by political opponents to attack Lalu Prasad Yadav, Tejashwi Yadav, and the RJD.The RJD hit back at PM Modi, with both Tejashwi Yadav and his sister Misa Bharti taking aim at the prime minister.""PM Modi should talk about the 14 crore people of Bihar, why is he talking about useless things? The kind of profit Lalu Yadav has given to the Railways, PM Modi cannot do that even in 7 births,"" the Mahagathbandhan CM face retorted.""PM Modi has come for Bihar elections or to search for Lalu Yadav's photos? The fear of Lau Yadav has not come out of the minds of NDA leaders and PM Modi. On one side the prime minister of the country talks about 'katta' and on the other side, Tejashwi Yadav talks about providing employment to the youth,"" Bharti remarked.Bihar will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and 11, with counting scheduled for November 14.

SRINAGAR: The Jammu and Kashmir high court on Friday quashed the preventive detention of a man booked under the Public Safety Act (PSA) for alleged involvement in anti-national activities.The detainee, Sajad Ahmad Bhat of Drabgam, Pulwama, was represented by Zameer Abdullah and Zahir Abdullah, the two sons of J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah According to the judgment, Bhat was placed under preventive detention after being accused in FIR No. 119 of 2020 at Police Station Rajpora for offences punishable under the Indian Arms Act and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.The Pulwama district magistrate, in a detention order on April 30, 2025, had stated that Bhat had “re-activated his contacts” and was “in close touch with active terrorists in the area”, enabling them to evade arrest. The order had described his activities as “highly prejudicial to the security of the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir” and warranting preventive detention under the PSA.Pleading before a single bench of Justice Moksha Khajuria Kazmi, the defence lawyers argued that Bhat had already been arrested in the 2020 FIR and was later released on bail by a competent court on Nov 13, 2023 in the case.In its order, the HC observed that “the counsel for the petitioner have successfully shown that the detainee had been granted bail by a competent court of law, and the impugned detention order, based on the same FIR, is an outcome of stale allegations”.The bench said the detention order issued in 2025 was based on a case registered in 2020, terming it “stale” and lacking a “proximate link” between the alleged actions and the present security situation.The HC directed that the petition be allowed, the detention order be quashed and the respondents directed to release the detainee forthwith if not required in any other case.The judgment comes at a time when PDP president Mehbooba Mufti has moved the HC seeking the return to the UT of all undertrials held in jails outside Jammu and Kashmir.Outside the HC in Jammu on Monday, Mehbooba said they were hoping that the elected govt would take action on the issue of undertrial prisoners lodged in jails outside J&K.National Conference, however, used the judgment to criticise Mehbooba. “While Mehbooba Mufti opts for theatrics with zero benefit to those under detention, Zamir and Zahir quietly do the real work, offering help, legal aid, and support without the drama. What’s needed isn’t noise outside courts but action inside them,” NC spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq said. “National Conference remains committed to advocating the release of those with minor or no charges, and to ensuring that others lodged in distant jails across the country are brought back to J&K,” he said.","Sajad ahmad bhat of drabgam, pulwama, was represented by zameer abdullah and zahir abdullah, the two sons of j&k chief minister omar abdullah.

Assam Police Slaps Murder Charge On Zubeen Garg’s Manager & Festival Organiser

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday claimed that state icon and celebrated singer Zubeen Garg was ""murdered,"" even as investigations into the case remain underway.Garg died under mysterious circumstances while swimming in the sea in Singapore on September 19. He had travelled there to attend the fourth edition of the North East India Festival (NEIF).“I am not calling it an accident. The charge-sheet in this murder case must be submitted by December 17, but I have set a target to file it by December 8. We are ready now,” Sarma told reporters, according to news agency PTI.The chief minister, however, did not disclose what prompted investigators to classify the case as murder. Special Investigation Team (SIT) under the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the Assam Police is probing Garg’s death after more than 60 FIRs were lodged across the state.Meanwhile, Sarma added that he had met Union home minister Amit Shah to seek expedited approval to file a charge-sheet in the case, as Ministry of Home Affairs' (MHA) permission is required to file a charge-sheet in incidents that occur abroad.“Yesterday, I met the Union home minister to fast-track the process.The SIT will approach the MHA within the next three to four days to seek the necessary clearance before filing the charge-sheet,” he stated.When asked whether the Assam government had extended any financial assistance to the NEIF, Sarma replied it had not.Those arrested in connection with the case include NEIF chief organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta, Garg’s manager Siddharth Sharma, and two band members — Shekhar Jyoti Goswami and Amrit Prabha Mahanta. The singer’s cousin, Assam Police DSP Sandipan Garg, was later taken into custody as well.Two of Garg’s personal security officers, Nandeswar Bora and Prabin Baishya, were also arrested after police uncovered alleged financial transactions worth over Rs 1.1 crore in their accounts.All seven accused are currently in judicial custody and have been booked under various sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) for murder, culpable homicide not amounting to murder, criminal conspiracy, and causing death by negligence.",Zubeen garg died under mysterious circumstances while swimming in the sea in singapore.
