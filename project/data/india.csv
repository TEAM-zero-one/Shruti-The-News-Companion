Idol immersion: JCB deployed to pull out trolley

INDORE: Vijayadashami celebrations ended in a tragedy as 11 people, mostly teenagers, drowned on Thursday evening when a tractor-trolley carrying devotees who had gone for Durga idol immersion overturned in a pond in Ardala village of MP’s Khandwa district. The accident took place when the tractor-trolley, carrying about 20-25 people, lost balance and toppled into the water.Officials said a local kotwar had cautioned the driver against taking the tractor-trolley into the water body, but the warning was ignored. The vehicle, while reversing, likely hit a stone and overturned, throwing all occupants into the pond. Many managed to swim to safety, but 11 could not be rescued, said DIG Bahuguna.CM Mohan Yadav expressed grief over the loss of lives and announced an ex gratia of Rs 4 lakh each for the families of the deceased. Khandwa DIG Siddharth Bahuguna said seven of the deceased were females and that there were eight minors among the dead.Three others were admitted to hospital. One remains critical while the other two are out of danger,” Khandwa DIG Siddharth Bahuguna said. Rescue operations began immediately, with police, administration and local teams rushing to the spot. A JCB machine was deployed to pull out the trolley. By 6pm, 10 bodies had been recovered, and after a three-hour search, the body of the last missing child — an eight-year-old girl — was found around 8.45pm.","A tractor-trolley carrying devotees who had gone for durga idol immersion overturned in a pond in ardala village of mp’s khandwa district.

Police Lathicharge Protesters After Violence Breaks Out In Bareilly During ‘I Love Muhammad’ March

Govt using police to silence victims, oppn: Bhim Army chief

MEERUT/BAREILLY: Internet services, including mobile data, broadband and SMS services, were suspended across Bareilly on Thursday afternoon amid fears of unrest on Friday when people will gather to offer juma namaz. According to a govt notification, internet services will remain suspended in Bareilly from 3 pm on Oct 2 to 3 pm on Oct 4.Security has been tightened across four districts in Bareilly division, with heavy deployment of forces on streets and drones in air. Some sensitive areas in the city looked like fortresses, and many roads and lanes in localities remained deserted.City magistrate Alankar Agnihotri said, “Internet will remain suspended for 48 hours, considering the sensitivity of the situation.” The precaution follows last week’s clashes during a procession after Friday prayers over ‘I Love Muhammad’ row. Police resorted to lathi charge to control the situation. So far, over 80 people, including local cleric and Ittehad-e-Millat Council president Tauqeer Raza Khan, his close associates Dr Nafees Khan and Nadeem Khan, have been arrested.On Thursday, Ala Hazrat Association urged the people to offer Friday namaz peacefully and return home promptly.From the Sunni Markaz at Dargah Ala Hazrat, Jamaat Raza-e-Mustafa national vice-president Salman Hasan Khan appealed to imams and the public to maintain peace, avoid rumours and cooperate with authorities. He also requested special prayers during Friday sermons for harmony.In Muslim-majority areas fears of impending action by the administration prevailed. Teams from Bareilly Development Authority are surveying properties to identify violations. Structures without approved maps or violating building regulations will face notices, sealing and demolition.The authority’s vice-chairman Manikandan A said, “Action is being taken at every level against those accused of rioting and their supporters. Every illegal brick will be accounted for. This drive will serve as a lesson to accused and a warning to others who break the law”.In Saharanpur, Chandrashekhar Azad was put under house arrest as he was planning to meet families of those affected in last week’s violence. Azad accused govt of “using police to silence victims and opposition voices” and demanded an impartial probe into the violence.“Following a letter from Bareilly district magistrate, police force from Fatehpur and Dehat police stations were deployed outside Azad’s house in Chhutmalpur area of Saharanpur. His presence in Bareilly might lead to law-and-order issues in that city,” Saharanpur SSP Ashish Tiwari told TOI.On Wednesday, two Congress leaders — Saharanpur MP Imran Masood and former MP from Amroha Kunwar Danish Ali —were put under house arrest to stop them from visiting Bareilly.","Internet services, including mobile data, broadband and sms services, were suspended across bareilly on thursday afternoon.

Cong-ress netas Mallikarjun Kharge, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi paid tribute to Gandhi.Citing the second volume of the book by Gandhi’s secretary Pyarelal, ‘Mahatma Gandhi: The Last Phase’, spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said the description of RSS as a communal body came in his conversation with a colleague on Sept 12, 1947, and five months later, then Union home minister Sardar Patel banned RSS.Ramesh said Patel, on Dec 16, 1948, spoke at the Congress session in Jaipur. “He warned that any organisation which sought to supplant the national flag by another would be sternly dealt with,” stated a report, attached in his X post.","Mahatma gandhi called rss a ‘communal body with totalitarian outlook’, congress says.

NEW DELHI: A scuffle broke out between ABVP and Left-affiliated outfits and charges and counter-charges were traded in JNU over a Ravan Dahan and a Durga immersion on Thursday.The Leftist outfits alleged that an effigy of former students Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam - who are facing trial in a 2020 Delhi riots case - along with Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru, was burnt during a Ravan Dahan. They accused ABVP of communal propaganda. ABVP, on the other hand, alleged that its Durga immersion procession was attacked.Videos from the campus showed groups of students raising slogans and flashing slippers, while security personnel formed a chain to prevent an escalation.TOI was unable to independently confirm the details of the two events.ABVP said the effigy burning was symbolic of the end of ""Naxalism, Leftism, Maoist violence and anti-national ideologies"". Khalid, Imam, Guru and Naxal movement leaders Charu Mazumdar and Kanu Sanyal had replaced Ravan's heads. ABVP, on the other hand, said the Left groups threw stones and abused students at the Durga Visarjan.

Poll Should there be stricter regulations on how schools discipline students? Yes, to protect student rights. No, schools need the freedom to manage behavior.

'Pakistan Could Not Kill Him But...': Father On Kargil War Veteran Killed In Ladakh Clashes

Poll Do you think Ladakh should have more local governance powers? Yes, more autonomy is needed No, current administration is sufficient

LEH: At Martyrs’ Park, about 1km from the Ladakh Hill Development Council (LAHDC-Leh) office, the gate stood open during curfew relaxation. Inside, chairs were stacked and a tent was dismantled. Labourers were quietly loading chairs, tent covers and iron rods into a vehicle, their faces grim.It was here that environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk began a 35-day hunger strike Sept 10, demanding Sixth Schedule protections and statehood for Ladakh. “We provide tents on rent. They called us to take it back,” a worker said. Startled at the sight of a reporter, he said, “Please go away, cops will come and we will be in trouble.”A woman entered with her child. “I was on hunger strike on Sept 24 when the situation worsened outside,” she said. “Out of fear, some of us ran in different directions. My husband later picked me up. I came back to collect my belongings.”On Sept 24, security forces opened fire on protesters demanding Sixth Schedule status, killing four and injuring dozens. Wangchuk called off his hunger strike hours later. Authorities said the police fired in self-defence after protesters tried to set ablaze a vehicle carrying security personnel.Police also claimed that without CRPF deployment, “the whole of Leh would have burnt”.Outside the park, another woman voiced her anger. “Why were people fired upon? Four people are dead. Will they give us Sixth Schedule?”About 1km away BJP’s Ladakh office, which was set on fire, was under heavy guard with spools of concertina wire around it. Cops prohibit photography of the building.At the LAHDC-Leh office, the main gate was open but there was no one there. “Since Sept 24, chief executive officer Tashi Gyalson and others haven’t come to office. In fact, no one comes,” a peon said.Mustafa Ladakhi, 36, a PhD from JNU, is among a growing number of Ladakhis at the country’s top universities concerned about home. At a hotel near Leh airport, he said the region is still in shock.“On Sept 24, my mother was on a hunger strike led by Wangchuk. There was chaos when she called me. I found her in the middle of the road. I will never forget the pain that day brought to Ladakhis,” he said. “No official has stepped down. There is no empathy. There is no apology. Instead, we are accused in the national media of destabilising the central govt... How can we be a threat when we have paid with our lives for the nation?”He argued that UT status without statehood had buried local governance under bureaucracy. “Instead of empowering local govt, we have the lieutenant governor’s office and its bureaucracy, commissioner secretaries, the DC’s office, and the police bureaucracy. They have nothing to do in Ladakh. All we see is pomp and a show of bureaucracy... Allow us to govern ourselves,” he said.“When we were part of J&K, AFSPA was never extended to Ladakh because govt knew we were Indian nationalists. Why this labelling now?” he asked.Ladakhi’s friend, a hotel owner, said, “I don’t want to talk about tourism. This is a colossal tragedy. Four deaths in a place like Ladakh are like 400 in Delhi. Sept 24 will remain etched in our memory.”In Upper Tukchal area of Leh, Rigzin Wangmo Lachic, president of All Ladakh Hotel and Guest House Association, echoed similar sentiments and demanded a judicial inquiry. “The events have shattered us and left a wound on our collective soul,” she said.At a hotel serving Kashmiri wazwan on Oct 1, during curfew relaxation, the receptionist from Doda said he no longer felt safe. “I’ve been here 10 years and never faced hostility. But after the lieutenant governor described workers from Doda and Nepal as ‘external forces’ responsible for the crisis, we are not stepping out much.”As curfew returned, shops shut ahead of the 6 pm deadline. “We comply with every direction. But govt must fulfil our four demands, including Sixth Schedule and statehood,” Gelek Punchok, 42, a member of Leh Apex Body, said. Punchok was outside the district jail, with many others, to receive around 26 prisoners released Thursday after they were given bail. Many of the released detainees said they had nothing to do with the Sept 24 violence but stated that they were with the “peaceful” struggle for Sixth Schedule status and statehood.","Environmental activist sonam wangchuk began a 35-day hunger strike sept 10.

NEW DELHI: Trading company Wintrack Inc has levelled serious allegations of corruption and harassment against customs officials in Chennai and announced that it is halting exports and imports from the country, prompting the revenue department to initiate a probe by a senior official.In an eight-minute video posted on X on Thursday, the company’s CEO, Prawin Ganeshan, who described himself as a first-generation entrepreneur sourcing goods from China, has enumerated a series of events starting in Jan, when he first raised a red flag over a bribery demand of Rs 8 lakh from customs officials for a $1,300 package. He alleged an official from Delhi faceless assessment unit had made the demand, but the issue was resolved after he raised it on X. The posts were deleted subsequently, he said.Then in May, when three of his consignments were held up, he paid a bribe of Rs 3 lakh to two units, though not to those working in the “shed”, he alleged. Despite paying the bribe his goods were released after three weeks, he added. Things deteriorated from June when officials in the “shed” refused to clear goods and demanded a bribe of Rs 1.5 lakh, citing payments made to other departments.Since then, Ganeshan alleged, the officials had been raising issues and lodging complaints with seniors.He then floated a company in his wife’s name, and the first consignment was cleared. “When the second shipment came, the officer in the shed refused to examine the shipment and it is still pending,” Ganeshan said in the video and accused a deputy commissioner in the “shed” of threatening his company representatives. “I heard that they are planning revenge, planning to raid and affect my personal life,” he said.The video was posted a day after Chennai Customs, on its official X handle, described the earlier allegations as false. While taking note of the Chennai Customs’ response, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs stepped in, promising necessary action. The finance ministry said a detailed investigation by a senior revenue department official had been ordered.","Trading company wintrack inc has levelled serious allegations of corruption and harassment against customs officials in chennai.

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray took a veiled jab at Maharashtra deputy CM Eknath Shinde saying that while ""attempts were made to break Shiv Sena,"" those who deserted the party were “brass,” and only the loyal ones who stayed with him were “gold.”Speaking during a Dussehra rally in Mumbai on Thursday, he accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of 'vote chori', communal politics, terming it an ""amoeba"" for the society. ""The Centre has money to buy votes in Bihar but does not have funds for rain-ravaged Maharashtra,"" he said.He also demanded the central government to extend funds for rain-ravaged Maharashtra, including loan waivers and Rs 50, 000 aid per hectare for rain-hit farmers, PTI reported.Without directly naming anyone, Thackeray said, ""Attempts were always made to break Shiv Sena. But those who have run away are brass and those who are still here with me are gold.""The Shiv Sena’s 2022 split left the party divided between factions led by Eknath Shinde and Uddhav Thackeray, the former retaining the original name and symbol, and the latter continuing as Shiv Sena (UBT).While both camps have claimed the legacy of Bal Thackeray, Shinde has accused Uddhav of abandoning the party’s core values of Hindutva and Marathi pride, questioning his contribution to the “Marathi manoos” during his two-decade control of the BMC.Referring to his alliance with Raj Thackeray's MNS , he assured that the two parties ""came together to stay together.""The party chief vowed to expose BJP's ""loot"" of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), if voted to power.""After winning civic polls, we will come out with White Paper on BJP's 'loot' of BMC,"" he said.

BENGALURU: Karnataka HC has overturned a state administrative tribunal’s reinstatement of a village accountant removed from his job over bribery allegations, distinguishing between an “honourable acquittal and one secured on benefit of doubt”.HC concluded that the tribunal shouldn’t have considered acquittal in the criminal case under benefit of doubt, noting the burden of proving misconduct lies with the employer in departmental proceedings.Shivanagouda Vasanad was compulsorily retired after a departmental inquiry found the charges correct. The accountant in Bagalkot district was caught in Nov 2011 accepting Rs 2,500 for executing a mutation entry. In May 2021, a special court acquitted Vasanad in the criminal case.Subsequently, he approached Karnataka State Administrative Tribunal, which rescinded his compulsory retirement in April 2023. Govt appealed in HC, asserting the tribunal’s consideration of the acquittal, which was not an honourable one, was improper since the departmental inquiry had proved the charges.","Karnataka hc has overturned a state administrative tribunal’s reinstatement of a village accountant removed from his job over bribery allegations.

The girl revealed the accused committed forcible sexual acts on many occasions.The defence argued it was a consensual relationship and sought minimum sentence as the accused is an orphan.

NIRF to begin negative marking for dishonesty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nirf-to-begin-negative-marking-for-dishonesty/articleshow/124278793.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: Centre is rewriting the rulebook for India’s National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), in what could be the sharpest overhaul of the country’s higher education rankings since their inception in 2015. For the first time, penalties are being formally stitched into the ranking methodology, signalling a tougher stance on research malpractice and misrepresentation of data. The negative marking system will soon be declared.This year, the framework docked some marks from an institute’s overall score if published papers were retracted by academic journals. From the coming year, though, the consequences will be deeper and wider. Not only will universities be penalised for retracted work, but even citations of such tainted papers will draw heavy deductions in the research score — effectively broadening the circle of accountability.The change is aimed at curbing what officials describe as a “weakness” in India’s research ecosystem. Papers withdrawn for plagiarism, duplication or manipulated data often continue to be cited, giving them a false academic afterlife.“Retractions damage the credibility of the system.And when retracted papers are cited, they really hold no meaning. And hence, such instances need to be doubly punished with harsher negative marks,” said professor Anil Sahasrabudhe, chairman of the ranking committee. By extending penalties to citations, he explained, govt is signalling zero tolerance towards dishonesty in academic output.The revised rules will also push institutions to institute stronger internal checks. Universities that persistently accumulate lapses may face the ultimate penalty — being struck off the rankings altogether. “While the final decision to debar institutes that continue to deliberately misrepresent has not yet been taken, the committee is serious about such cases and is likely to consider harsh measures,” added Sahasrabudhe.“Rankings are signals to students, employers, investors of faith in an institution. To be rubbed off the table would mean more than a bruise to reputation; it may mean a shut door to opportunity,” said an official.NIRF evaluates institutions across five broad parameters: teaching and learning, graduation outcomes, research, outreach and perception. With over 8,700 institutions participating in the 2024 cycle, its results have become a widely referenced barometer for students, recruiters and policymakers.Experts point out the higher education sector is at a crossroads: on the one hand, the country seeks a larger global footprint in research and innovation, and on the other, it must work to weed out malpractice that risks damaging credibility. Sharper rules, they argue, are a warning and an opportunity. Universities need to invest in ethics training, plagiarism detection systems & transparent review mechanisms, lest a single tainted citation pull down their standing, said Sahasrabudhe.","For the first time, penalties are being formally stitched into the ranking methodology.
