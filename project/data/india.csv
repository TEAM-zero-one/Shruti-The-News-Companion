Owaisi Slams MCD Demolition, Says Turkman Gate Land Fully Belongs To Waqf

New Delhi: Supreme Court has said offering of prayers by Muslims at premises not included on the list of auqaf cannot give it the character of a mosque and ruled unless the mosque stood over waqf land, waqf tribunal could not entertain a suit to declare the place a mosque.The ground floor of an apartment on prime land in Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, was claimed to be a mosque since 2008 but the owner of the land and the builder of the apartments stopped access to it in 2021.One Mohammed Ahmed filed a suit before the waqf tribunal seeking to restrain Habib Alladin and others from causing hindrance to those visiting the Mahmood Habib Masjid and Islamic Centre. The owner of the plot moved Telangana HC, claiming the building plan made no mention of the area in dispute as a mosque and, hence, the tribunal could not have entertained the suit. The HC had rejected the plea.After analysing judgments on the issue, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and K Vinod Chandran said, “A reading of Section 6 and 7 (of Waqf Act, 1995) makes it clear that the jurisdiction, to determine whether or not a property is a waqf property, or whether a waqf is a Shia waqf or a Sunni waqf, inheres in the tribunal only if the particular property is specified as waqf property in the ‘list of auqaf’.”The bench said, “A bare reading of the plaint would indicate that neither is the property specified in the ‘list of auqaf’ as published in Chapter II nor registered under Chapter V and hence the decision as to whether the property is a waqf property or not cannot be decided by the tribunal since the property is not one specified in the ‘list of auqaf’, which is the mandatory requirement... to approach the tribunal.”SC said, “We will not consider the issue as to whether the property can be deemed to be a ‘waqf by user’ since the question is still at large.” It set aside the tribunal order assuming jurisdiction and the HC order affirming it.","The ground floor of an apartment on prime land in banjara hills, hyderabad, was claimed to be a mosque since 2008.

Lucknow: Akhilesh On UGC Rules, SC Stay Sparks Student Debate, Sambhal Police FIR Issue And More

New UGC norms silent on penalty for false complaints

New Delhi: A day after Supreme Court stayed UGC's Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026, the education ministry began examining on Friday the removal of the “false complaints” clause that featured in the 2025 draft but was dropped from the final notified rules.Those from the general category have argued that in the absence of a deterrent, false complaints may be used to harass them. Opponents of the regulations pointed out that the new framework includes other backward classes — a category not covered under the 2012 regulations — leaving the general category “without remedies for discrimination faced by them”.While removing OBCs from the purview of the regulations may not be an easy option, sources said the Centre is examining whether safeguards against false complaints need to be restored and the ambit of the anti-discrimination mechanism be expanded to cover EWS.Supreme Court put on hold Thursday the regulations notified on Jan 13, taking serious exception to several provisions and observing that they could fuel societal divisions and have a dangerous impact on the goal of a casteless society.Sections 2 and 3(c) of the regulations, which define beneficiaries as “socially and educationally backward classes” and state that “caste-based discrimination” refers to discrimination against members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and OBCs.Notably, OBCs were not mentioned in Regulation 3(c) of the draft but were added in the notified rules this year.The draft regulations provided for penalties against false complaints. The deleted provision stated that anyone filing a false discrimination complaint could face a fine determined by the equity committee, with repeat or serious violations potentially leading to disciplinary action under institutional rules.A senior govt official said, “This is being examined along with compliance with SC’s directions, including its observation on setting up a panel of experts to study the regulations.”The court flagged concerns around possible “segregation” of students. Section 7 of the regulations, dealing with measures for promotion of equity, states that any selection, segregation or allocation related to hostels, classrooms or mentorship groups must be transparent, fair and non-discriminatory.","Supreme court stayed ugc's promotion of equity in higher education institutions regulations, 2026.

"Why indefinite relaxation on pilot rest norm, SC asks DGCA",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-indefinite-relaxation-on-pilot-rest-norm-sc-asks-dgca/articleshow/127811875.cms,".

New Delhi: Delhi high court on Friday questioned the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) over the “indefinite” relaxation granted to airlines on implementing the new regulations governing pilots’ weekly rest and leave, reports Abhinav Garg.Hearing a PIL that raised the issue, a bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyaya and Justice Tejas Karia sought an explanation as to why the aviation regulator deferred the implementation of the new flight-duty norms soon after introducing them. “What is the rationale for withdrawal of this? And this applies to all airlines,” the bench asked the DGCA counsel. The HC issued notice, giving DGCA two weeks’ time to respond.The new regulations mandate that “no leave shall be substituted by weekly rest”. On Dec 5, 2025, DGCA eased the Flight Duty Time Limitations to allow IndiGo to deploy more pilots on duty in order to reduce disruptions. The move came after IndiGo cancelled hundreds of flights nationwide in the first week of Dec after failing to prepare for the implementation of the new flight-duty norms for pilots.",The delhi high court questioned the directorate general of civil aviation (dgca) over the ‘indefinite’ relaxation granted to airlines on implementing the new regulations governing pilots’ weekly rest and leave.

Docs administering unproven treatments is misconduct: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/docs-administering-unproven-treatments-is-misconduct-sc/articleshow/127811828.cms,".

New Delhi: Observing that doctors administering speculative, unproven or experimental treatments on patients amounts to professional misconduct and negligence, Supreme Court on Friday said stem cell therapy cannot be used for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as it has not been approved for clinical treatment and expressed displeasure that the Centre has not taken suitable action to prevent it.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan also directed putting in place rules, regulations and guidelines to govern stem cell-based clinical trials and research in the country.“A medical practitioner who administers speculative, unproven or experimental treatment even when credible professional bodies have expressly advised against the use of such an intervention, may be held liable on count of professional misconduct. We say so because the administration of such a treatment would fail to satisfy the standard of reasonable care necessitated under the established medical negligence jurisprudence in India,” the bench said.It said every medical practitioner owes to his or her patient a duty to exercise a reasonable degree of care, skill and knowledge expected of a prudent practitioner in the field. “A medical practitioner cannot be said to meet the standard of reasonable care if he administers an intervention that lacks credible scientific evidence of safety and efficacy, or where authoritative medical bodies unequivocally state that such form of treatment is not recommended,” the bench said.The court noted that although stem cells administered for therapeutic use in ASD are characterised as “drugs” under the Drugs Act, 1940, yet the same by itself is not determinative of the fact that it is permissible to be administered as a clinical service. It said if a medical intervention is characterised as unproven, experimental, obsolete or lacking justification by the scientific community, then such an intervention cannot be allowed by doctors.“It is unfortunate that the Union has let the matter worsen without any suitable and timely intervention. Such inaction has led to several parents/guardians seeking an unproven method of treatment for their children suffering from ASD, incurring huge financial cost and in alternative to other approved treatments,” the Supreme Court said.It said, “It cannot be denied that various clinics, in flagrant violation of the statutory mandate, continued to recommend and perform stem cell therapy as a routine clinical treatment for ASD because there was lack of executive action against the same. Therefore, we urge the Union to consolidate and clarify the position of law for enabling better implementation of the same in this regard at the earliest.”","Stem cell therapy cannot be used for autism spectrum disorder (asd) as it has not been approved for clinical treatment.

A chilling call

'We gave them Bullet bike, gold jewellery'





NEW DELHI: A 27-year-old Delhi Police SWAT commando died after being hit by dumbbell at her home in west Delhi.According to news agency PTI, Kajal Chaudhary, who was four months pregnant, was posted with the Special Cell of Delhi Police.She was at her residence in Mohan Garden on January 22 when the alleged assault took place.Her husband, Ankur, a clerk with the Ministry of Defence posted in Delhi Cantonment, was arrested hours later.Kajal succumbed to her injuries on January 27, after battling for life for five days at a hospital in Ghaziabad.Her brother, Nikhil, a constable posted at Parliament Street Police Station, told PTI that he was on the phone when the attack occurred.Also read: ‘Our son would’ve got a car’: Even after giving Bullet bike, dowry harassment continued, says family of slain SWAT commando “He told me to put the call on recording, said it could be used as police evidence; (then) told me he was killing her. And then, I heard her screams,” Nikhil recalled, describing the moments before the call ended abruptly.According to Nikhil, the sequence of events began with a call from Ankur. “He called me and said, ‘Apni behen ko samjha le’ (Make your sister understand). I asked him to calm down and immediately called my sister,” he said.“She normally wouldn’t tell us much about what was happening, but that day she was sharing her ordeal. While we were speaking, he got angry that she was telling me things and snatched the phone from her,” Nikhil said.Also read: 'Ye mar gayi hai hospital aajao’: Kin recall final call from Delhi Police SWAT commando Kajal Chaudhary's husband “Then he said to me, ‘Is call ko recording pe rakh, police evidence me kaam aayega.

Then I heard her screams. The call ended abruptly,” he said.Barely five minutes later, Nikhil said he received another call. “He (Ankur) said, ‘Ye mar gayi hai. Hospital aajao’ (She is dead. Come to the hospital). We rushed there with police personnel. He and his family were already present. When I saw my sister not even an enemy kills someone like this,” he said.The family alleged that Kajal sustained severe head injuries and had multiple wounds across her body. Nikhil said they attempted to admit her to several hospitals but were allegedly told her chances of survival were minimal before she was finally admitted to a Ghaziabad hospital.The family has accused Ankur and his relatives of prolonged torture and dowry harassment, including during Kajal’s pregnancy.The couple has a one-and-a-half-year-old son, who is currently with his maternal grandparents.Recalling an earlier incident, Nikhil said Kajal had been slapped by her husband around five months ago.“I went there and asked her to come with me. Ankur apologised and swore on his child that he wouldn’t repeat it. I told my sister she could return home whenever she wanted and didn’t have to stay there,” he said.He also alleged that Kajal was made to do household chores despite being pregnant. “She would cook, wash clothes and utensils despite being pregnant,” he claimed.“Her son doesn’t know anything about the incident, and we have decided that we will only raise him. We will tell him when he is mature to understand such things,” Nikhil told PTI.Kajal’s father, Rakesh, alleged persistent dowry demands.“We gave them a Bullet bike, gold jewellery and cash at the wedding, but they said our son would have got a car (had he married someone else). Later, my daughter even arranged a car, but they didn't stop harassing her. We couldn't even speak freely to her,” he said.Her mother said the family had spent around Rs 20 lakh on the marriage and taken loans. “He (Ankur) had also taken Rs 5 lakh from her. She (Kajal) suffered a lot. I want justice. He is a monster,” she said.The couple had known each other since their college days in Panipat and married on November 23, 2023.Due to frequent disputes at their native home in Ganaur, Haryana, they shifted to a rented accommodation in Mohan Garden in December 2024, but tensions reportedly continued.Police said financial stress and domestic disputes were among the factors behind the conflict. “The couple had taken some loans and often had arguments over finances and household expenses,” a Delhi Police officer said.“On January 22, Ankur allegedly first banged Kajal’s head against a door frame before attacking her with a dumbbell,” the officer added.A case was registered at Mohan Garden police station based on Nikhil’s complaint. “He was initially booked for attempt to murder. After her death, the charges will be converted to murder,” the officer said.","Kajal chaudhary, 27, died after being hit by dumbbell at her home in west delhi.

Maha Kumbh Stampede Compensation, Sambhal Violence Bail, Magh Mela Footfall And More

NEW DELHI: Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati on Friday asked Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath to stop beef exports from the state and declare the cow as ‘Rajya Mata’. He stated that such steps would prove the chief minister’s commitment as a “Hindu sympathiser”.The remarks come amid an ongoing controversy after the seer was allegedly prevented from taking a holy dip at the Sangam during the Magh Mela in Prayagraj earlier this month.Speaking to reporters in Varanasi, Swami Avimukteshwaranand said that he had staged a sit-in protest for 11 days after the incident but left the Magh Mela ground last Wednesday “with a heavy heart”.“When I sat there for 11 days, no official asked me to take a dip. Now it is too late. I will go to the Magh Mela next year and take a respectful bath,” he said.Challenging the UP government, the seer said that stopping cow slaughter and beef exports should be the first step in demonstrating commitment to Hindu values.“Our credentials were asked for, and we submitted them. Now you have to give proof of being a Hindu sympathiser. The first step of being a Hindu is love for cows. Declare the cow as ‘Rashtra Mata’ and stop the export of cow meat from Uttar Pradesh,” he said.The controversy dates back to January 18, when Swami Avimukteshwaranand was travelling in a palanquin to the Sangam on the occasion of Mauni Amavasya.A dispute broke out after police and administrative officials asked him to dismount and proceed on foot, citing heavy crowds. The Mela administration later alleged that his supporters broke a barricade on a pontoon bridge, creating difficulties in crowd management.Following the incident, the seer began a sit-in protest outside the Shankaracharya camp, demanding an apology and a dignified escort for the ritual bath. He later announced that he would not take a dip until the administration apologised for misbehaviour towards him and his followers.Amid the row, the Mela administration issued a notice seeking an explanation on his use of the title of Shankaracharya of Jyotish Peeth, citing a civil appeal pending before the Supreme Court. The seer hit back, questioning how camps of two Shankaracharyas from Puri were allowed at the same mela.The issue has since triggered political and administrative reactions. Prashant Kumar Singh, a deputy commissioner in the Uttar Pradesh GST department posted in Ayodhya, resigned from service citing moral reasons and said that he was hurt by baseless allegations against the chief minister and the prime minister by the seer.Bareilly city magistrate Alankar Agnihotri also resigned, citing concerns over the alleged insult to Swami Avimukteshwaranand and broader social issues.The Congress has announced an awareness campaign against the insult of the Shankaracharya.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday ruled that the right to menstrual hygiene is an integral part of the right to life and the right to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution.The top court has issued a series of binding directions to states, Union Territories and schools to ensure dignity, health and equality for girls and women.The order was given by the bench of Justices JB Pardiwala and R Mahadevan. Pronouncing its judgment on a plea seeking free sanitary pads and adequate sanitation facilities for schoolgirls, the apex court directed all states and Union Territories to provide biodegradable sanitary napkins free of cost to girl students in all schools.“Before parting with the issue, we want to say that this pronouncement is not just for stakeholders of the legal system. It is also meant for classrooms where girls hesitate to ask for help. It is for teachers who want to help but are not able to due to the lack of resources. Progress is measured by how we protect the vulnerable”, Justice Pardiwala observed before parting with the judgment.It also ordered authorities to ensure separate toilets for female and male students, along with disability-friendly toilets, in every school.The apex body made it clear that the compliance would be mandatory for both government and private institutions. It warned that private schools could face derecognition if they fail to provide separate toilets for girls and boys or do not ensure access to free sanitary pads for students.The bench said that access to menstrual hygiene is not a matter of charity or policy discretion, but a constitutional entitlement flowing from the right to live with dignity and bodily autonomy.The top court further directed that it will hold government accountable if they fail to provide toilets and free sanitary pads to girls.It observed that lack of basic facilities and stigma around menstruation directly affects girls’ health, education and privacy.The judgment follows proceedings initiated in November last year, when the court took cognisance of a disturbing incident at Maharshi Dayanand University in Haryana, where three women sanitation workers were allegedly forced to send photographs of their sanitary pads to prove they were menstruating. The incident had triggered nationwide outrage over “period-shaming”.At that stage, a bench of Justices BV Nagarathna and R Mahadevan had expressed concern over such practices in educational institutions and workplaces, observing that they reflected a deeply troubling mindset.The court had issued notice to the Centre on a petition filed by the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), which highlighted multiple instances of women and girls being subjected to invasive and degrading checks.In its petition, the SCBA argued that such practices were “in gross violation of their right to life, dignity, privacy and bodily integrity under Article 21”.It also stressed that women workers, particularly in the unorganised sector, are entitled to decent working conditions that respect biological differences and protect them from humiliating treatment during menstruation.During the earlier hearing, the court had observed that if a woman was unable to perform heavy work due to menstruation-related pain, alternative arrangements should be made instead of subjecting her to degrading scrutiny.“If someone is saying that because of this reason heavy work could not be done, it could have been accepted and some other persons could have been deployed,” the bench had said, expressing hope that meaningful guidelines would emerge from the case.The Haryana government had informed the court that an inquiry had been initiated into the university incident and that action had been taken against two persons responsible.","The top court has issued a series of binding directions to states, union territories and schools.

After Ajit Pawar, Maharashtra Faces Power Vacuum As NCP And Alliances Enter Uncharted Territory

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said on Friday that it is up to the NCP to choose its next leader following the untimely demise of party chief and Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar.The BJP leader added that both his party and the state government would support whatever decision the NCP makes.“The decision will be taken by the NCP. We will stand by whatever decision the NCP takes...We are standing by the family of Ajit Pawar and the NCP,,” he told reporters in Mumbai.Fadnavis added that he would also review the procedures required to finalise the state budget, which Pawar—who also held the crucial portfolio—was due to present next month.“He had already done significant work on the state budget. Starting tomorrow, I will personally oversee the remaining processes, and we will decide on the next steps,” the chief minister stated.His remarks came amid reports that the NCP would hold a legislative party meeting on Saturday to elect Rajya Sabha MP Sunetra Pawar, Ajit Pawar’s wife, to succeed the Maratha heavyweight as both the legislative party leader and as the deputy chief minister of Maharashtra and, later, possibly as NCP president.However, Fadnavis declined to comment on Sunetra Pawar being sworn in as the deputy CM.She made her electoral debut in last year’s Lok Sabha election, where she was defeated by her sister-in-law and Ajit Pawar’s cousin, Supriya Sule, in the family’s Baramati stronghold.Ajit Pawar, 66, who broke away from his uncle, veteran politician Sharad Pawar, in 2023 to join the BJP and Shiv Sena-led Mahayuti alliance, was the state’s longest-serving deputy chief minister, having held the post for six terms.He died on Wednesday morning when the private aircraft he was travelling in from Mumbai crashed during an emergency landing in Baramati, where he was scheduled to address a rally.

Sunetra seen as ideal choice as she could provide a smooth transition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sunetra-seen-as-ideal-choice-as-she-could-provide-a-smooth-transition/articleshow/127810162.cms,".

Sunetra Pawar To Be Named NCP Leader, Dy CM Oath Likely Tomorrow: Chhagan Bhujbal

Ajit Pawar's wife and Rajya Sabha MP, Sunetra Pawar, is set to take over the reins of the party after his passing as she ticks the boxes of seniority, parity (with the rest of the Pawars), continuity and stability that the party wants bold and underlined.While the names of Ajit's sons Jay and Parth are also doing the rounds, what weighs things far more in Sunetra's favour is the feeling that there needs to be continuity, which the 62-year-old widow of the Maratha strongman will provide more than anyone else as she is the spouse, plus the fact that seniority considerations have to be kept in mind to some extent while picking a successor.Ajit had a team of senior politicians around him in his NCP. Praful Patel, Dilip Walse Patil, Chhagan Bhujbal, Hasan Mushrif, Sunil Tatkare, Dhananjay Munde are all politicians with experience in politics, legislature and administration. The party would accept the sons without hesitation as Parth and Jay are carriers of Ajit's name and legacy. But Sunetra's name would not require a negotiation with even the most experienced of the lot.The transition would be smooth and unquestioned, and acceptance of responsibilities would be genuine under her leadership among both seniors and juniors in NCP. Crucially, it is expected to stymie attempts to wean away a section of the outfit or some of its 40-odd MLAs either owing to injured egos or groupism or simply the promise of greater benefits and stability in other political camps.Sunetra's loss to Supriya Sule in 2024 Lok Sabha elections had rankled with Ajit, and placing her in the top position now would be one way of making amends, of assuaging sentiments of those in NCP who have a sense of hurt about that defeat, and of also making a political statement in the process.Sunetra's parity with the other seniors in the Pawar household would be another key factor. She would be able to speak to the leadership of the other faction of NCP as an equal and make acceptable decisions, including those about a merger. If, say, she decides to assert the identity and independence of the Ajit-led NCP, all forces within the party would instantly rally around her.Jay and Parth would also be able to negotiate or talk to the other faction, but Sunetra at the helm would be enough to scotch the rank and file's fears of a hasty decision taken by an impressionable person or one weighed down by thoughts of deference to elders, which is natural in a household as famously close-knit as those of the Pawars.Sunetra is the sister of former state minister and education baron Padamsinh Patil. Apart from her experience in Rajya Sabha, she has seen political activity up close all her life. She has also been engaged in social work for nearly two decades. She founded Environmental Forum of India in 2010, which works on promoting adoption of eco-friendly practices by villages and creation of eco-conscious communities.She's been a trustee of educational institution, Vidya Pratisthan in Baramati, on whose grounds Ajit's mortal remains were kept for people to pay their respects and where his last rites were carried out. The party believes that this experience in the social sector also makes her the ideal pick to lead it.","Ajit pawar's wife and rajya sabha mp, sunetra pawar, is set to take over the reins of the party after his passing.

NCP factions eyeing February merger?

Will Ajit Pawar’s death speed up reunification?



Who will fill the vacuum?



Maharashtra ’s power dynamics



NEW DELHI: The sudden death of Maharashtra deputy chief minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Ajit Pawar in a plane crash has triggered fresh churn in the state’s politics, reopening talks of a reunification of the two NCP factions led by the Pawars.The rumoured merger of the two NCP factions led by Ajit Pawar and his uncle Sharad Pawar is ""very much on course"", with talks having reached an ""advanced stage"" even before the deputy chief minister’s death in Wednesday’s plane crash, sources aware of the talks told news agency PTI.""The process of bringing the family and the party back together was already in motion. Ajit dada himself had held several rounds of discussions with senior leaders to bridge the gap,"" the sources said.The tragedy, they say, may now accelerate the process rather than stall it.Negotiators from both the ruling NCP and the Sharad Pawar-led NCP (SP) confirmed that discussions were well underway, with a tentative announcement earlier planned for February 8, shortly after the Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti elections, the agency said.The two factions had already ""tested the waters"" by jointly contesting the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad civic polls under the NCP’s clock symbol, which was a clear sign of a thaw after the dramatic 2023 split.Sources said Ajit Pawar had meticulously planned the reunification of the two NCP factions and viewed the merger as part of a long-term strategy, keeping the 2029 elections and the party’s future relevance in mind. He was confident the reunion would take place with the consent of his uncle, Sharad Pawar.Reunification was also Ajit Pawar’s last wish, according to Kiran Gujar, a member of Vidya Pratishthan and a close associate of the Pawar family for over four decades.Speaking to reporters after the immersion of Ajit Pawar’s ashes, Gujar said, ""Today, the ashes of Ajit Pawar were immersed at Sangam here. It was ‘Dada’s’ last wish that this (merger of two factions of NCP) should happen. All should be united. Talks about this were happening throughout the family. In my last phone call with him, he had asked me for some election-related papers.""""He was one hundred per cent keen on merging both the factions. He had told me five days ago that the entire process was complete and the merger was imminent in the next few days,"" Gujar told PTI.Asked whether Ajit Pawar had discussed the issue with Sharad Pawar, Gujar said that ""positive talks were underway with Pawar saheb, Supriya Tai (Supriya Sule) and other leaders"", and there were indications that the senior Pawar would endorse the move.""Many positive things were on the cards, but this tragedy struck and took Ajit 'Dada' away from us. Now, after his death, it has become even more imperative that both factions come together and work for the betterment of Baramati and the state,"" he said.Just days before the fatal plane crash, Ajit Pawar had also met NCP (SP) leader Jayant Patil to finalise organisational unity and power-sharing arrangements. Even as merger talks gathered momentum, a section of party workers in the NCP has begun debating Ajit Pawar’s successor.Ajit Pawar himself had earlier told TOI that reuniting the party was his immediate political goal, with the blessings of Sharad Pawar.The moment carries a stark irony. Ajit Pawar was the architect of the 2023 split that fractured the NCP and aligned a majority of its legislators with the BJP–Shiv Sena-led Mahayuti government, leaving Sharad Pawar’s faction in opposition.Yet, despite the split, Ajit Pawar retained the party’s official identity, with the Election Commission recognising his group as the ""real"" NCP and awarding it the ""watch"" symbol.Ajit Pawar’s death has left the ruling NCP without a clear leader, triggering uncertainty over both leadership and key cabinet portfolios, including finance and excise, which he handled. With senior leader Chhagan Bhujbal unwell, the leadership question has become more urgent.While the Sharad Pawar-led NCP (SP) believes the veteran leader will naturally return to a ""central role"" in guiding a unified party, the ruling NCP is keen to preserve the Pawar family’s political legacy.The NCP will hold a meeting of its legislature party on January 31 to formally name Sunetra Pawar, wife of the late deputy chief minister, as its leader, Bhujbal said on Friday.Speaking to reporters at the NCP office, Bhujbal said chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has conveyed that he has no objection to Sunetra Pawar taking oath as deputy chief minister as early as Saturday, provided the legislature party takes a formal decision.Ajit Pawar’s NCP currently holds 40 MLAs, while the Sharad Pawar faction has 10.A merged party would command over 50 MLAs, potentially altering equations within the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance and the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA).However, even if a unified NCP were to exit the ruling alliance, the Devendra Fadnavis government would remain secure, with the Mahayuti holding 235 MLAs in the 288-member Assembly.Political analysts say the bigger impact could be in western Maharashtra, the NCP’s traditional ""sugar belt"" — where the BJP has made recent inroads.For now, the February 7 local body polls will act as a ""coordinated tribute"" to the late leader, with both NCP factions contesting together under the clock symbol, seen as a prelude to a possible reunification after the results are declared on February 9.","The rumoured merger of the two ncp factions led by ajit pawar and his uncle sharad pawar is ""very much on course"", sources say.

Govt likely to consider allowing export of wheat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-likely-to-consider-allowing-export-of-wheat/articleshow/127809305.cms,".

New Delhi: The govt may consider allowing export of wheat as the stock of the foodgrain with Food Corporation of India is now almost double of the required buffer and the prospect of a bumper harvest this year.As per govt data, the overall wheat sown area this year is at a record 33.4 million hectare, 3% higher than last year. There is a prospect of another bumper crop this year, following a record 118 million tonne (MT) of wheat production in 2024-25.TOI has learnt that deliberations over the issue of allowing wheat export at an inter-ministerial committee are underway and a decision would be taken soon. The govt had imposed a ban on wheat export in May 2022 following less production.At present, FCI holds wheat stock of 25.9 MT against the required buffer of 13.8 MT for Jan 1. “So, there is no issue so far as meeting the domestic demand is concerned. There is enough wheat available in the domestic market. It won’t be an issue, if we allow export of some quantity of the foodgrain,” said a govt official.Earlier this month, the govt eased the ban on wheat product exports by permitting limited, regulated shipments of wheat flour and related processed products. The govt has capped such exports at five lakh tonnes.","The overall wheat sown area this year is at a record 33.4 million hectare, 3% higher than last year.

New Delhi: NHAI has refunded toll charges in 17.7 lakh cases between Jan and Dec 2025 for incorrect deductions and in nearly 35% of these cases, the vehicles were not at the toll plaza when the user fee was debited from FASTag wallet.Considering that such transactions happen due to manual entry of vehicle details by toll operators because of some issue, the road transport ministry is mulling doing away with this option completely.In a written reply, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari informed the Lok Sabha Thursday that National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI), which provides the Central Clearing House (CCH) services of electronic toll collection , ""has reported 17.6 lakh transactions where refunds were made due to incorrect user fee (toll) deductions from Jan-2025 to Dec-2025 out of a total of 464 crore FASTag transactions"".This is barely 0.03% of all FASTag transactions.An official said, ""Though the number of faulty transactions is miniscule, this shouldn't happen.

Failure to provide pads creates gender-specific barrier, says SC

New Delhi: Bringing the right of access to menstrual hygiene and gender-segregated toilets within the ambit of fundamental rights, Supreme Court directed states and Union territories on Friday to provide free sanitary napkins to adolescent girls in all govt and private schools and also construct separate toilets for them on campus.In a judgment jointly authored by Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan, the bench fixed a timeline of three months for the govts to enforce its direction. In order to ensure that its directions did not remain only on paper, it decided to monitor its implementation and posted the case for hearing after three months to examine compliance. ""We wish to communicate to every girl child, who might have become a victim of absenteeism because her body was perceived as a burden, that the fault is not hers. These words must travel beyond the courtroom, law review reports, and reach the everyday conscience of society at large,"" the bench said.The court said that inaccessibility of menstrual hygiene management measures undermines the dignity of a girl child and menstruation acts as a barrier to the right to access education as many researches pointed out to absenteeism of girl students because of it.The court said the absence of the measures entrenches gendered disadvantage by converting a biological reality into a structural exclusion which must be removed.“Dignity finds expression in conditions that enable individuals to live without humiliation, exclusion, or avoidable suffering. The right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution includes the right to menstrual health. Access to safe, effective, and affordable menstrual hygiene management measures helps a girl child attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. The right to healthy reproductive life embraces the right to access education and information about sexual health,” it said.Observing that quality of education goes beyond textbooks, teachers, or classrooms, and it includes all the conditions that enable effective learning and continuity of schooling, the bench said the failure to provide sanitary napkins creates a gender-specific barrier that impedes attendance, and continuity in education, thereby defeating the substantive guarantee of free and compulsory education.It directed measures be taken to spread awareness about it to ensure that menstruation should not be a topic that is only shared in whispers. It ordered NCERT and the State Council of Educational Research and Training to incorporate gender responsive curricula, more particularly on menstruation, puberty, and other related health concerns, with a view to break stigma and taboo associated with menstrual health and hygiene.“It is crucial that boys are educated about the biological reality of menstruation. A male student, unsensitised towards the issue, may harass a menstruating girl child which may discourage her from attending school… Time is overripe that we recognise menstrual health as a shared responsibility rather than a woman’s issue. Awareness must not be limited to girls, but extends to boys, parents, and teachers. When menstruation is discussed openly in schools, it ceases to be a source of shame. It is recognised as what it is, a biological fact. Needless to say, it must be seen as a collective effort rather than a constitutional pull,” the bench said.Regarding lack of gender-segregated toilets in schools despite almost two decades after the Right to Education law was passed, the bench said, “What emerges is a stark constitutional failure, inasmuch as, although the statute mandates barrier-free access to the school building and separate toilets for boys and girls, yet, even after almost 17 years of enactment of the legislation, many schools continue to lack basic necessities for students. The norms and standards laid down in the Schedule are not merely procedural in nature but are integral to the effective realisation of Section 3 of the RTE Act, and more particularly, the right to education under Article 21A.”","Supreme court directs states and union territories to provide free sanitary napkins to adolescent girls in all govt and private schools.

BMC Polls 2026: Inside Mumbai’s Civic Giant Whose Budget Is Bigger Than Many Indian States

NEW DELHI: Delay in municipal elections in cities like Mumbai and Bengaluru has deprived their civic bodies from getting grants earmarked as per the 15th Finance Commission. The tenure of the current commission ends on Saturday. All grants under the commission were linked to the timely election for municipal entities.Considering that the civic election in Mumbai was held after a gap of seven years, the BMC and the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) did not get the entire Rs 4,031 crore allocated under the Finance Commission’s framework. Similarly, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike did not get Rs 2,304 crore as the municipal election was delayed by five years.“This provision of linking grant to existing elected local govt was a significant move by the 15th Finance Commission. But it seems political reasons override the expected financial grant that a city would get. Municipal elections have been subject to political considerations across all political regimes,” said an expert in urban governance.A recent study by Janaagraha, a Bengaluru-based not-for-profit institution, found that as many as 61% of urban local bodies across 17 states experienced postponements of municipal elections in recent years.",Delay in municipal elections in cities like mumbai and bengaluru has deprived their civic bodies from getting grants earmarked as per the 15th finance commission.

KURUKSHETRA:

Former chief minister and leader of the opposition in Haryana Vidhan Sabha Bhupinder Singh Hooda has said the BJP is committing a great betrayal against the poor people of Haryana. This government took the votes of the poor by issuing ration cards during the elections, and now their ration cards are being arbitrarily canceled.Hooda was in Kurukshetra to offer condolences to the families of former minister Harmohinder Singh Chatha's wife and MLA Ramkaran Kala's elder brother, who recently passed away.Speaking to reporters later, Hooda said the BJP government is committing a great injustice against the poor in the name of Family IDs. “Ration cards of 70,000 families have been canceled in the last six months alone due to minor errors in names, ages, and other details,” he said.“This is not just a statistic, but a painful story of snatching food from the plates of thousands of poor families. Earlier, Haryana topped the entire country by canceling approximately 14 lakh ration cards,” he added.“Ration cards are being canceled, pensions are being stopped due to minor errors in Family IDs, and people are forced to make rounds of district Saral Kendras (government service centers) for months.Most concerning is that even after correcting the errors, the ration and pensions of many families are not being restored. According to reports, the pensions of more than 500,000 people have been stopped so far,” he pointed out.Hooda said that the BJP added 1 crore additional people to the BPL (Below Poverty Line) category to garner votes in the 2024 elections, and immediately after securing votes, they started arbitrarily canceling ration cards.“In response to a question asked during the winter session of Parliament, the central government stated that 4,141,385 ration cards were canceled across the country, with the Haryana government topping the list with 1,343,474 cancellations,” the former Chief Minister said.Hooda questioned why so many ration cards were issued before the elections and why they are being canceled now? “Why is the government not answering this question,” he asked.",Bhupinder singh hooda said the bjp government is committing a great injustice against the poor in the name of family ids.

NEW DELHI: Shaheen Malik does not call it a victory. When her petition came up before the Supreme Court on Tuesday, the Bench made observations that could reshape how acid attack cases are treated—flagging the need for “extraordinary punitive measures”, questioning why the assets of convicted attackers cannot be seized and auctioned to compensate victims, and stating that a reformative approach has “no place” for attackers.While stopping short of issuing binding directions, the court assured Malik legal assistance of her choice, urged high courts to fast-track trials, and sought detailed data from states on acid attack cases. But for Malik, there is a long way to go. “This is not closure or a win. For survivors, it is only a beginning,” she toldon Friday.In 2009, acid was thrown on Malik’s face outside her workplace in Panipat. Since then, her life has unfolded inside hospital wards, police stations and courtrooms. She accused her employer’s wife and two students, one a juvenile, of carrying out the attack.Earlier data submitted by 15 HCs showed UP with the highest number of pending acid attack cases (198), followed by West Bengal (160), Gujarat (114), Bihar (68) and Maharashtra (58).For Malik, the numbers only echo what her body has carried for years.“For one second, I thought it was a prank,” she recalled. “Then the burning started.”Her parents and brothers rushed to bring her back to Delhi, hoping she would be admitted immediately, but they were turned away. “Hospitals initially refused to admit me unless we deposited lakhs of rupees, saying it was a criminal case,” she told the court. Even after an FIR was registered, she said, nothing moved. “Years passed… The case didn’t move. ”What followed was not only physical devastation, but systemic abandonment. Survival itself came at a cost that never stopped mounting.The corrosive liquid caused third-degree burns and permanent disfigurement, melting skin and facial tissue across nearly 90% of her face and parts of her body. Malik permanently lost vision in one eye. After more than two dozen reconstructive surgeries, her remaining eye still requires lifelong treatment and specialised cylindrical lenses.In 2012, after writing to then Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, she received Rs 3 lakh towards medical expenses. Malik said, “Justice was never about the money. But the cost of surviving is crushing.”Years blurred into each other—endless travel, hospital visits followed by court dates, and a support system that slowly shrank. “I lost friends, connections… everything.”Then came 2025. After more than 15 years of litigation, a Delhi court acquitted the three accused, citing lack of substantial evidence and serious gaps in the investigation. “I was disfigured, visually impaired, mentally shattered—and the people responsible walked free.” That moment became the trigger for her PIL in the SC. “I woke up and decided, this needs a fight,” Malik said.“I could give up—or continue fighting for every woman facing injustice.” She chose the latter not just for herself but to flag what she calls a ""structural failure"".Malik spoke of time slipping away. Pleading for an expedited hearing, she told the court the violence does not end with the crime. It stretches across years of trauma, isolation, treatment, hearings and waiting. “I told the SC that the pain I carry, no one else should have to carry for this long. I have given this case sixteen years of my life. I cannot give another sixteen,” she said.If Malik has one demand, it is not sympathy but sensitisation with consequences. Her petition sought police training, time-bound investigations, fast-track courts, judicial sensitivity and stricter punishment. “Acid violence comes from patriarchy, entitlement. When there is no fear, crimes continue.”Like hundreds of hearings she has attended before, that Tuesday began with cautious hope. She reached early, even though her case was listed for the afternoon. When the order finally came, she wiped away a tear.Malik believes the court’s suggestion to auction assets of convicted attackers is crucial. She said, “Medical care for acid survivors is primary for their survival. No one should live wondering if better treatment could have saved their sight, face, or future.”Acid violence, she said, imposes lifelong financial, psychological and social costs. “If the crime is created by society, then society must step in—not through charity, but accountability.”The violence stripped her of an ordinary future, with marriage out of the picture long ago. She lives alone, often wishing she had a companion. “No one wants to accept you with this face… this disability. I have to live like this for the rest of my life.”In 2021, Malik founded Brave Souls Foundation in Delhi, supporting over 300 acid attack survivors with medical aid, legal assistance, trauma counselling and rehabilitation. But stigma remains. “People don’t want to rent us houses, don’t want to give us jobs. They say our faces bring bad luck. The culprits, meanwhile, blend back into normal life.”Still, Malik says she has purpose. “My work is my life’s goal. If I can ease someone else’s struggle, it’s enough.” She hopes to be remembered not as a victim, but as proof that fighting yields something.“This isn’t personal anymore,” she said.","In 2009, acid was thrown on shaheen malik’s face outside her workplace in panipat.
