SC to govt: Consider law to curb ridiculing of disabled,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-to-govt-consider-law-to-curb-ridiculing-of-disabled/articleshow/125626753.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday suggested enacting a law on the line of the stringent SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act to deter ridiculing of differently abled people, but the Union govt flagged the potential adverse impact of such legislation on creative artists depicting individuals with disability in movies and theatres.Hearing a petition by NGO Cure SMA Foundation that objected to five stand-up comedians ridiculing the exorbitant cost of treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and persons with disability in different shows, a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, “Why don’t you (Union govt) bring a stringent legislation like SC/ST Act? It criminalises ridiculing the depressed, deprived and discriminated class of citizens. A similar law to protect persons with disability could be considered for enactment.”Mehta, sharing the court’s concern, said he would discuss it with the authorities but flagged the point that such a legislation might create a problem for artists who play characters, for example dumb and blind, in movies, theatres and dramas. They may evoke humour but also seek to depict in a larger sense the difficulties they face in society, he said.Appearing for the NGO, senior advocate Aparajita Singh said the organisation arranges for treatment of SMA patients mainly through crowd funding, which was affected because of a stand-up comedian’s disparaging remarks on cost of treatment. She said that a decision to allow corporate entities to donate CSR funds for treatment of SMA patients would go a long way in mitigating their suffering.When the court said the govt should create a corpus for treatment of SMA patients, Mehta said the Centre already has a scheme through which treatments up to Rs 50 lakh are borne by the exchequer. However, in one case, which was before SC, the treatment cost Rs 16 crore, a huge sum which the govt felt could be utilised to treat many more patients. “There is a platform for corporate CSR donations,” he said.Whan Samay Raina’s counsel said the stand-up comedian, who was hauled up by the court for his disparaging remarks against SMA patients along with others of his tribe who had ridiculed disability, had contributed Rs 2.5 lakh to SMA, Singh said the NGO does not need his money. She said if he could atone for his mistake by hosting achievers with SMA, it would send a positive message in society and make the public aware of the degenerative disease.Singh gave the names of 11 outstanding achievers — IITians, computer professionals working with Google and Microsoft, acclaimed author, academicians, filmmaker, doctors and sportsman — who suffer from SMA, and suggested these persons are hosted on comedians’ digital shows to spread the message in society.The bench agreed and asked the comedians to host two shows every month featuring the achievers with SMA and disability and contribute the earnings towards treatment of differently abled and SMA patients. “We are putting a social burden on you instead of punishing you,” CJI Kant and Justice Bagchi said.",Supreme court suggested enacting a law on the line of the stringent sc and st (prevention of atrocities) act to deter ridiculing of differently abled people.

CISF okays 4-year tenure for its personnel on Parliament duty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cisf-okays-4-year-tenure-for-its-personnel-on-parliament-duty/articleshow/125626738.cms,"CISF (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The Central Industrial Security Force ( CISF ), which now fully secures the Parliament House complex (PHC), has okayed an extended four-year tenure for its personnel on Parliament security duty, which may be further stretched by a year. The move is aimed at striking the right balance between operational continuity, so as to enhance familiarity of personnel with members of Parliament, and the former’s optimum rotation for steady infusion of new blood.As per CISF’s general posting norms, its personnel are allowed a maximum three-year tenure in a given place of posting, though this may be extended. The revised posting policy specific to PHC security duties will ensure that a fixed proportion of the sanctioned strength is changed every year. The extended tenure will also strengthen familiarity of personnel with MPs and movement patterns within PHC, which is critical for ensuring accurate identification, secure access protocols and layered threat detection and response.The updated CISF guidelines specific to PHC security duties lay down tighter eligibility norms for gazetted officers and non-gazetted officers, with mandatory multi-stage screening. Personnel detailed for PHC duties must possess a clean service record, be in top shape-1 medical category, have no disciplinary or vigilance concerns and should have completed at least 2 specialised courses conducted by the NSG and Army.",Cisf has okayed an extended four-year tenure for its personnel on parliament security duty.

SC: Need to pre-screen social media content,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-need-to-pre-screen-social-media-content/articleshow/125626640.cms,"‘Right to free speech must be given the widest width.

SC: Issue is social media content that goes viral before pull-down

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday told the information and broadcasting ministry to prepare a draft mechanism for screening of user-generated content (UGC) prior to its uploading on social media, realising its vast potential to cause social upheaval before being taken down.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said, “Right to freedom of speech is very important but a regulated right. It is not absolute as the First Amendment Rights in the US. Self-regulatory codes may not work in case of UGC. If anti-national content is uploaded on social media, by the time the govt notices it and orders its takedown, a day or two may pass, during which period it would go viral and cause damage to, or unrest in, society. ”The bench said, “We will not approve of a mechanism that will gag expression of views or freedom of speech. We are on a reasonable preventive mechanism, not to throttle but sieve content on social media prior to uploading. AI provides enormous potential to curate content. Some content may be academic yet... scurrilous. Today there is a statutory vacuum in this regard which needs to be filled.”Advocate Prashant Bhushan protested use of the word “anti-national” and said it is subjectively and selectively defined by authorities.The SC bench said, “Forget the definition of anti-national. If someone posts a video claiming parts of India with a neighbouring country, will it not be termed anti-national?”Bhushan differed. He asked, “If I question the accession of Sikkim to India, it is a mere viewpoint and cannot be termed anti-national.If I discuss China claiming parts of India’s territory, would it be anti-national?” Solicitor general Tushar Mehta protested loudly & said Bhushan should not instigate secession in a judicial proceeding related to curbing uploading of obscene, perverse & anti-national content on social media.CJI Kant said, “There was a case before us during Operation Sindoor. A person uploaded a video claiming he was with Pakistan and praised another country for helping Pakistan. When the matter came before the court, he simply said he had deleted the post within an hour of posting it. But in this age, the moment such content gets posted on social media, it immediately goes viral and there is no mechanism to prevent uploading of such content. ”“Right to free speech must be given the widest width. But in the case of content on social media, prosecution is a post-occurrence proceeding. There should be preventive mechanisms to stop spreading misinformation and damage to society,” the bench said.When two associations of broadcasters, OTTs and digital channels said they have self-regulatory codes and that there is no need for pre-censorship of content, the bench asked, “If the self-regulatory code is working, why is such content getting posted on social media?”“A portal under self-regulation cannot decide whether content is damaging to society, obscene or outrageous. We can’t also give that regulatory power to the govt, but to an autonomous body. Speaking against the govt is not anti-national activity. That is a precious democratic right. But the problem is with certain content on social media which goes viral prior to these being taken down,” the bench said.The court asked the I&B ministry to frame guidelines in four weeks and then publicise them to seek suggestions and objections from the public. The bench said the court would examine the issue after the govt prepares the draft mechanism, after considering the suggestions and objections of experts and public, to scrutinise social media content prior to their uploading.Attorney general R Venkaratamani and Mehta told the court that the ministry would carry out the exercise and take public opinion on it within four weeks. The bench said that the govt should take help of domain experts, jurists and media personnel in drafting the proposed mechanism.","‘right to free speech must be given the widest width.

NEW DELHI: It's common that when a couple who have two children start living separately due to any matrimonial dispute, the children also get separated, with one living with the mother and the other with the father. But the Supreme Court on Thursday raised a question on why siblings should suffer living separately because of problems between their parents and said they should be able to live and grow together.While hearing a matrimonial dispute of a couple, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan expressed its sadness when informed that husband and wife have been living separately for the last few years and their minor children are also living separately - boy with the father and girl with the mother.""We are sad to note that the minor siblings are living separately. This separation is very painful. Siblings have to grow together. They have not committed any wrong. Why should they suffer? Even if the parties (husband and wife) decided to part ways, we think siblings should live and grow together,"" the bench said.As the lawyers appearing for the warring couple told the court that mediation was on between them before the SC mediation centre, the court deferred the hearing till the outcome of the mediation.But the court again underscored that if the mediation fails and they decide to separate, even then arrangements should be made to ensure the siblings live together with either of the parents.""We are sad to note that the minor son is with the husband, whereas the minor daughter is with the mother. This separation of the siblings is something very painful. The siblings have to grow up together. They have not committed any fault. We want the parties to continue with the mediation and, as far as possible, try to arrive at some settlement. Even if the parties decide to part honourably and peacefully, we believe that the siblings should grow up together. Either the husband will bring up the children, or the mother will bring up the children,"" the court said in its order.",Supreme court on thursday raised a question on why siblings should suffer living separately.

Former US Rep and economist Dr Dave Brat trained the guns at India over the H-1B visa program and said that while the national cap for H-1B is 85,000, one Indian district got 220,000 H-1B visas which is 2.5 times the limit. ""When you hear H-1B, think of your family, because these fraudulent visas just stole their future,"" Dr Brat said, appearing on Steve Bannon's podcast, adding that China contributes only 12% to the H-1B program.In 2024, India's Chennai consulate reportedly processed roughly 220,000 H-1B visas and 140,000 H-4 dependent visas. The H-1B visa program allows US companies to hire foreign skill.US diplomat Mahvash Siddiqui , an Indian-origin US Foreign Service Officer, called out the industrialized fraud in the H-1B visa program as she recounted her experience at the Chennai consulate in India 20 years ago. Siddiqui revealed a shocking figure and claimed that 80-90% of the H-1B visas from India are fake -- either they have fake degrees or some other forged documents or they are not highly skilled as to be deserving an H-1B visa.Siddiqui said she was posted to the Chennai consulate from 2005 to 2007 when she adjudicated at least 51,000 H-1B visas. The Chennai consulate processed applications from four regions: Hyderabad, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, she said, adding that Hyderabad was the most concerning as Hyderabad's Ameerpet had shops not only consulting candidates on visa but providing them with forged documents -- be it an educational certificate or a marriage certificate.Siddiqui said she and the team she was working with quickly learned the fraud pattern and flagged it to the administration but there was a lot of political pressure. And their anti-fraud drive was called a 'rogue operation'. Siddiqui claimed many politicians were involved in running the operation and there was pressure on them not to pursue their investigation.","Us diplomat mahvash siddiqui called out the industrialized fraud in the h-1b visa program.

Women in polygamous marriages: Study reveals what Muslim women experience when husbands bring in more wives

NEW DELHI: The Assam Assembly on Tuesday passed “The Assam Prohibition of Polygamy Bill, 2025,” aiming to ban polygamous marriages across the state and impose strict penalties on those who enter into or conceal a second marriage while the first is still valid.The law, introduced by Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on the first day of the winter session, will apply statewide except in Sixth Schedule areas and to members of Scheduled Tribes as defined under the Constitution.Speaking before the state assembly approved the bill, Sarma said the legislation, which bans polygamous marriages across most of Assam, is not against Islam. He said the legislation was “irrespective of religion and not against Islam as being perceived by a section”, reported PTI.""Islam can't promote polygamy. If this bill passes, then you will get a chance to be a true Muslim. This bill is not against Islam. The true Islamic people will welcome this Act. Countries like Turkey have also banned Polygamy; there is an arbitration council in Pakistan..."" Sarma said, as cited by ANI.Sarma has also pledged to implement the Uniform Civil Code in Assam if he is re-elected in next year’s assembly polls.""If I return to the assembly as the Chief Minister, I will bring the UCC in the first session of the assembly. I give you my commitment that I will bring the UCC to Assam,"" Sarma added.The bill was introduced amid the absence of opposition MLAs from Congress, CPI(M), and Raijor Dal, who staged a walkout following a discussion on the death of singer Zubeen Garg.The bill defines polygamy as marrying another person while either party already has a valid, existing marriage or a living spouse from whom they are not legally divorced or whose marriage has not been annulled.It states that anyone entering into a polygamous marriage will face up to seven years in prison and a fine, as specified in law.""No person shall marry, if, he has a living spouse or he is not legally separated from the other spouse following due procedure of law, after marriage, or he is a party to a marriage which is not yet dissolved or annulled by a decree of divorce and either has right to appeal or the specified time for appeal has not been expired or is in appeal, or the appeal has been presented but has not yet been dismissed,"" the bill mentions, as cited by ANI.""Whoever abets any offences punishable under this Act or attempts to commit any such offence shall be punishable with the punishment as provided under the Act for the offence of polygamy. Whoever, during the lifetime of his or her spouse or during subsistence of a valid marriage or without having been lawfully divorced from the spouse, or without having been declared the marriage null and void or dissolved, contracts a marriage contravening any of the provisions contained in the Act under Section 4 shall be guilty of an offence punishable with imprisonment upto 7 years and a fine,"" the bill adds.","Assam assembly passes 'prohibition of polygamy bill, 2025' chief minister himanta biswa sarma says the legislation is not against islam.

All eyes on Delhi



NEW DELHI: Karnataka Congress’s internal power tussle appears to be heading towards a decisive climax, with the AICC high command expected to take a final call on the leadership question as early as Saturday. Chief minister Siddaramaiah now faces a renewed challenge from deputy CM DK Shivakumar’s camp, whose supporters are camping in Delhi and seeking an audience with the party’s top leadership to press for Shivakumar as the next chief minister.The power struggle has been simmering since the government crossed its 2.5-year mark, reviving talk of a 2023 power-sharing formula that allegedly promised rotation of the top post. The ongoing debate, once confined to closed-door negotiations, is now public, vocal and intense, prompting senior leaders and MLAs to take positions as the party’s high command prepares to intervene.A crucial meeting of the Congress brass is likely to take place this weekend, with Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge confirming: ""The high command Rahul ji, Sonia ji and I will together take a decision to resolve this issue."" Delhi sources indicate that both Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar may be called in together to settle the question of succession and end the spiral of speculation that has dominated Karnataka’s politics for weeks.According to multiple party insiders, the AICC leadership wants the crisis settled before Parliament convenes on December 1 and before the state assembly session begins a week later. The message issued to both factions is clear: maintain discipline, avoid public statements and wait for the final decision. Priyank Kharge’s discreet visit to Delhi and the instruction asking MLAs lodged in the capital to return suggest that the window for bargaining is narrowing.While both sides have publicly maintained they will accept whatever the high command decides, the political undercurrent remains charged. Back-channel meetings, including a late-night huddle between Shivakumar and minister Satish Jarkiholi, have added fuel to speculation of an impending power shift.In Bengaluru, skirmishes for influence and cabinet positioning continue. But the high command appears firm that internal sabre-rattling must stop as the leadership decision nears.Shivakumar’s supporters argue the leadership change is overdue as per the “understanding” reached when the Congress returned to power with 140 seats in the 2023 assembly elections. Several MLAs backing Shivakumar have travelled to Delhi, and ministers in his camp believe the promise of rotational leadership cannot be abandoned halfway.One of Shivakumar’s aides insisted after the Jarkiholi meeting that the deputy CM only sought support to ensure the “unwritten pact” is honoured. Shivakumar, while refusing to openly confirm the deal, has not denied it either.On questions about a transition, he said: ""There are no personal issues here. The party decides everything. The CM post or high office is unimportant. What is important is working together with everyone and bringing the party back to the helm.""At another interaction, he reiterated confidence in the party’s decision-making framework: ""My party is there to take care of my interests."" He added, ""Whatever discussions happened over the power-sharing, it happened within four walls. I will not discuss that in public.""For Shivakumar loyalists, their leader’s organisational strength and perceived role in delivering the 2023 victory give him a rightful claim. But they emphasise that the final word rests with the top leadership.Siddaramaiah remains firm that he intends to complete the full five-year term, rejecting speculation that he might willingly vacate the chair midway. Speaking in Delhi, he said, ""I will be chief minister for a full five-year term."" The CM has also urged the high command to bring closure to what he described as unnecessary speculation and recurrent political noise.Sidda has repeatedly stated that legislators are free to express opinions, but decision-making authority rests with the high command. ""Let them (legislators) go, MLAs have freedom. Let's see what opinion they give. Ultimately, the high command has to make the decision. We will abide by what the high command says.""On cabinet reshuffle demands, emerging simultaneously, he remained non-committal: ""It will happen when the high command says.""For Siddaramaiah’s supporters, any hurried transition risks destabilising governance, diluting the AHINDA social coalition, and weakening Congress ahead of the 2028 election cycle.The political theatre intensified when deputy CM Shivakumar held a quiet midnight meeting with Satish Jarkiholi, a minister believed to be closer to Siddaramaiah. The meeting, which ran past midnight, raised eyebrows as both camps claimed leadership influence in Belagavi. Shivakumar framed the interaction as coordination work, saying, ""I am the party president, Satish is the working president. Besides, we are close friends. Our relationship is good and we have worked together.""Jarkiholi responded in a similar tone, emphasising neutrality: ""There is nothing wrong in making such claims… but who will finally decide? That happens in Delhi. All that we can do is just make a claim.""He later confirmed plans to meet party president Mallikarjun Kharge personally, stating that Siddaramaiah too wished for a swift resolution to the leadership question.The argument for rotation is not restricted to ministers. MLAs too have taken public positions in favour of Shivakumar. Kunigal MLA HD Ranganath said, ""For me, my political Guru is DK Shivakumar… Every leader today says that Congress got 140 seats due to his efforts.""Adding further, he said, ""It is obvious to expect that the high command should decide keeping in view the wishes of Congress workers, cadres and the voters of Karnataka.""But the leadership has made it clear that public commentary carries consequences. Several MLAs have already received warnings and show-cause notices for airing internal demands openly. Party strategist Randeep Singh Surjewala earlier signalled continuity, saying there would be no leadership change, and on July 11 Siddaramaiah had already asserted a full-term commitment.With statements multiplying, the high command faces a delicate balance — pacify MLAs, protect government stability, and neither alienate Siddaramaiah nor Shivakumar.Meanwhile, external pressure on the Congress leadership has grown with Adichunchanagiri Mutt seer Nirmalanandanatha Swami publicly stating that the Vokkaliga community had stood behind the party in the 2023 election with the expectation that DK Shivakumar would be made chief minister. Speaking to the media at Kundur Mutt in Channarayapatna taluk on Wednesday, the seer said, ""However, he missed the chance in the changed scenario. ""Reiterating his support for Shivakumar’s long-pending claim, Nirmalanandanatha Swami stated that the Congress must factor in both his contribution and the aspirations of the community when deciding on the leadership question.The opposition BJP has seized on the Congress leadership crisis to mount fresh political pressure, arguing that governance has stalled as Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar remain locked in a power struggle. In a statement issued on Wednesday, BJP state president BY Vijayendra said the government must either bring clarity to the chief ministership or step aside and seek a fresh mandate.""Let them postpone the session or if they are unable to handle the situation, resign and declare the election,"" he told reporters in Bengaluru.The BJP accused the Congress of neglecting critical issues, particularly farmers who have been protesting for nearly a month over compensation demands. Vijayendra stated, ""When farmers are in distress and are seeking answer and compensation from the state government, they (Congress) should come to Belagavi with proper compensation package for the farmers.""He further claimed that ministers and MLAs have spent more time in New Delhi than in Karnataka over the past month, stating, ""There is internal fighting going on within the ruling Congress government and it is no secret that for the past one month cabinet ministers and MLAs are more in New Delhi rather than Karnataka.""Mocking the leadership, the BJP suggested the upcoming legislature session be shifted to Delhi, with Vijayendra remarking, ""I think it is appropriate for the CM to decide to hold the legislative session in Delhi rather than Belagavi since the entire cabinet is camping in Delhi.""While asserting that BJP is not interested in who stays or goes, Vijayendra said the party is worried about governance and public welfare. ""We are not bothered whether Siddaramaiah will continue or will be replaced. BJP's only concern is the condition of the state. Farmers are on strike for the past one month. Government should resolve this issue,"" he said.With the decision window narrowing, Congress leadership now has three realistic options:This route maintains continuity, protects AHINDA influence, and sends a signal of stability. A cabinet reshuffle may be sanctioned later as compensation to placate those backing Shivakumar.Backers of DKS see this as honouring commitment and preventing factional drift. But replacing a sitting CM at the midpoint could cause internal rupture if not managed delicately.A future-dated swap could satisfy both camps temporarily, provided the timeline is seen as credible and binding. It is the most politically pragmatic formula, but only works if both factions stand down simultaneously.As the Congress top command prepares to make the call, Karnataka waits for clarity after months of circular speculation. The outcome will not just decide who leads, but how Congress governs, fights the 2028 election and retains its strongest southern bastion.The answer to Karnataka’s political puzzle now rests with three people — Sonia Gandhi , Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge.",'all 140 mlas are mine': dk shivakumar amid karnataka cm speculation; siddaramaiah responds.saturday verdict expected: high command signals final call on leadership question.

NEW DELHI: National Medical Commission (NMC) has turned down a proposal from Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence (SMVDIME), Katra, seeking to place 100% of its 50 MBBS seats under the All-India Quota (AIQ) through the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC).An NMC official said the commission did not approve the request as it would go against policy. Such decisions require broader consultation with states and stakeholders, and existing regulations cannot be amended for a single institution.

Several Hindu organisations, including Sanatan Dharam Sabha and Vishwa Hindu Parishad, have protested over 43 out of the first batch of 50 MBBS students reportedly being from a particular community.The groups hold that since the institute is funded by devotees of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi, it should attract students from across the country rather than just one community or region.""As of now, 100% of candidates are from the state,"" an official confirmed, adding the college was seeking all-India quota allocation to widen the pool for intake of students.On Sept 8 last year, SMVDIME - located at the base camp of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi shrine - was sanctioned 50 MBBS seats, paving the way for admissions to its first batch in the 2025-26 academic session.The institute began functioning in Nov last year from the administrative block of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University.","Shri mata vaishno devi institute of medical excellence sought to place 100% of its 50 mbbs seats under the all-india quota (aiq) national medical commission (nmc) has turned down the proposal.

2026 battle: A fight for space, or a fight for existence?

“The river Ganga flows to Bengal via Bihar. And the victory in Bihar, like the river, has paved the way for our victory in Bengal,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared after the NDA’s thumping victory in recently-concluded Bihar elections.The message left little ambiguity: Bengal is BJP 's next battlefied. Once a marginal player in the state, the BJP now views Bengal as a winnable frontier. Congress , meanwhile, delivered one of its weakest performances in Bihar, managing to win just six seats and inviting fresh questions about its relevance in key electoral battlegrounds.And that is where Bengal 2026 becomes a far more complicated puzzle for the party. With Mamata Banerjee dominating the state and the BJP rapidly expanding its footprint, the Congress now faces its most uncomfortable question yet: in 2026, who is its real opponent — Mamata, its INDIA bloc partner who leaves little room for it in Bengal, or the BJP, whose rise threatens to erase it altogether?The extent of Congress’s continued decrease in relevance in Bengal becomes clear when you track its trajectory across the last three assembly elections. In 2011, when Mamata Banerjee first swept the Left out of power, Congress was still a meaningful partner in the coalition, winning 42 seats and retaining influence across Murshidabad, Malda and pockets of North Bengal.Five years later, in 2016, even though it fought in alliance with the Left, Congress' seat count slightly increased to 44, but its vote share and organisational strength were already waning.Also read: Issue instructions to deport illegals from Bengal, BJP tells EC By 2021, the floor gave way almost entirely. Congress contested 92 seats and drew a blank, finishing third or fourth in nearly every constituency and slipping to a 3% vote share—its weakest performance in Bengal’s electoral history.The party was wiped out in former strongholds like Malda Town and Sujapur, where the TMC and BJP split the anti-incumbency space between themselves.It is this collapse that now frames the 2026 dilemma.The BJP’s growth in Bengal has been one of the most dramatic political expansions of the last decade. In 2016, the party won only 3 seats.In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the party stunned many by bagging 18 out of 42 seats, a performance that immediately repositioned Bengal as the BJP’s most promising frontier outside the Hindi heartland.But by the time the 2021 assembly election arrived, the BJP had transformed itself into the state’s principal opposition, capturing 77 seats and securing nearly 38% of the vote share.This is what makes 2026 a high-stakes equation for the Congress. If the BJP continues its current trajectory, Congress risks being pushed out of the contest entirely.Also read: Left in lurch - With Red fading in West Bengal and Tripura, will Kerala's communists find their direction? Adding to the Congress’s dilemma is Mamata Banerjee’s consistent refusal to cede space or treat the party as an equal stakeholder in Bengal. Her political instinct has always been solo-first, and she has signalled that repeatedly, both through her words and her actions.In the run-up to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Mamata declared that the TMC would fight all 42 seats in Bengal alone, refusing to enter a seat-sharing arrangement with the Congress and stating that the INDIA bloc was “only for Delhi, not Bengal.”Mamata Banerjee has also very openly expressed dissatisfaction with the functioning of the INDIA bloc in the past and signalled her intent to take charge of the alliance if given the opportunity.""What can I do if they cannot run the show? I do not lead the front. Those who are in leadership positions there should think about it. But still, I am maintaining my connections with the regional and national parties,"" Mamata had said. ""There are some who cannot tolerate me. If given the responsibility, though I do not want that, I can run it (INDIA bloc) from West Bengal. But I do not want to stay away from Bengal. I was born here and will die here,"" the West Bengal chief minister had added.Earlier this year, Mamata Banerjee asserted that the Trinamool Congress will return to power with a two-thirds majority in the 2026 assembly elections in the state and ruled out the possibility of stitching any alliance with the Congress, according to the TMC's mouthpiece.The mouthpiece 'Jago Bangla' reported that Banerjee made these remarks during a meeting of the TMC legislative party on Monday. According to that report, Banerjee told her legislators, ""Trinamool will return to power with a two-thirds majority in 2026. We do not need anyone's help. We will fight alone and win alone.""Beyond vote share, Congress's decline is most evident in regions it once dominated.In 2016, Congress was still a recognisable force in Bengal. It won 44 seats, many of them concentrated in Malda and Murshidabad — districts where TMC struggled to break through at the time. English Bazar, Chanchal, Sujapur, Beldanga, Kandi and Naoda were still Congress ground, with functioning booth networks and leaders voters identified with.But by 2021, that map collapsed almost overnight. Congress won zero seats.What was competitive turf in 2016 became abandoned land by 2021.All of this funnels into the question Bengal now forces on Congress: what does the party campaign for in 2026? Is it aiming for seats, vote share, or simply survival on the political map?Because the numbers leave little room to pretend otherwise.TMC already occupies the incumbent’s space, controls the welfare narrative, and shows no intention for alliance. The BJP, on the other hand, has managed to make significant inroads in Bengal and is buoyed by its victory in the recently-concluded elections in Bihar, Delhi, Maharashtra and Haryana.Congress enters 2026 without a clear leader, network, or defined opponent.The real question, then, may no longer be whether Congress should fight Mamata or the BJP. The question is whether the party has enough ground left to fight at all.","2026 bengal battle: a fight for space, or a fight for existence?

Samay Raina’s Epic India Comeback: 'Still Alive and Unfiltered' Tour Sells 40k Tickets in One Hour

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday directed comedian and YouTuber Samay Raina, along with three other comedians, to host shows on their platforms featuring specially-abled individuals who have inspiring success stories. The top court said the events should be used to raise funds that would support the timely and effective treatment of persons with disabilities.“We hope and expect that such few memorable events will take place before we hear the matter next. It’s a social burden we are putting on you (comedians) not penal burden. You are all well-placed persons in the society. If you have become too popular, then share it with others”, CJI Kant said.The directions were issued while hearing a plea filed by Cure SMA Foundation, which sought action against comedians for making insensitive remarks about people suffering from disabilities.The case stems from a controversy that erupted months earlier over an episode of Samay Raina’s YouTube show India’s Got Latent. The episode, which involved remarks perceived as mocking individuals with disabilities and rare disorders, sparked debate on the limits of free speech and the boundaries of satire. Raina and the other comedians were first summoned by Mumbai Police and later by the Supreme Court after an NGO filed a petition accusing them of ridiculing vulnerable communities.The row centered on questions of social sensitivity and the pattern of comedy shows crossing lines without accountability. Following the backlash, Raina’s YouTube show was ultimately taken down.","The top court said the events should be used to raise funds that would support the timely and effective treatment of persons with disabilities.

When Gujarat lifted its prohibition laws within GIFT City on New Year’s Eve 2023, it made national headlines. For a state where ‘dry’ has been a foundational principle since 1960, the move to create a watering hole where professionals could socialise — even if within the perimeters of India’s first international financial hub — felt audacious.Two years later, the glass remains half full, measured rather than overflowing. Official figures show 985 permanent employees with liquor access permits and 5,291 temporary ones for visitors. With 5,552 bulk litres of liquor sold to date — a modest but telling figure — Gujarat’s experiment with controlled conviviality proves that even in prohibition territory, business pragmatism can find a way.Inside GIFT City, every drink has a paper trail. Gujarat’s first taste of legal liquor operates within one of the most controlled ecosystems in the country: precise, trackable and fenced in by policy.Only those employed with registered firms in GIFT City can raise a glass — and only after securing a two-year access permit, renewable for Rs 1,000 annually. Visitors can join in, but only through one-day temporary permits issued by an authorised recommending officer.Each permit holder is allowed to host up to five guests at a time within licensed ‘wine and dine’ zones — sealed-off spaces inside hotels, clubs and restaurants operating under a designated foreign liquor licence.While there is no official limit on consumption volume, everything is billed and recorded.Even with a valid permit, the glass must stay within these designated zones. Every guest’s name is registered before service, every bill traceable, and yes, even Ahmedabad residents can be invited, provided the meeting is deemed business-related. The guardrails extend beyond the bar counter. Those who drink cannot drive; they must leave with a designated driver. In case of an inquiry, a wine-and-dine bill serves as proof of authorised consumption — every toast documented in detail within Gujarat’s carefully calibrated social experiment.GIFT City’s social scene operates within tight boundaries. Currently, two wine-and-dine facilities serve the zone, with more planned as new commercial towers and hotels open.Taral Shah, a developer working on projects in GIFT City, said: “GIFT City is India’s only operational International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) and smart city, and we have seen interest growing among foreign companies year by year. With liquor norms relaxed, companies from Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru are also setting up base in GIFT City. We expect more facilities as additional buildings become operational. We also hope that taxes will come down because wine-anddine facilities here primarily serve the salaried class. When the govt announced the relaxation two years ago, real estate enquiries in GIFT City saw a sudden jump of 25-30%.”The impact extends beyond realty metrics. An official at one of the licensed wine-and-dine facilities said the relaxation has transformed the sentiment within GIFT City: more employees now stay back in the evenings to catch up over drinks.“On weekdays, we see an average of about 15 people coming in to wine and dine. The number doubles to around 30 on weekends. The VAT is higher than other states, but we expect it to be rationalised soon and brought on a par with other states, which should further drive consumption,” the official said.The shift is reshaping the everyday rhythm at GIFT City as professionals embrace post-work socialisation. “The relaxation of liquor laws is a welcome move. The process of obtaining access is also convenient and easy. GIFT City is successfully creating a lifestyle and culture that matches international standards,” said Dhruv Singh (name changed), a professional working at GIFT City. Small changes signal larger shifts. Earlier, photography was banned at these facilities, but that restriction has been lifted — suggesting that GIFT City is easing into its new culture of controlled comfort.The demographics tell their own story: 15% of visitors at GIFT City’s wine-and-dine facilities are foreigners, while 85% are Indian, primarily employees and their occasional guests. The typical patron is between 26 and 45 years old. Beer dominates, with most patrons preferring to unwind over a pint or light drink after work. Spirits see lower uptake, likely due to both preferences and higher taxation.The licensed facilities operate from 11am and attract some daytime visitors, too, though crowds peak in the evenings. “We’re also seeing small groups using the space for formal and informal business discussions,” said a hotelier.Not every company, however, is ready to raise a toast just yet. Some firms deliberately avoid issuing permission letters for employees to access these facilities.“Our organisation has made a conscious decision to not issue letters to employees for drinking at the wine-and-dine facilities at GIFT City. Since alcohol prohibition continues beyond GIFT City limits, companies are worried about any incident that could tarnish their reputation,” explains Tanya Sharma (name changed), who works with an MNC at GIFT-IFSC.Industry leaders see broader potential. Narendra Somani, president of the Hotels and Restaurants’ Association (HRA), Gujarat, argues that two years of regulated liquor access at GIFT City shows how controlled liberalisation can help build a wineand-dine culture while also generating revenue for the state.“Govt should consider extending such relaxations in a regulated manner across Gujarat, especially with increasing foreign investments in Ahmedabad, a growing expat community, and Gujarat’s bids for the Commonwealth Games 2030 [which it won on Wednesday] and the 2036 Olympics. Gujarat’s hospitality sector loses social and corporate event business to other states. With thoughtful liberalisation, Gujarat’s tourism industry could take a significant leap forward,” Somani said.Sanjay Kaul, IAS, MD and group CEO, GIFT City, said: “The streamlining of prohibition norms specific to GIFT City has been widely welcomed by companies and professionals, who see it as a reflection of the city’s global readiness.”The numbers may appear modest, but they represent Gujarat’s incremental approach to social liberalisation within an economic enclave, carefully avoiding any challenge to the broader prohibition framework across the state.A senior official emphasises that the relaxation aligns with GIFT City’s ambition to position itself as a global financial hub.“Several companies in GIFT City had identified prohibition as a challenge in attracting young talent. Since the relaxation, we have growing traction from global firms and multinational corporations. Previously, semiconductor design companies favoured Bengaluru or Hyderabad. But now, with a semiconductor manufacturing cluster coming up in Gujarat, GIFT City has become a viable alternative,” a GIFT City official said.Recent developments support this claim. Sources confirmed that a European semiconductor design firm recently established an office in GIFT City. “Global corporations require wine-and-dine facilities not just for employees but also for hosting international clients. With world-class infrastructure, airport connectivity, and the recent easing of liquor norms, GIFT City now stands on a par with other global financial hubs,” the official added.GIFT City’s liquor model remains unique: a closed-loop ecosystem where access, sale, and consumption are all verified and logged — an administrative “wet bubble” in an otherwise dry state.As GIFT City expands with new corporate tenants and residential projects, the central question persists: will Gujarat replicate this model elsewhere, or will it remain a singular concession at India’s global financial hub?For now, Gujarat’s controlled experiment continues — each glass raised within GIFT City represents not just a drink, but a data point in one of India’s most closely-watched policy experiments.","Gujarat lifted its prohibition laws within gift city on new year's eve 2023.

NEW DELHI: Stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra has once again landed in controversy -- this time over a photo he shared online wearing a T-shirt that appeared to mock the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The post quickly triggered outrage within the BJP , with the saffron party warning of police action.The row erupted after Kamra posted on his social media accounts a photo of himself in the respective T-shirt. He captioned the photo 'not clicked at a comedy show', hinting at the previous controversy that angered Shiv Sena , resulting in the destruction of the venue of his comedy show.Maharashtra minister and senior BJP leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule said the government would not ignore such posts. “The police would take action against anyone who puts out such objectionable posts,” he warned, responding to Kamra’s picture that showed a dog image alongside a reference to the RSS, the ideological parent of the BJP.Shiv Sena cabinet minister Sanjay Shirsat -- whose party is a BJP ally -- said the saffron party must respond strongly this time, recalling Kamra’s past potshots at both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde . “Earlier, he targeted Prime Minister Modi and Eknath Shinde, and now he has dared to directly attack the RSS. The BJP needs to respond to this,” Shirsat said.“We (Shiv Sena) responded to it (to Kamra's critical comments on Shinde earlier this year).Now, he has mustered the courage to make an objectionable post against the RSS,” he added.This is not Kamra’s first clash with political leaders. In March, he sparked a storm after mocking Shinde during a show by tweaking the lyrics of a popular Hindi film song. Angered by his remarks, Shiv Sena workers later vandalised the Habitat Comedy Club in Mumbai’s Khar -- the venue where Kamra had performed -- as well as the hotel building it is housed in.","Stand-up comedian kunal kamra has once again landed in controversy.

Untold Bravery in Operation Sindoor: CISF Reveals It Foiled Pakistan Attack on Uri Hydro Power Plant

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's retaliation put the Uri hydroelectric plant near the Line of Control (LoC) under significant risk during a high-risk security situation that unfolded after India launched Operation Sindoor . However, the CISF successfully foiled the attempted attack, protecting both the power project and the residents living nearby.On Tuesday, the CISF honoured 19 of its personnel with the director general's disc for their extraordinary courage during this high-risk situation. The awards were presented at a ceremony in the CISF headquarters, where the leadership praised the team for safeguarding a critical national installation during intense cross-border shelling.The CISF provided counterterror security cover to the Uri Hydro Electric Power Projects (UHEP-I and II), located along the Jhelum river in Jammu and Kashmir’s Baramulla district, located 8-10 kms from the LoC.The personnel have been honoured and recognise for their door-to-door evacuation of civilians in the time of high military tensions. The troops evacuated women, children, NHPC (national hydroelectric power corporation) staff and their families -- amidst Pakistani shelling.""Their prompt and fearless actions ensured the safe evacuation of around 250 civilians, preventing any loss of life. Even as rounds landed dangerously close to the premises, the personnel continued to reinforce bunkers, maintain communication lines through POLNET and satellite systems, and provide emergency assistance,"" the statement said.The troops also neutralised ""hostile"" drones targeting Indian installations and secured armoury stockpiles by quickly redistributing weapons to avoid potential destruction, it added.Throughout the crisis, the ""integrity"" of critical national assets remained protected due to the vigilance and preparedness of the CISF personnel, the statement said.Commandant Ravi Yadav, along with deputy commandant Manohar Singh and assistant commandant Subash Kumar, led teams at Uri-I and Uri-II in initiating immediate protective measures for the installations and nearby townships.The personnel recognised include constables, head constables, inspectors and sub-inspectors from both Uri units. Among them are Constables Sushil Vasant Kamble, Raziqe Ahmad Abdul Rafique, Wankhede Ravindra Gulab, Tridev Chakma, Sohan Lal, Mufeed Ahmad, Mahesh Kumar and Sandenaboina Raju; Head Constables Gurjit Singh, Manoj Kumar Sharma and Ram Lal; Inspector Deepak Kumar Jha; Sub-inspectors Anil Kumar and Deepak Kumar; and Assistant Sub-Inspectors Rajeev Kumar and Sukhdev Singh.According to the CISF, ""They carried out real-time analysis of incoming shell trajectories, identified safe zones and organised the relocation of residents to bunker shelters.""India launched Operation Sindoor on the intervening night of May 6-7, under which 9 major terror hideouts were blown to bits in Pakistan and PoK. This counterterror action was taken as a strong retaliatory measure after a Pakistan-sponsored terrorist attack in South Kashmir's Pahalgam.","Pakistan's retaliation put the uri hydroelectric plant near the line of control (loc) under significant risk.

Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Thursday remanded four students to two-day police custody and sent 13 others to one-day judicial custody for allegedly raising pro-Maoist slogans during last week's anti-pollution protest at India Gate.While being taken to court, one of the students alleged sexual harassment by male Delhi Police officers in custody.“We were harassed by male police officers… we were sexually harassed. We were subjected to fake medical tests. I was groped by male police officers,” she said.Judicial Magistrate Sahil Monga on Thursday heard the case registered at the Sansad Marg police station against 17 accused students — including 11 women — for multiple offences under the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS), such as disobedience to a public servant’s order, assault or use of criminal force to deter a public servant, obstruction, conspiracy to commit offences against the State, and wrongful restraint.The Delhi Police sought seven-day custody of five accused for further investigation, and requested an extension of judicial custody for the remaining twelve.On November 23, a total of 23 students were arrested after two FIRs were lodged at the Kartavya Path and Parliament Street police stations in connection with the incident. They are accused of raising slogans and displaying posters in support of Maoist commander Madvi Hidma, who was killed on November 19 in an exchange of fire with security forces in Andhra Pradesh’s Maredumilli forest area in the East Godavari district.According to police, the group also used pepper spray on personnel who attempted to restrain them.",A delhi court on thursday remanded four students to two-day police custody. 13 others were sent to one-day judicial custody for allegedly raising pro-maoist slogans.

'Your Future Is Being Stolen': Rahul Gandhi's Bold Message to India's Gen Z For Democratic Change

NEW DELHI: Disproportionate focus on SIR/vote chori at the cost of crucial local issues of cost of living, migration and corruption was cited by some senior functionaries as a reason for the decimation of Congress in Bihar, as they urged the central leadership to fix accountability for the defeat if the party is serious about reviving itself in the state.Some local functionaries listed three reasons for the defeat: govt's payment of Rs 10,000 to women during the polls, booth manipulations and a lack of coordination among partners. The AIMIM was also blamed for division of minority votes in Seemanchal region and beyond. It was alleged that BJP had used a ""basket of tools"" to ""fix"" the polls which spanned SIR, EVMs, the buying of votes and use of the administration against opposition candidates. Days after the Bihar debacle, the AICC brass of Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi and KC Venugopal held a review of the poor show with poll candidates and MPs.Around 70 members met the leadership in batches. Before the meetings started and top netas arrived, two losing candidates were reported to have clashed over the reasons for the defeat - with one taking exception to the other advocating violence against ""outsiders"" who got party tickets.Some claimed that the idea of meeting the state functionaries in batches was also to avoid a potential clash in a large gathering.A politician is said to have found fault with the manner of candidate selection which, he said, cost the party heavily. He is said to have told Rahul Gandhi that just like he had taken responsibility for the defeat in 2019 Lok Sabha polls and stepped down as party president, heads should roll in the state too - in what was a veiled jibe at AICC in-charge Krishna Allavaru - an issue that was also raised by other members, sources said. A section of party members also targeted the alliance with RJD, saying the ally brings some votes but also polarises other communities. It was also demanded that Congress break the alliance with RJD. However, at one group meeting, Rahul is said to have rebuffed it by asking why the party failed on seats that witnessed ""friendly fights"" with Congress and RJD in the fray against each other.Questions were asked about the weightage given by Congress to caste census with arguments that victory of candidates from individual upper castes is vastly higher than their population share, while that from some large OBC communities is just in line with their numbers - in a veiled reference to the advocacy of ""share as per population"" slogan.","Some local functionaries listed three reasons for the defeat: govt's payment of rs 10,000 to women during the polls, booth manipulations and a lack of coordination among partners.

NEW DELHI: To make civil services future ready and to achieve the goal of a developed India, the principal secretary to PM, P K Mishra , Thursday suggested three guiding principles — “reorienting the purpose of civil services to developmental state, re-imagining selection to identify deeply capable individuals and building a lifelong learning state”.Addressing the centenary conference of Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), the country’s top bureaucrat also spoke about a shift from process compliance to outcome delivery; from incremental improvement to accelerated transformation; from siloed govt departments to interoperable digital infrastructure; and from a state that delivers to citizens to a state that partners with citizens.In a statement, the PMO said Mishra underlined how emergence of technology, urbanisation, climate challenges and frequent disasters have reshaped the responsibilities of civil servants, and today’s governance demands collaboration more than hierarchy.Highlighting the world is becoming more interconnected and volatile, with strategic competition spanning technology, supply chains, data, cybersecurity, AI, space and critical minerals, he said civil servants are managers of uncertainty, interpreters of complexity and guardians of India’s strategic interests, and their readiness must begin with how they are selected.","Principal secretary to pm, p k mishra, suggested three guiding principles.

Superbugs now resistant to key everyday antibiotics: ICMR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/superbugs-now-resistant-to-key-everyday-antibiotics-icmr/articleshow/125626275.cms,"NEW DELHI: Some of the most common infections - urinary tract, pneumonia, sepsis and diarrhoeal illnesses - are becoming increasingly harder to treat in India as widely used antibiotics continue to fail at alarming rates.ICMR's annual report 2024 'Antimicrobial Resistance Research & Surveillance Network (AMRSN)', showed that routine drugs like fluoroquinolones, third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and piperacillin-tazobactam are rapidly losing effectiveness against bacteria most frequently seen in hospitals.Based on nearly one lakh lab-confirmed infection samples from leading hospitals, the report showed drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria continue to dominate. E coli, the most common cause of UTIs and abdominal and bloodstream infections, showed declining susceptibility to strong antibiotics. Klebsiella pneumoniae, a major cause of pneumonia and sepsis, is resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam in nearly three-fourths of the cases and to carbapenems in most samples, limiting treatment options.In ICUs, the situation is even more alarming. Acinetobacter baumannii shows 91% resistance to meropenem, forcing doctors to use more toxic or complicated drug combinations.Pseudomonas aeruginosa continues to show rising resistance. Overall, 72% of bloodstream infections were caused by drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, while ventilator-associated pneumonia was driven largely by acinetobacter, klebsiella and pseudomonas - organisms against which many commonly prescribed high-end antibiotics are ineffective.Though some isolated improvements were seen - including better sensitivity of E coli to amikacin and select cephalosporins - the broader resistance landscape continues to worsen. Diarrhoeal pathogens showed high resistance to fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins, and more than 95% of salmonella yyphi samples were resistant to fluoroquinolones. Among fungi, candida auris showed resistance in nearly 10% of isolates, while one-third of aspergillus samples were resistant to amphotericin B.ICMR said the data reflects hospital infections, not community patterns. But experts warn the message is unmistakable: India's most widely used antibiotics are losing power, and critically ill patients are already facing the consequences. Without aggressive stewardship and rational prescribing, they caution, even common infections may soon become untreatable.Dr Rommel Tickoo, director, internal medicine, Max Hospital, Saket, said the findings mark a dangerous shift. ""Strong antibiotics are failing against infections once treated easily. This signals an urgent public-health challenge that demands tighter control on antibiotic use and stronger infection-prevention measures.""Data shows how quickly options are shrinking. ""Everyday bacteria are resisting medicines we once relied on. In ICUs, choices are narrowing even further. Rational antibiotic use is no longer optional - it's essential to preserve what still works,"" Dr Rakesh Gupta, senior consultant, internal medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, said.","Routine drugs like fluoroquinolones, third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and piperacillin-tazobactam are rapidly losing effectiveness.

"EC illegally seeking citizenship proof through SIR, Cong & RJD say in SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-illegally-seeking-citizenship-proof-through-sir-cong-rjd-say-in-sc/articleshow/125624888.cms,"'Your Future Is Being Stolen': Rahul Gandhi's Bold Message to India's Gen Z For Democratic Change

NEW DELHI: Congress general secretary K C Venugopal and RJD MP Manoj Jha on Thursday told Supreme Court that the Election Commission has no power to determine citizenship of a voter, yet through an ""unconstitutional"" pan-India Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of state electoral rolls is seeking proof of Indian citizenship from voters.Jha's counsel Kapil Sibal told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that the kind of documents that are being sought from voters through enumeration forms under SIR will disfranchise lakhs and lakhs of voters who would not have documents to show their date of birth, landholding ownership or parents birth certificates. ""That is why we are insisting that Aadhaar must be the basis for enrolment in voter list,"" Sibal said.For Venugopal, senior advocate A M Singhvi said the basis and ground for SIR are both wrong. EC is conducting a pan-India SIR when Representation of the People Act empowers it to conduct it for a constituency. The SC asked if the reason for SIR is to eliminate the dead from the voter list, would such a reason confine the exercise to one constituency or all constituencies?Singhvi, also appearing for TMC MP Mahua Moitra and NGO People's Union for Civil Liberties, agreed with Sibal and said the entire exercise is exclusionary.""EC is conducting this exercise with a figment of imagination that masses of illegal migrants are marauding across India. And, the procedure adopted for conducting this exclusionary exercise is neither prescribed by the Constitution nor the RP Act,"" he said.Venugopal's counsel said, ""There had been several revisions of electoral rolls since 2003. On one hand, EC is not asking those whose names figure in the 2003 voters' list for any document. On the other hand, a voter enrolled after 2003 is being discriminatorily asked to prove everything, including citizenship.""""Through this exercise to illegally seek proof of citizenship, EC is converting itself into a citizenship tribunal, which is beyond its constitutional mandate. EC can supplement the process prescribed in the RP Act, but not supplant it,"" Singhvi said.Sibal said teachers and other govt employees are engaged as booth level officers (BLOs) who have neither the knowledge nor expertise in scrutinising documentary proofs of citizenship nor are they legally empowered to do so as determination of citizenship is entrusted to the ministry of home affairs.Countering Sibal's assertion, EC counsel Eklavya Dwivedi said BLOs do not scrutinise documents. This is being done by electoral registration officers, who are SDM-level bureaucrats. Sibal said it is the BLO who scrutinises documents and sends doubtful cases to ERO. The arguments would continue Tuesday.",Congress general secretary k c venugopal and rjd mp manoj jha told supreme court that the election commission has no power to determine citizenship of a voter.

Panjab Univ senate polls get nod after year-long impasse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/panjab-univ-senate-polls-get-nod-after-year-long-impasse/articleshow/125624269.cms,"NEW DELHI/CHANDIGARH: In a breakthrough for Panjab University's long-stalled governance process, Vice-President C P Radhakrishnan - in his capacity as the university's chancellor - has approved the schedule for the senate elections, setting the stage for a full restoration of the institution's decades-old democratic structure. The communication, issued by the VP's Secretariat to PU vice-chancellor Renu Vig on Thursday, formally ends months of uncertainty and a student-led agitation.The mood on campus immediately shifted from tension to celebration, but PU Bachao Morcha said its protest was not yet over, and that further negotiations would take place on pending demands. VC Vig briefly stepped out to meet the protesters and urged them to call off the dharna.The elections for various constituencies of the91-member senate, the university's top decision-making body, will be held between Sept 7 and Oct 4, 2026, with polling and result dates notified constituency-wise.The previous senate's term ended in Oct 2024, but fresh elections had remained in limbo for more than a year.The development marks a positive turn after weeks of protests led by the PU Bachao Morcha, which had been pressing the administration to announce the poll schedule.Students had launched their agitation earlier this year in response to the Centre's Oct 28 notification proposing sweeping changes to the composition and powers of the senate and syndicate. After meeting the students, the education ministry withdrew the notification on Nov 7, fully restoring the electoral system.The VP's Secretariat communication confirmed the approval based on PU's proposal submitted on Nov 9.The Morcha said the protest would continue until it received written assurance on three pending matters: quashing of FIRs against 14 students booked during a previous senate protest in 2024, rollback of recently introduced SOPs regulating elections and student activities, and scrapping of the committee formed to review demands raised by Haryana students regarding representation and possible college re-affiliation.","Vice-president c p radhakrishnan - in his capacity as the university's chancellor - has approved the schedule for the senate elections.
