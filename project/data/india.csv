MOHALI: Trouble mounted for dismissed Punjab police DSP Gursher Singh Sandhu as in a fresh development, the vigilance bureau registered a case against him and his mother Sukhwant Kaur for allegedly possessing assets disproportionate to known sources of income.The action stems from a wider probe linked to the controversial interview of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi recorded while he was in custody of Punjab police.According to vigilance officials, DSP Gursher Singh earned approximately Rs 26 lakh over three years, but investigations revealed that he spent around Rs 2.59 crore in the same period — an amount nearly 10 times his official income.The case was registered by the flying squad of Mohali, and multiple raids are underway to apprehend him. However, sources in vigilance bureau suspect that Gursher has fled abroad.This new case adds another layer to legal troubles of the former police officer, who was dismissed from service in Oct 2024 after being booked for fraud, forgery, and corruption. His pre-arrest bail plea was rejected in January this year by a local court, after which he went untraceable.Gursher, known as an ""encounter specialist"" during his tenure with Mohali Police, is facing serious allegations of extortion, land fraud, and abuse of official position.He is accused of buying disputed land parcels at throwaway prices and selling them at inflated rates, as well as filing false complaints through proxies to extort money from victims.One such victim approached the Punjab and Haryana high court, which subsequently ordered the registration of an FIR against him. The case includes charges under Sections 419, 465, 467, 468, and 471 of the IPC, along with provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.Gursher is alleged to have played a key role in facilitating televised interview of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi at the CIA staff office in Kharar. At the time, Gursher was serving as DSP (investigation), Mohali, and was frequently stationed at CIA office in Kharar.The interview caused a political and public uproar, prompting intervention from the high court, which led to his dismissal from service and suspension of seven other police officials. The vigilance bureau has intensified its manhunt for Gursher and is expected to widen its probe into his financial transactions, real estate dealings, and possible overseas links.",Dsp gursher singh sandhu and his mother sukhwant kaur are accused of possessing assets disproportionate to known sources of income.

KOLKATA: The hockey stick with which ex-Trinamool Chhatra Parishad union president Manojit Mishra inflicted a head injury on the 24-year-old Kolkata law student he and two others allegedly gang-raped on campus last Wednesday now sits inside an evidence bag at Lalbazar, the city police headquarters. So do the red kurta, light brown six-pocket trousers and black shorts the prime suspect was purportedly wearing during the crime.In four days since the assault, Kolkata Police's special investigation team has moved with urgency and meticulousness that contrast with its contentious handling of the RG Kar Medical College rape-murder case last Aug. Police said Sunday they had collected DNA samples from all three suspects and seized items of clothing from their homes in Kalighat, Tiljala and Howrah, reports Tamaghna Banerjee.From the guard room floor where the crime occurred, forensic teams have retrieved hair strands, said to be evidence of how the survivor fought back before giving up. ""I just lay like a dead body,"" she wrote in her complaint.Police said Sunday they had collected DNA samples from all three suspects and seized items of clothing from their homes in Kalighat, Tiljala and Howrah.From the guard room floor where the crime occurred, forensic teams have retrieved hair strands, said to be evidence of how the survivor fought back before giving up.“I just lay like a dead body,” she wrote in her complaint.The real smoking gun? Mishra’s cellphone. Co-suspects Zaib Ahmed and Pramit Mukherjee – both law students – allegedly filmed the assault on Mishra’s orders, making sure to capture the survivor’s face clearly in the frame. Those videos, sent for verification to the cyber forensics lab in Kolkata’s Salt Lake, tell a story that contradicts Mishra’s claims of “consensual sex” with the woman whose refusal to accept his marriage proposal allegedly triggered the assault.CCTV footage backs the survivor’s version of what happened between 7.30pm and 10.50pm Wednesday. Cameras captured her bolting for the main gate, only to be dragged back to the guard room. They also caught the colour of Mishra’s kurta, later matched to the one seized from his Kalighat home.Based on the footage, investigators have calculated that 25 students were on campus that day, and seven were in the union room just before the assault. Police have asked authorities of the south Kolkata law college to provide their names, phone numbers and addresses.Mishra’s phone also revealed more than just Wednesday’s horror. Sources said investigators found what his circle already knew — a cache of doctored photos of female students, their faces superimposed on pornographic images and shared on WhatsApp groups.The nine-member SIT led by an officer of the rank of assistant commissioner spent Sunday at Pramit’s Howrah home, combing through his computer for more videos. Neighbours protested, but the team – bolstered by the addition of four sub-inspectors, one of them a woman officer – stayed put for two hours. What they found there is still to be disclosed.Sources said a relative of the survivor’s family told police that they were satisfied with the probe for now and are expecting a speedy trial.",Kolkata police's special investigation team has moved with urgency and meticulousness that contrast with its contentious handling of the rg kar medical college rape-murder case last aug. police said sunday they had collected dna samples from all three suspects and seized items of clothing from their homes.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122148412,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1546340,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Then there’s crookery with ambition. What would have been a flight of fancy for most practionists of this art was clandestinely turned into reality by a mother-son duo in Punjab’s Ferozepur sometime in 1997.A World War-II era airstrip, used by Indian Air Force during the 1962, 1965 and 1971 wars as an advanced landing ground, was allegedly sold off by a mother and son in 1997 in connivance with some revenue officials. Now, 28 years later, accused Usha Ansal and her son Naveen Chand have been named in an FIR.The Punjab and Haryana high court had ordered Punjab Vigilance Bureau (VB) chief director to probe the allegation, and the report, filed on June 20, has led to the FIR. The case has been registered under IPC Sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc), 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record), and 120B (criminal conspiracy). DSP Karan Sharma is heading the investigation to identify all those involved in this long-concealed scam involving strategic defence land.The airstrip is in Fattuwala village, very close to Pakistan border. It was only in May 2025, after HC intervention, that the land was finally restored to ministry of defence.The VB inquiry confirmed that the land belongs to IAF. Acquired on March 12, 1945 by the British administration for use in World War II, it has remained in IAF possession and was used in three wars. According to the probe, accused Usha and Naveen, of Dumni Wala village, deceitfully claimed ownership of the land and sold it off in collusion with a section of revenue officials after forging revenue records.The original complaint was filed by whistleblower Nishan Singh, a retired revenue official, but nothing happened for years. In 2021, the commandant of Halwara Air Force Station wrote to Ferozepur deputy commissioner demanding a probe. Still nothing happened.Nishan filed a petition in HC seeking an inquiry. Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the original owner of the land, Madan Mohal Lal, died in 1991. However, the sale deeds were executed in 1997 and the names of Surjit Kaur, Manjit Kaur, Mukhtiar Singh, Jagir Singh, Dara Singh, Ramesh Kant, and Rakesh Kant were shown as owners in the Jamabandi from 2009-10, although the military had never transferred the land to them.HC reprimanded Ferozepur deputy commissioner for inaction, pointing out the potential threat to national security. In his order, Justice Harjit Singh Brar asked Punjab VB chief director to personally verify the veracity of the allegations and, if required, take action. He was asked to conclude the probe within four weeks.","Usha ansal and her son naveen chand have been named in an fir. Airstrip was used by indian air force during the 1962, 1965 and 1971 wars.

Of course, no one can stop me from meeting my own family,” Lalu Prasad's eldest son said.Earlier in May, Tej Pratap had revealed via a social media post that he had been in a relationship for the past 12 years with Anushka Yadav. The confession raised eyebrows, as he married the granddaughter of a prominent Bihar politician in 2018 and is currently involved in a legal battle over divorce.Later, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad expelled Tej Pratap, citing ignorance of moral values and irresponsible behavior.“Ignoring moral values in personal life weakens our collective struggle for social justice.

Those who choose to associate with him should make their own decisions. I have always supported accountability in public life, and obedient members of our family have upheld this principle,” he further added.However, Tej Pratap removed the post and claimed that his Facebook account was ""hacked"". He claimed the post was part of an attempt to ""defame and harass"" him and his family. “My social media account was hacked, and my photographs were wrongfully edited,” Yadav said, referring to the viral post that drew media attention.However, last week, Tej Pratap reportedly hinted in an interview that the social media post was indeed posted by him.","Tej pratap yadav visited his alleged partner anushka yadav in patna on monday.

NEW DELHI: Most parts of India are likely to receive above-normal rainfall in July, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday, warning of potential flooding in Uttarakhand and Haryana.

These include:""We should monitor the catchment areas of rivers such as the Godavari, Mahanadi and Krishna,"" Mohapatra said.

NEW DELHI: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Monday hinted at a possible leadership change in the Karnataka government, saying that the ""party high command has got the power"" to take action.On the question of growing speculation over a possible change of chief minister in October, Kharge said, ""See, that is in the hands of the high command. Nobody can say here what is going on in the high command. This is left to the high command.""""High command has got power to take further actions. But unnecessarily, one should not create problems,"" he added.Meanwhile, chief minister Siddaramaiah dismissed rumours of discord between him and his deputy, DK Shivakumar, saying the government ""will remain intact for five years like a rock.""""What do you think, will I inaugurate Dussehra? DK Shivakumar and I are together, and this government will remain intact for five years like a rock. BJP is known for lies; that's what they do. Sriramulu lost elections and made statements. We are intact and we don't care for any comments from them,"" Siddaramaiah said.“We both are on good terms, no matter who says what,” he added.The two also joined hands to pose in front of the cameras.Meanwhile, Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala met ""disgruntled"" party MLAs to sort out things over the change of guards.Terming the meetings with MLAs as an organisational exercise undertaken by both AICC and Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee, Surjewala said, any news that is circulated in the media about leadership change is only a ""figment of imagination"".This is a continuous exercise for introspection and development of the state. It is a long exercise. It will happen over a period of a month or month-and-a-half, during which he will be meeting party legislators, MPs, defeated candidates, District Congress Committee chiefs, before meeting ministers, chief minister and deputy chief minister, he said.As part of the first phase of his three day visit, Surjewala on Monday held one-on-one meetings with legislators from the Chikkaballapura and Kolar districts, News agency PTI reported citing sources.He is expected to have heard their grievances and collected feedback on the government's functioning, they added.This comes a day after Congress MLA HA Iqbal Hussain renewed speculation about a major political development in Karnataka after claiming that DK Shivakumar can get the chief minister post within the next two or three months.""You all know what our (Congress's) strength was before this government came to power. Everyone knows who put in the struggle, sweat, effort and interest to achieve this victory. His (Shivakumar's) strategy and programmes are history now,"" Hussain said.""I don't believe in speculation. We have full confidence that the high command is aware of the situation and will take an appropriate decision at the right time to give him an opportunity,"" he added.He claimed that the big decision will be made within two to three months, when asked if Shivakumar will get the position this year.""Yes, I'm saying it. The date some leaders are hinting at for revolutionary political developments after September—this is what they are talking about. A decision will be made within two to three months,"" Hussain said.""That's what I'm saying. I'm not beating around the bush; I’m speaking directly,"" he added.However, when asked about Siddaramaiah's son and MLC Yathindra Siddaramaiah brushing off the leadership change as mere speculation, Hussain said that the Congress high command had decided on government formation after the 2023 assembly polls.""We were all together in Delhi then. Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and Mallikarjun Kharge made the decision. Everyone knows that. They will take the next decision too—we'll have to wait and watch,"" he said.Earlier, cooperation minister KN Rajanna also hinted at ""revolutionary"" political developments after September.","Randeep surjewala meets 'disgruntled' mlas to sort out things over the change of guards.

He alleged that “some individuals, driven by personal interests, have misled the central leadership and taken decisions by running the show from behind the curtain.”Singh, a three-time MLA, said he could no longer stay silent or pretend that everything was fine within the party. “This is not about personal ambition, this letter reflects the pain and frustration of lakhs of loyal BJP Karyakartas and supporters who feel sidelined and unheard,” he stated.He warned that this shift in leadership risked undermining the efforts of grassroots workers and “pushing the party into avoidable setbacks.”“We had the best opportunity in years to bring the BJP to power in Telangana. But that hope is slowly being replaced by disappointment and frustration, not because of the people, but because of the leadership being placed at the helm,” he wrote.Singh said he was resigning from the BJP with great sadness and urged Kishan Reddy to inform the Speaker of the Telangana Legislative Assembly that he no longer represents the party.","Telangana bjp mla t raja singh on monday resigned from the primary membership of the party.

He alleged the trick was pulled off by erasing the ink that is dabbed on the finger after the casting of vote.Given data presented by Chavan, sources said, the party is likely to scrutinise polling lists and records of other constituencies.The data was presented in a meeting of senior state functionaries.A senior neta said Rahul Gandhi 's charge that there was an increase of 41 lakh voters between 2024 Lok Sabha elections and the assembly polls five months later is correct, but crucial to the conundrum is who were these new voters.

CEC allays oppn fears of Bihar 'disenfranchisement',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cec-allays-oppn-fears-of-bihar-disenfranchisement/articleshow/122169585.cms,"NEW DELHI: Chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar on Monday stepped forward to allay the opposition's fears regarding ""disenfranchisement"" on account of the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of the Bihar electoral roll, saying the objective of the exercise is to simply ensure that no eligible voter is left out, while also keeping the roll free of any ineligible voter.This is in line with the duty cast upon the Election Commission by Article 326 of the Constitution, which requires only an Indian citizen above 18 years of age and ordinary resident in that constituency, unless disqualified, to be enrolled. Kumar told TOI EC is deploying over 1 lakh volunteers to assist the elderly, sick, persons with disabilities (PwDs) and other marginalised groups in filling up their enumeration forms.In a statement on Monday, EC reiterated that over 4.9 crore electors included in Bihar's electoral roll from 2003 - when the last such intensive revision was conducted - need not submit any document other than their filled-up enumeration form. The 2003 roll will be treated as probative evidence of eligibility, including presumption of Indian citizenship unless any input is received otherwise.They only need to verify details from the 2003 roll - now uploaded on the EC website and hard copies of which are being provided to booth level officers (BLOs) - and return the filled-up enumeration form to the BLO.Even children of these 4.9 crore electors will only have to submit their own citizenship proof from a list of 11 specified documents, and not any documents related to the birth of their parents. ""This is because any children born to parents included as electors in the 2003 Bihar roll are Indian citizens by birth,"" said an EC official. ""Thus, nearly 60% of Bihar's (current) 7.9 crore electorate, would not have to submit any documents. ""Stating that revision of electoral roll is mandatory prior to parliamentary/assembly election or bypoll, EC said it has been conducting annual summary revisions for 75 years. Nine intensive revisions were undertaken between 1952 and 2004, involving an average six-year gap, but the latest was pending for 22 years.""SIR is required as the electoral roll is dynamic and changes due to deaths, shifting of people due to reasons such as migration due to occupation/ education/ marriage, and addition of new voters who have turned 18 years old,"" said the officer.As per Census 2011, there were 454 million migrants in India, up from 315 million in 2001. Even as per the Migration in India Report, 2021, the percentage of migrants in the population was estimated at around 29%, which is more than the winning margin in many of the constituencies.""SIR will introduce complete transparency in the additions/deletions in the electoral rolls through active participation of booth level agents (BLAs) appointed by political parties,"" the officer said, and added that around 1.5 lakh BLAs, including over 47,000 deployed by RJD alone, will monitor each stage of SIR. Interestingly, even as RJD is opposing SIR, its MLA from Hathua Rajesh Kushwaha has released posters educating electors on how to ensure they are enrolled.",Chief election commissioner (cec) gyanesh kumar steps forward to allay opposition's fears.
