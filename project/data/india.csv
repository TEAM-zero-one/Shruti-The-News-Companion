NEW DELHI: A Maoist commander, carrying a reward of Rs 22 lakh on his head, was allegedly killed by his leader for intending to surrender to the Odisha Police, a senior officer said.Anwesh, alias Renu, a native of Sukma in neighbouring Chhattisgarh, was allegedly killed by notorious Naxal leader Sukru on January 29.Anwesh was a divisional committee member (DVCM) and military platoon commander of the KKBN (Kalahandi-Kandhamal-Boudh-Nayagarh) Division, police said.Police in Kandhamal district on Wednesday exhumed his decomposed body from the Pakari reserve forest area under Daringbadi police station limits.“It has been ascertained that Anwesh was killed by Sukru and his associates when the former was preparing to surrender before the Odisha Police along with some other Maoist cadre,” Kandhamal SP Harish BC told PTI.The SP said the body was exhumed following strict legal protocols in the presence of the executive magistrate.“Answesh’s move to surrender was opposed by the leadership. The murder is believed to have been executed by SZCM (State Zonal Committee Member) Sukru, with the assistance of DVCM Sila and ACM (area committee member) Jagesh,” he said.Jagesh was neutralised in an exchange of fire with security forces on February 22 in the Nandabali Reserve Forest area in Kandhamal district.Top officials engaged in anti-naxal operations in Odisha said the incident exposes internal conflicts within Maoist groups over surrendering before the police.","Anwesh, alias renu, a native of sukma in neighbouring chhattisgarh, was allegedly killed by notorious naxal leader sukru on january 29.

NEW DELHI: The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) on Thursday moved to retrieve 38 copies of the now-withdrawn Class 8 Social Science textbook after drawing sharp criticism from the Supreme Court.A bench led by CJI Surya Kant described the content as a “deep-rooted conspiracy to defame” the judiciary.The textbook sparked a judicial backlash after the newly introduced edition outlined key challenges facing the country’s judicial system, including corruption, a heavy backlog of cases, and an inadequate number of judges.However, following strong remarks from the CJI-led bench, NCERT on Wednesday decided to remove references to “corruption at various levels of the judiciary” from the textbook and revised the chapter titled ‘The Role of the Judiciary in Our Society.’In a late-night development, the board announced that it has put the distribution of the newly released textbook on hold after noticing “inappropriate textual material and error of judgement” in the chapter on the judiciary. It said the issue was flagged both internally and by the Department of School Education and Literacy under the education ministry.The CJI said, “Judges of the constitutional and district courts are perturbed by this.I have taken suo motu cognisance of the issue. I will not allow anyone on earth to defame the institution or taint its integrity. Whosoever and however high it may be, I know how to deal with it,” while addressing senior advocates Kapil Sibal, Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Mukul Rohatgi, who raised the matter at the start of proceedings at 10.30 am.The advocates informed the bench of CJI Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi that teaching students of an impressionable age about corruption in the judiciary could bring disrepute to the institution, and urged the apex court to take cognisance of the matter.

The title...nowhere has any adjective or any word that portrays the Yadav community in bad light,"" Justice Nagarathna said. The bench called the apprehensions ""wholly unfounded"" and dismissed the petition.The bench distinguished its earlier order in a similar case related to 'Ghooskhor Pandat' in which it had asked the producer to change the title of that movie.""The expression 'ghooskhor'...means corrupt. Therefore a negative meaning was being attached to the community. In the instant case, no such negativity is attached to the Yadav community.Neither of the reasonable restrictions under Article 19(2) (reasonable restrictions to freedom of speech and expression) under the Constitution are attracted. The name in no way portrays the Yadav community in bad light or any negative way. The writ petition is accordingly dismissed,"" the order said.The petitioner had alleged that the title created an offensive stereotype against the community and raised concerns over the depiction of the female lead. During the hearing, the counsel for the petitioner argued that while they do not oppose inter-community marriages, the film's portrayal of a woman was unacceptable.""A lady cannot be publicised this way,"" the counsel said, adding that the film claims to be based on a true story.However, the bench remained unconvinced, categorising the film as a work of fiction.","Supreme court rejects a plea seeking a ban or a change in the title of the upcoming film, 'yadav ji ki love story' chief of the vishwa yadav parishad said the name reflected the yadav community in bad light in society.

NEW DELHI: The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) on Wednesday speedily moved to drop references of “corruption at various levels of the judiciary” from its new Class VIII social science textbook after drawing fire from the Supreme Court over what a bench led by CJI Surya Kant called a “deep-rooted conspiracy to defame” the judiciary.In a late-night development, the board said it has put on hold the distribution of the newly released textbook after “inappropriate textual material and error of judgement” were noticed in the chapter on the judiciary.

I have taken suo motu cognisance of the issue. I will not allow anyone on earth to defame the institution or taint its integrity.

The advocates told the bench of CJI Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi that teaching students of impressionable mind about corruption in judiciary will bring the institution to disrepute and requested the apex court to take cognisance of the matter.The suo motu case has been listed for hearing on Thursday.I have been receiving hundreds of calls and messages from citizens, judges and judicial officers expressing serious concern,” said CJI Surya Kant.Facing fire from the judiciary, sources in govt were contrite. “The controversial section should not have been written,” said one of them, adding that textbooks should focus on “inspirational aspects” rather than highlight institutional shortcomings in isolation. The inclusion was “inappropriate” and should not have found its way into a school curriculum, sources said of the book, which, as per protocol, must have gone through layers of vetting before being cleared for publishing.Justice Bagchi referred to the basic structure doctrine and said “constitutional integrity to the basic structure is missing in the structure of the textbook”.Sibal said the textbook could have devoted the chapter to working of the judiciary, educated children about the challenges faced by it in deciding cases, and narrated how the institution has largely enjoyed public faith and confidence.Flagging what he called selective targeting of the judiciary, Singhvi said there is no mention of corruption elsewhere, in politics, bureaucracy or business in the textbook. “Is it a presumption that there is no corruption there? We know the state of affairs in politics, bureaucracy and business,” he said, leading the CJI to suspect a “deep-rooted conspiracy” to malign the judiciary.NCERT has called an internal meeting to review the chapter in the social science textbook titled ‘Exploring Society: India and Beyond’.

It is that smaller percentage that brings the entire judiciary into disrepute"".After CJI Surya Kant on Wednesday took suo motu cognisance of NCERT's Class VIII textbook containing reference to corruption in the judiciary and termed it a ""very calculated and deep-rooted conspiracy to malign judiciary"", the step was welcomed by former CJI N V Ramana.Justice Ramana said, ""Should students with impressionable minds be taught about something based on corridor gossip?

Such incidents inevitably have a negative impact on public confidence, potentially eroding faith in the integrity of the system.""In Nov 2010, SC in its order in 'Raja Khan vs UP Sunni Central Waqf Board"" had said something was ""rotten"" in Allahabad HC.

CDSCO to fast-track drug testing clearances,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cdsco-to-fast-track-drug-testing-clearances/articleshow/128786193.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation this week moved to fast-track approvals for new medicines by allowing No-Objection Certificates (NOCs) for laboratory testing to be issued immediately upon receipt of applications — a step aimed at reducing delays in the drug approval process.Under the revised procedure, NOCs for testing new drugs at designated government laboratories will be granted upfront, instead of waiting for prior scrutiny of detailed technical specifications.The change applies to applications seeking permission for import or manufacture of new drugs for sale or distribution, as well as registration certificates for drug imports.Previously, CDSCO reviewed formulation details, dosage form, critical quality attributes and compliance with pharmacopoeial standards before permitting testing. Now, laboratory evaluation will begin immediately, while regulatory review continues in parallel.Testing will be conducted at institutions including the Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission in Ghaziabad, Central Drugs Testing Laboratory in Mumbai, Central Drugs Laboratory at CRI Kasauli and the National Institute of Biologicals in Noida.Applicants must still submit finalised regulatory specifications based on prevailing pharmacopoeial standards and product-specific Quality Management Systems. If specifications are revised after review, a fresh NOC will be issued for re-testing under updated norms.The revised system will take effect from June 1, 2026. The move is expected to ease procedural bottlenecks while maintaining statutory quality checks for new drugs entering the Indian market.","Central drugs standard control organisation moves to fast-track approvals for new medicines.

"Lucknow son kills father: 'Galti se ho gaya': Son's flippant reply on why he shot father, chopped up body — watch",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/galti-se-ho-gaya-sons-flippant-reply-on-why-he-shot-father-chopped-up-body-watch/articleshow/128784030.cms,"A chilling video has surfaced showing a 21-year-old Lucknow man calmly claiming “Galti se ho gaya” (“It happened by mistake”) after allegedly shooting and dismembering his father following a heated argument over exam pressure. The accused from the chilling Lucknow murder case, Akshat, is seen offering the brief remark when questioned about the gruesome crime.

NEW DELHI: ""It happened by mistake,"" was the reason the 21-year-old son gave behind the gruesome act of allegedly shooting and chopping off his father's body after a heated argument.Akshat, the BCom student from Lucknow, when asked about his side of the story, only had these four words to utter, ""Galti se ho gaya.""The 21-year-old uttered the four words while being presented before the media at the Aashiana police station in Lucknow on Wednesday.Further attempts through multiple questions concerning the event were put forth for him to present his side of the story, all of which were answered with mere silence.The 21-year-old man from Lucknow was being pressured by his father to crack the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) examination. In a heated moment, the man took his father's licensed rifle and shot him dead on the spot. His sister was also there at the residence, to whom the man had threatened to keep quiet.The case came to light a few days after the accused himself filed a missing person complaint for his 49-year-old father on February 20.Investigators say the complaint was part of an effort to deflect suspicion.Investigators claim the accused then dragged the body from the third floor of the house to the ground floor, where he dismembered it. Some body parts were reportedly transported in his car and dumped in Sadrauna, while the torso was concealed inside a plastic drum at the residence. The head is yet to be recovered.On Monday evening, police raided the house with the accused in custody and recovered the drum containing mutilated remains.Forensic teams have since been examining bloodstains found in the house and the vehicle. Search operations continue in Sadrauna to locate the missing body parts and reconstruct the sequence of events.“He was in the process of getting rid of the body part when we intervened,” a police source said, adding that sustained interrogation exposed contradictions in his account.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central Zone) Vikrant Vir confirmed that strict questioning led to the breakthrough in the case. Authorities are continuing forensic analysis and witness examination as the investigation progresses.","Akshat, the bcom student from lucknow, was being pressured by his father to crack the national eligibility cum entrance test (neet) the 21-year-old took his father's licensed rifle and shot him dead on the spot.
