NEW DELHI: A musical performance featuring the RSS ""gana geetham"" (prayer song) at a temple in Kottukkal, managed by the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB), has ignited row, with the opposition Congress demanding strict action against those involved.The song was performed by a professional music troupe during a gana mela (musical fest) held in the early hours of Sunday as part of temple festivities . According to PTI, the police said there were also allegations that RSS flags had been erected on the temple premises in connection with the event.Leader of the opposition V D Satheesan called the incident “a matter of grave concern,” citing a high court directive that bars political activity on temple grounds.He urged the TDB to act swiftly and firmly, stating, “Temples belong to devotees. Politicising religious spaces reflects a narrow-minded approach.”Kadakkal police confirmed receiving a complaint from a member of the temple’s advisory committee but said no case had yet been registered.The controversy follows a recent incident in the same police jurisdiction where ""revolutionary songs"" praising the CPM were reportedly performed during another temple festival, further fuelling debate over political influence in religious spaces.","A musical performance featuring the rss ""gana geetham"" (prayer song) at a temple in kottukkal has ignited row.

MEERUT: UP Power Corporation (UPPC) has dismissed a contractual lineman for allegedly waving the Palestinian flag after offering namaz on Eid in the Gagalheri police station area of UP's Saharanpur district.The action came after Saqib Khan , 35, a resident of Kailashpuri village in Saharanpur, posted a photograph of himself holding the Palestinian flag on social media.Police summoned Khan for questioning on the same day and interrogated him for two hours before releasing him without any charges. However, local right-wing groups warned of public demonstrations if action was not taken. TOI attempted to reach Khan for a response, but he was unavailable.UPPC's Baliakheri sub-divisional officer Shishir Kumar Chahi said, ""Khan was posted at the Kailashpur power substation under the Baliakheri electricity distribution division. As soon as the matter came to our notice, his services were terminated immediately. We examined the conduct of other employees as well, but Khan alone was found involved in this anti-national activity.""Another contractual lineman in Meerut, who requested anonymity, said most contracts outline clear terms - ""employees must follow a code of conduct, avoid any anti-national activity, and stay away from corruption or criminal involvement. If these conditions are breached, employers have the right to terminate the contract without delay"".He added, ""The set of rules remains more or less the same in every contract. However, the terms and conditions may vary depending on the company that holds the tender to manage contractual employees. In case of termination, the lineman can challenge the decision in court.""UPPC executive engineer Sanjeev Kumar wrote to the private company that hired Khan, directing them to terminate his services with immediate effect, based on documents accessed by TOI. In his letter, Kumar said Saqib was found involved in ""anti-national activities"" by waving the Palestinian flag and sharing the image online.Saharanpur (city) SP Vyom Bindal said, ""The matter is under investigation and appropriate action will be taken based on the findings of the probe. Our primary concern was to ensure there was no breach of peace.

RAMESWARAM: PM Modi took a swipe at Tamil Nadu's governing DMK over the contentious language issue on Sunday, questioning why politicians from the state sign official letters in English. ""Tamil is a language of pride. I am surprised ... no one signs their name in Tamil,"" he said, urging them to do so.Addressing allegations from DMK-led state govt about insufficient central funds, Modi countered that BJP-led Centre had allocated three times more money to Tamil Nadu than the previous UPA administration, in which DMK was a coalition partner. ""Yet, some people have developed a habit of complaining without reason. They keep crying about issues,"" he said.Modi made the remarks while inaugurating the Pamban vertical lift railway bridge and a series of infrastructure projects worth Rs 8,000 crore across Tamil Nadu.Modi stressed his govt's commitment to Tamil Nadu's development, citing a sharp increase in railway budget allocations for the state - from Rs 900 crore before 2014 to over Rs 6,000 crore this year.Modi also flagged off a new train service between Rameswaram and Tambaram in Chennai.The comments on language come amid DMK govt's opposition to the Centre's three-language policy under NE, which it claims is a move to impose Hindi on the state. Tamil Nadu has historically resisted policies perceived as favouring Hindi over regional languages.Modi countered these concerns, saying: ""I urge everyone to at least sign their names in Tamil to honour this glorious heritage."" He reiterated the Centre's commitment to promoting Tamil globally and urged state govt to introduce medical education in the Tamil language. Modi's visit to Tamil Nadu was his first since beginning his third term as PM. CM MK Stalin did not attend, citing prior engagements in the Nilgiris.Highlighting the Centre's investments in Tamil Nadu's infrastructure, Modi said 77 railway stations, including Rameswaram, are undergoing modernisation. He said 4,000km of roads have been constructed in the state with central assistance since 2014, leading to job creation across multiple sectors.The PM also listed welfare initiatives supported by Centre, saying 12 lakh pucca houses have been built under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, more than 1 crore households have gained access to piped drinking water, and over one crore treatments have been provided under Ayushman Bharat Yojana. ""These initiatives have resulted in savings of around Rs 8,000 crore for Tamil Nadu's families,"" he said.On the recurring issue of Tamil fishermen being detained by Sri Lanka, Modi said Centre had secured the release of 3,700 fishermen over the past decade, including more than 600 in the past year alone, some of whom were facing the death sentence.","Stalin skips modi event, cites prior engagements in the nilgiris.

Maha Kumbh flips the plate as eateries go fully veg in UP towns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maha-kumbh-flips-the-plate-as-eateries-go-fully-veg-in-up-towns/articleshow/120047673.cms,"(With Inputs from Arshad Afzaal Khan in Ayodhya & Rajeev Mani in Prayagraj)

Faith is on the menu in UP's sacred triangle and the writing's on the wall - or rather, the signboards - as it's all about going veggie. The transformation of 'Sanjha Chulha' was as luminous as the bright red signboard that announced it. For 25 years, the popular eatery on Varanasi-Lucknow highway had been a must-stop for lovers of rich, meaty delicacies.But as Maha Kumbh approached, owner Sanjeev Jaiswal found himself watching potential customers hesitate at the threshold. ""We have been popular for our non-veg food. ""We have always kept the kitchens and utensils separate,"" he said. ""Yet, in the months before Kumbh, I noticed people turning away. It was a tough call, but a necessary one.""A week before the sacred gathering began, a fresh sign with green letters on a white background flickered to life below the original signboard - this one bearing the words: PURE VEG . The move proved to be nothing short of a masterstroke. Through the 45-day event and beyond, the restaurant bustled with pilgrims eager for a meal that aligned with their spiritual journey.The sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal, rejuvenated by grand temple projects, has seen its culinary landscape undergo a shift dictated not by chefs or connoisseurs but by faith itself. Two phrases - 'PURE VEG' or 'Shudh Shakahari' - now dominate the signage of eateries in Varanasi, Ayodhya, and Prayagraj.""It's not that people have suddenly abandoned non-vegetarian food,"" said Shankar Shastri, a tourist from Maharashtra. ""But when they come to pay obeisance to Baba Kashi Vishwanath, they choose to go vegetarian. Even the assurance of separate utensils doesn't convince them otherwise.""The shift wasn't merely a passing trend. The winds of change first began stirring in Dec 2021, with rejuvenation of Kashi Vishwanath Dham. They gathered force with consecration of Ram Lalla's idol in Ayodhya in Jan 2024 and completion of the Vindhyachal corridor. The rise of this spiritual triangle reshaped not just the flow of pilgrims but the very nature of food market in the region.""Emergence of Kashi-Ayodhya-Vindhya circuit as a major pilgrimage route between 2022 and 2024 changed everything,"" said Gokul Sharma, president of Banaras Hotels' Association. ""Pilgrims now make up over 80% of the total visitors, and prefer pure vegetarian food.""The impact was felt at every level of food industry. Hotels, even those that traditionally catered to international tourists, noticed a stark shift in demand. ""Among domestic tourists, veg-to-non-veg ratio, which was once evenly split, is now 80:20,"" said Rajiv Rai, general manager of a well-known Varanasi hotel.In Ayodhya, the transformation was more absolute. Eateries that once offered a mix of cuisines transitioned entirely to vegetarian menus ahead of consecration of Ram Lalla's idol. Even global chains adapted - Domino's, for instance, serves only vegetarian food in the town.The shift extended to larger commercial spaces as well. Atul Singh, owner of Ayodhya's Mall of Avadh, recalled how the food court once had non-vegetarian options. ""We served non-veg food before, but we decided to go fully vegetarian,"" he said.Vishal, owner of the newly built Hotel Maan Awadh, initially hired a chef from New Delhi known for his meat dishes. ""But I had to replace him with a pure vegetarian chef later,"" he said.Nowhere was the change more dramatic than in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh, where even household kitchens went meat-free. ""During Kumbh, almost 80-85% of hotels and restaurants turned vegetarian,"" said Harjinder Singh, president of Prayagraj Hotels and Restaurants Welfare Association. The city, which has around 400 restaurants and 280 hotels - not counting roadside eateries - saw an overwhelming shift towards vegetarianism.As the tides of pilgrims receded, so did the absoluteness of change in some places. In Prayagraj, many eateries that had turned exclusively vegetarian during Kumbh have since reverted. ""There was no demand for non-vegetarian food, so we adapted,"" said Raju Jaiswal, owner of a restaurant in city. ""But now that things are back to normal, we serve both options again.""Still, the broader transformation of the region's food culture remains undeniable. The power of faith is rewriting menus, reshaping businesses, and illuminating cities and roads with the unmistakable glow of three simple letters: VEG.","The sacred triangle of kashi, ayodhya, and vindhyachal has seen its culinary landscape undergo a shift dictated not by chefs or connoisseurs but by faith itself.

Amit Shah to pay tribute at Raigad amid Aurangzeb legacy row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amit-shah-to-pay-tribute-at-raigad-amid-aurangzeb-legacy-row/articleshow/120047637.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid the political storm surrounding debates over Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's legacy, Union home and cooperation minister Amit Shah is set to visit the historic Raigad Fort on April 12 to pay homage to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj on his death anniversary.The timing of the visit is significant, as recent weeks have witnessed heated political exchanges and public discourse over historical narratives, especially regarding figures like Aurangzeb. Shah's tribute at Raigad is being viewed as a strong symbolic gesture, reaffirming the central government's alignment with the legacy of Shivaji Maharaj, often portrayed as a national hero who valiantly resisted Mughal expansion.Raigad Fort, once the capital of the Maratha Empire under Shivaji Maharaj, stands as a powerful reminder of a golden era marked by valor, governance, and visionary leadership. Every stone of this hilltop fortress echoes stories of strategic brilliance and resilience. The fort not only served as the administrative nerve cntre of the Maratha Empire but also as a monument to Shivaji Maharaj's enduring legacy of swarajya (self-rule).Political observers suggest that Shah's visit is also aimed at energising the party's base in Maharashtra, a state with deep-rooted reverence for Shivaji Maharaj. With elections on the horizon, invoking Shivaji's legacy may serve both cultural and political objectives.As the political narrative intensifies, the visit to Raigad could further polarise opinions on historical interpretations - a strategy that has often played out on India's complex political chessboard.The visit is expected to draw significant public attention and participation, with state BJP functionaries and local dignitaries likely to accompany the Union minister during the ceremonial tribute.","Union home and cooperation minister amit shah is set to visit the historic raigad fort on april 12.

MADURAI/T'PURAM: CPM politburo member Mariam Alexander Baby was appointed Sunday as the party's new general secretary, becoming only the second from Kerala to hold the position after the state's first CM EMS Namboodiripad. Baby, 71, succeeded the late Sitaram Yechury at CPM's 24th congress in Madurai.Former general secretary Prakash Karat , who briefly served as interim coordinator following Yechury's passing in Sept 2024, has been dropped from the politburo along with his wife Brinda Karat, Tripura ex-CM Manik Sarkar, Surjya Kanta Mishra, Subhashini Ali and G Ramakrishnan. But, sources said, the Karats and Manik Sarkar will serve as special invitees to the central committee in an advisory role.The party's central committee and congress approved the politburo's recommendation for Baby's appointment. But, his elevation faced resistance from the party's Bengal and Maharashtra units, which had proposed All India Kisan Sabha national president Ashok Dhawale for the post.Kerala members rallied behind Baby after five of the politburo's 16 members opposed his appointment, sources said.Baby downplayed reports of internal opposition to his appointment, stressing that his nomination had broad support. ""Mohammed Salim (Bengal CPM state secretary) proposed my name and Ashok Dhawale seconded it,"" he said. According to sources, Prakash Karat endorsed Baby for the role.Kollam-born Baby began his political journey through student activism in Kerala and later became national presidents of SFI and DYFI. He served as a Rajya Sabha MP (1986-1998) and as Kerala's minister for education and culture (2006-2011). In 2012, he was elected to CPM's politburo, becoming its first Christian member.Political allies welcomed Baby's appointment, with Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin extending his congratulations. ""His commitment to secularism, social justice, and federalism will further strengthen ties between like-minded parties,"" Stalin said.CPM also announced a reshuffled politburo, expanding its membership from 17 to 18 and signalling a generational shift within the party.The new body includes Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan, BV Raghavulu, Tapan Sen, Nilotpal Basu, Mohammed Salim, A Vijayaraghavan, Ashok Dhawale, Ramchandra Dome, MV Govindan, Amra Ram, Vijoo Krishnan, Mariam Dhawale, U Vasuki, K Balakrishnan, Jitendra Choudhury, Srideep Bhattacharya and Arun Kumar, in addition to Baby.Pinarayi, 79, secured an exemption within the politburo, as functionaries were generally excluded after surpassing the party's age limit of 75 years.The addition of younger members such as U Vasuki, Vijoo Krishnan, Mariam Dhawale, Srideep Bhattacharya, Amra Ram, and K Balakrishnan marks the party's strategic shift to consolidate its presence nationally and strengthen its influence among workers, farmers, and the marginalised, sources said.CPM's newly constituted central committee comprises 85 members, with one seat remaining vacant.","Five of 16 politburo members opposed baby's appointment as general secretary.

NEW DELHI: Congress veteran and ex-Union finance minister P Chidambaram on Sunday argued that "" economic metric will always be higher than in the previous years,"" as he responded to Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's statement on central funds to Tamil Nadu ""Hon'ble PM and Central ministers constantly say that they have given more money to TN in 2014-24 than was given in 2004-14. For example, Hon'ble PM said that his government has given for railway projects in TN seven times more money than before. Ask a first year student of economics. She will tell you that the 'economic metric' will always be higher than in the previous years,"" Chidambaram, who is from Tamil Nadu and whose party is an ally of the state's ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), posted on X.""The GDP's size is bigger now than before. The size of the central Budget is bigger every year than in the previous year. Government's total expenditure is bigger every year than in the previous year. You are one year older than in the previous year. In terms of 'numbers', the number will be bigger, but is it higher in teems of proportion of GDP or in terms of proportion of total expenditure?,"" he added.The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance governed the country from May 2004 to May 2014. Since then, the National Democratic Alliance of PM Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party has been the nation's ruling coalition.Meanwhile, earlier in the day, PM Modi, without mentioning Tamil Nadu chief minister and DMK boss MK Stalin, called out people who ""cry without any reason.""""Tamil Nadu has a very big role in the journey of a developed India. I believe the stronger Tamil Nadu becomes, the faster India will grow. In the last decade, the central government has allocated three times more money for the development of Tamil Nadu than in 2014,"" the prime minister said while inaugurating the new Pamban Bridge in Tamil Nadu's Rameswaram.""Despite this, some people have the habit of crying without any reason; they keep crying. Before 2014, only Rs 900 crore was received every year for the railway project. This year, Tamil Nadu's railway budget is more than Rs 6,000 crore, and the Government of India is also modernizing 77 railway stations here,"" he further stated.Stalin has repeatedly accused the NDA government of ""neglecting and betraying"" the southern state by not releasing the required funds, stating that the Centre could not accept the fact that the state was growing.BJP national spokesperson Amit Malviya called Chidambaram a ""self-styled oracle of selective economics"" and accused him of criticizing the Modi government for pointing to a ""plainly evident"" fact.""His counter? A smug lecture on GDP and absolute numbers, as though that somehow absolves his party of its poor governance record. Any first-year economics student knows that the Debt-to-GDP ratio is the standard for assessing a country’s debt burden. Is this sheer hypocrisy, or simply proof that your party struggles with the fundamentals of fiscal policy? Or maybe it’s even simpler: perhaps the Congress party ’s collective economic IQ mirrors that of its de facto leader—a man whose strategic “brilliance” is better known for turning everything he touches into a fiasco,"" Malviya posted, possibly referring to Rahul Gandhi, the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha and ex-Congress chief.","Congress veteran and ex-union finance minister p chidambaram on sunday argued that "" economic metric will always be higher than in the previous years"" he responded to prime minister narendra modi's statement on central funds to tamil nadu.

(Whenever there is a decline in righteousness...)"" - a part of the sermon given by Lord Krishna. In front of its main gate, it has a symbolic chariot, meticulously handcrafted from Rajasthani marble stones.
