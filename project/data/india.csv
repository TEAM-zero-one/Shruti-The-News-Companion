The case: Rolex seizure at IGI Airport



Customs order and penalties



₹1.8 lakh as redemption fine

A penalty equivalent to AED 6,250

Warehousing charges accumulated since the seizure

What the court said



The outcome



Why the judgment matters



The broader context



The takeaway



A single high-value product does not automatically mean commercial intent.

Declaration rules must still be followed — non-declaration can attract penalties.

Customs authorities must base decisions on context and evidence, not assumptions.





On March 7, 2024, Mahesh Malkani, an Indian citizen living in Dubai, arrived at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport wearing a Rolex Submariner worth around AED 56,000 (approximately ₹12.7 lakh). Believing he had nothing dutiable to declare, Malkani passed through the Green Channel — reserved for passengers without goods requiring customs declaration.Customs officers, however, intercepted him, seized the watch, and issued a detention receipt. Officials claimed that Malkani had used the wrong channel and violated baggage rules. They further classified the single watch as a “commercial quantity,” implying it was intended for trade rather than personal use.Following the seizure, the Commissioner of Customs at IGI Airport issued an Order-in-Original on January 30, 2025. The order allowed Malkani to redeem the Rolex watch for re-export upon payment of the following:The order required Malkani to complete the redemption within 120 days. Instead of paying, he moved the Delhi High Court , challenging both the classification of the watch as “commercial” and the penalty terms.A Division Bench of Justices Pratibha M. Singh and Sahil Jain heard the case and delivered judgment on September 17, 2025.The High Court upheld the customs department’s right to impose a redemption fine and penalty but disagreed with the classification of the Rolex as a commercial consignment. The judges observed: “Clearly, this Court is of the view that one Rolex watch cannot be held to be a commercial quantity, and there is no reason why the same cannot be kept for personal use.”The bench noted that wearing a high-value watch during international travel does not, by itself, justify treating it as a commercial import. It emphasised that customs officials must take a practical view when distinguishing between personal and commercial use.While the court did not waive the fines or penalties, it extended the redemption deadline to October 31, 2025, allowing Malkani additional time to reclaim his watch. The judgment effectively clears him to retrieve the Rolex after payment, while reaffirming that the mere possession of an expensive item cannot automatically be equated with commercial intent.The High Court also urged customs authorities to avoid arbitrary classifications in future cases, warning that such blanket assumptions may not stand up to judicial scrutiny.The decision clarifies an important grey area in customs enforcement: value alone cannot determine intent. A single high-end item, such as a luxury watch or jewellery, may still qualify as a personal belonging if it is clearly meant for personal use.Legal experts have welcomed the ruling as a sensible interpretation of customs law. Supreme Court advocate Dr. Sujay Kantawala said the judgment “underscores that customs must take a practical view of what counts as personal use versus commercial quantity.”The case also reflects broader judicial concern over how customs officers apply baggage rules, especially to international passengers carrying high-value personal goods.Under Indian customs regulations, travellers arriving from abroad are allowed to carry personal items and gifts up to a certain value without paying duty — currently around ₹45,000 (approximately AED 2,000). Anything beyond that must be declared at the Red Channel.Failure to do so can lead to detention, fines, or confiscation, even if the items are personal. Over the past year, courts have repeatedly reminded customs officials to exercise discretion, particularly when dealing with worn items such as watches or jewellery that are clearly for personal use.The Delhi High Court’s ruling sets a precedent for future customs disputes involving luxury items. It makes clear that:For travellers, the message is equally clear: when in doubt, declare. For customs, the case is a reminder that practicality and fairness must guide enforcement — not just the price tag on someone’s wrist.","Delhi high court rules single rolex watch worn by dubai resident is for personal use, not commercial import.

Zero electricity bills Additional income from surplus electricity





Mumbai: To encourage the economically weaker sections to install rooftop solar panels and give them the opportunity to have ‘zero' monthly electricity bills, the state govt on Monday issued a GR announcing a 90%-95% subsidy for below poverty line (BPL), SC and ST consumers with monthly power consumption below 100 units.For a 1KW solar panel, which can generate around 120 units per month, the cost of installation will be around Rs 50,000. Of this, the Centre will provide Rs 30,000, the state will give a subsidy of Rs 17,500 to BPL consumers, and the rest (Rs 2,500) will be paid by the consumer, the GR stated.For SC and ST consumers with less than 100 units of consumption, the subsidy will be Rs 45,000, and they will have to pay Rs 5,000 (10%).

CPI(ML) rejects offer of 19 seats from Tejashwi's RJD

PATNA/NEW DELHI: As Bihar's governing NDA and opposition INDIA bloc engaged in hectic seat-sharing talks on Tuesday, a day after the Election Commission announced the two-phase assembly poll dates, the opposition alliance was expected to induct two more allies - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and ex-Union minister Pashupati Kumar Paras-led Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party - even as it tried to negotiate seats with its dissatisfied Left constituents.NDA, likely to announce its seat-sharing arrangement on Thursday, too, was trying to iron out wrinkles with its allies, especially with Chirag Paswan's LJP (Ram Vilas).The INDIA bloc, which comprises RJD, Congress , CPI, CPI(M), CPI(ML), and Mukesh Sahni's Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP), met late Monday evening but failed to reach a consensus as CPI(ML) Liberation and CPI wanted more than the number of seats offered and sought shares based on their 2020 performances, according to highly placed sources. Discussions were scheduled to resume on Tuesday evening.CPI(ML) rejected the offer of 19 seats - the same number it had contested in 2020 - from Tejashwi Yadav's RJD as against their demand for between 40 and 45 seats. With the senior leadership seeing this proposal from RJD as neither ""dignified"" nor ""respectable"", it proposed on Tuesday a nearly 25% climbdown to convey to RJD a list of around 30 seats which, sources said, would be ""non-negotiable"".State CPI(ML) secretary Kunal said, ""There is no discontent among us. We want 40 seats but are flexible with our demand.""The ""ball is now in Tejaswi's court"" and ""all options are open"" is what a CPI(ML) source said when asked what would be the course of action if RJD did not agree.Last time, the Left party had won 12 out of 19 seats in the assembly polls and 2 of the 3 seats it fought in the 2024 LS polls as part of ""Mahagathbandhan"". It currently holds 11 seats in the assembly after losing one in a 2024 byelection.CPI also sought ""a reasonable number"" of seats. General secretary D Raja said, ""We will talk to Tejashwi Yadav on Tuesday itself,"" expressing confidence in the opposition alliance's chances. VIP chief Mukesh Sahani confirmed his party expects a ""good number of seats"" and that they would announce candidate names after careful analysis. Rejecting claims of internal discord, he added, ""Nothing has improved on the migration front in the past 20 years. People are forced to leave Bihar in search of petty jobs and face humiliation. I, too, suffered humiliation.""Meanwhile, NDA continued to finalise its seat-sharing arrangements.

CHANDIGARH: Haryana ADGP Y Puran Kumar (52), known as an outspoken IPS officer who flagged irregularities, including alleged caste bias, in his own department, was found dead from a gunshot to the head at his Chandigarh residence Tuesday afternoon.The incident happened a day before he was to take up his new assignment as head of Police Training Centre, Sunaria.Police said Kumar, a 2001-batch IPS officer, shot himself with his gunman's service revolver in the soundproofed basement of his brother-in-law's house in Sector 11. According to a police release, a will and nine-page ""final note"" left by the ADG were recovered along with the weapon. Sources said the note named a few serving and retired IPS officers but didn't divulge its content.His wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar - civil aviation secretary and commissioner & secretary, women and child development dept in Haryana govt - was in Japan as part of a delegation.A native of Andhra, Haryana ADGP Y Puran Kumar belonged to the Scheduled Caste community. He held a BE-computer science degree and was an IIM-Ahmedabad alumnus. He repeatedly challenged his own department, not hesitating to move court, and had once complained against former Haryana DGP Manoj Yadava, accusing him of discrimination.He was last posted as IG-Rohtak Range before being transferred to the training centre on Sept 29. He went on leave and was due to join his new posting on Wednesday.Investigators are struggling to establish a timeline since the basement, which Kumar had converted into his office, was soundproof. So far, they have learnt that Kumar had asked his gunman to give him his service pistol around 1 pm Tuesday, saying he had ""some work to do"", and proceeded to the basement. No one heard the gunshot - not his daughter, the securitymen, house staff, passersby, nor some labourers working at a plot nearby.About an hour later, when Kumar's daughter went to the basement, she found him lying on the sofa, bleeding from the head. She alerted the security personnel and informed the cops. IG Pushpendra Singh, SSP Kaur and SP-city Priyanka rushed to the spot with the first responders. The house was sealed off, and forensic experts collected evidence.

Poll Should the Election Commission provide more transparency in the voter list revision process? Absolutely, transparency is crucial. No, the current process is sufficient.

What’s the identity of add-ons, are they of deleted names or new ones: SC to EC

NEW DELHI: Continued accusations from NGO-petitioners that the Election Commission deleted names from the Bihar voter list after the sp ec ial intensive revision made EC retort in the Supreme Court that all political parties have expressed satisfaction with the exercise and that not a single appeal has been filed against the deletion of names.The bench said, ""There are people living unauthorisedly in the state. They do not want to expose themselves by filing appeals against deletion of their names. Let hundred people file affidavits and tell the court that they want to file an appeal against deletion of their names.""The final Bihar voter list contained 7.4 crore names. SIR saw the deletion of 65 lakh voters in the draft voters list.Subsequently, another 3.7 lakh names were deleted, and 21.5 lakh voters, mostly new ones, were added. The Supreme Court asked EC to provide it with the details of 3.7 lakh excluded voters.With EC counsel Rakesh Dwivedi insisting that the NGO represented by Prashant Bhushan should file affidavits by individuals alleging that their names were deleted without intimation, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi wondered, ""For whom was this exercise undertaken (by the NGO)?""While hearing NGO-petitioners against the special intensive revision of the Bihar electoral rolls on Tuesday, Supreme Court said that since it appears that there is an appreciation of numbers from the draft rolls, to avoid any confusion, the identity of add-ons should be disclosed.“You’d agree with us that the degree of transparency and access has improved in the electoral process. It appears from the data that there was a 65-lakh deletion in the draft list which you published, and we said whoever is dead or moved is all right, but if you are deleting someone, please follow Rule 21 and the SOP.”“We also said that whoever is deleted, please put up their data in your electoral offices. Now the final list appears to be an appreciation of numbers and there is confusion in the general democratic process — what is the identity of the add-ons, are they of deleted names or new names,” Justice Joymalya Bagchi said.With EC counsel Rakesh Dwivedi insisting that the NGO represented by Prashant Bhushan should file affidavits by individuals alleging that their names were deleted without intimation, the bench of Justices Surya Kant and Bagchi wondered, “For whom was this exercise undertaken (by the NGO)?”Senior advocate Maninder Singh recalled petitioner Yogendra Yadav bringing to the courtroom two voters whose names were deleted as dead and said, “EC repeatedly requested the person concerned to give details of the two individuals to enable the commission to carry out necessary corrections. Till date no detail has been given.”The Justice Kant-led bench said, “We also have information about the two voters but do not want to disclose in open court.” While agreeing to hear Yadav for 30 minutes on Thursday, the bench told Bhushan to bring affidavits of people whose names were deleted without being informed about it.EC repudiated this by saying of the 65 lakh deleted names — 22 lakh deceased, 36 lakh permanently shifted and seven lakh enrolled at multiple places — not a single individual has filed an appeal against deletion. Dwivedi said no political party has facilitated a single person since Oct 1, when the final voter list was published, to file an appeal.When Bhushan sought details of the names deleted after SIR, EC said it can be easily verified by the NGO by comparing the Jan 2025 voter list and the final voter list published on Oct 1. Bhushan said it would be a very tedious exercise for the petitioner when the requisite information can be provided within minutes by the EC.When Bhushan continued to object to the way SIR was conducted, the bench said, “We cannot be conducting a roving inquiry into the finalisation of electoral rolls by EC in exercise of its statutory duties. Our aim was to facilitate the poll panel in conducting the exercise smoothly and transparently.”",Ec retort in the supreme court that all political parties have expressed satisfaction with the exercise and that not a single appeal has been filed against the deletion of names.

4,078 Days As PM: Modi Tops Indira Gandhi, Now Behind Jawaharlal Nehru In India's Longest PM Streaks

NEW DELHI: On a day that marked the beginning of his 25th continuous year on a constitutional post - he first took office as Gujarat CM in 2001 - PM Narendra Modi emphasised his resolve to work even harder towards realising ""country's collective dream of a Viksit Bharat"".""Thanks to the continuous blessings of my fellow Indians, I am entering my 25th year of serving as the head of a government. Through all these years, it has been my constant endeavour to improve lives of our people and contribute to the progress of this great nation that has nurtured us all,"" the PM remarked, posting a series of messages on X Tuesday.Reflecting on his journey - 11 years as PM and 13 years as Gujarat CM - Modi recalled the formidable challenges he had encountered as Gujarat's CM. He drew parallels with the hurdles he faced on becoming PM in 2014, when the nation was grappling with a profound ""crisis of trust and governance"".""Over past 11 years, we the people of India have worked together and achieved many transformations. Our path-breaking efforts have empowered citizens from all corners of the country, especially Nari Shakti, Yuva Shakti, and hardworking Annadatas. Over 25 crore people have been lifted from the clutches of poverty,"" Modi said.Turning to his Gujarat tenure, he evoked the dire circumstances of his appointment: the state was reeling from the impact of an earthquake, compounded by a super cyclone, successive droughts and political turmoil. ""Those challenges only strengthened my resolve to serve the people and rebuild Gujarat with renewed vigour and hope,"" he shared.Modi recalled, ""When I took oath as CM, I remember my mother telling me: '...I seek two things. You will always work for the poor; second, never take a bribe'.""Lauding his achievements, home minister Amit Shah said the ""Karma Yogi"" PM exemplified how ""Nation First"" and ""Developed India"" vision can catalyse transformation in the lives of crores.When Modi was sworn in as Gujarat 14th CM on Oct 7, 2001, he had never contested an election before. That didn't stop him from giving a new direction and impetus to Gujarat's development journey.","Narendra modi marks 25th continuous year on a constitutional post.

'Every Time There's An Election...': TMC MP Mahua Moitra Exposes BJP's 'Hindu-Muslim Danga' Strategy

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to examine a plea to lodge an FIR against hate speech for a video being circulated by Assam BJP in support of its claim that Muslims would take over the state if BJP goes out of office.The application has been filed by former Patna high court judge Anjana Prakash and journalist Qurban Ali who alleged that the video ""targets, vilifies and demonises Muslims"".Appearing for petitioners before a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta, advocate Nizam Pasha, submitted that though the offensive video uploaded on 'X' targeted one community in violation of apex court's order, no action has been taken.He also pleaded the court to pass directions for the video to be taken off social media and direct lodging of an FIR.The bench, after a brief hearing, issued notice and posted the case for further hearing to October 28.""The video has been circulated by the BJP Assam Unit on Sept 15 on its official X handle viz. ""BJP Assam Pradesh"" showing a grossly false narrative that depicts the takeover of Assam by Muslims if the BJP doesn't remain in power in Assam.The video depicts the consequences of a change in the present ruling dispensation and inter alia shows visibly Muslim people (wearing skull caps and burqas) taking over tea estates, Guhawati airport, Guhawati Accolad, Assam Ranghar, Guhawati Stadium, Guhawati Town,"" the petition said.They pleaded that the video should be be taken down immediately to contain any further spread of communal disharmony, unrest and enmity.""It is submitted that the aforementioned video shows the gross failure as well as the complete disregard of secular values that the ruling dispensation of any State of our country is bound to uphold. It is further submitted that a state government, elected and formed under the Constitution of India, is the guardian of all communities and is specifically prohibited by the Constitution from engaging in discrimination inter alia on the basis of religion, race, caste, gender, language. Thus, the burden of being fair, just and secular is far greater on an elected govt. In this regard it is pertinent to note that even private citizens are prohibited under law from making communal speeches or spreading communal disharmony,"" the application said.They said the ruling dispensation of Assam is bound by the Constitution and thereby is bound to uphold the secular values that form part of the basic structure of the Constitution. Terming hate speech as a ""serious offence"" which could affect the secular fabric of the country, the Supreme Court in 2023 had directed police in all states and UTs to take suo motu action and register cases against those making such speeches irrespective of their religion without waiting for a formal complaint.","Supreme court agrees to examine a plea to lodge an fir against hate speech for a video being circulated by assam bjp.

SBI’s fraud tag on Anil & RCom has no infirmity: HC

MUMBAI: Bombay high court has said it’s evident that once a company account is declared as fraud, the promoter or directors in control of affairs would automatically be liable to penal measures, reported as fraud and debarred from raising funds or seeking credit facilities, as they were responsible for the acts or omissions of the company.The high court said so while dismissing Anil Ambani ’s challenge to an SBI order that termed Reliance Communications ’ (RCom’s) loan account as “fraud” and reported his name to Reserve Bank of India under fraud detection guidelines.For Anil Ambani , senior counsel Darius Khambata said despite the fact that there were no allegations against Ambani in a show-cause notice of December 2023, and he was not a whole-time director of the company, his name was reported.HC said the law was well settled and there was no need to spell out specific allegations against the promoter and director having control over the company, which, in this case, Ambani had during the relevant period. Ambani’s defence argued principles of natural justice were flouted as he was given no personal hearing before his name was reported too, and also similar orders against other non-executive directors were dropped.The HC, in a reasoned judgment available Tuesday, said “the role of the other directors, who were exonerated, was different and distinct from that of the present petitioner, inasmuch as they were non-executive directors and were not responsible for the day-to-day functioning of RCOM.”SBI had said it reported Ambani’s name under terms of Master Directions on Fraud Risk Management in Commercial Banks and All India Financial Institutions dated 15 July 2024.An HC division bench on October 3 found the SBI order to be a reasoned one sans any infirmity and Ambani’s petition challenging it with “no merit” and dismissed it.HC said the show cause notice detailed the basis of the declaration of fraud as contemplated by SBI. It said the erstwhile non-executive director failed to reply and continued to seek documents, leading to SBI finally proceeding to pass the order.HC said principles of natural justice don’t have a straitjacket formula, but so long as Ambani was “afforded an adequate opportunity to submit his objections in writing, the requirement of fairness and compliance with the principle of natural justice stood satisfied.”","Bombay high court said it’s evident that once a company account is declared as fraud, the promoter or directors in control of affairs would automatically be liable to penal measures.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah on Tuesday announced a holiday for government and government-aided schools from October 8 to October 18 to allow teachers involved in the ongoing social and educational survey, known as the 'caste survey', to complete their work.The survey was originally scheduled to end on October 7. However, progress has been uneven across districts, prompting the government to extend the deadline by 10 days.""We were supposed to end the survey on October 7. But in some districts, the survey is almost completed, while in some districts it was lagging,"" Siddaramaiah told reporters after a meeting with ministers and officials.Also read: Karnataka: Ministers clash over Lingayat issue

Teachers engaged in mid-term examinations will be exempt from the survey.Earlier in the day, the Karnataka CM said he had no position on the Lingayat community’s demand for separate religious status, even as the opposition BJP accused him of trying to divide Hindu religion and society.","Karnataka chief minister siddaramaiah announced a holiday for government and government-aided schools from october 8 to october 18.

Poll Do you think the safety measures on flights are adequate? Yes No

NEW DELHI: The ram air turbine (RAT) of an Air India Dreamliner deployed on its final approach, seconds before landing at 400 feet, to Birmingham on Saturday. The aircraft landed safely and has been grounded for checks. The RAT - a last-resort emergency power system - was deployed seconds after the ill-fated Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner lifted off from Ahmedabad on June 12.While the Boeing 787 was released for service by Sunday evening (India time), the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) says “requires detailed investigation” which has been assigned to a senior air safety official. At the time of filing this story, Air India was evaluating whether to operate the about 12-year-old VT-ANO back to India as a scheduled or a ferry (without passengers) flight.RAT - a last-resort emergency power system - was deployed seconds after the ill-fated Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner lifted off from Ahmedabad on June 12. Hence its deployment created a flutter on Saturday when the deployment happened on yet another AI B787-8 Dreamliner.In a statement, Air India said: “The operating crew of flight AI117 from Amritsar to Birmingham on Oct 4, 2025, detected deployment of the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) of the aircraft during its final approach.All electrical and hydraulic parameters were found normal, and the aircraft performed a safe landing at Birmingham. The aircraft has been grounded for further checks and consequently, AI114 from Birmingham to Delhi has been cancelled and alternative arrangements are being made to accommodate the guests. At Air India, the safety of passengers and crew remains top priority.”AI 117 had taken off from Amritsar at 12.52 pm on Oct 4. “During landing at 400 feet, RAT unlock message came and RAT got deployed. Pilots did not report any related abnormality. The aircraft landed safely (at Birmingham 7.07 pm, all local timings),” said a senior official, adding, “Boeing has issued a ‘fleet team digest’ containing brief of previous such cases.”According to aviation website Skybrary: “RAT is a small turbine that is installed in an aircraft and used as an alternate or emergency hydraulic or electrical power source. (It) generates power from the airstream based on the speed of the aircraft and is connected to an electrical generator or to a hydraulic pump.”“In general, modern aircraft only utilise RAT in emergency: either in the event of loss of hydraulic systems or following the loss of primary electrical generation. In these cases the RAT will power vital systems such as flight controls or flight-critical instrumentation, navigation and communication equipment. Some RATs produce only hydraulic power which in turn is used to power an electrical generator,” Skybrary adds.","The ram air turbine (rat) of an air india dreamliner deployed on its final approach, seconds before landing at 400 feet.
