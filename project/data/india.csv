Uniform opportunity to become district judges: SC reserves verdict; direct recruits oppose quota for promotional cadre judicial officers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uniform-opportunity-to-become-district-judges-sc-reserves-verdict-direct-recruits-oppose-quota-for-promotional-cadre-judicial-officers/articleshow/125100301.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday reserved a verdict on an issue sensitive to 20,000-odd judicial officers and will decide whether those opting for the promotional route to become district judges need a quota to counter lawyers, directly recruited to the DJ post, from stealing a march over them.While the High Courts have cited constitutional mandate to request the SC to refrain from interfering in the framing of service and promotion rules and conditions, the promotional cadre of judicial officers pitched for a quota complaining that those who start their careers as judicial magistrates seldom reach the post of Principal District Judge (PDJ).The promotional cadre also told a bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai, CJI-designate Surya Kant and Justices Vikram Nath, K Vinod Chandran and Joymalya Bagchi that while a 35-year-old lawyer with seven years practice can clear a competitive examination to become district judge, the career judicial officers become district judges at an age that varies between 45-52 years in different states.But the direct recruit district judge cadre officers through several senior advocates said that there are three sources of filling DJ posts – promotion (50% of posts), direct recruitment (25%) and through limited departmental competitive examination (25%). The promotional cadre officers outnumber the directly recruited DJs by three to one and the existing ROTA-Quota system has worked well and does not need tweaking by introducing quota for promotional cadre, they said.CJI Gavai said, “In some states direct recruit DJs are in an advantageous position, while promotional cadres enjoy advantage in some other states. SO, is it not necessary that there should be a uniform promotional avenue for judicial officers to DJ post irrespective of their source of recruitment?”When some counsel apprehended that tweaking the system would fuel the existing rivalry between promotional cadre and direct recruits, the bench said, “We are only examining the issue of giving a fair opportunity to each judicial officer irrespective of their source of recruitment. The intention is to improve the efficiency of the justice delivery system.”A counsel pointed out that not even one among the present 34 SC judges have come from the promotional cadre of judicial officers, the CJI-led bench said there have been many instances in the past when judicial officers through promotion to DJ, got selected as HC Judges and then elevated as SC judges, including two CJIs.“We do not perceive it as a fight between promotional cadres and direct recruit judicial officers. This exercise is for improving the efficiency of the system of administration of justice. It is a trial-and-error method. The mechanism had been tweaked in the past. Whatever we may decide in this case may be revisited by the SC a few years later,” the bench said.",The high courts have cited constitutional mandate to request the sc to refrain from interfering in the framing of service and promotion rules and conditions.

Attempts to revolutionise travel by road discernible says SC; focus on infra development seen a quantum leap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/attempts-to-revolutionise-travel-by-road-discernible-says-sc-focus-on-infra-development-seen-a-quantum-leap/articleshow/125100066.cms,"NEW DELHI: In what could make the Union govt, especially road transport and highway minister Nitin Gadkari, proud, the Supreme Court on Tuesday commended the country’s quantum leap in infrastructure development and digitisation and said attempts to revolutionise travel by road through world-class highways are discernible.While frowning at the inability of the Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh state road transport corporations to reach an agreement on inter-state bus routes causing discomfort to people, a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and A G Masih said India has developed in this century as an intricate network of highways connect remote villages to the cities and towns.Writing the judgment, Justice Datta said, “Expressways have been constructed to facilitate faster movement of people and goods between distant locations and thereby reduce travel time. These highways and expressways are transforming India’s transportation landscape and driving economic growth, among others.”What could remind old-timers about then Lok Sabha member Lalu Prasad Yadav’s infamous statement promising to construct highways as smooth as an actor’s cheek, the bench said, “What deserves special note is that the surface of these highways/expressways is smoother than ever before.With the introduction of modern vehicles, operators of stage carriage services have been providing comfort and convenience which are comparable with services available abroad. ”“Switch to electric vehicles for both public and private use has facilitated sustainable transportation. A feature of smart transportation has been integration of technology to enhance efficiency and safety. In fine, with continued innovation and investment, the road transport sector seems to have progressed to attain more efficiency, sustainability and accessibility,” it said.SC said digitisation has been a game-changer and a couple of state road transport corporations have made use of all these IT and infrastructure developments to earn profits. “To adapt to the changing transportation landscape, leveraging technology to improve services and customer experience is the priority for these corporations,” it said.After the praise for the infrastructure development, the SC said the SRTCs of UP and MP have not paid adequate heed to interest of passengers and commuters and asked the two state-run bodies to enter dialogue for commencing playing of buses on inter-state routes.The SC said the principal secretaries of the transport departments of the two states could meet and work out an Inter-State Reciprocal Transport Agreement within three months to enable private operators to ply buses on routes allotted to MPSRTC, which is on the verge of being wound up.",Justices dipankar datta and a g masih said india has developed in this century as an intricate network of highways connect remote villages to the cities and towns.

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act being invoked in cases of consenting adolescent romantic relations, Supreme Court said on Tuesday there was a need to spread awareness among students about the issue and hinted that it would pass directions.""The Pocso Act is being misused in cases of marital discord and matters pertaining to consensual relationships between adolescents. The law is being thrust upon boys.

""Schools should make students aware about anti-rape laws at a young age so that they understand the consequences of committing such offences, including different kinds of rape as per the amended definition under Section 375 IPC,"" it further added.SC has repeatedly highlighted the problem of consenting adolescent romantic relations being criminalised. Last week, the court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution and acquitted a man charged under the Pocso Act after noting that the couple was happily married.

During this period, the man repeatedly raped the girl while the mother allegedly abetted the abuse. The girl was allegedly forced to drink alcohol.

Drones are typically used for commercial, industrial, or surveillance purposes, while aeromodelling is a recreational and educational activity that has ""inspired generations of pilots, aircraft engineers, and aviation professionals. ""The present draft of the Drone Bill is overly restrictive and, if implemented as is, will effectively end aeromodelling in India, the association said. It argued that the proposed framework - which mandates registration, licensing, type certification, and flight permissions - is unsuitable for non-autonomous, manually flown model aircraft that pose minimal risk.Under the draft law, no person may own or operate any unmanned aircraft without registration and a unique identification number (UIN).Violation can attract fines up to Rs1 lakh or imprisonment up to one year. The bill also makes violations of restricted airspace rules ""cognisable and non-compoundable,"" punishable by imprisonment up to three years or fines up to Rs1 lakh.""Aeromodelling is a low-risk, high learning activity...,"" the letter said. Almost all of their members design, build, and fly their own model aircraft-not multi-rotor drones.

Ismail was doing wholesale clothing business. The driver has been arrested.They are survived by two daughters and a son, who study in classes 2, 5, and 7. The injured — Mohammed Riyan, 29, a private firm employee, and his pillion rider, Mohammed Siddiq, 32, a mechanic — were from Someshwaranagar in Jayanagar.At the time of the accident, the ambulance, which was not carrying any patients, was heading towards Lalbagh, while the victims were on their way to Wilson Garden from Urvashi Theatre Junction through H Siddaiah Road.At the junction, the ambulance had a cross-direction collision with the two scooters.

BENGALURU: ""I killed my wife for you."" Dr Mahendra Reddy GS, main accused in the murder of his dermatologist-wife Kruthila Reddy, sent out this cryptic and loaded message to at least 4-5 women, including a medical professional who had spurned his proposal, weeks after his wife's death.In a desperate bid to give marriage a second start, Mahendra got in touch with women, who had earlier dumped him, and came back from the dead to make renewed proposals to half-a-dozen women.According to police, Mahendra administered anaesthesia and killed his wife Kruthika, 29, on April 24. He was arrested on Oct 14 from Manipal, Udupi district, for his wife's death.Police said Mahendra had messaged ‘I killed my wife for you' to the medical professional — not a doctor — through a digital-payment app after she had blocked him on multiple messaging platforms.Police have seized his mobile phone and laptop and sent them to a forensic science laboratory. The data revealed his messages to the woman.Deputy commissioner of police (Whitefield) K Parashurama confirmed the messages were sent through PhonePe, a digital-payment app. The woman's statement has been recorded, but police are not revealing any details due to the ongoing investigation.The woman reportedly told police that she had blocked Mahendra before his marriage.After learning about his marriage to Kruthika, the woman stayed away from him. However, he messaged ‘a confession' to her a couple of months after killing his wife. Until Mahendra was arrested on murder charges, the woman had assumed he was falsely confessing to the murder only with an intention to talk to her, a senior police officer said, adding the woman has no role in the crime.Investigating officers found that Mahendra was also in contact with a Mumbai-based woman until 2023. He proposed to marry her and met her a few times. Later, he made his father call and inform her that he had ""died in an accident"". After that, he was not in contact with her.However, Mahendra rose from the ashes and called her in Sept to confirm he was not dead. Instead, according to his astrological chart, his first wife was going to die. Since his ""love for her was genuine"", he told her that he had lied to her and got married to Kruthika. As his wife was dead now, he said that he wanted to marry her.","Dr mahendra reddy gs, main accused in the murder of his dermatologist-wife kruthila reddy, sent out this cryptic and loaded message to at least 4-5 women, including a medical professional.

In his hate for PM Modi, he has already crossed the line into hating India.""Another BJP spokesperson, Sanju Verma, also hit out at Rahul Gandhi over his remarks, saying, “Rahul Gandhi is shamelessly devious and deviously shameless.Listening to him in this clip leaves no doubt that this failed, forever-in-waiting PM is desperately trying to polarize. Now he is trying to divide the Army on caste lines — what an unhinged wreck this Leader of Opposition is. Disgraceful.”Directing his attack to Bihar government, Rahul painted a picture of unemployment in the state, blaming the Nitish Kumar government for pushing its youth into low-paying, menial labour across the country.""The people of Bihar are doing manual labour across the entire country. In different parts of the country, people from Bihar are building large buildings, roads, tunnels, and factories,"" he said.Accusing the state government of failing its people, Rahul added, ""In other words, the truth is this—that Nitish Kumar has wiped out employment here and turned the people of Bihar into the country’s labourers.""","Lok sabha leader of opposition rahul gandhi made a striking claim in bihar.

Watch: Pappu Yadav Gets Angry When Asked Why He Wasn’t Seen with Rahul Gandhi

AURANGABAD: Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi stirred controversy Tuesday by claiming ""10% of the country's population"" controls the Army, comments seen as an allusion to upper castes. ""...Only 10% of the country's population get opportunities in corporate sectors, bureaucracy, and judiciary. .. even the Army is under their control. The remaining 90% - backward classes, Dalits, STs, and minorities - are nowhere to be seen,"" Rahul said while campaigning in Bihar's Aurangabad and Kutumba ahead of the first phase of assembly polls on Thursday.The comments echoed calls by Congress's Rahul and other opposition parties over the past year for a national caste census but this was the first time he had referred to the Army while highlighting such demands.Rahul asserted that such a census would identify ""the 90% Indians sitting outside the system"" and help protect their rights and constitutional guarantees. ""If 90% people don't have participatory rights, the Constitution can't be protected. We want the data. How many Dalits, OBCs, women, minorities... are there. We are trying to protect the Constitution through this demand for a caste census,"" Rahul said.Rahul has made controversial comments about the Army earlier, drawing legal censure.He was rapped by Supreme Court in Aug for claiming during his 'Bharat Jodo Yatra' over two years ago that ""Chinese troops are thrashing Indian soldiers in Arunachal Pradesh"". The comment was made in reference to the face-off with China in Arunachal's Tawang in Dec 2022. Earlier in May, Allahabad HC had rejected a plea by Rahul challenging summons in a case, saying freedom of speech didn't include the right to ""defame"" the Army. On Bihar poll trail Tuesday, Rahul lashed out at what he described as PM Narendra Modi's ""digital distractions"" as he accused Centre of using social media to divert youths from the real issues of unemployment and inequality.""They gave cheap data instead of jobs. They told youth to make reels instead of asking questions. Watching and making reels has become an addiction - a distraction to keep young people silent. The money goes to industrialists. Youths are left with entertainment as a drug,"" Rahul said.He accused CM Nitish Kumar of having ""reduced Bihar's youth to becoming nation's labourers"", saying the CM had failed to create opportunities for the young. ""Bihar, once home to the world-renowned Nalanda University, has now been reduced to a land where young people are forced to migrate across India for menial work. Nitish has made the sons of this soil labourers, not builders of Bihar's future,"" Rahul said.","Lok sabha leader of opposition rahul gandhi stirs controversy by claiming ""10% of the country's population"" controls the army.

Lakhpati Didi Scheme: PM Modi Empowers Over 20 Lakh Women in Bihar with Cash Support Ahead of Polls

NEW DELHI: Direct cash transfers to women have become the norm across states, with 12 now offering them, up from two in 2022-23. This year, the states are cumulatively projected to spend Rs 1,68,050 crore, or 0.5% of GDP, on unconditional cash transfers to women, a study by PRS Legislative Research has said. Just two years ago, the figure was less than 0.2% of GDP.Be it Gruh Lakshmi in Karnataka, Ladli Behna in MP, Ladki Behin in Maharashtra or Mukhyamantri Mahila Rozgar Yojana in Bihar, parties across the political spectrum have been using cash transfers to women as a way to quickly reach out to voters ahead of polls. The beneficiaries are clearly happy, although the state exchequer feels the strain of such bounties.Assam and West Bengal, where assembly elections are due next year, have increased allocation for these schemes. Compared to the revised estimates for the last financial year, Assam has increased the outlay by 31%, while the rise in Bengal is 15%. In Oct 2024, Jharkhand increased the monthly payout under the CM Maiyan Samman Yojana from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,500.Parties often have to roll back some of them as state finances do not give them headroom to spend. For instance, the report said, in April, Maharashtra reduced the monthly benefit under CM Ladki Bahin Yojana from Rs 1,500 to Rs 500 for women receiving Rs 1,000 under another direct benefit transfer scheme for farmers.A trend that started with cash transfers to farmers in Odisha has since been expanded. RBI has already cautioned states on the rising spend on subsidies, farm loan waivers and cash transfers. The PRS report says, ""Among the 12 states implementing unconditional cash transfer schemes, six have estimated a revenue deficit in 2025-26. However, adjusting the revenue balance to exclude spending on UCT schemes shows an improvement in fiscal indicators of these states. That is, all other things remaining constant, these cash transfers result in Karnataka moving from a revenue surplus of 0.3% of GSDP to a revenue deficit of 0.6% of GSDP. Similarly, these transfers reduce Madhya Pradesh's revenue surplus from 1.1% of GSDP to a marginal 0.4% of GSDP.""","This year, states are projected to spend rs 1,68,050 crore on unconditional cash transfers to women. Just two years ago, the figure was less than 0.2% of gdp.

The additional chief secretary of home had told the court that the goof-up was caused by a clerk's ""typographical mistake"" and that the employee received a show-cause notice for it.","A bureaucratic bungle led a young man named in a private dispute to be charged under the stringent national security act.

VIP counts on consolidation in the end

A peculiar contest has emerged in Darbhanga’s Gaura Bauram constituency. Amid uncertainty and confusion during seat-sharing within the Mahagathbandhan, RJD had initially allotted the ticket to Afzal Ali Khan. Later, the seat was handed over to Mukesh Sahni’s VIP. Sahni then fielded his younger brother Santosh Sahni from here but Afzal Ali refused to withdraw. Treating this as indiscipline, RJD yesterday expelled Afzal Ali for six years with immediate effect.This sets up a potential split in the Muslim vote between Afzal Ali and Santosh Sahni, this could end up benefiting the BJP.BJP has fielded former IRS officer Sujeet Kumar Singh. His wife Swarna Singh had won from here in the previous election on VIP’s ticket, but later joined BJP. The seat has a sizeable Mallah population, the reason Mukesh Sahni had originally demanded it for himself but eventually nominated his younger brother.RJD insists that Santosh Sahni is the authorised Mahagathbandhan candidate. But on paper, Afzal Ali continues to remain the nominated nominee — something that could complicate Santosh’s prospects. Afzal Ali had lost by barely 7,000 votes the last time when he contested on RJD’s ticket.2.65 lakhMuslim 70k, Yadav 28k, Mallah 26k, Brahmin 33k, Vaishya 20k, Paswan 15k, other SC 25k.BJP’s Sujeet Kumar Singh is from the Rajput community, which is not numerically dominant here. However, he believes he can ride on the BJP’s core vote base plus Mahagathbandhan’s internal rebellion.Speaking to us, he claimed that barring Muslims, every caste group is voting for me. He also claimed a large chunk of Yadavs are backing him. Singh resigned from the IRS only a week before receiving the BJP ticket and believes his “education and clean image” will work as an added advantage.VIP spokesperson Dev Jyoti said within 24 hours of Afzal Ali’s expulsion, the “wind has swung” in VIP’s favour. He expressed confidence that Muslim voters, at the end of the day, will back the candidate best placed to defeat the BJP. He also said the backing of Lalu Prasad Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav is firmly with VIP here.However, some minority voters argue that since RJD had already issued the nomination earlier, Mukesh Sahni shouldn’t have disturbed the seat.","Bjp has fielded former irs officer sujeet kumar singh.

PATNA: Heat and dust of cheek-by-jowl rallies fused with war of words on social media as campaigning ended Tuesday for the first phase of Bihar polls on Nov 6 in 121 of its 243 assembly seats. More than 3.75 crore electors are expected to cast their votes at 45,341 polling stations to decide the fate of 1,314 candidates.As campaigning concluded at 6pm, governing NDA and INDIA bloc-led opposition left no stone unturned to reach out to voters. Union minister Amit Shah addressed three rallies, defence minister Rajnath Singh five, BJP president JP Nadda two and leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi three. PM Narendra Modi interacted with state BJP women workers virtually, and CM Nitish Kumar addressed meetings, as did INDIA bloc's CM face Tejashwi Yadav of RJD. Adding to BJP's blitz, Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, UP CM Yogi Adityanath, Delhi CM Rekha Gupta and former Union minister Smriti Irani joined the campaign.Prominent seats in this phase include Raghopur, where Tejashwi is hoping for a hat-trick; Mahua, where Tejashwi's elder brother and ex-minister Tej Pratap Yadav is trying his luck with a new outfit; & Tarapur, from where deputy CM Samrat Choudhary of BJP is in the fray.Other key seats are Alinagar, where singer Maithili Thakur is the BJP nominee. In Lakhisarai, another deputy CM, Vijay Kumar Sinha, is trying to save his fort. Mokama has in the fray Anant Kumar Singh of JDU, a don-turned-politician recently jailed over the murder of Jan Suraaj supporter Dular Chand Yadav.Chhapra has a dramatic duel too, with RJD fielding Bhojpuri film star Khesari Lal Yadav against Chhoti Kumari of the BJP, who has won the seat three times earlier.Away from the raucous roadshows and rallies, the campaign is also being waged from silent ""war rooms"" - social media hubs set up by parties to reach out to voters, especially youths and Gen Z. Operating 24x7, these hubs are the unsung architects of electoral fortunes, blending AI-driven voter profiling with old-school booth management.BJP's war room is led by Rohan Gupta, a seasoned strategist from BJP's national IT cell.

The petitioners argued that under Muslim personal law, a man is entitled to have up to four wives at a time.HC held that the registrar shall not register a second marriage if the first wife objected on the grounds that it was invalid. Instead, the parties must be referred to the competent civil court to establish the validity of the marriage.Even under Muslim personal law, a man may marry a second time only under specific conditions, HC observed. It noted that neither the Holy Quran nor Muslim law permitted a man to have an extramarital relationship or to contract another marriage without the knowledge of his first wife. HC noted that a Muslim wife could not remain a silent spectator. ""In such matters, religion is secondary and constitutional rights are supreme,"" HC said, adding that ""99.99% of Muslim women will be against their husband's second marriage when their marital relationship is still in existence. ""HC also held that under Muslim personal law, a man may marry more than one wife only if he has the means to maintain them.
