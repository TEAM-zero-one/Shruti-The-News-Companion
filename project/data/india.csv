SC refuses to test validity of state laws against cow trafficking and slaughter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-refuses-to-test-validity-of-state-laws-against-cow-trafficking-and-slaughter/articleshow/118161110.cms,"Supreme court

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to entertain a PIL, which alleged spiraling incidents of violence against Muslims by cow vigilante groups, saying it has already laid down mandatory guidelines for police to act against incidents of mob-lynching and that aggrieved persons must move jurisdictional High Courts for relief.“Sitting in Delhi we cannot monitor incidents happening in different areas of various states of the country. Such micromanagement is not feasible,” said a bench of Justices B R Gavai and K Vinod Chandran.However, it said that infraction of the guidelines to deal with incidents of mob-lynching laid down in the 2018 judgment in Tehseen Poonawalla case , which is bound to be implemented in letter and spirit by police and all other concerned authorities, then the aggrieved parties can move the concerned HCs seeking redressal of their grievances.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the Bhartiya Nyaya Samhita has incorporated mob-lynching as a specific offence and it is the responsibility of the states to implement the criminal laws. “For every incident happening in the nook and corner of the country, a Pil cannot be filed directly in the Supreme Court bypassing the jurisdictional HCs,” he said.Appearing for petitioner National Federation of Indian Women, the women’s wing of CPI, advocate Nizamuddin Pasha told the bench that after the petitioner pointe out large number of incidents of cow vigilante groups targeting Muslims and the police registering cases against Muslims and not against those who indulged in violence, the court had sought affidavits from all states. The responses show non-implementation of Tehseen Poonawala guidelines.The bench turned to the other plea of the petitioner demanding minimum uniform compensation for victims of mob-lynching. It refused to do so saying the compensation cannot be the same for those suffering minor and grievous injuries. Fixing a minimum uniform compensation would take away the discretion of the courts and authorities to provide adequate amounts to victims, it said.The petitioner had also challenged provisions in laws enacted by 13 states which authorize even private persons to inspect premises on the suspicion of it being used for cow slaughter or cattle smuggling. It said statutory duties cannot be delegated to private people.However, the bench said each statutory provision must be tested individually and that the SC cannot enter an exercise for generic testing of validity of all these laws. Those aggrieved by the provisions these laws would have to move concerned state HC to challenge their validity.",Supreme court refuses to entertain a pil alleging spiraling incidents of violence against muslims by cow vigilante groups.

NEW DELHI: The massive uproar over content creator Ranveer Allahbadia 's ""sex and parents"" remark at comedian Samay Raina 's "" India's Got Latent "" show only intensified on Tuesday, with people across the spectrum stepping in to condemn Allahbadia's crass comment.Allahbadia, widely popular for his YouTube channel ""BeerBiceps,"" landed trouble after a clip of him from Samay Raina's show went viral. What began as backlash from netizens quickly escalated into a national debate, drawing criticism from political leaders, a body for women's rights and other public figures.Hours after facing criticism on social media on Monday, Allahbadia issued an apology but the matter did not subside. Shiv Sena MP Naresh Mhaske on Tuesday raised the matter in Parliament during Zero Hour, calling for a law to regulate social media. He said there was a need to enact a law to regulate social media platforms where influencers are posting ""all kinds of nonsense"" in the name of freedom of speech .""The inappropriate things they said yesterday should be censored. There should be censorship on influencers' content, and today I also raised this issue in Parliament, suggesting that action should be taken against them.

No, it's just political talk Yes, it seems likely

NEW DELHI: Is Arvind Kejriwal , who suffered a humiliating defeat in the just-concluded Delhi assembly elections, planning a rejig in Punjab? Well, both the BJP and the Congress claim that the incumbent Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann is under pressure after the party's Delhi debacle.BJP leader and Union Minister Ravneet Singh Bittu on Tuesday took digs at Bhagwant Mann after the Punjab chief minister and his 91 MLAs met AAP chief Kejriwal in the national capital. ""A meeting was called to change the chief minister, but today’s media frames tell a different story. Have you ever seen Bhagwant Mann with his cabinet ministers? He used to speak alone in front of the media. For three years, no minister was ever seen with him in any media frame, but today, there was a large gathering with ministers standing proudly. This photo reveals what’s happening within the Aam Aadmi Party in Punjab,"" Bittu said.BJP's newly-elected MLA from West Delhi's Rajouri Garden, Manjinder Singh Sirsa also took a dig at Kejriwal for holding a meeting with Punjab MLAs despite AAP's defeat in Delhi. ""He is dreaming of becoming Punjab chief minister. Just like a fish out of water, Kejriwal can not live without power and luxury,"" Sirsa said. ""The people of Punjab are self-respecting and have mellowed the arrogance of many, so, Kejriwal should stop dreaming about becoming Punjab's CM,"" he added.The Congress also targeted Kejriwal and claimed that the AAP government in Punjab may soon see a change. Congress MP Gurjit Singh Aujla wondered why Punjab MLAs were called for meeting after a loss in Delhi.""He has lost Delhi, so he should call Delhi leaders and brainstorm, but Punjab MLAs have been called. Both his models, Punjab and Delhi, have failed. Arvind Kejriwal wants to become the chief minister or wants some changes. The people of Punjab are fed up with him, no matter how many meetings he holds, it will not make any difference,"" Congress MP Gurjit Singh Aujla said.Congress MP Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa claimed that the meeting shortly after the elections only showed that AAP would break soon. ""The results were declared on February 8 and the movement has already started. Calling a meeting so soon shows that they will break soon. There will be mid-term polls in Punjab. When a party loses, there is a discussion within the state, other states are not called. They are worried that what happened in Delhi may be repeated in Punjab,"" Singh said.Kejriwal's meeting with Punjab MLAs took place amid rumours of dissent within the state unit of the party.Bhagwant Mann, speaking to reporters after his meeting with Kejriwal, dismissed speculation about dissent within AAP's state unit, asserting that Congress leaders have a history of switching parties while AAP leaders remain dedicated. Mann's remarks came after Punjab Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa claimed that over 30 AAP MLAs were in touch with his party.""Switching sides is Congress' culture; they talk about others but do not worry about themselves. I will ask Pratap Singh Bajwa how many MLAs they have in Delhi."" Mann said.""Bajwa has made such claims for years, let him say it ... He should not count our MLAs and instead, see how many MLAs Congress has in Delhi,"" he said.After losing Delhi, AAP has government only in Punjab. There are speculations that Kejriwal may play a bigger role in Punjab politics. AAP leaders have dismissed such reports.AAP, which ruled Delhi for a decade, suffered a major setback in the February 5 elections, losing 40 seats and its government in the national capital. The AAP could win only 22 seats in the 70-member assembly, while the BJP with 48 seats is all set to form its government in Delhi.Assembly elections are due in Punjab in about two years time in 2027. AAP, which had won 92 seats and decimated the Congress to come to power in the state, faces a stiff challenge in the state after losing Delhi.(With inputs from agencies)",Bjp leader ravneet singh bittu took digs at bhagwant mann after the punjab chief minister and his 91 mlas met arvind kejriwal.

Poll Should Paper Trails Be Used More In Elections? No, EVMs Are Enough Yes, Adds Accountability

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday sought the Election Commission of India 's (ECI) response to the pleas seeking verification of the burnt memory and symbol loading units in Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in compliance with its judgement.A special bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Dipankar Datta asked the poll panel to avoid erasing or reloading data during the verification process.The pleas sought a direction to the ECI to check and verify burnt memory/micro-controllers and the symbol loading unit (SLU) of the EVMs.The SC bench asked the poll panel to file its response within 15 days and explain the procedure adopted and posted the matter in the week commencing March 3.NGO Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), in a new plea, had argued that the Election Commission’s standard operating procedure for EVM verification did not align with the court's ruling in the EVM-VVPAT case .In its April 26, 2024, judgment, the top court had dismissed the demand for a return to paper ballots, affirming that EVMs were secure and had helped eliminate booth capturing and fraudulent voting.However, the ruling provided an opportunity for candidates who finished second or third in the elections to request verification of micro-controller chips in 5 per cent of EVMs per assembly constituency.This verification could be sought through a written request and by paying a prescribed fee to the Election Commission of India.On Tuesday, the bench sought clarification from the Election Commission regarding the erasure and reloading of polling data.It emphasized that the court’s ruling did not require such measures but only called for verification of EVMs by an engineer from the manufacturing company.""What we intended was that, if after the polls somebody asks, the engineer should come and certify that, according to him, in their presence, there is no tampering in any of the burnt memory or microchips. That's all. Why do you erase the data?"" asked the CJI, according to news agency PTI.""We didn't want such a detailed process that you reload something. Do not erase the data, do not reload the data - all you need to do is have someone verify and examine,"" he further said.The top court also refused to entertain a fresh petition from former Haryana minister and five-time MLA Karan Singh Dalal, expressing displeasure over the concealment of details regarding a similar plea that had been withdrawn earlier.The court also directed that, starting May 1, 2024, the symbol loading units be sealed in a container and stored alongside EVMs in a strongroom for at least 45 days after the election results were declared.The bench also raised concerns over the cost of verification set by the EC after being informed that Rs 40,000 was charged for verifying one EVM.""Reduce the cost of 40,000 - that's too high,"" it said.Seeking the poll panel's response, the bench recorded its assurance that no modification or correction of EVM data would take place during the verification process.""Mr Singh (ECI counsel) states that they will clarify the position by filing a short affidavit explaining the procedure adopted by them. He also states they won't be doing any modification/correction of the data,"" it said.",The supreme court on tuesday sought the election commission of india's response to the pleas seeking verification of the burnt memory and symbol loading units in electronic voting machines.

As these were initially suspected to be hooch-related deaths, the probe was intensified. An eyewitness told police that he saw Chauhan drinking from a bottle of jeera soda and offering it to others.

These will be sent for forensic tests to check for traces of poison. Once we get the results, the course of further investigation will be decided,"" Gadhia said.

NEW DELHI/CHANDIGARH: AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has called Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann, ministers and party MLAs to Delhi for deliberations on Tuesday, in a move that was not only seen as aimed at insulating its government but also termed by rivals as ""preparation"" for the removal of Mann from the top post.Although AAP termed it an ""organisational meeting"" for feedback and acknowledging work done by Mann and Punjab MLAs in Delhi polls, it intensified speculation about unrest in the party over failure to deliver its poll promises and growing tensions between Kejriwal and Mann. AAP Punjab netas will attend along with party members from Delhi.Stirring the pot, BJP's Tarun Chugh claimed ""countdown for Mann's government has started"", while party MLA Majinder Sirsa cautioned the CM on ""plans afoot to remove him"".Congress talked about the imminent prospect of mid-term polls in Punjab. ""More than 30 AAP MLAs in Punjab are in touch with us,"" said leader of opposition in Punjab, Partap Singh Bajwa, while Congress MP from Gurdaspur Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa predicted mid-term polls. ""It depends on how many AAP MLAs switch sides. Congress is the only option for AAP MLAs as BJP has no future in state,"" he said.AAP senior spokesperson Neel Garg, however, accused Sirsa of ""rumour mongering"" to please BJP leadership as he was in race for Delhi CM's post. ""Mann is leading a stable AAP government in Punjab and Sirsa should now worry about delivering BJP's pre-poll promises in Delhi,"" he said.""Bajwa is dreaming impossible dreams - just like 'Mungerilal'. Even his brother (Fatehjang Bajwa) joined BJP,"" AAP MP Malvinder Singh Kang said, downplaying speculation on dissent within AAP & calling Kejriwal's meeting with Punjab MLAs a ""routine strategy session"". After Kejriwal called the meeting, Punjab government Monday postponed a cabinet meeting which had to be held after nearly 5 months to decide dates for state budget session. ""Delhi got rid of 'AAP-da'and now Punjab also want to get rid of it. Mann government has failed to tackle the liquor, sand and mining mafia,"" BJP national general secretary Chugh said.Political circles were also surprised by the move because of both timing and the optics. Mann, ministers and MLAs of Punjab being called to Delhi is a throwback to days when the all-powerful ""high command"" could dispense with niceties and need to be sensitive to regional sentiments.Congress Punjab in-charge Devender Yadav told TOI, ""AAP MLAs have been restless over being controlled from Delhi. Now that Kejriwal has lost in Delhi, the unrest is growing. This uncertainty over where the control lies could trigger a split as a splinter group within AAP MLAs has been taking shape for some time.""","Congress's bajwa says 30 of mann's mlas in touch; 'mungerilal', says aap.

NEW DELHI: BJP scored a spectacular victory in all parliamentary constituency areas to win 48 of the 70 assembly seats in the capital. In particular, it was the party's performance in outer Delhi, areas bordering Haryana, that helped it rout AAP and storm back to power after 27 years. AAP, for its part, continued its impressive run in Muslim- and Dalit-dominated seats apart from winning isolated pockets with a higher number of JJ clusters and unauthorised colonies.BJP triumphed in nine of the 10 seats in the West Delhi parliamentary constituency, eight each in North West Delhi and East Delhi and seven in New Delhi.The remaining seats came from Chandni Chowk, where six of its candidates emerged victorious, and five each in South Delhi and North East Delhi.In the 2020 assembly polls, when BJP tallied just eight seats, the party had failed to win a single seat in New Delhi, West Delhi, South Delhi and Chandni Chowk. While one BJP candidate was elected from North West Delhi, three each returned from East Delhi and North East Delhi.BJP, thus, not only made inroads in urban pockets of central Delhi and New Delhi this time, but also almost swept the outer Delhi areas and rural parts of the city. ""Of the 13 seats that share a border with Uttar Pradesh, we got seven while of the 11 constituencies on the border with Haryana, we won nine,"" smiled a BJP functionary.Narela, Mundka, Badli, Najafgarh, Palam, Bijwasan, Matiala, Chhatarpur and Mehrauli were some of the prominent rural seats where BJP had failed to do anything impressive in the last two elections but where it performed extremely well this year. Surender Solanki, chief of Palam 360 Khap, said the rural voters came out in large numbers to support BJP. ""The villages, be it rural or urban, were completely ignored by Delhi govt. We ran a campaign, visited every single city village, interacted with the residents and prepared a list of demands. We approached all political parties. While AAP continued to ignore us, the PM called us as did the Union home minister and assured us our issues will be addressed. The Khap, accordingly, supported BJP,"" said Solanki.The Khap chief added that BJP managed to wrest several seats with the support of the villagers from AAP, which itself had grabbed them from Congress in 2013.AAP held on to its support base in reserved constituencies. While the party had won all 12 SC seats in 2015 and 2020, it retained eight seats this time. Similarly, people came out in large numbers in constituencies dotted with unauthorised colonies in its support. Gokalpur, Ambedkar Nagar, Kondli, Okhla, Badarpur, Tughlaqabad, Deoli, Kirari, Burari and Sultanpur Majra are known for having large clusters of unauthorised colonies.An AAP functionary explained why. ""In our campaign, we highlighted the work done by our govt to improve the amenities in the city's 1,797 unauthorised colonies. We connected these colonies with sewer and water pipelines, laid down roads, built drains and improved overall living conditions. The support we got from the residents of some of such colonies is a validation of our work.""While the Muslim vote showed signs of division in a couple of constituencies, it largely went in the favour of AAP, getting big victories for its candidates. Except Mustafabad, where the Hindu votes consolidated against a trifurcation of Muslims votes, AAP won comprehensively in Okhla, Seelampur, Matia Mahal and Ballimaran. It also performed reasonably well in areas where Muslims live in large numbers but are not the deciding force, such as at Kirari and Seemapuri.Despite being the partners in the INDIA bloc, a grouping of opposition parties at the national level, AAP and Congress contested the assembly election separately. This was to BJP's advantage. According to an analysis, there are 14 seats that BJP won because Congress garnered more votes than the margin between the winner and the closest rival. These seats are Timarpur, Badli, Nangloi Jat, Madipur, Rajendra Nagar, New Delhi, Jangpura, Kasturba Nagar, Malviya Nagar, Mehrauli, Chhatarpur, Sangam Vihar, Greater Kailash and Trilokpuri.Some political observers believed that had Congress and AAP contested the election as alliance partners, the results could have been different. Although the vote cutting by Congress was evident in its candidates saving their security deposits only in Kasturba Nagar, Badli and Nangloi Jat, a Congress functionary refused to accept the theory. ""We contested the Lok Sabha election jointly and the result was we failed to win a single seat. Theoretically, one can say that the alliance could have prevented the BJP juggernaut, but the results could have been totally different too,"" the Congress member argued.","Bjp scored a spectacular victory in all parliamentary constituency areas to win 48 of the 70 assembly seats in the capital. The party's performance in outer delhi, areas bordering haryana, helped it rout aap and storm back to power after 27 years. Aap, for its part, continued its impressive run in muslim- and dalit-dominated seats.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118075048,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1489430,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Though the father has re-married, it cannot stand against the claim for custody; especially since otherwise, there would have been a question raised as to how the child would be taken care of; the father being engaged in his work,"" the court said.It also noted that paternal grandfather has also deposited an amount of Rs 10 lakh in the child's name and he also has also taken out a life insurance policy of Rs 25 lakh, the beneficiary of which is the minor child and it showed that the family cared about the child.""We cannot but observe that the learned Single Judge (of HC) has not endeavored to elicit the child's attitude towards his father. Admittedly, the child, after his birth, was with his parents for about 10 years till the death of his mother. He was separated from the father in 2021 and has been living with his grandparents, who cannot have a better claim than the father, who is the natural guardian. There is no allegation of any matrimonial dispute when the mother of the child was alive nor a complaint of abuse perpetrated against the wife or son,"" the bench said.","A father had his minor son taken away by in-laws after the death of his first wife.

Centre plans stiffer fines for those entering India illegally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-plans-stiffer-fines-for-those-entering-india-illegally/articleshow/118159070.cms,"NEW DELHI: Any foreigner who enters India without a valid passport or visa could invite a jail term of up to five years and a fine of up to Rs 5 lakh. In case entry and stay in or exit from India by a foreigner is with a forged passport or travel document, the imprisonment will not be less than two years, but may extend to seven years, and the fine, Rs 1 lakh, can go up to Rs 10 lakh.These are provisions of the Immigration and Foreigners Bill, 2025, set to be introduced in Lok Sabha in this session, that seeks to repeal four Acts with overlapping provisions on the related subjects of immigration and foreigners, and consolidate them into a single, comprehensive legislation. The four Acts are Foreigners Act, 1946; Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920; Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939; and Immigration (Carriers' Liability), 2000.As of now the maximum penalty for a foreigner entering the country without a valid passport or travel document, including visa, is five years in jail and fine. For those entering on a forged passport, the maximum penalty is eight years in jail and up to Rs 50,000 fine.The bill also seeks to make all higher educational institutions and universities liable to share information on any foreigner admitted, with the registration officer specified for such category of foreigners. This provision will also apply to all hospitals, nursing homes and other medical institutions with lodging facilities on their premises.It is proposed under the bill that any foreigner overstaying his/her visa or violating conditions of the visa, or accessing a prohibited or restricted area, will be punished with up to three years in jail or fine of up to Rs 3 lakh, or both.The bill also proposes to hold a carrier responsible for ferrying a foreigner found by the immigration officer here as not having a valid passport or travel document/visa.The immigration officer can impose a penalty of up to Rs 5 lakh on the carrier, though not without hearing its version. If the penalty is not paid, it may be recovered by seizing or detaining the carrier that may be an aircraft, ship or any other mode of transport.The proposed legislation provides central govt powers to restrict entry of a foreigner or class of foreigners, to not depart from India, not enter a specified area, exit from India at his own cost and require him to allow his photograph and biometrics to be taken.","Any foreigner who enters india without a valid passport or visa could invite a jail term of up to five years.

violated: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has ruled that investigating agencies are duty-bound to inform grounds of arrest to the accused while taking them into custody and failure to comply with it would render the arrest illegal. It said the requirement to inform the grounds of arrest is not a ""formality but a mandatory constitutional requirement"".A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and N K Singh quashed an arrest made by Gurgaon police, saying the accused had not been not informed of the grounds of his arrest. Though the court refrained from passing an order on the mode of communication of grounds of arrest, it said it would be better if it was communicated in writing as the burden would be on the police to prove that the grounds of arrest were communicated.In a concurring but separate order, Justice Singh said the requirement of communicating the grounds of arrest in writing is not only to the arrested person, but also to friends, relatives or such other person as may be disclosed or nominated by the arrested person.. The court said the right to be informed about the grounds of arrest flows from Article 22(1) of the Constitution and any infringement of this fundamental right would vitiate the process of arrest and remand. It said a police officer cannot ""casually"" arrest a person in a cognisable offence, and that it could be done only when credible information was received.The bench said, ""Thus, the requirement of informing the person arrested of the grounds of arrest is not a formality but a mandatory constitutional requirement. Article 22 is included in Part III of the Constitution under the heading of Fundamental Rights . Thus, it is the fundamental right of every person arrested and detained in custody to be informed of the grounds of arrest as soon as possible.""If the grounds of arrest are not informed as soon as may be after the arrest, it would amount to a violation of the fundamental right of the arrestee guaranteed under Article 22(1). It will also amount to depriving the arrestee of his liberty. The reason is that, as provided in Article 21, no person can be deprived of his liberty except in accordance with the procedure established by law.""It further said, ""The procedure established by law also includes what is provided in Article 22(1). Therefore, when a person is arrested without a warrant, and the grounds of arrest are not informed to him as soon as may be after the arrest, it will amount to a violation of his fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 as well.""The court said the grounds of arrest must be informed in a language which the arrestee understands and held that it is the duty of the courts to ascertain whether compliance with Article 22(1) and other mandatory safeguards has been made while remanding the accused.""When a violation of Article 22(1) is established, it is the duty of the court to forthwith order the release of the accused. That will be a ground to grant bail even if statutory restrictions on the grant of bail exist. The statutory restrictions do not affect the power of the court to grant bail when the violation of Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution is established,"" it said.",Court must release accused if right to liberty isviolated: supreme court.

Centre can't impose service tax on sale of lotteries: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-cant-impose-service-tax-on-sale-of-lotteries-sc/articleshow/118158597.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that the Centre cannot impose service tax on sale of lotteries as the lottery business comes under the State List.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and N K Singh said service tax was not leviable on transactions between the purchaser of lottery tickets and the state govt and upheld Sikkim High Court's order which said all activities - from publishing of lottery tickets to participating in the game of chance, declaration of draw and even distribution of prize to the winner - fell within the purview of the expression 'betting and gambling', coming within the exclusive domain of Entry 62 - List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.The court passed the order on an appeal filed by the Centre claiming the right to levy service tax on lottery transactions. Examining various amendments made in the Finance Act, the bench said, ""We find that at each stage, the amendments made to the Finance Act, 1994, in order to impose service tax on the sole distributor/purchaser of the lottery tickets (respondents-assessees herein) have been unsuccessful. We have reasoned that the amendment to the said definition would in no way detract from the substance of the relationship between the state government and the sole distributor or purchaser of lottery tickets which is one of principal-to-principal and not of principal-agent. There being no agency and no service rendered by the respondents-assessees herein as an agent to the government of Sikkim, service tax is not leviable on the transactions between the purchaser of lottery tickets (respondents-assessees herein) and the government of Sikkim.""The bench said detailed analysis of the relevant provisions of the Finance Act, 1994, and amendments made thereto in light of the clauses of the agreements highlighted during the course of submissions, as well as the judgments of this court ""would not persuade us to take a different view from what Sikkim High Court has taken"". ""In view of the aforesaid discussion, we find no merit in the appeals filed by the Union of India and others,"" it said.The court noted that there was no Entry in any of the Lists of the Seventh Schedule specifically provided for levying taxes on lotteries and the power to enact laws for taxing lotteries must be understood as inherent within the expressions 'betting and gambling', as lottery activities fell within this category which is a state subject.The HC had held that the lottery was organised by the state govt through its various stockists etc but could not be construed to be a service rendered to the state govt and the question of service tax did not arise.",The court passed the order on an appeal filed by the centre claiming the right to levy service tax on lottery transactions.
