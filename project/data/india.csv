Red Fort to host Unesco meet on protecting intangible heritage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/red-fort-to-host-unesco-meet-on-protecting-intangible-heritage/articleshow/125798702.cms,"How Kashmir’s Jaish Posters Led To Delhi’s Red Fort Blast And Exposed A Nationwide Terror Network

NEW DELHI: The Red Fort complex in the heart of the capital will be the venue of the 20th session of the Intergovernmental Committee for Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage from Dec 8-13 with over 1,000 delegates from more than 185 countries expected to participate. The inauguration will be held on Sunday.Undeterred by the blast that occurred on Nov 10 near the historical monument, the govt is going all out to uphold the spirit of India and send out a strong message from the Red Fort complex, also a Unesco World Heritage Site.From varied galleries showcasing art, history and artefacts to states setting up stalls to present India’s diverse culture and stage performances — the Red Fort is all set to bring alive the India story over the next one week in one place. The culture ministry plans to keep the cultural components and the galleries open even after the meeting is over so that people can visit them over the next one month in the run-up to Republic Day on Jan 26.The meeting is not only a significant platform for cultural diplomacy and showcasing India’s soft power, but also important as it has formally proposed the festival of Diwali for inclusion in Unesco’s Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) list.India’s nomination will be examined for inscription on the list at the session. This will mark a significant step to gain global recognition for this major festival, following previous Indian inclusions like Durga Puja in Kolkata, Kumbh Mela, Buddhist chanting of Ladakh, Yoga, Nawrouz and Garba of Gujarat.India currently has 15 elements inscribed on Unesco’s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.On why Red Fort was chosen, culture minister Gajendra Shekhawat said one day when he came with officials to the site to review the state of maintenance and management of the monument, this thought came up that why not hold this global meet on intangible heritage in a Unesco World Heritage site. “It was challenging but everyone in the ministry worked hard as a team. They kept working despite the recent incident (the blast case near Red Fort) that you saw. Three new galleries have also been readied. We are now ready to welcome the dignitaries,” he added.The meeting will examine nominations submitted by state parties for inscription on the Unesco ICH list, review the status of existing elements and provide international assistance for safeguarding intangible cultural heritage.","The red fort complex in the heart of the capital will be the venue of the 20th session of the intergovernmental committee for safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage from dec 8-13.

‘Excessive conditions’ in public dealings must be set aside as illegal: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/excessive-conditions-in-public-dealings-must-be-set-aside-as-illegal-sc/articleshow/125798396.cms,"Simplicity in transactions good governance, says SC

Insistence on unnecessary documentation and circuitous procedures in govt offices remain a harrowing experience for citizens of the country. But in an important decision to simplify administrative procedures and infuse reform, Supreme Court on Friday ruled that govt’s insistence on unnecessary, excessive requirements in public dealings must be set aside as illegal.Terming simplified processes as a hallmark of good governance, a bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Atul S Chandurkar said the authorities must resist imposing superfluous and redundant requirements as they make any procedure complicated, causing loss of time and, also, peace of mind.The bench declared a memo issued in 2009 by Jharkhand govt illegal on the basis that it was not needed. The memo mandated an additional recommendation of assistant registrar as a pre-condition for registration of a document under Section 9A of Indian Stamp Act. The court said that when a cooperative society is registered, the certificate of registration signed and sealed by the registrar shall be conclusive evidence.The additional requirement imposed by govt, SC noted, is “disruptive to ease of transaction, without any value addition to the integrity of the transaction”.“Simplicity in public transactions is good governance. Constitutional courts uphold this virtue to strengthen the rule of law and ensure access to justice.In administrative law, simplicity means laws, regulations and procedures should be clear, straightforward and easy to understand, allowing for effortless compliance. Administrative procedures should avoid complexity, redundant requirements and unnecessary burdens, which waste time, expense, and disturb peace of mind,” Justice Narasimha, who penned the judgment for the bench, said.“While higher courts set aside executive decisions on the grounds of illegality if they are not founded on relevant considerations, or even when the decisions are based on irrelevant considerations, it is important to recognise the principle that executive actions that mandate certain unnecessary, excessive requirements must equally be set aside as illegal,” he said.The court further elaborated that “irrelevant consideration includes insistence or performance of acts or submission of documents, which neither have relevance nor are value additions to the purpose or object of law or policy in place. Instead, they are demonstrably superfluous and unnecessary, consuming limited time and human resources. This also has a direct bearing on efficiency and good governance...”The bench said administrative law has well recognised the principle of an administrative decision becoming unlawful if the decision fails to take into account relevant considerations, or even when it takes into account irrelevant considerations.","Simplicity in public transactions is good governance, says supreme court.

Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar , the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality . The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.Philosophers have struggled for centuries to frame a description that captures its many shades. The one that feels disarmingly simple comes from Merriam-Webster: “.” But is truth really that simple?Across time, thinkers, theologians, and scientists have searched for a definition that is complete, objective, and universal. Advaita Vedanta, for instance, distinguishes between—the absolutely real, like the sun;—the absolutely unreal, like a human with horns; and—the apparently real, like a clear blue sky that vanishes once you cross earth’s atmosphere.Ancient scriptures also outline three ways of knowing the truth:(direct perception),(inference), and(reliable testimony).Pratyaksha is what we experience through our senses —Anumaana is what we logically deduce —Shruthi is what we accept based on credible authority — we trust Stephen Hawking when he explains black holes.And then there are radical departures — Nietzsche’s declaration that truth is merely a forgotten illusion, a metaphor so worn that we mistake it for reality.But philosophy aside, truth meets most of us in quieter, more personal ways. In Thi. Janakiraman’s short story ‘’ it becomes a mirror. A little boy falls in love with a picture of Krishna — the serene flute-player among his cows. He stops at the shop each day just to gaze at it, until the kind shopkeeper finally hands it to him, to his joy.The next day, an older, sly boy demands something in exchange for playing with him, making him say — ‘’. Only after the promise is uttered does he reveal what he wants: the Krishna picture.The younger child hesitates only for a breath, and hands over the one thing he treasures.The father, having overheard everything, scolds the child for giving it away, but the boy replies, “I promised.” It is a moment of pure, unfiltered truth. The father is moved to tears, overwhelmed by the clarity of the child’s heart. Then, as fathers do, he worries:And the mother, steady and practical, reassures him: “He will learn when he grows.”Isn’t that how all of us began? With that fierce belief that a promise is a promise. But then life happened. First came the small lies. Somewhere along the way, the shining, uncompromising truth of childhood gathered dust.Thiruvalluvar valued truth above all virtues. “” he declares. Yet he also gives truth a companion: compassion. If the truth is going to shatter a heart, and a gentle lie can heal it, he urges us to choose healing — provided the lie serves. This is not moral compromise; it is moral maturity.Perhaps this is the closest we come to understanding truth: a light that must illuminate, not burn; a principle that must uplift, not hurt. Truth, at its highest, is not merely factual. It is humane.Sahil GuptaVoice your thoughts!

was unwell & crying... I’m worried, says her mother

KOLKATA: Birbhum resident Sunali Khatun, nine months and 12 days pregnant, returned to India along with her son, Shabir, 8, on Friday evening, six months after the family’s ordeal began with Delhi Police detaining them as “illegal immigrants”, BSF pushing them into Bangladesh, and authorities there jailing them for illegal entry.Mother and son entered Bengal through the Mahadipur border checkpoint in Malda around 7pm and were received by zilla parishad sabhadhipati Lipika Ghosh and other Trinamool functionaries. Officials took them to Malda Medical College and Hospital, where doctors ran tests to decide when she can travel four-and-a-half hours by road to reach her home in Birbhum.Bangladeshi couple Farooq and Mumtaj Hossain, who hosted Sunali Khatun and her family after they received bail a few days ago, said doctors in Chapai Nawabganj had planned to induce labour. They abandoned the plan when Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) said she needed to be handed over to BSF immediately. Sunali’s husband Danish Sk remains in Bangladesh, awaiting completion of repatriation formalities along with fellow Birbhum resident Sweety Biwi & her two sons.All six were deported on June 26 despite having Aadhaar and other identity documents, their lawyers said. Sunali, Danish and Sweety had been earning a living as ragpickers in Delhi when they were rounded up on June 17 on suspicion of being Bangladeshis living illegally in India.With 26-year-old Sunali’s repatriation getting delayed despite Supreme Court’s Dec 3 directive to govt to ensure her return “during the course of the day”, her counsel had mailed the court’s registry early Friday for an urgent hearing by the bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi.Things began to move around 3.30pm after a BGB team and Indian embassy officials reached Chapai Nawabganj to escort Sunali and her child from the house where they were being kept, till the international border. Rampurhat chief medical officer Sovan De said all possible medical arrangements were made for Sunali’s arrival in Birbhum. Social worker Mofijul Sk, who was in Bangladesh to facilitate her return, said an ambulance would take her from Malda to her home once doctors certified her fit to travel.Sunali’s mother Jyotsna and her daughter Anisha returned to their Birbhum home from Delhi on Friday. Both had travelled to the national capital for the SC hearing on Dec 3. “We boarded a train from Delhi as soon as we were told Sunali was coming back. I am worried about her health. She was feeling unwell and crying when I spoke to her at noon,” Jyotsna said. West Bengal Migrant Welfare Board chairperson Samirul Islam, who led the legal battle for Sunali’s repatriation, wrote on X that her return would be remembered as “a historic moment that exposes the torture and atrocities inflicted on poor Bengalis”.(With inputs from Subhro Maitra in Malda and S Boral in Suri)","Sunali khatun, nine months and 12 days pregnant, returned to india along with her son, shabir, 8, on friday evening.

NAGPUR: Quoting a Supreme Court ruling, Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has said the use of loudspeakers is not essential to practising a religion, and that amplified sound cannot infringe on the rights of unwilling listeners. Dismissing a plea by Masjid Gousiya in Maharashtra’s Gondia district, seeking a directive to restore use of loudspeakers at the mosque, the bench on Monday said the petitioner failed to produce any legal or religious document establishing a right to use loudspeakers for offering prayers.A division bench said: “The top court had observed that no religion prescribes prayers be performed by disturbing the peace of others through voice amplifiers or drum beating.” At a hearing on Oct 16, HC asked the petitioner to demonstrate whether installing loudspeakers was mandatory in religious practice.The petitioner could not produce supporting material and was “not entitled to seek relief”, it said. “The SC had also noted that while there is a right to speech, there exists a right to listen or decline to listen. Nobody can be compelled to listen, and nobody can claim he has a right to make his voice trespass the minds of others,” the bench observed.

Do we need a law that deals with marital rape? Watch what Delhi, Mumbai residents have to say

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Friday introduced a private member’s bill in the Lok Sabha to criminalise marital rape, calling it an urgent need to uphold women’s rights, emphasising India’s constitutional values.Speaking during the introduction of the bill, the veteran Congress leader told the parliament that the country must move from “No means no” to “Only yes means yes"".In his social media posts later, Tharoor said the marital rape bill seeks to amend the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and remove the current exception that allows non-consensual sex within marriage.“Every woman deserves bodily autonomy and dignity within marriage. Marital rape is about violence, not marriage. The moment for action has arrived,” he said.The bill notes that Section 63 of the law currently excludes marital rape as a punishable offence, leaving married women without legal protection and perpetuating outdated patriarchal notions.""This failure to criminalise marital rape has left married women legally defenceless, distinguishing them from unmarried women and perpetuating the misconception that marriage voids the necessity of consent.This undermines women's fundamental rights to dignity, safety and bodily autonomy,"" the statement of objects and reasons of the bill said.""Allowing a husband to force sex upon his wife disregards her autonomy and perpetuates a culture of control and gender-based violence. Similarly, factors unrelated to a woman's autonomy, such as her caste, profession, clothing choices, personal beliefs or past sexual conduct, should never be used to presume her consent. Such assumptions not only perpetuate gender-based inequality but also violate her fundamental rights and dignity. They must be unequivocally rejected,"" the statement further said.Tharoor also introduced two other private members’ bills — one to amend the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020, and another to set up a permanent States and Union Territories Reorganisation Commission to guide future reorganisation of states and Union territories.A private member bills allow MPs from opposition parties to propose laws, though most are withdrawn after government review.","Congress mp shashi tharoor introduces bill in lok sabha to criminalise marital rape.

MADURAI: The Karthigai Deepam issue has snowballed into a major controversy in Tamil Nadu, with the state govt Thursday defying for the second time a Madras HC order allowing lighting of the lamp at Deepathoon (a stone lamp pillar) atop Thiruparankundram hills, even as a division bench of the HC rejected its appeal against a contempt order. Meanwhile, BJP state chief Nainar Nagendran and dozens of others were detained by police during protests.State govt filed an SLP in the Supreme Court challenging the division bench order, which dismissed its appeal against a single bench order on a contempt plea.Earlier in the day, the bench of Justices G Jayachandran and K K Ramakrishnan dismissed the state’s appeal, saying it was meant to preempt contempt action. The bench upheld Justice G R Swaminathan’s orders permitting lighting of the lamp at Deepathoon with CISF protection. The single bench had also initiated contempt proceedings Wednesday after the Deepam was lit at Uchi Pillaiyar Temple, not at Deepathoon atop the hill, as directed by it on Dec 1.Despite the single-bench order on Wednesday, police had prevented the petitioner and 10 others, who had been allowed to light the lamp at Deepathoon, from proceeding to the hills citing prohibitory orders.Following the rejection of the state’s appeal Thursday, Justice Swaminathan resumed the contempt proceedings, quashed the prohibitory orders imposed by Madurai district administration, and once again permitted lighting of the lamp atop the hill, this time under protection of Madurai city police. If officials defied the order, “harsh consequences will ensue”, the judge said.However, police once again stopped the individuals from proceeding, saying it would be detrimental to public order. It was a re-enactment of the scene from Wednesday at the Thiruparankundram foothills, with hundreds of BJP workers and Hindu group activists protesting against state govt, and over 1,000 police personnel deployed. BJP’s Nagendran had an argument with police before he was detained along with several others, including H Raja and Amarprasad Reddy, and about 50 cadres to prevent them from proceeding to the hills.Meanwhile, the HC division bench will on Dec 5 take up the appeals filed by Madurai district collector and executive officer of the Subramaniya Swamy temple authorities, challenging the order passed by the single bench allowing the lamp to be lit at Deepathoon.Justice Swaminathan had Monday allowed Rama Ravikumar and other petitioners to light the lamp at Deepathoon, brushing aside objections on proximity of the site to a dargah and the fact that the lamp has been lit at Uchi Pillaiyar Temple for decades.","State govt files an slp in the supreme court challenging the division bench order, which dismissed its appeal against a single bench order on a contempt plea.

All IndiGo flights to Delhi were cancelled on Friday due to 'operational issues', prompting many travellers - especially those headed for international connections at IGI Airport - to book last-minute taxis. Several passengers told TOI that they had to fork out nearly twice the normal fare of Rs 5,000-6,000.Those who had time switched to trains, but most had to cough up extra for a cab ride. Arun Kumar and Naina, who were headed to Canada, said they had no option but to book a cab after their flight to Delhi was cancelled. ""We paid Rs 10,000 for a taxi to IGI. Just last week, our friends went for Rs 5,500,"" they said.In Nagpur, abrupt disruptions & repeated cancellations forced hundreds of passengers to turn to private sleeper bus operators, who stepped in to travel to major metros like Mumbai and Bengaluru at short notice. Unlike Chandigarh, however, operators did not hike charges despite the sudden influx, said private bus operator Mukesh Chaurasiya, who runs a fleet of sleeper coaches. ""We charged normal fares. People were genuinely relieved because they had no other option left,"" he said.""Yesterday alone, I provided four to five buses from Nagpur to Mumbai after flights got cancelled. My buses even had to go directly to the airport because so many passengers were stranded, especially after the Bengaluru flight was cancelled,"" Chaurasiya told TOI.""Even today, five to seven buses are coming from Mumbai to Nagpur. We're getting inquiries from Delhi and other cities as well, but our capacity is limited,"" he added.Other private bus operators, too, confirmed a spike in emergency bookings. When TOI checked online fares for Saturday's buses from Nagpur to Mumbai, the AC sleeper seats were less than Rs 3,000.

Massive Outrage Over IndiGo Chaos, Over 600 Flights Cancelled In India's Biggest Aviation Crisis

New Delhi: Mass flight cancellations by IndiGo have sent fares on competing airlines soaring as passengers scramble for alternatives on routes dominated by India's largest carrier.One-way economy tickets for Sunday on Delhi-Mumbai sector range from Rs 21,577 to Rs 39,000 across airlines other than IndiGo. Bengaluru-Kolkata tickets cost between Rs 20,000 and Rs 23,000 each while Chennai-Delhi seats are priced around Rs 21,000.IndiGo, which holds 64% of India's domestic market share, has told passengers it expects to resume normal operations between Dec 10 and 15. Seats on available IndiGo flights scheduled for the next several days cost roughly half the price of competitors due to the uncertainty caused by operational disruptions.The remaining airlines - Air India, Air India Express, SpiceJet and Akasa Air - collectively control 36% of domestic capacity. When passengers avoid IndiGo and concentrate demand on this smaller pool of seats, fares invariably increase based on supply constraints. Regional routes show even sharper increases. Udaipur-Delhi one-way economy tickets for Sunday cost between Rs 15,367 and Rs 26,406 on non-IndiGo carriers.Udaipur-Mumbai fares range from Rs 24,000 to Rs 35,000.Mahima Shukla, a Delhi-based CA, flew to Udaipur Friday by Air India Express and was to return Sunday on an IndiGo flight. ""I am trying to cancel that ticket as I have to be in office Monday. Udaipur-Delhi on other airlines costs upwards of Rs 21,000. This is a double whammy,"" she said.A Delhi-based businessman termed the crisis ""possibly the worst phase in Indian aviation in many years"".

Tickets for several relatives were also booked for the same day.Then the trouble started. Family members said IndiGo staff kept telling them the flight was ""delayed"", beginning 9am on Dec 2 and continuing late into the night.Finally, on the morning of Dec 3 - just hours before the reception - the airline informed the passengers that the flight had been cancelled.With no alternative travel arrangement possible at such short notice, the bride and groom got stuck in Bhubaneswar.

Exemptions will put safety at risk, says pilots’ body

NEW DELHI: Govt has put on hold the new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) norms for pilots with “immediate effect for now” and expects normalcy in IndiGo operations to be restored by Dec 15.The aviation ministry’s decision came Friday when over 1,000 IndiGo flights — more than half its schedule — were cancelled, with none operating from Delhi, wreaking havoc on plans of lakhs of fliers. IndiGo is offering full waiver on cancellation /reschedule requests on travel from Dec 5 to 15. On Saturday, less than 1,000 flights are likely to be cancelled. The number will gradually fall.On Thursday — when its on-time performance touched its nadir at 8.5% — IndiGo had sought exemption from certain norms, such as the cap on number of night landings a pilot can make between midnight and 6am, to restore normalcy in Airbus A320 operations by Feb 10, 2026. Since that was a long way off, govt put Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s FDTL orders in abeyance.The week-long flight operation disruptions in IndiGo has wiped out nearly Rs 20,000 crore worth of market value for Interglobe Aviations, the company that runs the airline. In past one week, the stock has fallen nearly 9% to Rs 5,371 on BSE at Friday’s close with the airlines major’s current market cap at nearly Rs 2.1 lakh crore now.From its Nov 28 close at Rs 5,904 on BSE, the stock had fallen to an intra-day low of Rs 5,266 during Friday’s session. However, after DGCA allowed the airlines some temporary leeway with crew management rules, the stock recovered some ground to close at Rs 5,371, market players said.While IndiGo’s stock suffered due to the ongoing crisis, the stock price of SpiceJet, one of its smaller competitors, gained. Friday SpiceJet stock price rallied 2.5% on BSE to close at Rs 31.Putting on hold Friday its orders meant to ensure that pilots are not fatigued, thereby boosting flight safety, govt said the move will not compromise on safety of passengers. “This decision has been taken solely in the interest of passengers, especially senior citizens, students, patients and others who rely on timely air travel for essential needs... taken urgent measures to address the ongoing disruption in flight schedules, particularly those of IndiGo,” Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said.DGCA has constituted a four-member committee headed by a joint DG for a “comprehensive review and assessment of circumstances leading to operational disruption of IndiGo. Committee will identify accountabilities for failure and adequacy of subsequent mitigation measures being taken by IndiGo,” a govt statement said.Aviation authorities say all possible steps are being taken to stabilise IndiGo operations at the earliest. DGCA has offered its Airbus A320-type-rated flight operations inspectors (FOIs) to operate flights for IndiGo in an attempt to help the airline recover from its lowest operational point in over 19 years of existence. “FOIs operate a flight every month (to keep their licences valid). We have made this offer to IndiGo, they did not ask for it, to help it get back on its feet as quickly as possible,” said sources.A significant number of pilots for IndiGo and for some other Indian carriers are upset at losing their hard-earned right to a more humane roster. “Airlines treat us as mere cost-cutting items in their income and expenditure statements during their good days. When it fell on bad days last month, we helped as much as working at 120%. But that could not have gone on indefinitely as we remember how they treat us,” said many senior pilots.Sensing the simmering discontent, Naidu held meetings over video links with some pilot bodies and assured them that the exemption from the new FDTL was temporary. DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai issued an appeal to pilots’ associations as the aviation sector is under “significant stress”.“As we now approach fog season, peak holiday period, and marriage travel season, it is crucial that the industry prepares for even greater operational challenges. Passenger volumes are expected to rise sharply, and weather-related impacts may further complicate scheduling and flight safety. Given this situation, we earnestly request full cooperation of all pilot bodies, associations, and pilots across India,” Ahmed’s letter says.IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers issued a video statement saying normalcy could return between Dec 10 and 15, while admitting the crisis had “shaken customers’ belief in IndiGo’s reliability, built over the last 19 years”.Hours after govt relaxed key provisions of the new duty-and-rest norms to help IndiGo stabilise its pilot roster and flight operations, the Indian pilot community criticised the civil aviation regulator, demanding that the said dispensations be withdrawn immediately.The relaxations now allow IndiGo to roster its pilots for longer duty hours than permitted under Phase II of revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms, which came into effect on Nov 1 after a preparatory period of about two years. FDTL norms are mandatory regulatory limits that define the maximum duty hours and minimum rest periods that should be factored in when rostering pilots for duty so as to keep crew fatigue under check and maintain operational safety. Each country formulates its own FDTL based on specific operational realities and scientific studies.In a strongly worded letter to DGCA, Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA) said selective exemptions compromise safety and undermine the intent of the rules. The union also sought a probe into what it termed an “artificial pilot-shortage narrative” created by IndiGo, punitive action against the airline’s accountable management, and full enforcement of Phase II of the FDTL without exemptions. Airlines in India adopted Phase II of FDTL on Nov 1.The dispensations have destroyed regulatory parity, undermined public trust in DGCA’s neutrality, compromised scientifically established fatigue protections, and placed millions of passengers at heightened risk, said ALPA. Aviation safety expert Capt Amit Singh said the changes bypass the established procedure for exemptions. “These are ad hoc changes. There was no pilot representation before these changes were made,” he said, adding that exemptions must follow safety risk assessments in line with International Civil Aviation Organisation norms.Meanwhile, ALPA’s strongest objection pertained to changes in night operations; relaxation of the definition of night (midnight to 5am was extended in the new FDTL to midnight to 6am) and doubling of permitted landings “encroaching night” — the return to the 5am definition means that a pilot rostered for, say, 5.30am, will not be considered as flying night operations — from two to four, contradicting the revised FDTL and “fundamentally diluting” fatigue protections.DGCA has effectively acknowledged that IndiGo pilots will now fly with reduced rest and increased fatigue, placing passengers at higher risk, it said. It referred to a Nov 24 meeting ALPA had with DGCA in which it was “unequivocally agreed” that no dispensation, exemption or variation, especially for commercial reasons, would be granted to any operator. “FDTL norms exist solely to safeguard human life, and any dilution would expose pilots, passengers, and aircraft to unacceptable risks,” it said.The association questioned why widespread disruptions surfaced 35 days after Phase II came into force: IndiGo had nearly two years to prepare for the Nov 1 implementation of Phase II of revised duty and rest rules for pilot rostering. “These events raise serious concerns that an artificial crisis was engineered to exert pressure on govt for commercial gain under the pretext of public inconvenience.”ALPA warned that if the dispensations are not revoked, DGCA, and not pilots, must bear responsibility for any fatigue-related incident arising from the relaxations.","Indigo m-cap wiped out by nearly 20,000 crore.putting rule on hold in flyers’ interest, won’t compromise safety: govt.

Rajnath Singh Claims Nehru Wanted Babri Built With Public Funds But Sardar Patel Blocked His Plan

KOLKATA/BEHRAMPORE: Calcutta HC directed the Bengal govt Friday to do whatever it takes to pre-empt communal disturbance in Murshidabad’s Beldanga ahead of suspended TMC MLA Humayun Kabir ’s planned foundation-laying ceremony for a “Babri Masjid”, coinciding with the Dec 6 anniversary of the Ayodhya structure’s 1992 demolition.“The state must act per its stand...

Deputy solicitor-general Rajdeep Majumdar said 19 companies of CISF were stationed in the area. A 3,500-strong security contingent, including RAF units, fanned out into Rejinagar and its surrounding areas on the eve of the event. Two BSF companies are on standby to secure NH-12.MLA Kabir, suspended by TMC a day ago, was summoned to Rejinagar police station Friday evening and questioned for several hours, sources said.Earlier in the day, a defiant Kabir supervised arrangements for Saturday’s event and asked his team to arrange 30,000 packets of biryani for his guests. He met splinter groups of Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind and All Bengal Imam Muezzin Association.“The main programme will start at noon. The Quran will be read for two hours.

""Derogatory"" BJP Hits Out at Revanth Reddy Over Remarks On Hindu Deities

NEW DELHI: Congress neta Sonia Gandhi Friday alleged that the main goal of BJP establishment is to erase Jawaharlal Nehru and to destroy the social, political and economic foundations on which India has been founded.She said the forces behind the drive against Nehru “belong to the ideology that had no role in our freedom movement, or in the making of our Constitution.” She said the same ideology fanned the atmosphere of hate which led to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi , and it continues to glorify Gandhi’s assassins. “It is an ideology with a bigoted and viciously communal outlook. Its approach to nationhood is based on stoking prejudices of all kinds,” she said.Sonia said it is natural that a monumental figure like Nehru’s life will be analysed and critiqued, but it has become a widespread practice to divorce Nehru from the challenges he faced and view him without a historical context.“While we welcome on-going analysis of his (Nehru) contributions, what is not acceptable is systematic attempt being made to denigrate, distort, and defame him. The sole objective of this is to not only diminish him as a personality, But also to demolish his multi-faceted legacy in a crude and self-serving attempt to rewrite history,” she added.","Congress neta sonia gandhi alleged that the main goal of bjp establishment is to erase jawaharlal nehru.
