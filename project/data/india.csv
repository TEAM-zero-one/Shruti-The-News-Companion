The Truth Behind Curtailed Vande Mataram : Politics, Unity And A Century Of Cultural Tension

Modi: Nehru compromised instead of taking on Jinnah

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi Monday accused Congress of betraying ‘ Vande Mataram ’ and bowing to pressure from Mohammed Ali Jinnah to “divide” it despite Mahatma Gandhi’s praise that the patriotic song had become like a national anthem , saying the party meted out the “grave injustice” due to its appeasement politics.Initiating a discussion in Lok Sabha on the national song’s 150th anniversary, Modi traced its evolution to becoming a rallying cry for patriots and unifying spirit against the British rule, including in the popular agitation against Bengal’s division in 1905.He said Gandhi, who then practised law in South Africa, had recognised its immense appeal in Bengal. Quoting Gandhi’s statements on the song in a weekly, Indian Opinion, in 1905, Modi said: “it is so popular that (it is almost) as if it has become our national anthem. Its sentiments are great, and it is sweeter than anthems of other nations. Its sole motive is to ignite the patriotic spirit in us. It sees India as mother and worships her”.If it was such a great song, then why was it betrayed in the last century?” asked PM Narendra Modi before taking aim at first PM Jawaharlal Nehru. “Which were the forces whose wishes prevailed on the sentiments of revered Bapu? A sacred song like ‘Vande Mataram’ was dragged into controversy,” he said, in reference to Congress’s decision in 1937 to confine its recital to the first two paras.The current generation must know the reasons behind the betrayal of a song which had frightened the British so much that they banned it and repressed those who chanted it as a nationalist slogan. He also took a swipe at Trinamool Congress, saying parties having Congress in their name keep raising controversy around the song, which often draws criticism from a section of Muslims for its vivid Hindu themes, including invocation of deities. Modi appeared to be responding to critics, who have found the song’s imagery of nation as agoddess objectionable, with a strong articulation of cultural nationalism, a foundational guide to the Sangh Parivar, as he noted that even the Vedas have visualised India as a mother.Modi’s over 55-minute speech was heard without any serious disruption, and he made a concession to TMC MP Saugata Roy when the latter rose to object to his use of ‘da’ and not the more respectful ‘babu’ after the songwriter Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s first name, thanking him for the suggestion. Modi used the suffix “babu” for Bankim from that point onwards.With the song’s association with Bengali icons like Bankim Chandra Chatterjee and Rabindra Nath Tagore, who set it to music, BJP hopes to deepen its connect with the people of West Bengal, which goes to the polls in a few months, as it takes on CM Mamata Banerjee-headed Trinamool which has often championed its regional identity to corner its main rival.Modi said when Jinnah protested on Oct 15, 1937, against the song, which was sung in Congress sessions, Nehru, as the president of his party, felt insecure and “agreed” with the Muslim League leader’s criticism by writing to Subhas Chandra Bose that its Anandmath background may irritate and provoke Muslims. Nehru compromised instead of taking on Jinnah and the Congress, at its Kolkata session on Oct 26 pruned the song to its first two paras, he said, hammering home the irony of that conclave being organised in Chatterjee’s state.He added, “History is witness that Congress bowed down to Muslim League. Due to its appeasement politics, Congress bent to divide Vande Mataram, and that is why it had to bow down to the division of India later.”With the national song a fixture at BJP events, Modi said his party owed a debt to Vande Mataram that it needed to repay by ensuring it got its due.","Pm narendra modi accused congress of betraying ‘ vande mataram ’ and bowing to pressure from mohammed ali jinnah to “divide” it.

NEW DELHI: Banking regulator RBI and the country's largest PSU bank SBI Monday told Supreme Court it was not possible to give personal hearings to account holders before declaring an account fraud in view of the massive number of banking frauds.The country witnessed 60,000 cases of bank fraud in the last two financial years involving Rs 48,244 crore, the financial institutions said.Responding to query of a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan on why personal hearings cannot be given before declaring an account fraud which is part of natural justice, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for SBI, said the number of bank frauds had been alarming in recent years and any personal or oral hearing would derail the entire process of declaring an account fraud.He said the number of bank frauds was 23,953 in FY 2024-25 and 36,060 in FY 2023-24. The amount involved was Rs 36,014 crore in 2024-25, which was a 194% jump from Rs 12,230 crore in the previous year. Mehta said no bank gives personal hearings as it may defeat the very purpose of declaring the account to be a fraud. He argued that banks may have to encounter situations by which it would not be possible to afford oral hearing or personal hearing to the parties concerned.RBI also told the bench it had not issued any circular for making personal hearings mandatory in declaring an account fraud. The lawyer appearing for RBI said operationally it would not be feasible to do so, and if it is made mandatory, then bankers would have to spend more time on granting personal hearings than doing banking operations. He said RBI left it to the wisdom of banks to take a call, and everything cannot be micromanaged by the regulator. The bench, however, said there may be situations where personal hearing should be given for which there are no guidelines.In 2023, SC held that the principles of natural justice demand that borrowers must be served a notice and given an opportunity to explain the conclusions of the forensic audit report before their account is classified as fraud under the Master Directions on Frauds. In addition, the decision classifying the borrower's account as fraudulent must be made by a reasoned order. After the verdict, the controversy arose whether personal hearings needed to be given or written response filed by account holder was enough before declaring an fraudulent account.","The country witnessed 60,000 cases of bank fraud in the last two financial years involving rs 48,244 crore.

SC had began its journey as a protector of environment in a petition filed by retired forest officer T N Godavarman Thirumalpad in 1995 seeking protection of the Nilgiri forests from illegal felling of trees, and in the span of three decades, it has protected northeastern forests, Kashmir Khair trees, Aravalli hills, Western Ghats, Saranda forest, sanctuaries and stopped illegal stone quarries and mining.On Monday, the case related to the protection of Sukhna Lake in Chandigarh triggered the rethink on the part of SC. A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi castigated the Haryana and Punjab govts for being in collusion with real estate agents to allow rapid urbanisation around the water body to throttle its catchment area.However, it said Punjab and Haryana HC, which is just 500 metres from the lake, would be better placed to gauge the local situation and pass appropriate orders. It asked amicus curiae and senior advocate K Parameshwar, additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, and representative of the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) to identify localised issues raised in a large number of petitions pending before the green bench.The cases involving local issues should be dealt with by HCs concerned, the bench said, adding, ""We cannot sit here in Delhi and usurp the jurisdiction and wisdom of HCs, which are in a better position to handle the issues raised.Moreover, local environmentalists may not always be able to travel to Delhi to present the views of the local population. HCs would be in a much better position to consider views of local people. ""Petitioner Thirumalpad passed away on June 1, 2016, at the age of 86. In his 1995 petition, he had moved SC being distressed by the systematic destruction of pristine forests in Gudalur in the Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu. On Dec 12, 1996, a bench led by then CJI J S Verma passed an interim order stopping felling of trees and all non-forest activities across the country.Senior advocate Harish Salve was appointed amicus curiae.

Not about AI, but

fabrication of case laws

: Senior advocate

NEW DELHI: In the first instance of misuse of artificial intelligence in the judicial process - detected in Supreme Court - a litigant took the help of AI tools to draft a response that contained hundreds of fake cases. Taking cognisance of the matter, SC said it could not brush it aside but would hear the case on merit.Appearing before a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and A G Masih, senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul said a rejoinder filed in the court cited many cases which are all fake and not part of any judicial record. He alleged that some of these cases were correctly mentioned but the questions of law, which were decided in these cases, were misreported. Senior advocate C A Sundaram, appearing for Gstaad Hotels Bengaluru promoter Deepak Raheja, admitted it was a mistake, saying, ""I have never been more embarrassed. ""Sundaram read out an affidavit filed by the filing advocate in the case.Senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul, appearing for Omkara Asset Reconstruction, said the rejoinder submitted by Gstaad Hotels Bengaluru promoter Deepak Raheja was prepared using AI tools and fabricated cases were cited to convince the court in his favour.Kaul submitted that the erring party was not entitled to be heard after the grave mistake. ""Fake case laws were invented using AI tools and questions of laws, which were decided by the court, were fabricated by using AI. It is not about AI, but fabrication of case laws and concoction of points of law,"" he said. It would be difficult for a bench to detect falsehood as it is supposed to hear 70-80 cases, and if the court relies on the AI-generated falsehood, then it would be disastrous for the judicial system, he added.Sundaram said that he was in complete agreement with Kaul on this issue and told the bench that it was a terrible error committed in court.Reading out the affidavit - filed by the advocate-on-record (AoR), who is responsible for filing any document in SC - Sundaram said the lawyer tendered unconditional apology and assured SC that he would be cautious in future not to repeat the mistake. He sought permission to withdraw the response. ""We cannot simply brush it aside,"" the court said, and asked why the AoR should take the blame as the response said very clearly that the affidavit was drafted under the guidance of the litigant. SC, thereafter, went ahead hearing the case on merit.The controversy revolves around a high-profile case between Omkara Assets Reconstruction Private Limited and Gstaad Hotels Private Limited. The case went to SC following the hearing in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).","The supreme court encountered its first ai misuse case where a litigant submitted a response with hundreds of fabricated legal precedents.

Current situation:

NEW DELHI: Under fire for its handling of the IndiGo crisis, govt said on Monday it would set an ""example"" for other airlines with ""very, very strict action"" against the budget carrier once the probe into the massive flight disruptions is complete. The unprecedented disruption was caused by an ""internal crisis"" in the airline, Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said in the Rajya Sabha Monday.Also, with the duopoly situation - Air India Group and IndiGo - being blamed for making the bad situation even worse, Naidu said India needs more airlines. ""We have envisioned the demand to be growing at such a rate that we want to have more airlines in the picture... India today has the capacity of five big airlines. We are talking about two airlines, but the capacity, the demand that India is creating, we need to have five big airlines,"" he said, adding that this was ""the time to start an airline in India"". Naidu said govt wants ""more pillars"" in the industry to counter concentration and build resilience. ""There is so much growth that is happening. So let us all encourage more airlines to come into this industry along with govt,"" he said.""We are not taking this situation easily. We are conducting an inquiry... Revised flight duty time limitation (FDTL) was introduced after an April 2025 HC order. Of the 22 guidelines, 15 were implemented on July 1 and remaining seven on Nov 1. Multiple consultations were held with all stakeholders, including IndiGo, and rules had to be followed without any compromise on safety,"" Naidu said.The DGCA ""has been in continuous discussions with airlines since FDTL came fully into force, and had granted limited exemptions based on operational variations and safety assessments"", he said. The crisis erupted ""almost one whole month"" after the Nov 1 implementation and IndiGo did not flag any imminent issues during a meeting with the ministry on Dec 1. ""This is a day-to-day operation, something that IndiGo should have maintained. .. We care for pilots, crew and passengers. We made it clear to all the airlines. IndiGo was supposed to manage the crew and roster. Passengers faced a lot of difficulties. We are not taking the situation lightly.""IndiGo is fast returning to near normal, with the airline saying it expected to operate over 1,800 flights on Monday. ""We have optimised our operations and managed to reduce the number of cancellations which are being notified to customers in advance. Our on-time performance has improved to 91% across the network.""Rs 827 crore already refunded, and the rest is under process for cancellations up to Dec 15, 2025.

NEW DELHI: In a rare decision aimed at facilitating the education of a minor girl, Supreme Court on Monday approved issuance of an SC certificate based on the 'Adi Dravida' caste of her mother, who is married to a non-SC person, even though it is yet to adjudicate a bunch of petitions challenging the norm that a child inherits their father's caste.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi refused to entertain a challenge to a Madras HC order directing grant of SC caste certificate to the Puducherry girl on the sole ground that her academic career may suffer without it.""We are keeping the question of law open,"" the bench said. However, what the CJI said next could lead to a big debate. He said, ""With changing times, why should a caste certificate be not issued based on the mother's caste?"" This would mean that children born of the marriage of an SC woman with an upper caste man and brought up in upper-caste family environs would also be entitled to an SC certificate.The mother had requested the tahsildar to grant SC certificates to her three children - two daughters and a son - based on her caste certificate as her husband had stayed at her parents' house since their marriage. In her application, she had contended that her parents and grandparents belonged to Hindu Adi Dravida community.The presidential notifications of Mar 5, 1964, and Feb 17, 2002, read with instructions of the Union ministry of home affairs, say that a person's eligibility to get a caste certificate is primarily based on their father's caste as well as his residential status in the state or UT's jurisdiction.In Punit Rai Vs Dinesh Chaudhary [(2003) 8 SCC 204], a case relating to reservation, SC had said that the decisive factor for determination of caste of a person will be the caste of the father as per customary Hindu Law and that in the absence of statutory law, they would inherit their caste from the father and not the mother.In the 2012 judgment in 'Rameshbhai Dabhai Naika vs Gujarat', a two-judge bench of SC ruled, ""The determination of caste of a person born of an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal cannot be determined in complete disregard of attending facts of the case."" It said, ""In an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal, there may be a presumption the child has the caste of the father. This presumption may be stronger in the case where in the inter-caste marriage or a marriage between tribal and non-tribal, the husband belongs to a forward caste.""""But by no means is the presumption conclusive or irrebuttable, and it is open to the child of such marriage to lead evidence to show he/she was brought up by the mother who belonged to SC/ST. By virtue of being the son of a forward caste father, he did not have any advantageous start in life but on the contrary suffered the deprivations, indignities, humiliations and handicaps like any other member of the community to which his/her mother belonged. Additionally, he was always treated as a member of the community to which her mother belonged not only by that community but by people outside the community as well,"" it said.",Sc had earlier held father's caste as decisive factor in caste determination.

NEW DELHI: Police on Monday detained another manager linked to the tragic Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub fire in Goa that claimed 25 lives.The accused was identified as Bharat. According to police, he used to run daily operation of Birch by Romeo Lane at the club.The owner of Birch by Romeo Lane, Saurabh Luthra, remains absconding following the devastating fire at his Arpora nightclub on Saturday night, which claimed 25 lives and injured six others.Until last year, Luthra had aimed to launch 50 restaurants across India, but his weekend property turned into the site of one of Goa’s worst nightlife tragedies.Luthra’s LinkedIn profile lists him as ‘Chairman at Romeo Lane, Birch and Mama’s Buoi’. Activist Tahir Noronha described him as “like a ghost,” saying he rarely stays in Goa and often avoids legal proceedings, sending representatives in his place.“He is out of touch with the impact of his ventures,” Noronha said. Socialites and staff also described him as aloof; Jayesh Diukar, a kitchen staffer who survived the fire, said Luthra visited the club only once a month and rarely interacted with employees.At least 100-200 persons were on the dance floor of a nightclub in North Goa when a fire broke out there, and in an attempt to escape, some of them ran downstairs to its kitchen where they got trapped along with the staff.While the state police said the blaze occurred at the nightclub due to a cylinder blast after midnight on Sunday, some of the eyewitnesses claimed the fire started on the club's first floor, where tourists were dancing.Most of the dead were the club's kitchen workers, and included three women, chief minister Pramod Sawant said. There were “three to four tourists” among those killed, he added.""There was a sudden commotion as the flames started erupting.

GOA: Another harrowing video has emerged from Goa showing the moment a fire broke out at a popular nightclub, capturing guests fleeing for their lives.The blaze occurred late on Saturday at Birch by Romeo Lane in Arpora during a belly-dance performance.In the footage, flames can be seen spreading rapidly across the first-floor dance area, sending people scrambling in panic.Smoke quickly filled the club, forcing some guests to flee to the basement kitchen, where 23 victims suffocated. Two others were later found on a staircase.Around 150 people were present in the DJ and dance area at the time. Initial investigations suggest the fire was triggered by electric firecrackers striking the wooden ceiling, rather than a gas cylinder, which had been speculated earlier.The victims included 20 staff members from various Indian states and Nepal, and five tourists.The club, situated on a salt pan with a single narrow access lane, had inadequate fire safety measures, which delayed rescue efforts. Authorities said it was operating without proper licences and violated building norms.Following the incident, four club staff members were arrested, and the owners, Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, have been named in an FIR for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. A police team has been dispatched to Delhi to serve arrest warrants.Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced compensation of ₹2 lakh for the next of kin of the deceased and Rs 50,000 for the injured.

NEW DLEHI: Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha, alleging that his recent speech during the Vande Mataram anniversary debate lacked ‘facts’ and historical details. While acknowledging the PM’s oratory, she said he “falls weak on the facts,” and went on to take a ""chronology"" jab at the government, describing how Vande Matram was introduced as the national song.Vadra questioned why the PM did not mention that “in 1896 Rabindranath Tagore sang Vande Mataram for the first time at a Congress convention,” asking, “was it Hindu Mahasabha, was it RSS, what were you attempting to hide that it was a Congress convention?”Recounting the song’s origins, she said Bankim Chattopadhyay wrote the first two stanzas in 1875, followed by the publication of Anandamath in 1882, which included additional stanzas. She noted that Vande Mataram emerged as a symbol of unity during the 1905 anti-partition movement of Bengal, when “stalwart freedom fighters like Rabindranath Tagore hit the street singing the songs.”""Soon, people from all walks of life started singing. Understand the power of this song - Britishers used to dread the song, our bravehearts used to find strength after listening to the song to fight the Raj.The song invokes the feeling of dying for the motherland - this is the real power of this song,"" she said.Also read: 'Only two reasons' - Priyanka Gandhi targets government over Vande Matram debate; brings in 'Bengal election' Vadra argued that the song became politicised in the 1930s amid rising communal divides. She then criticised the PM for selectively quoting correspondence between Subhas Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru.She said that ahead of the 1937 Congress convention in Kolkata, Bose wrote to Nehru on October 17, stating, “We shall have a talk in Calcutta, and also discuss the question in the working committee if you bring it up there. I have written to Dr Tagore to discuss the matter with you when you visit Shanti Niketan.”According to her, Nehru’s reply on October 20 included more than the line read by the PM. She quoted Nehru as saying, “There is no doubt that the present outcry against Vande Mataram is to a large extent manufactured by the communalists… whatever we do, we can’t pander to communalist feelings.”Vadra added that after Tagore met Nehru, Tagore wrote that he supported separating the first two stanzas, noting their deep significance and warning that the later additions “can be misconstrued as communal.”She said that on October 28, the Congress Working Committee, with Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, Sardar Patel and Tagore present, declared the first two stanzas of Vande Mataram as the national song.She went on to say, “When in 1950, Dr Rajendra Prasad in constituent assembly announced the song as our national song almost all of these leaders were present and along with them was Dr Ambedkar and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee but no one had an issue with it.”She accused the ruling dispensation of revealing an anti-constitution mindset by questioning Vande Matram’s current form.“Questioning the current form of Vande Matram isn’t just insulting to all those stalwarts who in their great wisdom took this decision but it also reveals an anti-constitutional mentality. Are the treasury benches so arrogant to think of themselves as bigger than Gandhi, Tagore, Maulana Azad, Neta ji Bose, Rajendra Prasad?” she said.She went on to add, “The PM's statement that the national song was cut by an anti-national ideology is an insult to all those great leaders, those who devoted their entire lives to the freedom struggle. By accusing them of dividing Vande Matram you’re accusing the entire constituent assembly. This is a direct attack on our constituent assembly and our constitution.”Vadra later defended Nehru and recounted his contribution to the state, asserting if he would not have laid the foundation of multiple institutions like IITs and AIIMS, how would we have become Vikshit Bharat.“Insofar Jawaharlal Nehru is considered, for as long the PM Modi has been the Prime Minister, that’s 12-years, Nehru spent that much time in jail for what? For the independence of the country, and after that 17-years as the country's PM. You criticise him but if he wouldn’t have established ISRO your Mangalyan wouldn’t be there, if there was no DRDO your Tejas wouldn’t exist, if he wouldn’t have established IITs and IIM’s, then would not have led in IT…if he wouldn’t have established the institutions which you’re selling today, so would this Viksit Bharat exist? Pandit Nehru lived for the country and died serving this nation. ”Earlier in the day opening the debate on Vande Matram PM Modi told the Lok Sabha that “Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru wrote a letter to Subhash Chandra Bose after Jinnah’s opposition to Vande Mataram, stating that he had read the background of Vande Mataram and thought it might provoke and irritate Muslims. He added that they would examine the use of Vande Mataram, and that too in Bankim Chandra’s Bengal.”Setting the debate in the context of what he described as the Congress’ past compromises with the Muslim League, the Prime Minister argued that the party had weakened the song’s legacy and “fragmented” it, undermining the sentiments of the freedom movement.He said the decisive moment came on October 26 that year. “The Vande Mataram song was sung. But it is the misfortune of the country that on October 26, the Congress compromised on Vande Mataram. Vande Mataram ke tukde kardiye. That decision was a failure, a betrayal,” he said, adding that the Congress “bowed to the Muslim League and decided to fragment Vande Mataram.”",Congress mp priyanka gandhi vadra targeted prime minister narendra modi in the lok sabha.

Da or Babu?

NEW DELHI: All India Trinamool Congress MP Sugata Roy on Monday interrupted Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his address on Vande Mataram in the Lok Sabha over the choice of words he used to refer to the composer of the national song, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee.During his speech, the Prime Minister, on one occasion, referred to Bankim Chandra Chatterjee as “Bankim Da.” Roy immediately objected to the remark and said that PM Modi should use “Bankim Babu” instead.PM Modi quickly corrected himself and said, “I will say Bankim Babu. Thank you, I respect your sentiments.”“Can I call you dada, or is that also an issue?” he added.In the Bengali language, “Da” is the short form of “dada,” meaning elder brother. It is also used informally for someone older in a friendly way.On the other hand, “Babu” is a more formal and respectable suffix used for educated, respected gentlemen. At times, it is also used sarcastically to refer to the Bhadralok Bengalis who adapted to British culture.In the 10-hour discussion on Vande Mataram in Parliament, PM Modi recounted how Vande Mataram had become synonymous with India’s struggle against colonial rule.“When they divided Bengal in 1905, Vande Mataram stood like a rock,” he said, adding that “Vande Mataram also showed India the path to self-reliance. Back then, from matchboxes to large ships, ‘Vande Mataram’ was written as a tradition. It became a means to challenge foreign companies and emerged as a slogan of the Swadeshi movement.”He described the song as something far deeper than a political chant. “Vande Mataram was not just a mantra for political independence. It was not limited to our independence; it was way beyond that. The freedom movement was a war to free our motherland from the clutches of slavery... During our Vedas, it was said: This land is my mother, and I am the son of the soil.”PM Modi also invoked Mahatma Gandhi, telling the House, “In the weekly Indian Opinion on 2 December 1905, Mahatma Gandhi wrote that the song Vande Mataram, composed by Bankim Chandra, had become famous across Bengal... He wrote that this song was so popular it had become like our national anthem, carrying deeper emotions and more melody than the national songs of other countries.”The Prime Minister asked why the song suffered “injustice” in the last century. “Vande Mataram was so great, then why did injustice happen to it in the last century? Why was there betrayal with Vande Mataram? Which were those powers whose wishes overshadowed the emotions of Mahatma Gandhi?” he said, arguing that Congress’ compromises ultimately fed into the conditions that led to Partition. “Congress compromised on Vande Mataram and, as a result, had to accept the decision of the country’s Partition. ”PM Modi urged Parliament to treat the occasion as a moment of national reaffirmation. “Some great people of India dreamed of a free India, and today’s generation dreams of a prosperous India. The inspiration for both is Vande Mataram,” he said, adding that India must become “Aatmanirbhar and Viksit by 2047.”",Tmc opposes pm calling bankim chandra ‘da’; modi responds with 'babu' humour.

NEW DELHI: Congress party countered Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""appeasement"" charges against first Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru during the Vande Mataram debate in Lok Sabha on Monday.Terming PM Modi ""the Master Distorian"", Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh posed three questions.Speaking in the Lok Sabha after PM Modi's remarks, Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi accused PM Modi of blaming Nehru several times. ""Operation Sindoor - Pandit Nehru Ji's name 14 times and Congress's name 50 times. 75th Anniversary of the Constitution - Pandit Nehru Ji's name 10 times and Congress's name 26 times. 2022 President's Address - Pandit Nehru Ji's name 15 times. 2020 President's Address - Pandit Nehru Ji's name 20 time.

'Where Were Your Ancestors?' Gogoi Mocks BJP, Blasts Modi's Nehru Remark During Vande Mataram Debate

Vande Mataram

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused him of using his speech during the Lok Sabha discussion on “Vande Mataram” to “rewrite history” and give a “political colour” to the debate.During the day-long discussion on 150 years of Vande Mataram , Congress deputy leader Gaurav Gogoi said the prime minister has a “habit” of bringing up Jawaharlal Nehru and the Congress in almost every speech, irrespective of the issue.""It seemed that your political ancestors participated in various movements against the British.

When there was a discussion on the 75th anniversary of the Constitution, Nehru's name was taken 10 times and that of the Congress 26 times,"" Gogoi said.Gogoi asserted that “no matter how much the BJP tries, it will not be able to put a single blot on the contribution of Jawaharlal Nehru.”Gogoi claimed that it was the Congress that truly gave “Vande Mataram” the prominence it deserved, adding that his party ensured it was not reduced to a mere political slogan but accorded the status of the national song.Gogoi said that “it was in the 1896 Calcutta session of the Congress that Rabindranath Tagore first sang ‘Vande Mataram’.” He added that Tagore had even written to Jawaharlal Nehru, saying, “the privilege of originally setting the first stanza of Vande Mataram to the tune was mine when the author was still alive.”The Congress MP further added that in the 1905 Banaras session of the party, Sarala Devi Chaudhurani also sang “Vande Mataram.”""An important amendment was made in this song which was that of population. The original song mentioned 7 crore, but in 1905, during the Banaras session, Sarla Dev Chaudhurani made it 30 crore and turned the focus of the entire country to Vande Mataram,"" Gogoi said.He noted that it was the Muslim League that had called for boycotting Vande Mataram. He recalled that “Congress’ Maulana Azad said, ‘I have no problems with Vande Mataram’. That was the difference between the Congress and Mohammad Ali Jinnah.”Despite pressure from the League, he said, the Congress decided at its 1937 session that the first two stanzas of Vande Mataram would be sung at national gatherings. He added that although both the Muslim League and the Hindu Mahasabha opposed the move, the Congress chose to follow public sentiment rather than their diktat.The Lok Sabha on Monday opened a special discussion to mark 150 years of, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi initiating the debate and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh scheduled to conclude it.

NEW DELHI: A special discussion may have been held on 150 years of Vande Mataram on Monday, but the Bengal assembly elections - scheduled next year - took centre stage as slogans like ""Bihar ki jeet hamari hai, ab Bengal ki baari hai"" were raised by NDA MPs in the Parliament as Prime Minister Narendra Modi entered the House to initiate the debate.During the 10-hour discussion, while the ruling party invoked the Bengal partition and Bankim Chandra Chatterjee's legacy, the opposition accused the ruling party of holding the special discussion for its poll prospects in West Bengal.While opening the discussion in Lok Sabha, the Prime Minister recalled how Vande Mataram had become synonymous with India’s struggle against colonial rule.“When they divided Bengal in 1905, Vande Mataram stood like a rock,” he said, adding that “Vande Mataram also showed India the path to self-reliance.

Goa: 23 Killed In Arpora Nightclub Fire; Cylinder Blast Suspected, CM Sawant Vows Strict Action

Who is Saurabh Luthra ?







NEW DELHI: A packed nightclub in North Goa turned into a death trap after a massive fire broke out just after midnight on Sunday, killing 25 people and injuring six. The blaze ripped through Birch by Romeo Lane in Arpora, triggering panic among visitors and raising serious questions about illegal operations and safety violations.Police initially suspected a cylinder blast, but a tourist who survived claimed fireworks went off during a dance performance and were the likely cause. The deceased included four tourists and 14 staff members, while the identities of seven others were still being confirmed.Chief minister Pramod Sawant vowed strict action against officials who allowed the club to run despite safety violations, and police registered an FIR against the owners under various sections of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita.Police have registered an FIR against Saurabh Luthra and Gaurav Luthra, the owners of Birch by Romeo Lane, along with the nightclub’s manager and event organisers. The sarpanch of the Arpora–Nagoa panchayat, Roshan Redkar—who had issued a trade licence for the premises in 2013—has also been detained.Redkar said earlier in the day that the club was run by Saurabh Luthra, who had a dispute with his partner. “They had filed a complaint against each other with the panchayat.We had inspected the premises and found that they did not have the permission to construct the club,” he said.According to Saurabh's LinkedIn, he is the chairman of Birch by Romeo Lane, Mama’s Buoi, Romeo Lane, and Being GS Pvt Ltd. He has been active in the food and beverage industry for several years and has expanded his brand Romeo Lane to multiple cities and countries.Official website of Romeo Lane described Saurabh as a gold medalist engineer who became a “promising and fastest-growing restaurateur,” known for organic cocktails and strong public relations.

PM Modi quoted one line of this (Nehru's) reply here, but the rest of what Nehru ji wrote was - 'there is no doubt that the present outcry against Vande Mataram is to a large extent a manufactured one by the Communalists. Whatever we do, we cannot pander to Communalist feelings',"" Priyanka Gandhi said.Referring to Modi's speech, she said, ""Since you keep talking about Nehru, let's do one thing, let's assign a time for a discussion, list out all the insults against him... debate it and let's close the chapter once and for all,"" she said, adding that ""after that, let's talk about today's issues - price rise and unemployment...The topic that we are discussing is part of the soul of the country. When we mention 'Vande Mataram', it reminds us of the history of our freedom struggle. This debate is strange; this song has made a place in people's hearts; so what is the need for a debate?"" Priyanka said. In 1896, Rabindranath Tagore sang it for the first time at a Congress session, she said.She added questioning the decision of having the first two stanzas of 'Vande Mataram' as the national song was akin to questioning the Constituent Assembly and its members.Congress deputy leader in LS Gaurav Gogoi said it is the PM's habit to keep referring to Nehru and Congress whenever he speaks on any issue. ""He (Modi) took Nehru ji's name 14 times and that of Congress 50 times during the debate on Operation Sindoor. When there was a discussion on the 75th anniversary of the Constitution, Nehru's name was taken 10 times and that of Congress 26 times.""""During the discussion on the President's address in 2022, he took Nehru ji's name 15 times. The PM, during the discussion on the President's address in 2020, took Nehru ji's name 20 times. I want to say with utmost humility to Modi ji and his entire system, no matter how hard you try, you won't be able to put even a single blot on Pandit Nehru's contributions."" Gogoi said the PM's speech had two objectives - ""to rewrite history and give a political colour to this debate"".","'let's have debate on nehru, close that chapter: priyanka gandhi vadra' opposition parties say the debate is timed for the approaching west bengal assembly polls.

"Vande Mataram debate done with eye on Bengal poll, says TMC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vande-mataram-debate-done-with-eye-on-bengal-poll-says-tmc/articleshow/125847316.cms,"NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress claimed on Monday that the govt had pushed for a discussion on 'Vande Mataram' in the Parliament only with an eye on West Bengal elections, calling BJP's commitment to the national song a ""badly scripted comedy"".With BJP making a determined bid to unseat CM Mamata Banerjee, TMC MPs Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar and Mahua Moitra slammed the party for its ""divisive"" politics and for being removed from the state's soul, while SP's Akhilesh Yadav said BJP members are not ""rashtrawadi"" (nationalists) but ""rashtra vivadi"" (those who stoke dispute) and follow the British in dividing society.Praising the national song, Yadav said it had awakened millions and energised and unified the struggle against the British. BJP wants to own everything, including the icons who do not belong to it, he said. ""Going by their comments and speeches, it appears the song has been created by them,"" he said.Dastidar accused PM of insulting Bankim Chandra Chatterjee by referring to him as ""Bankim da"", giving the impression that ""he was having a casual conversation with the literary icon at a local tea shop"". Modi had switched to ""Bankim babu"" after another TMC MP, Saugata Roy, objected to it during his speech.Dastidar said Bengalis will not tolerate the belittling of Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, just as they had not tolerated the disrespect shown to Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar when his bust was vandalised.In her speech, Moitra said the irony of a discussion on the song is not lost on anyone when the opposition is preve-nted from raising pressing issues of national importance, like states being starved of funds due to them, pollution crisis, and people in large nu-mbers being subjected to ma-ss ""disenfranchisement"".","Tmc mps kakoli ghosh dastidar and mahua moitra slammed the party for its ""divisive"" politics.
