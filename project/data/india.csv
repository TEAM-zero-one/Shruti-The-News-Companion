'Undermining our region’s stability': PDP slams Omar Abdullah for calling to scrap Indus Waters Treaty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/undermining-our-regions-stability-pdp-slams-omar-abdullah-for-calling-to-scrap-indus-waters-treaty/articleshow/121244189.cms,"Omar Abdullah (left), and Mehbooba Mufti

NEW DELHI: The People's Democratic Party (PDP) on Saturday criticised Jammu & Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah for his recent comments about the Tulbul Navigation Project and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). The party said such remarks could affect the ""fragile"" peace and ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC).""Omar Abdullah’s remarks invoking the Tulbul Navigation Project and the control of water flow across the border are not just ill-timed but deeply irresponsible. At a moment when peace is fragile and the ceasefire is barely holding, such provocations only serve to inflame tensions,"" the PDP said in an official statement.The PDP also referred to a 2002 resolution on the IWT in the Jammu and Kashmir legislative council. It said, ""The resolution was moved by an NC MLC, not the PDP. It passed solely because the National Conference held a majority in the Upper House.""This response followed a recent exchange between Omar Abdullah and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti. The two leaders commented on the possible resumption of the Tulbul Navigation Project after the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty.The argument began when Abdullah posted on Thursday about restarting construction on the Tulbul Navigation Barrage at Wullar Lake. He wrote, ""The Wular lake in North Kashmir. The civil works you see in the video is the Tulbul Navigation Barrage. It was started in the early 1980s but had to be abandoned under pressure from Pakistan citing the Indus Water Treaty. Now that the IWT has been 'temporarily suspended' I wonder if we will be able to resume the project,"" on his X handle.Mufti shared Abdullah's post and replied, ""At a time when both nations have just stepped back from the brink of war—with Jammu and Kashmir once again paying the highest price through loss of innocent lives, destruction, and suffering—such provocative statements are deeply irresponsible.""Meanwhile, the PDP in its official statement described Abdullah’s comments on the IWT as ""dangerous and short-sighted."" It said such remarks could raise tensions and harm people especially in border areas.""Our position is clear: We continue to demand fair compensation under the treaty to Jammu and Kashmir, but the IWT must not be used as a pretext for war rhetoric,"" the PDP said.The party also said, ""Introducing contentious issues like the Tulbul Project or the abrogation of the IWT in today’s volatile climate only pushes both countries closer to further confrontation. Those in J&K advocating such positions are undermining our region’s stability, jeopardizing the lives of our people living in the border states who suffer most when conflict escalates, and, most importantly, India’s interests.""","The people's democratic party (pdp) criticised jammu & kashmir chief minister omar abdullah for his recent comments.

‘Jealousy?’ BJP asks why Cong didn’t pick Tharoor

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor ’s acceptance of the government nomination to lead a global outreach team , coming close on the heels of his comments about the conflict with Pakistan, including a defence of PM Modi government on the Pahalgam attack , and complaints at the Congress Working Committee meeting that he was straying from the party line, tantamount to daring the party, if not defying it.Congress has a lot to mull while deciding about Tharoor, crucial being the upcoming elections in Kerala where it is facing a tough challenge from the ruling Left front as well as from BJP’s bid to cut into Congress’s vote bank.In a democratic system, when individual MPs are sent on an official delegation, MPs should seek the concurrence of the party,” Jairam Ramesh said, calling it “dishonest” and “downright mischievous” for the government to request nominees after possibly deciding them on its own.However, its protest lost the sting with Tharoor gladly accepting the nomination. Formerly a senior functionary with the UN, Tharoor has also served as junior external affairs minister and was recommended by Congress last year to head the standing committee on foreign affairs. “It is an honour,” he said, adding that the issue involved national interest and should not be seen through the prism of partisan politics.Significantly,Congress’s partners in INDIA alliance — DMK ’s Kanimozhi and NCP ’s Supriya Sule — did not turn down invitations to be part of the delegations. Other delegations will be led by Ravi Shankar Prasad (BJP), Sanjay Jha (JDU), Shrikant Shinde (Shiv Sena) and Baijayant Panda (BJP).government had on Friday rejected Congress’s claim that it had the sole prerogative of deciding who from the party should be part of the delegations. “This has not to do with party politics,” minister for parliamentary affairs Kiren Rijiju is learnt to have told the Congress leadership, sources said.Congress’s stand drew an angry response from BJP. “ Congress choices to represent India at diplomatic meetings are not just intriguing — they are deeply questionable. Take, for instance, the inclusion of Syed Naseer Hussain. Let’s not forget — it was his supporter who raised ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogans inside the Vidhana Soudha while celebrating his Rajya Sabha victory. Bengaluru police arrested three individuals in connection with the incident...,” Amit Malviya, head of party’s IT cell, said on X. He added “the less said about Gaurav Gogoi, the better”, pointing out that the deputy leader of Congress in LS had spent 15 days in Pakistan, with his departure and arrival duly logged at the Attari crossing.Malviya also said, “No one can deny Shashi Tharoor’s eloquence, his long experience as a UN official, and his deep insights on matters of foreign policy. So why has the Congress Party — and Rahul Gandhi in particular — chosen not to nominate him. Is it insecurity? Jealousy? Or simply intolerance of anyone who outshines the ‘high command’?”","Congress has tough call to take as rift with shashi tharoor widens. ‘jealousy?’ bjp asks why cong didn’t pick tharoo to lead a global outreach team. “this has not to do with party politics,” minister for parliamentary affairs kiren rijiju is learnt to have told the congress leadership.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121244680,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1113637,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

BIJNOR: A 30-year-old constable died while attempting to rescue suspects after a high-speed chase ended with the criminals’ vehicle plunging into a canal near Bijnor city, reports Harveer Dabas.Despite suffering a electric shock upon entering the water, unknowingly electrified by live wires that had snapped during the crash, the constable managed to alert his colleagues to the danger, preventing further casualties, police said on Saturday.Officers said the suspects were celebrating the release of a friend from jail and were driving recklessly when they collided with a truck. Villagers alerted the police when the group assaulted the truck driver and fired at him.Bijnor SP Abhishek Jha said, “A police response vehicle and local units responded immediately, initiating a high-octane chase. The suspects’ vehicle sped along the Salmabad-Bharera road before crashing into a high-tension electric pole and plunging into a nearby canal, snapping the power wires that fell into the water.”He added, “Constable Manoj Kumar and head constable Gangaram dove into the canal to arrest the suspects. They didn’t know the water was electrified. The power supply was cut immediately, and the officers were pulled out and rushed to a hospital. Kumar, a native of Haiba village in Baghpat district, succumbed to his injuries while Gangaram remains hospitalised.”Praising the constable’s bravery, Jha said, “Manoj didn’t just risk his life but also saved six of his fellow officers. Even while suffering shock, he managed to alert them. His final act was one of true bravery.” Manoj joined the force in 2016. He is survived by his 28-year-old wife and their five-year-old son. On Saturday, officers from across the district gathered to honour him with a full police funeral.Meanwhile, police arrested one of the suspects, Neeraj Kumar — a history-sheeter with a prior attempt to murder charge — at the scene. Another accused, Veerbhan alias Veeru from Moradabad, was nabbed after a brief encounter.A country-made pistol, a live round and a spent cartridge were recovered from the spot. Two suspects are absconding, and legal proceedings are currently underway, officers said.","Cop dies while rescuing criminals after car plunges into canal near bijnor city.

HC upholds appointment of AMU’s 1st woman vice-chancellor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-upholds-appointment-of-amus-1st-woman-vice-chancellor/articleshow/121242119.cms,"Allahabad High Court has validated professor Naima Khatoon's appointment as Aligarh Muslim University's Vice-Chancellor, dismissing challenges to the selection process.

Khatoon says HC ruling reaffirmation of democratic values

AGRA: Dismissing all petitions that challenged the selection process, Allahabad high court upheld the appointment of professor Naima Khatoon as the vice-chancellor (VC) of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) on Saturday. Khatoon, who earlier served as principal of women’s college in AMU, became the first woman to hold the VC’s post in the varsity’s over 100-year history, reports Mohammad Dilshad.HC division bench of Justice Ashwani Kumar Mishra and Justice Donadi Ramesh found no procedural lapses, asserting the selection process adhered fully to the AMU Act, statutes and regulations. The court also emphasised the symbolic and progressive nature of her “historic appointment”, calling it a “major stride for gender representation and constitutional values in academic leadership”.The HC division bench of Justice Ashwani Kumar Mishra and Justice Donadi Ramesh further recognised that the “final discretion to appoint the VC lay with the ‘visitor’ of the university — the President of India, and no allegations of mala fide were established at that level”. The court had reserved the verdict on April 9 after hearing arguments from counsels representing the petitioner, AMU and the central govt.The petitions were filed in late 2023 by Prof Syed Afzal Murtaza Rizvi of Jamia Millia Islamia, Mujahid Beg from AMU’s medicine department and retired AMU prof M U Rabbani.They had raised objections after Khatoon, wife of then acting VC Mohd Gulrez, was “shortlisted” for the post.After HC’s decision, Khatoon, said, “I’ve always had the highest regard and faith in our judiciary. This verdict is not just a personal vindication, but a strong reaffirmation of institutional processes and democratic values in our higher education system. Let this judgment inspire confidence among all stakeholders and reaffirm our shared mission to uphold the university’s legacy of knowledge, justice and progress.”In Nov 2023, controversy erupted after the AMU’s executive council shortlisted “five eligible names”. An AMU professor wrote to the President, claiming “the process of selecting a new VC was not followed”. The ‘AMU court’ then forwarded three names, including that of Khatoon, to the ministry of education and the President, and the matter also went to HC.",Allahabad high court has validated professor naima khatoon's appointment as aligarh muslim university's vice-chancellor.

NEW DELHI: The Congress is once again under BJP fire. And once again, the ammunition for this all-out attack has been provided by a party leader. P Chidambaram 's reality check on the future of INDIA bloc has left the Congress scurrying for cover.""The future (of INDIA bloc) is not so bright, as Mritunjay Singh Yadav said. He seems to feel that the alliance is still intact, but I am not sure. It is only Salman (Khurshid) who can answer because he was part of the negotiating team for the INDIA bloc. If the alliance is totally intact, I will be very happy. But it shows at the seams that it is frayed,"" Chidambaram said at a book launch in the national capital on Thursday.He also hoped that the alliance can ""still be put together, there's still time"".The BJP, as expected, latched on to Chidambaram's remarks and unleashed a fierce offensive against the Congress. And why not? After all, the leadership of opposition's INDIA bloc is with the grand-old-party and Mallikarjun Kharge is its chairperson. So, Chidambaram's assessment points to failure of the Congress leadership to lead the opposition coalition effectively.Ironically, his remarks come at a time when the Congress was already struggling over statements made by Shashi Tharoor in support of PM Modi's policies during the India-Pakistan standoff. Several BJP leaders cited Tharoor's remarks praising several government's policies, including the ceasefire decision, to slam and school the Congress leadership.It was only yesterday that Congress leader Jairam Ramesh officially announced that Tharoor's remarks were his personal views. ""When Mr. Tharoor speaks, it is his view and it is not the stand of the party,"" Jairam Ramesh had said yesterday. Some reports citing Congress sources had suggested that the party had expressed displeasure with Tharoor's statements and was of the view that the Thiruvananthapuram MP had crossed the Lakshman Rekha this time around. However, Tharoor had dismissed these reports and called them ""media creation without any evidence.""Chidambaram's statement coming in this backdrop put the party once again on the backfoot.Citing Chidambaram's reality check, the BJP and its allies have been relentless in targeting the Congress and the INDIA bloc calling it a ""greed-driven coalition"", ""Maha-thagbandhan"", ""opportunistic alliance"", ""kushti-dosti model"", ""company of looters"", ""group of corrupt leaders"", ""ghamandiya alliance"". Some even raised questions on Congress's leadership role and claimed that the grand-old-party is fading and has no future.INDIA bloc, which was launched with a lot of fanfare, is actually gasping for breath today and to that extent Chidambaram is spot on in his assessment. But to announce that from a public platform definetely helps party's political rivals - the BJP in this case.It will be interesting to see how the Congress reacts to this new challenge. Party leader Udit Raj, who had slammed Tharoor for 'becoming BJP's spokesperson', had a word of advice for Chidambaram. ""Party has given him a lot. He and his son are MPs. Since the party is not in power, Chidambaram ji should go around the country and conduct a dialogue,"" he said.Tharoor has been at loggerheads with the party for some time now, but Chidambaram's remarks may have come as a surprise. Interestingly, last week when BJP national general secretary Radha Mohan Das Agrawal had slammed the Congress over demand to sack Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah for his controversial statement on Col Sofia Qureshi, he had cited both Tharoor and Chidambaram to prove his point.""If people start giving resignation for statements, then no one would be left in the Congress except for P Chidambaram and Shashi Tharoor. We should first demand Rahul Gandhi's resignation,"" the BJP general secretary had said. The fact that both these leaders have put Congress in a spot of bother may be a matter of coincidence. Perhaps.",Congress leader p chidambaram says the future of india bloc is not so bright. Bjp has latched on to the remarks and unleashed a fierce offensive against the congress. The party is already struggling over statements made by shashi tharoor.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121217659,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1338250,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

‘CCTV footage clearly shows how accused hit motorbike’

BENGALURU: A tiff over something as trivial as buying cigarettes triggered a road rage that led to the death of a software engineer in Bengaluru recently. One of his associates, also a techie, was injured after their bike was hit from behind by an SUV.Minutes before ramming the bike with his Creta, sales executive Prateek R (31) had been locked in heated arguments with Chetan (30) and Sanjay H N (29). Prateek had allegedly ordered the duo — total strangers — to buy him cigarettes from a pushcart as he pulled over on a road early on May 10, leading to the altercation. Both Sanjay and Chetan were injured when the SUV hit their bike, with the former succumbing to grievous head injuries May 13, three days after being hit.Prateek was arrested and booked for attempted murder initially, followed by a murder indictment after Sanjay’s death. “CCTV footage clearly shows how accused rammed into the bike,” DCP Lokesh Jagalasar said. He said the role of Prateek’s wife, who was accompanying him at that time, was also under the lens.Around 4am on May 10, Sanjay and Chetan were smoking and having tea at a roadside pushcart on Vasantapura Main Road when a Creta pulled up near the duo. Prateek shouted: “Get me four-five cigarettes.” Chetan told Prateek to get off and get the cigarettes himself. “Irked, he got off, abused us, and was about to hit me when Sanjay intervened & pushed him away,” Chetan said in his statement to the police.As Sanjay and Chetan hit the road, the SUV came charging from behind and rammed into their bike.

AGRA/DEHRADUN/HARIDWAR: As many as 90 Bangladeshi nationals, including 22 children, were taken into custody in Mathura district for allegedly staying in India illegally. The group was apprehended from brickyards in Khajpur village under Naujheel police station limits in the temple town. Separately, Uttarakhand police also arrested two foreign nationals — a US citizen and a Bangladeshi woman — during a verification drive.Acting on a tip-off received Friday, joint teams from Mathura’s Naujheel police station and the Local Intelligence Unit (LIU) conducted a raid and detained 37 men, 31 women, and 22 children. During the operation, police also seized 31 mobile phones, two Aadhaar cards, four photocopies of Aadhaar cards, and one PAN card.A senior Mathura police official involved in the probe told TOI, “During questioning, they told us they had arrived 10 to 15 years ago, crossing porous borders. After that, they moved around in Delhi, Haryana, Bihar etc. They were in Mathura for nearly 3–4 months, while some arrived 15–20 days ago in the city.

He also issued a notice to NTA directing it to submit its response by June 2.As per the candidates, 464 students wrote their exam at the Avadi centre between 2pm and 5pm on May 4. Heavy rain started around that time and power remained cut off from 3pm to 4.15pm. No power backup facility was arranged due to which the students had to write the exam under poor lighting conditions. Additionally, rainwater entered the exam hall, and students were asked to shift to another location, causing further disruptions. The candidates requested extra time to complete their exam but it was denied, their counsel told the court.Repeated requests for a re-examination were also not entertained. This violates students’ fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution, they said.",Madras hc on friday stayed declaration of neet-2025 results. 13 candidates’ pleas claiming that power outage at avadi examination centre near chennai had affected them.

"Congress livid as govt ignores its list for foreign outreach, picks Tharoor",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cong-livid-as-govt-ignores-its-list-for-foreign-outreach-picks-tharoor/articleshow/121241642.cms,"Congress leader Shashi Thaoor

Sparing before show of unity

For Congress, Tharoor is a nettlesome problem

Tewari’s name in outreach teams list could also be a challenge for Congress

NEW DELHI: On the day the Centre formally announced the composition of seven delegations of MPs to be sent to various countries to articulate India’s stance against terrorism and highlight ‘Operation Sindoor’, a row erupted Saturday over govt ignoring Congress ’s recommendations on who should be included from its ranks and, instead, choosing Shashi Tharoor — whom the party did not name — to head one of the delegations.Angry at the Centre naming Tharoor and not including three of four MPs it had recommended — Gaurav Gogoi, Syed Naseer Hussain and Raja Warring — Congress slammed the Modi govt for playing games” on a sensitive issue, and urged it not to politicise the delegations. From Congress’s list, only Anand Sharma has been picked.Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said party MPs included “at the instance of the Modi govt will, of course, go with the delegations and make their contributions”. He added, “INC will...not play partisan politics on national security issues, like BJP does.”Having been shocked by the Left the last time when Pinarayi Vijayan returned to office defying the state’s tradition of ejecting incumbent govts, Congress this time would like to consolidate its leaders to be able to put up a serious challenge as the leading opposition. Support for Shashi Tharoor among some UDF allies may also deter Congress.Recent events have been marked by a growing gulf between the restive MP and Congress, and the fresh confrontation could be the point where the party and Tharoor may have to take a call on their relationship — either Congress swallows its pride and accommodates its star MP or the latter chooses to break free. In between, there exists possibility of Tharoor being an isolated member within the party: something that the Thiruvananthapuram MP must have factored in before he justified his praise for ‘Operation Sindoor’ by saying it was patriotic thing to do.On Saturday, no sooner had govt released names of seven MPs leading global outreach on ‘Operation Sindoor’, which included Tharoor, than Congress released its list of four nominees submitted to the govt for the delegations that did not include Tharoor. The Thiruvananthapuram MP, however, went ahead by announcing that he was honoured to be leading the delegation, and that he would “not be found wanting” when summoned in national interest. Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh addressed the development with a jibe, “there is a difference in being in Congress and being of Congress”.It is ironic that the rumblings came barely a month after Tharoor took the central stage at the AICC session in Ahmedabad, where he was the first speaker on the political resolution introduced by Sachin Pilot . But some felt it was not so ironic after all because Tharoor in his brief speech had urged the party to be one of positivity and hope, and of solutions and not just counting problems, in what could be viewed as an advice to be prudent in picking battles against PM Narendra Modi and his party, BJP.If it comes to a breaking point after Tharoor having called his support for the govt decision over the party’s as “national interest”, Congress would be aware that BJP would use it to paint the arch rival in a negative light. Clearly, Congress has a nettlesome problem on its hands.After Shashi Tharoor, Congress may face more challenge if Chandigarh MP Manish Tewari is included in the all-party delegations that are to visit some foreign countries as part of govt’s global outreach on Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Sources close to Tewari said, “If the MP’s name is included in the all-party delegations, he will surely rise to the occasion to serve his nation and go with the delegation.”Meanwhile, former Union minister Anand Sharma has received a call from govt that he would be in the delegation. He is one of the four names recommended by Congress. Sharma said, “I received a call from minister (Kiren) Rijiju and I have accepted it as the nominee of Congress.”It is learnt that former minister Salman Khurshid is likely to back out if he figures in the final list. The fourth Congress leader that govt contacted, Punjab MP Amar Singh, may also skip. Neither of the four from Congress that govt contacted are in the shortlist that Rahul Gandhi has submitted to Union minister Kiren Rijiju.","For congress, tharoor is a nettlesome problem.

VADODARA: Police in Gujarat Saturday arrested the elder son of minister of state for panchayats Bachu Khabad in connection with an alleged Rs 71 crore scam tied to MGNREGS in Dahod district. Balwant Khabad was taken into custody near Bathwada toll plaza after weeks of evading arrest.Police alleged that he was linked to Shri Raj Construction Co, which received payments for supplying materials for Nrega projects despite not qualifying through bidding. His younger brother Kiran Khabad, connected to Shri Raj Traders, remains at large. Both firms received funds without securing contracts, police added.The scam, unearthed in April by Dahod’s district rural development authority (DRDA), involved 32 firms supplying materials in Devgadh Baria and Dhanpur talukas. None had emerged as lowest bidders, a requirement under procurement rules. DRDA’s inquiry revealed several projects were either never initiated or inflated, yet payments were cleared.Khabad, an OBC heavyweight of BJP and a four-term MLA, has not responded publicly to his son’s arrest. Balwant and Kiran had filed anticipatory bail applications in Dahod court but later withdrew them.Balwant and co-accused Darshit Patel, a taluka development officer currently posted in Kheda, were produced in Dahod court and remanded in police custody for five days. Patel was earlier posted in Devgadh Baria, one of the talukas named in the investigation.Seven people have been arrested so far in the scam, which came to light following multiple representations to DRDA, including Congress legislators. Leader of opposition Amit Chavda, of Congress, demanded formation of an SIT, alleging: “This scam could be much larger. Only an honest investigation can uncover full details.”","Balwant khabad was taken into custody near bathwada toll plaza after weeks of evading arrest.

"At 1.5 lakh, pedestrians made up 20% of road deaths in 5 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/at-1-5-lakh-pedestrians-made-up-20-of-road-deaths-in-5-years/articleshow/121241568.cms,"Nearly 1.5 lakh pedestrians died in India from 2019-2023, highlighting their vulnerability despite having right-of-way. A Supreme Court panel audit revealed that footpath availability varies widely across states, often not meeting standards. The court emphasized pedestrians' rights under Article 21, advocating for accessible, encroachment-free footpaths as a crucial, low-cost safety measure.

Just 3% of J&K roads have pavements

NEW DELHI: Despite having the first right on roads, pedestrians remain the most vulnerable user and data show that nearly 1.5 lakh of them died in road crashes in the country in from 2019-2023 out of the little over 7.9 lakh of all road fatalities during these years.While Supreme Court this week said that “rights of pedestrians to use footpaths are guaranteed under Article 21 of Constitution”, audits carried out in 24 states following a direction of an SC panel found that roads having footpaths across most states and UTs range between 19% and 73%, with Maharashtra having the maximum.Details of the audit findings were released recently by the Transportation Research and Injury Prevention Centre of Injury and IIT-Delhi in its report ‘India Status Report on Road Safety’. The availability of footpaths and whether these comply with the norms of width and height specified by the Indian Road Congress (IRC) were arrived at based on surveys across four cities in each state.As per the findings, in Jammu & Kashmir, barely 3% of the roads surveyed had footpath, and in the case of Puducherry, it was only 5%. In Bihar and Haryana, 19%-20% of roads had footpath. In most cases, footpath were not as per IRC norms.The apex court, in its order this week, observed, “It is necessary to have proper footpaths for citizens. They should be such that they should be accessible for persons with disabilities and removal of encroachments is mandatory. This court has recognised that the right of pedestrians to use footpaths is guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.”Amar Srivastava, who heads India Road Safety Campaign, a youth-led road safety movement, said that building proper footpaths and keeping them free for pedestrians is the most low cost intervention to prevent road crashes. “So, this should be the priority of every city administration and local govts,” he added.According to World Health Organisation, globally pedestrians make up 21% of road fatalities and in India, nearly one-fifth of people killed in road crashes in 2023 were walkers. WHO, last week, released a toolkit for promoting ‘walking and cycling’ for govt bodies as part of the ongoing UN Road Safety Week with the theme ‘make walking and cycling safe’, laying out why promoting walking and cycling should be the priority of govts for sustainable development and good health of people.","Nearly 1.5 lakh pedestrians died in india from 2019-2023, highlighting their vulnerability despite having right-of-way.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Friday said right to live in a pollution free atmosphere was a part of the fundamental right as it struck down Centre’s office memorandum allowing ex post facto or retrospective environmental clearances to projects in violation of norms.A bench comprising Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan made scathing remarks in its judgement delivered on a plea filed by Vanashakti organisation and said, “Union govt, as much as individual citizens, has a constitutional obligation to protect the environment.”The court said it “must come down very heavily” on Centre’s attempt to do “something which is completely prohibited under the law”. It added, “Cleverly, the words ex post facto have not been used, but without using those words, there is a provision to effectively grant ex post facto EC. The 2021 OM has been issued in violation of the decisions of this court….”The bench, therefore, declared the 2021 office memorandum (OM) and related circulars “arbitrary, illegal, and contrary to Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006”.
