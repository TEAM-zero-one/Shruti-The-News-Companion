NEW DELHI: Fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi has not paid maintenance charges of about Rs 63 lakh for his flat at Gokul Apartments in Malabar Hill, Mumbai, news agency ANI reported, quoting a society member on Monday.The member told ANI that Choksi owns three units in the building – on the 9th, 10th, and 11th floors – and has not paid maintenance for more than seven years.""He has seven years of maintenance due. He has three units– 9th, 10th, and 11th floors. The 11th floor is a terrace, he has illegally occupied it. There are maintenance dues of around Rs 63 lakh without interest. In 2020, our condominium had renovation work done, the cost per unit came to Rs 30-35 lakh, so if you add the cost of three units, it will be around Rs 95 lakh,"" the society member was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.""Big trees have started growing in the flat and the roots will definitely damage the structural integrity of the building. This is an additional burden that we have to bear without any fault of ours. We have faith in the legal system of India, ED officials, and we hope we will get the dues,"" he added.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had earlier attached the property.Earlier on Monday, the Belgian Federal Public Service of Justice confirmed that Mehul Choksi was arrested on April 12 and is currently in detention.

He is wanted by the CBI and the ED in connection with a case involving alleged fraud of Rs 13,850 crore at Punjab National Bank (PNB). Hisnephew, Nirav Modi is also accused in the same case.According to investigators, between 2014 and 2017, Choksi worked with his associates and some PNB officials to obtain letters of undertaking (LoU) and foreign letters of credit fraudulently, causing a loss of Rs 6,097.63 crore to the bank.The ED has attached or seized assets worth Rs 2,565.90 crore in the case against Choksi and the court has allowed ""monetisation"" of all these properties.","Fugitive businessman mehul choksi has not paid maintenance charges of about rs 63 lakh for his flat at gokul apartments in malabar hill, mumbai.

Emphasising how the use of advanced technology and modern means of communication have made crimes borderless, Amit Shah on Monday said the use of forensic science is crucial for speedy investigation and improving the conviction rate from the current 54% to, say, 94% in a few years. Addressing AllIndia Forensic Science Summit 2025, Shah said PM Modi was farsighted to visualise the growing importance of forensic sciences four years before the enactment of three new criminal laws, as he had set up NFSU in 2020. Stating that seven NFSU campuses have since been established in different states, with nine more coming up in next six months and 10 at the proposal stage, Shah said these will together churn out 36,000 trained forensic experts every year.","Amit shah said pm modi was farsighted to visualise the growing importance of forensic sciences four years before the enactment of three new criminal laws.

Sex between consenting married adults not a crime: HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sex-between-consenting-married-adults-not-a-crime-hc/articleshow/120293706.cms,"Representative Image

KOLKATA: A physical relationship between two married adults, if consensual since beginning, does not amount to luring somebody with a false promise of marriage and is not a criminal offence, Calcutta HC's Jalpaiguri circuit bench recently held.Justice Bibhas Ranjan De on Friday said: ""Both parties are married and aware of each other's marital status. Then, the consent given under such circumstances shall be deemed consensual rather than coerced or misled by a false promise, as the initial consent for a physical relationship will be perceived to be based on mutual attraction. It is expected that both parties be aware of their respective marital obligations.""Holding that the ""culpable mentality and clandestine motives"" of the accused are not made out in a complaint where a married woman accused a married man of luring her into an intimate relationship by a false promise of marriage, the judge quashed the proceedings against the man.The complaint was lodged on Sept 8, 2024, by the woman. The brief of the case is that the two married people were in an "" extramarital affair "" for two years. After the woman's husband came to know of it and refused to live with her, she asked to marry the man with whom she was having the affair.When the man refused, woman filed a case against him under Sections 69 (sexual intercourse by employing deceitful means) & 351(2) (criminal intimidation) of BNS at Maynaguri police station.","A physical relationship between two married adults, if consensual since beginning, does not amount to luring somebody with a false promise of marriage.

Ahead of the special cabinet meeting scheduled on Thursday to discuss the report in detail, senior netas from the influential Vokkaliga and Lingayat caste groups have called meetings of their respective communities. Both communities maintain that their respective proportions in total population is much more than what the report has estimated.Deputy CM and PCC chief DK Shivakumar called a special meeting of Congress MLAs from Vokkaliga community Tuesday to address their concerns. ""We will have a discussion with them (Vokkaliga legislators) and suggest ways to ensure everyone is respected without hurting anyone's sentiments,"" Shivakumar said, adding govt will not take any 'hasty decision'.Forest minister Eshwar Khandre, who is a Lingayat, said: ""The opinion of the community's leadership and individuals will be collated so that it can be conveyed at the meeting."" CM Siddaramaiah has maintained silence on the issue, stating, ""I will talk about it in special cabinet meeting.""The caste census report was submitted to the cabinet on April 10, but its contents have not been officially released to the public. According to the leaked findings, the Vokkaliga population stands at 61.6 lakh, or 10.3% of the state's population, with a proposed reservation of 7%. Lingayats are placed at 11% (66.3 lakh), with a recommendation of 8% reservation. However, internal community divisions - Veerashaiva Lingayats at 10.4 lakh, Panchamasalis at 10.7 lakh, and others - have led to disputes over accurate representation.The leaked report estimates the Muslim population at 75.2 lakh - or 12.6% of the state's total - and suggests doubling their reservation from 4% to 8%. ""This is higher than Vokkaliga community, which is currently considered the second-largest population group in the state,"" the report says.Expelled BJP member and Vijayapura MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal questioned the report's credibility and challenged the continued categorisation of Muslims as a minority.

Karnataka bid to breach 50% quota cap awaits tough judicial test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-bid-to-breach-50-quota-cap-awaits-tough-judicial-test/articleshow/120293178.cms,"Karnataka CM siddaramaiah

NEW DELHI: Any decision taken by the Karnataka government on increasing reservation on the basis of its caste census for socially and educationally backward communities and those who are inadequately represented will have a tough time passing judicial muster, as many such laws framed by other states have failed.Though Supreme Court, while upholding Centre's decision to provide 10% quota for economically weaker sections (EWS) by a 3-2 majority, had said ""50% cap on quota is not inflexible and inviolable for all times to come"", the controversial issue cannot be said to have been authoritatively adjudicated with the majority verdict adding a rider that the cap applied only to SC/ST/OBC reservation and the dissent verdict of two judges refusing to go into the issue of the cap as the matter was pending in court for adjudication in case of Tamil Nadu.""Reservation for EWS of citizens up to 10%, in addition to the existing reservations, does not result in violation of any essential feature of the Constitution and does not cause any damage to the basic structure of the Constitution on account of breach of the ceiling limit of 50% because that ceiling limit itself is not inflexible and in any case, applies only to the reservations envisaged by Articles 15(4), 15(5) and 16(4) of the Constitution,"" the majority verdict penned by Justice Dinesh Maheshwari had said.In a dissent note, Justice Ravindra Bhat had said he was not going into the question of violation of 50% rule as it was the principal ground of challenge on the validity of Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act, 1993, which was pending in court. ""The view of the members of this bench constituting the majority - that creation of another class which can be a recipient of up to 10% of reservation, over and above 50%, which is permitted under Articles 15(4) or 16(4), in my considered opinion, therefore, has a direct bearing on the likely outcome in the challenge in that proceeding,"" he had said.In a note of caution, Justice Bhat said if the ambit of reservation kept increasing, then the right to equality would be reduced to right to reservation and the observations of B R Ambedkar had to to be kept in mind that reservations were to be seen as temporary and exceptional or else they would ""eat up the rule of equality"".In a landmark judgment in Indra Sawhney case in 1992, SC had held that 50% quota shall be the rule and can be increased only in case of extraordinary situations ""inherent in the great diversity of this country and the people"".In recent years, many state govts attempted to breach the cap but they failed to pass judicial muster. On the basis of a caste census's findings, Bihar govt increased quota for reserved classes from 50% to 65%. However, Patna high court last year declared the law unconstitutional and the appeal against the HC ruling is pending in the SC which refused to stay the order.Chhattisgarh govt had also amended reservation rules, slashing the quota for Scheduled Castes by 4% (16% to 12%) and raising reservation for Scheduled Tribes by 12% - from 20% to 32%. OBC reservation was kept unchanged at 14%, taking the total reservation to 58%. But the HC in 2022 quashed the decision for breach of the cap.","Supreme court had said ""50% cap on quota is not inflexible and inviolable for all times to come"" many state govts attempted to breach the cap but they failed to pass judicial muster.

NEW DELHI: Jharkhand minister Hafizul Hassan ignited a massive political firestorm on Monday after the JMM leader said he prioritises Shariat over Constitution, and claimed that a Muslim ""keeps the Quran in his heart and the Constitution in his hand"".The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lashed out at Hassan calling his comments ""a blatant insult"" to Indian democracy.""For those who have Sharia in their hearts, the doors to Pakistan and Bangladesh are open. India will run only under the Constitution of Baba Saheb Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar and will remain supreme,"" the Jharkhand unit of BJP said in a post on X.Zubin Ashara, who serves as the state media co-head of Gujarat BJP, further accused the INDIA bloc of being packed with ""people who treat religious law as superior to the very foundation of our nation.""""A minister like Hassan Ansari saying Sharia outweighs the Indian Constitution is not boldness, it's a blatant insult to our democracy. INDI Alliance seems packed with such mindset people who treat religious law as superior to the very foundation of our nation,"" he said.On Sunday, Hassan speaking about the ongoing Waqf protests across the country said that a Muslim ""keeps the Quran in his heart and the Constitution in his hand.""Hassan, who serves as the minority affairs minister in the JMM-led government, accused the Central government of targeting Muslims in order to ""send them to jail.""“Waqf is not a new concept – it has existed for 1,400 years and continues today. Shariat is bigger for me. We keep Quran in our heart and the Constituion in our hand. A muslim keeps the Quran in his heart and Constitution in his hand. So we will first hold the Shariat and then the Constituion,” he said while speaking to a local news channel.He labelled the Waqf Act a “political stunt” by BJP, warning that within the next six months, the Centre would introduce laws targeting Christians and tribal communities. Hassan's comments come as the country is witnessing widespread protests with the agitation in West Bengal leading to over 150 arrests.“Muslims sabr mein hai kabr mein nahi (muslims are patient, but not dead),” Hassan said, adding, “If they push us too far, it will lead to massive unrest both in the country and globally.”Reacting to Jharkhand Minister Hafizul Hassan, BJP MP Manish Jaiswal hit out, saying such comments undermine India’s secular foundation. Jaiswal said Hassan should have taken office swearing on Shariat if he didn’t intend to uphold the Constitution, adding that India is a nation where people of all faiths coexist. He warned that allowing leaders to prioritise religious law over the Constitution could lead to anarchy.""I would also like to advise people who elect such people that this country runs on the Constitution. People with different faiths live here. If a Hindu or Christian says that this individual works as per Shariat and we won't listen to him, then there would be anarchy in the country. This is a secular nation which runs as per the Constitution,"" he said.Responding to criticism over his remark Hassan clarified that his words were being misrepresented. Hassan stressed that as a minister, he believes in and functions according to the Constitution, while also recognising the place of Shariat.""I did not say 'main' (I), I said 'hum' (we). Watch the full statement. I am a minister, 'hum' includes everyone. A minister believes in the Constitution and functions in accordance. Shariat too has its own place,"" the minister said.""People keep Lord Hanuman in their heart...it's a way of saying. I said something similar. Everyone is distorting it and presenting it.

However, it has triggered backlash, with parties like Congress, AIMIM, and AAP challenging it in the Supreme Court. They argue the bill could adversely affect waqf oversight.","The bharatiya janata party (bjp) lashed out at hassan calling his comments ""a blatant insult"" to indian democracy.

NEW DELHI: Fresh violence erupted in West Bengal on Monday when supporters of the Indian Secular Front (ISF) and police in South 24 Parganas clashed during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act.Violence erupted when police stopped ISF workers from marching to a rally at Kolkata’s Ramlila Maidan, where ISF leader and Bhangar MLA Naushad Siddique was due to speak.The protestors, many from Bhangar, Minakhan, and Sandeshkhali, were blocked at Bhojerhat on the Basanti Highway. Tensions rose when they tried to break through barricades, sparking violent clashes. Several police vehicles were torched and officers injured. Police used batons to disperse the crowd, leaving at least one ISF supporter with a head injury.""Some police vehicles were set on fire by the protesters and a few police personnel were injured when the agitators attacked the law enforcers,"" a senior police officer said.The violence brought traffic to a standstill, prompting a heavy police deployment. Protesters were eventually cleared from the area.This comes days after three people were killed in Murshidabad during violent protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act.

A special Calcutta high court bench ordered immediate deployment of central forces in Murshidabad following the unrest.Earlier today, West Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar visited a relief camp in Malda district, where hundreds of displaced families from Murshidabad have sought refuge after fleeing violence during protests over the Wakf Amendment Act. Majumdar, also the Union minister of state for education, visited the makeshift camp at Paralalpur High School in Kaliachak Block 3, where he interacted with the displaced families, many of whom were women and children. Local officials reported that 640 people have taken refuge in Malda, with 550 staying in the school and others in nearby villages.Majumdar shared that many women were deeply emotional, recounting how their homes were torched, property destroyed, and they received life threats. He alleged that ""fundamentalist forces"" disguised as protesters were behind the attacks in Dhulian, Murshidabad, which claimed three lives and left several injured.""Initially, 200-250 families had taken shelter here. Now, due to police pressure to shut down the camp and cover up Mamata Banerjee's failure, only 70-75 families remain. They are still living in fear,"" Majumdar alleged.""The situation in Murshidabad could be a precursor to similar unrest elsewhere in the state. Minister Siddiqullah Chowdhury has already issued a warning.

Shops are opening and people are slowly resuming their normal routine,” Shamim said, adding that law enforcement agencies are focused on restoring calm in the affected regions.Emphasising the need to curb misinformation, Shamim warned residents against spreading or acting on unverified news. “We’ve arrested 210 individuals so far. Rumours can reignite tensions — I urge everyone to stay calm and check facts before reacting,” he said.Referring to the brutal killing of a father and son, Shamim said a separate case would be filed and all persons involved - both perpetrators and bystanders - would be held accountable.""It will take time to identify them precisely, but no one will be spared,"" he asserted. Police made loudspeaker announcements across the district on Monday morning, appealing to shopkeepers to reopen and urging people to return to their regular lives.“Our top priority is restoring complete normalcy, and we are confident that Murshidabad will soon be back to peace,” Shamim added.On Saturday, the Calcutta high court ordered the immediate deployment of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) in the Murshidabad district, following deadly violence allegedly linked to protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act. At least three people died and over 100 were arrested in the escalating clashes that rocked the region.""The court cannot keep its eyes closed when such situations come up,"" a division bench led by Justice Soumen Sen observed, emphasizing the constitutional responsibility to ensure peace and protection for all citizens. The court was hearing an urgent petition on a court holiday, underscoring the gravity of the situation.","A petition was filed on monday in the supreme court seeking a court-monitored sit probe into the murshidabad violence.

Perspectives from the Muslim community

The political kerfuffle

What’s at stake

""People I know are getting divided into Hindu-Muslim right in front of my eyes,"" lamented Debangshu Bhattacharya , the young TMC leader who popularized the iconicslogan. When the youth gets disheartened, it is obvious that the situation is dire. Debangshu's Facebook post came on the backdrop of three deaths in violent protests in West Bengal’s Murshidabad over the Waqf Amendment Act. The violence that erupted on Friday, 11th April continued well into Saturday, prompting the Calcutta High Court to order central forces to be stationed in sensitive areas. With conspiracy theories swirling and familiar script of blame game playing out, an emotive issue has once again engulfed sensitive Indo-Bangladesh border districts. The assembly elections are just a year away, and the government is already battling high-profile scams—including the teacher recruitment controversy— in such a situation the political ramifications of such a livewire issue cannot be ignored.The Union Government’s decision to amend the Waqf Act of 1995 has ruffled feathers of sections of the minority community. Waqf refers to properties donated for charitable purposes. These properties, which cannot be sold, are overseen by a(custodian). Several clauses in the new Waqf Amendment Act—renamed the UMEED Act—haven't gone down well. These include the abolition of “Waqf by user,” inclusion of non-Muslims on Waqf Boards , a new requirement that donors must be practicing Muslims for at least five years and must own the property, provision to appeal tribunal orders in the High Court, and the formation of separate boards for different sects.West Bengal, which has over 80,480 Waqf properties—second only to Uttar Pradesh’s 2.2 lakh—has witnessed widespread protests. Nationally, Waqf Boards control 39 lakh acres of land, with 21 lakh acres added between 2013 and 2025, a figure the Union Home Minister claimed reflects past misuse. According to Amit Shah, speaking in the Parliament, the 2013 amendments were politically motivated, and the current changes aim to rectify that.The protests began sporadically but escalated violently on 11th April. Prior to that, a viral video showing a Kolkata bus driver being forced to remove a saffron flag under pressure from Waqf protesters had already sparked controversy.Additionally BJP had shared a clip where State Minister Siddiqullah Chowdhury, also the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hindi leader, was heard allegedly claiming that his supporters can easily choke Kolkata if required.Preempting unrest, Mamata Banerjee had made her stance clear on April 9, just a day after mobs attacked a police van in Jangipur, Murshidabad. “You have been hurt. Have faith. Nothing in Bengal will divide us. We must live and let live,” Mamata said in an outreach to the minority community. Outlining the historical significance of the Muslim community in the state, she pledged to give them steadfast support. However, it failed to soothe frayed nerves. Just a couple of days later, violence erupted in Samsherganj, Dhulian, and Suti of Murshidabad, leading to the deaths of three people, including a father and son.On the 12th, West Bengal CM gave out a measured message amidst news of violence. Without mentioning the Waqf Act or the Muslim community, she asked for calm and claimed that the legislation wouldn't be implemented in the state. She wondered why riots were being instigated. Mamata claimed that some political parties were trying to use this issue to further their agenda and requested people not to fall into their trap.While Mamata may have promised that the Waqf Act won't be implemented in the state, experts are divided over the constitutional validity of such a claim. Former Supreme Court Justice Ashok Kumar Ganguly, when contacted by TOI Online, said that what Mamata Banerjee is saying is 'unconstitutional.' According to the former justice, the CM has the right to move the Supreme Court but, until the court gives an order, the state has to obey the law passed by the Union Government. He cited Article 256 of the Constitution, which mandates,Hence, Mamata Banerjee has limited scope to not cooperate with the Union government, he argued. This view is also seconded by eminent lawyer and Rajya Sabha member from CPIM, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya. Bikash, who has just had a major legal victory over the state government in the SSC case—which led to 26,000 teachers losing their jobs—virtually laughed off CM's claim. He believes it was an irresponsible statement and didn't help cool tempers. According to Bikash, this was an issue that required community protest and not state government intervention.Practising Advocate in the Supreme Court, Nikhil Mehra had a more nuanced take. He told TOI Online that Mamata Banerjee may choose not to operationalise the Waqf Amendment Act. However, he laid out certain conditions—such as in cases where Waqf has acquired properties belonging to the central government, the state would have no authority if those properties are reclaimed. He emphasised that the law remains in force even if the state chooses not to operationalise it, and in the event of a change in regime, the incoming government would be in a position to enforce all its provisions effectively from the day it was signed by the President.In cases of land disputes, if the state is made a party, it raises the question of whether it can legally oppose the matter in court on the ground that the state will not enforce the Act, Advocate Mehra noted. He added that for Acts falling under the Concurrent List, a state can pass a contrary amendment—but only if it receives the President’s assent. West Bengal hasn't even attempted this because the President is unlikely to accept such an amendment.Beyond legalities, Banga Bhushan winner author Abul Bashar offered a cultural explanation, noting that donating to Waqf often serves as a workaround to the complexities of inheritance law. He defended Waqf Boards as essential support systems for widows, orphans, and the economically disadvantaged. While he endorsed peaceful protests, he warned against violence and urged Hindus to stand in solidarity. Bashar maintained that the protest is genuine and grounded in Islamic tenetsEducationist Miratun Nahar, when contacted, minced no words and said those who want to change the secular nature of the country have brought this act in a well-crafted and well-planned manner. For members of the Waqf Board, her appeal is to look for the welfare of the Board, the community, and the nation overall and not to fall into the trap of those who want to provoke. However, the veteran educationist reposed little faith in the politics of Mamata Banerjee and said that trusting her would be even more detrimental for the community.Trust, though, as a product, seems to be in short supply in West Bengal's politics. Days after the state government took BSF's help to get the situation under control, TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh made an outlandish claim in a press conference that some people may well have used BSF and other central agencies to bring 'outsiders' to foment communal tension in Murshidabad. Claiming to have received reports, Kunal Ghosh demanded a high-level probe to verify them. Despite over 150 arrests, the identity of the mastermind behind the riots remains unclear. The BSF has gone on record saying that petrol bombs were hurled towards them.According to BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari 's post on X, the elected lawmakers of TMC—who have won by ‘rigging’—have no agency, and hence the entire hardline forces in Murshidabad and Malda have shifted allegiance to PFI, SIMI, and ABT. The Leader of Opposition also gleefully shared an undated video on X where a Muslim individual is claiming that the community is not dependent on Mamata, but Didi (Mamata) is dependent on them for her political survival!Adhikari, who believes that CM should resign and elections should be held under President's Rule, has claimed that people from riot-affected Dhulian have crossed over to Baishnabnagar, Malda, fearing what he claims is ‘religious persecution.’Incidentally, TMC MP from Jangipur, Khalilur Rahaman, and Manirul Islam, MLA from Farakka, both have failed to pinpoint groups who were behind the attacks. Islam's house was attacked and ransacked in this violence. His family members had to take refuge elsewhere. Claiming that the police couldn't provide him security, Islam, like his colleague Khalilur, said that young boys were at the forefront of the attack. “If elected representatives are not safe, how can the common man be provided protection?” he told local media personnels.Union Minister Sukanta Majumdar has upped the ante, claiming on X that what is being witnessed is “Noakhali part 2,” a reference to pre-partition horrors. TMC, on its part, has gone into overdrive on social media, claiming that BJP is using fake images and videos to discredit the Mamata government and also to further divide society along communal lines.It is also highlighting the fact that violence has also erupted in Tripura over the Waqf protest, where BJP is in power. The saffron party in its part has cited the example of Assam with 40% minority where things have remained calm.What’s getting lost in this political mudslinging is the fact that Murshidabad is a district with 66.67% Muslim population according to the 2011 Census. The nearby district of Malda too has a Muslim population of over 50%. Both are districts bordering Bangladesh already witnessing political upheaval. Thus, discontent regarding the Waqf Act, if not tempered quickly, may continue to fester for long in these communally sensitive districts. The fact that TMC has not been traditionally strong here, only grabbing political power in recent years, makes Mamata’s job even more tricky. TMC organisation isn't particularly robust with many of the leaders' turncoats from other parties. The party will look to ensure that Muslims, who have been their dedicated voter base for over a decade in the state, don’t look for other options while also assuaging the sentiments of the majority Hindu community. That's the delicate balancing act Mamata led government has to do in the run up to the elections. The BJP will be itching to use incidents like Waqf riots to earn the confidence of the Hindu community, who so far have partially reposed faith in the Mamata government mainly due to its welfare schemes.All eyes are currently on April 16, when the CM is set to meet Muslim clerics to figure out a roadmap. On the same day, the Supreme Court will take up the Waqf case for hearing. A possible breakthrough on either front can cool down the temperature. Else, people of Bengal may have to brace for a heated political summer!","Waqf amendment act of 1995 has ruffled feathers of sections of the minority community.

Their families claimed armed mobs abducted them.

KOLKATA: Violence linked to the new waqf law escalated in Bengal on Monday, enveloping Bhangar on the outskirts of Kolkata as mobs took over the streets and unleashed a barrage of bricks that left at least 16 police officers wounded.The trigger for the street anarchy in Bhangar, a volatile pocket with a history of political violence, was police preventing Indian Secular Front (ISF) rallyists from heading to Kolkata's Ramlila ground for a rally against the waqf law, report Dwaipayan Ghosh & Sukumar Mahato.The sight of cops being outnumbered in Bhangar contrasted with a crackdown in flashpoint Murshidabad, where 11 FIRs were registered and the number of arrests exceeded 200.Police rounded up over 50 of the suspects in Murshidabad overnight, based on accounts of how mobs barged into homes since Friday night and targeted people. Suspension of internet was extended to pockets of Malda and Birbhum districts, contiguous to the strife-torn belts.One of the 11 FIRs was based on a complaint by Pompa Das, whose husband Chandan and septuagenarian father-in-law Hargodindo were among the three casualties in the communal violence. She described how a mob dragged the duo out of their home in Jatrapara and lynched them while the helpless family watched in horror from their rooftop.DGP Rajeev Kumar said the situation at Dhulian and other violence-ravaged parts of Murshidabad, which also reported 2 suspected abductions and injuries to many, was now ""fully under control"".CM Mamata Banerjee appealed ""with folded hands"" to all communities not to get provoked. ""Today, on the eve of Poila Baisakh, I urge everyone to peacefully exercise their democratic rights (to protest) with prior permission,"" the CM said.""But remember, whoever you are, A, B, C or D, do not take law in your own hands. Some people may instigate you but do not be provoked... They (her detractors) vilify me, going to the extent of even changing my surname. Which type of people would do this? Religion should not be used for playing irreligious games.""In Bhangar, the latest flashpoint of waqf protests on the outskirts of Kolkata, vehicles ferrying ISF supporters had been first stopped near Bairampur on Basanti highway. The stand-off escalated into violence as police allegedly used batons against the protesters. A similar attempt by cops from Bhangar division and Kolkata police reserve battalion at Shonpur in Bhangar fuelled the mob fury. Around 2,000-odd protesters later blocked Basanti highway for four hours. Lalbazar, Kolkata police headquarters, cited intelligence on ""ISF mobilising crowds"" as the reason for restricting gatherings in the city centre.At the Sealdah rally, ISF legislator Naushad Siddiqui questioned the police intervention. ""The CM has said the new waqf law won't be implemented in this state. We also don't want it to be implemented. That's why we organised the rally in Sealdah. Why did the police obstruct our workers from going there?""Mayor Firhad Hakim advised protesters to direct their actions towards Delhi. ""Why are they staging a drama here and inconveniencing people? When we take to the streets and block roads, it causes trouble for everyone. If you want to protest, the best thing to do is to organise a collective call to go to Delhi. Protests should be held where the waqf law has been implemented or will be implemented in those states,"" he further added.Violence was also reported Monday in Siliguri city of north Bengal, with a couple of RAF battalions being deployed in the Jyoti Nagar area after two groups clashed during the Charak festival. Police said that the conflict appeared to stem from ""a rumour"".",Violence linked to the new waqf law escalated in bengal on monday.
