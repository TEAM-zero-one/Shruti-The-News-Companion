As per the clause, the draft roll must be put on the chief electoral officer's (CEO) website in a text mode and no photographs shall appear against details of electors.

DHARAMSHALA/KULLU: Two bodies were pulled out from a debris-laden Manuni Khad stream near Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh, feared to be among 15-20 workers missing from a private hydroelectric project after a cloudburst unleashed flash floods at the site Wednesday afternoon.As the monsoon set in over the region, torrential rain battered Himachal - leading to swollen mountain streams and rivers washing away homes and vehicles. IMD has issued an orange alert for heavy rainfall in several districts.The workers had been staying in temporary shelters at the project site by the stream in Khanyara when a sudden surge overwhelmed the banks, sweeping away everything in its path.Videos show torrents of water hurtling down the valley, carrying driftwood, tree trunks and debris.""The bodies haven't been identified.

Yes, absolutely No, they're unnecessary





MUMBAI: Almost one-third of those who have died on the railway lines in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region over the past 15 years have remained unclaimed, an RTI response has revealed.The number of people who remained unidentified after losing their lives in train accidents on the suburban network make up 31% (14,513) of the total people (46,969) who died. They could not be restored to their next of kin despite efforts of the Govt Railway Police (GRP).Data obtained through the RTI plea by orthopaedic Dr Sarosh Mehta shows the percentage of unclaimed bodies started to rise from 2019 onward.Establishing the identity of a railway accident victim is challenging, said police personnel. Sometimes the bodies are mangled beyond recognition and belongings like phones or identity cards are not found.The GRP used to run a website called Shodh, where pictures of unidentified victims were put up along with their details and helped their families find them. But the project was wound up. The GRP also started a campaign where banners with pictures of accident victims were put up at railway stations in a bid to identify them, but passengers found them to be disturbing and they were taken off.""Typically when the victim's identity is not known, the body is kept at a morgue for 15 days to a month. The victim's photograph is sent to police stations across the metropolitan region to find out if a missing complaint has been registered by his/her family. If a claimant does not come forward, then the body is cremated or buried as per the victim's faith (if it is known),"" said a police officer. A piece of clothing or the victim's personal belongings are retained in the police records along with the victim's photo in case his/her family is traced later. Despite challenges, police teams sometimes track down the next of kin through tatoos on the victim's body or tags on his/her clothing.Dr Mehta said often the morgues are full and unclaimed bodies cannot be kept beyond a few days.Between 2002 and 2024, over 72,000 people lost their lives on railway lines due to various reasons, a majority run over while crossing tracks.Data shows overall fatalities have been decreasing every year since 2012. The only exception was 2022 when people stuck at home due to the pandemic started returning to work on the city's lifeline.Dr Mehta said that incidents like track crossing and falling off trains were preventable with measures like boundary walls and closed-door coaches.The Railways have been constructing foot over-bridges and installing escalators to discourage track crossing. But with the number of annual deaths still in four-figures, there is a long way to go to achieve the Railways' mission of zero deaths.","Almost one-third of those who have died on the railway lines in the mumbai metropolitan region over the past 15 years have remained unclaimed.

Bombay HC orders preservation of dead man's semen on mother's plea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-orders-preservation-of-dead-mans-semen-on-mothers-plea/articleshow/122100087.cms,"MUMBAI: Bombay high court has ordered a fertility centre to preserve the frozen semen of a deceased unmarried man pending hearing of a petition by his mother who wants to use it to continue the family line. The fertility centre had refused to release it to her.The woman's son had chosen to preserve his semen during chemotherapy. Justice Manish Pitale said if the semen sample is destroyed before the matter is decided, the purpose of the petition would be ""frustrated"".The mother's petition said when her son was diagnosed with cancer, the oncologist treating him had advised him to freeze his semen as chemotherapy caused fertility problems.Her son, without consulting family members, however, ticked an option to destroy the sample in the event of his death. He passed away on Feb 16 intestate.On Feb 24 and 26, emails were sent by the woman to Nova IVF Fertility Centre requesting them not to dispose of the semen sample and to provide access to transfer the sample to a Gujarat-based IVF centre for future course of action. On Feb 27, Nova declined to release the sample and asked the mother to obtain authorisation from court as per Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act and Rules.On April 1, the Maharashtra public health secretary wrote asking her to approach the national board. On May 6, the Union ministry of health and family welfare rejected her request. Thereafter, the mother moved HC. The sample was meant for storage till July 31.Her petition, submitted through advocates Nikhilesh Pote and Tanmay Jadhav, said the young man's family comprises only female relatives. His father died at 45 and his uncle at 21. ""Now the petitioner has lost S at a young age of 21...the petitioner intends to continue the family legacy through the deceased son's semen.""It said when her son was in a critical state and realised he did not have much time, he told his aunt to ""do something with the sperm and create his children who would take care of my mom and family"". Also, it is a settled legal position that ""sperm constitutes property and the parents are the legal heirs of the deceased son.""It said the form signed by the deceased youth had two columns - to 'perish' the sample or hand it over to the wife (if married).

Intitial information about causes leading to the accident is likely to be known in the next seven to 10 days.With the black boxes being examined locally, the final report is expected to be out in a month, instead of the six-month time frame given earlier, sources said. Civil aviation ministry said the crash protection module from the front black box was safely retrieved, and on Wednesday, the memory module was accessed.While the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) of AI-171 which crashed within minutes of take-off was recovered on June 13, the Flight Data Recorders (FDR) were found in the debris three days later. Like the earlier practice, this time too, there were plans to send the black boxes to the US for examination, especially as it involved the first Dreamliner crash. But on the suggestion of the top leadership, it was decided to send them to the AAIB lab, sources said.As a result, the two were flown to Delhi in separate Indian Air Force planes last Tuesday.""The analysis of CVR and FDR data is under way.

As he stepped out of his three-room house into the courtyard, he asked his daughter, Savita, a Class IX student, to bring out the cattle for grazing. Moments later, her shrieks sent a chill down his spine.Savita had found a seven-foot-long tiger inside their room - which had only one door - and screamed: ""Baba, baag... (Father, tiger)!""""All hell broke loose as my two other daughters and the relative were still sleeping inside,"" Puran told TOI over the phone. His wife and son were away to attend a wedding in a nearby village in West Bengal.""Savita rushed inside briefly to wake up the others. I also went in and asked the girls to run to the other side of the room,"" Puran said.""Soon, the tiger jumped into another room through a window that had no grille and stood there. I then asked the girls to run out of the house. As soon as we escaped, we locked the iron door from outside and called for help,"" Puran added.The big cat may have sneaked into the house early in the morning when Puran had gone to the courtyard leaving the door open. Instances of leopards and other wild animals straying into houses had earlier been reported in Jharkhand, but it was the first time that a tiger had strayed into someone's house.The news sent district authorities into a tizzy, and the forest department rushed a team to control the situation. Senior forest officials arrived at the spot to oversee the operation. The house was covered with nets, and prohibitory orders were imposed to check any gathering at the site. A local police officer told TOI that they had roped in additional personnel to prevent any unwanted incident. ""There was a crowd of nearly 1,000 villagers. .. it was a big task for us to ensure their safety,"" the officer said.Around 4pm, a special team from Palamu Tiger Reserve reached the village, and aided by personnel from Ranchi forest division, managed to trap the tiger - a male aged about five years. The team placed a cage, fitted to a rescue van, in front of the door and lured the big cat out. ""Even before placing the bait, the tiger entered the cage and got trapped. It was then tranquillized so that it wouldn't get injured. We had to dart it twice. Around 6.45pm, we left for Ranchi's Bhagwan Birsa Zoo where the tiger will undergo tests,"" an official said.Jharkhand's chief wildlife warden Paritosh Upadhyay said, ""If the tiger is fit, we will release it in a nearby tiger reserve with a radio collar in consultation with the National Tiger Conservation Authority.""The village is located on the banks of the Subarnarekha river, about 60km from Ranchi city and barely 500m from Purulia in West Bengal.

Tum Delhi mein bethkar Bihariyo ke naam par haste ho aur yaha bethkar gyan dete ho

Aap Bihariyo ko kehte ho ki vo paida hue hai mazduri karne ke liye aur phir yaha aakar bada-bada gyan doge

NEW DELHI: As Bihar braces for a high-stakes assembly election later this year, political sparring has intensified with Jan Suraaj Party chief Prashant Kishor taking direct aim at Rahul Gandhi , the leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha.In a sharp remark, Kishor questioned Gandhi’s commitment to Bihar and accused the Congress of decades-long neglect and tokenism.In a recent interview with news agency ANI, Kishor, who has been traversing Bihar’s rural interiors as part of his Jan Suraaj campaign, threw a gauntlet at the Congress leader, daring him to spend just a single night in a village in the state to demonstrate any real grassroots engagement.""Rahul ji keeps coming and going here, but doesn't really undertake any Yatra. If Rahul Gandhi has ever spent even one night in a village in Bihar, let us know. If he can spend just one night in a village, we'll accept it,"" Kishor said.(You sit in Delhi, laugh at Biharis then come here to lecture us),"" he added, underscoring what he described as a condescending attitude from the Congress high command.Kishor also turned his fire on Telangana chief minister Revanth Reddy for allegedly disparaging Biharis, demanding an apology and criticising the Congress party for enabling such attitudes.""In Telangana, their chief minister is Revanth Reddy, it's been two years since he became CM. Before that, he was in the TDP (Telugu Desam Party), and before that, he was in the RSS and the BJP. After becoming chief minister, he officially stated that doing labour is in the DNA of Biharis. Biharis are born to do labour work. Why did he say this? Because most of his rival KCR's officers had a Bihar background. So he was implying that Telangana is in a bad state because Biharis are running it. And to justify that, he added another statement saying it's in Biharis' DNA to do labour, and that's why KCR appointed them as bureaucrats,"" Kishor said.(You say Biharis are born to do labour work, and then come here and preach to us?)"" he told ANI in an interview.Recalling an unfulfilled promise from decades ago, Kishor also invoked former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s 1989 commitment to turn Bihar into a development hub.“Where did that money go? Congress remained in power afterwards, so tell us, what did you do for Bihar?” he asked.He further demanded that Rahul Gandhi issue an apology for what he called the “historic injustice” inflicted upon Biharis by the Congress.""If Congress apologised for the injustice done to Sikhs, then Rahul Gandhi should apologise to Biharis as well before campaigning in Bihar. If Biharis are only born for labour, then why are you coming here?

For the past 25-30 years, it's been a party that just carries Lalu ji's bag. If Rahul Gandhi truly has political strength, let him contest elections in Bihar on his own. Try demanding 40 per cent of the seats from Lalu ji and see what happens. In Bihar, Congress dances to Lalu ji's tune. Whatever he decides, that's what happens,"" he said.The Bihar assembly elections are expected to be held in October or November this year, though the Election Commission of India is yet to announce the official dates.The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), comprising the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Janata Dal (United), and Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), will look to retain power.On the other side, the Opposition’s INDIA bloc, consisting of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Congress, and the Left parties, aims to unseat CM Nitish Kumar.Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Party is positioning itself as a third alternative, aiming to disrupt the traditional bipolar contest in the state.In the current 243-member Bihar assembly, the NDA holds a majority with 131 seats -- BJP has 80 MLAs, JD(U) 45, HAM(S) 4, and support from two Independents. The INDIA bloc has a strength of 111, led by the RJD with 77 MLAs, Congress with 19, and the Left parties accounting for the rest.",Bihar braces for high-stakes assembly election later this year.

SC alarmed by Karnataka HC's retro use of 'grounds of arrest' order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-alarmed-by-karnataka-hcs-retro-use-of-grounds-of-arrest-order/articleshow/122100746.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday realised that its well-meaning rulings could cause huge complications in criminal law processes as it found that Karnataka high court had released a murder accused two years after his arrest as police had not informed him in writing the grounds of arrest as mandated by SC in Oct 2023.Appearing for Karnataka govt, senior advocate Sidharth Luthra told a bench led by Justice K V Viswanathan that SC rulings operate prospectively unless specifically directed for its retrospective application. He said the man was arrested on Feb 17, 2023, and was remanded to custody the same day in a murder case . The chargesheet has been filed and he is facing trial, Luthra said.However, nearly one-and-a-half years after SC in Pankaj Bansal case ruled on Oct 3, 2023 that investigating agencies must communicate in writing the grounds of arrest to the person being taken into custody, the murder accused moved Karnataka HC on March 22 this year questioning his arrest due to non-communication of the grounds of arrest in writing by relying on the SC ruling.Relying on subsequent rulings of SC reiterating the principle enunciated in Pankaj Bansal case, HC quashed his arrest but asked him to appear before the investigating officer, cooperate in the probe, not to threaten or tamper with witnesses, not to get involved in similar offences and not to leave the territory of the police station of Arsikere town without IO's permission.Justice Viswanathan said this could have a huge repercussion on thousands of arrests by police across states prior to pronouncement of the judgment in Pankaj Bansal case.""We are worried such a course of action, as adopted by Karnataka HC, will have a nation-wide implication and thousands of accused, arrested prior to Oct 3, 2023, may rush to courts seeking annulment of their arrests,"" he said.The bench noted that a similar question was pending judgment before a bench led by CJI B R Gavai, which had reserved verdict two months ago on April 22 on a petition filed by Mihir Rajesh Shah who had challenged his arrest alleging that the grounds of arrest were not communicated to him in writing by police.CJI Gavai and Justice A G Masih had raised two questions: Whether in every IPC case, it is mandatory to furnish grounds of arrest before or immediately after the arrest. And, whether the mandate could be optional in exceptional cases where it is impossible to provide grounds of arrest immediately on arrest.Referring to Mihir Shah's case, Justice Viswanathan said since the judgment could be expected after July 15 and could lay down guidelines regarding communication of grounds of arrest, it would be better to post the Karnataka case for hearing on July 18.Justice Viswanathan's apprehension was fully reflected in CJI Gavai's views, as before reserving verdict in Mihir Shah's case, he had observed, ""Imagine someone is shooting people in public. Should police take him into custody or wait to prepare grounds of arrest to be served on him prior to that? Our judgments (making it mandatory for police to furnish grounds of arrest in writing) have been grossly misused.""",Supreme court realised that its well-meaning rulings could cause huge complications in criminal law processes. Karnataka high court had released a murder accused two years after his arrest as police had not informed him in writing the grounds of arrest as mandated by sc in oct 2023.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122101056,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-50612,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
'BJP stooge': Mamata claims ECI covertly introducing NRC in Bengal; urges allies to 'build resistance',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-stooge-mamata-claims-eci-covertly-introducing-nrc-in-bengal-urges-allies-to-build-resistance/articleshow/122095852.cms,"West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee speaks to the media as she reviews the preparation on the eve of Rath Yatra at Digha Jagannath temple, in Purba Medinipur on Thursday. (ANI)

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday accused the Election Commission of India (ECI) of acting as a ""stooge of the BJP"" and making a “backdoor attempt to implement the NRC” under the guise of a special revision of electoral rolls.""This looks to be more dangerous than the NRC,"" she warned, calling on all opposition parties to resist what she described as a ""dangerous game"" threatening India’s democracy.Addressing a press conference from Digha in East Medinipur, where she’s overseeing preparations for Friday’s Rath Yatra, the TMC supremo said she had received two lengthy letters from the ECI containing new rules targeting voters born between July 1, 1987, and December 2, 2004.""I have received two letters from the ECI, each comprising 25-30 pages. I haven't been able to go through them in detail so far. But from what I have understood from a cursory glance, the Commission is now seeking a declaration form from voters born between July 1, 1987, and December 2, 2004, which is Annexure D in one of the letters, where they will have to submit birth certificates of both parents as proof of citizenship,"" she said, according to news agency PTI.""I don't understand the reason behind the ECI move or the rationale behind selecting these dates. This is nothing short of a scam. I seek clarification from the Commission on whether they are trying to implement the NRC through backdoors. In fact, this looks to be more dangerous than the NRC, which every political party in opposition must resist,"" Banerjee added.She futher claimed the BJP’s real target was Bengal, not Bihar, where assembly elections are due later this year.“Nothing will happen in Bihar because the BJP rules that state… They want to delete the names of valid young voters. Many parents will not be able to furnish their birth certificates,” she said, alleging that migrant workers, students, villagers, and uneducated voters were being selectively targeted.Banerjee also accused the ECI of bypassing political parties and serving the agenda of a “certain RSS pracharak” running the country -- an indirect reference to Union home minister Amit Shah.""How can the ECI do this unilaterally without consulting the recognised political parties at the central and state levels who play a key role in running the country's democratic structure? They are treating us like bonded labourers and doing this only to fulfil the wishes of a certain RSS pracharak who is now running the country for all practical purposes,"" she said.Citing an earlier ECI letter asking for details of TMC booth-level agents, she asked: ""Why should I reveal the names of my booth agents? So that the BJP can purchase them?""The West Bengal CM alleged that the BJP, with ECI’s support, was trying to enlist outsiders in Bengal's voter rolls while deleting genuine voters.“We ask the poll panel not to pressurise common people to accept their verdict. My humble request to the EC is that it should act impartially like it is expected to,” she said.Calling on opposition parties across India to take note, Banerjee said, “This ploy is now clear as daylight. We are the first to respond. But I urge the other opposition parties to take serious note of this and build resistance.”""Citizens should keep a keen eye on their status in electoral roles till the very end. Else they might find their names struck off and sent to detention camps. That's the intention of the BJP,"" she said, adding, ""our party will build up people's resistance against this and we will soon hit the streets.”","Mamata banerjee accuses election commission of india of acting as a ""stooge of the bjp"" west bengal chief minister says she has received two letters from the eci containing new rules targeting voters born between july 1, 1987, and december 2, 2004.

""I share good relations with the descendants of the Salar Jung family, so they gifted the land to me,"" he said.Police commissioner Pravin Pawar said Thursday that Jawed was summoned based on a complaint by a lawyer from Parbhani, flagging the ""hibanama"" (gift deed) in his name for what is regarded as ""prime land"" at Dawoodpura along Jalna Road in Sambhajinagar.""We will scan Jawed's income tax returns and details of any other source of income. He needs to explain why anyone from the Salar Jung family would make a gift deed in his name, giving away three acres in a prime location,"" inspector Sambhaji Pawar, part of the EOW team probing the land transfer, told TOI.Members of the Salar Jung family who signed the deed - Mir Mazhar Ali Khan and six of his relatives - are still to respond to EOW's notice to have their statements recorded, the officer said.Vilas, who represents Paithan constituency, protested against police allegedly dragging him and his father into the controversy over a land transfer deed in Jawed's name. ""EOW officials questioned me, too. Although Jawed is our driver, we don't have control over everything he does. In any case, hibanama is a legally valid process of gifting assets,"" he said.Several members of the Salar Jung family served as prime ministers to the erstwhile Nizams of Hyderabad.The gift deed executed by Mazhar Ali and six others states that they received their share of three out of 12 acres belonging to the clan at Bagsherganj in Dawoodpura after a prolonged litigation lasting till Jan 30, 2023. Police have found out that the gift deed in favour of Jawed was executed around the same time.Lawyer Mujahid Khan, whose complaint led EOW to initiate the probe, said his curiosity was piqued by the fact that Jawed wasn't even remotely related to the Salar Jung clan.""Why would the descendants of Salar Jung from Hyderabad give a gift deed to a person working as a driver in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, and that too after winning a legal battle for the same property. Also, a hibanama is legally valid only between blood relatives.
