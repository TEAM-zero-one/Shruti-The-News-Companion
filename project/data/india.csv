Though work on this Kashmir rail-link section was going on, it became extremely sluggish for around two years, Northern Railway officials recalled.The PILs challenged the ""alignment, faulty methodology and cost"" of the project, they said.It was only 2016 that the legal battle came to an end, with the Delhi HC in April accepting the railways' stand, and the Supreme Court, three months later, also disposing of cases. The rulings paved way for full-scale construction with work ""starting in full swing after July 2016"", as per an Northern Railway document.Officials, involved in court processes, recalled that with repeated filing of PILs impacting the work on the section, the Centre deployed the then additional solicitor general Maninder Singh in the HC to argue against the challenges, made tougher when a committee set up under E Sreedharan at the court's instance expressed reservations about the project's alignment proposed by the railway.""The project would have been completed early had there not been these court cases,"" a former Northern Railway official said.Officials said legal proceedings came to an end with the Railway Board submitting an affidavit on high court's directions.Disposing of the case, the HC said, ""The affidavit states that the Railway Board, after due consideration/ examination of the report of the Sreedharan committee, is fully satisfied with the safety, security and all other necessary/vital aspects of the existing alignment of the broad gauge railway line between Katra and Banihal as also regarding the bridge over the river Chenab and that the existing alignment as well as the bridge over the river Chenab are clear from the safety and security angles.

Government approves shifting of Gurgaon’s Kherki Daula toll plaza on Delhi-Jaipur NH to Pachgaon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-approves-shifting-of-gurgaons-kherki-daula-toll-plaza-on-delhi-jaipur-nh-to-pachgaon/articleshow/121702665.cms,"NEW DELHI: The government has approved shifting of Gurgaon’s Kherki Daula toll plaza on the Delhi-Jaipur National Highway (NH-48) to Pachgaon, a place beyond Manesar, paving the way for easy commute for lakhs of office goers.When the plaza is moved to Pachgaon, over 15 kilometres from Gurgaon, commuters travelling between Delhi and Manesar also won’t have to pay toll. Locals have been demanding its removal since 2014.TOI has learnt that Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari has approved the plan, and to ensure the new spot doesn’t see any congestion, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will go for Multi Lane Free Flow (MLFF) toll collection system. For the new facility, the Haryana government has provided nearly 28 acres of land to the highway authority, sources said.The process of shifting and starting the MMLF system to collect toll at Pachgaon may take around six months. “Pachgaon is the ideal location as it falls beyond Gurgaon and Manesar. Since there is an interchange of the Western Peripheral Expressway and the NH-48 at Pachgaon, the new toll collection point couldn’t have been beyond the intersection,” a source said.In the MMLF system, vehicles don’t need to stop as overhead cameras installed for each lane will read the vehicle registration number and automatically deduct the charge from the FASTag wallet linked to the vehicle.Sources said a decision has also been taken to have an integrated system to ensure that traffic coming from the Dwarka Expressway side and heading towards Jaipur don’t end up paying toll at this point once again as user fee. “This is very much possible. Once the annual toll pass for private vehicles is rolled out most of the issues will be resolved automatically,” said a source.The shifting of the toll plaza will end conflicts between operators and people from areas adjoining Kherki Daula, and fulfil the promise the Haryana and central governments have been making for the past seven to eight years.Locals have been demanding that the NHAI shift the toll plaza citing that the govt has recovered more than the investment made in constructing the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway by private players and the highway authority.In a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha in March, the road transport ministry said against Rs 2,489 crore incurred as cost for the NH-48’s Delhi-Gurgaon stretch, the toll collection has been around Rs 2,775 crore, around 11% more than the investment.After completion of this 27-km Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, commuters were paying user fees at Sirhaul (Delhi-Gurgaon border) and Kherki Daula toll plazas. Tolling was stopped at the Delhi-Gurgaon border in 2014, bringing relief to commuters travelling between Dhaula Kuan in Delhi and Kherki Daula. However, those going beyond this point paid toll for the entire stretch. At present, NHAI collects toll through its agency.Meanwhile, sources said the decision to shift the Kherki Daula toll plaza by the road transport ministry will create more pressure on the Delhi government and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) to do away with physical entry fee collection booths on the capital’s borders to prevent congestion. Traffic jams at these places defeat the purpose of huge investment in building highways and expressways for faster connectivity to Delhi.","The government has approved shifting of gurgaon’s kherki daula toll plaza on the delhi-jaipur national highway.

To be honest, mostly it has been quite open to criticism and constructive feedback. What happens though is that the BJP likes to create fissures. For example, in this entire dispute or debate over overseas delegation, there was no need for the BJP to promote a couple of names on its own and at the same time ask a party to recommend four names. Sanjay Jha

G-23: The rebels from within



Bihar's Pad Girl Talks About Marriage With Rahul Gandhi | Video From Bihar Goes Viral

Frankly, that was an attempt to muddy the waters within the Congress and just to complicate and play some kind of a political game to further widen rifts between certain leaders. Congress party needs to be smart here and needs to tell the people the country that the Congress has the talent and expertise in the people who can't just influence policies but the BJP needs them. And that tells you of why the Congress probably as good as a government in waiting. Sanjay Jha on all-party delegations

Tharoor vs Kharge: The battle of non-Gandhis



The Malabar tour



The off-script moments



Seeking clarity on his role:

I am 100% convinced that the Congress sees Shashi Tharoor as a strategic asset for the party. If the party were to have, for example, a shadow cabinet then Shashi Tharoor would definetely be the external affairs minister in it. I think it's just a question of the fact that Shashi is probably feeling that his talent and the value he brings to the table is not getting the respect and the recognition that it deserves. Sanjay Jha

Calling Congress 'family-run party':

Being in opposition, praising government:

The problem that happens in all political parties, the Congress is not an exception, is that the party takes a certain posture or a position over a certain issue and mostly everybody is expected to fall in line. And in this case, they had probably felt that Shashi had transgressed the party line. Having said that, I do believe that Shashi is an extraoridnary personality and he deserves to be accomodated within the Congress thinking despite the fact that occassionally, he might have a different viewpoint. Sanjay Jha

I don't think Shashi Tharoor is going to leave the Congress. He is definitely not going to ever join the BJP if you read his writings, if you hear his speeches in Parliament and outside. He has been one of the most vocal critiques of Mr Modi's government. So, I don't see him going there at all because that will completely negate his entire work done over his whole lifetime. And you wouldn't do that for some kind of a small or petty political point to prove. I think it's important for Congress and Shashi Tharoor to have a conversation together and put this acrimony and bitterness behind as soon as possible. Sanjay Jha

In the Congress party ’s grand old history, few members have both dazzled and defied the high command quite like Shashi Tharoor . Clearly not a quockerwodger, Tharoor has often seemed like a square peg in the round hole of Congress' hierarchy — respected, admired, but never quite aligned.These days, when the man speaks, Congress gets nervous, BJP listens, and Oxford updates its dictionary. From internal rebellions to off-script admiration for rivals, Tharoor’s political journey within the party has been as unpredictable as his vocabulary.However, this is not the first time that Tharoor is giving a hard time to Congress. The two have had a bumpy ride, especially after the party lost 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Speaking to TOI, former Congress spokesperson and author Sanjay Jha, said ""Congress needs to encourage a more freewheeling, inner party democracy.""Tharoor was part group of 23 senior Congress leaders who wrote to the higher command in 2020 demanding internal reforms and a long-term stable leadership only to be dismissed by Gandhi loyalists.The Congress Working Committee (CWC) had unanimously rebuked the dissenters behind the letter and instead urged Rahul Gandhi to take over as party president.Dismissing the G-23's demand for strong and permanent leadership, the CWC had asserted that it was Sonia and Rahul Gandhi who had consistently challenged the BJP government’s actions.The move was widely seen as a mutiny against the Gandhi family’s grip on the party. While the Congress dismissed the concerns as ""constructive feedback,"" the message was loud and clear: Tharoor wasn’t afraid to ruffle feathers.In 2022, Tharoor took the rebellion a step further — by contesting the Congress presidential election. It was the party's first non-Gandhi face-off in 24 years, and the symbolism was rich. Facing off against Mallikarjun Kharge , the Gandhi-endorsed candidate, Tharoor spoke of the need for internal democracy, a level playing field, and meaningful change.Instead, what he got was a polite pat on the back and a resounding loss. He later noted the contest lacked a fair footing, subtly pointing to Kharge's proximity to the Gandhis as the real deciding factor. If there was ever a politically correct way to shout “rigged,” Tharoor found it.Not long after, Tharoor embarked on his own political safari across Kerala's Malabar region, drawing ire from the state Congress leadership. Party leaders accused him of running a ""parallel campaign,"" with opposition leader VD Satheesan bluntly saying that the Congress ""won’t tolerate such activities.""The trip seemed less like a listening tour and more like a soft launch of “Brand Tharoor” — suave, solo, and slightly rebellious.Tharoor has, at several times, questioned his role in the party- a subtle way of asking 'What exactly am I doing here?' Earlier this year, the rumours of rift got fuel after he publicly criticised leadership vacuum in Kerala Congress and met Rahul Gandhi to seek clarity over his own role within the party.Responding to whether Congress sees Tharoor as an asset or a liability at this point, Jha said with absolute certainty that the party sees Thiruvananthapuram MP as a ""strategic asset"". ""If the party were to have, for example, a shadow cabinet, then Shashi Tharoor would be the external affairs minister,"" he said.However, he added that ""Shashi is probably feeling that his talent and the value he brings to the table is not getting the respect and the recognition that it deserves"".When asked if Tharoor-Congress rift would alienate the grand old party from urban, liberal voters, Jha dismissed this saying that ""urban voter or the liberal voter, as we call it, goes much beyond one individual"". He, however, noted Tharoor's ""huge impact, especially on the English-speaking more corporate and younger demography of India"". Bharatiya Janata Party has often used the dynasty-driven feature of Congress to attack the party. Making to the good books of the saffron party, the writer of 'Why I am a Hindu' had not-so-subtly commented on this.When he was asked who would be the PM if party won the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, he had said, ""My guess is from the Congress party either Mr Kharge who will then be the first Dalit Prime Minister of India or Rahul Gandhi since in many ways it is a 'family-run' party.""Tharoor sparked controversy after he praised the ruling government's policies- both at Centre and state of Kerala.His repeated praise for the Modi-government's polices on Covid vaccine, Russia-Ukraine and now, Operation Sindoor , made the Congress distance itself from his views. He even went against the party's narrative to defend Modi-government over Donald Trump claiming credit for India-Pakistan truce.His recent support for the Centre, especially Operation Sindoor, earned him the title of ""super spokesperson of the BJP"". He has, however, made it clear that he was only speaking in national interest, given that the BJP chose him to lead delegation to US to present India's side on Operation Sindoor.While the rumours on the road keep bringing Tharoor and BJP closer, Jha completely rejected this calling him one of the most ""vocal critics"" of the Modi government.""He is definitely not going to ever join the BJP,"" he said, adding that doing so would ""completely negate his entire work done over his lifetime. ""If you read his writings, his speeches outside the Parliamnet, he is one of the most vocal critics of Mr Modi's government,"" he said.Now, the question is: will he walk away, or continue needling the Congress from within? Well, Jha suggests a conversation between the two.One thing is limpid— Tharoor is a rebel who arrives armed with both a dictionary and a dagger. But this time, it’s not his florid prose, but his plainspoken candour that seems to have unsettled the party's upper echelons.","Congress needs to encourage a more freewheeling inner party democracy, says sanjay jha. The congress sees shashi tharoor as a strategic asset for the party, he says. Jha doesn't think shashi will ever join the bjp. Tharoor was part group of 23 senior congress leaders who wrote to the higher command in 2020 demanding internal reforms and a long-term stable leadership.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121690759,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1052667,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Mirwaiz and Hurriyat Conference chairman Umar Farooq’s family has traditionally led prayers at the mosque for generations.“It is deeply regrettable that once again, people were not allowed to offer Eid prayers at the historic Jamia Masjid,” Omar said. He expressed helplessness, saying law and order in J&K Union territory fell under the purview of lieutenant governor (LG) Manoj Sinha’s administration. “I have no idea on what grounds such decisions are made,” the CM said.Omar urged the authorities to trust J&K’s residents, saying “these are the same people who, after the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, came forward and unequivocally condemned it”. The CM called on “the govt” to reconsider such actions in the future, alluding probably to the administration of the Centre-appointed LG.Mirwaiz Umar Farooq decried the mosque closure.“Yet again, Kashmir wakes up to the sad reality: no Eid prayers at Eidgah, and Jama Masjid locked down for 7th straight year. I, too, have been detained at my home. In a Muslim-majority region, Muslims are deprived of their fundamental right to pray even on their most important religious occasion celebrated across the world! What a shame on those who rule over us, and on those elected by the people who choose to remain silent as our rights are trampled over, again and again,” the Mirwaiz posted on X.J&K police and home department had not issued any statement on locking of the mosque and Mirwaiz’s detention.PDP president and former CM Mehbooba Mufti joined the condemnation, accusing the Omar-led govt of being “mere spectators”. “J&K is the only Muslim-majority region in the country, and yet it is here that a major mosque is shut down on Eid, denying people their right to offer prayers. If govt claims everything is normal in J&K, why is the Mirwaiz not allowed to offer prayers,” Mehbooba said.Asked about the restrictions, BJP functionary and J&K Waqf Board chairperson Darkshan Andrabi declined comment. “Jamia Masjid doesn’t come under Waqf Board,” she said.","Mirwaiz umar farooq placed under house arrest saturday on eid-ul-adha.

NEW DELHI: Haragobindo Das and his son Chandan Das were dragged out of their home and brutally killed with an axe in front of their family members during the communal violence that erupted in Murshidabad in April, police said in a chargesheet filed in the case.The police on Friday submitted a 900-page chargesheet before the Jangipur court, naming 13 accused in connection with the killings and the broader violence that rocked the district.According to the chargesheet, the victims, residents of Betbona village in Zafarabad, were among three people killed during the unrest, which broke out amid protests over the Waqf (Amendment) Act in the Muslim-majority district.The 13 accused have been charged under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, including murder committed by a group, rioting, house-trespass, and house-breaking. Provisions of the Arms Act have also been invoked, a senior officer confirmed.Read: Rahul Gandhi hits back at EC: Congress MP demands voter rolls, CCTV footage; rebuts 'evasive' reply to 'match fixing' claim The chargesheet outlines in detail how the accused forcefully entered the Das family's home, attacked the father-son duo in full view of other family members, and later fled the scene. It also documents the police's efforts to track down and arrest the suspects, some of whom went into hiding immediately after the crime.The violence, which engulfed parts of Murshidabad from April 8 to 12, led to large-scale arson and destruction of property.The situation grew so volatile that the Calcutta High Court had to intervene, ordering the deployment of Central Armed Police Forces to restore order.Police have since registered over 60 FIRs across the district and arrested more than 300 individuals in connection with the riots.The trial in the Das murder case is expected to begin soon, officials said, as the court begins examining the voluminous evidence submitted by officials.","Haragobindo das and his son chandan das were dragged out of their home and brutally killed with an axe in front of their family members.

Argument turns fatal

Planned murder, say police

NEW DELHI: In a gruesome act, a 26-year-old man allegedly beheaded his wife on the outskirts of Bengaluru over suspicions of infidelity and rode to the police station with her severed head to surrender, police said on Saturday.The incident occurred late Friday night in Heelalige village near Chandapura in Anekal taluk. The accused, identified as Shankar, was arrested soon after he confessed to killing his wife, 25-year-old Manasa, at the police station.According to police, the couple had been married for over five years and shared a four-year-old daughter. Both were employed with private firms; Shankar worked in Koramangala and Manasa in Bommasandra.Police said Shankar suspected his wife of having an extramarital affair, which had been the cause of frequent disputes between them. Following a recent argument, Manasa had moved in with her mother. She returned on Friday evening, reportedly in an attempt to reconcile for the sake of their daughter.""Around 8 pm, the couple got into another heated argument. Manasa denied having any affair. During the confrontation, in a fit of rage, Shankar took a sickle and beheaded her,"" a senior police officer said.After the gruesome act, Shankar left the body inside the house and carried her head on his scooter to the nearest police station, where he confessed to the crime.Preliminary investigation suggests the murder was premeditated.

The order, issued late on 7 June by Commissioner-cum-Secretary (Home) N Ashok Kumar, affects Imphal West, Imphal East, Thoubal, Kakching and Bishnupur districts.The official directive stated, “In view of the prevailing law and order situation in the State of Manipur especially in Imphal West, Imphal East, Thoubal, Kakching & Bishnupur districts… there is apprehension that some anti-social elements might use social media extensively for transmission of images, hate speech and hate video messages inciting the passions of the public which might have serious repercussions for the law and order situation. ”The government cited an “imminent danger of loss of life and/or damage to public/private property” and the risk of “wide spread disturbances to public tranquillity and communal harmony” due to the circulation of false rumours and inflammatory material on platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and X (formerly Twitter). The suspension, according to the order, covers internet and mobile data services, including VSAT and VPN, and took effect from 11:45 pm on 7 June.“The order is being passed ex-parte in view of the emergent situation,” it noted.The action followed protests on Saturday night in Imphal East and Imphal West, where demonstrators took to the streets after the arrest of a leader of the Meitei outfit Arambai Tenggol. Protesters reportedly blocked roads with burning tyres and furniture in areas like Kwakeithel and Uripok, demanding the leader’s release. In a video widely circulated online, BJP MP Leishemba Sanajaoba appeared to confront security personnel, urging them to arrest him alongside another MLA if such arrests continued.The unrest coincided with an intensified security crackdown.

Due to continuous increase in Minimum Support Price (MSP), the country's food producers are not only receiving fair prices for their crops but are also experiencing a rise in their income,"" Modi posted on X, reflecting on the last 11 years.The PM highlighted that govt has paid close attention to key aspects such as soil health and irrigation, which have been greatly beneficial, and urged people to read the thread, posted by the citizen engagement platform of the govt on empowering farmers and uplifting the country's farmers.The platform also shared basic details of almost all the initiatives taken by the Modi govt in the last 11 years for farmers and the farm sector. It noted that the crop insurance scheme helped insure over 23 crore farmers and disbursed claims of Rs 1.75 lakh crore, securing incomes and reducing risk.
