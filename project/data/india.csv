What happens to Zeenat will decide the fate of 15 tigers in India

Corridor Trails

Early Hiccups

The Road Ahead

Dec 8, 2024 | For Zeenat, it may have been the call of the wild, some primal instinct that urged her to move. The three-year-old tigress was supposed to stay within the confines of Odisha’s Similipal Tiger Reserve, where she had been translocated from Maharashtra’s Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve. But Zeenat knows no manmade borders. She gave in to the wild wanderlust and sets out from the reserve, traversing Odisha, Jharkhand and Bengal, travelling more than 300km and setting off a flurry of activity among forest officials. She is finally captured at a village in Bengal’s Bankura on Dec 29.Jan 12, 2025 | A male tiger in its prime enters Bengal from Purulia, gets clicked in a camera trap, giving the district its first ever recorded evidence of a tiger. As the big cat keeps wandering between Bengal and Jharkhand, the tiger cell at National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) confirms that it was first photographed in a trap camera in Chhattisgarh’s Balrampur forest division in March 2024, then in Jharkhand’s Palamau Tiger Reserve in May-June and later in Bengal’s Purulia and Jhargram in Jan 2025.India’s animal translocation efforts have come under serious scrutiny. The ambitious cheetah project in MP’s Kuno National Park has already courted controversy, having recorded numerous deaths since the first cheetah was released there from Africa in 2022. Even intra-country efforts are not going as planned, as evidenced from Zeenat’s travels. Another tigress — Yamuna — procured from Tadoba is also not settling down in Similipal, even as Bengal grapples with a tiger for the second time in three weeks. This has raised serious doubts on the practice of ‘forced’ redistribution of big cats from tiger-rich states to depleted habitats.India has seen a significant ‘unplanned’ movement of big cats in recent weeks, of them either straying into human settlements, or moving out of designated zones, reminding wildlife authorities of challenges in tiger conservation efforts. Recently, a tiger dispersed from Sariska Tiger Reserve and strayed into human habitation in Rajasthan’s Alwar, until it had to be darted and brought back to its habitat.Managing translocated animals and ensuring survival of their cubs in the wild is a bit tricky, given the risks involved, says Subharanjan Sen , MP’s chief wildlife warden. “In Kuno, we initially brought eight cheetahs. Later on, 12 were released in phases. The cheetah was extinct in India, and we brought the cubs from Namibia. I will not call the project a failure, but eight adult cheetahs have died. The population is now 24. Out of 17 cubs, 12 have survived.”Even though this is a reminder of the complex dynamics of forced redistribution, National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) is pushing forward with its ambitious tiger recovery programme. A new proposal aims to relocate 15 tigers from MP to three states: Odisha, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.Past experiences raise concerns about the success of such programmes, though NTCA member secretary Gobind Sagar Bhardwaj says comprehensive management efforts would be taken before executing relocation of tigers in Similipal, especially after a poaching of a melanistic tiger.Experts are wary, as state govts, in their eagerness to showcase conservation success, often overlook critical scientific protocol. “Translocation has become more about political image-building than scientific wildlife management,” says wildlife conservationist Biswajit Mohanty.Experts say the recent movement of wandering tigers, particularly in east-central India (covering Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha and Bengal), points to the importance of preserving and maintaining ‘wildlife corridors’ — designated areas that connects wildlife populations that have been separated by human activity.These corridors, many feel, would do naturally what forced translocations are failing to achieve: long-term survival of wildlife, guard against localised extinctions and ensure exchange of gene flow, which helps in population diversity. In other words, let Mother Nature have her say.“If movement corridors are restored, in the long run, they will naturally ensure tiger dispersal from one landscape to another,” says scientist and conservationist Y V Jhala , who recently retired as dean of Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and was in charge of the initiative to reintroduce the cheetah in India. “This, coupled with good management practices and protection measures in tiger landscapes, will lead to less dependency on relocation projects such as those for tigers.”But chances of restoring the corridors are very little, given there’s so much fragmentation, says K Ramesh, a senior scientist and professor with WII. “Many corridors have gone beyond restoration because of agriculture and developmental activity,” he adds.There is, however, still some evidence that some wildlife trails still exist. In March 2023, a dispersing tiger was caught in a camera trap in Odisha’s Bonai division. NTCA tiger cell sources said this big cat was clicked in a trap camera in MP’s Sanjay National Park when it was a cub. It was also later clicked in Jharkhand’s Palamau Tiger Reserve. But unlike the ‘Purulia tiger’, which headed east from Palamau to enter Bengal, this tiger headed southwards to reach Odisha, pointing towards a still-functional corridor on the landscape.Between 2010 and 2022, the tiger population in India has grown from 1,700+ to 3,600+, presenting a new challenge, despite this success: long-distance migration of big cats, particularly males, from reserves with surplus populations.MP and Maharashtra, two of the best performing states in terms of tiger conservation, frequently witness migrations eastwards towards the forests of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Telangana and Bengal.But here, most areas neither have enough prey nor female tigers, two things that dispersing male tigers look for.“At Palamau, we have been regularly getting pictures of tigers since 2022, but all are males,” says Kumar Ashuthosh , who recently retired as field director, Palamau Tiger Reserve. “It is the dearth of female tigers, perhaps, that is not allowing more males to settle there. Some of them often vanish after wandering into the reserve. There were plans to write to NTCA to get two females under a relocation programme, on the lines of Similipal.”But such translocation projects, too, present certain challenges.Rajasthan’s Sariska and MP’s Panna were the first two parks to show the way in terms of tiger relocation in India. But a similar move — the first such inter-state project in India — failed, when two big cats from MP’s Bandhavgarh and Kanha couldn’t make Odisha’s Satkosia their home. While the male tiger fell prey to poachers, the female (Sundari) had to be sent back to Kanha and then to a zoo after being tagged ‘man-eater’.On the Panna model, a senior MP forester said that by 2009, Panna National Park became the second tiger reserve in India after Sariska to lose all its tigers. But Panna has successfully reintroduced tigers into the park’s natural habitats, resulting in close to 80 tigers, including cubs, thriving within its more than 500sq km boundaries.Despite starting early, Sariska, where the current tiger population is about 30, lags behind.“Issues like village relocation and poaching threat continue to prevail,” a source says.Taking lessons from Satkosia, authorities in north Bengal’s Buxa Tiger Reserve, where a similar plan is afoot, are treading cautiously. If all goes well, tigers may be brought either from Kaziranga or Orang, both in Assam, to Buxa, where camera traps had captured a tiger in Dec 2021 after four decades — again underscoring the importance of corridors between forests of Bhutan, Assam and N Bengal. Plans are on to shift two villages from the core area.In Palamu, NTCA had sent a proposal for tiger relocation to the back burner because of two villages with over 200 families inside the core area. According to RameshF, the Palamau habitat is still good and that tigers will make a comeback once the prey numbers rebound.The success of tiger relocation plan depends on how much connected the forest department is with local communities, where newly dispersed tigers will invariably disperse, Sen says. “Satkosia did not have enough prey and a new tiger was introduced, leading to Sundari’s dispersal soon after release,” he explains.Another thing to bear in mind is the peculiar challenges posed by new habitats. Though Similipal’s landscape is considered to be closely similar to central India’s in terms of flora and fauna, its high terrain and rocky hills are unique, absent in most tiger habitats in Maharashtra and MP. In Zeenat’s case, the Odisha forest department has it on record that the tigress got frightened by herds of elephants, which made it disperse too far.Bhanumitra Acharya, a former honorary wildlife warden, says translocation efforts are jeopardised by hasty decisions, often for the sake of “image-building of the receiving state.”With Zeenat’s fate now locked in a soft enclosure, it is not going to be easy for authorities to take a call on its re-release into the wild. Anup Nayak, former member secretary, NTCA, feels flawed selection of tigers for translocation — especially its age — is also crucial. “Tigers that are either too young or too old often struggle to adapt to new environments. Also, tigers that have grown up in areas with human presence pose risks in their new habitats,” he says.Tigers are also exploratory creatures, and it’s natural for them to look for their own solitary space once shifted to a new habitat,” says Joydip Kundu, a conservation campaigner and founder of SHER (Society for Heritage & Ecological Researches). “Tigers always start exploring new landscapes, and this can land them in different sanctuaries at times. But it is their right to get corridors to move and forests rich with enough prey.”","Zeenat, a three-year-old tigress, was supposed to stay within the confines of odisha’s similipal tiger reserve. But zeenat gave in to the wild wanderlust and sets out from the reserve, traversing odisha, jharkhand and bengal. She is finally captured at a village in bengal's bankura on dec 29.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118516798,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1539665,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Some very basic coal mining terms start with the word ‘man’. Manway, man-riding, mantrip… But managers (all of them men) of the 11 Incline mine of Singareni Collieries Ltd, one of the oldest coal mining PSUs in the country, feel it is about time ‘man’ is replaced with ‘person’. That’s because Singareni Collieries has become the first PSU in the country to allow women into underground mines. It has decided to dedicate one mine each — underground and opencast — to women.The central govt changed the law, allowing women in underground mines, in 2019, 82 years after the British govt first banned their entry. The 1937 ban sought to protect women from what was seen as an inhuman and oppressive working environment, not suited for women. The ban was lifted in 1943 but was back again in 1946.TOI visited Telangana’s Ramagundam coal mine areas in Peddapalli district recently where the 11 Incline mine is also located. There are 23 women miners there. They don’t exude toughness. It’s hard to picture them inside a mine. But the moment they start putting on their gear to travel almost 2 km underground — heavy-duty boots, sturdy helmets, workman’s overalls and headlights — you realise they are pros. Unlike the all-male TOI team, which struggled with the gear.The atmosphere in a coal mine, especially for someone not used to those narrow confines, can be stifling. There is obviously no natural light, the space is narrow and everything you say echoes. A man-riding train takes you down.But the women seem at home in this dark universe. They fit into it as if it was their natural domain.Among the women is Neredukomma Hiranmayee . If the central govt decided to amend the Coal Mining Act and allow women into underground coal mines it was largely because of this unrelenting lady who decided to challenge the laws of the land.“Seven women students, including me, were about to graduate from a mining college not far from here when we saw an ad by Singareni looking for engineers, but it said only men could apply,” Hiranmayee says. “This was very disheartening. We decided to go to Delhi and talk to the central govt about allowing us to do the work we were trained for. Allowing women to study mining and then not letting them work in mines — we were not ready to accept that.”The top of her forehead is dotted with vermillion, the marker of a traditional, married woman.Hiranmayee led the group of seven students who went to Delhi in 2017, and after much struggle managed to meet the then Union labour minister Santosh Gangwar . The Mines Act, 1952 was then amended to allow women in mines with some conditions. Women were to work in underground mines only between 7 am and 6 pm. They needed to give a written consent. And they had to work in groups, always.“The decision to go to Delhi was a tough one,” Hiranmayee adds. “Our college management was a little upset with us because they felt we were going against the govt and refused to help us, but we were adamant and that helped. In fact, it was strange that each time we visited mines as students for internships, those working there always encouraged us.In this group of 23, some come from families that have spent a couple of generations in coal mines and some have no family connections.Both the paternal and maternal grandfathers of Swathi Penugonada were Singareni employees. Swathi’s mother insisted that at least one of her two daughters got a Singareni job.But because women were not allowed in coal mines until 2019, she had joined an aerospace company as a quality control engineer. But the moment the mines opened up to women, she applied and got in. “I have worked very hard to be here and I feel proud that I am living my mother’s dream,” she says.Swathi adds that there was a lot of pressure from her extended family to get married, but because her mother stood by her, she was able to push back and become a miner.Allam Navyashree is a 2019 mining engineering graduate. “I got a job with a private firm first, working in underground mines as a section supervisor.” She says at the time there were no women in supervisory positions in underground mines. “I was one of the first. I had to listen to many comments from men openly saying that women are not fit for underground coal mines. But despite all the challenges I cleared my training period and exams. I even ended up supervising the men who said I was not fit for the job.”A mother of two kids, Chunchu Sandhya Rani, got into the mining en gineer job after her marriage. “When I got married in my final year of the mining engineering course from Jawaharlal Nehru Technical University (JNTU), Manthani, I thought my working life was over. But my husband, in-laws and my father encouraged me to apply for the job at Singareni mines. Now, my parents look after my two kids when I come to the mines,” Sandhya says.For Neeli Jyothsna, a diploma holder in ITI electric and now a trainee, her goal was only to land a govt job as none of her family was a govt employee. Her father, a private teacher, tried for a govt job but failed. Now, she has fulfilled her father’s dream.Thorrikonda Srivarsha continued the family tradition of landing jobs at Singareni. Both her grandfathers — her mother’s father and father’s father — were Sinagareni workers. Her mother wants the legacy to continue.Chilka Srinivas, deputy general manager and project officer at 11 Incline, says Singareni Collieries has been at the forefront in giving “equality below ground”. As of now, 16 types of designations and jobs have been identified for women, both in underground and opencast mines.Singareni Collieries’ Ramagundam Area-1 general manager Lalit Kumar D says women employees and workers now work at a depth of about 450 metres from the surface, travelling along three man-riding systems, for a distance of 4.5 km one way, which includes mechanised transport and man-ridings. “Mining is all about 3 Ds — dark, dirty and dangerous. But women work on a par with men,” Kumar adds.The GM says Singareni Collieries is providing equal opportunities for women and ensuring their safety. There’s a separate transport facility for women, first-aid rooms with female nurses, washrooms and creche. And everyone’s being trained on gender sensitivity.","Women were banned from underground mines, till seven women students petitioned the central govt to lift it.

who powered it

■ What inspired you to study the soft porn boom of ’90s and 2000s Kerala?

■ What led to its swift rise and fall?

■ Shakeela became synonymous with the industry. How did it impact her life?

■ How much control did starlets working on these projects have?

■ Were women able to watch these films?

■ These films portrayed unexplored forms of desire such as female orgasms and masturbation. Was it deliberate?

While doing my MPhil, I was trying to understand how young boys or teens get to know about sex education. After much coaxing, they said they learnt about sexuality and intimacy (what a condom was, for instance) through soft porn films. That made me think about the genre, but there wasn’t much scholarship about it then. Everyone told me these movies were made in Kodambakkam, Chennai. So, I went there, to the streets everyone told me existed, but no one was there. That’s when I learnt about Kodambakkam’s fictitious, pseudonym-driven production culture that capitalised on the reserve pool of mainstream cinema. They were tapping into people waiting for a break that never came. I started spending time at film labs and, after five months of waiting, I was finally introduced to someone who worked in soft porn.Soft porn became a parallel industry in the 1990s and early 2000s primarily owing to the financial crisis mainstream cinema faced. Many films made by prominent directors, featuring A-list actors, failed miserably at the box office. Exhibitors and distributors were trying to figure out what would work, and the quickly produced, low-budget formula of soft porn made it viable. However, oversaturation led to its decline — films with similar storylines, the same cast and crew with maybe 10 or 15 women who acted in all these films. Shakeela, for instance, began to charge per day rather than per film at one point. She got Rs 1.5 lakh a day, but what she didn’t know was that one day’s footage was being used for multiple films.Soft porn did become equivalent to Shakeela, but its fallout was that she never got to play a real character in Malayalam cinema . She tried directing a film, but everyone wanted to see her as the actress. Interestingly, for someone seen as the fantasy of heterosexual men, Shakeela was closely associated with the trans community and its causes. Now that she is gearing up for politics, I’m curious to know how she navigates the expectation of respectability.They didn’t have much control over what ended up at the editing table. They shared quasi-family relationships with directors and technicians, so it wasn’t direct exploitation. Some told me it was a way to get a foothold in the mainstream industry and make connections with directors. But once you’re a part of soft porn, your chances in the mainstream went down.Most cinema halls I went to in Kerala weren’t willing to have women in the audience, unless they were sex workers. But I spoke with many women who watched these films on cable television late at night. The female lead appeals to people because she’s sexually autonomous and doesn’t care about middle-class morality. Funnily, the men who acted in soft porn were more embarrassed to speak with me as their work was seen as demasculinising. The strong female lead was the fulcrum of the narrative. She needs to have sex, and sometimes there are references to it not being fulfilling. The men take that personally, feeling like they were just an extra in a Shakeela film, rather than an actor.Female sexual pleasure is a big no-no in mainstream filmic depiction. Women as agents of pleasure was something impossible to imagine in dominant media. When I asked directors why they wanted to show female pleasure, they said they wanted to change the dynamics, where instead of a hero dictating things, it’s a woman. The female lead then stands in for the man and is allowed those desires.",Darshana sreedhar mini studies kerala’s once-bustling adult film industry.

NEW DELHI/AMRITSAR: A batch of 12 illegal Indian immigrants deported from the US to Panama arrived Sunday in Delhi via Istanbul on a Turkish Airlines flight, making them the first group to be sent back without restraints since three American military aircraft brought 332 deportees to Amritsar within a fortnight this month.The 12 deportees are said to be among 50 undocumented Indian nationals who reportedly arrived in Panama recently. Panama has been assisting the US in its deportation efforts.According to local media reports, the UN-affiliated International Organisation for Migration helped purchase plane tickets for people of various nationalities whose citizenship was confirmed, 17 of them Indians. More deportees from the group are expected next week once MEA verifies their nationality.Deportation from Panama is being carried out under the Regional Assisted Voluntary Return Programme , an IOM protection and support response to facilitate the dignified, safe, regular and orderly return, as well as voluntary and based on an informed decision, of migrants to their countries of origin.Four men from Punjab in the latest batch took a connecting IndiGo flight from Delhi to Amritsar.Airport authorities in the city were informed in advance about the arrival of Patiala resident Jatinder Singh, Maninder Dutt of Jalandhar, and Jugraj Singh and Harpreet Singh from Gurdaspur, but it wasn't immediately clear whether they came unescorted all the way from Panama.Official sources said after the mandatory debriefing that Jatinder, 34, paid a travel agent from Patiala Rs 52 lakh to help him enter the US through a route criss-crossing Guyana, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico.Maninder, 21, put his faith and Rs 42 lakh in the hands of a Delhi-based illegal immigration agent, who then sent him on a perilous journey through Spain, Salvador, Guatemala, and Mexico. Jugraj and Harpreet, both 30, paid Rs 38 lakh each to an agent from Batala and reached the US via Nicaragua.Punjab NRI minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal said the state govt had registered cases against 15 travel agents based on complaints from natives of the state who were deported from the US this month. Of these, three agents have been arrested, while police have been raiding offices and homes in search of the absconding 12.Sources said the deportees who arrived on Sunday told authorities they intended to file cases against the travel agents who duped them only if there was a chance of getting their money back.The first US military flight that arrived on Feb 5 brought 104 deportees, with both men and women handcuffed and their feet shackled. The second flight, carrying 119 deportees, arrived on Feb 15. The third flight, with 112 deportees, landed on Feb 16, this time with only the men in shackles.",Four men from punjab in the latest batch took a connecting indigo flight from delhi to amritsar.

Will focus on making Delhi a 'viksit rajdhani': Sachdeva

NEW DELHI: CM Rekha Gupta said Sunday the previous AAP dispensation left the state coffers ""empty"", but assured that the BJP govt was ""committed"" to rolling out the Rs 2,500-per month honorarium scheme for eligible women.Addressing a joint press meet with Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva after a legislative party huddle, Gupta said several rounds of meetings had been held with govt officials on the issue in the past four days since she took over.""The condition the previous govt left for us... when we sit with officers to review the financial status... the entire govt exchequer is found empty,"" Gupta said, while replying to a question on preparations to implement the women's aid scheme. ""But giving the money to women is a routine work we have to do. We will surely implement the scheme with detailed planning. It's our commitment. We will do it 1,000%,"" the CM said.According to an estimate, after excluding taxpayers, govt servants and beneficiaries of other state welfare schemes, around 38 lakh women above 18 will be eligible for assistance under this scheme. The govt may need over Rs 11,000 crore annually for this.Giving a monthly honorarium of Rs 2,500 per month to women in Delhi under the ' Mahila Samriddhi Yojana ' was one of the prominent electoral promises made by BJP in the run-up to the assembly polls.The Delhi CM said the first day of the Delhi assembly session on Monday will see the election of Speaker and Deputy Speaker followed by the newly-elected legislators taking oath. She added that the three-day assembly session will focus on discussions about development projects. ""The most important aspect of the session, as we committed, will be the laying of the pending CAG reports in the house and the previous govt must now answer the people of Delhi for the misuse of their hard-earned money,"" Gupta said, adding that all commitments made by BJP will be fulfilled.On former CM Atishi's statement that her govt followed the procedure and forwarded the CAG reports to the lieutenant governor for approval before tabling them in the house, Sachdeva said the AAP dispensation was in a habit of ""peddling lies."" ""They should be ready to reply (on CAG reports),"" he added. The assembly session is starting Monday and will continue till Thursday.Sachdeva also said that the BJP govt in the next five years will focus on making Delhi a ""viksit rajdhani"" (developed capital). ""All MLAs discussed in the meeting on how to take forward the developmental works in their respective constituencies. Our govt will complete all the projects and fulfil the expectations of the people. AAP's attempts to defame the BJP by spreading lies will be countered by the work of our legislators,"" the Delhi BJP president said.","Delhi cm rekha gupta says previous aap dispensation left the state coffers ""empty"" she assured that the bjp govt was ""committed"" to rolling out the rs 2,500-per month honorarium scheme for eligible women.

NEW DELHI: Vasundhara Oswal , daughter of Indian-origin billionaire Pankaj Oswal , has broken her silence on her three-week nightmare behind bars in Uganda. Falsely accused of kidnapping and murdering her father’s former employee, she endured prison conditions that she calls a “gross violation of human rights.”The 26-year-old was arrested on October 1, 2024, over the alleged abduction of Mukesh Menaria , a former employee of Pankaj Oswal.However, the case crumbled when Menaria was found alive in Tanzania just days later.Despite this, Vasundhara remained imprisoned for weeks. Speaking to PTI on Friday, she recalled the horrors she faced, ""I was detained for five days, then thrown in prison for two weeks. I wasn’t allowed to shower, and they denied me food and water. My parents had to bribe police officers just to get me basic necessities.”At one point, she was reportedly denied access to a washroom as punishment.According to Vasundhara, Ugandan police raided her premises without a warrant and took her away under false pretenses. ""When I asked them to present a search warrant, they said, ‘We are in Uganda, we can do anything. You’re not in Europe anymore,’” she alleged.She claimed a male officer physically forced her into a police van when she refused to comply immediately.Forced to give a statement without a criminal lawyer, Vasundhara said she was made to pay $30,000 and surrender her passport for a police bond—yet she was still thrown back in her cell. Even after obtaining an unconditional release order from the courts, she was illegally detained for another 72 hours.Shockingly, instead of dismissing the case after Menaria was found alive on October 10, authorities kept her in prison and even escalated her charges from kidnapping to attempted murder.Initially housed in a facility for petty criminals, Vasundhara was later moved to a prison for convicted murderers and human traffickers. She spent two weeks in Nakasongola prison , fearing for her life.After weeks of legal battles, she secured bail on October 21, but her ordeal was far from over. Her passport was only returned on December 10, and the case was not dismissed until December 19.Vasundhara alleges that corrupt officials kept the charges alive even after Menaria was found, reducing them later to a misdemeanor confinement charge—all in an attempt to extort more money.""This was done to keep something over our heads and squeeze more money from my family,"" she said.Now free, Vasundhara wants the Ugandan government to be held accountable for what she calls an unjust persecution. ""This is up to the Ugandan government to correct its mistakes. We have invested in their country for years, and this is how they treat us?"" she said.As she reviews legal options, her case has raised global concerns over police corruption and human rights violations in Uganda.","Vasundhara oswal was detained in a cell after providing a statement and was asked to pay usd 30,000 and surrender her passport as part of a police bond.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Four-time Congress MP Shashi Tharoor appears to be growing increasingly disillusioned with the party, following what he perceives as a continued sidelining by the high command. His recent public criticism of a leadership vacuum in Kerala Congress and a meeting with Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi to discuss his role in the party have fuelled speculation about his future within the organisation.However, Congress functionaries in Kerala maintained that Tharoor will not quit the party. ""I don't believe Tharoor will leave the party or join CPM,"" KPCC president K Sudhakaran said Sunday. Tharoor has staked a claim for chief ministership if Congress is voted to office in Kerala assembly elections next year. He has asserted that several surveys rank him as the most acceptable functionary among Congress stalwarts in state, signalling his reluctance to remain a passive MP & CWC member.The Thiruvananthapuram MP 's remarks have put the party's state brass in an uncomfortable position. Sudhakaran, who had supported Tharoor, has cautioned him against crossing party lines. ""Responding through the media was not the right approach for Tharoor. He has time to rectify the mistakes he made. It was most unfortunate that he has made comments against the interest of the party through media. One should not cross the boundaries,"" Sudhakaran said.CWC member Ramesh Chennithala defended the party's treatment of Tharoor, pointing out that he had been given multiple opportunities. ""Congress needs Tharoor and that was the reason why he was made MP four times and a central minister once. He was also given important positions in the party's supreme bodies,"" he said.Chennithala recalled how he had invited Tharoor to join Congress when he returned from UN and encouraged him to contest from Palakkad LS constituency. He said Tharoor was given recognition within the party, including invitation to a KPCC general body meeting even when he was not a member.Congress' K Muraleedharan dismissed Tharoor's claims of a leadership vacuum in Kerala. ""His services should be utilised at the national level, especially to woo youngsters to the party.

Centre bans manufacture & export of 2 drugs ‘fuelling’ W Africa opioid crisis

TOI CORRESPONDENT FROM LONDON/MUMBAI: A media expose on a Maharashtra-based pharma company accused of illegally manufacturing unlicensed, addictive opioids and exporting them to West Africa led to a joint raid by state and central drug inspectors over the weekend and the announcement of curbs on the manufacturing and export of such products.The raid on Aveo Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd's facility and warehouse in Boisar under Palghar district followed a BBC World Service documentary titled ' India's Opioid Kings '. It examined the public health crisis caused by pills made of a deadly cocktail of tapentadol (a powerful opioid) and carisoprodol (an addictive muscle relaxant), packaged as legitimate licensed medicines, in countries such as Nigeria and Ghana.This drug combination is not licensed for use anywhere in the world. ""They are coming in from India and that has become a big menace in Nigeria,"" a member of Nigeria's drug enforcement agency told BBC.Maharashtra FDA officials said the entire stock was seized, and further production was immediately halted. The company was also slapped with a showcause.On Friday, the Centre issued directives to all states to revoke the no-objection certificate (NOC) for export and the manufacturing licences for tapentadol, carisoprodol, and other similar products.Speaking to TOI, an FDA official said, ""Aveo has been on our radar for the past few months. We served them notice in October for non-matching of their manufacturing and distribution records. Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) is responsible for testing the exports as per their protocols, and the state does not play a role. Both the medicines have their use separately, but their combination is harmful, and it is already banned in India.""Monish Bhalla, former senior officer of India's Narcotics Control Bureau, said, ""The checks and balances on imports in India are far more stringent than for exports.""Aveo is breaking Indian law because it is not meeting import requirements in Ghana, but ""the Indian authorities pay little attention to pharma drugs not sold in India,"" the documentary states.An undercover BBC reporter went to Aveo Pharmaceuticals' factory posing as a businessman looking to supply opioids to Nigeria and met the managing director Vinod Kumar Sharma. Whilst being plied with snacks and Bisleri, Sharma showed him the pills boxed under different brand names such as Taamdol 225mg and Taramaking 250, all made from the same dangerous cocktail.Sharma told the reporter, ""This is very harmful for their health, but the customer cannot understand that. He wants to relax. Any medicine can be misused. This is a very harmful product in their hands, but nowadays this is business. I can clear from our customs, means India. You can clear from your side.""He told the reporter that he can ship them to Ghana and they can enter Nigeria from there. The drugs he shows are the same ones that have been seized by the police in West African nations because they are illegal. Sharma also boasted that his factory is ""WHO certified"".The documentary also focuses on a drug rehabilitation centre in Nigeria where patients addicted to these opioids live in appalling conditions with their legs chained together, sleeping on the floor with no running water. In Tamale, Ghana, local city chief Alhassan Maham has created a citizens' task force of 100 volunteers whose mission is to raid and arrest the drug dealers and take these illegal opioids off the streets. But the problem is: India is manufacturing them faster than they can do that.CDSCO told the BBC it has taken the matter up with countries in West Africa and will take immediate action against any pharmaceutical firm involved in malpractice.While Sharma did not respond to TOI requests, the company in a statement said that the allegations against it were baseless and without merit. The company added that it adhered to the rules and regulations set by various regulatory authorities to manufacture and export its products.","Maharashtra fda officials said the entire stock was seized, and further production was immediately halted.

NEW DELHI: Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan 's seat on the Air India airbus that flew him Bhopal-Delhi Saturday was not ""broken"". That, sources say, is the new light seat increasingly chosen by airlines to keep aircraft weight low and help save fuel burn with the lean cushion taking all the passenger weight, giving the effect of being sunken.""The seat was reclining and not broken. It has been checked by engineers. But the lean cushioning often gives a sunken feel, especially during turbulence when flyers may feel the seat is moving,"" said sources. A senior DGCA official said on Sunday evening Air India was yet to submit its report on the Union minister's experience.The former Madhya Pradesh CM wrote on X Saturday: ""I had booked a ticket on AI 436. I was allotted seat number 8C. I went and sat on the seat, the seat was broken and sunken in. Sitting was uncomfortable.... Not just one, there are more such seats....""It is learnt that a number of seats had ""sunken"" or thinned cushioning. The minister had written on X: ""After charging passengers full amount, seating them on a bad and uncomfortable seat is unethical. Is this not cheating the passengers? Will Air India management take steps so that in the future no passenger faces such discomfort, or will it keep taking advantage of passengers' urgency to reach their destination?"" Air India has apologised to Chouhan.With the advent of low cost carriers, air travel is no longer a luxury. The comfort factor, once associated with flying, is gradually giving way to a more frugal onboard experience. Light seats with low cushioning on aircraft are one of the new realities of contemporary aviation.","Shivraj singh chouhan's seat on the air india airbus that flew him bhopal-delhi saturday was not ""broken"" that, sources say, is the new light seat increasingly chosen by airlines to keep aircraft weight low and help save fuel burn.

The DMK demands the total withdrawal of this Bill and appeals to the Union govt to respect the autonomy of the legal profession,” Stalin said in the post.Stalin’s attack on Centre comes in the backdrop of a political slugfest between DMK and the BJP-led Union govt over New Education Policy (NEP). Stalin has been alleging that NEP will not be implemented in TN as it imposes Hindi and intrudes into the state's education policy.Scaling up the attack on the BJP, Stalin said the Advocates Amendment Bill was also against Tamil.“The BJP’s aversion to Tamil is evident in this Bill, as it wants to rename the Bar Council of TamilNadu and Puducherry as the Bar Council of Madras. TN is not just a name; it is our identity,” Stalin said.He said the BJP govt has been systematically undermining the independence of the judiciary since 2014 when it came to power. This was done first by trying to hijack judicial appointments through the National Judicial Appointments Commission and then by ignoring the collegium's recommendations for judicial appointments and transfers, he said.“Now, by seeking control over bar councils, it aims to weaken judicial independence ,” he added.Earlier, Stalin said Tamil Nadu is losing out to other states in the delimitation exercise due to population control. Speaking at a marriage function of a DMK functionary here, Stalin said that TN was in a disadvantageous position due to its efficient implementation of population control measures as less population means fewer parliamentary seats in the delimitation exercise. Nevertheless, he urged people to limit the number of their children.He also reiterated that TN will not adopt the three language policy even if it means losing out ₹10,000 crore.",Stalin’s attack on centre comes in the backdrop of a political slugfest between dmk and the bjp-led union govt.

Silt, water pose challenge for rescue team at Telangana tunnel

HYDERABAD: Six members of the team behind the heroic Nov 2023 Silkyara tunnel rescue operation in Uttarakhand joined the Army, NDRF, SDRF and local agencies on Sunday in accelerated efforts to save the eight workers - two of them engineers - trapped inside a collapsed portion of Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) in Telangana's Nagarkurnool district, reports Roushan Ali.As the clock ticked on an operation that yielded little in over 36 hours, families of the trapped men and agencies trying to reach them drew hope from the rescue of 41 workers confined for 17 days inside the Silkyara Bend-Barkot tunnel after a portion had caved in.Fears centred around the possibility of debris, including segments of the tunnel's concrete slab, having fallen on the eight workers. There was no contact with any of the trapped men until late Sunday, although rescue teams were stationed just outside the roof collapse site 13.5km inside the tunnel.The teams couldn't make any headway beyond the tunnel boring machine and debris because of the twin barriers of silt and water.Minister Jupally Krishna Rao, who is supervising the rescue effort along with his colleague N Uttam Kumar Reddy, said there was waterlogging along a 2km stretch leading to the collapse point. ""Getting through this is a challenging task. We have to flush out the water before the equipment can push ahead. Only then can removal of debris start. Additional motors have been brought to speed up water removal,"" he said.An irrigation department official said there was hardly 5 to 10 metres of space left where the eight workers were believed to be trapped.""The Telangana govt has requisitioned the Uttarakhand tunnel rescue team along with rat-hole miners to assist in the operation because they have the expertise. Better to have more hands in such a situation. We hope all lives will be saved,"" he added.The ground above the tunnel is 400 metres or nearly half a kilometre in height. Agencies involved in the operation are exploring all possible options to find the easiest exit for the trapped workers.","Silt, water pose challenge for rescue team at telangana tunnel.

I think the truth will come out in the CAG report. Whether it is education, liquor, or Sheesh Mahal, many such issues will be raised in the House,"" said Khurana.Khurana criticized AAP for not presenting the report earlier, emphasizing that the new BJP-led government would operate according to constitutional norms.""The 8th assembly formed yesterday and its first session will begin tomorrow with the oath of the MLAs and the election of the Speaker and the next day the CAG report will be tabled.

They said that in the first cabinet meeting, a resolution would be passed that every woman in Delhi would get Rs 2500 per month in her account,"" Kakkar said.Kakkar pointed out that BJP had not addressed their promises in their first cabinet meeting, contrasting this with AAP's record of fulfilling their commitments when they came to power.","Bjp to present comptroller and auditor general's report in delhi assembly on february 25.
