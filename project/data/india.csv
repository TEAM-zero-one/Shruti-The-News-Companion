We didn’t accept it either. But see how the situation changed in Leh. Leh celebrated at the time.

Gadget tips for monsoon: What to do and what to avoid this rainy season

NEW DELHI: The four-month summer (southwest) monsoon season ended on Tuesday with India reporting 8% more than normal rainfall. East & northeast India, however, reported a huge deficit of more than 20% and witnessed the second lowest rainfall year in the rainy season since 1901. The country as a whole, on the other hand, saw fifth highest rainfall this year since 2001 and 38th highest since 1901.“Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Meghalaya saw deficient rainfall in three of the four monsoon months. The lowest rainfall in the monsoon season in the region was recorded in 2013,” IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said.He said, “Rainfall over east & northeast India has been deficient in many years in recent times. There is a trend that shows that the rainfall over this region is decreasing since 2020. Studies also show that rainfall over the region has decreased in the last 20 years.”Though the ‘above normal’ monsoon season was marked by many disasters, including cloudburst, landslides, floods and mudslides, specifically in northwest India (Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir), the good rains helped farmers in increasing their acreage of Kharif (summer sown) crops not just more than last year but also more than the normal sown area of the season.The agriculture ministry's latest data, released on Monday, shows that the country reported an overall acreage of 1,120 lakh hectares this Kharif season, which is 24 lakh hectares more than normal acreage and seven lakh hectares more than the acreage in 2024. It raises a hope of record foodgrains during the 2025-26 crop year, even as few lakh hectares of farm land got submerged in floods in Punjab and other states.The monsoon season technically ended on Tuesday, but certain parts of the country will continue to report rainfall for a couple of more weeks till the complete withdrawal of the monsoon mid-Oct. The delay in complete withdrawal of the monsoon may delay the onset of northeast (winter) monsoon in Peninsular India.Mohapatra said most parts of the country are expected to receive above-normal rainfall during the post-summer monsoon season (October to December), except for some areas in northwest India, where rainfall is likely to be normal to below-normal.In October alone, the country is expected to receive 15% more than normal rainfall.The met department’s forecast suggests that the winter monsoon (October to December) rainfall over south Peninsular India, comprising five meteorological subdivisions of Tamil Nadu, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Rayalaseema, Kerala and South Interior Karnataka, is most likely to be above normal (more than 112% of the long period average).Asked about the possibility of early winter arrival due to developing La Nina conditions, Mohapatra said it would be premature to predict early winter onset at this juncture as the status of colder weather depends on multiple dynamic meteorological factors.La Nina (means Little Girl in Spanish) is a climate pattern associated with the periodic cooling of ocean surface temperatures in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific. La Nina is linked to good monsoon rainfall in the Indian sub-continent. In the La Nina year, the winter in India is invariably colder than normal.The IMD chief said maximum (day) temperatures in October are likely to be above normal in most parts of east-northeast and northwest India whereas “normal to below-normal” maximum temperatures are expected in other regions of the country during the month.","The four-month summer (southwest) monsoon season ended on tuesday with india reporting 8% more than normal rainfall. East & northeast india, however, reported a huge deficit of more than 20% and witnessed the second lowest rainfall year in the rainy season since 1901.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124245103,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-21364,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

There are wide regional variations when it comes to suicides. While Kerala tops the list at 30.6 per lakh population, Bihar has the lowest suicide rate in the country at 0.7.But one factor stands out sharply: income. A vast majority of victims came from households earning less than Rs 1 lakh a year, showing how poverty and financial insecurity push people to the edge. The less educated are also more vulnerable. More than four in five victims had not studied beyond higher secondary school.Men in their 30s and early 40s were the most affected, while among women the highest toll fell on those aged 18 to 30. Strikingly, among children under 18, more girls died by suicide than boys, as opposed to the trend visible in every other age group.","Kerala tops the list at 30.6 per lakh population, bihar has the lowest suicide rate in the country at 0.7.

States high on crime, low on murders

Going by the latest report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Delhi is the country’s crime capital. Per lakh population, 1508.9 cases of IPC were recorded in 2023. Kerala is second on this list with 721.7 IPC cases per lakh population. Among major states and UTs, Jharkhand had the fewest reported cases at 126.6 per lakh population.That would make Delhi almost 12 times more unsafe than Jharkhand, and Kerala about six times so. But — and this is where the story takes an unexpected twist — the chances of getting murdered in Jharkhand is almost one and a half times more than in Delhi, and nearly three times higher than in Kerala.So, are we to believe that Jharkhand has a fantastic record in controlling all other crimes except the most heinous one — murder? On the contrary, this is likely a case of gross under-reporting. Delhi and Kerala have much better policing, and a much more rigorous reporting of crime.Delhi is ranked first in overall crime, but is eighth when it comes to murders. Kerala is ranked second in overall crime and 22nd in murder. Jharkhand, on the other hand, is ranked 22nd in overall crime and ranks first in murder. Similarly, Punjab and Assam are ranked 19th and 20th in overall crime and 7th and 4th in murder.Haryana, Telangana, Odisha and Tamil Nadu have the minimum gap in their overall crime rate and the rate of murder and culpable homicide, probably indicating a better capture of both data sets.","Delhi is ranked first in overall crime, but is eighth when it comes to murders.

Accidental deaths

NEW DELHI: A staggering 1,217 lives were lost daily in accidents in 2023, an increase of around 3% over the previous year, according to the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report.While fatalities due to forces of nature, such as lightning, avalanche, flood and landslide, saw a decline of nearly 20%, the overall increase in deaths — more than 4.4 lakh in 2023 — was on account of other reasons, like road and rail accidents , electrocution, poisoning, sudden deaths, stampede, falls and deaths by animals.Traffic accidents — road and rail — had the maximum share of around 45% of all such deaths, followed by sudden deaths (14.3%) and drowning (8.5%) in 2023, data showed.While road crashes claimed around 1.74 lakh lives — a little more than the road transport ministry’s report of 1.73 lakh for the same period — deaths on railway track and crossings claimed 24,000 lives. Speeding was reason for nearly 59% of all road fatalities.The report mentioned that Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh reported maximum fatalities in accidents at railway crossings, accounting for 1,007 deaths, which is 45% of the total 2,242 fatalities in this category.In the case rail accidents — a different category under the NCRB — 15,878 (73%) of 21,803 deaths were due to “fall from trains or collision with people at track”. Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh reported the maximum number of fatalities in rail accidents — 3,445 and 3,149 respectively.In 2023, among all rail accidents, there were 56 cases due to fault of driver while another 43 mishaps took place due to mechanical defects, such as poor design, track faults, bridge or tunnel collapse.The report stated that there was a 12.3% increase in sudden deaths, which includes heart attacks, in 2023 over the previous year. In total, 63,609 people died due to sudden deaths. Data showed that heart attacks claimed 35,637 lives in 2023 compared to 32,410 in 2022. There was also a 45% spike in the number of people killed in stampedes — which claimed 32 lives — in 2023.The National Crime Records Bureau data collated from states and UTs showed that 1,742 people were killed by animals in 2023, which was 15.4% more than that of 2022.","A staggering 1,217 lives were lost daily in accidents in 2023, an increase of around 3% over the previous year.

Bihar SIR: SC Slams Political Parties’ Silence, Directs Poll Panel To Accept Aadhaar Or 11 Documents

Revision Done,Stage Set ForState Poll Dates

3.7L electors, declared ‘ineligible’, deleted from EC’s Bihar draft roll

PATNA: Bihar will have a total electorate of 7.4 crore when state assembly elections are held, according to the final electoral roll published on Tuesday by the Election Commission of India . Overall, the voter count has dropped by 6%.The final number of voters arrived at after completion of the special intensive revision (SIR) has fallen by about 47 lakh from the 7.9 crore it was on June 24, before the exercise. But it has 17.9 lakh more voters compared to the draft roll, which had 7.2 crore on Aug 1 after 65 lakh names were deleted, show details issued by EC.The release of the rolls kicked off the drill for announcement of poll dates. EC had indicated CEC Gyanesh Kumar and his two colleagues would visit Bihar before announcement of dates, around Oct 5-6.The names of another 3.7 lakh electors, declared “ineligible”, were deleted from the draft list, while 21.5 lakh new ones were added, taking the final figure to 7.4 crore. There may be a small change in the final number as supplementary lists are published during the poll process.While the number of names removed is far less than what was being anticipated, a break-up of caste- and community-wise deletions will determine the response of parties to the SIR process carried out by the EC.The exercise dominated the buildup to the polls, relegating regular issues to the periphery. On Tuesday, the responses of opponents of SIR were muted in comparison to the earlier high-wattage protests against the exercise.However, that might change. EC said those eligible and wanting their names included in theroll could still do so up to 10 days before the last date for filing nominations for the assembly polls. Those not satisfied can file a first appeal with the district magistrate under Section 24 of the Representation of the People Act, 1950, and a second appeal before the chief electoral officer, it said.The opposition had objected strongly to the SIR after the names of 65 lakh voters were initially dropped from the electoral roll on various grounds. The first major protest had been Congress MP Rahul Gandhi’s statewide ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ from Sasaram, a Dalit bastion, on Aug 17, as the entire opposition rallied behind him. He was supported by RJD neta Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, CPI-ML general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) chief Mukesh Sahani, among others.","Bihar will have a total electorate of 7.4 crore when state assembly elections are held.
