Creating fear to stop people helping law is a terror act: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/creating-fear-to-stop-people-helping-law-is-a-terror-act-supreme-court/articleshow/122540854.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Indicating that an offence cannot be said to be a terror act only if an accused is convicted under an anti-terror law, Supreme Court on Tuesday said creating an atmosphere of fear to prevent people from taking the side of law by killing an army informer is also a terrorist act despite anti-terror law not being invoked in the case.A bench comprising Justices Ahsanuddin Amanullah and S V N Bhatti did not agree that the killing of three civilians, including the army informer, in J&K with an AK-47 was not a terror act because the conviction was not secured under an anti-terror law, and expressed its reservation in entertaining a remission plea of a convict who has spent 27 years in jail in the case.Prisoner Ghulam Mohammad Bhat took the stand that he was not convicted under an anti-terror law, but only under the Indian Penal Code for murder, and therefore, his act cannot be termed a terrorist act. The J&K government told SC that a convict undergoing life imprisonment for a terror act was not entitled for remission under state policy.Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for the prisoner, said Bhat was convicted only under IPC section 302 (murder) and the Arms Act, and not under the then anti-terror legislation TADA. ""Nothing was proved in court to attract TADA provisions. The trial court or the HC never found it to be a terrorist act,"" he said.Additional solicitor general K M Natraj, appearing for the J&K government, submitted that explosive devices, including a weapon to launch grenades, were also reportedly recovered from the scene of incident and it was an act of terror, it was not a simple murder.Agreeing with Gonsalves, the bench said, ""If you want to create fear among people to ensure that no one approaches authorities against the illegal act then it is a terror act and we cannot close our eyes. ""This was done to create havoc to ensure that no one dares to side with the law, then it certainly carries the characteristics of a terrorist act and remission cannot be granted under the policy. You have to challenge the remission policy. ""SC, however, allowed Gonsalves's plea to be allowed to challenge the J&K remission policy within the ongoing proceedings.","Supreme court says creating an atmosphere of fear to prevent people from taking the side of law is also a terrorist act.

‘Why don’t you feed them at home?’ SC pulls up Noida man over feeding stray dogs; flags safety risks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-dont-you-feed-them-at-home-sc-pulls-up-noida-man-over-feeding-stray-dogs-flags-safety-risks/articleshow/122499245.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday pulled up a petitioner who claimed he was being harassed for feeding street dogs in Noida. A bench of justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta asked him why he couldn’t feed the animals at home.“Why don’t you feed them in your own house? Nobody is stopping you,” the bench said, adding, “Should every lane and every road be kept open just for large-hearted people? There’s space for animals, but no space for humans.”The petitioner’s lawyer argued that his client was following the Animal Birth Control Rules, 2023. Under Rule 20, the local residents' body or municipality is responsible for designating feeding spots for community animals. The lawyer said Noida authorities weren’t doing so, unlike Greater Noida.In response, the court suggested opening a shelter at home to feed the dogs. It also raised safety concerns, saying morning walkers and two-wheeler riders were often at risk due to street dogs. “Try going cycling in the morning and see what happens,” the court said.The plea pertains to a March 2025 Allahabad High Court order, in which the petitioner requested the proper implementation of the rules and protection from harassment.The high court had noted the need to protect both animals and people, saying that while stray dogs should be safeguarded under the law, public safety must also be considered. It cited recent attacks by dogs that led to serious injuries and even deaths.The high court had asked authorities to be sensitive to both the petitioner’s concerns and those of the general public. It directed them to ensure proper measures were taken to protect both street dogs and pedestrians.","A bench of justices vikram nath and sandeep mehta asked him why he couldn’t feed the animals at home.

In July 2023, the court had stayed similar directives by the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, which required food sellers and hawkers to publicly display the names of owners and staff.“We deem it appropriate to pass interim order prohibiting the enforcement of the impugned directives,” the court had said in that earlier order, adding that vendors may only be asked to disclose the kind of food being served, not the identity of those running the establishments.The current petition alleges that the QR code measure is a “wilful disobedience” of the court's previous ruling. “These steps effectively serve the same unconstitutional end through digital means,” it said, citing media reports confirming that the codes allow customers to access ownership details.It further warns of the “grave and imminent risk” of harm to the rights of affected vendors, particularly those from minority communities. “Vague and overbroad directives deliberately mix up licensing requirements with the unlawful demand to display religious identity, and leave scope for violent enforcement… by vigilante groups and authorities,” the plea added.The petitioners have urged the court to immediately restrain the Uttar Pradesh government from continuing what they call an indirect implementation of a previously blocked policy.",Supreme court issues notice to the uttar pradesh government on a batch of petitions.

Yes No

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday told the Supreme Court that it has limited ability to intervene in the case of Nimisha Priya, an Indian nurse from Kerala who is facing execution in Yemen for murder, calling it a “very complex issue” with few diplomatic levers available.Appearing before a bench headed by Justice Sandeep Mehta, the Attorney general of India (AGI) said, “There’s no way we can know what’s happening [in Yemen].” He added that the government is in touch with Yemeni authorities, including the public prosecutor, and is trying to delay Priya’s execution while discussions continue.The court was informed that the only viable option left to save Priya’s life is a blood money, settlement, provided the family of the deceased Yemeni national is willing to accept it. “The parties may apprise the Court on the next date about the status of the case,” the bench noted in its order while scheduling the next hearing for July 18.Nimisha Priya, who has been imprisoned since 2017, is currently being held in Sana’a Central Prison and is tentatively set to be executed on Tuesday, July 16. The apex court took up the matter after senior advocate Ragenth Basant mentioned it for urgent hearing. The plea, filed by the save Nimisha Priya action council, seeks government intervention via diplomatic channels.The court had earlier directed that a copy of the petition be served to the AGI and asked the Centre to inform the court of the steps taken so far.According to news agency PTI, a source said, ""The family of the deceased, Talal Abdo Mehdi, is not even willing to accept blood money. All legal efforts have been made for Nimisha Priya, but the allegations against her were so grave that all efforts have failed.""Priya, a nurse from Kollengode in Kerala’s Palakkad district, moved to Yemen in 2008 and worked in hospitals before opening her own clinic. In 2017, she reportedly got into a dispute with her business partner, Talal Abdo Mahdi, over alleged misappropriation of funds. According to her family, she injected him with sedatives to recover her confiscated passport, but the dosage led to his death.Priya was arrested while attempting to flee the country and was convicted of murder in 2018. A trial court in Sanaa sentenced her to death in 2020, and Yemen’s Supreme Judicial Council upheld the verdict in November 2023. However, the Council also kept open the option of a blood money settlement, in accordance with Sharia law.Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has also urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to act immediately. In a letter sent Sunday, Vijayan wrote, “Considering the fact that this is a case deserving sympathy, I appeal to the Hon’ble Prime Minister to take up the matter and intervene with the authorities concerned to save the life of Smt. Nimisha Priya.” He referred to earlier appeals made in February and March 2025.Priya’s mother, Prema Kumari, has travelled to Yemen in an attempt to negotiate a blood money settlement. Her efforts have been supported by the Save Nimisha Priya International action council, a collective of NRI social workers operating in Yemen.","Nimisha priya, an indian nurse from kerala, is facing execution in yemen for murder.

NEW DELHI: Flagging the ""perceived reluctance"" of senior bureaucrats to grant appointments to persons not in govt, cabinet secretary T V Somanathan has written to all secretaries saying that such interactions can give insights into ground realities and clarify misunderstandings about government policies or intentions.In the letter to secretaries, Somanathan urged senior officials across ministries to hold such meetings in offices and ""not in clubs, hotels"". He said, ""Meeting visitors can provide insights into the actual state of affairs on the ground, help identify or clarify miscommunications or misunderstandings about government policy or intentions, offer access to new ideas, and present opportunities to correct mistakes"".He requested officials ""to endeavour to be accessible to non-officials who may seek to meet you in connection with work of your ministry/department"". If, out of ""precaution"", any official found it necessary, they could ask another official to be present at such a meeting.Somanathan said people from various sections of society had told him that there is a ""perceived reluctance"" among several secretaries of Union government and other senior officials to grant such appointments.The top bureaucrat said that a meeting should not be denied based on an individual's profession or background - like a contractor, a member of a trade union, political party, or NGO, a private sector or a chamber of commerce employee, or someone under investigation by a law enforcement agency, having a dispute with the department on a contractual matter and/or if the matter is sub judice or under arbitration.","Cabinet secretary t v somanathan has written to all secretaries.

NEW DELHI: The Unique Identification Authority of India has urged parents to update the Aadhaar biometrics of children between five and seven years.""Timely completion of mandatory biometric update is an essential requirement for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of biometric data of children. If the MBU is not completed even after seven years of age, the Aadhaar number may be deactivated, as per the existing rules,"" the agency said in a statement.This is required to ensure seamless access to school admissions, entrance exams and other benefits such as direct benefit transfer, it added.A child under five years is enrolled for Aadhaar by providing photograph, name, date of birth, gender, address and documents of proof, but fingerprints and iris biometrics are not captured as these are not mature at that age. As a result, when the child turns five, fingerprints, iris and photo need to be updated. ""If the child performs the MBU between age of five and seven years, it is free of cost. But after seven years of age, there is a prescribed fee of Rs 100 only,"" the statement said.A second update is required when child turns 15.","The unique identification authority of india has urged parents to update the biometrics of children between five and seven years.

Yemen has stayed the execution of nurse

Nimisha Priya

in a murder case, with hope resting on the kin of the deceased agreeing to settle for indemnity

What is Sharia?

What is Blood Money?

Do the guilty walk free after payment of Blood Money?

How many countries follow Sharia Law?

The Centre has told the Supreme Court that payment of blood money is the only option left for saving Kerala-origin nurse Nimisha Priya from the death row in Yemen. Such payments are permitted under Sharia law, the system of jurisprudence practised in many Islamic countries. Here's how it works:Sharia is an Arabic term meaning ""the way"" or ""the correct path"". It embodies rules and principles derived from the Quran, the Islamic holy book that is regarded as the direct word of God, and the Hadith, which represent the sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad. Sharia, thus, is taken to lay down how Muslims should conduct themselves in their personal lives, social and commercial dealings, and spiritual pursuits.The legal dimension of Sharia is based on interpretations by Islamic jurists through a process known as 'fiqh'. These interpretations ensure the adaptability of precepts of the Sharia to evolving practical realities. So, while Sharia is not synonymous with Islamic law, the latter is derived from the Sharia based on fiqh. Given that interpretations stretch across time and geographies, there can be varying reckoning of Islamic laws based on the Sharia.The concept of retaliation is recognised in Sharia law based on 'qisas', or the principle of 'an eye for an eye'. In the case of murder, it means that the kin of the victim can demand death as punishment for the culprit. However, Sharia also allows for payment of 'diya', that is, compensation or indemnity, to the kin of the victim.Diya is permitted in cases where the kin of the victim waive their right to qisas and agree to settle for blood money. It is a right reserved for the victim's kin and can't be exercised by the state or govt on their behalf. That's why the campaign to save Nimisha Priya is appealing to the kin of the man she has been convicted of killing in Yemen. Their reported insistence on death for her is the hurdle to her being spared the death penalty. Different countries and jurisdictions can prescribe varying quanta of diya depending on the case and the victim.While it spares a culprit death as punishment for taking a life, it is debatable whether acceptance of diya by the victim's family amounts to an official pardon. Some experts say that Islamic jurisprudence has not clearly addressed this point. However, there are instances where a culprit has been taken off death row but kept in prison after the payment of diya. A notable example is the case of Abdul Rahim of Kerala.Convicted in Saudi Arabia for causing the death of his employer's son, Rahim obtained a pardon from the victim's family following the payment of a hefty ransom raised through a massive fundraising effort. However, the case was not closed after this and he was sentenced to 20 years in jail. The verdict took into account time spent in jail. So, while the crime occurred in 2006, and the pardon received in 2018, he is expected to be released only next year.There are about 50 Muslim-majority countries in the world and most are deemed to incorporate elements of Sharia law in their legal systems. Even when such a country has opted for a secular jurisprudence, there can be aspects - like family or personal laws - that are based on the Sharia.But the degree to which Sharia informs legal principles can vary widely. Further, not all Muslim-majority countries may carry out the form of extreme punishments, known as hudud, handed down for crimes such as adultery, rape, homosexuality, theft and murder.","Yemen has stayed the execution of nurse nimisha priya in a murder case, with hope resting on the kin of the deceased agreeing to settle for indemnity.
