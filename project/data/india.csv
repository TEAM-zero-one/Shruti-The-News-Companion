NMC drops MBBS nod for Vaishno Devi College; admitted med students to be moved to other J&K colleges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nmc-drops-mbbs-nod-for-vaishno-devi-college-admitted-med-students-to-be-moved-to-other-jk-colleges/articleshow/126385151.cms,"NEW DELHI: The National Medical Commission’s Medical Assessment and Rating Board (MARB) has withdrawn the Letter of Permission (LoP) granted to the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence to run an MBBS course with 50 seats for the 2025-26 academic year, after a surprise inspection found serious violations of minimum standards.The January 6 order takes immediate effect. NMC officials said the institute was noncompliant with key requirements, including infrastructure and faculty strength, following multiple complaints.To safeguard students already admitted for 2025-26, authorities have been directed to shift them to other medical colleges in J&K as supernumerary seats, as per norms.The move comes amid wider scrutiny of the college. Earlier, NMC had rejected institute’s request to place all 50 MBBS seats under All-India Quota through Medical Counselling Committee, saying seat-sharing policy cannot be altered for a single institution.Located near the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi shrine in Reasi, the institute was sanctioned 50 MBBS seats on Sept 8, 2025 and began operations in Nov from administrative block of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University.The college has also faced protests from Hindu organisations over selection of 43 students from a particular community in its first batch of 50, with allegations that the institute is largely funded by devotees of another faith. College officials said all admitted students were from J&K.With LoP withdrawn, future of institute’s first MBBS batch hinges on swift relocation of students to other colleges.","The national medical commission’s medical assessment and rating board (marb) has withdrawn the letter of permission (lop) granted to the shri mata vaishno devi institute of medical excellence.

Intellectually disabled woman’s testimony gets rapist 10-year RI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/intellectually-disabled-womans-testimony-gets-rapist-10-year-ri/articleshow/126384966.cms,"MUMBAI: Relying on Supreme Court’s observation that the testimony of a person with a disability can’t be considered weak or inferior only because they interact with the world in a different manner, a sessions court recently sentenced a 35-year-old salon worker to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment for abduction and rape of a woman with moderate intellectual disability in 2019, marking a rare conviction under Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act.Calling the victim a “sterling witness”, judge Surekha A Sinha found the man guilty on multiple counts, including rape under IPC. He was given one year in jail under Section 92(b) of Disabilities Act (assaulting or using force against a person with a disability). The sentences are to run concurrently.Psychiatrists deposed that while the woman was 25 years old physically, her social age was around seven years and two months, with an IQ of 36.According to the prosecution, on April 29, 2019, the survivor’s mother noticed that she had gone missing after the family returned from voting in the Lok Sabha polls. When the woman returned home shortly after, she was in tears and revealed her assault. She said while playing in a nearby lane, the accused caught her hand and forcibly took her to the mezzanine floor of his residence. There, he threatened her with a knife, gagged her with a pillow, and sexually assaulted her.To destroy evidence, she said, the man washed her with soap.During trial, special public prosecutor Geeta Sharma examined 14 witnesses. While forensic reports were inconclusive — a result the prosecution attributed to the accused washing the victim after the assault — medical experts provided critical testimony. Doctors confirmed that the victim had suffered physical trauma consistent with sexual assault.The defence said the case was built on hearsay and cited minor discrepancies in the testimony. The judge rejected these, saying the testimony of a person with a disability must be treated with “utmost sensitivity”. “Minor discrepancies and contradictions are not fatal to the case of prosecution. Courts cannot cling to a fossil formula and insist upon corroboration even if, taken as a whole, the case spoken of by the victim of sex crime strikes the judicial mind as probable. ”","A sessions court recently sentenced a 35-year-old salon worker to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment for abduction and rape of a woman with moderate intellectual disability in 2019.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab and Haryana HC denied bail to Gurmukh Singh — son of former Akal Takht jathedar Jasbir Singh Rode — and Gurmej Singh in a narco-terrorism case related to smuggling of arms, explosives (including tiffin bombs), and narcotics from Pakistan via drones to fund terror activities in Punjab and other parts of India.A division bench of Justice Gurvinder Singh Gill and Justice Ramesh Kumari said sponsoring terrorism was an “expensive affair” and the charge was of heroin being smuggled into the country, along with arms and ammunition, to fund terror activities.“Facts brought on record by NIA , prima facie, prove the involvement of appellants in terror activities. Trial is in progress. Since they have links with persons across the border, who fund their activities, there are also chances of their absconding from trial,” HC said. It ordered an expeditious trial and directed police and prosecution to complete evidence in a timely manner.NIA’s prime allegations are that the accused were part of a larger conspiracy involving “receipt, concealment, and distribution of arms, explosives, and terror funds intended to revive militancy in Punjab”. The agency alleged multiple consignments were collected between June and Aug 2021, concealed at locations across Punjab that were shared through encrypted messaging platforms.The agency claimed to have recovered grenades, detonators, pistols, cartridges, explosive materials, large sums of cash, multiple passports, and vehicles from Gurmukh.Gurmukh’s counsel argued he was falsely implicated due to his family background and political reasons, and claimed there was no direct recovery from his possession. NIA asserted that evidence clearly pointed to his role in facilitating terror activities.The agency submitted the appellants were allegedly in contact with Lakhbir Singh Rode alias Baba, a declared terrorist and chief of a banned organisation.","Punjab and haryana hc denied bail to gurmukh singh, son of former akal takht jathedar jasbir singh rode.

NEW DELHI: At a time when home minister Amit Shah has vowed to eradicate Left-wing extremism by March-end, Supreme Court on Tuesday said success against Naxalites could not be based on arrests alone and there must be adequate courts and infrastructure for speedy trial of the arrested ultras.One Kailash Ramchandani was arrested in June 2019 for being the person who signalled Naxalites to trigger an IED blast that killed 15 police personnel at Gadchiroli in Maharashtra. He was also accused of supplying material used in IED and walkie talkies to the extremists through a small shop used as a front.Senior advocate Trideep Pais told SC there were scores of cases pending before the same special judge where Ramchandani’s case was being heard and the prosecution had listed 146 witnesses of which only one has been examined in the last three months. Pais said the accused had no criminal antecedents and pleaded for bail, saying he had been in custody for six-and-a-half years.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi the blast was triggered on the signal given by the accused and his hands were red with the blood of 15 police personnel.The bench said, “Your success story against Left-wing extremism cannot be based on arrests alone.There must be speedy trial, which is possible only when govt sets up exclusive special courts to try cases of this nature. Since there are many cases pending before the same trial judge and prosecution has cited many witnesses, the trial is not going to be concluded in the near future.”But the bench was cautious in granting only interim bail to the accused with the condition that he would be under constant watch of police. “If he attempts to get in touch with his associates among Naxalites, the interim bail would be liable to be cancelled,” it said and asked him to report to the police station near his home once a week.",One kailash ramchandani was arrested in june 2019 for being the person who signalled naxalites to trigger an ied blast.

Many high courts yet to frame guidelines against sexual harassment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/many-high-courts-yet-to-frame-guidelines-against-sexual-harassment/articleshow/126384658.cms,"‘Lack of redressal mechanism undermines women’s rights’



NEW DELHI: Nearly three decades after Supreme Court’s Vishaka judgment mandating a mechanism against the sexual harassment of women at workplaces, it remains unimplemented by many high courts, including Calcutta, Patna, Orissa, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Allahabad and Uttarakhand.Appearing for PIL petitioner Geeta Rani, senior advocate Sonia Mathur told SC that, significantly, district courts in Delhi, Punjab and Haryana, too, do not have any such mechanism. The bench sought status reports from registrar generals of the defaulting HCs, and bar associations and bar councils all over the country.The petitioner told the bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that the absence of a gender-sensitised complaint-handling structure in many courts, bar associations and tribunals results in serious constitutional violations and discourages women from fully participating in the justice delivery process.“In several courts across the country, there is either no established internal redressal mechanism, or the mechanism is not duly notified, accessible or functional. Information about complaint procedures, responsible authorities, or grievance redressal channels is often unavailable or opaque,” she said. “Sensitisation and awareness among court administration, judicial staff, security personnel and lawyers also remain inadequate.This systemic deficiency exposes women to an unsafe environment and undermines their constitutional guarantees,” the petitioner said.In the Vishaka judgment in 1997, Supreme Court had laid down mandatory guidelines requiring all institutions, including courts, to establish mechanisms for prevention and redressal of sexual harassment at workplace, recognising women’s right to equality, dignity and a safe work environment under Article 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution. In 2013, SC, in the Medha Kotwal Lele case, had reaffirmed and strengthened the Vishaka guidelines, and directed all institutions to ensure effective, independent and accessible complaint mechanisms to safeguard women’s rights at workplaces. In 2015, SC had constituted the Gender Sensitisation and Internal Complaints Committee for protection of female lawyers, employees, interns and litigants within court premises.The petitioner said, “The absence of similar mechanisms in HCs, district courts and tribunals results in unequal treatment of women lawyers across judicial Institutions and hence, violates Article 14. A constitutional standard available within SC must be replicated for every court of justice in the country.”","‘lack of redressal mechanism undermines women’s rights’ says pil petitioner geeta rani.

Bank Holidays January 2026: The new year 2026 has just begun and if your to-do list contains a bank visit, it’s a good idea to check when banks will be closed in January. A missed holiday can easily turn a routine bank visit into a wasted trip, especially in the first few days of the year when people are settling back into work and finances.Banks in India observe a mix of national and regional holidays, which means closure dates can differ from one state to another.Banks will remained closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Nagaland and Meghalaya on the occasion of New Year's Day and Gaan-Ngai.Banks will remain closed in Mizoram, Tamil Nadu in observance of New Year Celebrations and Mannam Jayanthi.Banks will remain closed in Uttar Pradesh for birthday of Hazrat Ali.Banks in West Bengal will remain closed in observance of birth day of Swami Vivekananda.Banks in Gujarat, Odisha, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh will be shut in on the occasion of Makar Sankranti and Magh Bihu.The states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh will remain closed for Uttarayana Punyakala, Pongal, Maghe Sankranti and Makara Sankranti.Banks in Tamil Nadu will be shut in observance of Thiruvalluvar Day.Banks in Tamil Nadu will remain closed due to Uzhavar Thirunal.Banks in Tripura, Odisha, West Bengal, will remain shut in observance of the birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed nationwide on the occasion of Republic day.Apart from these holidays, banks also remain closed on every second and fourth Saturday of the month.Knowing bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute delays. However, bank closure does not means that customers can not process their financial transactions during holidays. Even when branches are shut, online banking services, ATMs, mobile banking apps and UPI for fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions are available for customers.However, services that require a physical visit, such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances and issuing demand drafts, will not be available. To avoid inconvenience, account holders are advised to plan these activities in advance and make the most of digital banking options during closures.","Banks will remained closed in mizoram, tamil nadu, sikkim, manipur, arunachal pradesh, west bengal, nagaland and meghalaya on the occasion of new year's day and gaan-ngai.

What is at stake

Thackeray brothers unite

Natural allies

Both Sena (UBT) and MNS are “natural allies”. They derive their political legacy from the Shiv Sena, founded by the late Bal Thackeray, which was rooted in Marathi identity. Since then, the emotive issue of Marathi pride has remained central to both parties.

Since launching the MNS in 2006, Raj Thackeray has leaned heavily on an anti-North India stance as his political trademark. Uddhav, meanwhile, has championed the “Marathi manoos” narrative to advance his agenda.

Both parties performed poorly in the Assembly elections held in 2024. Ahead of the local body elections, the issue of Marathi identity—through opposition to the imposition of Hindi—has given both parties renewed energy to ignite Marathi pride among voters.

‘Pawar’ alliance

NCP (SP) to join NDA?

Will MVA disintegrate?

Who won the last local body elections?

Who dominated municipal council polls?

NEW DELHI: The stage is set for the first electoral showdown of 2026 as elections for 29 local bodies in Maharashtra are scheduled for January 15. These elections were long overdue because of legal battles.According to the Maharashtra Election Commission, polls for these corporations were held on different dates between 2015 and 2018. Elections for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which governs Mumbai, and 17 other major cities were last held in 2017. Five municipal corporations, including Vasai-Virar, Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Navi Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivli, went to the polls in 2015, while four others — Dhule, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar and Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad — had elected their mayors in 2018.Interestingly, many tectonic shifts were witnessed in the run-up to the elections. While the Thackeray and Pawar families ironed out alliances, many corporators from various parties jumped ship just ahead of the polls.The BMC has a budget of more than Rs 74,000 crore -- larger than the GDP of many states in the country and several countries across the world.Geographically, Mumbai, along with its suburbs, Pune and Nashik do not even constitute one-fourth of Maharashtra’s total area.However, this region is significant because of its wealth and the industries it hosts. Therefore, the corporations in these areas are highly important for political parties.It is thus inevitable that these elections become testing grounds for parties and alliances. The Mahayuti and the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) are the main contenders, but regional and smaller parties are also in the fray and determined to make their presence felt at the local level of urban governance.The BJP and Shiv Sena , constituents of the Mahayuti, are contesting 137 and 90 seats, respectively. The third Mahayuti ally, the NCP , is fighting independently and has fielded 94 candidates, meaning the party will take on its state-level partners in nearly 100 seats if no nominations are withdrawn.The opposition Congress has put up 143 candidates, while its new ally, the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), led by former MP Prakash Ambedkar, has fielded 42 contestants even though it was allotted 62 seats in a pre-poll pact with the national party.The Rashtriya Samaj Paksh (RSP), a Congress ally, has fielded six candidates.The Shiv Sena (UBT), led by former chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, is contesting over 150 seats, the NCP (SP) 11, and Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) the rest.In the upcoming elections, the Thackeray brothers - Uddhav and Raj Thackeray - have decided to join hands after 20 years and are contesting the elections on the plank of “Maratha pride”.“We will make sure that Marathi people get what they want,” Raj Thackeray said while announcing the alliance between Shiv Sena (UBT) and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena.Meanwhile, the Ajit Pawar-led NCP also announced that it will contest the Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune local body elections together with the NCP (Sharad Pawar faction).“For the sake of the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation elections, the ‘clock’ and the ‘tutari’ (trumpet) have united. The parivar has come together,” deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said while announcing the alliance.The announcement, however, came with a rider -- the decision has been taken only for Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, and family patriarch Sharad Pawar was not involved in the decision-making process.This comes two years after Ajit Pawar, along with a group of senior leaders, split from his uncle Sharad Pawar and joined hands with the BJP and Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. He had raised objections to Sharad Pawar continuing to lead the party despite his age.Ajit Pawar was sworn in as deputy chief minister under the new alliance. He favoured aligning with the ruling coalition, while Sharad Pawar’s faction insisted on remaining with the opposition.The Election Commission later recognised Ajit Pawar’s faction as the legitimate NCP, retaining the ‘clock’ symbol. Sharad Pawar’s faction, NCP (SP), adopted the ‘tutari’ (curved trumpet) symbol.Both factions contested elections separately. After the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, where his faction faced setbacks, Ajit Pawar acknowledged that turning his back on family had been a “mistake”.In the 2024 Maharashtra assembly elections, Ajit Pawar’s NCP increased its tally from just six Assembly segment leads in the Lok Sabha elections to 41 MLAs, defeating the senior Pawar’s nominees in 27 head-to-head contests; the latter won seven.During the campaign, Shiv Sena minister Sanjay Shirsat floated speculation over the possibility of the NCP (SP) joining the BJP-led NDA government.He said that local-level adjustments could be a precursor to a broader political understanding.“In the coming future, there is a possibility that Sharad Pawar could join the NDA. Did anyone believe that he would join hands with Uddhav Thackeray? But he did, and they were in power for two-and-a-half years,” Shirsat said.“He opposed Sonia Gandhi and left the Congress, and then immediately made an alliance with them. It would not be surprising if he joins the NDA. If you study politics, this has been his career pattern,” he added.The coming together of the Thackeray brothers and the senior and junior Pawars signals a silent end of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) -- the opposition front that Uddhav Thackeray formed with the Congress and Sharad Pawar’s NCP in 2019 to keep the BJP out of power after the assembly elections.The opposition coalition performed strongly in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, winning 30 of the 48 seats in the state. The glory, however, was short-lived as the MVA was decimated in the Assembly elections held later in the year, collectively winning only 46 of the 288 seats.In the run-up to the local body polls, the Congress has been left out of alliances after it refused to join hands with Raj Thackeray’s MNS, given his aggressive “outsiders” pitch against north Indians.The grand old party, which had earlier asserted it would contest the January 15 polls solo on all 227 wards, has now joined hands with Prakash Ambedkar-led VBA, allocating it 62 seats.Apart from the VBA, the Congress has allocated 10 seats to the RSP and two to the Republican Party of India (Gavai faction), unsettling functionaries of the party’s city unit, leaders said.The Congress move to chart its own course in Maharashtra is a bold gambit. The party, which had a fairly strong presence in state politics till 2009, has since seen its electoral fortunes decline.In the 2024 assembly elections, the Congress won only 16 of the 101 seats it contested. Its vote share stood at 12.42% — the lowest for the party in Maharashtra, though still higher than all other players except the BJP.However, this solo fight pits the Congress directly against the BJP, which has been the undisputed winner in recent electoral contests. The move also divides the opposition space in the civic polls, giving the BJP-led Mahayuti an advantage.The last elections in the municipal corporations were largely dominated by the BJP and the Shiv Sena, which formed governments in 15 municipal corporations, including Mumbai and Thane.The BJP secured a majority in 13 corporations on its own, including Pune, Jalgaon, Mira-Bhayandar, Nagpur and Pimpri-Chinchwad. The Shiv Sena achieved a majority in its stronghold, Thane. In Mumbai, they ruled as partners until the tenure ended in 2022.The BJP-led Mahayuti delivered a sweeping verdict after two rounds of the first phase of Maharashtra’s civic elections, winning presidents’ posts in nearly 207 of 288 municipal councils and nagar panchayats.The BJP emerged as the biggest gainer with victories in over 117 local bodies, while the MVA was reduced to 44 posts.Despite emerging as a distant challenger statewide, the Congress checked the BJP's advances in parts of Vidarbha. Western Maharashtra saw Mahayuti allies battling each other as the Congress and NCP (SP) struggled to hold ground.Meanwhile, the BJP made gains in Mumbai and Konkan, encroaching into traditional Shiv Sena, PWP and NCP pockets. The Shinde-led Sena expanded its footprint beyond the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), finishing second across the state.","The stage is set for the first electoral showdown of 2026 as elections for 29 local bodies in maharashtra are scheduled for january 15.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday backed the use of electric vehicles as Delhi continues to battle air pollution. The apex court said that car ownership has turned into a status symbol and urging greater responsibility from rricher sections of society.Hearing a plea related to air pollution, CJI Surya Kant remarked that personal transport choices were contributing significantly to the crisis.“Car has become a status symbol… People are saving money to buy cars and have stopped using cycles,” the CJI said, as reported by PTI.The CJI said, “The rich people should also sacrifice. Instead of going for high-end vehicles, they should go for good electric vehicles.”Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing in the matter, argued that curbing the ownership of multiple vehicles could be one way forward, while also pointing out that the automobile industry wielded considerable influence.The court also came down heavily on the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), describing it as “failing in its duty” after it sought a two-month adjournment on the issue of temporarily closing or relocating toll plazas at Delhi borders to ease congestion. The bench criticised the authority for a lack of urgency and seriousness in dealing with the pollution emergency.“Have you been able to identify the causes of pollution? … By holding a meeting on January 2 and telling us that we will come after two months, that is not acceptable to us.

‘Vote Theft In Bengal’: TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee Slams ECI Over SIR, BJP Fires Back

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that it has both the power and constitutional competence to carry out a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, arguing that it is duty-bound to ensure that no foreigners are included in voter lists.The submissions were made by senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for the EC, before a bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi.The bench resumed final hearings in a batch of petitions challenging the EC’s decision to undertake the SIR exercise in several states, including Bihar. The petitions raise constitutional questions on the scope of the poll panel’s powers, citizenship, and the right to vote.Dwivedi argued that the Constitution makes citizenship a foundational requirement for holding public office. Citing provisions such as Article 124(3), which governs the appointment of Supreme Court and high court judges, he said all key constitutional functionaries across the three organs of the State must be Indian citizens.He added that citizenship is also a prerequisite for holding offices such as president, vice president and prime minister.“All vital appointments ... no appointments can be made unless the person is a citizen, so our Constitution is citizen-centric predominantly,” Dwivedi said, according to news agency PTI.Referring to the constitutional scheme, he said, “The (constitutional) article, when it says citizens, that is something which has to be inquired by the competent authority. What should be the nature, summary etc., that is a different question.... There is a constitutional duty to ensure that on the electoral roll, there should not be any foreigners.”Dwivedi told the court that the Election Commission cannot be expected to respond to political rhetoric.“I am not commenting on the political parties, as the Election Commission, our duty is that no foreigner should be there.... It is to be seen that the power is there and the competence is there,” he said.Resuming his arguments, Dwivedi framed what he described as the central constitutional issue: whether Article 324, which grants the EC powers of superintendence, direction and control over elections, is completely displaced by statutory provisions or whether its application must be examined on a case-by-case basis.He submitted that Articles 324, 325 and 326 of the Constitution, read together with Section 16 of the Representation of the People Act, do not bar the EC from exercising its authority in revising electoral rolls.“The field is not totally foreclosed,” he said, asserting that the Commission retains constitutional competence to ensure the purity of voter lists.Tracing the evolution of voting rights, Dwivedi took the bench through colonial-era electoral practices, beginning with the introduction of separate communal electorates in 1909 and the limited franchise under the Government of India Acts, when only about 15 per cent of the population had voting rights. He argued that the expansion of the franchise was a central goal of India’s freedom struggle.“Not only Article 326, but the entire Constitution, when it speaks of a democratic republic, reflects an intention to create a citizen-centric polity,” he said.Addressing concerns that the SIR exercise could resemble a parallel citizenship determination similar to the National Register of Citizens (NRC), Dwivedi stressed that the two serve fundamentally different purposes.“The NRC includes all persons, whereas the electoral roll includes only citizens above the age of 18,” he said, adding that persons of unsound mind or otherwise disqualified are also excluded from voter lists.“On the face of it, the electoral roll is not like the NRC,” he said, reiterating that Article 326 permits only citizens to vote and that citizenship must be determined by a competent authority.Even if “10 or thousands” of foreigners are found on the electoral rolls, they must be removed, Dwivedi said, clarifying that the EC is not making political judgments but fulfilling its constitutional obligation.The senior advocate is scheduled to resume his arguments on Thursday, January 8.Earlier, the bench had questioned whether the EC is barred from conducting inquiries in cases of doubtful citizenship and whether such an inquisitorial process falls outside its constitutional mandate.","The supreme court resumes final hearings in a batch of petitions challenging the ec’s decision to undertake the sir exercise in several states, including bihar.

NEW DELHI: The road transport and highways has given its “in-principle” approval for the Atal Progress-way, also known as the Chambal Expressway. The project will connect the Delhi–Mumbai Expressway with the Bundelkhand Expressway and will pass through parts of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh.The 420-km expressway, a mix of expansion of existing highway stretches and construction of a greenfield section, would cost around Rs 14,000 crore. Road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari confirmed this to TOI on Tuesday. The decision was taken at a review meeting chaired by Gadkari on Monday evening and was attended by MP CM Mohan Yadav and two Union ministers — Bhupender Yadav and Jyotiraditya Scindia.National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will build the 6-lane access-controlled corridor. Officials said the alignment of the project was reworked after the earlier plan faced some issues. “The new alignment falls outside forest and wildlife areas, and also outside the Chambal ravines (beehad). After major modification in the alignment, the environment clearances have been obtained. The project will benefit aspirational (backward) regions in all the three states,” said an official.The access-controlled corridor will connect Kota in Rajasthan with Etawah in UP and cities in MP, including Morena and Bhind. This will reduce both travel time from 10-11 hours at present, to only 5-6 hoursOfficials said the corridor will also provide connectivity to Agra-Jhansi, Kota-Jhansi-Kanpur and Agra-Kanpur highways.

NEW DELHI: Observing that a fearless judge is the bedrock of an independent judiciary, Supreme Court on Monday held that disciplinary proceedings can’t be initiated against a judge for an error of judgment on their part. It also expressed concern over frivolous complaints being filed against members of judiciary, which lead to trial court judges treading with trepidation with regard to bail matters.Coming to the rescue of a trial judge whose services were terminated by Madhya Pradesh high court for an error of judgment in grant of bail to an accused, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan said it is not the correctness of the verdict but the conduct of the judicial officer in question which is determinative. While HC must immediately intervene when an allegation against a judge is true “to weed out black sheep sullying the fair name of the judiciary”, it must also defend a judge facing false and anonymous complaints, the court said. “A fearless judge is the bedrock of an independent judiciary, as much as an independent judiciary itself is the foundation on which rule of law rests.”A judicial officer is tasked with the onerous duty of deciding cases.Invariably, one party to the case would lose and go back unhappy. Disgruntled elements amongst them, wanting to settle scores, may raise frivolous allegations. The trial judiciary also has tremendous work pressure and works under trying working conditions. Large number of cases are listed in a day and most of the judicial officers give their very best while discharging their duties,” Justice Viswanathan, who penned the judgment, said.The functioning of trial judiciary would be seriously impacted and fearless discharge of duties would become a casualty if inquiries are launched on ill-conceived or motivated complaints, the court said, pointing out that a wrong decision can be a bona fide error of judgment.“It should be ensured that only because an order is wrong or there is an error of judgment, without anything more, a judicial officer is not put through the ordeal of a disciplinary proceeding or a prosecution... When false allegations fly thick and fast, the judicial officers cannot react. Here is where the high court, which is vested with the supervisory control, has to exercise great caution and circumspection,” the bench said while quashing the HC order and directing that the judicial officer be reinstated with back wages.The court said there was no merit in the allegation against the judge and the integrity of a judge cannot be questioned merely because of an erroneous order. “It will be a dangerous proposition to hold that judgments and orders which do not refer expressly to statutory provisions are per se dishonest judgments.”Justice Pardiwala said that initiation of departmental proceedings on mere suspicion is one of the primary reasons trial court judges are reluctant to exercise their discretion for grant of bail, resulting in HCs and SC being flooded with bail pleas. “It should not happen that because of the lurking fear in the mind of a trial court judge, of some administrative action being taken, that even in a deserving case, well within the principles of law, bail is declined. .. Over a period of time, the trial court judges have exhibited tendency to shirk from their solemn judicial function and responsibility when it comes to exercising discretion in matters relating to bail,” he said.",Probes based on motivated complaints will hit functioning of trial judiciary: sc.

NEW DELHI: Over 9,000 birds across 131 species were spotted along Yamuna floodplains in the capital during the Asian Waterbird Census this weekend.The survey, carried out by a group of nearly 20 birders in collaboration with eBird, an online avian database, flagged several ecological threats to the habitat, including illegal sand mining on the floodplains, predation by stray dogs, dumping of construction and demolition debris as well as plastic waste along the river.Four teams of birders surveyed a 22-km stretch from Wazirabad Barrage to Okhla Barrage. Black-headed gulls (2,500) dominated the count, followed by 1,700 barn swallows. Pied avocet (136), ruddy shelduck (112), white wagtail (108) and house sparrow (90) were also spotted.The birders highlighted habitat degradation of these birds because of removal of aquatic reeds, cultivation on the riverbed and open burning of waste along the bank. They also flagged declining water quality of the river because of sewage and agrochemical runoff.Pankaj Gupta, Delhi-NCR project coordinator of Asian Waterbird Census eBird, said, ""If the condition of Yamuna floodplains is not improved, there is likely to be a decline in the number of waterbirds in future.""Akash Gulalia, director of Amaltas Nature Walks, said that the river ecosystem faces a massive threat due to increasing agricultural land on the riverbed and rampant use of chemical fertiliser in them.""Cutting and clearing of aquatic and riparian vegetation has left little space for these birds to breed. Illegal mining is another major issue,"" said Gulalia.Apart from Yamuna floodplains, the birders will carry out surveys in smaller wetlands in north Delhi, including Rohini, later this month. Sultanpur, Chandu, Jhanjrola, Bhindawas, Dhigal, Mandothi, Okhla Bird Sanctuary, Surajpur, Dhanuari and Dadri wetlands will also be covered.The census is coordinated by Wetlands International, a global organisation that works to sustain and restore wetlands and their resources, and is carried out in several countries every January.","Four teams survey 22km stretch on river floodplain, spot 131 species.
