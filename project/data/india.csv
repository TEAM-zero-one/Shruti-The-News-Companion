NEW DELHI: Touching a raw nerve among the deprived communities and champions of social justice, a key parliamentary panel said the ""Not Found Suitable (NFS)"" tag should not be used to deny SC and ST teachers opportunities in appointments and promotions, acknowledging the prevalence of the controversial practice while urging ""better judgment"" in recruitment of faculty members in universities.The Parliamentary Committee on SC/ST Welfare, while making the observation in context of a review of appointments in Delhi University, weighed in on a subject that has become a matter of wider concern. ""While interacting with SC/ST teachers welfare association of DU, a glaring issue that came to fore was declaration of SC/ST teachers as 'NFS' for posts earmarked for them,"" it noted in a report tabled in the Parliament in its ongoing monsoon session.""The committee vehemently condemns the usage of the term 'NFS' to deny eligible SC/ST teachers opportunities in appointments and promotions. The committee opines that declaring SC/ST candidates 'NFS' is not only inappropriate and hurts the sentiments of deserving, eligible and well qualified SC/ST candidates,"" the panel, headed by BJP MP Faggan Singh Kulaste, noted.The NFS debate revolves around allegations that authorities in educational institutions are manipulating fair employment opportunities for Dalits and tribals by dismissing candidatures as lacking suitability for faculty positions.Claiming large-scale vacancies against SC/ST quota in central universities, leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi recently blamed the governing BJP dispensation for 'NFS', which, he said, was being used to deny the marginalised communities leadership roles in education.""NFS is the new Manuvaad now.

NEW DELHI: Stating that EC has uploaded the list of 65 lakh voters deleted from Bihar's draft electoral roll within 56 hours of SC's directive, CEC Gyanesh Kumar on Sunday exhorted electors and political parties in the state to file their claims and objections in the remaining 15-day timeframe, saying flagging any errors after Sept 1, shall be pointless.Justifying its decision to undertake SIR exercise in Bihar, EC said all the political parties had, for the past two decades, been demanding that imperfections in electoral roll be corrected. ""Acting on this demand, EC decided to take up SIR, starting with Bihar,"" he told a press conference here, while adding that the timeline for SIR in other poll-bound states will be announced ""at the appropriate time"".Slamming the ""vote theft"" allegations levelled by opposition parties and their chiefs, EC said the electors, party representatives and booth level officers on the ground are working in a harmonious and transparent manner, endorsing the exercise with their signatures and video testimonials. ""It is a matter of concern that endorsements of district presidents and booth level agents of parties are either not reaching their state level and national leadership, or the latter have chosen to overlook these, and are trying to spread misinformation,"" said Kumar.Clearing the air on timing of SIR, the CEC said that since the annual summary revision was with respect to Jan 1, 2025, April 1 was too early to start the next revision, while Oct 1 would have been too close to the assembly poll due in Bihar in Nov.As regards allegations of hundreds and thousands of voters being registered on the same address, Kumar said in the absence of proper numbering of houses/addresses by the panchayats/municipalities and also the presence of unauthorised settlements, it has been an accepted norm for EC/BLO to register voters from notional addresses, often carrying 'zero' house number. Electoral roll excerpts shared by EC with TOI, of Assam in 1966, Rajasthan in 1980, UP in 1985, show their house number as either missing or as '01'.","Chief election commissioner (cec) gyanesh kumar addresses a press conference on bihar special intensive revision (sir), at the national media centre in new delhi on sunday.

"'Why me, not Anurag Thakur?’: Rahul questions CEC’s affidavit warning; reiterates SIR 'stealing votes' in Bihar claim",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-me-not-anurag-thakur-rahul-questions-cecs-affidavit-warning-reiterates-sir-stealing-votes-in-bihar-claim/articleshow/123347083.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday hit out at the Election Commission over its affidavit warning, doubling down on his allegation that the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of voter rolls in Bihar is nothing but ""stealing votes.""Launching a 1,300-km ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ from Bihra'sSasaram along with RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, Rahul in Aurangabad said, ""SIR means stealing votes from the people of Bihar. Earlier, they used to do it secretly. Now they are doing it openly in front of everyone.""""The Election Commission asks for an affidavit from me. But when Anurag Thakur says the same thing that I am saying, it does not ask for an affidavit from him,"" the leader of opposition added.His attack came shortly after Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar in a press conference, rejected the Opposition’s allegations and insisted that the voter roll process was fully transparent.CEC Kumar issuing a stern warning said that Rahul Gandhi must either submit an affidavit supporting his claims or apologise within seven days.""If no declaration under oath given within 7 days, claims will be considered baseless and invalid…,"" he said, adding that those making unfounded allegations should apologise to the nation.The CEC rejected the Opposition’s allegations, stressing that the voter roll process is transparent. ""You all know that as per the law, the birth of every political party takes place only through registration with the Election Commission. So how can the EC discriminate among those very parties? For the EC, there is no ruling side or opposition side; all are equal,"" the CEC added.Rahul further responded to CEC Kumar's clarification saying that the EC cannot release CCTV footage of voters due to privacy concerns, and stressed that the Commission treats all political parties equally.""I want to ask them, you made a law for CCTV. Then why did you change that law? Why did the government change it? Do you know that no case can be filed against the Election Commissioner? Do you know when this law was made? This law was made in 2023. Why was this law made in 2023?"" the leader of opposition asserted.""Because Narendra Modi and Amit Shah want that no action can be taken against the Election Commission. Because the Election Commission is helping them and is stealing votes with them,"" he added, alleging that the PM Modi led-government deliberately changed CCTV-related laws in 2023 .Kumar had earlier said that the EC cannot share CCTV footage of voters as it violates privacy, and reminded that all political parties are equal before the Commission.""We saw a few days ago that photos of many voters were presented to the media without their permission. Allegations were made against them, they were used. Should the Election Commission share the CCTV videos of any voter including their mothers, daughters-in-law, daughters? Only those whose names are in the voter list cast their votes to elect their candidate,"" CEC Kumar had said.Rahul also mocked the voter deletions, recalling a viral video he shared last week of having tea with people who had been marked “dead” in the revised draft list.""We, INDIA alliance leaders, have made up our mind that we will not allow vote theft in Bihar...Did you see my video where I am drinking tea with dead people? The Election Commission killed people who are alive. Their name was deleted. I asked them why their name was deleted?” he said.The Voter Adhikar Yatra, supported by the INDIA bloc partners including the RJD, CPI(ML), and VIP, will run for 16 days across 20 districts and conclude with a rally in Patna on September 1.Supporters carrying party flags raised slogans of “vote chor, gaddi chhor” against the BJP and the EC during the launch.With the Bihar Assembly polls just three months away, the yatra is being seen as a united show of strength by the Opposition in the state.","Rahul gandhi launches a 1,300-km ‘voter adhikar yatra’ from bihra'ssasaram along with rjd leader tejashwi yadav.

Delhi Rain Chaos: Waterlogged Streets, Massive Traffic Jams Hit City After Sudden Change in Weather

YAMUNANAGAR: The Yamuna River, which had remained calm for nearly six weeks, surged into spate on Saturday following heavy rainfall in the hilly regions of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. As a precaution, all 18 gates of the Hathnikund Barrage in Yamunanagar district were opened for the first time this monsoon season, releasing a massive discharge of 1,78,896 cusecs of water downstream.The released water is expected to reach national capital Delhi within the next 30-48 hours, raising the river’s water level and posing a potential flood risk to low-lying areas.Officials of the Haryana irrigation and water resources department (IWRD) sounded alert sirens before opening the barrage gates and issued warnings to residents and farmers to stay away from the riverbanks and keep their livestock at a safe distance. The district administration, as well as the Delhi government, has been informed of the situation.Haryana IWRD superintendent engineer at Yamunanagar, R S Mittal stated that due to heavy rainfall in the hilly catchment areas, water levels rose sharply, necessitating the release. “This is the first time this season that all 18 gates of the Hathnikund Barrage have been opened. Supply to canals has been stopped to manage the increased flow,” Mittal said.As per official categorisation, a discharge of over one lakh cusecs is considered low flood, 1.5 lakh cusecs is termed medium flood, and anything above 2.5 lakh cusecs is classified as high flood. With the current release already exceeding the low flood mark, officials are keeping a close watch on the situation.Water levels in the Yamuna rose steadily since morning on Sunday. At 10 am, the flow was recorded at 74,304 cusecs, which rose to 81,353 cusecs at 11 am; 91,985 cusecs at noon, and 1.16 lakh cusecs by 1 pm. By 3 pm, the discharge peaked at 1.78 lakh cusecs, said the state IWRD officer.Meanwhile, several other rivers and streams in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh are also in spate. The Somb River, a tributary to Yamuna River, which has a capacity of 10,000 cusecs, is currently carrying over 23,000 cusecs of water, threatening villages in its catchment areas. In Dhanaura village and nearby Haripur Khol, local streams have also overflowed, raising fears of inundation. At Ranjitpur, the bridge connecting Haryana to Himachal Pradesh was under pressure as river water flowed over it, causing concern among residents.With monsoon rains continuing in the hills, authorities are on high alert. Residents in vulnerable areas along the Yamuna have been cautioned about possible flooding as Delhi braces for a rise in river levels over the next two days.","All 18 gates of the hathnikund barrage in yamunanagar district were opened for the first time this monsoon season.

She then completed a Master’s degree and recently cleared the Solicitors Qualifying Examination (SQE), formally entering the record books.Speaking about her journey, Krishangi said, “Studying with flexibility not only gave me academic freedom but also taught me discipline, focus, and organisation. These skills helped me secure a role at an international law firm, where I am now gaining practical experience.”She added that distance learning allowed her to balance studies with family commitments and travel. “I adopted strict routines, removed distractions, and approached my work with professional discipline from the start,” she said.Her parents Tapan and Indira Meshram expressed pride at the news of their daughter becoming one of the youngest solicitors in England, Wales but said that they did not see it coming. “We are very proud of Krishangi’s achievement. When she started on this journey, we encouraged her to give it her best shot, but we couldn’t have anticipated such a remarkable outcome,” they said.Krishangi’s interest in law began early. “After completing a short course on law from Harvard University, she developed an affinity for legal practice because it resonated deeply with her core values of justice and fairness. Discovering that law touches the lives of all in diverse ways, she was inspired to begin her journey as soon as possible,” her father told TOI.Her upbringing in Iskcon Mayapur played a pivotal role. “Growing up in a serene and nurturing environment, away from toxic academic competition, Krishangi developed self-discipline, focus, and introspection from an early age,” he said.","Krishangi meshram is the youngest solicitor in england and wales in recent times.
