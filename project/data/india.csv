Ahmedabad London Flight Crash: 3 photos that tell the full horror of Ahmedabad-London Air India flight AI-171’s final moments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/in-34-seconds-3-photos-that-tell-the-full-horror-of-ahmedabad-london-air-india-flight-ai-171s-final-moments/articleshow/121817176.cms,"A London-bound Air India Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, killing at least 245 people, including former Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani. The Boeing 787-8, carrying 242 passengers and crew, failed to gain altitude, impacting near the airport.

Flight AI-171 seen moments after lifting off from Ahmedabad airport, flying unusually low with its landing gear still deployed — the aircraft appears to struggle for altitude just 425 feet above the ground before vanishing behind buildings near Meghaninagar.

Vijay Rupani’s Chilling Last Visuals from Doomed Air India Flight AI171 | WATCH

A massive explosion engulfs the BJ Medical College hostel building as the Dreamliner crashes into the doctors’ mess, triggering a fireball and dense black smoke that rose above the Meghaninagar skyline. Eyewitnesses described the sound as “like a bomb going off”.

The mangled remains of Air India’s 787-8 Dreamliner sprawled across the residential block and mess hall — its tail section wedged into the rooftop and debris scattered across half a kilometre. The scale of destruction left little hope for survivors.

NEW DELHI: In just 34 seconds, a routine takeoff turned into India’s deadliest single-aircraft crash. And in those same 34 seconds, three images, now etched into the nation’s memory, captured the full descent into horror.The first photo shows Air India’s London-bound Dreamliner moments after it lifts off from Runway 23 of Ahmedabad airport at 1.39pm. The aircraft, an 11-year-old Boeing 787-8, appears unusually low, barely clearing the airport perimeter. Its landing gear is still down. It isn’t climbing — it’s gliding flat, almost hesitantly, as if fighting an invisible drag. Flaps aren’t visibly engaged. For a wide-body aircraft carrying over 240 people, the trajectory looks disturbingly unnatural.The second frame freezes the exact moment of impact. The aircraft, having lost altitude rapidly, tears into the BJ Medical College hostel mess in Meghaninagar. The image captures a deafening blast — an orange-white fireball erupting from the ground, hurling metal, glass, and flame into the sky. Black smoke begins to rise instantly. Eyewitnesses said they heard the plane coming in too low.The third photo is aftermath.Nothing resembling an aircraft remains. The fuselage has splintered; debris strewn across the hostel quarters and adjacent lanes. A section of the empennage — the aircraft’s tail — hangs grotesquely from the roof of the mess building. The landing gear is embedded in a nearby wall. The crash site, just 3km from the end of the runway, looks like a war zone.AI-171, with 242 passengers and crew onboard, had taken off late — and didn’t get far. Captain Sumeet Sabharwal’s calm “Mayday” call to Ahmedabad ATC was the last transmission. After climbing to just 425 feet, the plane nosedived, leaving little time for response, and no chance for recovery.The crash killed at least 245 people, including former Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani and several doctors and residents on the college campus. One man, seated in 11A — a UK national of Indian origin — survived and walked out of the burning fuselage. The death toll is expected to rise, with nearly 290 body bags in use by rescue teams.Initial probes point to a double engine failure, possibly due to bird strike — though investigators have not ruled out technical or procedural lapses. This was the first crash involving a Boeing 787 Dreamliner since its launch. The aircraft had logged over 41,000 flight hours, with 8,000 takeoffs and landings in the past year alone.The Tata Group has announced ₹1 crore compensation for each victim’s family and has pledged support to rebuild the BJ Medical College hostel.As firefighters, NDRF teams, and hospital staff sifted through the charred remains, the three photos — frozen moments from a tragedy — told the full story in a way words never could.","London-bound air india dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff from ahmedabad, killing at least 245 people, including former gujarat cm vijay rupani.

Meghalaya Murder: ‘Kamakhya visit before consummation of marriage’: Cops say Sonam used temple ruse to lure husband Raja Raghuvanshi to northeast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/kamakhya-visit-before-consummation-of-marriage-cops-say-sonam-used-temple-ruse-to-lure-husband-raja-raghuvanshi-to-northeast/articleshow/121793341.cms,"Raja Raghuvanshi from Indore was killed during his honeymoon in Meghalaya. His wife, Sonam, allegedly planned the murder with her boyfriend, Raj Kushwaha. They hired three contract killers.

Poll Should there be stricter laws for preventing domestic violence and murder? Yes, definitely. No, current laws are sufficient.

NEW DELHI: Raja Raghuvanshi, the Indore-based businessman murdered during his honeymoon in Meghalaya, had been convinced by his wife Sonam to delay consummating the marriage until after a ritual offering at the Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati — a ruse investigators now say was part of a sinister plot to lure him to the Northeast and have him killed in a remote location.“Sonam told Raja that they should first visit the Kamakhya Devi Temple and offer prayers before consummating the marriage,” a senior investigating officer told PTI on Wednesday.The couple got married in Indore on May 11 and travelled to the Northeast on May 20, reaching Meghalaya via Guwahati. They checked out of a homestay in Nongriat village on May 23 and then disappeared — prompting Raja’s family to raise an alert. Ten days later, on June 2, Raja’s body was found in a gorge near Weisawdong Falls in Sohra.The case has since unravelled as a premeditated murder allegedly orchestrated by Sonam in connivance with her boyfriend Raj Kushwaha and three hired contract killers. Sonam, who initially went missing after the murder, resurfaced in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh, and surrendered on June 9. Her boyfriend and the three hitmen — Vishal Singh Chauhan, Akash Rajput, and Anand Kurmi — were arrested soon after.According to investigators, Sonam pushed for the trip to Nongriat — a remote jungle area accessible only by trekking — hoping the murder would be easier to execute there. But the plan was delayed due to heavy tourist presence on May 22 and 23.“They ultimately killed Raja near Weisawdong Falls and dumped his body into a gorge,” said the officer.East Khasi Hills SP Vivek Syiem, who is leading the investigation, said the contract killers arrived in Guwahati on May 21, a day after the couple reached the Northeast. They bought a machete near their hotel before heading to Shillong by road.“Sonam stayed in touch with Raj throughout the day of the murder, while Raj coordinated with the three killers. She was present at the spot when Raja was killed,” said SP Syiem.After the murder, Sonam fled from Mawkdok to Shillong in a local taxi, then hired a tourist cab to Guwahati, from where she boarded multiple trains to avoid detection.“While she claims to have returned to Indore directly, we are still verifying this route,” the officer added.The Meghalaya Police SIT is now piecing together the full timeline of events and has already gathered CCTV evidence and mobile data to support the investigation.“We are also verifying Sonam’s claim that she had never been to Meghalaya before. The SIT is committed to filing a watertight chargesheet,” an officer said.All five accused — Sonam, Raj Kushwaha, and the three contract killers — have been produced before a court in Shillong and remain in police custody.","Raja raghuvanshi from indore was killed during his honeymoon in meghalaya.

LUCKNOW: Accused of plotting to murder her husband during their honeymoon, Sonam is said to have agreed to marry fearing for her ailing father's life.This facet came to light during interrogation of Lalitpur native Akash Rajput, who said Sonam feared her father would die of heart attack if she did not marry as per his wish.According to Rajput's statement, Sonam's father Devi Singh suffers from a serious heart condition, and she was reportedly convinced that her refusal to marry Raja would trigger a fatal heart attack.Despite her personal reluctance and reported feelings for another man, Sonam got married just to fulfil her father's wish and, to safeguard his health thereby.Investigators believe that soon after Sonam married Raja, her lover Raj Kushwaha got agitated by the union and police allege this resentment was at the root of the plot to eliminate Raja just five days after the wedding.Police said Rajput revealed the murder plan was hatched and discussed in a café located next to Sonam's residence near Nandbagh colony in Indore.This proximity raises further questions about the extent of Sonam's knowledge, if any, regarding the plan, although current police statements point at her coerced marriage as primary motive for her actions leading to the murder.Police are now working on corroborating Akash Rajput's testimony and are interrogating Raj Kushwaha, believed to be the central figure in the murder case.",Sonam is said to have agreed to marry fearing for her ailing father's life.

GUWAHATI: The Assam government on Friday issued a shoot-at-sight order in the India-Bangladesh border town of Dhubri after dusk to rein in what CM Himanta Biswa Sarma described as ""a communal group"" fomenting trouble over the past week.The immediate trigger for the directive to enforcement agencies, including Rapid Action Force and CRPF reinforcements, was a purported poster campaign by the group for ""Dhubri's integration with Bangladesh"".The town has been on the edge for several days following mob violence over offal being found near a place of worship.CM, who was in Dhubri district to take stock, said police found at least three provocative posters put up by a group identified as Nabin Bangla at different locations there.""Since the last one week, maintaining law and order in Dhubri has been challenging.

The next day, offal was allegedly dumped at another location, leading to stone-pelting at night, Sarma said.CM said a large herd of cattle illegally brought to Dhubri from Bengal by a ""new beef mafia"" was another reason for the disturbances. ""I have ordered an inquiry into this. I have directed the authorities to arrest whoever has started this cattle trade.""Sarma declared that he would camp in Dhubri for two days on Eid next year to ensure something like this didn't recur.

Why Venice locals are protesting against Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez Wedding venue

Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding, set for June 24 in Venice, is facing a fierce backlash from local residents and activists. Demonstrators have unfurled banners across historic churches, including the San Giorgio Maggiore Church, with slogans like “No Space for Bezos”, signaling their frustration over the lavish event. The $10 million celebration, planned on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, has triggered protests over blocked streets, luxury hotel takeovers, and environmental concerns, threatening to disrupt the Floating City during its peak tourist season.One of the most striking acts of dissent saw a large banner unfurled from the bell tower of the historic San Giorgio Maggiore Church. The banner, featuring a bold red 'X' slashing through Bezos's name, sent a clear visual message across the lagoon, quickly garnering attention on social media platforms. Flyers with similar slogans, including ""No space for oligarchs, no space for Bezos,"" have also been plastered across the city.The protests stem from concerns that Bezos’ wedding, scheduled for June 24-26, is turning Venice into a “playground for the ultra-wealthy”, exacerbating issues of overtourism, restricted public access, and environmental strain. Activists claim that Bezos has reserved luxury hotels, water taxis, and even an entire island, limiting movement for locals during peak tourist season.Local activist group Laboratorio Occupato Morion , which describes itself as an ""anti-fascist, anti-capitalist, anti-racist, and trans-feminist political space,"" is leading the charge against the event. Alice Bazzoli, a spokesperson for the Laboratorio Occupato Morion, a local activist group, stated: ""Bezos thinks he can buy the entire city. We refuse to let Venice be held hostage by one of the richest men in the world.""Organisers emphasise that their actions are not a personal attack on Bezos and Sanchez, but rather a broader statement against the disruptive nature of such events in a city already grappling with immense pressure.The couple is likely to host their guests at Scuola Grande della Misericordia. Built in 1310, the historical building was originally one of Venice’s Seven Scuole Grandi, a site reserved for city’s elite. The venue consists of grand frescoes by Renaissance masters such as Tintoretto, Veronese, and Pellegrini, making it one of the most opulent locations in the city. The building, which has been repurposed for exhibitions and events, can accommodate up to 1,000 guests.The wedding, scheduled for the weekend of June 24, is expected to host Hollywood stars, business moguls, and political figures. Among the rumored guests are Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, and Eva Longoria.","Jeff bezos and lauren sanchez's wedding is facing a fierce backlash from local residents and activists.

But the temperature was so high, it made operations difficult. There were debris everywhere, already simmering, and we had to clear them,” he said.He claimed his team recovered 25–30 bodies, including those of children. “DNA tests will have to be done for recognition of bodies,” he added.Another SDRF official said he lost count of how many bodies he removed. “It was so quick that even animals and birds got little time to escape,” he said, pointing to carcasses in the residential complex.Besides passengers and crew members, students and others on the BJ Medical College premises were among those killed.

Poll Should police investigate the actions of spouses more thoroughly in suspicious cases? Yes, they should No, it could lead to wrongful accusations





NEW DELHI: A mangalsutra and a ring left behind in a suitcase proved to be the first vital clue that helped police crack the sensational murder of Indore businessman Raja Raghuvanshi, who was killed during his honeymoon in Meghalaya last month, Meghalaya DGP I Nongrang said on Wednesday.Raja (29) and his wife Sonam (25) had arrived in Meghalaya via Guwahati on May 20, just days after their May 11 wedding in Indore. On May 23, the couple vanished from Sohra (Cherrapunji) in East Khasi Hills after checking out of a homestay in Nongriat village.“We recovered Sonam's mangalsutra and a ring from the suitcase they left behind at a homestay in Sohra. A married woman leaving behind such symbols of marriage raised our suspicion and gave us a reason to pursue her as a suspect,” DGP Nongrang told PTI.Raja’s decomposed body was found in a gorge near Weisawdong Falls on June 2. Police launched a multi-state chase for Sonam, who eventually surfaced on June 9 — over 1,200km away — in Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur, where she surrendered before police.Police have also arrested Sonam’s alleged boyfriend Raj Kushwaha and three contract killers. All five have been remanded to eight days of police custody by a court in Shillong.According to a police officer involved in the probe, the couple had walked into the Sohra homestay on May 22 without any prior booking. Since they didn’t get a room and had plans to trek over 3,000 steps to Nongriat village to see the famed double-decker root bridge, they left their suitcase at the homestay and spent the night at another homestay in Nongriat.The next morning, they trekked back to Sohra, picked up their scooter and rode to Weisawdong Falls — the site where Raja was allegedly killed by three contract killers, reportedly in front of Sonam.Earlier, PTI had reported that a local tour guide had spotted the couple with three Hindi-speaking men on the trail back to Sohra, a detail that later turned out to be crucial in identifying the accused.“The accused have admitted to the crime. With all the evidence gathered, there is little room for denial,” a senior police officer said.","Police cracked the murder case of indore businessman raja raghuvanshi, killed during his honeymoon in meghalaya.
