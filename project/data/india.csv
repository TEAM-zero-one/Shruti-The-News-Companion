NEW DELHI: As part of his campaign to re-populate settlements hit by exodus of locals in Uttarakhand, Garhwal MP Anil Baluni played Holi with current and former residents of Dhoor village during his visit to the constituency.Several former residents returned to the village briefly to play the festival of colour to render the almost empty village a vibrant feel, which reminded them of a bygone era before they relocated to different cities in search of livelihood.""Since childhood, I have seen villages being deserted because people sought better lives in cities. Today, many of them are called ghost villages . But now, with improved roads, electricity, water and other facilities, it is time to return to our roots, where our heritage truly thrives,"" Baluni said.Baluni, who was a Rajya Sabha member before being elected to Lok Sabha in 2024, has been spearheading a campaign to revive traditional festivals, a call given by PM Narendra Modi, and to bring back former residents to their native villages to revive the old way of life in these remote, hilly areas which have suffered stagnation as people left.Once vibrant with laughter and livestock, these hamlets, numbering hundreds across Uttarakhand, lie abandoned now, their terraced fields covered with wild weeds and the houses locked and crumbling, he said.Migration has taken a toll on the region, he added.Baluni said Pauri had eight Assembly constituencies earlier but the number has come down to six and it can fall further after the next ""delineation"". Several districts across the hill state are facing the same crisis, he said.Amid the splash of colours and bursts of laughter, Holi was celebrated with the handful of families still staying put in Dhoor. They were joined by many former residents who returned from distant cities on the occasion.Baluni has been visiting such villages at frequent intervals in his efforts to repopulate them. As part of his efforts, the BJP leader has also launched the ""Apna Vote Apne Gaon"" campaign, urging people to register themselves as voters in their native villages.","Garhwal mp anil baluni is spearheading a campaign to re-populate settlements hit by exodus of locals in uttarakhand.

"For 61 lakh 'doubtful' voters, it's a race against time to get on electoral roll",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-61-lakh-doubtful-voters-its-a-race-against-time-to-get-on-electoral-roll/articleshow/128904060.cms,"Mamata Banerjee vs Election Commission: Supreme Court Orders Judicial Oversight in Bengal SIR

NEW DELHI: Around 60 lakh electors in West Bengal have been categorised as 'doubtful' by Election Commission, and their cases have been sent for adjudication by judicial officers appointed by the Kolkata high court. This is in line with the Supreme Court 's directive dated Feb 20. With assembly elections in the state likely to be announced in the second half of March, this means that it would be a race against time for the ""doubtful"" voters to be made a part of the electoral list.Sources said that the final electorate of Bengal is around 6.4 crore, with a total 1.2 crore deletions since Oct 27, 2025 (15.9%). Of these, around 61.8 lakh were deleted on account of being deceased, shifted, migrated and registered at multiple places and another 60 lakh categorised as 'doubtful' voters under adjudication.Such 'doubtful' electors, as and when their cases are approved by the court-appointed judicial officers, shall be added back to the state's roll by way of supplementary lists to be published later. Until then, these voters will not be eligible to vote in any election.A senior EC functionary told TOI that the majority of these 'doubtful' electors are likely to be illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. ""Despite stiff resistance, the SIR exercise in Bengal has been a huge success,"" said another EC official.According to the rules, the electoral roll of a state is frozen 10 days before the last date for nomination in Lok Sabha or assembly elections. So only those 'doubtful' voters whose cases are disposed of within the prescribed deadline can vote in the upcoming Bengal assembly elections.It remains to be seen how much time the judicial officers will take to dispose of cases of the 60 lakh 'doubtful' voters in West Bengal. The cases of thousands of 'doubtful' or 'D' voters in Assam, categorised as such since 1997 and not allowed to vote, have been under adjudication by the foreigners tribunals for decades. Only after the tribunals declare the 'D' voters as bona fide citizens can they vote. If ruled as foreigners, they are sent to detention centres and deportation proceedings initiated.The judiciary-appointed officers in Bengal will now have to do the same for those categorised as 'doubtful' voters due to SIR, ostensibly on grounds of being Bangladeshis. So effectively, the judicial officers will act like foreigners tribunals, examining and confirming citizenship of 'doubtful' electors before restoring their voting rights.At the start of the SIR exercise on Oct 27, 2025, Bengal's electorate stood at 7.7 crore. The draft roll published on Dec 16, 2025, put the strength of the electorate at 7.08 crore after 58.2 lakh deletions. The final roll published on Saturday listed 6.4 crore voters, with 3.6 lakh net deletions since draft roll publication.",60 lakh electors in west bengal have been categorised as 'doubtful' by election commission.

It posted the next hearing on the matter on Sep 1. It directed state committees to file quarterly reports on implementation of SC directed reforms in open prisons before the jurisdictional HCs, which in turn will file yearly reports before SC every March 31.Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Mehta said, ""Exclusion of women from OCIs, or failure to transfer them despite being eligible for transfer from closed prisons to OCIs, amounts to blatant gender discrimination, violative of Articles 14 and 15(1) of the Constitution, and also infringes upon their right to live with dignity as guaranteed under Article 21.""He said, ""Denial of access to OCIs deprives women prisoners of equal opportunity for rehabilitation and cannot be sustained in a constitutional order committed to equality, dignity and the transformative promise of justice. Immediate and effective corrective measures are, therefore, imperative in this regard.""The bench frowned at the long wait for a person lodged in closed jails - varying between 4 to 21 years in different states - to become eligible for shifting to an open jail.","Women inmates, like male prisoners, have a fundamental right to be lodged in open correctional institutions (ocis), supreme court rules.

Bengaluru Metro Fare Hike: Un-fare deal: Namma Metro fare hike sparks backlash as Bengaluru commuters shift back to private vehicles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/un-fare-deal-bengalureans-restart-own-vehicles/articleshow/128793617.cms,"Bengaluru: Ex-BBMP Engineer’s Suicide After Corruption Probe, Infant Injury at Hospital

Namma Metro Fare hike that was proposed

Reactions with mugshots:





BENGALURU: The huge gains of Metro as a friendly and efficient public transport are being undone by frequent fare hikes and last-mile connectivity woes. The perception that commuting by Metro in Bengaluru is becoming increasingly expensive is gaining ground: More commuters are returning to their personal vehicles, worsening traffic congestion across the city.While there is no data-based quantification yet (such as new vehicle sales in the recent past), both motorists and traffic police say they are witnessing a perceptible slowdown in traffic flow. Officers note a visible surge in the number of two-wheelers on city roads, especially during peak hours. Once seen as faster, safer and relatively affordable, Namma Metro is no longer the obvious first choice for many commuters.According to transport department data, Bengaluru city has over 80 lakh registered two-wheelers as of 2026. Traffic police fear that a renewed reliance on private vehicles will translate into longer travel times and mounting congestion in the coming months.Unni Krishna Menon, who earlier commuted by Metro between Jalahalli and Indiranagar, has now switched back to his car. ""While the Metro is convenient, the proposed fare hikes and last-mile connectivity gaps would make it less viable for me.Travelling from Jalahalli to Indiranagar costs around Rs 70 one way, and I pay Rs 30 for the first four hours of parking. On reaching Indiranagar, I still need an autorickshaw or a cab to reach my office in Domlur. Each day cost me Rs 220, but if I fill my car with Rs 500 petrol, I can go for 2.5 days, which is cheaper,"" Menon explained the commute math to TOI.Echoing this sentiment, college student Jatin Polanki said he has shifted to his bike, well almost. ""I used to take the Metro regularly in my first year, travelling from Pattanagere to Majestic for about Rs 30 one way. After the initial hike in fares and early classes, I started using a bike. In Rs 100, I can go to college, roam around, and come back.""Resident welfare groups warn that higher user charges for essential services could prove counterproductive. Christopher Cruz of NERWA said, ""Public transport is any city's lifeline and critical to decongesting the city. Revenue cannot be a consideration. Making the Metro expensive in a city like Bengaluru, already infamous for traffic, is counterproductive.""Some commuters argue that cost alone is not the deciding factor. Techie Naresh Sadasivan said, ""Public transport will win 10 out of 10 times if it offers good connectivity and user experience. What pushes people to private transport is unpredictability and poor interconnectivity. Fix that, and people will pay a fair price.""0–2 km: Rs 11 (previously Rs 10)2–4 km: Rs 21 (previously Rs 20)4–6 km: Rs 32 (previously Rs 30)6–8 km: Rs 42 (previously Rs 40)8–10 km: Rs 53 (previously Rs 50)10–15 km: Rs 63 (previously Rs 60)15–20 km: Rs 74 (previously Rs 70)20–25 km: Rs 84 (previously Rs 80)25–30 km / Above 30 km: Rs 95 (previously Rs 90)Ramdev Satyanarayana, RWA, Konankunte""The Metro fare hike is concerning for the commuter. Though I have access to both a car and a two-wheeler, I consciously chose Metro because it is safer, faster, and far more convenient. However, fare hikes leave commuters like me with little choice but to reconsider our travel options. Such increases risk discouraging daily commuters who depend on affordable public transport. Keeping the Metro accessible is crucial not just for commuters, but also for reducing traffic congestion and promoting sustainable urban mobility. ""Shivkumar V, general secretary, Domlur Layout Resident Welfare Association""The repeated fare increases place a direct burden on the common man, another steep revision is unfair. This will inevitably push people back to private vehicles or already overcrowded public buses, worsening road congestion.""Shany Sunny, Joint Secretary, Indiranagar Stage 1 RWA""I know of friends and family members who shifted back to bikes. The primary reason is the increase in fares — for many, travelling by bike is cost-effective. An overcrowded Metro no longer feels like a comfortable escape from the daily commute rush. While it may help avoid vehicular pollution, the experience itself is stressful due to the heavy crowd.""","More commuters are returning to their personal vehicles, worsening traffic congestion.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday launched the nationwide Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccination Programme, targeting girls aged 14 years across all States and Union Territories.The initiative was launched during his visit to Ajmer, Rajasthan. It aims at preventing cervical cancer and is part of the government’s larger effort to strengthen women’s health and advance preventive healthcare across the country.The programme will cover approximately 1.15 crore girls each year and the vaccine will be provided free of cost at designated government health facilities, including Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (Primary Health Centres), Community Health Centres, Sub-District and District Hospitals, and Government Medical Colleges.Vaccination will be voluntary, with parental or guardian consent obtained before administration. Each session will be supervised by trained medical officers and supported by skilled healthcare teams. All sites will have functional Cold Chain Points and access to 24x7 government health facilities to manage any rare Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI).In a post on X, PM Modi wrote, ""We are leaving no stone unturned to ensure that the daughters of the country are healthy and prosperous.In this direction, this morning, around 11:30 AM, I will launch the nationwide HPV vaccination campaign in Ajmer, Rajasthan. The objective of this initiative is the prevention of cervical cancer. During this time, I will also have the opportunity to lay the foundation stones and inaugurate several projects, along with handing over appointment letters to my young colleagues.

If police can’t verify complaint before FIR, who else will: SC

NEW DELHI: In an unusual introspective remark, Chief Justice Surya Kant-led bench of the Supreme Court on Friday said on several occasions the apex court passes sweeping orders unmindful of India’s social ground realities and without understanding their adverse impact on the social fabric.When a bunch of petitions challenging the validity of the sedition provision in BNS and a provision in BNSS allowing police to conduct preliminary inquiry prior to registration of FIR came up for hearing, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy said permitting police to conduct preliminary inquiry prior to registration of FIR was in violation of SC ruling in the 2014 Lalita Kumari judgment.The SC in the 2014 judgment had ruled that if a complaint disclosed a cognizable offence, then the police must immediately register an FIR but can conduct preliminary inquiry into such complaints relating to matrimonial disputes, medical negligence and some other categories of cases.CJI Kant said, to test the validity of provisions of any new law, one must wait for a few years to observe its working and on finding lacunae; the same could be challenged. “Do you know how Lalita Kumari ruling is abused by filing frivolous cases for registration of FIRs? How judicial forums are abused,” he asked.The CJI said, “In some cases, we pass sweeping orders as if sitting in ivory towers and without realising the social realities in the country.Frivolous complaints lodged in the heat of the moment in rural areas, when converted to FIRs, have the potential of causing deep animosity in society.”Justice Kant said, “We pass sweeping orders in the name of protecting fundamental rights which in reality disturb the social fabric.” Guruswamy said how can the police have the power to determine the veracity of a complaint at the time of registration of FIR to argue that police can do so after registering the FIR.The bench said, “If police can’t determine the veracity of the complaint prior to converting it into an FIR, who else will?” Justice Bagchi said, “Lalita Kumar judgment gives the power of preliminary inquiry power to police in several categories of cases, including matrimonial disputes. Legislature has reflected this aspect in the law with respect to the degree of punishment provided for the offences. Such a provision cannot be at the teeth of Lalita Kumari judgment. ”Guruswamy argued that the sedition provision was incorporated in BNS despite Union govt undertaking before the SC not to do it. SC said, “Union govt can give such an undertaking. But Parliament is not bound by it. Parliament has the exclusive power to enact legislation. While testing its validity, SC can interpret and read it down.” It posted the petitions for a detailed hearing in March second week.","Cji kant said, to test the validity of provisions of any new law, one must wait for a few years to observe its working and on finding lacunae. “do you know how lalita kumari ruling is abused by filing frivolous cases for registration of firs?

Govt cannot be stuck with the conditions envisaged and drafted in the 1940s.""In its order, the CJI-led bench said, ""Operation of the impugned order shall remain stayed.

NEW DELHI: To determine whether an OBC woman candidate came within the creamy layer to be disentitled from reservation in govt employment, what should be taken into consideration - income of her husband or that of her parents? Supreme Court has agreed to examine this question.The woman, aspiring to become a judicial officer in Karnataka, belongs to the Hindu Namadhari community which is under II-A of reserved category. In April 2018, she married a man who belongs to III-B of reserved category, and has been residing separately from her parents since then. She has applied for the post of civil judge, where six posts out of 57 are reserved for candidates belonging to category II-A.After her selection, she sought verification of her caste certificate and issuance of 'Sindhutva' certificate based on her husband's income. The district caste and income verification committee rejected her application saying she belonged to the creamy layer owing to the quantum of her parent's income.Her mother had retired as a district judge from Karnataka judicial service, and her father retired as assistant conservator of forest. She contended before Karnataka HC that eligibility of a married woman should be decided on her husband's income and not that of her parents.She said her husband's annual income put her out of the purview of creamy layer disqualification.The state govt had argued that pension of parents should also be considered for this purpose.

""No Overarching Conspiracy"" Court Clears Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia In Excise Case

Icchadhari Naag

Kejriwal hits back with 'Congress has no shame' remark

NEW DELHI: The political tremors from the Delhi excise policy verdict rippled beyond the courtroom on Friday as the Congress lashed out at the ruling BJP, alleging that Arvind Kejriwal's discharge was timed against the backdrop of the Gujarat and Punjab elections.Kejriwal, who had briefly allied with the Congress ahead of the 2024 general elections, hit back at his former ally, accusing it of having ""no shame"" and drawing a contrast between AAP leaders going to jail and the Congress high command remaining out of legal clutch.Soon after a Delhi court granted relief to Kejriwal in the alleged liquor scam case, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera attacked the BJP, likening it to an """" (shape-shifting serpent).In a post on X, he alleged that the BJP was deploying central agencies as ""campaign tools"" with key state elections approaching, calling it ""vendetta as governance.""Khera argued that the BJP’s ideological positions were secondary to its ""obsessive goal"": the realisation of a ""Congress-Mukt Bharat."" He cited what he described as the party’s ""fluctuating relationship"" with the Trinamool Congress (TMC) as evidence of political opportunism.""The BJP is not a political party. It is a shape-shifter, a wishful serpent - Icchadhari Naag. It will stoop to any level for one obsessive goal: defeat Congress - Congress Mukt Bharat. For 12 years they spewed venom at the TMC. And now? Narendra Modi himself is showering it with praise - not out of respect, but to land a cheap blow at Congress,"" Khera's post read.Khera also predicted that cases against Congress leaders would intensify as elections draw closer, citing senior leader P Chidambaram as an example.""Elections are coming. So the script is predictable. Cases against Congress leaders will suddenly accelerate - @PChidambaram_IN has already been dragged back into the spotlight because Tamil Nadu is going for polls,"" he wrote in the post.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) recently granted prosecution sanction against Chidambaram in the Aircel Maxis Deal and INX Media cases.""Meanwhile, proceedings against their ""convenient allies"" in the AAP and others will quietly vanish in light of the Gujarat and Punjab elections,"" he wrote on X.Describing the developments as part of the ""BJP playbook,"" Khera alleged that the ruling party uses central agencies as ""campaign tools"".""This is the BJP playbook: vendetta as governance and agencies as campaign tools,"" he said.Responding to the Congress’ remarks, Kejriwal targeted Pawan Khera, who suggested that the narrative was being pushed to politically corner the Congress ahead of the Punjab and Gujarat elections.Questioning how many Congress leaders had gone to jail, the AAP supremo said the party had ""no shame.""""I want to ask the Congress - Kejriwal went to jail. Did Robert Vadra go to jail? Sanjay Singh went to jail. Did Rahul Gandhi go to jail? Sanjay Singh went to jail. Did Sonia Gandhi ji went to jail? What is Congress saying? Does it have no shame?"" Kejriwal asked.The political exchange followed a detailed order from a Special Court in Delhi, which held that the prosecution had failed to disclose ""even the threshold of a prima facie suspicion, far less the grave suspicion"" required for framing of charges in the CBI case linked to the Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22.In a strongly worded ruling, Special Judge (PC Act) Jitender Singh of the Rouse Avenue Court said the prosecution’s case was ""legally infirm, unsustainable, and unfit to proceed any further in law"".The court further observed that when the material collected by the agency was tested on admissibility, relevance and probative value, ""the appearance of a coherent conspiracy dissolves,"" exposing the allegations as being founded on inadmissible material and post-facto reconstruction.Among those discharged are Arvind Kejriwal, and former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and 21 others.The court was also critical of the Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI) reliance on approver statements, cautioning that granting pardon to an accused and then using his testimony to fill gaps in the prosecution’s case or implicate additional accused would undermine constitutional safeguards.The FIR in the case was registered in August 2022 following a complaint by Delhi Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena, alleging that the now-scrapped excise policy was designed to favour select liquor licensees by reducing licence fees and fixing profit margins, leading to kickbacks and losses to the exchequer.","The congress lashed out at the ruling bjp, alleging that arvind kejriwal's discharge was timed against the backdrop of the gujarat and punjab elections. Pawan khera argued that the bjp’s ideological positions were secondary to its ""obsessive goal"": the realisation of a ""congress-mukt bharat"" the case is linked to the delhi excise policy 2021-22.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128853174,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-47034,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
"Human brain can grow new cells, remain sharp even in 80s: Study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/human-brain-can-grow-new-cells-remain-sharp-even-in-80s-study/articleshow/128903724.cms,"New Delhi: For many people, ageing brings small lapses in memory. A forgotten name, a misplaced key. For others, memory loss becomes something more serious. Yet, some in their 80s remain as sharp as they were decades earlier.A paper published in the journal, 'Nature', suggests one reason for this may lie deep inside the brain's memory centre - in its ability to continue producing new cells even late in life. The study provides strong evidence that the adult human brain continues to generate new neurons in the hippocampus, the region crucial for learning and memory, though this process is disrupted by Alzheimer's disease.Using advanced single-cell genetic techniques, researchers analysed nearly 3,56,000 cells from postmortem hippocampus samples across age groups - from young adults to healthy elderly individuals, early Alzheimer's cases, diagnosed patients and 'SuperAgers' - identifying neural stem cells and immature neurons and tracing a clear pathway from stem cell to mature neuron.Age alone did not shut down this process. Healthy older adults still showed neuron formation. But in Alzheimer's, immature neurons were significantly fewer. Stem cells remained, yet their development into functioning neurons appeared impaired.Dr Manjari Tripathi, head of neurology at AIIMS, said this reflected neuronal plasticity - the brain's ability to adapt and renew itself even in adulthood. According to her, this can be strengthened through exercise, balanced diet, adequate sleep, reduced stress, strong social networks and control of cardiovascular risks.Sleep, in particular, is crucial for memory consolidation and neuronal sprouting. She noted that many 'SuperAgers' stayed mentally active and socially engaged.Researchers detected early molecular changes in individuals with Alzheimer's-related pathology but no symptoms, suggesting the disruption in renewal may begin years before memory decline appears.Dr Sudhir Kumar, neurologist at Apollo Hospital, Hyderabad, said adult neurogenesis occurred at a slower pace than in childhood but remain-ed functionally vital. New neurons are adaptable and help distinguish similar memories. He added if this regenerative capacity declined early in Alzheimer's, future diagnostics may detect it before symptoms appeared. Treatment, he suggested, should focus not only on clearing toxic proteins like amyloid but also on stren-gthening the brain's repair systems through targeted the-rapies and lifestyle measures.","The adult human brain continues to generate new neurons in the hippocampus, the region crucial for learning and memory.

When she calculated her weight again on Planet Venus, she was thrilled to find she weighed less than 46 kg. Rachna was one of the several youngsters who found out that their actual body weight was different on seven different planets of our solar system. These youngsters were not travelling in deep space but they were actually part of a gathering at Vigyan Utsav on Saturday that was organised by the Prime Minister’s Museum and Library (PMML) to celebrate the National Science Day.In the science pavilion at “Know your weight on different planets”, Rachna and the like also found out the exact answer to this astronomy puzzle about the different weights: “Weight on Neptune is 1.19 times the weight on Earth whereas the weight on Venus is 0.91 time the weight on Earth”.This explanation was mentioned on the posters that also stated that a person weighs more on Neptune than on Venus because Neptune has stronger surface gravity due to its higher mass.Besides the planet pavilion, the day-long event for children also featured free virtual reality shows and ‘Nukkad Nataks’. Hands-on science experiments, physics games and ‘Do It Yourself’ STEM kits were provided by organisations like Vigyan Vyanjan and KMC Astroclub — the astronomy club of Kirori Mal College of Delhi University.Speaking at the occasion, PMML director Ashwani Lohani said, “Such events showcase the deep roots of democracy in the country besides promoting scientific temper in this age of artificial intelligence.”Science & educational books, telescopes and DIY kits from various innovators were also on display. Hand-made paintings of pioneering physicist Dr C V Raman and missile-cum-space scientist and President Dr A P J Abdul Kalam were put up at the science fair for young science enthusiasts to draw inspiration from them.An event, themed ‘A Carnival of Curiosity’, was hosted by the Nehru Planetarium and PMML to foster a culture of scientific inquiry through interactive learning and entertainment.The PMML also celebrated the 130th birth anniversary of former PM Morarji Desai on this day. A panel exhibition on the life and contribution of the former PM was displayed on this occasion.","The event was organised by the prime minister’s museum and library (pmml) to celebrate the national science day.

Amit Shah Calls 2014–2026 A Golden Era For India’s Internal Security, Vows Maoism Eradication

NEW DELHI: A high-level meeting chaired by home minister Amit Shah in Purnea, Bihar on Friday to examine security-related concerns in border districts of the state, decided that all death cases reported after special intensive revision (SIR) will be thoroughly verified and matching deletions and updates carried out in all official records including aadhaar, driving licence and PAN databases etc, to ensure accuracy and prevent any misuse.A door-to-door survey will be undertaken to verify individuals reported as migrated but absent during verification, while ensuring that no genuine voter is erroneously deleted, Central govt sources told TOI.The review meeting examined -- attended by the district magistrates and superintendents of police of seven border districts of Seemanchal -- called for stricter border management, enhanced vigilance against illegal activities, and coordinated inter-agency action to address concerns such as illegal constructions near border areas, illegal migration, circulation of fake Indian currency notes (FICN), encroachment, and unauthorised financial flows.Shah, during the meeting, called for strict enforcement of a zero-tolerance policy against illegal constructions, particularly in forest and uninhabited areas, and ordered the immediate removal of encroachments in 'no man's land' adjoining the international border.District magistrates of border districts have been tasked with ensuring legal and financial compliance by all banks, including cooperative banks, within their jurisdictions. All banks have been directed to follow compliances issued by RBI , including reporting of cash transactions of high value and PAN linkage with bank accounts.Bihar chief secretary will review compliance, particularly concerning cooperative banks. Strict action will be taken against sub registrar offices (SROs) that fail to report or resort to defective reporting of high-value property transactions or violations involving cash transactions beyond prescribed norms. The Bihar govt will raise the issue in the state-level bankers' committee (SLBC) and take up with the RBI, the installation of note-sorting machines in all bank branches along the border, while also ensuring adequate banking penetration in border areas.The district magistrates have also been asked to verify major business establishments to ensure that sources of financing them are legitimate and not linked to unlawful activities. In cases of property purchases by suspicious elements, their funding sources, purchasing capacity, and PAN details will be thoroughly examined.","A high-level meeting chaired by home minister amit shah in purnea, bihar on friday to examine security-related concerns in border districts of the state.

MUMBAI: The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) on Saturday released its preliminary report into the fatal Learjet 45XR crash at Baramati on January 28, highlighting low visibility, lack of basic meteorological facilities and operational gaps at the uncontrolled airfield. All five persons on board were killed, among them was the then Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar.The aircraft, VT-SSK, operated by VSR Ventures Pvt. Ltd., was on a non-scheduled passenger flight from Mumbai to Baramati. The accident occurred at about 0846 IST during landing. The jet carried two pilots, one cabin attendant and two passengers.The report states that Baramati airfield does not have a MET facility.Weather parameters such as wind, temperature and QNH are passed from a temporary tower using available instruments, while visibility is assessed through visual markers identified by flying training organisations. On the morning of the accident, the tower assessed visibility at about 3,000 metres, below the 5 km minimum required for VFR operations. METAR data from Pune showed visibility between 2,000 and 2,500 metres during the relevant window.The first approach to runway 11 resulted in a go-around. During the second approach, the crew reported the field in sight and was cleared to land. The aircraft later transmitted “Oh st… Oh st…” before crash-landing to the left of runway 11 abeam the threshold. It struck trees and terrain about 50 metres from the runway edge and was engulfed in fire. The cockpit and cabin were destroyed.The solid-state flight data recorder has been downloaded. The cockpit voice recorder, which sustained thermal damage, will be analysed with assistance from the US National Transportation Safety Board and the manufacturer.In its interim safety recommendations, the AAIB said:“It is recommended that DGCA may issue necessary directions to all operators operating VFR flights to uncontrolled airfields to strictly adhere to the laid down standard operating procedures. Further, necessary directions may also be issued to all the aerodrome operators/organisations responsible for handling the aerodrome services at the uncontrolled airfields to ensure that the flying operations (including Non-scheduled/Private/Charter operations) in the airfield is allowed only when the prevailing MET conditions are within the criteria laid down in the relevant DGCA regulations. ”“It is recommended that DGCA may issue specific directions to all the stakeholders responsible to manage and maintain the uncontrolled airfields to ensure that required safety standards are maintained at the airport for safe aircraft operations. Compliance of the same may be checked during audit/surveillance.”“It is recommended that DGCA may take necessary measures to enhance the landing aids along with basic MET facility at these airports to cater for large number of Non-scheduled/chartered flights (including VIP flights) being carried out at these airports apart from flying training activities.”“It is recommended that DGCA may check the feasibility of licensing these aerodromes for conduct of safe and regulated flying operations.”The investigation is in progress.","The aircraft, vt-ssk, operated by vsr ventures pvt.
