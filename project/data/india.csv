"BJP misusing agencies, FIR baseless: AAP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-misusing-agencies-fir-baseless-aap/articleshow/122122478.cms,"NEW DELHI: Alleging ""blatant misuse"" of agencies to defame its leaders, AAP on Thursday questioned why the first information report filed against former Delhi ministers Saurabh Bharadwaj and Satyendar Jain was being kept under wraps and ""selective"" press notes were being leaked to the media.Bharadwaj, who is Delhi AAP convener, alleged that only two former ministers were named in the case without any reasonable cause while all the officers of the health and public works departments, who were actually responsible for executing the hospital projects, were spared. ""Is the FIR so baseless that BJP fears it will become a national joke if released publicly?"" AAP asked.The party issued a press statement saying the anti-corruption branch admitted in its own documents that the projects in question were sanctioned in 2017-18 and the health information management system was announced in 2016-17, much before Bharadwaj assumed office in 2023. ""On June 24, 2025, LG Vinai Saxena issued a press note, and today, Delhi ACB head Madhur Verma also issued a press note to the media. The LG and ACB are deliberately withholding the FIR because it would expose the mockery of law being orchestrated by BJP govt,"" Bharadwaj said, claiming that releasing the FIR to the media in criminal cases was a ""standard practice"".Jain alleged that both the LG and the ACB head in their press notes mentioned different time periods when the projects were sanctioned. ""There is, as yet, no evidence to suggest that these project sanctions were marred by corruption. Moreover, all these sanctions predate Saurabh Bharadwaj's tenure. How can a minister be held liable for actions taken two to five years before assuming office? Is this some kind of joke?"" Jain questioned.Bharadwaj claimed there was not a shred of evidence to suggest corruption in the announcement of the projects and the hospital management system, and holding him responsible for the alleged crimes was ""beyond comprehension"".","Aap accuses agencies of ""blatant misuse"" of agencies to defame its leaders. Former delhi ministers saurabh bharadwaj and satyendar jain named in first information report. Aap says anti-corruption branch admitted projects in question were sanctioned in 2017-18.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122122613,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1030447,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
IIT-Madras eyes global top 50 with major expansion plans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iit-madras-eyes-global-top-50-with-major-expansion-plans/articleshow/122122083.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian Institutes of Technology and IISc are unlikely to break into the list of world’s top 50 universities unless they run full-fledged medical colleges, IIT-Madras director Professor V Kamakoti has said, revealing that the institution is considering setting up a medical college to overcome this gap in its portfolio.In an exclusive interaction with TOI, Kamakoti said IIT-M has already begun internal discussions on establishing a medical college, which would be integrated with its engineering and science departments, as part of its long-term vision, and is looking for a large hospital.Further, the institution has planned a global outreach through its proposed research centres in Dubai, Malaysia, and Germany and a sustainability campus in Puducherry, another important parameter for global rankings that Indian institutions lag on. In what’s an unconventional move, IIT-M has formalised a platform to help its students prepare for civil services exams.“If you want to come into top 50 (in global rankings), you must have a medical school,” Kamakoti stressed, adding, “The top-ranked universities all have global campuses, deep-research collaborations, and, critically, medical schools”.He added: “This is not just about rankings — it’s about enabling convergence in areas like AI in healthcare, biomedical engineering, and public health.A medical college will amplify our research depth and societal impact”.On the plan for developing a sustainability-focused campus in Puducherry, the director said, “This campus will be a living laboratory for climate, water, and energy research”. Explaining the move, he added: “Sustainability is now a global benchmark in rankings. That’s why we’ve started School of Sustainability under School for Interdisciplinary Studies. It’s aligned with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Every project must resonate with these goals — from green tech to zero-emission housing. Auroville collaborations in Puducherry are a part of this vision”.To expand global footprint, the institution will go for research collaborations and set up satellite centres in Dubai, Malaysia, and Germany. These will encourage Indian researchers to work on global problems and offer Indian students cross-border learning.“It’s called IITM Global,” Kamakoti said, detailing the vision behind the international outreach. “If you solve an issue for India, you’ve solved it for the world. Our IITM Global will take these to Malaysia, Germany, Dubai (by this academic year), and beyond.”Kamakoti also highlighted IIT-M’s initiative to nurture engineers for civil services. To enable this, institute has created Pragati, a platform to guide and support UPSC aspirants on campus. “We want our students to start early — during BTech or MTech — with structured preparation, peer interactions, and access to faculty and civil servants who’ve walked that path,” he said.“We’re not just a tech school anymore — we’re shaping India’s future in several ways,” Kamakoti summed up.",Indian institutes of technology and iisc are unlikely to break into the list of world’s top 50 universities unless they run full-fledged medical colleges.

Poll Do you believe that the investigation into the Air India Dreamliner crash will uncover the true causes within a month? Yes, the investigation will be thorough. No, it will take longer.





NEW DELHI: Data from a black box of the Air India Dreamliner that crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12 has been downloaded at Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau lab, govt said Thursday. Intitial information about causes leading to the accident is likely to be known in the next seven to 10 days.With the black boxes being examined locally, the final report is expected to be out in a month, instead of the six-month time frame given earlier, sources said. Civil aviation ministry said the crash protection module from the front black box was safely retrieved, and on Wednesday, the memory module was accessed.While the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) of AI-171 which crashed within minutes of take-off was recovered on June 13, the Flight Data Recorders (FDR) were found in the debris three days later.Like the earlier practice, this time too, there were plans to send the black boxes to the US for examination, especially as it involved the first Dreamliner crash. But on the suggestion of the top leadership, it was decided to send them to the AAIB lab, sources said.As a result, the two were flown to Delhi in separate Indian Air Force planes last Tuesday.“The analysis of CVR and FDR data is under way. These efforts aim to reconstruct the sequence of events leading to the accident and identify contributing factors to enhance aviation safety and prevent future occurrences. All actions have been taken in full compliance with domestic laws and international obligations in a time-bound manner,” the official statement said.Information about the causes is being expected in record time, in less than a month, as this is the first example of the data of a plane that crashed in Indian territory being examined in the country’s labs itself, said a senior official. The lab is compliant with international standards.A team of over 20 experts from National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in the US, who arrived in Ahmedabad on June 13, are now in the Capital, examining the data with Indian experts.The delay in announcing the composition of the team probing the AI-171 crash a fortnight after the accident has raised questions about the investigation. The govt statement defended the process followed.“Following the unfortunate accident (on June 12), AAIB promptly initiated an investigation and constituted a multi-disciplinary team on June 13, 2025, in line with prescribed norms. The team, constituted as per international protocol, is led by DG AAIB, and includes an aviation medicine specialist, an air traffic control (ATC) officer, and representatives from NTSB which is the govt investigating agency from the state of manufacture and design (US), as required for such investigations,” it said. Apart from DG AAIB GVG Yugandhar, names of others on the probe panel have so far not been made public.","Data from a black box of the air india dreamliner that crashed in ahmedabad on june 12 has been downloaded.

"20 years after split, Uddhav & Raj join hands to oppose 'Hindi imposition' in Maharashtra",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/20-years-after-split-uddhav-raj-join-hands-to-oppose-hindi-imposition-in-maharashtra/articleshow/122120333.cms,"Speculation rife about Uddhav, Raj joining hands for BMC polls

MUMBAI: Uddhav and Raj Thackeray will hold a joint protest march of their parties here on July 5 against what they allege is the imposition of Hindi in Maharashtra's schools from Class 1 through the new three-language policy.This will be the first time that the two will come together on a political platform after Raj's decision to quit Shiv Sena to form MNS nearly two decades ago.There has been speculation of a possible reunion of the estranged cousins for the coming civic polls; the protest march is being seen as the first step in that direction.Initially, Uddhav and Raj had on Thursday announced two separate marches: on July 6 and 7 respectively.According to Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut, Raj dialled him Friday and said it would not be good to hold two marches for the Marathi language in this way and a joint movement could have a big impact. Raut said he then spoke to Uddhav, who agreed ""without hesitation."" The march will mostly be from Girgaum Chowpatty to Azad Maidan. Both parties have said it will be non-political and no party flags will be displayed.MNS functionary Sandeep Deshpande and Sena (UBT) MLA Varun Sardesai also met on Friday at a restaurant in Dadar (W), further fuelling speculation that the parties would come together not just for the protest but for the BMC polls too.Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray also met Deshpande at an event on Friday, where they greeted each other; Deshpande has fought the 2024 assembly polls against Aaditya from Worli and lost.Marathi language expert Deepak Pawar, who had called for a protest on July 7, said Marathi language activists will join the July 5 protest and continue protests on July 7 if govt doesn't roll back its three-language policy. The opposition and several groups have criticized the state govt, alleging it is trying to impose Hindi as the third language, though the govt has said Hindi is not mandatory.After issuing a GR on June 17 on the third-language policy, the govt took two steps back this week, first by saying it would have wide-ranging consultations before finalizing the policy and second by saying the third language would be taught via the play-way method, only orally, in Class 1 and 2, with no textbooks for students and no tests or exams.Raut said Raj initially told him he had no idea about the UBT Sena's march.When he discussed Raj's message of having one march with Uddhav Thackeray , Raut said that ""he said he too was not in favour of a separate march but as July 6 is Ashadhi Ekadashi, it would be difficult to reach the people. I conveyed this to Raj Thackeray. After talking to Uddhav Thackeray, we suggested July 5 as the date. Raj Thackeray agreed to it after talking to his colleagues... This march will be without any political agenda. Through it, govt will see the strength of the Marathi people.""Education minister Dada Bhuse had met Raj on Thursday to explain the govt's stand, but Raj had said the govt's view wasn't acceptable. Deshpande said, ""Raj Thackeray took the initiative and called Sanjay Raut and the date of the march was decided. We are inviting all parties, including Marathi-loving office-bearers of BJP and Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena.""It's a good thing the Thackerays are keeping aside political differences and coming together as Marathi manoos. They will decide if they will come together politically. For now, we are focusing on the march.""The protest will change the political direction of Maharashtra. The protest is not Raj or Uddhav Thackeray's, it belongs to the Marathi manoos.""Sardesai said there was dialogue between Sena (UBT) and MNS. ""We are asking everyone to join the protest, so we met to plan the march,"" he said.MNS functionaries said they were reaching out to Congress, NCP and NCP (SP) netas along with other parties and organisations to invite them for the march.",Uddhav and raj thackeray will hold a joint protest march of their parties on july 5.

NEW DELHI: The medical examination of the 24-year-old law student, who was gang-raped inside South Calcutta Law College allegedly by an alumnus and two senior students, has confirmed signs of brutal sexual assault including “forceful penetration, bite marks and nail scratches on her body,” a Kolkata Police officer told PTI.The incident took place on the evening of June 25 inside a guard’s room adjacent to the student union office, police said, after the woman was reportedly assaulted for rejecting a marriage proposal from the main accused.The three men, including a practising criminal lawyer and two senior students have been arrested and remanded to police custody for four days. Forensic experts have sealed the crime scene and seized mobile phones of the accused for further investigation.According to the complaint filed at Kasba police station, the student had visited the college to fill out exam forms when she was asked to stay back. She alleged that after refusing a marriage proposal from the prime accused, she was physically assaulted, dragged into a room, and raped while the other two accused stood guard. The ordeal allegedly lasted over three hours, from around 7.30 pm to 10.30 pm.The survivor further told police that she was filmed during the assault and threatened with the release of the footage.She was also warned against informing anyone, with threats made against her boyfriend and family, police sources told PTI.“We are trying to find out whether the footage was forwarded to other numbers,” the officer added.Chief Public Prosecutor Sourin Ghosal told PTI that, “According to a Supreme Court judgement, all persons in a group involved in cases of gang rape must be held liable, even if all of them did not commit the act of rape. In this case, two other persons helped in the rape. So this is a case of gang rape, and they are also accused in the case.”The prime accused, a former student of the law college, had been hired as temporary non-teaching staff for 45 days. His social media profiles claimed he was a former president of the college's Trinamool Congress Chhatra Parishad (TMCP) unit and a current office-bearer of the south Kolkata wing of the TMC’s student body. Photos circulating online also show him alongside senior leaders of the ruling party.The Trinamool Congress has denied any current link with the accused and demanded ""severe punishment"" if he is found guilty.The case has triggered political uproar and street protests. Supporters of the SFI-DYFI clashed with police outside Kasba police station on Friday. Protesters from the BJP, Congress and AIDSO were also detained following separate demonstrations.Leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari has warned of escalating protests, while both the BJP and Congress have announced agitation programmes for Saturday.TMCP president Trinankur Bhattacharya distanced the organisation from the accused, saying the student union at the college has been defunct for years.State Minister Shashi Panja, addressing a press conference, said, “The state government stands firmly with the victim and her family. Instead of making the victim a battleground for politics, her pain must be understood, she must be respected, and justice must be ensured – swiftly and unconditionally.”The National Commission for Women has taken suo motu cognisance of the case and directed Kolkata Police to submit a detailed report within three days.The case has drawn comparisons with the August 2023 rape and murder of a medical intern at RG Kar Medical College, which also sparked widespread outrage and calls for better campus safety measures across West Bengal.(With inputs fro agencies)","Law student gangraped inside kolkata college; tmc youth leader among 3 arrested.

NEW DELHI: Senior Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Kalyan Banerjee on Friday sparked controversy with his remark on the Kolkata law college rape case, saying, “What can be done if a friend rapes his friend?""Banerjee, who is also the MP from Serampore Lok Sabha constituency, further asked: ""Will the police be there in schools? This was done by students to another student. Who will protect her (victim)?""The TMC leader, however, said that the accused should be arrested.""I am not an advocate into the incident that occurred at the Law College but the accused should be arrested. A few men commit this type of crime...But what can be done if a friend rapes his friend. Will the police be there in schools? This was done by students to another student. Who will protect her (victim)? This (South Calcutta Law College) is a government college. Will the police always be there?"" Kalyan Banerjee told news agency ANI.In the incident at Kolkata law college, which is the eerily reminiscent of the gut-wrenching RG Kar case, a student was allegedly raped on the night of June 25 within the premises, leading to the arrest of three men, two students and a staff member who is also an alumnus of the institution.Police identified the accused as Manojit Mishra (31), Zaib Ahmed (19), and Pramit Mukhopadhyay alias Pramit Mukherjee (20).Kolkata Police on Thursday identified Manojit Mishra as a former president of the institution’s Trinamool Congress Chhatra Parishad unit and the organisational secretary of the south Kolkata wing of the TMC’s student body.Photographs of Mishra circulating in the public domain also show him in close proximity to several senior leaders of the ruling Trinamool Congress.College authorities confirmed that Mishra had been working at the institute as a temporary non-teaching staff member on a 45-day renewable contractual basis. He is also a practising criminal lawyer at the Alipore Police and Sessions Court.The vice principal of the college, Dr Nayna Chatterji, said Mishra's appointment was made “on the basis of a resolution passed by the governing body (GB) of the institute.”According to Kolkata Police, the alleged assault took place on June 25 inside a guard’s room located on the ground floor of the college, adjacent to the students' union office.""Initial investigations revealed that the victim had reached the college in the afternoon to fill up certain academic forms after she was called by some people,"" officials told news agency PTI.

Poor Cibil score costs TN man bank job; Madras HC upholds decision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/poor-cibil-score-costs-tn-man-bank-job-hc-upholds-decision/articleshow/122121134.cms,"CHENNAI: Asserting that a person with poor or no financial discipline cannot be trusted with public money, Madras high court confirmed State Bank of India's decision cancelling the appointment of a circle-based officer (CBO) due to a poor Cibil score.""...the bank took a prudent decision that candidates with a history of default in repayment of loans and adverse Cibil reports were ineligible. The probable rationale behind the criteria may be that in the banking business employees deal with public money and, therefore, financial discipline needs to be strictly maintained,"" Justice N Mala said.Further, there must be efficiency in handling public money and, obviously, a person with poor or no financial discipline cannot be trusted with public money, she added.The court's observations came while dismissing a plea moved by P Karthikeyan challenging the SBI order dated April 9, 2021 cancelling his appointment as CBO.According to the petitioner, on the date of notification of the recruitment, he did not have dues or an adverse report in repayment of loans/credit card as he had cleared all loans. He was not declared a defaulter by the Cibil report, or by any other agency, and therefore the order cancelling his appointment as a defaulter was illegal and liable to be set aside, his counsel said.Opposing the plea, SBI submitted that one stipulated eligibility criteria was that candidates with records of default in repayment of loans, adverse reports by Cibil or other external agencies were not eligible for appointment. Since the petitioner gave a false declaration, his appointment was cancelled, SBI counsel C Mohan said. The petitioner's Cibil report revealed an adverse credit history in repayment of loans and credit card usage, and therefore the petitioner was found ineligible under Clause 1(E) of the eligibility criteria, he added.Concurring with the submissions, the court dismissed the petition.",Madras high court confirms state bank of india's decision cancelling the appointment of a circle-based officer (cbo) due to a poor cibil score.

The Ratlam district administration on learning about the incident immediately ordered a probe into the incident and sealed the petrol pump and booked its owner.Chief minister Mohan Yadav and VIPs were supposed to arrive at the airstrip in Ratlam on Friday morning and were supposed to be taken to the venue in vehicles that were sourced from an Indore-based travel agent.

"Now a star in orbit, Shubhanshu Shukla was always a natural in the sky",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/now-a-star-in-orbit-shubhanshu-shukla-was-always-a-natural-in-the-sky/articleshow/122118986.cms,"BENGALURU: He was the kind of cadet who didn’t just learn to fly — he belonged in the sky. Years before Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla became the first Indian to board the International Space Station (ISS), he was already turning heads in the cockpit of a Super Dimona aircraft at the National Defence Academy (NDA).Back then, he was just another cadet from the Hunter Squadron — call sign not yet famous, dreams still earthbound. But to the instructor watching closely from the co-pilot’s seat, one thing was clear: the young man had wings.“He had a natural flair for flying,” recalled Group Captain (retd) Anupam Banerjee, Shukla’s first flying instructor at NDA. “In just the first few sorties, we could tell. Some cadets struggle with the feel of the controls or spatial awareness. Not Shukla. He was confident, intuitive — a very natural flier.”It was 20 years ago. The aircraft was an Austrian-built HK-36TC Super Dimona, used for ab-initio flying exposure at NDA before cadets move on to formal pilot training at the Air Force Academy.Shux, as Banerjee recalled, aced those initial flights — an early indication of the career that lay ahead: Jaguars, test pilot school, and finally, a ride to low-Earth orbit on Axiom-4 (Ax-4).But what truly stood out, Banerjee said, wasn’t just skill. “He was sincere, extremely hardworking, and that’s a rare combination when paired with ability. I told him then — you’ll go far if you keep this up.”Years later, when Shukla was preparing for spaceflight, he sent Banerjee a message. He hadn’t forgotten the words. “He told me he remembered what I’d said: that it’s not enough to be a good flier or officer — you must be a good human being. That stayed with him. And when he told me that, it meant a lot.”Banerjee had flown with Shukla only seven or eight times, but the connection endured. “He always stayed in touch. Not many do. Whenever he reached a big moment in life, he’d send a message. That says a lot about the man he’s become.”Before launch, the two had one last conversation. “I knew he was about to enter quarantine, so I wished him luck. I told him life had already prepared him for what was coming. And that, a part of me was going to space with him.”Watching Shukla dock with the ISS, Banerjee says he felt something beyond pride. “It’s still unbelievable to me — that someone I trained, someone who first flew with me, is now in space. It’s not just about reaching orbit. It’s about who he is as a person. That matters even more.”In a way, Shukla’s story is a flight path traced not just in the sky, but in character. “When your students do well, you feel proud. But when they turn out to be fine human beings too — that’s greater joy.”So yes, Shux may now be astronaut number 634. But long before he floated weightlessly in a pressurised module, he was already soaring — on skill, sincerity, and the sort of quiet steel that can’t be taught.","Group captain shubhanshu shukla became the first indian to board the international space station (iss) he was already turning heads in the cockpit of a super dimona aircraft at the national defence academy (nda) his instructor, anupam banerjee, says he was confident, intuitive and a natural flier.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122119024,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-416194,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
"Two J&K ex-ministers quit Azad’s party, rejoin Congress",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/two-jk-ex-ministers-quit-azads-party-rejoin-congress/articleshow/122118855.cms,"SRINAGAR: The Ghulam Nabi Azad-led Democratic Progressive Azad Party (DPAP), launched in 2022, suffered a major setback as its last two prominent faces returned to the Congress fold on Friday. With this, the former J&K chief minister’s ambitious plan to provide an alternative political force in the UT now seems like a closed chapter.In the past few months, Azad himself has not shown any interest in reviving his party as he has not held any meeting.Former ministers Taj Mohiuddin and Ghulam Nabi Saroori, who were among the first to leave Congress and join DPAP in Aug 2022, rejoined Congress at the party headquarters in Srinagar. Regretting his earlier decision to leave the party, Mohiuddin said: “Congress has always been my home. Leaving it was a painful and unfortunate decision.” Saroori described his return as a “ghar wapsi” (homecoming).Both Saroori and Mohideen, who had been with Congress for decades before they parted ways, had been planning their return for the past few months. “Congress is like an ocean,” Mohiuddin said.J&K Congress president Tariq Hameed Karra said the return of the two ex-ministers would strengthen the party.“There are others also who want to rejoin, and we are considering each case one by one,” Karra said. Last month, DPAP Kashmir president, Mohammad Amin Bhat, had rejoined Congress.On April 14, Azad had announced the dissolution of his party organisation as part of a restructuring exercise, but there was no development thereafter. The move came nearly six months after DPAP’s rout in the Oct 2024 Assembly polls despite Azad’s intensive campaigning across J&K. The party contested 23 out of 90 seats, but could not secure a single victory.After Azad founded DPAP, nearly 90 per cent of Congress representatives in J&K joined him, leaving the grand old party virtually defunct in the UT. However, most of them have returned to the Congress fold. Around 20 prominent political representatives quit Azad’s party after Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra in 2023.",Dpap suffered a major setback as its last two prominent faces returned to the congress fold on friday.

He has been in jail since 2019 in a terror funding case.An AIP spokesperson said, “This hunger strike seeks to highlight the deafening silence of national parties about the hundreds of Kashmiris languishing in Tihar Jail and other prisons under draconian laws like UAPA, merely for political beliefs.”He said Rashid conveyed his decision at a meeting with his family and asserted that the hypocrisy of both BJP and Congress in accusing each other of throttling democracy must be exposed. Both the parties “are partners in crime when it comes to snatching the constitutional, democratic and human rights of Kashmiris,” the MP told his family as per the spokesperson.“While BJP is correctly highlighting the atrocities committed during the 1975 Emergency, it conveniently forgets how it has treated Kashmiris over the past 11 years, jailing legitimate political voices, silencing dissent and branding political belief as criminality.
