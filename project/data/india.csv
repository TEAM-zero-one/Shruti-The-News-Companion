NEW DELHI: Nitin Nabin will take over as BJP national president on Tuesday after emerging, as widely expected, as the sole candidate in fray, with the party’s leading figures from PM Narendra Modi , his cabinet colleagues and CMs, besides hundreds of electors from across country, endorsing his choice for the top organisational job.Modi, who signed the nomination paper in Nabin’s support but was not physically present at party headquarters Monday, is expected to be there when he formally assumes office. Other senior members, including Union ministers Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh and CMs Yogi Adityanath, Mohan Yadav and Nayab Saini, turned up at the venue to be part of the set-piece occasion.K Laxman, party MP and returning officer for the poll, said after nomination process that Nabin is the only contestant in fray. In BJP’s history since its foundation in 1980, its president has always been a consensus choice and never faced electoral contest. A formal announcement of his elevation is scheduled for Tuesday.“I announce that only one name, that of Nitin Nabin, has been proposed for post of national president of BJP,” he said. Nabin (45), currently BJP working president and fifth-term MLA from Bihar, will take over the mantle from JP Nadda six years after the Himachal politician had taken up the position.Nabin will be its youngest-ever president.All 36 organisational states of BJP were part of the nomination-filing process besides its parliamentary party, which included Modi and Shah among others in what was seen a display of wide support for Nabin. Laxman said all 37 sets of nomination were found valid.Ministers and state presidents were seen patiently waiting for their state’s turn — an alphabetical order was followed for different units, to file their nomination in support of Nabin’s candidature. Nabin is expected to preside over his first formal meeting with office bearers in a couple of days.BJP’s Anurag Thakur said election of a young president conveys Modi’s call to Gez Z to be part of politics. Modi and BJP have shown they practice what they preach, he added.","Bjp picks nitin nabin as national president,to take charge january 20. Nabin will be its youngest-ever president.

HC refuses to suspend Sengar jail term in custody death case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-refuses-to-suspend-sengar-jail-term-in-custody-death-case/articleshow/126732828.cms,"Unnao Rape Case: Delhi HC Rejects Kuldeep Sengar’s Plea To Suspend Sentence

NEW DELHI: Less than a month after his release was stayed by Supreme Court in the main rape case, Delhi high court on Monday refused to suspend a 10-year jail term handed to expelled BJP functionary Kuldeep Singh Sengar for the custodial death of the Unnao rape survivor’s father.“The offence committed is of grave magnitude and has a deep societal impact,” Justice Ravinder Dudeja observed, rejecting relief sought on the grounds of delay in trial. The HC pointed out that the delay was partly caused by the multiple applications Sengar’s legal team filed in the matter.“Purpose would be served if the appeal were heard on merit in an expeditious manner,” the HC said, listing the appeal for hearing on Feb3.HC said it was “noteworthy” that Sengar has “criminal antecedents in as much as he was convicted in a connected case for the rape of a minor and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment. The existence of such serious antecedents is a significant consideration and militates strongly against suspension (of the sentence).”It highlighted the findings of the trial court that Sengar was a key participant in the conspiracy and that the assault on the rape survivor’s father, and the subsequent falsification of the FIR, were part of that design.“Those findings form the basis of the conviction of the appellant and cannot be set aside lightly at the stage of deciding application for suspension of sentence,” the HC noted.On the argument that circumstances changed since his conviction, the HC said, “No exceptional or compelling circumstance was brought to the fore that would warrant suspension of sentence at this stage. The argument that the appellant underwent approximately 7.5 years of total imprisonment of 10 years RI awarded to him also does not advance his case. The period undergone is relevant but not determinative.”It underscored that when “weighed against the gravity of the crime, the threat perception, the appellant’s antecedents, and the nature of the trial court’s findings, this factor alone cannot warrant suspension.”In 2020, Sengar was sentenced to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment by a trial court in the case. The trial court said “no leniency” could be shown for killing a family’s “sole bread earner.” It also awarded a 10-year jail term to Sengar’s brother, Atul Singh Sengar, and five others for their role in the custodial killing of the rape survivor’s father.The father was arrested at the behest of Sengar under the Arms Act and died in custody on April 9, 2018, owing to police brutalities. Sengar kidnapped the minor and raped her in 2017. The former lawmaker’s sentence was suspended by HC on Dec 23, 2025, in the main rape case but the order was stayed by the Supreme Court on Dec 29, 2025.","Delhi high court refuses to suspend 10-year jail term handed to expelled bjp functionary kuldeep singh sengar for the custodial death of the unnao rape survivor’s father. “the offence committed is of grave magnitude and has a deep societal impact,” justice ravinder dudeja observed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126733020,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1009135,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

FIR In July 2023, Suspects Not Even Identified Yet







IMPHAL: A 20-year-old from the Kuki-Zo community, who became the unseen face of mob-fuelled sexual violence during the May 2023 ethnic rioting in Manipur, has died waiting for justice.Eighteen when she was abducted and allegedly ""handed over"" to members of an armed group, the woman carried physical and psychological injuries that never healed, culminating in her death on Jan 10, the Indigenous Tribal Leaders Forum said.The FIR, filed two-and-a-half years ago, is still pending at Porompat police station in Imphal East. None among her alleged attackers has been even identified.Kuki-Zo organisations, including Committee on Tribal Unity, held a candlelight vigil Saturday, demanding accountability for the woman's trauma through the 30-odd months she lived since the assault. She first reported the alleged crime to Kangpokpi police on July 21, 2023, two months after it occurred.This was after she fled the Imphal Valley amid spiralling unrest there. The FIR states that she was abducted on May 15 that year from near an ATM booth in Imphal's New Checkon. Some women from a group involved in the ethnic clashes allowed four armed men belonging to a valley-based outfit to take her to a hilltop, where three of them allegedly took turns sexually brutalising her before dumping her in a creek.The woman survived when an autorickshaw driver ferrying vegetables found her. The next day, she fled Imphal and sought treatment at a Kangpokpi hospital. She was referred to a hospital at Kohima in Nagaland and later to Guwahati in Assam.Despite months of medical care, the woman continued to suffer from uterine complications and deep psychological trauma, ITLF said. The organisation termed her death ""emblematic"" of the atrocities faced by the community during the ethnic violence.The Committee on Tribal Unity urged the Union govt to ensure justice was done to the young woman, saying punishing the perpetrators would ""uphold the spirit of the PM's Beti Bachao vision"".","20-year-old from kuki-zo community became the unseen face of mob-fuelled sexual violence.

"When winter burns: Uttarakhand to Kashmir, Himalayan forests are catching fire out of season",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-winter-burns-uttarakhand-to-kashmir-himalayan-forests-are-catching-fire-out-of-season/articleshow/126661834.cms,"‘Mountains where we’ve lived our lives don’t feel as pleasant anymore’

The pattern extends further north

But does dryness alone explain the scale or spread?

DEHRADUN/KULLU/SRINAGAR: For decades, forest fires in the Himalayas followed a predictable calendar. They started simmering in late spring and early summer, when rising temperatures, dry winds and accumulated leaf litter turned forests combustible. Winter, by contrast, was the season of snow, moisture and relative calm. That rhythm has been breaking for the past few years.This winter, forests across Uttarakhand - and increasingly Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir - have been burning with an intensity and frequency that forest officials and scientists say is no longer an anomaly, but indicative of a shifting ecological pattern. ""Forest fires are part of a natural cycle, but climate variability is compressing and intensifying that cycle,"" said Amit Kumar Verma, senior scientist at Dehradun's Forest Research Institute, who is involved in a five-year study to understand shifting forest fire regimes across the country.Data from Doon-based Forest Survey of India (FSI) shows that since the onset of the winter wildfire season on Nov 1, Uttarakhand has recorded the highest number of fire alerts in the country - 1,756 - surpassing states traditionally more forest fire-prone, such as Maharashtra (1,028), Karnataka (924), Madhya Pradesh (868) and Chhattisgarh (862).While officials emphasise that not every satellite alert translates into an active forest fire, the pattern itself is difficult to dismiss.December, typically a low-fire month, emerged as the most active in the state in nearly three years.Data from Doon-based Forest Survey of India (FSI) shows that since the onset of the winter wildfire season on Nov 1, Uttarakhand has recorded the highest number of fire alerts in the country — 1,756 — surpassing states traditionally more forest fire-prone, such as Maharashtra (1,028), Karnataka (924), Madhya Pradesh (868) and Chhattisgarh (862).While officials emphasise that not every satellite alert translates into an active forest fire, the pattern itself is difficult to dismiss.Dec, typically a low-fire month, emerged as the most active in the state in nearly three years. Forest officials attribute much of the spike to extreme dryness. “We have had a completely rainless December. Moisture levels in forest floors are very low,” a senior official said. Like Uttarakhand, Himachal, too, has not received any rainfall since the first week of October last year, and snowfall has been largely absent from major apple-growing belts such as Kullu, Mandi, Shimla and Chamba. This has led to fires sparking across the state’s forests -- maximum at Shimla forest circle (62), followed by Rampur (16), Mandi (8), the Great Himalayan National Park-Kullu (6), Chamba and Kullu (4 each), and Bilaspur and Wildlife (South) circle (2 each) as per data from the state forest department.Kashmir’s forests have been enduring a harsh, snow-deficient winter too. Fires have been reported across the Valley and the Pir Panjal range, including Uri, Bandipora, Nishat and Poonch. In Dec, a forest guard died while fighting a blaze in south Kashmir’s Anantnag district, and on Jan 12, a forest fire in Poonch triggered a series of landmine explosions along the Line of Control after flames spread into mined areas in Balakote and Mendhar sectors. “There is nearly a 40% snowfall deficit after three consecutive dry winters,” said Mudasir Mehmood, DFO Awantipora. “With no soil moisture, it’s no surprise that grass becomes highly flammable.”Officials point to stubble burning in farms close to forest fringes, biomass and solid waste burning, and in some cases, villagers setting fire to forest floors to encourage fresh grass growth for cattle. Anti-forest activities — including poaching and attempts to flush wildlife from cover — are also cited by forest and wildlife experts as possible reasons.According to former Uttarakhand head of forest force Jairaj, forest fires are rarely driven by a single cause. “In high-altitude areas with valuable wildlife like musk deer, poachers sometimes light fires to corner animals during winter when they are already vulnerable. Climate change adds another layer — everything is dry, and even a small spark can escalate into a big blaze,” he said.What is compounding the situation is that traditional forest management practices have eroded. The gradual decline of grazing and community-led clearing has allowed dry grass and leaf litter to accumulate on the forest floor, creating a potent mix that can erupt into a blaze if a carelessly-thrown beedi or half-lit match comes its way. “Earlier, villagers regularly cleared jungle grass. With migration and alternative livelihoods, that practice is fading,” an official said.On the ground, residents are already feeling the impact. In Jyotirmath (formerly Joshimath), 61-year-old Sarvani Devi has been watching, with a wary eye, smoke spiralling from the forest near her house for the past few days. “If these fires spread, everything will turn to ash. That is our biggest fear. Somehow, these mountains, where we have lived all our lives, don’t feel as pleasant anymore.”","Since the onset of the winter wildfire season on nov 1, uttarakhand has recorded the highest number of fire alerts in the country.

‘BJP Won By Betrayal’: Uddhav Thackeray’s First Reaction On Mumbai Civic Poll Results







MUMBAI: Striking a defiant note in the aftermath of the high-stakes civic elections, MNS chief Raj Thackeray on Friday acknowledged the party's below-expectation performance but urged his newly elected corporators to turn municipal houses into battlegrounds against what he described as the ""rule of money power"" and policies detrimental to Marathi interests.Addressing party workers and supporters, Thackeray congratulated elected corporators of both the MNS and Shiv Sena , underlining that the elections were fought in adverse circumstances.""This election was not easy. It was a battle between the power of wealth and power, and it was directed against the Shiv Sena,"" he said, crediting grassroots workers for holding their ground despite the odds.While conceding that the MNS did not secure the kind of mandate it had hoped for, Thackeray made it clear that electoral setbacks would not blunt the party's political edge. ""We are not the kind to get discouraged. Our elected corporators will bury the rulers there,"" he said, adding, that ""if they see anything happening against the Marathi people, they will definitely bring those rulers to book.""Political observers see Thackeray's remarks as a bid to reposition the MNS as a combative force within civic governance rather than merely a player measured by seat tallies.","Mns chief raj thackeray urges newly elected corporators to turn municipal houses into battlegrounds.

DMK or TVK? Decoding Congress's alliance dilemma ahead of Tamil Nadu assembly elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dmk-or-tvk-congresss-decision-dilemma-ahead-of-tamil-nadu-assembly-elections/articleshow/126678409.cms,"The Congress has been on the winning side in Tamil Nadu several times, but has not been a part of the DMK government. If the Congress dumps DMK and manages to join a winning combination, it may get a chance to be part of the state government.

The DMK has often been accused of being anti-Hindu and anti-north - with some of its leaders making remarks that often run into controversy. While it helps the DMK in Tamil Nadu, the Congress, being a national ally, is left facing the consequences of these remarks in other parts, where it has high electoral stakes.

For years, Congress was the only national party with a reasonable presence in Tamil Nadu. However, that is changing fast. The BJP is working aggressively to gain ground in the state. The Congress needs to take steps to prevent itself from being swept out of the state politics by the BJP as has happened in several other states.

The DMK which is fighting for a second consecutive term could face anti-incumbency. Several DMK leaders also face corruption charges. These will also impact the Congress adversely even though it is not part of the government and has no say in matters of policy or governance.

The emergence of Vijay’s TVK gives the Congress an option to explore political realignment in the state. The TVK, which is leaving no stone unturned for a debut victory, has already called the Congress a “natural ally.” Actor Vijay’s popularity and his massive rallies have already forced the existing players to take note of his political march.

The Congress alliance with the DMK is stable and time-tested. Congress has gained politically from this alliance winning seats in both assembly and Lok Sabha elections. The two parties have worked together for a long time ironing out differences. If Congress dumps the alliance, it may turn out to be a costly gamble.

The DMK has been a crucial and loyal India-bloc ally for the Congress. With the state sending 39 members to Lok Sabha, Congress has gained from the DMK’s numbers in its national politics. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the DMK won 22 seats.

The Congress lacks the kind of cadre support and organisational strength needed to pursue independent politics in Tamil Nadu. Its vote share in the state has been on the decline in assembly elections.

Vijay the actor may be very popular, but Vijay the politician remains an untested novice. Huge crowds in rallies may not translate into votes when Tamil Nadu goes to polls to elect a new assembly in some months. If Vijay fails, like Prashant Kishor did in Bihar, Congress will end up losing a stable long-term ally without any political gains. Since AIADMK is already tied up with the BJP, the Congress may be pushed to oblivion.

NEW DELHI: The Congress is finally in action mode in Tamil Nadu. After a weekend brainstorming with party chief Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi in the national capital, the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee has convened a crucial Executive Committee meeting tomorrow to focus on preparations for the upcoming 2026 Tamil Nadu assembly elections.But the important question is: Has the Congress finalised its direction in the state? Will the grand-old party continue with its long-term ally the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam ( DMK ), which has refused to share power if the alliance wins the upcoming assembly elections? Or will the Congress explore the possibility of a new coalition in the state by joining hands with actor-politician Vijay ’s TVK?The Congress-DMK alliance in Tamil Nadu faces one of its toughest challenges from within. According to reports, the Congress leadership has asked the state unit leaders to maintain alliance discipline and avoid confrontational political posturing against the long-standing and “trusted” ally. The directive on the importance of unity comes amid some very strong remarks made by a section of the state Congress after DMK rejected the idea of a coalition government.Congress MP Manickam Tagore was the first to float the idea of power sharing when he said that time had come to discuss sharing of power in the state with DMK.When the DMK said “no” to this, the Congress leader took potshots at the regional ally and also accused it of intolerance towards coalition partners.“We do not say ‘bye-bye’ to allies after elections,” Manickam Tagore said in a hard-hitting social media post. The Congress leader cited the example of United Democratic Front (UDF), the Congress-led coalition in Kerala, to school the DMK on “coalition dharma.” In a series of Pongal messages, Tagore contrasted what he described as the DMK’s “centralised mindset” with the inclusive and consultative UDF model practised in Kerala. “No betrayal after elections, no breaking alliances after counting votes. That is the UDF difference,” he said, describing it as “coalition dharma in action”.Tagore said Kerala UDF offers a hopeful template for coalition politics, where the Congress leads without monopolising authority. Power, he stressed, is shared rather than concentrated.The DMK is yet to react to this raised pitch by the Congress, which has till now played second fiddle to its regional ally. Even in 2006 when the DMK had fallen short of majority winning 96 seats, the Congress with 34 elected members supported DMK’s minority government without joining it.The Congress’s electoral fortunes in Tamil Nadu have been intertwined with the DMK since the two parties came together. Whenever the DMK has done well, the Congress has also gained, and vice versa.The grand-old party has seen a steady decline in its vote share in the state from 9.3% in 2011 to 4.27% in the 2021 assembly elections. So, has the time come for the Congress to rethink its Tamil Nadu strategy? Here are the pros and cons of the grand-old party considering a political realignment in the state.PROSCONSFor the Congress leadership, any decision on DMK alliance in Tamil Nadu will be tricky. While on the one hand, it will be tempted to experiment with Vijay’s TVK for greater political gains, on the other, it would be wary of its decision turning into a costly gamble.","The congress has been on the winning side in tamil nadu several times. If the congress dumps dmk and manages to join a winning combination, it may get a chance to be part of the state government. The emergence of vijay’s tvk gives the congress an option to explore political realignment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126689179,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-700440,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Individuals in the category who have not submitted their claims or objections must do so within 10 days.

Working closely with a qualified external partner, our teams have spent considerable time cataloguing and documenting recoverable and returnable items,” a spokesperson told news agency PTI.“The exercise began on January 5 and will continue till mid-February. Information has been shared with the families through email and a dedicated website, and once they confirm the details, the belongings will be handed over physically in a manner that honours their grief and privacy. Several families have already collected the items which belonged to their kin,” he added.For “associated” belongings, emails have been sent to the concerned relatives with photographs and details of each recovered item, offering three options: to decline possession, collect it in person from a facilitation centre in Ahmedabad, or have Air India send it via courier.For the remaining 14,000 items, a separate portal has been created. The kin can either collect these in person at Ahmedabad or have them sent by courier, according to their preference.The belongings on display include a toy airplane, a toy car, a wristwatch, plastic bangles, a sweater, a pair of shoes, a half-burnt page of a book containing the famous Gujarati prayer “Mangal Mandir Kholo,” handbags, and other items.On June 12 last year, Air India flight AI-171, a Boeing 787-8 en route to London Gatwick, crashed into a medical college hostel complex shortly after taking off from Ahmedabad’s Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport.

The larger picture



When results from Maharashtra's long-delayed civic polls came on January 16, it became clear that the Bhartiya Janata Party ( BJP ) has made it to the top once again. The BJP swept 1,425 of 2,869 seats across 29 municipal corporations, a strike rate of nearly 50%. In Mumbai's Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), a Shiv Sena citadel for 25 years, slipped out of regional control.Since 2014, the BJP's rise has not dismantled regional politics outright. Instead, it has steadily shrunk the space in which regional parties operate, limiting their ability to convert votes into seats, state power into national leverage and identity politics into a sustained election issue.Let's take a look at how that containment has unfolded, state by state.Recent civic polls in Maharashtra offer a clear snapshot of regional parties containment in action.In the January 2026 civic elections, the BJP emerged as the single largest party across major urban bodies. In Mumbai’s BMC, it won 89 of 227 wards on its own. With ally Eknath Shinde’s faction of the Shiv Sena adding another 29, the ruling Mahayuti crossed the majority mark. Uddhav Thackeray ’s Shiv Sena (UBT) was reduced to 65 seats, down from more than 130 in 2017.Across the state, the picture was bleaker for regional forces. In Pune Municipal Corporation, the BJP crossed 110 seats, while the combined strength of the two Pawars - Sharad and Ajit Pawar - remained in double digits.Pimpri-Chinchwad, another Nationalist Congress Party bastion, delivered 87 seats to the BJP.These civic polls were delayed for nearly nine years due to legal and administrative hurdles.The BJP framed its campaign around the idea of a ""triple-engine sarkaar"", led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Centre and Devendra Fadnavis at the state level. Welfare schemes such as 'Majhi Ladki Bahin' found traction among women voters, while youth backing was decisive: nearly 47% of voters aged 18–25 reportedly favoured the BJP.But the most decisive factor was political fragmentation.The 2022 Shiv Sena split turned Shinde into a BJP ally, hollowing out the party’s organisational spine. The 2023 NCP fracture left Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawar competing for the same shrinking base. Even Uddhav Thackeray’s tactical alliance with the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) split Marathi identity votes in dozens of wards, indirectly benefiting the BJP.In Bihar, the regional parties have not been eliminated, but absorbed and subordinated within a BJP-led political framework.In 2025 Bihar assembly elections, the NDA won over 200 of 243 seats, its most decisive victory in the state in decades. Within that, the BJP emerged as the single largest party, overtaking chief minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) in numerical strength for the first time.Seat data underlined the altered balance of power.The BJP secured 89 seats, while JD(U) followed with 85 seats. Smaller allies such as the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Hindustani Awam Morcha and Rashtriya Lok Morcha added to the NDA tally. In contrast, the opposition collapsed. The Rashtriya Janata Dal, which had won 75 seats in 2020, was reduced to roughly 25 seats, while the Congress slipped to single digits.For regional parties in Bihar, this was not merely a defeat. It was a reordering.Nitish Kumar retained the chief ministership, but the arithmetic left little ambiguity. Power within the alliance now flows from the BJP outward, not the other way around. JD(U), once the pivot of Bihar politics and a perennial kingmaker in Delhi, now operates within limits defined by its larger partner.The RJD’s trajectory is equally telling. Tejashwi Yadav's party got the highest vote share of 23% in the elections: BJP - 20.08%, JD(U) - 19.25%.Despite retaining a loyal base among Muslims and Yadavs, the vote share did not translate into seats.Welfare schemes, infrastructure expansion and caste-neutral messaging from the NDA fractured older social coalitions.Bihar results show a crucial feature of the BJP's containment strategy: regional parties are allowed to survive, but not to dominate.Containment here does not mean extinction.It means subordination — a shift from being the senior partner to alliance dependents in a political order anchored firmly by the BJP.In India’s most populous state, the BJP’s containment strategy has played out through electoral arithmetic.In 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP-led NDA won 64 of 80 seats. On the other hand, Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party , despite being opposition in the 2022 assembly with 111 of 403 seats, struggled to expand its footprint. The Bahujan Samaj Party, once a pivotal force, was reduced to near irrelevance, winning just one seat.Vote shares tell a revealing story. BJP got around 36% vote share in 2024, while Samajwadi part got near 29%.This gap was widened by welfare politics. Schemes such as PM Awas Yojana, free rations and direct benefit transfers helped the BJP get more votes.Construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya also helped consolidate Hindu votes across caste.The Trinamool Congress remains dominant in West Bengal, but the BJP is up for the challenge.In the 2021 assembly elections, TMC won 213 of 294 seats. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, it retained 29 of 42 seats, getting around 45% of vote share. The BJP, however, consolidated itself as the principal challenger, holding roughly 23% of the vote share.The trajectory matters. BJP’s vote share surged from 18% in 2019 to nearly 38% in the 2021 assembly polls, driven by defections, organisational expansion and polarised campaigning. While welfare schemes such as Lakshmir Bhandar helped TMC stabilise its base, urban Kolkata and tribal belts like Jangalmahal saw growing BJP penetration.Mamata Banerjee remains powerful within the state. But will she continue to enjoy this power for log? We will know in a few months as Bengal votes for its next assembly.The 2025 Delhi assembly elections marked a turning point.The BJP won 48 of 70 seats, ending a decade of rule by the Aam Aadmi Party and reclaiming the capital after nearly 27 years. AAP’s vote share remained competitive, but BJP’s organisational depth, candidate spread and campaign scale ensured superior seat conversion.For AAP, the loss was existential. Once projected as a governance-driven alternative with national ambitions, it now faces questions about relevance beyond Punjab. Delhi’s verdict showed that even a high-visibility regional model can be overwhelmed by a national party’s machinery.Odisha saw one of the sharpest collapses. In 2019, the Biju Janata Dal won 113 of 147 assembly seats. By 2024, BJP swept 20 of 21 Lok Sabha seats and won 78 assembly seats, ending Naveen Patnaik’s long rule. Leadership vacuum and BJP’s appropriation of Odia identity accelerated the fall.In Andhra Pradesh, the YSR Congress Party’s dominance evaporated in 2024, when a TDP-BJP-JSP alliance won 135 of 175 assembly seats, pushing YSRCP to the margins despite a significant residual vote share.Both states show how quickly regional dominance can collapse when organisational depth and narrative control shift.Tamil Nadu remains the clearest exception.In the 2021 assembly elections, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam won 133 of 234 seats. In 2024, the DMK-led alliance secured 22 of 39 Lok Sabha seats. BJP’s vote share remains in single digits.Strong linguistic identity, entrenched welfare politics and the legacy of Dravidian ideology have limited BJP’s expansion. Seat conversion for regional parties remains efficient, and internal splits have so far been avoided.Kerala’s alternating Left and Congress coalitions continue to resist national consolidation. BJP’s vote share hovers around 11–15%, with limited seat gains despite a strong cadre base.High political literacy, entrenched welfare systems and cohesive minority blocs have constrained BJP’s growth. Yet even here, regional dominance remains confined within state borders, offering little national leverage.Nationally, the BJP-led NDA governs 19 states and is currently at its highest-ever strength in atate assemblies. The BJP alone presently has 1654 MLAs across state assemblies.Regional parties together hold roughhly about 31% of MLAs.BJP's containment strategy is consistent:Urbanisation, aspirational voting and fatigue with dynastic feuds have amplified these effects.India's regional parties are not extinct. They still win elections and govern states. But the data since 2014 shows their power is increasingly bounded.Civic routs in Maharashtra, the fall of AAP in Delhi, and reversals in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh all point to the same conclusion: the pathway from state power to national influence has narrowed dramatically.As 2026 assembly elections approach in five states and UT, the challenge for regional parties is no longer survival alone. It is to reinvent in current political climate. Will Mamata Banerjee and MK Stalin be able to hold their grounds or will the BJP push their parties to the wall? We will know by mid-year.","Since 2014, the bjp's rise has not dismantled regional politics outright. Instead, it has steadily shrunk the space in which regional parties operate. This has limited their ability to convert votes into seats, state power into national leverage and identity politics into a sustained election issue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126682951,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1587217,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
