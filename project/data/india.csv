The double life of Odisha police constable Deepak Kumar Rout, 39, is under the scanner following his arrest for murder of his 25-year-old second wife, traffic constable Subhamitra Sahoo, who was found buried in a pit meant to pass off as a toilet.Subhamitra's body was exhumed in Keonjhar Wednesday, leading to arrest of her husband and two others, his relative Binod Bihari Bhuyan (28), and landowner Sambhunath Mohanta, who allegedly took Rs 5,000 to let Rout bury her on his plot. Mohanta hired a machine to dig the pit, misleading the operator that it was for toilet construction.The killing reopened old wounds. On Thursday, the family of Rout's first wife Aparna Priyadarshini, a revenue inspector, who died in a road crash in March 2022, lodged a complaint in Dhenkanal alleging she too was murdered. They claimed Rout tortured Aparna, coerced her into loans of over Rs 10 lakh, and later collected Rs 1 crore in insurance after her death. Subhamitra was also insured for Rs 1 crore. DCP Jagmohan Meena said Rout hatched the plan to murder Subhamitra on Aug 26 after rows over money with her, whom he had married in July.","Odisha police constable deepak kumar rout, 39, is under the scanner following his arrest for murder of his second wife.

Bombay HC nixes PIL against Maharashtra order to issue Kunbi caste certs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-nixes-pil-against-maharashtra-order-to-issue-kunbi-caste-certs/articleshow/123988465.cms,"Mumbai: Observing there is a need to discourage the trend of multiplicity of litigation, Bombay HC Thursday dismissed a PIL challenging Maharashtra govt's decision to issue Kunbi caste certificates to members of Maratha community. ""It is in the larger public interest that there should not be multiplicity of litigations, where different individuals file applications one after the other under the guise of public interest,"" HC said.A bench of CJ Shree Chandrashekhar and Justice Gautam Ankhad remarked that the petitioner, an advocate from SC community, was not an aggrieved party. The state advocate general Birendra Saraf submitted that over half a dozen petitions were already pending before various benches, challenging the same GR. Saraf said the GR doesn't pertain to SC certificates. ""It simply sets up a mechanism to facilitate an enquiry into whether a Maratha individual can prove Kunbi ancestry. It does not affect the SCs in any manner,"" he said. The PIL was originally intended to give a voice to the voiceless masses or sections of society, the HC orally observed and added, ""A writ petition, claiming to be a PIL involving a subject matter of this nature, is clearly not in the category of cases where the writ court should grant indulgence.

SC tells states to make rules for regn of Sikh marriages in 4 months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-tells-states-to-make-rules-for-regn-of-sikh-marriages-in-4-months/articleshow/123988343.cms,"NEW DELHI: Observing that ""in a secular republic, the State must not turn a citizen's faith into either a privilege or a handicap"", Supreme Court has pulled up states and UTs for not framing rules for registration of Sikh marriages (Anand Karaj) and directed them to do it within four months.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta ordered that till the states frame rules, the registration of Anand Karaj marriages should be done without discrimination under the prevailing marriage registration framework.The Anand Marriage Act was enacted to recognise the validity of marriages performed by the Sikh ceremony of Anand Karaj. By the Amendment of 2012, Parliament inserted Section 6 of the Act, casting a duty on respective state govts to make rules to facilitate registration of such marriages, maintain a marriage register, and provide certified extracts, while clarifying that failure to register it would not affect the validity of an Anand marriage. As many states and UTs failed to implement the law in more than a decade, the apex court intervened and passed directives.""The fidelity of a constitutional promise is measured not only by the rights it proclaims, but by the institutions that make those rights usable. In a secular republic, the State must not turn a citizen's faith into either a privilege or a handicap. When the law recognises Anand Karaj as a valid form of marriage yet leaves no machinery to register it, the promise is only half kept.What remains is to ensure that the route from rites to record is open, uniform and fair,"" SC said. The Supreme Court said Section 6 of the Act discloses a complete legislative scheme and the provision, intended as an imperative, identifies the facilitative purpose of registration.""It requires the keeping of a public register with certified extracts, provides for laying of rules before the state legislature, and removes the burden of duplicative registration once an entry is made under the Act.","The anand marriage act was enacted to recognise the validity of marriages performed by the sikh ceremony of anand karaj.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday presented evidence on alleged ""vote chori"", accusing Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar of shielding those he claimed had ""destroyed Indian democracy. ""Speaking at a press conference at the Indira Bhawan Auditorium, the leader of opposition cited Aland constituency in Karnataka, where he alleged that a ""targeted"" attempt was made to delete 6,018 votes.He claimed that 6,018 applications were filed impersonating voters and this filing was done automatically using mobile numbers from outside Karnataka.Rahul Gandhi also made a claim about CEC Gyanesh Kumar.

He urged, ""Gyanesh Kumar jido your job, and you have taken an oath. Give the details to the Karnataka CID.""This press conference came 40 days after Rahul raised questions on the electoral outcome of Bangalore Central Lok Sabha seat, claiming that there was ""chori"" (stealing) of one lakh votes in Mahadevapura assembly seat during the 2024 polls. He had then claimed that the Election Commission was colluding with the BJP, which he called a ""crime"" against the Constitution.Speaking about the so-called ""hydrogen bomb"" of revelations, Rahul Gandhi said, ""We will present the hydrogen bomb.""He added, ""I told my team I would not step on stage without 100% proof.""""We will take two to three months to finish these presentations, and there will be no doubt that elections are being stolen across states in India,"" he said.Earlier, addressing the concluding event of his Voter Adhikar Yatra on September 1, Gandhi had said his party will soon come out with a ""hydrogen bomb"" of revelations about ""vote chori"" and after that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not be able to show his face to the country.Last month, Gandhi, citing data from the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, had claimed that over one lakh votes were ""stolen"" through manipulation in Mahadevapura assembly segment in Karnataka, and asserted that ""vote chori"" is an ""atom bomb on our democracy"".","Congress leader rahul gandhi presented evidence on alleged ""vote chori"" he accused chief election commissioner (cec) gyanesh kumar of shielding those he claimed had ""destroyed indian democracy"" gandhi claimed that 6,018 applications were filed impersonating voters and this filing was done automatically using mobile numbers from outside karnataka.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123966102,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-611994,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

LUDHIANA: In a village on the outskirts of Ludhiana, a crime was uncovered that was as grisly as it was puzzling — a 71-year-old NRI travelled from the US to marry her sunset love, only to allegedly be bludgeoned to death by a man hired by her would-be groom, a 75-year-old settled in the UK.Rupinder Kaur was allegedly killed by the very man whose roof she shared in Kila Raipur village (15km from Ludhiana). Her body was burnt and the remains flung into a nullah, say police.What gave away the gruesome crime was a fresh coat of paint and new floor tiles at the home of the alleged killer, Sukhjit Singh alias Sonu, a typist in Ludhiana district court.Read also: ‘Beaten to death with baseball bat’: Inside the grisly murder of 71-year-old NRI Rupinder Kaur in Ludhiana The case registered by Ludhiana Police names him and UK-based Charanjit Singh. Sukhjit is in custody and charged with murder. Charanjit is in the UK. It's not known if police have contacted him.Police said Charanjit had backed out of the marriage and got Rupinder killed because she wouldn't take no for an answer and had threatened to implicate him in a case if he refused. Police sources told TOI the motive was still a grey area.Sukhjit filed a complaint on Aug 18, reporting Rupinder missing. He said she had given her power of attorney to deal with her civil/criminal cases about six months ago, and that she arrived in India in early-July.Sukhjit claimed Rupinder lived in his house for about 10 days and left for Delhi on July 18, saying she would fly to Canada to attend a wedding. However, he claimed he hadn't been able to contact her since then.Deputy commissioner (city, rural) Rupinder Singh said, ""Police found the NRI woman was murdered by Sukhjit at the behest of her NRI friend, Charanjit Singh. Probe revealed she had relations with Charanjit, and he initially wanted to marry her. Rupinder faced an FIR at NRI police station in a cheating case and was declared a proclaimed offender. Charanjit introduced her to Sukhjit for court-related work.""""Rupinder would pay Sukhjit via bank transactions. It is yet to be checked how much and for what purpose,"" said the officer. Police say Rupinder and Charanjit met often in India and abroad, and they had their pictures to prove it.Sukhjit claimed Charanjit told him Rupinder threatened to implicate Charanjit in a rape case and Sukhjit in a cheating case. ""Charanjit lured Sukhjit by offering him Rs 50 lakh to kill Rupinder. He also offered to call Sukhjit to UK. When Sukhjit agreed to execute the murder, Charanjit asked Rupinder to travel to India, promising to marry her there,"" added the officer.On July 12, Sukhjit beat Rupinder to death with a baseball bat. ADCP-II Karanveer Singh said, ""The accused got a large amount of coal and started a fire. He put the woman's body on it to burn it, which took two-three days. He put the skeletal remains in sacks and dumped them in a water channel. He hammered her mobile to pieces and dumped it too. Police have recovered some of the remains and the hammer.""Asked how police cracked the case, a senior officer said since Sukhjit used coal inside his house, the room got damaged. Some labourers from the village were hired to repair it. ""The village was already abuzz about the missing NRI woman, and here was a soot-blackened room. It made people suspect him.

BJP’s response: What Amit Shah & Anurag Thakur said



What Election Commission said



Rahul’s rebuttal to ECI’s ‘fact-check’



What Karnataka election Commission said



NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday intensified his confrontation with the Election Commission of India (ECI), accusing Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar of shielding “vote chors” and blocking investigations into alleged large-scale voter deletions. At a press conference in the capital, the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha presented what he described as “100% proof” of voter manipulation in Karnataka’s Aland assembly constituency. The allegation has triggered a political storm, drawing sharp rebuttals from the BJP and the poll body itself.At his press briefing, Rahul Gandhi claimed that a systematic effort was underway to delete opposition voters across India. He alleged that impersonators used a centralised software system to file deletion applications in bulk. Displaying data from Karnataka’s Aland constituency, he said that over 6,018 votes were targeted in 2023.“In Aland, Karnataka, 6,018 votes, somebody tried to delete these votes. We do not know the total number of votes deleted in the 2023 elections, but somebody got caught. It was caught, like most crimes, by coincidence,” he said.Also read | 'Mobiles, software used': Rahul Gandhi explains how Karnataka's Aland saw massive voter deletions; CEC rejects claim Rahul explained that the alleged fraud came to light when a Booth Level Officer (BLO) noticed her uncle’s name missing from the rolls. Upon inquiry, she found that her neighbour’s phone number had been used to file the deletion. The neighbour, however, denied any involvement. “So neither the neighbour nor the person whose vote was deleted knew. Some other force hijacked the process and deleted the vote. As luck would have it, it got caught,” he said.The Congress leader further alleged that mobile numbers from outside Karnataka were used to impersonate voters in Aland. “The filing was done using software, mobile numbers outside Karnataka were used to delete numbers in Aland and it was done targeting Congress voters,” he charged.Rahul added that the targeted deletions primarily affected Dalits, OBCs, Adivasis, minorities, and other communities traditionally supporting opposition parties. “In election after election, someone, some group of people, have been systematically targeting voters for deletions across India. Different communities, mainly those who are voting for the opposition, Dalits, OBCs, Adivasis, minorities, are specifically targeted,” he said.He framed the issue as a direct threat to India’s democracy. “I am going to show the youth, the people, proof that is black and white, absolutely clear that Chief Election Commissioner of India is protecting people who have destroyed Indian democracy. I will also show you the methods by which votes are added, deleted and show you how it is done,” Rahul declared.The leader of opposition reiterated that his claims were backed by evidence. “We had heard this many times, and now we found 100 per cent proof of it. I am not going to say anything on this stage that is not backed up by 100 per cent proof. I am somebody who loves my country, the Constitution, and the democratic process, and I am protecting that process.”This was not Rahul Gandhi’s first such allegation. On August 7, he had accused the BJP of rigging voter rolls in Karnataka’s Mahadevapura constituency. Citing a party review, he claimed over one lakh bogus entries were detected, including tens of thousands with fake addresses and duplicate registrations. According to him, BJP’s 32,707-vote win in Bangalore Central was aided by “1,00,250 bogus votes” that fell into five categories—11,965 duplicate entries, 40,009 with fake or invalid addresses, 10,452 bulk voters at common addresses, 4,132 with invalid photos, and 33,692 cases of misuse of Form 6 for first-time voters.Rahul Gandhi’s allegations sparked immediate counter-attacks from BJP leaders, who dismissed his press conference as theatrics.Union home minister Amit Shah, while addressing BJP workers in Bihar’s Rohtas district, accused Rahul of spreading lies. “They (Congress) spread a false narrative every time. Rahul Gandhi did a Yatra… The topic of his yatra was not vote theft. The topic was not good education, employment, electricity, roads… The topic of the tour was saving the infiltrators who have come from Bangladesh. Have any of you lost their votes? This was Rahul Gandhi’s ‘Ghuspaithiya Bachao Yatra’,” Shah said.Also read | 'Spreading false narrative': Amit Shah slams Rahul Gandhi’s ‘vote theft’ charge; terms Congress leader's rally as 'Ghuspaithiya Bachao Yatra' He added that the Congress wanted infiltrators to enjoy the same rights as citizens. “Should infiltrators have the right to vote or free rations? Should infiltrators get jobs, houses, treatment up to 5 lakh rupees? Instead of our youth, this Rahul Baba and company are giving jobs to vote bank infiltrators,” he charged.BJP MP Anurag Thakur went a step further, suggesting that if there was “vote chori” in Aland, then Congress itself had benefitted. “According to the records, it was the Congress candidate from the Aland assembly constituency who had won. So, did Congress win by stealing votes?” Thakur asked.He mocked Rahul Gandhi for “dropping a hydrogen bomb on himself.” “Rahul Gandhi himself admitted in his press conference that he is not here to save democracy. If not to save it, then is his goal to destroy it? By taking help from toolkits, he constantly questions and undermines our constitutional institutions,” Thakur said.Thakur also attributed Rahul’s accusations to his “frustration” after multiple defeats. “The Congress has lost approximately 90 elections under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi. His frustration is increasing day by day. He has made politics of allegations his ornament. It has become a habit of Rahul Gandhi to make incorrect and baseless allegations. Seeking apology and being reprimanded by courts have become a routine of Rahul Gandhi,” Thakur said.BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya echoed the attack, highlighting that Congress’s own candidate B.R. Patil had won Aland in 2023. “Rahul Gandhi alleges deletion of votes in Karnataka’s Aland, in the run up to 2023 Assembly election. Fun fact: Aland AC was won by Subhash Guttedar of the BJP in 2018 and B.R. Patil (INC) in 2023. So, Congress candidate is the beneficiary of so called ‘Vote Chori’? Well done!” Malviya wrote.Read | 'Did Congress win in Aland by vote chori?' BJP says Rahul 'dropped H-bomb on self'; calls presser 'phuljhari' The Election Commission strongly rebutted Rahul Gandhi’s claims, calling them “incorrect and baseless.”In a formal statement, the poll body clarified, “No deletion of any vote can be done online by any member of the public, as conceived by Rahul Gandhi. No deletion can take place without giving an opportunity of being heard to the affected person.”Read | 'No deletion can be done online': EC dismisses Rahul Gandhi's Aland vote-chori charge; calls it 'baseless' The EC acknowledged that in 2023, there had been “certain unsuccessful attempts” to delete electors in Aland. It said an FIR had been filed by the Commission itself to probe the matter. “In 2023, certain unsuccessful attempts were made for deletion of electors in Aland AC and an FIR was filed by the authority of ECI itself to investigate the matter,” it said.The Commission also pointed out the electoral record of Aland, noting that BJP’s Subhash Guttedar won in 2018, while Congress’s B.R. Patil won in 2023. The EC suggested that Rahul’s claim of mass deletions did not align with the eventual outcome of the polls.Hours after the Election Commission’s clarification, Rahul Gandhi struck back, accusing CEC Gyanesh Kumar of blocking investigations. He alleged that despite multiple requests from Karnataka’s CID, crucial evidence was being withheld.“After our Aland candidate exposed the fraud, the local EC official filed an FIR, but the CID investigation has been BLOCKED by CEC. The Karnataka CID has written 18 letters in 18 months requesting all incriminating evidence—BLOCKED by CEC.

It insisted that deletions could not occur online and only after due process, and reminded that an FIR was already lodged to probe the incident.The latest clash adds another chapter to Rahul Gandhi’s prolonged standoff with the Election Commission. While Congress insists that the BJP is using institutional mechanisms to tilt the playing field, the ruling party maintains that Rahul’s claims are excuses for his electoral setbacks.The Karnataka Election Commission in a post on X said that an FIR was registered on February 21, 2023, over a large number of suspicious voter deletion applications submitted online in Kalaburagi’s Aland constituency.According to the commission, the Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) of 46-Aland received 6,018 applications in Form 7 through apps like NVSP, VHA, and GARUDA in December 2022. “Only 24 applications were found to be genuine and another 5,994 were found to be incorrect. Accordingly, 24 applications were accepted and 5,994 incorrect applications were rejected and not deleted,” the post said.Based on the inquiry by Booth Level Officers, the ERO lodged an FIR (No.26/2023) at Aland Police Station on February 21, 2023. The commission further said that on September 6, 2023, all available details were shared with the Superintendent of Police, Kalaburagi, to aid the investigation. These included objector details, EPIC numbers, mobile numbers used for login, IP addresses, software application mediums, and timestamps of submissions.The CEO, Karnataka, also held meetings with the investigating officer and cyber security experts to review progress and assured that the office continues to provide all required documents and assistance to the police.","Rahul gandhi accuses chief election commissioner gyanesh kumar of shielding ‘vote chors’ and blocking investigations into alleged large-scale voter deletions.

NEW DELHI: A video from Amritsar is going viral on social media, where a foreign tourist confronted a local man for asking his wife’s phone number without her consent. The woman said the man approached them and directly requested her contact details, which she found intrusive and inappropriate.In the video, the tourist questions the man, saying, “Why are you asking for her phone number? What you did is very strange. You are very strange. You approach a random female by herself and ask for her phone number within two seconds; that's very strange. Yeah, you shouldn't do that again, ok. You are a bit crazy.”The man, who identified himself as a student, tried to ease the tension by referring to the woman as “sister” before walking away abruptly.(The TOI couldn't independently verify the authenticity of this video.)The video has attracted widespread attention, with many social media users expressing frustration over such behavior and its impact on the city and country’s reputation, known for its cultural heritage and hospitality.One user shared, “I am not surprised, last year I went on a road trip with my then gf and people wouldn't stop asking her for photos, this was when I was with her! If she were alone, I could only assume how much worse it would have been.A couple of them even asked me to get them to be 'friends' with her.”Another commented, “I just went through a similar experience with a friend who recently visited India. Morons would walk up to her and ask her for a selfie, even the women! I would then have to rudely shoo them away. I had to explain to her that it's perfectly normal to just ignore people. Incidents like these just tarnish the image of the nation!”A third user criticized the man’s attempt to deflect responsibility, stating, “So after harassing an unknown person, you can just get away by saying 'sister'?”One woman questioned the recurring pattern, saying, “Why are Indian Men like this! In Amritsar an Indian man was caught asking for the phone number of ‘Gori Mam’. And what is this πJeet behaviour in the end.”Similar reports have surfaced from other parts of India, including an incident involving a Dutch woman who was harassed on a train traveling from Delhi to Agra.These incidents have reignited conversations about respecting women in public spaces and the need for greater awareness and sensitivity.","A video from amritsar is going viral on social media, where a foreign tourist confronts a local man for asking his wife’s phone number.

Why Kerala?

How Kerala Is Responding

Lessons For The World

On Sept 1, two patients — a threemonth-old baby and a 52-year-old woman — died within hours of each other at Kozhikode Govt Medical College. Doctors confirmed that both were being treated for primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), an infection caused by the free-living parasite Naegleria fowleri.By mid-Sept, the toll had risen to 19, with 69 suspected or confirmed cases across Kerala. Victims ranged from infants to middle-aged adults. The scale is extraordinary: globally, researchers have identified only 488 documented infections since 1962.PAM is one of the deadliest infections known to science. The parasite lives in warm, stagnant freshwater — ponds, lakes, unchlorinated swimming pools, poorly maintained tanks — and can infect people only when contaminated water is forced up the nose. From there, it travels along the olfactory nerve, burrows into the brain and begins dissolving tissue, unleashing catastrophic inflammation.Symptoms can begin in one to 12 days (typically 3-7 days): fever, headache, nausea and vomiting. Within days, they give way to stiff neck, confusion, seizures, hallucinations and coma.Across six decades, fewer than 20 survivors are documented globally, most with lasting neurological damage.The fatality rate is 97%.There is no vaccine or proven cure. Drugs such as Amphotericin B, Azoles, or Miltefosine are used in combination, sometimes with induced hypothermia, but success is rare. Crucially, PAM does not spread person to person and is not caused by drinking contaminated water; infection occurs via the noseWorldwide, PAM tends to appear as sporadic, one-off cases, usually tied to a single contaminated reservoir or swimming pool. Kerala’s outbreak is different. Cases have surfaced across Thiruvananthapuram, Kozhikode, Thrissur and Malappuram, with no single identified source.The state’s position as a public health bellwether makes the outbreak more unsettling. Kerala has often been the first to detect emerging threats: India’s first Nipah outbreak in 2018, its early Covid-19 cases in 2020 (detected in returning medical students from Wuhan), and Zika virus in 2021. The arrival of a rare, near-uniformly fatal amoeba on this list has alarmed both doctors and the public.“Eight people died in 15 days. What is the protocol? What are people supposed to do? Even a baby was infected — was that child in a swimming pool?” Opposition leader V D Satheesan asked in the state assembly this month.Protests have broken out in several districts, with residents demanding that wells and public taps be tested. Doctors caution that Kerala’s higher numbers also reflect better detection. “The symptoms — headache, fever and vomiting — are similar to bacterial and viral brain infections. If you don’t suspect amoeba, you’ll miss it completely,” said Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, convener of the Indian Medical Association’s research cell.Amid mounting panic, Kerala has launched ‘Jalamanu Jeevan (Water is Life)’, a statewide chlorination drive covering wells, pools, etc. Schools have been told to disinfect storage units regularly, while panchayats and municipalities are checking public taps and wells.Hospitals, particularly in Kozhikode, Thrissur and Malappuram, are on high alert. Doctors have been instructed to treat any meningitis-like illness with a history of water exposure as potential PAM. Rapid-response teams have been sent to test community water sources, though no contaminated reservoir has been found yet.Drugs, including Miltefosine, have been stocked. But officials concede that treatment rarely saves lives. Survivors worldwide are exceptional, often treated with a cocktail of antifungals, antibiotics and cooling therapies. That is why prevention — keeping contaminated water out of the nose — remains the focus.A 2025 review in the Journal of Infection and Public Health, which analysed 488 cases across 39 countries since the disease was first described, shows how there is little room for error — and what others can learn as climate change reshapes risk. The parasite is not the same everywhere: N. fowleri has multiple genetic strains; genotypes II and III predominate in Asia, North America and Europe.Clean water is the strongest defence: Free chlorine ≥ 2.0 mg/L in storage tanks/ pools can eliminate the amoeba; countries like Australia monitor disinfection as a routine public health practice.Surveillance changes the numbers: Strong labs and routine testing mean more detection (not necessarily more disease). Country tallies include India (26), Mexico (33), Czech Republic (17), New Zealand (9), Nigeria (4), Venezuela (7).Everyday habits can raise or reduce risk: In Pakistan, first cases were reported in Karachi in 2008; >140 cases have since been documented. Many were linked to nasal rinsing during ablution or showering, not swimming. A similar ablution-linked case has also been confirmed in the US.","Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (pam) is one of the deadliest infections known to science.

Over a month after his ""vote chori"" allegation about Mahadevapura, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi claimed Thursday that fraudulent voter additions and deletions are being done on a mass scale across states by impersonating voters in booths that favour Congress.He alleged the operation is being run through a centralised system, and applications are being filled through a software.

As the Karnataka CID is probing the case, Rahul accused Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar of protecting those ""who are murdering democracy"" by not giving information - destination IP from where the forms were filled, device destination ports from where these applications were filed and OTP trails - despite CID asking EC 18 times. He demanded that Kumar provide the details sought in a week's time.He also cited the example of the Rajoura assembly constituency in Maharashtra where 6,850 ""voter addition"" were attempted fraudulently using the same modus operandi as Aland.At a press conference titled ""Vote Chori Factory: The Aland Files"", Rahul showed purported applications for fraudulent voter deletion, with examples of Godabai, Nagraj and Suryakant, who were said to have filed applications for deletion of some voters.They denied ever doing so.Drawing a pattern, he said voter deletion was carried with phones from outside the state, and in the name of the voter marked first in the list in a booth.Amid heightened anticipation, Rahul said the vote deletion expose on Thursday was not the ""hydrogen bomb"" of ""vote chori"" that he had earlier said he would drop, but mentioned that the ""H-bomb"" would come soon. He said by the time Congress ends the presentations on 'vote chori"" in two to three months, the country would be convinced that votes are being stolen in state after state.Rahul said his job is to participate in democracy and not to protect it, but he is having to do so because other institutions are not discharging their duty. He urged ""the legal system"" to look into the details.""EC is not giving these details because it will lead us to where the operation is being done from.
