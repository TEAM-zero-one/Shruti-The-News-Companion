PM Modi Highlights Legal Reforms, Stresses Need for Law in Local Languages

NEW DELHI: PM Modi on Saturday said that ease of getting justice or universal accessibility to the justice delivery system plays a significant role in optimising ease of doing business and ease of living of citizens and that use of technology with a pro-people focus can serve as a force multiplier in this process.Addressing a gathering of constitutional court judges and lawyers at Supreme Court Annexe on Legal Services Day, Modi said that in the last 11 years the govt has focussed on ease of doing business by removing over 40,000 compliances, doing away with 3,400 legal provisions and repealing over 1,500 archaic laws, coupled with revisiting the archaic penal laws.""Ease of doing business and ease of living is possible only when ease of justice is ensured,"" he said, adding that in the last three decades National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) has played a vital role in linking commoners to the justice delivery system.Referring to speeches of CJI B R Gavai and CJI-designate Surya Kant on NALSA's efforts to prevent and settle lakhs of disputes through mediation in last three years, the PM said 'community mediation' is an ancient Indian practice that creates harmony and reduces litigation. Highlighting the importance of technology, Modi said, ""Technology can be disruptive. But with pro-people focus, it can be a democratic force."" For instance, UPI has revolutionised digital payments. ""Villages are being linked with optical fibres. One lakh mobile towers are being erected.""Legal professionals, judges and judicial officers must come together to chalk out a plan of action to make the justice delivery system advanced and accessible so that it is in sync with the goal of a developed India by 2047, he said, adding govt has sanctioned over Rs 7,000 crore for the judiciary's technological upgrade. The marginalised will not get justice until they are made aware of their rights. HCs and district courts must follow SC initiative to translate judgments into 18 different languages.""The language of justice must be understood by the litigants. Only then will there be increased compliance and less litigation,"" Modi said.CJI Gavai said NALSA has given rise to hope among the hopeless, marginalised and exploited class of citizens that someone will stand up for them somewhere for protection of their rights.""The system should not be reactive but proactive to prevent abuse of rights,"" he said. NALSA executive chairman and CJI-designate Kant said, ""The true measure of a justice system is not how swiftly it decides complex cases, but how deeply it touches the lives of ordinary citizens.""While echoing the importance given by PM to the role of technology, Justice Kant said, ""Technology does offer real opportunities like online conciliations and digital complaint portals, but technology alone will not suffice. It must be guided by local knowledge, linguistic accessibility and human empathy.""","Pm modi flagged off four vande bharat express trains from varanasi.

"Many still sitting on old note stashes, hoping for exchange",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gang-cheats-traders-sitting-on-old-notes/articleshow/125195600.cms,".

GHAZIABAD: Nine years after demonetisation, crores of invalidated Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes remain stashed with people, sustaining a grey market large enough for organised fraud. This was evident from the arrest of eight members of a gang over the last two weeks.The men were allegedly behind a multi-level racket that trapped clients, mainly traders and middlemen still hoarding invalid notes, via social media sites by promising discreet conversion of demonetised currency in exchange for hefty commissions.Investigation revealed that no currency was ever exchanged, and the gang simply collected bundles of demonetised currency and their advance fees before vanishing. Police have so far recovered demonetised notes worth Rs 3.9 crore from their stash.""Most victims never approached police because their own transaction was illegal,"" Trans-Hindon DCP Nimish Patil said. ""The fraud operated through a structured, three-tier chain. The first tier, which included the recently arrested SK alias Sharik and Abhinav alias Rahul Buddhi Raja, handled negotiations with victims and offered assurances of converting the notes at 25% of face value.The second comprised collectors who sourced demonetised currency directly from clients, and the third consisted of couriers who transported the notes to designated handover points. ""Police said the gang used WhatsApp, Telegram and encrypted calling apps to connect with potential clients. Conversations were coded, identities were masked, and SIM cards were changed frequently to avoid tracking. Abhinav, identified as the mastermind, coordinated activities across the chain and handled communications between collectors and couriers.In two rounds of arrests-first on Oct 31 and then on Nov 6 night-cops also nabbed Fakhruddin, Nasruddin, Shubham Chaudhary, Arun Kashyap, Mahesh Prasad and Jitendra Kumar.An FIR has been registered under BNS sections 318(2) (cheating), 62 (punishment for attempting to commit offences), 61(2) (criminal conspiracy) and 3/5 (common intention) and 5/7 of the Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of Liabilities) Act, 2017.Police are now examining the digital trails and financial links between the accused and their clients. Investigators say two to three other suspects named in the FIR are yet to be traced. For now, officers are expanding their focus to traders and middlemen who approached the gang, the very people who kept this underground market alive.""Victims rarely report these cases because they fear legal consequences. That secrecy is what the gang exploited for years,"" the DCP said.","Gang used whatsapp, telegram and encrypted calling apps to connect with potential clients.

PFI properties worth Rs 67 crore attached,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pfi-properties-worth-rs-67-crore-attached/articleshow/125195589.cms,".

NEW DELHI: In an attempt to seal the finances of banned Popular Front of India (PFI), the ED on November 6 attached properties worth Rs 67 crore of various trusts associated with the outfit and its political front, the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI). The attached properties are mostly located across Kerala. The total value of properties attached in the case so far is Rs 129 crore.The top brass of PFI is being investigated by NIA and ED for its role in sponsoring terror activities, particularly after it was found operating a terror training camp in Kerala's Narath, for which a special NIA court convicted 21 of its activists in 2016.""The history of origin of PFI can be traced back to the ban of Jamaat-e-Islami after demolition of Babri Masjid... At that time, properties of Jamaat-e-Islami were sealed under UA(P)A. Taking inspiration from these developments, PFI members who were part of National Development Front at that time, formed various trusts across Kerala and registered various properties owned and controlled by PFI under them,"" ED said.ED has arrested 28 top members of PFI so far during its money laundering investigation.A money trail revealed the outfit was engaged in collection of huge funds in India and in Gulf countries.The overseas funding was channeled through hawala and deposited in cash in various bank accounts of the outfit and associated entities.""The proceeds were used to carry out terrorist activities in India to achieve the goal of forming an 'Islamic Nation of India', jeopardising our secular fabric and disrupting the unity and integrity of the nation,"" the ED said, while releasing details of fresh attachments worth Rs 67 crore.",Ed has arrested 28 top members of pfi so far during its money laundering investigation.

JNU Clash: Student Union President Among 28 Detained, 6 Cops Injured During Protest Against ABVP





NEW DELHI: In a decisive victory, the Left Unity panel swept all four central posts in the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) elections for 2025-26 on Thursday, with Aditi Mishra of AISA becoming the university's first woman president since Aishe Ghosh in 2019. The results mark a strong comeback for the Left, which had lost one post to ABVP in the delayed 2024-25 polls this April.Mishra, a PhD student from Centre for Comparative Politics and Political Theory, secured 1,937 votes, defeating ABVP's Vikas Patel, who polled 1,488 votes. The margin of 449 votes is up from 272 recorded in the April poll.The presidential candidate of Progressive Students' Association (PSA), Shinde Vijayalaxmi Vyankat Rao, who gained traction among voters with her fiery presidential speech targeting both left and right politics on the campus, took away 1,276 votes while NSUI trailed with 419 votes.In the vice-presidential race, Left's K Gopika Babu from SFI registered the highest tally across all posts, winning by a massive margin of 1,314, up from 34 in the April poll. She secured 3,101 votes while ABVP's Tanya Kumari got 1,787 and NSUI's Shaikh Shahnawaz Alam 370.For the post of general secretary, Left's Sunil Yadav from DSF won by 104 votes, a little dip from April's 114, polling 2,005 votes against ABVP's Rajeshwar Kant Dubey's 1,901.The joint secretary's post was also clinched by Left, with Danish Ali securing 2,083 votes and defeating ABVP's Anuj Damra (1,797) by a margin of 286 votes. In the previous poll, ABVP had bagged this post with a margin of 45.This year's election saw 20 candidates in the fray for the four central panel posts, including six woman candidates, reflecting an increase in women's participation in the campus politics.During the early rounds of counting, when about 4,300 votes were tallied, ABVP was leading on two seats — general secretary and joint secretary. However, once votes from School of Social Sciences and School of Languages were opened, Left secured the lead on all posts. Both these centres have historically voted overwhelmingly for Left candidates.The day-long counting unfolded amid high-decibel sloganeering, drum beats and bursts of celebration as each round was declared. Late at night, tensions briefly flared when a group of students carrying Palestine flags clashed with ABVP supporters. Students alleged that ABVP members tore a flag while ABVP denied the charge, claiming the group had raised anti-govt slogans.Observers say the results reaffirm the united Left's dominance on the campus. The outcome also signals that while new entrants like PSA have injected energy into the campus discourse, the traditional Left remains the primary force shaping student politics at JNU, they add.","Left sweeps jnusu polls, first woman prez since 2019.

The city woke up to a chilly Saturday covered in a blanket of smog on Saturday as the air quality deteriorated to 'very poor' levels, with several areas slipping into the 'severe' category and many others on the verge. It was also Delhi's lowest minimum temperature for the month so far at 11C, three notches below normal. The capital's overall AQI stood at 337 at 9am, rising to 343 by noon. By 4pm, it settled at 361 - among the worst readings this season - and was 380 by 8pm. So far this season, the worst average AQI the city recorded was 371 on October 31.Residents grappled with burning eyes, sore throats, and itchy noses amid a thick, choking haze. By late afternoon, more areas had entered the severe category, including Nehru Nagar, Vivek Vihar, Wazirpur, Bawana and Burari. The air quality is very likely to stay in the very poor category till November 11.However, Delhi Pollution Control Committee said the city's air quality this Nov has, so far, remained better than the corresponding period last year. Officials said that for six out of seven days, the AQI was lower than last year's readings, adding that unlike last year, when emergency restrictions under Grap 3 were invoked on Nov 13, this year the govt has initiated mitigation steps much earlier.Grap 3 is yet to be implemented this year as CAQM officials state it will only kick in once the AQI turns 400 or worse.Residents have been urged to avoid burning biomass, waste, or wood, especially as temperatures fall and such practices become common for heating. Large housing societies have been advised to replace coal or wood-fired heaters for security guards with electric ones. Construction sites have been asked to ensure anti-smog guns are installed and operational, particularly at projects above five floors, till at least Nov 29. DPCC also said that staggered office timings should continue. CM Rekha Gupta announced that the govt will soon extend Ujjwala benefits to slums, enabling them to switch to clean cooking fuel. The govt has also instructed departments to step up road cleaning, dust suppression and pavement repair.Itchy eyes, sore throat, choked lungs: Air quality takes a toll on residents | page 4Noida: Smog continued to choke Noida on Saturday, with several neighbourhoods waking up to a burning sensation in the eyes, sore throats, and increasing breathing discomfort. As the Air Quality Index (AQI) remained in 'very poor' category, residents said they have stopped early-morning walks, jogging, cycling, and other outdoor activities because of the thick layer of haze that blankets the skyline.CPCB data showed Noida's overall AQI rose to 354, up from 306 a day earlier.""It's impossible to step out for walks anymore. Even five minutes outdoors leaves the eyes and throat burning,"" said Pramila Dhar of Sector 78. ""Parks across high-rise clusters that are usually crowded on weekend mornings remained near-empty today.""Ghaziabad fared no better, with air quality sliding further to 339 from Friday's 314, while Greater Noida slipped from 'poor' to 'very poor', reaching 336 compared to 284.Station-level readings presented a grim picture for Noida.

AGRA: A 34-year-old woman, her lover and her lover's friend were sentenced to life in jail by a court in Agra for murdering her husband after he opposed their relationship. Statements by the couple's children before the magistrate on their mother's involvement in an extra-marital affair proved crucial in the case. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on each of the convicts.The couple's eldest son, 15 years then, had stated: ""My mother is in a two-year affair with a man named Sunil Kumar. Whenever that man visited our place, she used to beat me and my siblings. I saw him and Dharmveer near my house many times. I also alerted my father about them... When my father, an auto driver, used to go out, Sunil used to quietly come and stay in a room with my mom."" His younger siblings - 13 and 8 - made similar claims before the magistrate.ADGC Pradeep Sharma said on February 14, 2019, when Ramveer Singh, 34, went missing from home, his uncle, Tikaram, launched a manhunt. Failing to trace him, Tikaram approached police to file a missing complaint. An FIR was registered two days later against Singh's wife, Kusuma Devi, then 28, lover Sunil Kumar, 28, and Dharmveer Singh, 32, both auto drivers, under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 201 (destroying evidence) at Dauki after Singh's body was found in a village well.The postmortem report revealed 12 injury marks and death due to coma as a result of anti-mortem injury. Prime suspect Kusuma was thereafter arrested on February 17, and police also found the large stick used to beat her husband to death. A burnt phone was recovered too. The other two accused were held on February 19; chargesheet was filed on May 13 that year.During trial, the accused rejected their involvement in Singh's murder and attempted to mislead court by trying to project the latter's proximity to local goons, which led to the killing. However, statements by Kusuma's kids in favour of their dad nailed the trio. Taking witness testimonies, autopsy findings and police evidence into consideration, additional district and sessions judge Sanjay Lal punished the convicts on Friday.","A 34-year-old woman, her lover and her lover's friend were sentenced to life in jail by a court in agra.

NEW DELHI: On a long standing litigation between Mumbai and Bengaluru factions of Iskcon over control of Bengaluru temple, Supreme Court had kept the verdict reserved for more than a year and gave judgment favouring the Bengaluru branch in May just prior to the retirement of presiding judge Justice A S Oka.The bench of Justices Oka and A G Masih had set aside Karnataka High Court's detailed judgment in May 2011 giving control of the Bengaluru temple to the Mumbai branch. High Court had quashed the trial court decree of April 2009 which was in favour of the Bengaluru faction.After 14 years of the HC verdict and six months of Supreme Court judgment, pronounced a week before Justice Oka's retirement, the parties are now almost back to square one as a bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and A G Masih (who was part of the bench led by Justice Oka) delivered a split verdict on the Mumbai branch's plea for review of the May 16 judgment.Justice Maheshwari found that the Mumbai branch has made out a case for review of the judgment. In his two sentence order, he said, ""Applications for listing the review petitions in open court are allowed. Notice be issued to the parties."" This would mean Justice Maheshwari felt that the Mumbai branch should be allowed to argue its case in open court pointing out the ""error apparent"" in the judgment.On the other hand, Justice Masih said, ""After having carefully gone through the review petitions, the judgment under review and the material annexed therewith, I am satisfied there is no error apparent on the face of record or any merit in the review petitions, warranting reconsideration of the judgment impugned.The review petitions are, accordingly, dismissed.""""In view of the divergent views... the review petitions be placed before the CJI for directions and to do the needful,"" the bench then said.Iskcon-Mumbai had consistently maintained that the Bengaluru faction had never functioned as an independent entity and had always operated under the Mumbai branch, and hence, the management of the temple vested with the Mumbai faction. But the trial court had allowed the Bengaluru branch's suit, and given a decree in its favour over the management of the temple affairs.

Delhi Smog Worsens Two Days After Diwali, AQI Hits Very Poor Levels

Why GRAP 3 not yet enforced?



NEW DELHI: The national capital on Saturday entered the ""red zone"" after the air quality index (AQI) crossed 400-mark, making the situation adverse for Delhiites and the citizens in the national capital region.With a 24-hour average AQI of 361, Delhi became the country’s second most polluted city, according to CPCB data. Several areas, including Wazirpur (420), Burari (418), and Vivek Vihar (411), recorded ""severe"" pollution levels, while most others hovered in the ‘very poor’ range. In the NCR, Noida (354), Greater Noida (336), and Ghaziabad (339) also reported hazardous air, underscoring the region’s worsening smog crisis.The air quality early warning system for Delhi has forecast that the city’s air will stay in the ‘very poor’ category for the coming days. Since Diwali, the capital’s air quality has largely hovered between ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’, at times deteriorating to ‘severe’ levels.Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) stage 3 has not been enforced yet because, according to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), the city’s air quality this November has remained comparatively better than the same period last year.Officials said that pollution levels have not yet reached the severe threshold that would trigger Stage 3 restrictions. They credited this improvement to timely and coordinated actions across departments, including intensified dust control, road cleaning, anti-smog operations, and stricter checks on vehicles and industrial emissions, which have helped delay the need for harsher measures.""Out of the last seven days, six have recorded better air quality than the corresponding days last year. This has been possible because of timely and coordinated action taken across departments,"" PTI quoted an official saying.""Last year, GRAP Stage 3 was imposed on November 13. This time, with support from all departments and the residents of Delhi, we hope to prevent reaching that stage,"" the official said.","The national capital on saturday entered the ""red zone"" after the air quality index (aqi) crossed 400.

""It is necessary that government conducts a proper investigation and makes facts public,"" he told reporters in Akola, breaking his silence on the row.The Rs 300 crore-deal related to transfer of 40 acres of government-owned land in Mundhwa, Pune, to a company in which Parth is one of two partners has been cancelled, Ajit said Friday after it attracted much criticism.Pawar sr brushed aside questions on why his daughter Supriya Sule seemed to be going ""soft"" on Parth amid the row, saying ""family and politics"" are different aspects. Asked why Supriya had ""defended"" Parth, he said, ""That's her personal opinion.""Asked why Parth had not been named in the FIR lodged in Pune in the case, Pawar said, ""Only the home minister (CM Devendra Fadnavis, who also holds the home portfolio) can provide accurate information on this. He's in the best position to say.""Hours later, Fadnavis told mediapersons in Gadchiroli that ""action is being taken as per law and there's no question of saving anybody"".Pawar sr, however, avoided dragging deputy CM Ajit and Parth into the controversy by limiting his response to asking for a fair probe.He said members within the Pawar family have been political rivals but that should not be mixed with family relations. ""My grandnephew (Yugendra Pawar) contested against Ajit. Within the family we have fought elections against each other,"" he said, adding that social, family and political relations should be seen in silos.On Friday, Supriya refrained from taking on Parth, unlike other Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) allies like Congress. Sule had said, ""I called Parth and he said he has not done anything wrong. If it was govt land, how was it sold? CM and the revenue minister should come out with all details.""Pawar, the architect of MVA, also said the inclusion of Raj Thackeray's Maharashtra Navnirman Sena into MVA fold must be a ""collective decision"". Responding to questions about Congress being reluctant to include MNS in the alliance, Pawar said, ""Leaders of the alliance should sit together and take a joint decision. Congress should not take an extreme position in haste."" He added a meeting of MVA is scheduled in a day or two, where clarity is expected.Regarding a potential alliance with Prakash Ambedkar's Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi, Pawar said, ""Some people met him recently, but the talks didn't progress further.""On Rahul Gandhi's allegations about voter fraud, Pawar said this cannot be brushed aside by authorities. ""EC must address vote rigging concerns. They must clear all doubts on vote theft to maintain public trust in democracy.""","Sharad pawar says maharashtra government must conduct a fair investigation into the controversial pune land deal.

Explosives Found Near Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah's Event Venue In Bengaluru, Major Attack Foiled

NEW DELHI: Union minister and former Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy on Friday dismissed speculation about a possible change of guard in the southern state, asserting that it would not be “easy” for the ruling Congress to replace incumbent chief minister Siddaramaiah “There will be no chief minister change in Karnataka as is being speculated. It is not easy for the Congress party to remove him,” Kumaraswamy told reporters in Bengaluru, according to news agency PTI.The Janata Dal (Secular) leader described the Congress stalwart as a “capable leader,” noting that he knows this well since Siddaramaiah had earlier been part of the JD(S).“He (Siddaramaiah) was with us earlier; others don’t know what he is. As he was with us earlier, we know what he is capable of doing,” Kumaraswamy said.Rumours of a leadership change have been circulating in Karnataka, with some suggesting it could happen after November 20 — the halfway mark of the Congress government’s five-year term that began in May 2023 — a period some political observers have dubbed the “November Revolution.”“I don’t have any belief in revolutions. Discussions have been going on about a revolution, but there will be none in my opinion,” Kumaraswamy remarked.When asked about deputy chief minister and state Congress chief DK Shivakumar’s chances of succeeding Siddaramaiah, Kumaraswamy took a swipe, saying, “He (Shivakumar) discusses with God every day about when he will be made the chief minister. It is between him and God.”Reacting to Shivakumar’s statement that a “revolution” would happen only in 2028 ""when the Congress returns to power again,"" Kumaraswamy added, “Many in this state in the past have said they will be chief minister or in power for the next ten or twenty years. You have seen what happened to them. Let’s see what happens.”Siddaramaiah, who joined the Congress in 2006 after being expelled from the JD(S) led by former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda, has recently reiterated that he intends to serve the full five-year term, subject to the Congress high command’s ""decision.""","Hd kumaraswamy dismisses speculation about a possible change of guard in karnataka.
