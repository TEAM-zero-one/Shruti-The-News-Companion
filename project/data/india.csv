However, due to rising conflict in the region, they were unable to continue working and expressed their desire to return home.""Upon receiving information about their situation, I immediately contacted the Minister of External Affairs. Emergency food supplies were arranged for the stranded fishermen on one of the islands. Efforts are also underway to rescue more fishermen from another island,"" Nagendran said.ince direct flights from Iran were not feasible, the fishermen were brought to Dubai by ship and, from there, flown to Delhi, eventually reaching Chennai. He expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Ministry of External Affairs for facilitating the rescue. The Tamil Nadu BJP funded the entire operation.Ajith, a fisherman from Uvari, expressed gratitude to the BJP for bringing them back.

Law College Gangrape Case- BJP's 'Fact-Finding' Team Reaches Kolkata, Slams Mamata government

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)





PUNE: The Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) in Pune on Saturday recorded the statement of the 22-year-old data scientist related to her complaint that she was allegedly raped by an unidentified delivery agent in her rented Kondhwa flat on Wednesday evening. Police said they produced the complainant before the court as she kept changing her statements during questioning.Deputy commissioner of police (Zone V) Rajkumar Shinde told TOI: ""We produced the woman before the CJM, Ms T M Ahmed, and the process of recording her statement under provisions of Section 183 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) was completed."" The section empowers a magisterial court to record the confession of an accused or the statement of a witness.Shinde said the FIR the woman, who has a BE degree and works with an IT firm in Kalyaninagar, had filed with the Kondhwa police on Thursday and her subsequent statements had numerous discrepancies. ""She continuously changed her statements during questioning,"" he said.On Thursday, the Kondhwa police had registered a case of rape, voyeurism and criminal intimidation based on the woman's complaint stating that a ""delivery agent"" stepped into her house on the pretext of delivering a parcel and getting a delivery sheet acknowledged, sprayed some chemical on her face to render her unconscious and later sexually assaulted herCity police commissioner Amitesh Kumar on Friday said investigation into the alleged rape revealed that there was ""no forced entry into the woman's flat, no chemical was sprayed to render her unconscious and the selfie on her cellphone was taken with her consent before she cropped the image"".Police had detained her friend (24), an IT professional with a firm in Baner, after evidence like his cellphone location showed that he was around the flat at the time of the alleged incident. The DCP on Saturday said the police released the woman's friend for now, but served a notice on him with a direction to join the investigation.Shinde said the process to record the complainant's statement by a magisterial court was crucial under the provisions relating to rape or sexual assault of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) ""to ensure voluntariness and reliability of such statements"" during investigation. ""It ensures transparency. Since her statement is recorded, the investigating officer can continue the investigation based on her voluntary disclosure before the CJM,"" he said.A senior police officer privy to the investigation said: ""We questioned the complainant on material points. She gave multiple oral and written statements, but they were found contradictory and misleading during verification. Her statements are not consistent with the FIR. A call to take action against her would be taken based on the outcome of the investigation. She would be referred to a counselling session.""Sources in the sessions court said the investigating officer took the CJM's permission for securing the woman's presence to record her statement because of the complexity of the case. The court considered the officer's request and recorded her statement in camera. The woman's statement was sealed in an envelope soon after it was recorded. The sealed envelope has been kept in the safe custody of the court ‘nazir' (assistant superintendent).The investigating officer will now have to secure a certified copy of her statement by seeking the court's permission. The purpose of recording her statement before the court under Section 183 of BNSS is to create a reliable record of a witness. This process aims at detering witnesses from subsequently changing their testimonies, minimise perjury and provide more trustworthy accounts of events, especially when compared to statements taken during the investigation, sources said.The CJM court's assistant public prosecutor, Priyanka Vengurlekar, confirmed that the woman's statement was recorded, but said its contents could not be made public.",The chief judicial magistrate (cjm) in pune on saturday recorded the statement of the 22-year-old data scientist related to her complaint that she was allegedly raped by an unidentified delivery agent.

NEW DELHI: Two people, a 25-year-old civil services aspirant and a 30-year-old lab technician, were killed in the massive fire at Vishal Mega Mart in central Delhi's Karol Bagh on Friday. According to the fire service, the building lacked a valid fire certificate and a case of negligence has been registered by police.The deceased were identified as Kumar Dhirender Pratap Singh and Pawan Gautam. Singh, originally from Sonbhadra in Uttar Pradesh, was found dead inside the elevator, where he is believed to have suffocated after getting trapped, while Gautam, an ITI graduate from Aligarh who worked as a lab technician, was found on the second floor.According to Delhi Fire Service, the blaze was reported at 6.44pm on Friday. Minutes later, Singh's brother, Vikram, received a desperate message from his trapped sibling. ""At 6.51pm, my brother texted me about being stuck in the lift,"" Vikram revealed to TOI. ""He pleaded, ‘Kisi tarah se bachalo, main lift mein fasa hua hoon.

""She went and requested authorities to check the lift around 7pm. They told her they had done it and hadn't detected anyone inside,"" he claimed. His body was eventually recovered at 2.30am on Saturday. ""He was unconscious when we saw him. He was shirtless and in his vest, maybe because he used his shirt to cover his face to avoid the smoke,"" said Vikram. ""I wish I had been there to go into the building and save him,"" he added.Before the tragedy, Singh had been studying in a library nearby for 4-5 hours, according to his friends. Vikram remembered his younger brother, ""He had a good nature. Our mother is a govt schoolteacher in UP and he often volunteered to teach the students whenever he visited our village.""The fire broke out in the multistorey building that housed Vishal Mega Mart, gutting its basement, ground, first, second and third floors. The structure had only two staircases and one lift, with no ventilation except the entrance. Preliminary investigations suggest the fire was caused by a short circuit on the second floor.Firefighting operations were severely hampered due to the lack of ventilation in the building. Fire officers had to use JCB machines to break open the front-facing parts of the upper floors to extinguish the flames, with 15 fire tenders and 90 firefighters engaged in the fierce struggle to control the massive blaze.TOI reached out to Vishal Mega Mart for a response, but the company had not replied at the time of filing this story.","Two killed in massive fire at vishal mega mart in central delhi's karol bagh.

Justice BR Gavai Takes Oath As India's 52nd CJI | First Buddhist and Second Dalit to Hold Office

NEW DELHI: In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court administration has written to the Centre seeking possession of the official residence of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) at the Krishna Menon Marg in the national capital.In a July 1 letter to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), the apex court administration noted that the current occupant of the residence, former CJI DY Chandrachud, has been staying there beyond the permissible period.Justice Chandrachud was the country's 50th chief justice from November 2022-2024. The current CJI, BR Gavai, is the 52nd chief justice, and took over this May.The Supreme Court administration requested the MoHUA secretary to take possession of Bungalow No. 5, Krishna Menon Marg, ""without any further delay,"" so that it is returned to the court's housing pool. The permission granted to Chandrachud to retain the accommodation expired on May 31, the letter stated.Under Rule 3B of the Supreme Court Judges (Amendment) Rules, 2022, a retired Chief Justice of India can retain type VII bungalow, a level below from the 5, Krishna Menon Marg bungalow, for a maximum period of six months post-retirement.Ex-CJI Sanjiv Khanna, who succeeded Justice Chandrachud, chose not to move into the official accommodation during his six months' tenure. Even incumbent CJI BR Gavai has opted to continue living in a previously allotted bungalow.On December 18 last year, Justice Chandrachud had written to his successor, requesting the latter's permission to continue residing in the 5, Krishna Menon Marge residence till April 30, 2025, saying although he has been allotted Bungalow No. 14 on Tughlak Road in accordance with 2022 rules, renovation work at the new residence was going on.Then-CJI Khanna gave his nod, pursuant to which MoHUA approved the retention of the type VIII bungalow at Krishna Menon Marg by Justice Chandrachud from December 11, 2024, to April 30, 2025 on payment of licence fees of around Rs 5,000 per month.The ministry conveyed the approval to the Supreme Court administration by a letter of February 13.Subsequently, Justice Chandrachud made an oral request to then CJI Khanna to continue residing in the same residence till May 31, which was also approved by the then-CJI albeit with a condition that no further extension would be granted.The July 1 letter of apex court administration flagged the breach of both the timelines and the legal framework, and said the Krishna Menon Marg residence was permitted due to ""special circumstances.""The communication of this nature to the government is a rarity for vacating the official CJI residence that too from an ex-CJI.According to government sources, in the past, several former CJIs have been informally granted extension to stay in the official residence for a limited time of two months, till they make appropriate arrangements for their accommodation post retirement.Sources confirm that Justice Chandrachud in his earlier communications has informed the apex court about the delay in moving out of the 5, Krishna Menon Marg residence in view of making the Tughlak Road Bungalow liveable for his family especially his two daughters with special needs, who are undergoing treatment at AIIMS.Sources also confirm that Justice Chandrachud has written to then CJI Khanna in April informing him that he was in process of shortlisting of an accommodation in accordance with the special needs of his daughters and urged extension of time for vacating the official residence till June 30.","Justice chandrachud was the country's 50th chief justice from november 2022-2024.

Police say woman's mental health 'not good'

NEW DELHI: Pune Police on Sunday ruled out a rape claim by a 22-year-old data scientist, calling it a ""false complaint"" that misled cops. Police commissioner Amitesh Kumar said the woman's report, which included allegations of assault by an unknown man posing as a delivery agent, was fabricated.The woman had alleged that a stranger, pretending to be a courier delivery man, entered her Kondhwa flat on Wednesday, bolted the door, sprayed a chemical to knock her unconscious, and raped her. She claimed the assailant took a selfie using her phone and left behind a threatening message.But within 24 hours, police uncovered inconsistencies in her statement.""It was found that the woman had filed a false complaint. Her complaint misled the Pune Police,"" Kumar said.He added, ""Just two days ago, an incident came before Pune City Police, which was used to create a narrative that law and order concerning women in Pune has completely collapsed, and efforts were made to portray Pune as unsafe for women. By deploying the full resources of the police administration, we solved the case within 24 hours. No one should try to defame Pune, a city known to be one of the safest, through fake narratives.According to the investigation, the man in the selfie was known to the woman. ""They have known each other for years and belong to the same community,"" Kumar said a few days back, as quoted by PTI. ""The selfie was taken by the woman herself and later edited to partially hide his face. The threatening message was typed by her too.""The man, reportedly a highly qualified professional, was detained and questioned. Forensic analysis found no evidence of a chemical attack, and CCTV footage showed no unknown visitor entering the housing complex. The apartment's digital entry system also recorded no delivery agents at the time.Kumar said, ""No chemical spray was used. The girl’s mental state is not good at present. The rape part is still under investigation.""The case had initially been registered under sections 64 (rape), 77 (voyeurism), and 351(2) (criminal intimidation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.

The selfie and text message were central to the original claim.The woman, an IT professional living in Pune's Kalyaninagar area with her younger brother, was alone at the time of the alleged incident.","Pune police on sunday ruled out a rape claim by a 22-year-old data scientist.

Poll Do you believe stricter enforcement of traffic rules will reduce road crashes in Delhi-NCR? Yes, absolutely No, it won't help

NEW DELHI: Concerned over unabated violation of traffic rules by two and three-wheelers entering the main carriageway of expressways and access-controlled stretches in Delhi-NCR, Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari has asked the Delhi Police to “strictly enforce” the ban on such vehicles on high-speed corridors.Gadkari has also directed the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to remove hoardings and illegal advertisements on national highways and expressways, as these can distract drivers and become the cause of a crash.The issues had come up for discussion at a meeting chaired by Gadkari and attended by Delhi Lt Governor V K Saxena and CM Rekha Gupta on June 4.As per the minutes of the meeting issued this week, NHAI and highway ministry officials highlighted that the entry of two and three-wheelers has been prohibited on the main carriageway of the Badarpur Elevated Highway as per a Feb 16 notification. Similarly, a Jan 2021 notification prohibits these vehicles on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway.Similarly, a notification was issued in Jan 2024 prohibiting these vehicles on UER-II, Delhi-Gurgaon and Dwarka expressways. “The traffic police were instructed to ensure strict enforcement of these restrictions across all these stretches,” reads the minutes of the meeting.Gadkari’s direction comes amid growing concerns over crashes caused by the unauthorised entry of these vehicles. Officials said, despite signage and regulations, enforcement has been lax, leading to widespread disregard for rules. “The minister had said that maintaining discipline on high-speed roads is crucial for reducing road crashes and ensuring smooth traffic flow. Only the fear of getting caught every time for violations can be a deterrent and police have to enforce this,” said a highway ministry official.TOI last week had highlighted how almost 63% of traffic rule violations on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway and the newly opened Dwarka Expressway were due to illegal entry of two and three-wheelers on these access-controlled stretches.",Union minister nitin gadkari asks delhi police to ‘strictly enforce’ ban on 2 & 3 wheelers on high-speed corridors in delhi-ncr.

NEW DELHI: CJI B R Gavai, second from the Dalit community to head the judiciary, has amended the Supreme Court Officers and Servant (Conditions of Service and Conduct) Rules, 1961, to provide for reservations to SCs, STs, OBCs, physically challenged, ex-servicemen and dependents of freedom fighters in direct recruitments to subordinate staff of the apex court.Rule 4A of the Act, amended and substituted on the CJI's instructions, has been gazetted through a notification issued on July 3. However, it omits reservation for candidates belonging to the economically weaker section (EWS), which was introduced by Parliament through Constitution (103rd Amendment) Act, 2019.The substituted Section 4A, as gazetted, reads: ""Reservation in direct recruitment to various categories of posts specified in the Schedule, for the candidates belonging to SCs, STs, OBCs, Physically Challenged, Ex-servicemen and dependant of Freedom Fighters shall be in accordance with the Rules, orders, and Notifications issued from time to time by the Government of India in respect of posts carrying the pay scale corresponding to the pay scale prescribed for the post specified in the Schedule, subject to such modification, variation or exception as the Chief Justice may, from time to time, specify. ""The 103rd Constitutional Amendment Act introduced Articles 15(6) and 16(6) to give effect to 10% reservation for EWS in govt jobs and admissions to govt and govt-aided educational institutions. It received Presidential assent on Jan 12, 2019. The constitutional validity of EWS quota was challenged in Supreme Court by more than 20 petitions, mainly on the ground that it exceeded the 50% ceiling on quota imposed by SC in its Indra Sawhney judgment in 1992.A five-judge bench led by then CJI U U Lalit on Nov 7, 2022, by three to two majority, declared that Parliament's decision to provide quota for EWS category was constitutionally valid. The majority view was shared by Justices Dinesh Maheswari, Bela M Trivedi and J B Pardiwala, while Justices Lalit and S R Bhat ruled that EWS quota was illegal.On Dec 6, 2022, NGO 'Society for the Rights of Backward Communities' filed a petition seeking review of the Nov 7 judgment. A five-judge bench led by then CJI D Y Chandrachud on May 9, 2023 dismissed the review petition, thus giving judicial impregnability to the validity of the EWS quota.","Cji b r gavai has amended the supreme court officers and servant (conditions of service and conduct) rules, 1961.

Officials can also rely on field inquiry for inclusion of names in Bihar rolls: EC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/officials-can-also-rely-on-field-inquiry-for-inclusion-of-names-in-bihar-rolls-ec/articleshow/122285938.cms,"Election Commission

11 documents specified to prove eligibility indicative: EC Official



NEW DELHI: Amid claims and counter-claims over the special intensive revision (SIR) of Bihar electoral rolls, Election Commission officials said Sunday that the poll panel's guidelines, issued on June 24, allow electors to add documents after submitting their enumeration forms, till July 25 and even during the 'claims and objections' period.Besides, electoral registration officers can rely on field inquiry or alternative proof - beyond the 11 documents listed by EC for citizenship - to decide on an elector's inclusion. The list, a source said, is ""indicative and not exhaustive"".EROs (electoral registration officers) are empowered under the law to take a call on what documents, other than those specifically mentioned, can be taken into account, the source said.They, however, clarified that Aadhaar may still not be accepted as an alternative document, since it is merely a proof of identity - defining that the 10 fingerprints, iris and photo belong to the person in whose name Aadhaar is issued - and does not establish that person's citizenship or date of birth.""SIR is being conducted as per the instructions issued by EC on June 24, 2025. There is no change in the instructions. Draft electoral roll that will be issued on Aug 1, 2025, will contain the names of persons whose enumeration forms are received by July 25.The electors can submit their documents any time before July 25. After publication of draft roll, if any document is deficient, EROs can obtain such documents from electors whose name appears in the draft roll during scrutiny in the 'claims and objections' period,"" CEC Gyanesh Kumar told TOI on Sunday.Importantly, a senior EC functionary clarified that the list of 11 documents specified by EC to prove one's eligibility for inclusion in the roll - as per Article 326 of the Constitution and provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1950 - is indicative and not exhaustive, and that the ERO has powers under the law to satisfy himself about the eligibility of a person to be enrolled as an elector on the basis of any other document or local inquiry if he deems fit. However, the ERO must make a ""speaking order"", recording in writing the reasons for such inclusion or exclusion. Even the ERO's decision is subject to a two-stage appellate process after publication of final roll, first at the level of district magistrate and then the chief electoral officer (CEO).A reading of the SIR guidelines dated June 24 confirms this. The text above the list of 11 documents mentioned in the declaration form to be signed by the elector not included in Bihar's 2003 electoral roll clearly states that the list is ""indicative (not exhaustive)"".""The advertisement (issued by Bihar chief electoral officer in some newspapers on Sunday) is in conformity with the SIR instructions issued by EC on June 24,"" the CEC told TOI.Meanwhile, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Sunday accused BJP of conspiring to deprive the people of Bihar of their voter rights through the SIR. People will surely respond to ""this BJP attack on democracy and the Constitution in the upcoming assembly elections"", he said. Citing the advertisement, he alleged that ""when the pressure from the opposition, the public, and civil society increased, EC hurriedly published advertisements, which state that now only a form needs to be filled, and showing documents is not necessary"".The EC's clarification came even as nearly 1.7 crore enumeration forms, accounting for 21.5% of Bihar's electorate, are already collected and over 7.2% uploaded on ECINET.Meanwhile, responding to the criticism directed at EC for rushing with the SIR without prior consultation with political parties, CEC Kumar said, ""During the past four months, all 4,123 EROs, all 775 district election officers and all 36 CEOs have held nearly 5,000 meetings with 28,000 political party representatives. EC has also invited all recognised political parties for interaction. No one was satisfied with the current status of electoral rolls for one reason or the other.

For many battling depression and dark thoughts, a single phone call is making all the difference.The UT has emerged as India's leading performer in responding to mental health distress calls. Driving this transformation is Tele MANAS, a Centre-backed digital mental health support initiative. This was revealed during the national launch of video consultations under Tele MANAS and Hindi version of the Tele MANAS App 1.0 early this month.The central govt announced the launch of National Tele Mental Health Programme in October 2022 to provide free, round-the-clock mental health counselling through digital platforms, aiming to make mental health care accessible nationwide. A year later, Tele MANAS centres were established across various states, with the one in J&K emerging as among the first to become fully operational.Of the 1,03,504 calls received by the centre so far, 87,450 were user-initiated while 15,731 were follow-up or outreach calls made by Tele MANAS. Topping the country list in terms of population-to-call ratio, the J&K Tele MANAS centre is also among the busiest, handling nearly 150 calls a day.The centre, based on the premises of Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (IMHANS), Kashmir, has 19 counsellors, seven psychiatrists, and a backup from a team of clinical psychologists from IMHANS, Kashmir.When video consultations under the programme began in October 2023, J&K was among three states/UTs chosen. Since then, over 400 video consultations have been held and J&K is leading in both volume and adoption, Dr Naveen Kumar C, principal investigator at the national coordinating centre, said. He said video consultations were a significant shift from audio-only interactions as it allowed far more effective clinical engagement.Prof Arshid Hussain, Tele MANAS in-charge at IMHANS, Kashmir, attributed the service's success to a combination of J&K's digitally connected population and awareness about the programme among them. He said the centre was getting calls from all over J&K, including areas like Gurez and Karnah along the LoC in the valley, and border areas of Rajouri, Poonch, Doda, Kishtwar, Kathua and Reasi in Jammu.The most common issue reported through Tele MANAS has been persistent low mood-related depressive symptoms, accounting for 38.5% of all cases. This is followed by anxiety-related issues, including generalized anxiety, panic attacks and phobias, making up nearly 20% of calls. Around 9.27% users sought help for stress linked to exams, workplace pressure, or relationship difficulties. Nearly 4% showed symptoms of losing touch with reality like hallucinations or delusional thinking while disturbing, suicidal thoughts or past attempts were recorded in 3.4% of consultations.","The ut has emerged as india's leading performer in responding to mental health distress calls.

‘It’s Up To Them’ Owaisi Ready To Join Mahagathbandhan In Bihar Elections, Says NDA Must Go

EC uploads 2003 rolls, says most voters need not worry

Opposition says revision targets the poor, migrants

EC Trying To Push NRC 'Through Backdoor'- TMC Blasts Poll Body, Alleges 'Nazi' Action | Bihar Polls

Massive on-ground push by all parties

NEW DELHI: A fresh controversy has erupted in poll-bound Bihar over the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of the state's electoral rolls, a process the Election Commission of India (ECI) insists is legally mandated, even as opposition parties allege it could end up deleting ""tens of lakhs"" of genuine voters, especially the poor, migrants, and those on the margins.While the EC said that the revision, happening after 22 years, is in line with the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act, opposition parties claim the timing is suspiciously close to the assembly polls and could ""skew the voter base"".""There is nothing more transparent in a democracy than the law. “Despite apprehensions of some persons, SIR will ensure that all eligible persons are included,” Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar told TOI.As part of the roll-revise process, voters may be asked to submit documents to support their claims, not just for themselves, but also for their parents if their names are mentioned. Each document must be self-attested and submitted separately for the individual, father, and mother.However, there's one major relief: If a person's name appears in the Bihar electoral roll dated January 1, 2003, that alone will be treated as sufficient proof, no additional documents will be needed in that case.Highlighting the exclusion of Aadhaar from this voter revision process, Congress's in charge of Bihar Krishna Allavaru accused the EC of ""acting under government pressure"".""Whenever the government faces a crisis, its agencies begin such actions,"" he said.""It is strange that the very voters who elected this government are now being asked to prove their identity. By excluding Aadhaar from this voter revision process, eight crore people are being asked to submit documents they don't have,"" the Congress leader added.Trying to calm nerves, the EC clarified this week that 4.96 crore out of Bihar's 7.89 crore registered voters won't need to submit parental documents during the revision. This includes those already listed in the 2003 electoral rolls or born to such electors.To make things smoother for booth level officers (BLOs) and voters alike, the EC has uploaded the 2003 Bihar rolls on its website for easy access.On Wednesday, leaders from 11 opposition parties, including Congress, RJD, TMC, DMK, SP, JMM, and Left parties, met the Election Commission, calling the revision ""disastrous"". They warned that the EC’s guidelines on verifying if someone is ""ordinarily resident"" in a constituency may disqualify large sections of migrants, who form a major chunk of Bihar’s electorate.The opposition argued that a revision this close to elections casts doubt on the EC’s intentions. But interestingly, despite their public opposition, these parties have joined the ground-level process, appointing thousands of booth level agents (BLAs) to keep watch.Contrary to their protests, opposition parties have gone all in. The RJD has deployed 47,143 BLAs, second only to BJP's 51,964. Congress has appointed 8,586, while Left outfits like CPI(ML), CPM, and CPI have sent in their own agents.
