Who is Shabir Ahmed Lone

Arrests and suspected attack plans





NEW DELHI: The Bangladesh-based terror module recently dismantled by Delhi Police was allegedly run by Shabir Ahmed Lone, an operative investigators say maintained direct links with senior Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) commanders.Lone was also in touch with 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Saeed and operations chief Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi.Delhi Police on Monday said it had busted a terror module linked to Pakistan-based LeT handlers operating from Bangladesh, arresting eight suspects and averting what officials described as a “major untoward incident”.Investigators describe Lone as a long-time Lashkar-e-Taiba associate who has been on security agencies’ radar for nearly two decades. He’s a resident of Ganderbal in Kashmir, currently based in Bangladesh.He was arrested in 2007 with an AK-47 rifle and grenades and was allegedly part of a planned fidayeen attack targeting a senior political leader.He spent about a decade in jail on terrorism charges before being released on bail in 2019. Officials say that after his release he fled to Bangladesh, where he re-established contact with Lashkar-e-Taiba leadership and rebuilt his network.“Initial investigations have revealed that he reconnected with the LeT leadership and re-established his organisation to carry out terrorist activities,” Special Cell Additional CP Pramod Kumar Kushwaha said.Delhi Police sources say Lone was operating the India-based module on behalf of LeT and remained in direct touch with its top commanders. His alleged contact with Hafiz Saeed places him in the upper tier of the group’s external operations network, investigators believe.According to investigators, Lone coordinated activities from Bangladesh through encrypted messaging platforms and intermediaries. He was allegedly tasked with recruiting and radicalising undocumented Bangladeshi migrants in India, arranging fake identity documents such as Aadhaar cards, and setting up logistics bases, including a rented safe house near Kolkata.Police also linked the network to anti-India posters that appeared in Delhi and Kolkata, which were allegedly printed in Kolkata after a PDF was sent from Bangladesh by Lone.The eight arrested suspects, picked up from Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, were allegedly working in the garment sector while concealing their identities with forged documents.Security agencies are probing whether the group was planning attacks on a temple or other crowded locations in Delhi. Alerts had earlier warned of a possible improvised explosive device (IED) strike near the Red Fort and other high-footfall areas.Authorities are also examining whether the network had any link to the November 2025 car blast near the Red Fort that killed 12 people. Lone, believed to be in Bangladesh, remains a key figure in Lashkar-e-Taiba’s cross-border recruitment and operational network targeting India.","Shabir ahmed lone behind 8 arrested linked to bangladesh terror module.

He has been on the run since his close aide Anal da was killed in Jharkhand last month. Besra is possibly hiding along the Jharkhand-Odisha border, and the forces are on his trail. ""Chances are that he will take a cue from Devji's surrender and follow suit,"" an officer said.Meanwhile, multiple operations are going on simultaneously along the Chhattisgarh-Telangana-Odisha-Jharkhand axis, to keep up pressure on the remaining Maoists to surrender or face neutralisation by the security forces.","The expected surrender of cpi(maoist) de-facto general secretary thippiri tirupahii alias devji, alongside another central committee member malla raji reddy alias sangram, is like ""the proverbial last nail in the coffin"", say sources in the counter-naxal establishment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128732795,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-13362,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Political messaging behind timing of installation of Rajaji’s bust?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/political-messaging-behind-timing-of-installation-of-rajajis-bust/articleshow/128727022.cms,"NEW DELHI: The timing of installation of C Rajagopalachari's bust replacing Edward Lutyens at Rashtrapati Bhawan gains significance as the southern state is going for polls in next few months where BJP has struggled to make major inroads. The invitees to Monday's event also included “guests from Tamil Nadu”.The replacement of Lutyens bust with Rajaji serves a dual purpose — it strengthens the govt’s anti-colonial narrative at national level and in Tamil Nadu, it signals honouring a Tamil statesman by placing his bust in the residence of the head of state.In his address at the programme, education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said Rajaji was a symbol of Indian civilisation and the sacred ‘sengol’, which has been placed in Parliament was a realisation of his vision.

"NEET-PG cut-off row: Exam doesn't certify competence, says Centre; SC says will examine impact on quality",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neet-pg-cut-off-row-exam-doesnt-certify-competence-says-centre-sc-says-will-examine-impact-on-quality/articleshow/128709656.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday said it would examine whether the sharp reduction in the qualifying percentile for NEET-PG 2025-26 would affect standards in postgraduate medical education.Justice Narasimha observed that while the Union was justified in stating that NEET-PG was not an entry-level MBBS exam and that candidates are already qualified doctors, the court would still have to consider the impact of drastically lowering the cut-off.“Adversely affecting the quality of education is what we are more concerned, more than anything. More than anything, it is about the quality. You will have to satisfy us that the reduction of the cutoff so drastically, virtually bringing it to zero and non-existence... Though you are justified in saying that this is not like entry into MBBS, this is like a post-graduation. It stands on a different footing because those who apply are already doctors. But still in the context of competition, we will have to reflect,” he said.Defending its decision, the Centre told the court that NEET-PG did not certify minimum competence. “NEET-PG is not to certify minimum competence, which stands established by the MBBS qualification itself of the candidates but to generate an inter se merit list for allocation of limited postgraduate seats,” the Union said in its affidavit.It added that NEET-PG scores reflected relative performance and exam design and “cannot be construed as determinative of clinical incompetence”.The government further said concerns about patient safety were misplaced, as all candidates admitted to postgraduate courses are already licensed MBBS doctors and are legally allowed to practise. During postgraduate studies, they work under constant supervision of senior faculty.It also said the decision to reduce the percentile was taken by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the National Medical Commission due to a large number of vacant seats. Around 70,000 postgraduate seats were available for 2025-26, with over 2.24 lakh candidates appearing. After Round 2, 9,621 all-India quota seats remained vacant.A plea has challenged a January 13, 2026 notice issued by the National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences reducing the qualifying percentile for the third round of NEET-PG 2025-26 counselling.Under the revised criteria, the minimum qualifying percentile for unreserved candidates was reduced from the 50th percentile to the 7th percentile. For unreserved persons with disabilities candidates, it was reduced to the 5th percentile. For Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes candidates, the percentile was reduced to zero.","The supreme court said it would examine whether the sharp reduction in the qualifying percentile for neet-pg 2025-26 would affect standards in postgraduate medical education.

NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Monday backed Congress MP Rahul Gandhi after party veteran Mani Shankar Aiyar publicly suggested West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee — rather than Gandhi — as the leader of the opposition INDIA bloc.Abdullah said Gandhi, as leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha, has been raising issues and taking on the BJP-led government at every opportunity, and questioned what more his detractors expected of him.The Jammu and Kashmir CM's National Conference is among the constituents of the Congress-led front.""Tell me, what has Rahul Gandhi lacked in competing against the BJP? He is consistently the one person who targets the BJP, always opposes the BJP, and targets the government on every issue. That is the job of the leader of the opposition. What more do you want from Rahul Gandhi? In that regard, can someone tell me what he has lacked?"" Abdullah told reporters on the sidelines of the Khelo India winter games in Gulmarg.Speaking in Kolkata on Sunday, Aiyar suggested that the Congress should cede the leadership of the INDIA bloc to regional parties and proposed that Banerjee — a three-term CM who heads the Trinamool Congress in poll-bound West Bengal — lead the national opposition alliance.Reacting to Aiyar’s remarks, Abdullah described them as the former diplomat’s “personal opinion.”“Now, as for Mani Shankar Aiyar, he has given his personal opinion. He has the right to his opinion; no one can say he doesn’t have the right to speak his mind,” the National Conference vice president stated.“But ultimately, when a decision is made, it will be taken by the INDIA bloc collectively. Everyone will discuss it together. So far, there has been no discussion on leadership in any meeting of the INDIA bloc,” he added.The INDIA coalition was formed in July 2023 to take on the BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. While the alliance failed to stop the BJP from securing a third consecutive term in office, it succeeded in pushing the ruling party below the halfway mark for the first time since 2014.",Mani shankar aiyar suggested west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee as the leader of the opposition india bloc.

‘Non-earning doesn’t mean idle’: Delhi High Court affirms value of homemaker’s work; grants maintenance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/non-earning-doesnt-mean-idle-delhi-high-court-affirms-value-of-homemakers-work-grants-maintenance/articleshow/128707878.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Monday said that disregarding the work of a homemaker is unjust, as it helped their spouse function effectively.Hearing a case of grant of maintenance to an estranged wife under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, justice Swarana Kanta Sharma observed that a wife's unemployment could not be equated with idleness or deliberate dependence, and the law must recognise the economic value of her contribution to the home.""The assumption that a non-earning spouse is 'idle' reflects a misunderstanding of domestic contributions,"" justice Sharma said. ""To describe non-employment as idleness is easy; to recognise the labour involved in sustaining a household is far more difficult,"" she added.A magisterial court had earlier refused to grant interim maintenance to the woman on the grounds that she was able-bodied and well-educated but had chosen not to seek employment.The high court noted that the ability to earn and actual earnings are two different things, and simply having the capacity to earn cannot be used as a reason to deny maintenance.“Running a household, taking care of children, supporting the family, and adjusting one’s life around the career and transfers of the earning spouse are all forms of work,” the court said. “These tasks are unpaid and often unrecognised, and they do not show up in bank statements or taxable income.Yet, they form the invisible framework that keeps many families going,” it said.The court also noted that in Indian society, women are still often expected to leave employment after marriage. However, in many matrimonial disputes, husbands have wrongly argued against paying maintenance to their well-qualified wives by claiming they chose not to work.It also recognised that a woman who leaves her profession because of marriage or family responsibilities cannot be expected to return later at the same level, salary, or professional standing she once held.In this case, the court found no evidence of any past or current employment or earnings by the wife and awarded her Rs 50,000 under the law protecting women from domestic violence.",Delhi high court says disregarding the work of a homemaker is unjust.
