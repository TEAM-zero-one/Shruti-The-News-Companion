SC questions TN move to use temple funds for marriage halls' construction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-questions-tn-move-to-use-temple-funds-for-marriage-halls-construction/articleshow/123933142.cms,"NEW DELHI: Questioning Tamil Nadu govt's decision to use surplus funds of temples to build marriage halls, Supreme Court on Tuesday said the assets and premises of religious place should not be used for construction of such halls where vulgar dance and songs might be played.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said that it would not only be dance and music but people would even seek serving of liquor and there will be no control on such activity if it is allowed. The court turned down the plea to stay Madras high court order which had stayed the state govt decision, virtually restraining the state authority not to use temple funds. The court made it clear that spending of even a penny would amount to contempt.HC had quashed the govt orders allowing use of surplus funds belonging to five temples at different locations in Tamil Nadu. The state thereafter moved the apex court against the order of HC.Allaying the apprehension of the court that the temple premises would be misused, the state govt submitted that the construction of marriage halls was for public purpose and added that marrying in temple premises was very normal in the state.Senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Jaideep Gupta said marriage in temples is always performed as per religious ritual without music and dance and sanctity of the religious place would not be violated.The bench, however, asked them why funds should not be used in setting up charitable educational institutions or hospitals.

Humour gives Modi a special edge in politics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/humour-gives-modi-a-special-edge-in-politics/articleshow/123932993.cms,"NEW DELHI: Even his opponents have acknowledged PM's oratorical skills. But what makes him so effective, as evident in his success in turning elections around to BJP's advantage, is also his use of humour as a lance.Deploying witty one-liners and playful jabs, rooted in common idioms and everyday experiences, he often has the audience in stitches, and the targets squirming.His associates recall that as Gujarat chief minister, Modi would riff on the immortal dialogue from Sholay and mock Congress for their ""cynical politics"" of luring voters by making promises which they never meant to keep. 'Arre O Sambha, kitne vote laaye?' he would say, and the audience would roar in approval.He turned the personalised attacks on him to his advantage: ""I eat 2-3 kilos of gaali daily, so nothing affects me!"" The line stuck, as he repeated it years later as the PM, uttering it in Parliament.In 2020, when Rahul Gandhi interrupted his speech in Parliament, Modi teased, ""I spoke for 30-40 minutes, but the current took this long to reach.

Key cultural and social themes of this year’s celebrations include:

Unity and national pride among Emirati citizens.

Inclusion and participation of the UAE’s large expatriate community, invited to take part in public festivities.

A continued emphasis on modernity integrated with tradition, evident in the use of drone shows and digital storytelling alongside heritage performances.





The United Arab Emirates is preparing for an especially elaborate celebration of its 54th National Day, observed annually on December 2. Authorities have officially declared December 2 and 3 (Tuesday and Wednesday) as public holidays, with strong speculation that December 1 (Monday) may also be granted as a holiday—potentially creating a four- or even five-day weekend. As the country marks more than half a century of union, preparations are underway for one of the largest Eid Al Etihad commemorations to date, blending deep-rooted cultural traditions with high-tech spectacles across the seven emirates.The UAE Cabinet has confirmed December 2 and 3, 2025 as official public holidays in honour of Eid Al Etihad, or Festival of the Union, commemorating the founding of the nation on December 2, 1971. With these days falling on a Tuesday and Wednesday, the inclusion of Monday, December 1, as a holiday could extend the break to four days, or possibly five depending on the weekend alignment.This potential long weekend is expected to benefit both social and economic activities. Residents and families will have more time to travel within the country, participate in public festivities, or take advantage of the extended holiday period for leisure or short-term vacations.Authorities have not yet confirmed the status of December 1, but based on prior years and UAE holiday policies, there is growing anticipation that an official announcement will follow soon.The UAE’s 54th National Day celebrations are set to feature a series of expansive and coordinated events across all emirates, with major public and private venues playing host to cultural, entertainment, and community-focused programs.These innovations highlight the UAE’s unique fusion of cultural heritage and modern innovation.Public transportation services across major cities are expected to extend operational hours, while law enforcement and municipal bodies are preparing traffic and safety protocols to manage the anticipated increase in footfall at celebration venues.At the centre of the celebrations will be a grand official ceremony on Tuesday, December 2, to be attended by the UAE’s leadership. While the venue for the main event has not yet been revealed, organisers have confirmed it will be a site of deep cultural and national relevance.In 2024, the ceremony was held at Jebel Hafeet in Al Ain, where the nation’s heritage and vision for the future were presented through immersive storytelling and performances. A similarly meaningful location is expected to be selected for the 2025 event, and details are expected to be made public in the coming weeks.Preparations officially began on Union Pledge Day, marking the symbolic start of a nationwide effort to build an inclusive, celebratory experience that reflects the UAE’s values of unity and diversity.The 54th National Day serves as a reminder of the UAE’s evolution from its unification in 1971 into a global centre for innovation, commerce, and cross-cultural engagement. Eid Al Etihad is not only a time of celebration but also of reflection—honouring the nation’s history while highlighting its ambitions for the future.Organisers have also released behind-the-scenes footage from the 2024 ceremony, showcasing the depth of planning and artistic execution that goes into these annual events. The footage aims to build excitement and demonstrate the UAE’s commitment to making National Day a culturally resonant and visually compelling occasion.On the economic front, long public holidays like these are known to boost local tourism and retail sectors, with increased activity in hotels, restaurants, and shopping destinations. Travel agencies typically report a spike in bookings, as residents look to make the most of the extended break for domestic or short international getaways.","Uae national day 2025 includes december 2–3 holidays, major cultural events, fireworks, and possible long weekend.

NEW DELHI: Close on the heels of his two-day tour of the North-East last week, PM Narendra Modi appears to be preparing for another tour of the region. He is likely to visit Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh later this month, his back-to-back trips, which hardly featured on the travel plans of his predecessors, being another instance that demonstrates his relentless travel zeal, which he has shown since his days as an RSS pracharak, has not dimmed with age or changes in role.These excursions have provided opportunities for him to disseminate his messages, expedite the implementation of schemes, and gather feedback.On Wednesday, he will mark his 75th birthday in MP, launching welfare schemes, in keeping with his plank of inclusive development.Modi's journeys have been an integral part of his politics. In 1990, he helped organise the Somnath-Ayodhya Rath Yatra, igniting pride amongst Hindus that laid the foundations for BJP to emerge at the national level.The Ekta Yatra (1991-92), which he led along with former BJP chief MM Joshi, and which culminated in hoisting the national flag at Srinagar's Lal Chowk, symbolised defiance of terrorism.As Gujarat CM, Modi's Gujarat Gaurav Yatra (2002) restored hope after a devastating earthquake, while the Swarnim Gujarat Yatra (2010) celebrated the state's progress. ""Each journey was a bridge to the people, rooted in their aspirations,"" said BJP national media head Anil Baluni.""From his days as an RSS pracharak to his role as India's PM, Modi's travels have always been about more than speeches. They are about meeting people where they are, listening to their dreams, and turning their stories into national pride,"" the BJP functionary said.The effort has been supplemented by his monthly radio address, ' Mann Ki Baat ', an innovation that he has skillfully used to weave individual feats into his larger message of Viksit Bharat.Whether celebrating a tribal woman reviving Santhali handlooms in Odisha or cheering at Pulwama's first night cricket match, the PM has been actively involved in celebrating such achievements.The Covid pandemic saw him utilise addresses and app-based outreach to transform a public health crisis into a mass movement, fostering unity.His words during security crises, like ""ghar mein ghus ke marenge"", have been the vehicles of signaling collective resolve and rally spirits during crises. He stood in solidarity with K Sivan and other Isro scientists when the Chandrayaan-2 mission failed, and has been playing the understanding patriarch-cum-counsellor to anxiety-filled students during his 'Pariksha Pe Charcha'.","Pm narendra modi appears to be preparing for another tour of the north-east.

Chhewang resigned as LAB chairman on July 5 and was succeeded by Wangchuk two days later, fueling speculation he would front the talks.Wangchuk began a 35-day fast on Sept 9, accusing Centre of stalling dialogue “on restoring Ladakh’s democratic rights”.Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, crafted for tribal areas in the Northeast, grants special protections over land, culture, and resources through autonomous councils. Since the 2019 bifurcation of J&K into two Union territories, Ladakhis have demanded similar safeguards, warning of demographic and industrial pressures.Union home ministry set up a high-powered panel in Jan 2023 following prolonged protests. Its last meeting with LAB and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA) on May 27 yielded a domicile policy but no progress since.Kargil Autonomous Hill Development Council chairman M Jaffar Akhoon urged Wangchuk to call off his strike.“Whatever we are to achieve, it has to come from govt, be it statehood, Sixth Schedule, or any other benefit. These issues will be decided at the talks. If you go on a hunger strike before dialogue even begins, it will not be a good move,” Akhoon said.BJP functionaries also appealed for an end to the fast, warning that “outside activists with radical views” had joined the protest. The party also blamed LAB’s internal rifts for stalled talks, alleging Chhewang was sidelined.Wangchuk has linked his protest to Leh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) elections due in Oct — calling it a test of BJP’s credibility. “In the previous elections, the party listed Sixth Schedule for Ladakh as its first priority in its manifesto. But now, after five years, they want to bury that point,” he had said.BJP swept the 2020 LAHDC-Leh polls, winning 15 of 26 seats. The council was created in 1995 under then PM PV Narasimha Rao, with a parallel body for Kargil set up in 2003 by then J&K CM Mufti Mohammad Sayeed.","Former mp thupstan chhewang will head a buddhist delegation in talks with union govt on ladakh’s demand for sixth schedule status and statehood.

Some politicians alleged the prolonged NH closure in the peak fruit harvest season was part of a conspiracy to hit Kashmir’s economy.PDP’s Iltija Mufti met LG Manoj Sinha on Tuesday and sought his intervention to expedite the highway repair work. She also appealed for an interim package for fruit growers.While PDP and some other parties blamed Omar govt for the crisis that fruit growers in the Valley are facing due to the NH closure, the CM had on Monday expressed displeasure with NHAI’s failure to restore the road in 20 days.A cornered Omar has held several meetings since Monday, seeking a solution to the crisis. At his initiative, Union minister for road, transport and highways Nitin Gadkari convened a meeting on Tuesday to review the restoration of the highway.“The meeting deliberated on immediate steps required to fully restore NH-44 for the urgent movement of fruit-laden trucks and uninterrupted supply of essentials,” said the CM, who joined through virtual mode.The highway had suffered major damage in several stretches, particularly in Udhampur, after heavy rains on Aug 26-27, which triggered flash floods and landslides. The restoration work is still ongoing.On Tuesday, authorities permitted traffic movement from Jammu to Srinagar, while trucks carrying essential commodities were allowed from Udhampur to Kashmir Valley, bringing some relief to people facing shortage of essentials. However, no vehicle movement from Srinagar towards Jammu was allowed.This prompted Srinagar MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi of governing NC to allege it was a deliberate attack on Kashmir’s economy. Horticulture and agriculture contributed 75% to Kashmir’s GDP, and allowing fruits worth crores to rot in stranded trucks was intended at making the Valley’s economy dysfunctional, he alleged.Awami Ittehad Party, too, alleged that Kashmir’s economy was being deliberately choked, and staged a protest.Peoples Conference chief and Handwara MLA Sajad Lone urged Omar to travel to Delhi and ensure expeditious clearance of the highway.CPM legislator M Y Tarigami and Congress J&K president Tariq Hamid Karra blamed the Centre for the crisis. Karra described the widening of Jammu-Srinagar highway as a “failed project”, alleging that the Union govt’s approach of blasting the mountains to widen the roads lacked scientific basis and was responsible for the widespread destruction in the Himalayan states, with nature taking its revenge.Jammu Chamber of Commerce and Industries president Arun Gupta, too, wrote to Gadkari, urging that concrete steps be taken to make the highway fully operational at the earliest.",Jammu-srinagar national highway has remained closed to heavy traffic for the past 20 days.

anti-conversion laws

after states' responses

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Tuesday asked states, which have enacted anti-conversion legislations and most of which are governed by BJP, to file their responses to pleas challenging stringent provisions in those laws criminalising inter-faith marriages. The laws seek to prohibit conversion through threat, allurement, deceit or influence. At the same time, SC put the onus on individuals to prove their marital ties haven't been forged through deceit.A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K V Vinod Chandran asked the states which have enacted the anti-conversion laws, also known as 'Freedom of Religion Acts', to respond to the allegations levelled by petitioners, including Teesta Setalvad-led Citizens for Justice and Peace , People's Union for Civil Liberties, women's wing of Communist Party of India - National Federation of Indian Women and Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind.The states which have enacted anti-conversion laws include UP, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, MP, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Haryana, Odisha, HP, Jharkhand, Karnataka and Arunachal Pradesh.Responding to the plea by petitioners for staying the laws, the bench said it will consider freezing them after the states file their responses. It asked the states to file their response in four weeks and posted the matter for hearing after six weeks.Senior advocate C U Singh, appearing for CJP, said the petitioner has sought permission to amend the petition to challenge the changes made in the anti-conversion law of Uttar Pradesh, which now provide for a minimum punishment of 20 years incarceration on conviction under the law. He said getting bail under such stringent laws would be very difficult. The bench permitted the petitioner to amend the petition.Senior advocate Indira Jaising sought transfer of a petition, which is pending in Madhya Pradesh high court challenging the state's anti-conversion law, to Supreme Court. Additional solicitor general K M Nataraj said all petitions pending in HCs could be transferred to SC for adjudication to avoid multiplicity of proceedings on the same issue and for a comprehensive ruling.The court ordered the de-tagging of advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay's plea seeking ban on conversion. The CJI asked how conversion could be banned, leading the advocate to say he was for stringent laws against conversion by marriage based on deceit and allurement.","Supreme court asks states which have enacted anti-conversion legislations to file their responses to pleas challenging provisions in those laws.

He also launched the NCB's drug disposal campaign and destroyed 1.37 lakh kilograms of drugs worth Rs 4,800 crore at 11 locations.Addressing the inaugural session of the second National Conference of the Heads of Anti-Narcotics Task Force (ANTF) of states and UTs in New Delhi, Shah pointed out that while between 2004 and 2013, the quantity of drugs seized was 26 lakh kilograms, valued at Rs 40,000 crore, From 2014 to 2025, this increased to 1 crore kilograms, valued at Rs 1.65 lakh crore.""Between 2004 and 2014, drugs worth Rs 3.63 lakh crore were disposed of, whereas between 2014 and 2025, drugs worth Rs 35.21 lakh crore had been disposed of.

Delhi issues guidelines for street dog management,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-issues-guidelines-for-street-dog-management/articleshow/123932627.cms,"Harassment of dog feeders to invite legal action

NEW DELHI: Designated feeding spots in every ward, protection for animal feeders, special handling of aggressive and rabid dogs, 24x7 complaint redressal, and perks for adopting dogs of Indian breeds: these are part of fresh guidelines issued by the Delhi govt on Tuesday for managing street dogs, eradicating rabies and reducing human-dog conflict.The civic body will issue SOPs on these in a week, a senior official said.Under the rules, all pet dogs above three months of age are to be registered. These registrations will remain valid only if the rabies vaccination of the pets is up to date.The rules have been framed in compliance with Supreme Court and high court directions and the Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules, 2023. Officials said these are aimed at balancing public safety with animal welfare, while ensuring uniform implementation of sterilisation, vaccination and feeding protocols across the city.The guidelines follow the Supreme Court's ruling on Aug 22, in which it modified its earlier directive mandating confinement of stray dogs in Delhi-NCR in shelters. It clarified that these dogs may be released in their original habitation after being dewormed and vaccinated. Amid protests and violence against animal feeders in different parts of the country, it prohibited public feeding of strays, and impleaded all states and UTs to facilitate the framing of a uniform policy.According to Delhi's guidelines, feeding spots for community dogs will be identified by RWAs and residents in each locality, keeping in view the territorial nature of dogs. ""These points will be clearly marked with signboards, and feeding at any other location will not be permitted. Animal caregivers will also be responsible for maintaining cleanliness at these sites. Any harassment, obstruction or threats to feeders, especially women, senior citizens or volunteers, will invite strict legal action,"" said a senior official.To encourage cooperation, the government has announced that RWAs making effective arrangements for feeding will be recognised and rewarded.A senior official said residents adopting Indian dogs will be exempt from registration fees, while sterilisation and first vaccinations for such pets will be provided free of cost at designated ABC centres.Animals suspected to be rabid, violent, and aggressive shall be kept under observation at ABC centres. ""Rabid dogs shall be isolated until their natural death, with carcasses disposed of scientifically,"" say the guidelines. Non-rabid dogs shall be sterilised, administered anti-rabies vaccine, and released at the place of capture.Cruelty of any kind during capture is prohibited; only trained handlers are authorised to carry out the process.To ensure accountability and swift resolution of grievances, each municipal body has been directed to establish a round-the-clock complaint redressal mechanism. This includes setting up dedicated helplines and online portals for registering complaints related to dog bites, suspected rabies cases and lapses in the ABC programme. Complaint Control Cells will maintain registers of all grievances, and decisions of local authorities may be challenged before the State ABC Monitoring Committee.","Delhi govt issues guidelines for managing street dogs, eradicating rabies and reducing human-dog conflict.
