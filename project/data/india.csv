'Such things happen in big cities': Karnataka home minister on molestation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/such-things-happen-in-big-cities-karnataka-home-minister-on-molestation/articleshow/120080688.cms,"Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara

BENGALURU: Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara sparked outrage Monday by appearing to make light of safety concerns stoked by an unidentified stalker molesting a woman in Bengaluru's Bharathi Layout, saying that ""in a big city like Bengaluru, incidents like this do take place here and there"".Parameshwara's remark came amid a search for a suspect caught on CCTV camera stalking two women, one of whom he held against a wall and allegedly molested at 1.52am on April 3. The home minister said police were working round-the-clock ""in rain and cold"" to prevent crimes that were ""unfortunate"", albeit not ""uncommon"" in a city the size of Karnataka's capital. ""I regularly tell the Bengaluru police commissioner (B Dayananda) to ensure patrolling of every area in a disciplined and effective way.""BJP demanded Congress MPs Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra respond to Parameshwara's remark. In Delhi, BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla called Karnataka's home minister ""a serial offender"" when it came to making such statements. ""This is a brazen display of a misogynist, patriarchal, sexist and obnoxious mindset,"" Poonawalla said.He alleged that crimes against women had spiked 50% in Congress-governed Karnataka and yet the state's home minister was ""trivialising serious offences"". Police said CCTV footage of the incident was shared by Lokesh Gowda, a businessman. The women told police they didn't want to file a complaint or have their statements recorded.","Karnataka home minister g parameshwara sparked outrage by appearing to make light of safety concerns stoked by an unidentified stalker molesting a woman.

Becoming HC judge is tougher now: Less than 50% make it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/becoming-hc-judge-is-tougher-now-less-than-50-make-it/articleshow/120079912.cms,"‘Interviews give first-hand info about legal acumen’

NEW DELHI: For three decades, lawyers were virtually assured of becoming high court judges once their names were recommended by the HC collegia to the CJI-led three-member Supreme Court collegium. The success rate was 85-90% then, but now it has become much tougher as less than 50% of those recommended were cleared by the SC collegium, which subjected the persons, aspiring to become constitutional court judges, to a suitability test through interview/interaction, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.Earlier, the SC collegium had a liberal scrutiny of antecedents by focusing only on the number of important cases argued by the lawyers and the Intelligence Bureau (IB) report detailing their reputation among the advocate community. Almost all the lawyers recommended by HC collegia — barring 10-15% who were dropped because of adverse IB reports or below par income signifying lack of practice — made it to the final list of names sent to the Centre for appointment.Such was the ease of scrutiny that little over a decade ago, the Supreme Court collegium had approved the appointment of a sitting CJI’s sister as a judge of a HC despite her annual income being less than Rs 1 lakh. Her appointment assured her of a judge’s pension.New Delhi: A month after becoming CJI, Justice Sanjiv Khanna in consultation with justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant decided to conduct personal interaction (interview) of the people recommended by HC collegia to understand their judicial outlook and suitability for judgeship in a constitutional court.This move became expedient, despite not being part of the procedure for appointment of HC judges devised by SC through two judgments in 1990s, given the increasing number of controversies created by few motor-mouth judges, some shocking judgments by HC judges and the issue of corruption.SC was forced to take suo motu cognisance of utterances of judges on public platform and judgments that gave skewed meaning to attempt to rape. The interaction/interview with aspiring constitutional court judges has reduced the success rate to below 50% in past few months.As many as 101 names were sent by collegia of 12 HCs – Andhra Pradesh, Allahabad, Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi, Gujarat, Manipur, Orissa, Patna, Rajasthan, Telangana and Uttarakhand. But the collegium comprising CJI Khanna, and Justices Gavai and Kant patiently interviewed all of them and finally selected only 49 of them as suitable for appointment as judges of the HC, which is less than 50% of the recommended names.“Thank God we started interviewing the candidates. It gives us first-hand information about not only the legal acumen and experience of the lawyers, but also their suitability for judgeship. It is tedious to interview candidates at length, but it makes the selection fairer,” collegium judges told TOI.","For three decades, lawyers were virtually assured of becoming high court judges.

""Any receipt or utilisation of the foreign contribution beyond the above said time limits shall be a violation of FCRA, 2010, and in case of any violation, necessary punitive action shall be taken,"" the home ministry said in a public notice issued on Monday.At the same time, the ministry left a window open for NGOs unable to receive or utilise foreign contributions in the specified three and four year validity period, respectively, for genuine reasons. It said an extension may be allowed in the validity period for an association/organisation ""on a case-to-case basis, based on the merits of the case"". Until now, the validity of 'prior permission' granted under FCRA was co-terminus with the duration of the specific projects or activities for which the foreign contribution was obtained and that too from the specified source. A fresh 'prior permission' would need to be sought to receive foreign contributions for another project/purpose or if the funding was to be accepted from a new source.In the notice, the ministry said the central govt, in exercise of powers conferred under Section 46 of FCRA, 2010, has directed that the validity period for receiving foreign contribution shall be three years from the date of approval of the application for prior permission.The ministry clarified for 'prior permission' applications which have already been approved and where the remaining period of the approved project/activity in the prior permission is more than three years, the above time limit shall be reckoned from date of issue of this order - April 7, 2025.","The centre has put a three-year limit on ngos and associations working on specific projects to receive foreign funds.

'Cops planted evidence': SC acquits death row convict after a decade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cops-planted-evidence-sc-acquits-death-row-convict-after-a-decade/articleshow/120077459.cms,"There is no semblance of satisfactory evidence: Court

NEW DELHI: A botched investigation by police, which also ""planted"" evidence, and lopsided proceedings by the trial court sent a man to the gallows in a rape-cum murder case of a child in Uttarakhand. After a decade in jail under the shadow of death, Supreme Court not only quashed his sentence but also acquitted him.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta, after examining all evidence, including the forensic report, did not find even a single piece of credible evidence against the man and pulled up the state police as well as the trial court for the way in which the investigation and prosecution were carried out. The court quashed his conviction by both the trial court as well as high court.The incident occurred in Udham Singh Nagar district in June 2016 when the girl disappeared during a jagran and her body was found in a nearby field. The man was arrested a day later. The bench said when the FIR was lodged, none of the witnesses claimed to have seen the girl with the man, who was in charge of sound and light at the jagran, but they subsequently alleged so when police made him an accused.It also said the doctor who examined the girl was not cross-examined and he also did not disclose the name of the policeman to whom the samples were handed over nor did he state that the samples were sealed and were handed over in a secure condition. The court said police tried to stick the case on the man by getting his confessional statement.""After being arrested, the appellant confessed to the crime and stated that the clothes which he was wearing at the time of commission of the offence were placed by him in a bag which he was carrying in his hand. He had also stated that he was intending to throw the clothes but before he could do so, he was caught by police. We feel that the theory put forward in the testimony of the said witness... is totally unbelievable. It is clear as daylight that these recoveries have been planted because it is hard, if not impossible, to believe that the appellant, who was a free bird and had ample opportunity to destroy the clothes, would keep the same with him for almost two days after the incident so as to facilitate police to recover the same at a later point of time,"" the bench said.It said there was not even a ""semblance of evidence"" on record to satisfy the court that the samples collected from the girl's body and those collected from the man, which were later forwarded to the forensic science lab, were properly sealed or remained in a safe condition. ""There is every possibility of the samples being tampered/manipulated by the police officers to achieve a favourable result from FSL, thereby, inculpating the appellant in the crime,"" it added.The bench also found fault with trial proceedings as the accused was not properly represented. ""Thus, it is established beyond doubt that the trial was not conducted in a fair manner,"" it said.""The lopsided manner in which trial was conducted is fortified from the evidence of sub-inspector Prahlad Singh who was allowed to narrate the entire confession of the appellant in his examination-in-chief. This procedure adopted by the trial court in permitting a police officer to verbatim narrate the confession made by an accused during investigation is grossly illegal,"" tt said.",There is no semblance of satisfactory evidence: court.

"After tulip stroll with Rijiju, Waqf thorns sprout for Omar Abdullah",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-tulip-stroll-with-rijiju-waqf-thorns-sprout-for-omar-abdullah/articleshow/120073497.cms,"SRINAGAR: J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah went for morning walk Monday in Srinagar’s famed Tulip Garden with Union minister Kiran Rijiju, leading a prickly opposition in the assembly hours later to slam him over rejection of a motion to discuss the Waqf law while indulging in a stroll with the man who piloted it in Parliament.Two contrasting pictures played out. Union minority affairs minister Rijiju described his walk “amid vibrant hues” with Omar and his father, National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah, as “refreshing”. Hardly so, chorused People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and Peoples Conference as they slammed Omar in the assembly over laying out the “red carpet for the BJP minister who introduced the Waqf bill meant to disempower and debilitate Muslims”.The assembly witnessed prolonged shouting matches after Speaker Abdul Rahim Rather -- who is from NC -- rejected the adjournment motion brought by nine legislators to discuss the Waqf (Amendment) Act. These included eight NC members.Rather pointed out that the Waqf (amendment) bill had now become law with the President giving consent. Also, the law has been challenged in the Supreme Court and assembly rules prohibit debates on a sub-judice issue, the Speaker contended.But NC legislator Tanvir Sadiq, who moved the adjournment motion, cited precedents where laws passed by Parliament were discussed in assemblies across the country. Punjab and Rajasthan assemblies had discussed farm bills, Sadiq said. PDP’s Waheed Parra weighed in, saying Tamil Nadu assembly recently discussed the Waqf law.BJP legislators thumped tables, applauding the Speaker. NC legislators waved black bands, railing against the Waqf Act as a “black law” and raising Allahu Akbar slogans. BJP MLAs chanted Jai Shri Ram.PDP president and former CM Mehbooba Mufti accused NC of “meekly surrendering before the BJP” “It’s disappointing that the Speaker has rejected the Waqf motion. Despite securing a strong mandate, the (NC) govt appears to have completely yielded to BJP’s anti-Muslim agenda, cynically attempting to appease both sides,” Mehbooba alleged.She stressed that “the NC could learn” from Tamil Nadu’s DMK govt and the way in which it firmly opposed the Waqf bill. “In J&K, the only Muslim-majority region, it’s alarming that a supposedly people-centric govt lacks the courage even to debate this critical issue,” Mehbooba added. Mehbooba’s daughter Iltija Mufti echoed the views.Sajad Lone of People’s Conference hit out at Omar over the garden walk, saying the CM of the only Muslim-majority region in India should have stayed away from Rijiju. “Instead, he tagged along Farooq sahib as well. What a shame,” Lone said.Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, chairman of All Parties Hurriyat Conference, stressed the contrast with Tamil Nadu. “Tamil Nadu, which only has 6% Muslim population, passed a strong anti-Wakf resolution in its assembly. The assembly Speaker of Muslim majority-J&K is struggling and refusing by hiding behind technicalities to discuss it,” Mirwaiz said.",J&k chief minister omar abdullah went for morning walk in srinagar’s famed tulip garden with union minister kiran rijiju. Opposition slammed omar over laying out the “red carpet for the bjp minister who introduced the waqf bill meant to disempower and debilitate muslims”,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120073496,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1429651,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

'Will do everything to restore your dignity'

Bengal board moves SC seeking 'modification' of order

NEW DELHI: It is BJP versus Mamata Banerjee once again in battleground West Bengal. Months after the fierce faceoff over the R G Kar incident, the bitter political rivals are back on the streets - this time over the school jobs case as they try to corner each other over the loss of jobs of 25,753 teachers and staffers in state-run and aided schools in West Bengal.On April 3, a bench of Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar found that the West Bengal School Service Commission's selection process of 2016 was based on large-scale manipulations and fraud.""In our opinion, this is a case wherein the entire selection process has been vitiated and tainted beyond resolution. Manipulations and frauds on a large scale, coupled with the attempted cover-up, have dented the selection process beyond repair and partial redemption. The credibility and legitimacy of the selection are denuded"", the apex court bench stated in its judgement.While the BJP has gone all out to corner the Trinamool government for the mess, Mamata has been quick to unleash a counter offensive. “Was there some sort of game behind the verdict? Who had played the game from behind?” the chief minister questioned while addressing a gathering of job losers at Netaji Indoor Stadium in central Kolkata on Monday afternoon. In a bid to woo the affected teachers, the Trinamool chief also made an emotional pitch as she announced that she would continue fighting for the sacked teachers as long as she is alive - even if it meant going to the jail.In a clear message to the opposition, Banerjee alleged that a “dirty game” was being played to destroy the state's education system. “A dirty game is being played by some people. One should figure out the real faces behind the masks. Many are trying to mislead people with false information,” she said.Without naming the party, Mamata lashed out at senior advocate and CPM leader Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya for initiating the legal proceedings that culminated in the Supreme Court verdict.This as the BJP MLAs mounted pressure on Mamata and accused her TMC government of corruption. Leader of opposition in state assembly Suvendu Adhikari accused Mamata's nephew of taking a bribe of Rs 700 crore.""Mamata Banerjee should go to jail. She is the main beneficiary. Her nephew took a bribe of Rs 700 crore,"" the BJP leader said at a protest of party MLAs.Bengal BJP leader and Union minister of state for education Sukanta Majumdar accused Mamata of ruining the state's education system and demanded that she be jailed. ""Mamata Banerjee has ruined the education system of West Bengal. The next 10 generations will suffer and Mamata Banerjee is responsible for this and she should be put behind bars,"" the BJP leader said.""So many people have lost their jobs. Who is responsible for this? It is Mamata Banerjee and her Cabinet. Did she ever admit that her leaders were the ones who were doing the corruption? If she were sincere, she should have thrown out those who were involved in corruption. But you are involved in this, that is why you are trying your best to save them,"" he said.Aware of the adverse fallout of the BJP's campaign, Mamata has assured full support to eligible candidates who lost school jobs and asserted that her government will ensure they don't remain jobless or have a break in service.The chief minister urged the affected teachers and staff to return to their respective schools and “voluntarily” resume duties. She assured the aggrieved teachers that she would make alternative arrangements for all deserving candidates “within two months”.“You can return to your schools and voluntarily resume teaching. You are still in service since no termination letter has been served to you yet. Our government is duty-bound to ensure that no deserving candidate loses a job. We have plans ready to ensure that the eligible candidates do not face any break in service. We will not allow them to remain jobless,” Banerjee said at the meeting at the Netaji Indoor Stadium here, where thousands of affected teachers had turned up.“I will stand by those who lost their jobs in an unjust manner. I don't care what others think. I will do everything to restore your dignity,” Mamata added.Banerjee appealed to the aggrieved teachers to “trust” the government in doing its job, and said there should be no face-offs between the “deserving” and “tainted” candidates.The chief minister also claimed that her name was being dragged into something about which she had “no inkling”, referring to discrepancies in the school job appointments. “I am ready to even go to jail if anyone wants to penalise me for standing with those who lost school jobs,” Banerjee asserted.“One should figure out the real faces from the masks because many are now trying to mislead people with false information. There is a conspiracy to break the entire education system. A dirty game is being played by some people,"" she said, in an apparent reference to the opposition BJP and the CPM.However, not all were convinced with Mamata's assurances. Some of them expressed dissatisfaction and claimed that no concrete guarantees were provided regarding reinstatement of their jobs.Meanwhile, the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education (WBBSE) moved the Supreme Court on Monday seeking 'modification' in its order annulling over 25,000 jobs in schools last week, a high-level source in the education department said here.In an appeal to the apex court, the Board's lawyer requested that either ""deserving"" candidates be allowed to attend their duties till the end of this academic year, or till a fresh recruitment process as directed by the court is completed, whichever is earlier, the source said.With assembly elections in the state next year, the opposition, especially the BJP, will continue to raise the pitch on behalf of the affected teachers. However, unlike the R G Kar incident when Mamata took a long time to meet with the protesting doctors, the Trinamool chief this time around appears to be more proactive in trying to ensure that the BJP does not steal the advantage and put her on the dock once again.(With inputs from agencies)","The bitter political rivals are back on the streets over the school jobs case.

NEW DELHI: Chaos erupted at Sadaqat Ashram, the Bihar Congress office in Patna, following Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi's visit for a party function. Party workers drove away an individual, calling him thief and 'BJP agent.'The incident occurred on Monday at Sadaqat Ashram, where Rahul had stopped as part of his day-long tour that included a march in Begusarai and a symposium in Patna. While Rahul's visit to the venue lasted approximately 30 minutes, a video clip emerged of Congress workers chasing a man out of the office premises.After Rahul left, journalists noticed a young man carrying a pamphlet expressing support for the wakf bill. The man identified himself as ""Ram Babu Yadav, a native of Bhojpur district.""""He is a BJP agent, who has been sent here in exchange for money,"" alleged party workers as they forced Yadav out of the premises, labelling him as '' and ''.Later, one of the quarreling persons told reporters, ""I am a Congress supporter by birth. I am a Panchayat member. The one who was trading blows with me is an ex-MLA who is actually a BJP agent.""Former state president and Rajya Sabha MP Akhilesh Prasad Singh also got into the altercation, reportedly slapping a Congress worker on his way out.Two party workers blocked Singh's way while he was trying to reach his car. Singh stopped the fight by slapping one of them before leaving in his car.Rahul's day-long tour included multiple engagements across Bihar, including participation in a march at Begusarai and attending a symposium in Patna before concluding at the Congress headquarters.On his third visit to Bihar in four months, Rahul participated in the ""palayan roko, naukri do"" march in Begusarai, addressing unemployment and migration issues. Though he didn't speak publicly there, he was accompanied by numerous young supporters wearing white T-shirts, reminiscent of the ""Bharat Jodo Yatra"".At the ' Samvidhan Suraksha Sammelan ', Rahul said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had established a structure where 5% of the population governs the country, with 10-15 individuals controlling the corporate sector. Speaking at a symposium in the state capital before the assembly polls, he addressed the Congress alliance with RJD and the Left, which aims to challenge the ruling NDA.""I must be the first person in the Congress to admit that we did not work, in Bihar, with the zeal we should have. But we shall move forward learning from our mistakes. Our party, and the coalition of which we are a part, shall strive for uplift of SCs, STs, OBCs, extremely backward classes and minorities,"" said the Congress leader, noting his party's decline in Bihar since the 1990s Mandal wave.""We recently did something which may not have been great but was still of significance.

The CJI, however, stuck to the 'no mentioning for urgent listing' rule but said the petitions would be listed soon, likely by Friday.Detailing its objections to the amendments made to 2013 Waqf Act, the Kerala outfit said the changes ""display a patent discrimination against Muslims, based on religion, ousting them from carrying out meaningful administration of an entity that is a creation of their very religion.""Inclusion of non-Muslims in the Central Waqf Council and the Board of Auqaf exhibited a ""deep lack of trust on part of legislators"" in all-Muslim council and board to carry out duties and functions of the two bodies, it said.Criticising the provision allowing collectors to inquire into the nature of waqf property to determine if it is govt land, the Kerala body said this created a situation where the government became ""a judge in its own cause,"" and that expecting fairness from such an inquiry was ""bleak and remote.""DMK MP A Raja, who was part of the JPC on the waqf bill, argued the changes violated the fundamental rights of the Muslim community.Madani's petition, filed through Fuzail Ahmad Ayyubi, sought deferment of amended Act's implementation, calling it destructive of the centuries-old waqf tradition.AIMPLB said the changes reflected the govt's intention to wrest control of administration of waqf in breach of the minority community's constitutional rights, under Articles 25 and 26, to manage their own endowments. It said the requirement of a person to be a practising Muslim for five years to become a waqif (donor) was violative of Article 14 (right to equality - no member of other faiths is subjected to such condition), and Islamic Shariah principles.","Dmk, maulana arshad madani of jamiat ulama-e-hind, the all india muslim personal law board, and samastha kerala jamiathul ulema.

Can arrange for jobs in other depts: Mamata

KOLKATA: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said on Monday that she was willing to risk jail to throw a lifeline to all ""eligible"" teaching and non-teaching employees of state-run schools whose jobs were on the line after Supreme Court's verdict last week on the SSC recruitment scam .She pledged to regularise these jobs within two months, assuring the affected employees at a meeting that she had a ""Plan A"" and ""Plan B"" ready, just in case.""Let SC clarify and give us the list of eligible and ineligible candidates. No one has the right to dismantle the education system. Who'll run these schools? My request is, do not take away jobs if you can't provide them. The education dept will do what is necessary,"" she said.I know I can be jailed for saying this, but I don't care. Standing with people in distress is my prime concern,"" she said , addressing a 7,000-strong gathering here, and advising those affected by the SC verdict to ""voluntarily"" continue working in their respective schools till they received termination notices. The CM said the Trinamool govt would ensure no ""eligible"" teacher or non-teaching staffer was affected by a ""service break"".""We will take whatever alternative action is necessary even if the verdict does not go in our favour. The process will be completed within two months; your service will not be interrupted and you will receive additional concessions,"" Mamata told them. ""We can arrange for jobs in other departments,"" she said without elaborating on the proposal. The CM said the School Service Commission would first seek a clarification from SC before filing a review petition for ""a modification of the verdict"".""We need to know what the court's explanation is before we conduct a fresh recruitment exam. There is no need for secrecy. We will act in accordance with law. We are bound by the SC ruling and are taking proactive steps to ensure that the situation is handled with utmost care and fairness...I have studied law and whatever I am saying is within the ambit of law."" The Bengal govt is in talks with a battery of senior SC advocates - Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Kapil Sibal, Rakesh Dwivedi, Kalyan Banerjee and Prashant Bhushan - to safeguard the rights of ""eligible"" teachers, the CM said.A liaison committee, including representatives of the affected school staff, will coordinate with the legal team. State education minister Bratya Basu met some school staffers later to set up the liaison committee.Mamata's speech was disrupted several times by members of the audience. She immediately sought to placate them. ""Let us first resolve the issue of 'eligible' teachers. Then I will review the evidence against those labelled 'ineligible'. Don't fight among yourselves till then; have faith in me,"" she said.The CM blamed CPM and BJP for the plight of those facing joblessness for no fault of theirs. ""Why did Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya (lawyer and CPM MP) file a case? Answers must be given. CPM must respond to this,"" she said.Mamata also referred to the Vyapam scam in BJP-governed Madhya Pradesh and the dismissal of around 10,000 teachers in Tripura during CPM's stint in govt there. ""Not a single teacher has been reinstated despite BJP's election manifesto promise to give back their jobs,"" she said.","Bengal cm mamata banerjee said she was willing to risk jail to throw a lifeline to all ""eligible"" teaching and non-teaching employees.

According to the prosecution, Gupta and Kropha did not check applications in terms of coal ministry guidelines, which was a major lapse.The prosecution also alleged that they deliberately overlooked apparent discrepancies and changes in application format to favour the company. They did so despite the company claiming net worth of 28 group companies, whereas the guidelines made no mention of group firms, the prosecution alleged.Advocate Rahul Tyagi, appearing for Gupta and Kropha, countered the arguments and said they took all steps required to fairly carry out the allocation of coal blocks. Meanwhile, another court of special judge Arun Bhardwaj discharged former CBI additional legal adviser K Sudhakar, former RS MP Vijay Darda and son, and former junior Union coal minister Santosh Bagrodia from charges of corruption and criminal conspiracy in coal block allocations.","A delhi court has discharged former coal secretary hc gupta and ex-joint secretary k s kropha in a coal scam case.

Her father found her body from a haystack and lodged a police complaint on May 27, 2009.The trial court convicted the accused for rape and murder in Dec 2012 and awarded death sentence. Allahabad HC scrutinised evidence afresh and in 2022, upheld the conviction but reduced the punishment to imprisonment for rest of his life. On appeal, an SC bench of Justices A S Oka, Ahsanuddin Amanullah and A G Masih on Dec 2, 2024, acquitted the man, saying he was not given proper legal assistance during trial, which prejudiced his right to defence.The goat-herder parents of the 10-year-old would not understand the intricacies of the legal procedure.

He urged J&K govt to take positive steps for compassionate appointment of 12-year-old Yuvraj Singh, son of selection grade constable Jaswant Singh who lost his life in the line of duty, when he attains adulthood.Earlier in the day, Shah flew to BSF outpost ‘Vinay’ near the International Border in the Hiranagar sector of Kathua, where BSF director general Daljit Singh Chaudhary, J&K DGP Nalin Prabhat and other senior officers received him. The outpost is named after assistant commandant Vinay Prasad, who was hit by a sniper shot when he and his patrol party were out on a border domination exercise along the International Border on Jan 15, 2019.Shah’s visit comes at a time when security forces have been engaged in an intensive operation in Kathua over the past fortnight against a group of terrorists that is believed to have recently infiltrated from across the border.Shah also inaugurated newly built facilities at the border, including eight women barracks and high-mast lights.Praising the border guarding force’s glorious history, he said: “The entire nation knows that the BSF is our first line of defence, and the force has always performed this responsibility exceptionally well… In every war with Pakistan, the contribution of our BSF soldiers has been as significant as that of the Army.”On Monday evening, Shah, accompanied by LG Manoj Sinha, landed at the Srinagar airport, where CM Omar Abdullah received him. Shah visited the family of DSP Humayun Bhat, 32, one of four officers killed in an encounter with terrorists in south Kashmir’s Kokernag on Sept 13, 2023.In view of Shah’s visit, tight security arrangements are in place across the Kashmir Valley.
