His brother Malik Asif Naseer, a Pakistan-trained terrorist of LeT, was killed by forces in 2018. Malik, however, continued his terror activities, using his cover as a constable to avoid suspicion. His LeT link was exposed in Sept 2021 when cops found him to be helping LeT drop arms, explosives & narcotics, guided by GPS, at pre-shared coordinates facilitated by him to his Pakistani handlers.Ahmed was recruited as a teacher in 2011 but led a double life as a terror associate of Hizb in Poonch region.

Centre OKs 85% quota for locals in jobs in Ladakh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-oks-85-quota-for-locals-in-jobs-in-ladakh/articleshow/121607045.cms,"Ladakh Autonomous Council to reserve 33% of seats for women

NEW DELHI: Conceding the longstanding demands of Ladakhi people for safeguarding their economic rights as well as cultural and linguistic identity, the Centre on Tuesday introduced new reservation and domicile policy for the Union Territory, guaranteeing 85% quota to locals in jobs while also reserving one-third seats for women in the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Councils.English, Hindi, Urdu, Bhoti and Purgi languages were notified as official languages of Ladakh, with new regulation also requiring boosting institutional mechanisms for promoting native languages like Shina (Dardic), Brokskat (Dardic), Balti and Ladakhi.Centre's move seeks to assuage the sentiments of Ladakh's native population that had been demanding constitutional safeguards to protect their language, culture and land after the special status of the erstwhile state of J&K, which included Ladakh, under Article 370 was abrogated in 2019, and Ladakh hived off into a separate Union Territory. Though short of their demand for Ladakh's inclusion in Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, the 85% reservation for local Ladakhis in govt jobs and seats in professional institutions, was worked out in consultations held by a high-powered committee led by junior home minister Nityanand Rai, with civil society organisations from Ladakh.The safeguards for Ladakh finally implemented on Tuesday, are contained in a set of three separate regulations promulgated by the President of India on Monday.The UT of Ladakh Reservation (Amendment) Bill Regulation, 2025 amends provisions of the parent J&K Reservation Act, 2004, to raise the cap on total reservation in jobs and professional institutions in Ladakh to 85%, excluding the 10% quota for economically weaker sections.The Ladakh Civil Services Decentralisation and Recruitment (Amendment) Regulation, 2025, defines the conditions for domicile status: anyone who has resided in Ladakh for 15 years, or who has studied for seven years and appeared in Class 10 or 12 examination in a school located in UT, or whose parents are central govt officers who served in UT for 10 years. Children or spouses of Ladakhis fulfilling the 15-year domicile condition will also get domicile status. The procedure for grant of domicile certificate, notified in a separate set of rules, makes tehsildar the competent authority to issue domicile certificates; an officer appointed by the UT administrator will do the same for the children of central govt officers with 10-year service in Ladakh.The Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Councils (LAHDC) Regulation 2025, notified on Tuesday, states that ""not less than one-third of the total number of seats in the council shall be reserved for women and such seats may be allotted by rotation to different territorial constituencies"". The move is in line with spirit of the Nari Shakti Vandan Act, which provides for 33% quota to women in Lok Sabha and state assemblies.Ladakh has two autonomous hill development councils - one each for Leh and Kargil.Centre had assured a delegation from Ladakh in Dec 2023 that it was committed to fast-tracking the development of UT and meeting aspirations of the people in the region. Subsequently, an HPC for Ladakh was constituted under Nityanand Rai. In Aug 2024, Centre created five new districts in Ladakh - Zanskar, Drass, Sham, Nubra and Changthang.","Ladakh autonomous council to reserve 33% of seats for women.

"AAP disengages from INDIA bloc, says alliance was only for 2024 LS polls",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aap-disengages-from-india-bloc-says-alliance-was-only-for-2024-ls-polls/articleshow/121605557.cms,"NEW DELHI: AAP on Tuesday disengaged itself from the INDIA bloc, saying the opposition grouping was formed only for the 2024 Lok sabha polls. It also alleged BJP and Congress had entered a “secret, corrupt deal”.The statement came as Congress and 15 other opposition parties wrote to PM Narendra Modi demanding a special session of Parliament on developments following the Pahalgam terror attack. AAP made the same demand separately.AAP national media in-charge Anurag Dhanda said on X , “The real alliance is between BJP and Congress behind the scenes. Rahul Gandhi says only that which benefits Modi politically. In return, Modi saves the Gandhi family from going to jail. Neither of them is interested in providing basic facilities like schools, hospitals, electricity and water to the countrymen.”“To clean Indian politics, we must end this behind-the-scenes collusion. Rahul Gandhi and Modi may appear as opponents on stage but the truth is that they’ve become guarantees of each other’s political survival. Congress’s weak politics empowers BJP, and BJP’s rule hides Congress’s corruption,” Dhanda alleged in a statement issued by the party later.Asserting that the INDIA bloc was formed specifically for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Dhanda said, “The alliance ensured that opposition parties secured 240 seats – this is a significant achievement.” He drove home the point that the alliance as far as AAP had lived its purpose and the party was not part of the bloc anymore. “AAP will contest every state election on its own. We will be contesting all seats in Bihar later this year, “ Dhanda told TOI.“In Parliament, however, our MPs will support the opposition’s position based on what is best for the country and our MPs will vote accordingly in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha,” Dhanda said.AAP and Congress have had a turbulent equation even as INDIA bloc partners. After much to and fro on seat sharing talks and much resistance to the alliance from the Congress’s Delhi unit, the two parties finally did fight as allies in Delhi and also in Gujarat and Haryana in the Lok Sabha polls but were pitted against each other in Punjab.Later last year, the two parties failed to reach a consensus on seat-sharing in the Haryana assembly polls and fought against each other. In the Delhi assembly elections earlier this year too both parties fought a bitter battle that had put a big question mark on how both AAP and Congress would carry off as allies in the INDIA bloc.","The statement came as congress and 15 other opposition parties wrote to pm narendra modi demanding a special session of parliament on developments following the pahalgam terror attack.

Impeachment motion against Allahabad High Court judge Yashwant Varma in Monsoon session,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/impeachment-motion-against-allahabad-high-court-judge-yashwant-varma-in-monsoon-session/articleshow/121601764.cms,"Justice Varma

NEW DELHI: The Centre set to introduce an impeachment motion against Allahabad High Court Judge Justice Yashwant Varma in the upcoming Monsoon Session of Parliament, expected to commence in mid-July.Govt sources on Tuesday confirmed motion to be introduced in the upcoming session.The move follows a Supreme Court-appointed inquiry panel’s indictment of Justice Varma over allegations of unaccounted cash discovered at his official residence in Delhi after a fire on March 14, 2025.Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju is set to hold consultations with all political parties to build consensus for the unprecedented motion, which, if passed, would mark the first-ever impeachment of a High Court judge in India.Govt sources said that there is a process of forming a panel to investigate the charges against the accused judge before an impeachment motion. However, that formality is not needed since the Supreme Court has already completed the exercise.The controversy erupted when emergency services, responding to the fire at Justice Varma’s residence, recovered a substantial amount of burnt currency notes, reportedly stacked as high as 1.5 feet in a storeroom.A three-member panel, constituted by then-Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna on March 22, 2025, and comprising Justices Sheel Nagu, G S Sandhawalia, and Anu Sivaraman, found credence in the allegations of misconduct.The panel’s report, submitted on May 4, stated that Justice Varma failed to explain the source of the cash, deeming the misconduct serious enough to warrant impeachment proceedings.Justice Varma, who was transferred from the Delhi High Court to the Allahabad High Court following the incident, has denied the allegations, calling them a conspiracy. Despite the Supreme Court’s recommendation to resign, he has refused, prompting the government to initiate the impeachment process.Under the Constitution of India and the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, an impeachment motion requires the support of at least 100 Lok Sabha or 50 Rajya Sabha members to be tabled. It must then pass with a two-thirds majority in both Houses. The government, keen on ensuring bipartisan support, has tasked Minister Rijiju with engaging opposition parties, including the Congress, TMC, and DMK, to back the motion.The Allahabad High Court Bar Association has welcomed the move, emphasizing the need to uphold public trust in the judiciary.The case has sparked debates on judicial accountability and the balance of power between the judiciary and the executive. Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar stressed the importance of legal due process, stating, “Judicial independence must not preclude accountability.”",The centre set to introduce an impeachment motion against allahabad high court judge justice yashwant varma.

SRINAGAR: Farooq Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti and J&K LG Manoj Sinha joined hundreds of Kashmiri Pandits Tuesday at Mela Kheer Bhawani, an annual fair at an eponymous shrine in Ganderbal’s Tulmulla, marking the largest gathering since the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack and raising hopes of the displaced community’s return to the Valley.LG Sinha interacted with people and extended warm greetings on the occasion. The shrine is known as Kheer Bhawani as devotees offer milk and(milk pudding) to a sacred spring there which, the legend has it, changes colour. Pandits from across the country travel to the temple fair, around 35km from Srinagar, each year.“Devotees in large numbers is a good sign. I think after the heinous (Pahalgam) terror attack on April 22, it is the first time that people in such large numbers have assembled at one place in Kashmir. May Mata Kheer Bhawani keep showering her blessings on J&K people,” Sinha said, vowing to make the pilgrimage safe and hassle-free.Sinha also announced that preparations were in full swing for the annual Amarnath Yatra this year from July 3 to Aug 9. “We have made all arrangements for the security of yatris. I request pilgrims from across the country to come for the yatra,” Sinha said.PDP president Mehbooba cited the large Pandit throngs at Kheer Bhawani temple to reiterate her belief that guns were not the solution to Kashmir’s issues.“Kashmir issue cannot be resolved through military force or militants’ guns. Political solution is the only way forward. There should be a political process. That process cannot be completed until our Kashmiri Pandit brothers and sisters return with due respect and settle in the Valley,” Mehbooba said.Farooq, president of J&K’s governing National Conference (NC), echoed the views as he was greeted warmly at the fair. He stressed the “urgent” need for return and resettlement of Pandits in the Valley, calling for land as well as proper housing facilities. He recalled that NC had during its past stints in office attempted such rehabilitation and expressed hope the situation would improve enough for Pandits to live in Kashmir as they once did.Kheer Bhawani temple was built by then monarch Pratap Singh in 1912. The spring there has held religious sanctity for Pandits over centuries, with many claiming its origin to Lord Rama’s times.","Hundreds of kashmiri pandits gathered at mela kheer bhawani, an annual fair at an eponymous shrine in ganderbal’s tulmulla.

Amit Kumar Singal, a 2007-batch IRS officer serving as Additional Director General at the Directorate of Taxpayer Services, was arrested alongside his associate Harsh Kotak in connection with an alleged bribe of Rs 25 lakh.CBI officials confirmed on Monday that raids at Singal’s residences in Delhi and Punjab led to the seizure of approximately Rs 1 crore in cash, 3.5 kg of gold, and 2 kg of silver. The operation followed a complaint by Sanam Kapoor, owner of La Pino’z Pizza, who alleged that Singal demanded a total of Rs 45 lakh to settle an income tax notice issued earlier this year.According to the complaint, Singal had leveraged his previous position as Joint Commissioner in the Customs Department, Mumbai, to establish business connections with Kapoor, including a franchise agreement via Parker Impex, a firm registered in his mother's name. Additional contracts were reportedly arranged with other firms linked to Kotak and his family.

TMC assault on BJP backers attack on democracy: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tmc-assault-on-bjp-backers-attack-on-democracy-sc/articleshow/121607037.cms,"'Cancellation of bail requires a higher threshold than grant of bail'

NEW DELHI: Coming down heavily on Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers for targeting Hindu families and their women for supporting BJP during the 2021 assembly elections in alleged complicity with West Bengal police, Supreme Court has cancelled the bail granted to six TMC workers and said such incidents were ""grave attacks on the roots of democracy"".It allowed an appeal against Calcutta HC's orders granting bail to Sekh Jamir Hossain, Sekh Nurai, Sekh Ashraf, Sekh Karibul and Jayanta Done.A Supreme Court bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said, ""The concerted attack on the (Hindu) complainant's house was launched on the day of election results with the sole objective of wreaking vengeance because he had supported the saffron party. ""This is a grave circumstance which convinces us that the accused persons, including the respondents herein, were trying to terrorise members of the opposite political party whom the accused respondents were supporting. ""Aware that cancellation of bail requires a higher threshold than grant of bail, the bench said, ""Having regard to the facts enumerated above, we feel that the present one is a case wherein the allegations against the accused respondents are so grave that the same shake the conscience of the court.""Writing the judgment, Justice Mehta said, ""The reprehensible way the incident was perpetrated shows the vengeful attitude of the accused persons and their avowed objective to subdue supporters of the opposite party into submission by hook or by crook. The dastardly offence was nothing short of a grave attack on the roots of democracy.""The judgment recorded that the complainant's wife was viciously pulled by the hair and disrobed. The accused persons were about to assault her sexually when the woman gathered the courage to pour kerosene on herself and threatened self-immolation upon which the accused persons ran away, it said.Justices Nath and Mehta said, ""There is no possibility of a fair and impartial trial being conducted if the accused respondents are allowed to remain on bail. Thus, on both counts - nature and gravity of the offence which is nothing short of an attack on the roots of democracy, and the imminent likelihood of the accused adversely affecting a fair trial - the bail granted to the accused respondents must be cancelled.""This was the second time in recent days that attacks on Hindus by TMC members had the judiciary's attention and intervention. Earlier, a fact-finding team set up by Calcutta HC held that a party MLA and a corporator had identified houses of Hindus which were later targeted by a violent mob protesting against the new waqf law in Murshidabad. Two people were killed in the attack.Asking the trial court to conclude the trial within six months, SC directed the West Bengal home secretary and the director general of police to ensure that proper protection was provided to the complainant and all witnesses so that they could freely appear and depose at the trial. The SC warned that if any violation of these directions was reported by the CBI, it would take suitable action. Immediately after the 2021 assembly elections, in the Muslim majority village of Gumsima, TMC workers wreaked vengeance on a Hindu family for supporting BJP. The head of the family had earlier lodged a police complaint that he was not being allowed to carry out his religious rituals.The evening after election results were declared on May 2, 2021, an armed mob of 40-50 people led by Sekh Mahim threw bombs at the Hindu family's house, looted belongings and disrobed the complainant's wife and molested her. The mob relented only when she poured kerosene on herself and threatened self-immolation. The entire family fled the village to save their lives and dignity.On May 3, 2021, the family approached Sadaipur police station to lodge a complaint. The officer-in-charge did not accept the complaint and advised the complainant to leave the village to save himself and his family. Several similar complaints were not recorded by the police. Calcutta HC on Aug 19, 2021, ordered CBI to investigate all such cases involving rape, murder or attempt to commit such offences. CBI had registered cases in Dec 2021.","Supreme court has cancelled the bail granted to six tmc workers.

In the same breath, she mentioned she would not waste time with accused appellant and needed to 'invest on the next victim'. She also said she would irritate her victims to the extent that they dump her, so she could happily start with the next one,"" the bench noted.The court said the chats revealed a consistent pattern that supported the man's claim of being falsely implicated, and quashed the criminal proceedings against him.","Supreme court quashes rape charges against a man who had a consensual physical relationship with a 30-year-old woman. The court observed her ""aggressive sexual behaviour, obsessive nature, and manipulative & vindictive tendencies"" justice mehta said allowing the man's prosecution would amount to a gross abuse of legal process.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121606996,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1445950,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Three child marriages foiled in a month in Jind; officials step in to protect minors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/three-child-marriages-foiled-in-a-month-in-jind-officials-step-in-to-protect-minors/articleshow/121603113.cms,".

JIND: The district administration along with a NGO stopped three stopped three marriages in a month, in which all three couples were minors.In a fresh case, the district administration successfully intervened a child marriage at the local Vishwakarma Chowk area in Jind in which the bride and groom both were minors. The boy was 18 years old while the girl was 16-years old. This is the third child marriage prevented in a month in the Jind district.The first child marriage was stopped at Brahmanwas village on April 30, in which the groom’s age was 20 and bride was 17. In this case, the boy had been selected in a government job in postal department, and the bride’s father was poor, and following his financial condition, he fixed the marriage of his younger girl along with his elder daughter on the same day to save marriage expenses. The second marriage was prevented at Kharak Gadia village of this district on May 12, in which the groom’s age was 18 and the bride was 13, said officials.In the fresh case, it came to light that preparations were underway and the groom’s procession was ready to proceed to complete further marriage rituals at the bride’s house at Narnaund town of Hisar district. The team members apprised the groom’s mother, a widow, and guests of the strict provisions of the Child Marriage Act 2006.For some time, she tried to mislead in showing birth certificates of her son, but after strict warning from the team members, she produced the certificates in which it came to light that the he was 3 years shorter than marriageable age. After this, the birth certificates of the brides were also demanded on WhatsApp, and after verifying the documents, the bride was also found to be just 16 years old.Later, the groom's mother recorded her statement before the police that she was illiterate and unaware of the provisions of The Child Marriage Act 2006, said Surender Singh Mann, head of MDD, an NGO which was involved with district administration in all three marriages.Maan said that under the aegis of Just Rights for Children (JRC), a national platform of 250 civil societies working in 416 districts in the country, his organization was working against child marriage in 14 districts of Haryana , including Jind. He further said though different social reasons forced parents to tie the knot of their minor children but independent choices of brides and grooms totally ignored, as parents treat them as their private property, which is an injustice to them.","In a fresh case, the district administration successfully intervened a child marriage at the local vishwakarma chowk area in jind.

Investigations by the Tamil Nadu Directorate of Public Health and the Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore, revealed that the clinic had reused single-use medical equipment on multiple patients and adopted unsterile dental practices and thus infecting them, leading to their deaths.The dentist, however, changed the name of his clinic to ‘Arivu Hospital’ and continued to treat patients. A team led by joint director (health) Dr V Gnanameenakshi, raided the hospital after receiving a tip-off. The district officials sent a notice to the dentist Arivazhagan, demanding an explanation within three days after they found that the clinic had changed its name and continued to operate under a new identity.The notice also warned that legal action would be taken if a response was not provided.
