Jharkhand’s health minister Irfan Ansari is under fire over his alleged call to people to lock up booth-level officers when they visit homes during the special intensive revision of electoral rolls. Opposition parties in the state have condemned the remark and demanded his removal, while Election Commission has sought a report.Ansari, a Congress member, made the controversial statement on Sunday during a govt programme in Jamtara district. Following backlash, he clarified on Monday that his words were being misinterpreted by certain sections to “defame” him.In a video, which has gone viral, Ansari is heard asking people to lock up BLOs when they visit their homes and inform him.

Trial futile as public money is returning to banks: SC

NEW DELHI: In a first of its kind order to drop criminal proceedings in a multi-crore bank fraud case after the accused agreed to pay back the money, Supreme Court allowed fugitive Sandesara brothers - Nitin and Chetan of Sterling Biotech Ltd - and their associates to be let off after the Centre and Enforcement Directorate agreed to their proposal to pay Rs 5,100 crore as one-time settlement (OTS) to put quietus on the litigations with respect to cases by CBI, ED, SFIO and income tax department.The siblings have till Dec 17 to deposit the amount.Though the bench said its order should not be treated as a precedent, some in govt think it might have implications for cases involving fugitives such as Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya who can seek similar relief.A bench of Justices JK Maheshwari and Vijay Bishnoi in its November 19 judgment said continuation of criminal proceedings would not serve any useful purpose, considering that public money is coming back to lender banks.Centre, after consulting various agencies, which were pursuing cases against the Sandesaras, gave the figure of Rs 5,100 crore as OTS and the assurance that it will have no objection to quashing of criminal proceedings against the accused. ""In view of the foregoing, subject to deposit of Rs 5,100 crore as indicated towards full and final settlement with the lender banks and investigating agencies, these petitions deserve to be allowed granting the following reliefs - writ petitions filed by the petitioners are allowed directing quashing of proceedings...The quashing would be operative on deposit of Rs 5,100 crore as a full and final payment based on consensus, on or before Dec 17, 2025,"" the order said.""The litigation with respect to the loan amount of the petitioners for which FIR was registered and OTS was sanctioned and approved, shall be put to an end by way of full and final settlement as per consensus and this litigation shall be put to quietus. These directions as issued are in peculiar facts of this case, therefore, they shall not be treated as precedent,"" the order said. SC directed its registry to disburse the amount to the respective lender banks on proportionate basis.The willingness of Sandesara brothers also marks a success of agencies in choking their funds and leaving them with few options than to negotiate. Besides them, Chetan's wife Dipti and family member Hitesh Patel were also declared Fugitive Economic Offenders in Sept 2020. The four, including the Sandesara brothers, had pending non-bailable warrants against them and have been forced to move from country to country, including Nigeria, the UAE, the UK and the US to escape arrest since 2017, according to ED.Late Congress neta Ahmed Patel, political adviser to Sonia Gandhi, was among the dozens who were investigated for their alleged dealings with the Sandesaras. ED had attached more than Rs 14,500 crore of assets in this case, which included Rs 4,700 crore in India and over Rs 9,778 crore overseas, including oil rigs, ships, aircraft and properties in the US, the UK and other countries, an action that brought the Sandesaras under pressure.Govt's acceptance of the Sandesaras's offer is also for the fact that a large part of the attached assets are in foreign jurisdictions and were difficult to realise because most were paper attachments, and foreign countries were not cooperating with ED orders, sources said.They also said the Sandesaras owed over Rs 14,000 crore, including interest and penalties to banks, and banks have recovered almost Rs 3,500 crore through deposits by the fugitive siblings and by selling off properties worth Rs 1,100 crore through insolvency. After OTS, banks will have recovered Rs 8,600 crore - a good amount, considering that they very often take haircuts of up to 80% during insolvency proceedings.The bench noted that proceedings in the case from inception were focused on bringing back public money as the accused had agreed to pay back the amount.","Fugitive sandesara brothers nitin and chetan of sterling biotech ltd to be let off.

Of 16 management quota seats, 4 taken by EWS candidates

Almost 140 candidates from the economically weaker section (annual family income less than Rs 8 lakh) have chosen postgraduate seats in clinical specialties from management and NRI quotas of private medical colleges, for which tuition fees alone range from Rs 25 lakh to Rs 1 crore plus per year. This has raised questions about the credibility of EWS certificates.""They apply for PG NEET exam as EWS candidates and when their ranks turn out to be very low, they become NRIs and pay fees in crores or take management quota seats that can also cost more than Rs 1 crore for the entire course. This can happen only in India,"" said a postgraduate trainee doctor. This had happened last year too and yet there was no inquiry by govt into the issue of candidates with fake EWS certificates who affect the chances of deserving candidates, added the doctor.An EWS candidate whose NEET rank was lower than 1.1 lakh has taken an NRI quota seat for MD in dermatology in Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Belagavi, where the annual tuition fees for NRIs are over a crore per annum for this specialty. Another EWS candidate with a rank below 84,000 has opted for an NRI quota seat for MD in general medicine in Vinayaka Missions Medical College in Puducherry, for which the tuition fee is over Rs 55 lakh per year.Three EWS candidate have opted for postgraduate seats in Santosh Medical College in specialties such as radio diagnosis (Rs 76 lakh per year), general medicine and obstetrics and gynaecology, which cost Rs 50 lakh per year. Out of 16 management quota seats for postgraduation in general medicine in Dr DY Patil Medical College in Navi Mumbai, four have been taken by EWS candidates.

NEW DELHI: In a major crackdown on synthetic drug trafficking, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and Delhi Police’s special cell seized 329 kg of methamphetamine worth Rs 262 crore from a house in south Delhi’s Chattarpur on Nov 20. Two people were arrested.The joint exercise, codenamed Operation Crystal Fortress, was an intelligence-driven effort to dismantle a transnational drug network. Investigators believe the cartel is linked to a foreign-based kingpin who is also wanted in last year’s seizure of 83 kg cocaine in Delhi.Saying that the Centre “is shattering drug cartels at an unprecedented pace”, Union home minister Amit Shah called the operation “a brilliant example of seamless multi-agency coordination to achieve PM Modi’s vision for a drug-free India”.Officers in the know of things said that the breakthrough followed months of surveillance and technical intercepts that exposed a well-oiled cartel using multiple couriers, safe houses and layered handlers, with Delhi as a key hub for domestic and overseas distribution of drugs.One of the arrested suspects, Shane Waris (25), a resident of Amroha, Uttar Pradesh, was picked up from Noida’s Sector 5 on Nov 20. Employed as a sales manager in a company, Waris allegedly operated under instructions from his handler.He was directed to use fake SIM cards and encrypted apps, such as WhatsApp and Zangi, to discreetly run the operations.During interrogation, Waris admitted to his role in the syndicate and provided crucial leads to the investigators, including identifying a woman associate, Esther Kinimi from Nagaland, who recently managed one of the narcotic consignments transported through a rider of a logistics platform.Waris shared her address, contact numbers and other operational details with the investigators.Acting on Waris’ inputs, NCB personnel raided Kinimi’s Chattarpur Enclave Phase 2 residence the same day, recovering the massive consignment. She was arrested with assistance from Nagaland Police.Preliminary findings suggest that the syndicate was part of a larger cartel. “The investigation indicates Waris was actively involved in a synthetic drug trafficking syndicate functioning under foreign operators,” an officer said.Authorities are now working with international enforcement agencies to trace the kingpin and secure his deportation to India so that he could face legal proceedings.Further investigation is required to map the entire supply chain, financial trail, logistics nodes, and potential storage points, the officer said.This seizure is among the largest of methamphetamine in Delhi. The investigators said efforts are underway to dismantle the entire network and prevent its tentacles from spreading to overseas markets.","Ncb, delhi police crack down on transnational drug cartel, seize rs 262cr meth from city house.

Why? Why?’ Mamata Slams EC, Flags ‘Unusual & Alarming’ Moves Ahead of Bengal Polls

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday wrote to chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, raising concern over what she described as two “disturbing yet urgent developments” connected to the upcoming elections in the state. She questioned a centralised Request for Proposal issued by the chief electoral officer (CEO) for outsourcing data personnel and objected to a proposal to set up polling stations inside private residential complexes.In the letter, Banerjee said, “I am constrained to write to you regarding two disturbing yet urgent developments that have been brought to my notice, and which, in my view, warrant your immediate intervention.”Her first objection relates to what she called a “questionable RfP issued by CEO, West Bengal”.“It has recently come to light that the CEO, West Bengal, has directed District Election Officers (DEOs) not to engage contractual data entry operators and Bangla Sahyata Kendra (BSK) staff for SIR-related or other - `election-related data work. Simultaneously, the CEO's office has floated a Request for Proposal (RfP) for hiring 1,000 Data Entry Operators and 50 Software Developers for a period of one year.This raises serious concerns.”She argued that district offices already have enough qualified staff and are empowered to make their own arrangements.“When district offices already have a substantial number of competent professionals performing such functions, what necessitates the CEO's initiative to outsource the same work through an external agency for a full year? Traditionally, field offices have always hired their own contractual data entry personnel as per requirement. If there is an urgent need, DEOs are fully empowered to undertake such hiring themselves.Why, then, is the CEO's office assuming this role on behalf of field offices? What substantive difference is expected in the service conditions or contractual obligations between those already engaged and those to be hired through the proposed agency? Is this exercise being undertaken at the behest of a political party to serve vested interests?The timing and manner of this RfP certainly raise legitimate doubts.”On the second issue, Banerjee registered strong opposition to the idea of establishing polling stations inside private housing complexes.“It has further been brought to my attention that the Election Commission is considering setting up polling stations within private residential complexes, and DEOs have been asked to provide recommendations.This proposal is deeply problematic. Polling stations have always been-and must remain-located in government or semi-government institutions, preferably within a 2 km radius, to ensure accessibility and neutrality. Private buildings are typically avoided for clear reasons: they compromise faimess, violate established norms, and create discriminatory distinctions between privileged residents and the general public- the haves and have-nots.Why is such a move being contemplated at all? Again, is this being done under pressure'from a political party to advance their partisan. interests?Why? Why? Why?”Calling the implications far-reaching, she warned, “The implications of such a decision would have severe impact on the fairness of the electoral process.”Banerjee concluded by appealing for immediate action. “I urge you to examine these issues with utmost seriousness, impartiality, and transparency. It is essential that the dignity, neutrality, and credibility of the Commission remain above reproach and are not compromised under any circumstances.”",West bengal chief minister mamata banerjee wrote to chief election commissioner gyanesh kumar.

Nevertheless, he was offered the option to discontinue his SIR responsibilities if he so desired.The Chief Electoral Officer assured that all necessary support would be extended to him to ensure the smooth discharge of his duties,"" it added.This comes as several BLOs have either committed suicide or died unnaturally amid the ongoing SIR of electoral rolls in 12 states across India, including Kerala, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh.Meanwhile, booth-level officers scuffled with police personnel on Monday while trying to enter the CEO's office in Kolkata during a demonstration to protest against alleged excessive work pressure.According to a senior official, members of the BLO Adhikar Raksha Committee took out a procession from College Square in north Kolkata, carrying locks and fetters to symbolically close the main entrance of the building in which the office of the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) is housed.The protesting BLOs raised slogans against the Election Commission, alleging that they were forced to hold the procession as the ""poll panel did not respond to their complaints of intense and inhuman work pressure during the SIR exercise.""""BLOs have been directed to complete tasks within a short period, though the same work usually takes more than two years,"" a functionary claimed.The committee also alleged that BLOs were falling sick and that two of them died by suicide due to stress.Meanwhile, the TMC also attacked the Election Commission for conducting the exercise in a ""rushed, haphazard and opaque manner.""TMC MP Saket Gokhale urged the poll body to protect the booth-level officers, safeguard the rights of voters, and be transparent about the Special Intensive Revision process.""Is cruelty essential for doing SIR? Across Bengal and the rest of India, BLOs tasked with SIR are dying of exhaustion or by suicide. A process that should be given a few months is being hastily done in 30 days,"" Gokhale said.""We've been clear: we have no problem with the purpose of SIR, which is to clean up the voter list. We are, however, strongly opposed to the rushed, haphazard and opaque manner in which it is being done in Bengal,"" he said.""SIR duty should not be a death sentence for BLOs,"" he said, adding, ""SIR should not become a pretext for deleting legitimate voters.""Gokhale pointed out that the SIR was not done in Delhi, Haryana and Maharashtra, the three states that went to polls after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.""Why then is the ECI rushing to do it within 30 days in Bengal?"" he asked.He said the BLOs should be allowed to work without stress, and people should be given enough time to understand the process and locate their documents.""If the ECI is genuinely independent, it should protect BLOs, safeguard the rights of voters, and be transparent about the SIR process,"" he said.""But the actions of the ECI in Bengal show that ‘cleaning the voter list’ is just a facade. In reality, the way SIR is being done shows that the clear agenda is to create panic and rig the system to benefit the BJP,"" he added.","An audio recording of a booth level officer surfaced on social media, in which he expressed work-related stress.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Monday said that the ""pollution of Marx and Mao"" is denser in the brains of the agitators after slogans condemning Naxal commander Hidma's encounter were raised during a protest over rising air pollution levels in Delhi.During a press conference, BJP leader Sudhanshu Trivedi said that the ""real face"" of protestors was out soon as they started raising slogans in support of a slain Naxal commander.""Some people reached India Gate with a mask on their faces that they are there to protest against the pollution. The masks were off as soon as they reached there, and the real face was out, and they started raising slogans in support of a slain Naxal commander,"" the BJP leader said.He also latched on the incident to target Congress and claimed that the party ""dreams"" of coming to power with the support of the extremists.""The PM has said that the Congress has become the Muslim League-Maoist. More than the air pollution, the pollution of Marx and Mao is denser in their brains. Along with that, they dream of coming to power with the support of extremist 'Kathmullas'.

'We Fly For You': Russian Fighter Pilot's Heartfelt Note For Indian Tejas Pilot After Dubai Crash

SHIMLA: Wing Commander Namansh Syal, who perished in the Tejas crash at Dubai Air Show on Friday, was a high flyer all his life - house captain in Sainik School, Academy Cadet Adjutant (ACC) at National Defence Academy (NDA), and an instructor with Indian Air Force (IAF), training the next generation of combat pilots.The air warrior will be cremated at his ancestral village, Patialkar, in Kangra district's Nagrota Bagwan tehsil, on Sunday, his father Naib Subedar Jagan Nath (retd), an Army Medical Corps veteran, told TOI. In a tragic twist, the 71-year-old said he was searching for videos of his son's aerial acrobatics at the air show when news reports of the crash popped up. Speaking to TOI over phone from Sulur, the grief-stricken father said, ""Then, officers from my son's squadron arrived to convey the tragic news. ""When the family got the news, Namansh's wife, Wing Commander Afshan, was in Kolkata on a training course.

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Monday sent another 17 protesters to three-day judicial custody in connection with the November 23 demonstration at India Gate against rising air pollution levels, police said, as the total number of arrests linked to the protest rose to 22.Earlier today, Delhi Police arrested at least 15 people on charges of obstructing its personnel and assaulting them, besides blocking the road during a protest at the India Gate over rising air pollution levels in the national capital, an official told PTI.Officials said the group was detained for allegedly obstructing police personnel, assaulting them and blocking the road during the protest.According to Delhi Police, two FIRs have been registered, one at Sansad Marg police station and another at Kartavya Path police station, under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including those related to outraging the modesty of women.Police said the situation escalated on Sunday evening after a confrontation broke out while demonstrators were being removed from the site. “The situation then turned into a scuffle, and some protesters used pepper spray on our personnel, which is unusual and rare,” a police officer said. He added that the accused were produced before court on Monday.Authorities said the protest was held without permission at a non-designated site.“India Gate is not a designated protest site. The protesters were asked to leave. Jantar Mantar is the designated protest site, and anyone can demonstrate there after obtaining permission. On Sunday, the protesters blocked the C-Hexagon after jumping police barricades. They sat on the road for over an hour, and even people stuck in the traffic jam were requesting them to clear the way,” the officer said.He added that the protesters misbehaved with police. “Many police personnel sustained injuries during the scuffle and were rushed to RML Hospital for treatment. We are investigating the entire matter and checking CCTV footage to identify everyone involved,” he said.Police said they are also examining allegations that some protesters raised slogans in support of Maoist leader Madvi Hidma.Meanwhile, the Delhi Coordination Committee for Clean Air said the city’s worsening air quality has become a “serious risk” to public health. It alleged that the government is relying on “cosmetic measures” instead of addressing root causes, claiming PM2.5 levels have remained in the “severe” category.In a separate hearing, a Delhi court on Monday sent five students to two-day judicial custody in a related case registered at Kartavya Path police station over the alleged use of pepper spray on police officials during the protest. Judicial Magistrate Aridaman Singh Cheema also sent one accused to an observation home until age verification.The five students sent to judicial custody were identified as Akash, Ahan, Akshay, Sameer and Vishnu. Police have invoked sections 74, 115(2), 221 and 223 of the BNS for assault, causing hurt, obstruction of public servants and disobedience of lawful orders.","A delhi court on monday sent another 17 protesters to three-day judicial custody in connection with the november 23 demonstration at india gate.

Justice Surya Kant, Known For Article 370 Ruling And Pegasus Scrutiny, Takes Oath As India’s New CJI

Ex-HC CJ not in ambit of detailed in-house proceedings

NEW DELHI: Outgoing CJI B R Gavai disclosed Sunday that it was a high court chief justice who had attempted to influence a judicial member of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), Chennai, for a favourable order for a corporate entity, and that he narrowly escaped an in-house inquiry due to his retirement and other reasons.The CJI said he had sought a report from NCLAT judicial member Justice Sharad Kumar Sharma who had startled everyone by disclosing in open court on Aug 13 that ""one of the most revered members of the higher judiciary of this country"" had approached him to secure a favourable order and recused himself from hearing the case.The CJI said by the time Justice Sharma sent a detailed report, the HC chief justice in question had retired; thus, a formal in-house inquiry could not be ordered against the errant member of the judiciary.The CJI said that shortly after he initiated deliberations among his colleagues over the process or procedure to be adopted to weed out such attempts in future, the President appointed Justice Surya Kant as his successor to the post of CJI. ""That is why I thought it better to leave it to the new CJI to take appropriate action on the issue,"" he said.The retired HC CJ is out of the ambit of detailed in-house proceedings, an adverse finding in which could persuade the CJI to recommend govt to initiate a motion in Parliament for the judge's removal.However, he may not be completely out of the arc of accountability as the new CJI, Justice Surya Kant, could still recommend registration of FIR under Prevention of Corruption Act.On November 14, addressing the matter, a bench of CJI-designate Justice Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi had told advocate Prashant Bhushan, who was appearing for a petitioner, that ""action will have to be initiated at the highest level (of the judiciary, that is the CJI) against the one who attempted to interfere with the administration of justice. If Supreme Court takes up this issue on the judicial side, then it would run counter to the power vested in the highest authority. The highest authority cannot be guided by judicial orders to take a decision.""Noting the seriousness of the matter, the bench had said that under the existing legal framework for fixing accountability on constitutional court judges, the issue raised by the petitioner should be dealt with on the administrative side.","Outgoing cji b r gavai disclosed sunday that it was a high court chief justice who had attempted to influence a judicial member of the national company law appellate tribunal (nclat), chennai.

NEW DELHI: Chilli sprays, pro-Maoist posters and over 22 arrests characterised the anti-pollution protests in the national capital region on Sunday. The protests turned political, with the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders bringing the ""urban Naxals"" narrative to the demonstrations.Meanwhile, Aam Aadmi Party questioned the BJP-led Delhi government's ""inaction"" on the pollution as the air quality remained ""very poor"" in the region.People had also gathered at the same location on November 9, urging the government to enforce measures to reduce air pollution in the NCR.Visuals from the protests showed the demonstrators holding posters of Maoist commander Madvi Hidma, who was recently killed in an encounter.""A protest was held this evening at C Hexagon, India Gate, over pollution.

They mentioned ‘Jantana Sarkar’, but they have neither seen it themselves nor understood its real impact. They are kids; they will understand eventually. Still, they need to learn how democracy functions, how real governments are formed, what their purpose and existence are, and how they actually operate,"" he said.According to the Delhi Police, over 15 protesters were arrested after they allegedly refused to disperse during a demonstration against rising pollution at the C-Hexagon near India Gate. Police said the protesters obstructed official work, blocked the road, and, even more unusually, used chilli spray on police personnel.""Some of the protesters gathered inside the C-Hexagon and then tried to cross the barricade that we had put in place to restrict movement. However, they did not comply; they broke the barricade, came onto the road, and sat there...We requested them to move, as many ambulances and medical personnel were waiting behind them and required emergency access...We removed them from the C-Hexagon to avoid disrupting traffic. During the removal, several protesters scuffled with the police, and many of our personnel were injured,"" ANI quoted Devesh Kumar Mahla saying.An FIR was registered, and relevant sections were invoked for assaulting police officers, causing obstruction, and blocking public pathways.BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain slammed the demonstrators, calling them ""professional protesters"" for ""raising slogans in support of Hidma"".""They came claiming to protest against pollution, but that was not their real purpose. Those with a 'polluted mind' began raising slogans in support of Hidma. We have always said that urban Naxals are present in cities as well,"" he said.""In the forests, we have eliminated them, and whatever remains will also be finished. 'Professional protesters' always look for excuses against the government. Pollution was just a pretext - they aimed to promote Naxalism,"" he added.""Under the pretext of pollution, some Naxalite elements staged a protest at India Gate and openly violated every norm of democracy. While protesting, they raised pro-Naxal slogans and sprayed chilli spray directly into the eyes of the police personnel on duty. This clearly shows it was a pre-planned conspiracy in which they failed. Such acts can never be accepted in a democracy,"" said BJP MP Praveen Khandelwal.AAP leader Priyanka Kakkar, however, questioned the Delhi government, demanding ""emergency meeting"" to address the issue of pollution.""This is a national health emergency... The central government should act like a responsible government. It's been 10 months since they've been in Delhi. Have you heard a single step they've taken regarding pollution? Nothing at all,"" she said.""They should call a meeting with all the Chief Ministers and the Environment Ministers of the NCR, hold an emergency meeting, lay out certain plans, and take certain steps... This government is committing fraud with people's health.

It was DLTGH 50 (days left to go home) at National Defence Academy (NDA). Morning announcements at squadrons were now beginning with this cheerful count. Mid-term had passed. Termbreak — and home — were only a few weeks away when the Oct 10 morning muster in Charlie Squadron reported a missing firsttermer, Cadet Antriksh Kumar Singh.The 18-year-old was found dead in his cabin. It was the third suicide in NDA since 2014. The Lucknow boy had cleared Services Selection Board (SSB) in his first attempt and was by all accounts a very bright student. What drove him beyond the edge?Less than two weeks later, tragedy struck again. This time in the swimming pool. Bravo Squadron first-termer Aditya D Yadav, a weak swimmer, was being put through extra lessons to clear his mandatory test when he drowned.Just how he died in the presence of six instructors, other cadets and officers is not known yet.Police investigations are on into both incidents. NDA is holding a court of inquiry. Both families have alleged a conspiracy and demanded ‘impartial investigations’.The back-to-back deaths at India’s premier military academy have triggered a deep introspection within defence and training circles about SSB, the training regimen and the psychological resilience expected of boys and girls fresh out of school.Selection for NDA is one of the most gruelling in the world — some 6 lakh sign up for just 406 seats. After clearing a UPSC written exam, candidates have to undergo an SSB interview process that lasts four days for those that clear screening. Then, there are medical tests. It’s after this multi-layered filtering that cadets earn the right to wear the Ashoka emblem on their NDA beret.Then comes training. Often, night merges into sleepless night after the day’s soul-sapping ‘ ragda ’ for first-termers. “Forget the drill square or PT grounds, merely surviving from reveille to lights-out in the squadron was a challenge in my ‘ Ikki ’ (first-termer) days,” recalled an NDA alumnus, who later joined as an instructor. “The process of forging boys into soldiers needs to be hard on mind and body. Unfortunately, sometimes tragedies happen. My heart goes out to the families of these cadets.”While the two deaths occurred under different circumstances, they are an indication of the immense adjustment pressures first-term cadets face.There have been nine deaths at NDA in the last two decades, three of them suicides. Cadets quitting training is also a major concern. A 2018 news report, quoting a report jointly prepared by Integrated Defence Staff Headquarters and NDA, revealed that between Jan 2008 and Nov 2017, as many as 1,256 cadets quit NDA, or a good 16-20% of intake every year.So, what’s going wrong?spoke to former SSB assessors, NDA instructors and former commandants and deputy commandants and a common voice emerged: the need to introduce systemic reforms that can ensure cadet safety without compromising on toughness.A consensus among several former SSB presidents and instructors is that the problem begins much before cadets even reach NDA. They point out that while the SSB process rigorously tests the mental makeup of a candidate, there is a need for a more uniform and scientific physical assessment system during the selection process itself.Candidates who fare poorly on the individual obstacle course may still get recommended if they are found fit otherwise — but the physical weakness shows up in NDA’s gruelling pace. Many candidates can’t cope with the sheer physical demands and drop out or get injured or worse.On Feb 11, 2022, defence minister Rajnath Singh informed Lok Sabha that 211 cadets had been discharged from NDA, IMA (Indian Military Academy in Dehradun) and OTA (Officers Training Academy, in Chennai and Gaya) in the previous 10 years as disabled and medically unfit for service.Experts suggest that like soldier recruitment rallies, a standardised physical test — based on measurable, uniform parameters — should be introduced for officer aspirants as well. Additionally, they recommend that cadets undergo comprehensive physical fitness assessments upon reporting to NDA.“Without a scientific baseline, how can the academy know if a cadet has weak leg muscles or poor endurance?” asked a retired physical training officer. “Instead of asking a new cadet to run a few kilometres within days of joining, the academy should build endurance gradually. Those who fail to meet standards after progressive training can then be screened out,” he suggested.“The individual obstacle test at SSB includes activities like ‘Tarzan jump’, vertical rope climbing or Burma bridge-crossing — things most civilian students have never done. Candidates from non-military schools find this difficult because it’s completely new to them,” said Brigadier Laxmicharan Patnaik, former president of an SSB centre.Brigadier Jay Konnur, former president of SSB Centre-Bangalore, acknowledged that physical standards often receive less attention during selection.“Candidates are asked to complete 10 obstacles in three minutes. We observe determination, not absolute physical capability. If a candidate manages even six, we tend to overlook the shortfall. That may not reflect the actual physical preparedness required for NDA training,” he said, adding that SSB’s focus on leadership and group dynamics often overshadows baseline fitness.“Once they reach NDA, every shortcoming becomes magnified in a far more demanding environment,” he pointed out.They are equally vocal about the need for improved and sustained psychological evaluations. “Psychological tests at SSBs are not foolproof,” said Patnaik, who was also chairman of Odisha Public Service Commission. “Repeated and deeper assessments at the academy are essential.”He feels NDA should appoint a dedicated team of psychologists to conduct regular evaluations and build a psychological dossier for each cadet.“These young men are future leaders of the armed forces. Understanding their emotional and mental resilience early can prevent breakdowns later,” Patnaik pointed out, adding that psychological counselling should be made a “normal and de-stigmatised part” of cadet life. “If we normalise counselling, first-termers will open up more. Confidential sessions can help them regain confidence and adjust to the demanding environment,” he said.“Cadets from civilian backgrounds face a stunning culture shock in the first term. They are not accustomed to the regimentation, physical demands or the sheer mental toughness that’s asked of them,” said an NDA alumnus. The academy has a system of counselling but what it needs is professional counsellors, said another alumnus.According to Major General Shukla, former commandant of SSB centre-Bhopal, the problem is compounded by interpersonal challenges within squadrons.“First-term cadets are often under immense pressure to prove themselves. Some seniors, driven by tradition or competition, unintentionally humiliate or overburden them. Sensitising senior cadets about mentorship is essential. They must handhold, not intimidate,” he said, remarking that effective mentorship and emotional support from senior cadets can ease this transition provided it is guided and monitored by officers. “Else, the same system that is meant to help may break them,” he cautioned.The “buddy system” — where every fresher is mentored by a senior cadet (overstudy) — has come under sharp scrutiny after recent incidents. Several parents, including serving officers, allege the system often crosses ethical and physical boundaries.“There are cases where seniors ask juniors to perform dangerous activities in the name of maintaining squadron honour,” said a source. “A second-term cadet suffered serious neck injuries when a senior asked him to perform a dive roll — a test the senior himself had not passed. The case is under consideration and the injured cadet is likely to board out on medical grounds.”Antriksh’s parents have alleged that his overstudy ragged him relentlessly. That is yet to be borne out in the police probe.The ‘fauji’ father of a medically boarded-out cadet said, “Each squadron competes fiercely in swimming, cross-country, or equestrian events. Seniors push juniors to unrealistic limits to maintain their reputation. This is neither scientific nor fair. This practice needs to be stopped.”However, former NDA commandants defend the mentorship tradition, insisting that when implemented correctly, it helps cadets adapt to a tough environment.Lt Gen Asit Mistry (retd), a former NDA commandant, said, “The buddy system has existed for decades and works effectively. Senior cadets help newcomers cope with the rigours of training. It’s unclear what went wrong in these cases, but the concept is sound.”Another former commandant added, “There is no scope for ragging or unscientific practices. Each squadron has officers specifically responsible for cadet welfare, who personally monitor stress and morale. Deviations must be dealt with seriously.”Ex-NDAs fiercely defend the academy’s ethos, and its emphasis on physical and mental toughness, pointing out that the system has produced three Param Vir Chakras, 12 Ashoka Chakras, 32 Mahavir Chakras and 160 Vir Chakras.But officers have also acknowledged the existence of what they term “unscientific traditions” — informal endurance practices not sanctioned but culturally ingrained. “These sessions are not officially part of the training schedule. But they are often conducted by senior cadets in the name of toughening them up. It can lead to injuries or psychological breakdowns,” said a former physical training officer.Another veteran observed that while the intention may be to foster toughness, such practices must be replaced with structured, scientific endurance programmes. “We must stop romanticising suffering as character-building. A soldier’s resilience should be built through method, not shock,” he suggested.Another alumnus recalled his own early struggles: “In my first term, I felt completely out of place. I couldn’t meet the standards and thought of quitting. It was only in the third term that I regained confidence. The system is harsh — but it shouldn’t break you before it builds you.”An officer who was part of the TriServices Committee, which tried to reform practices at training academies in 2003, said barracks punishments are the reasons for suicides and should be stopped immediately. “Most armies have changed it. Punishments can be military-ways, but harassment during night or odd hours should end immediately,” he toldon the condition of anonymity. “The academy must evolve with the times,” said Major General Shukla. “We cannot afford to lose bright young minds to outdated systems. The goal is not to dilute training, but to make it safer, smarter, and more humane.”As the investigations into the two deaths continue, the hope is that the tragedy will become a catalyst for long-overdue change — one that ensures no more dreams are extinguished in the process of building the nation’s defenders.Far from the institutional debate lies the anguish of devastated families. Rubikumari Yadav, mother of first-termer Aditya Yadav, said her life has been shattered. “My son dreamed of serving the nation, and now I am left with nothing. The academy says there was no fault. Who is responsible for my son’s death then?” she asked.Antriksh’s family says he faced intense pressure and humiliation from a senior cadet. “He topped his school and was full of dreams,” said his uncle, A P Sengar. “But he couldn’t bear the pressure. This is not training — it’s trauma.”Reacting to the allegations levelled by Antriksh’s parents, then NDA commandant Vice-Admiral Gurcharan Singh told, “It is a regrettable incident. He was a good cadet and performing well. We are in touch with the family and extending all possible assistance. A court of inquiry has been ordered to ascertain the facts.”But that’s little consolation for Rubikumari. “At the end of the day, I lost my son — and they lost one of the nation’s best,” she said.| Cadet Aditya D Yadav dies during swimming session| Cadet Antriksh Kumar Singh dies by suicide| Gentleman Cadet S Balu dies during a swimming session| Gentleman Cadet Kumbhar Atharv Sambhaji dies during cross country run| Gentleman Cadet Umang Khar dies from a heat stroke| Cadet R Rabijith dies during training| Cadets follow a clear hierarchy within each squadron, ensuring continuous guidance. Five officers are assigned to every squadron, with officers on site, regularly interacting with cadetsTo ensure that cadets can raise concerns without fear, NDA runs a confidential Cadet Suggestion Forum — overseen by highest Academy authorities, monitored daily| Each squadron has two dedicated counsellors, along with service officers who provide additional guidance. This process is monitored by the battalion commander (a colonel-rank officer)| Training is scientific and progressive, designed for gradual physical and mental conditioning. The routine for first-term cadets is engineered with flexibility to facilitate a smooth settling-in period and reduce stress. Cadets needing extra physical support receive bespoke training","Nda’s training regimen takes cadets beyond mental and physical limits of endurance. For some, however, the road ends not in a quiet withdrawal, but in tragedy. Two recent deaths at the premier military training academy have forced deep introspection into selection and training.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125514667,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-585314,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

In his petition, Michel challenged Article 17 of the treaty, signed in 1999, which allows the requesting state (in this case, India) to prosecute extradited persons not only for the specific offence for which extradition was done, but also for connected offences. Michel was extradited from Dubai in Dec 2018 under this treaty.","Alleged middleman christian michel james is an accused in the rs 3,600 crore agustawestland vvip chopper scam case.

NEW DELHI: RJD chief Lalu Prasad's wife and former Bihar CM Rabri Devi asked Rouse Avenue Courts here to shift four alleged IRCTC scam-linked cases away from special judge Vishal Gogne, accusing him of conducting proceedings ""with a premeditated mind with a sole aim to convict"", reports Vineet Upadhyay.Rabri's application, filed before the principal district and sessions judge, seeks transfer of all four matters in which she is an accused: the alleged IRCTC hotel tender scam, an alleged cash-for-jobs case, and related money-laundering proceedings.Rabri Devi claimed she will not receive a fair trial under Gogne, alleging he was ""disproportionately inclined in favour of the prosecution"" and that his approach has undermined judicial neutrality. According to her, withholding rulings on these filings deprived the accused of the right to appeal.","Rabri devi asks court to shift four alleged irctc scam-linked cases away from special judge vishal gogne.
