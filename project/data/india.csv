What comes next: A golden future?



Where Else But Dubai? A Street Dedicated Entirely to Gold Is on the Way





All that glitters is not gold but in Dubai it may soon be as the UAE emirate has announced plans to build what it calls the world’s first Gold Street, which will be constructed using gold elements in the heart of a newly launched Dubai Gold District. This marks a glittering new chapter in the emirate’s retail and trade landscape.Unveiled by Ithra Dubai as part of a purpose-built destination designed to bring together the entire gold and jewellery value chain, from retail to bullion trading and investment, the Gold Street is envisioned as both an architectural marvel and a signature attraction for visitors and global traders.Dubai’s connection to gold is not new as the emirate has long been a global hub for the precious metal. In 2024-25, the UAE exported around USD 53.41 billion worth of gold, cementing its place as the second-largest physical gold trading destination in the world, with key partners including Switzerland, the United Kingdom, India, Hong Kong and Türkiye.However, Gold Street is more than a marketing gimmick. It is being positioned as a symbolic and commercial cornerstone of the broader Dubai Gold District. Together with gold retail, bullion trading, wholesale markets and investment services clustered in one place, Dubai is staking a claim to lead the future of gold commerce.Rather than a single street of golden pavement, Gold Street is part of a vast, unified ecosystem that Dubai’s leaders hope will serve shoppers, traders, investors and tourists alike:Officials say the Gold Street will complement this infrastructure by acting as a central attraction that celebrates gold not only as a commodity but as a cultural, artistic and tourism asset.The launch of the Dubai Gold District comes during a momentous period for the UAE’s economy, as the country seeks to diversify away from hydrocarbons and further develop sectors like trade, tourism, luxury retail and investment services. Dubai’s leadership has made no secret of the goal to position the emirate as a global gateway for commerce, culture and leisure and the Gold District fits squarely within that strategy.According to Issam Galadari, CEO of Ithra Dubai, the district “brings together heritage, scale and opportunity,” creating a diverse ecosystem of traders, retailers, investors and global brands that serve shoppers and buyers across international markets.Ahmed Al Khaja, CEO of Dubai Festivals and Retail Establishment, noted that the Gold District marks a defining moment in Dubai’s evolution as a global destination for commerce and tourism. He described gold as “deeply woven into the cultural and commercial fabric of Dubai,” symbolising the emirate’s prosperity and entrepreneurial spirit.While the idea of a street made of gold conjures images of pure opulence, industry insiders see deeper commercial and strategic value:Officials have said that details about the Gold Street’s design and construction will be revealed in phases. Though timing has not yet been fully disclosed, developers emphasise that Gold Street will complement Dubai’s existing commercial and cultural fabric, rather than operate as a standalone installation.As Dubai continues to expand its role in global gold markets and builds out attractions that blend luxury, culture and commerce, the Gold District anchored by the promised Gold Street may become both a symbol of the emirate’s economic confidence and a vibrant global destination for buyers and tourists alike.Dubai’s launch of the Dubai Gold District and plans for the world’s first Gold Street reflect how the city continues to innovate in retail, tourism and global trade, using its strategic strengths to shape future growth. By consolidating the gold and jewellery landscape under one roof and adding an iconic gold-lined street, Dubai is not just celebrating its heritage; it is redefining the way gold is experienced in the 21st century.","Dubai to build world’s first “gold street” inside a new global gold district.

Niagara Falls frozen in -20 degrees: How a record polar vortex turned the mighty waterfall into a surreal ice wonderland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/niagara-falls-frozen-in-20-degrees-how-a-record-polar-vortex-turned-the-mighty-waterfall-into-a-surreal-ice-wonderland/articleshow/127643549.cms,"Source: X

How the polar vortex affected Niagara Falls



Partial freezing of the Niagara River



Niagara Falls: A natural wonder in winter and of cultural significance







A strong polar vortex moved across North America not long ago. Temperatures around Niagara Falls plunged below −20°C, far colder than usual. The mist from the waterfalls met the freezing air, and suddenly, ice began to coat everything. Cliffs, riverbanks, and even sections of the Niagara River were layered with frozen sheets. Water still flowed, but the mist froze quickly in midair. Videos from locals show strange formations, frozen spray, rainbows catching the light, and a quiet, otherworldly feeling over the whole scene. The falls didn’t stop, but the world around them seemed paused.The vortex pushed Arctic air down. Mist from the falls, normally liquid for a short time even in winter, froze almost instantly. Ice built slowly on rocks and railings. The river itself started to harden in slow-moving areas along the shore. Water flowing and water frozen, side by side. Some patterns look like glass, reflecting the low sun. It is hard to tell if it is moving or still, and sometimes the edges glint with fleeting colours in the icy mist.The mist and spray from the waterfalls consist of small water droplets suspended in the air. In normal winter conditions, some of the water droplets in the mist and spray may freeze slowly on the rocks and other surfaces nearby.But when the temperature is below −20°C, the freezing process is very rapid. The water droplets in the mist and spray freeze instantly as soon as they come into contact with the cold surfaces. A frozen “shell” forms slowly around the edges of the waterfalls and the surrounding landscape. Pictures and videos show the beautiful ice formations, frozen sheets of spray, and ice sculptures formed as a result of the constant freezing process.Large sheets of ice formed where the river moves more slowly. Faster sections stayed liquid, giving a strange, uneven contrast. The river and the falls together seemed alive but muted, restrained. Ice thickened where it could, leaving gaps for flowing water. The interplay of frozen and moving water is not regular, not neat. It feels chaotic and quiet at the same time, like nature rehearsing, pausing, then moving on again.Niagara Falls, sitting on the US-Canada border, consists of Horseshoe Falls, American Falls, and Bridal Veil Falls. Millions of litres of water pour over the cliffs every second, sending up mist that usually hovers and drifts. In winter, that mist hardens. The falls are not silent, not still, but the icy surroundings transform the place into something uncanny. Visitors each year see a different face: green summers with boats, winters with frozen cliffs. Weather extremes like this vortex remind us that even the strongest, most familiar landscapes can change dramatically, showing a quieter, frozen side of a place that never truly sleeps.","A strong polar vortex moved across north america not long ago.

Bar leaders allege violence, warn of protests

What was the case?





Pakistan’s prominent human rights lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad. The incident triggered strong condemnation from legal bodies and rights activists over what they described as unconstitutional move.The lawyer couple was on its way to the Additional District and Sessions Court to appear in a case linked to controversial social media posts when police intercepted their vehicle. Arrest warrants had been issued against them on January 16 after the court cancelled their interim bail, news agency PTI reported.The arrest was confirmed by Imaan’s mother, Dr Shireen Mazari, a former federal human rights minister in the Imran Khan government, who said the couple was detained without explanation and taken to undisclosed locations.In a post on X, Mazari said that her daughter and son-in-law “have been arrested, put in separate cars, and taken away to unknown locations,” adding that no arrest warrant or formal document was shown to them at the time, according to Dawn.Calling the incident a sign of repression, she wrote: “Fascism at its peak. Emasculated men in power must be so pleased with this achievement!”Mazari also shared videos on social media showing police vehicles following the lawyers’ car before blocking it on the road. In the footage, officers were seen opening the car doors, surrounding the vehicle and attempting to pull the occupants out. Another clip showed shattered car windows, which Mazari alleged were broken by the police during the arrest.In a separate post, she claimed that police had used force not only against the couple but also against senior members of the legal fraternity who were accompanying them.“Seems they (police) used violence on Imaan and Hadi also,” Mazari wrote, alleging that the arrest was carried out to prevent further embarrassment to authorities during court proceedings.Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) president Wajid Ali Gilani, who was present at the scene, said the arrest violated assurances given by authorities that the lawyers would be allowed safe passage to court.In a video message shared by Mazari, Gilani said the police attacked the convoy near Serena Chowk, broke car windows, forcibly removed the couple and pushed Imaan into a police vehicle. He also alleged that police officials assaulted IHCBA secretary Manzoor Jajja during the incident.“The authorities should stop this oppression. If they do not, then the 2007 lawyers’ movement will be launched again,” Gilani warned, referring to the mass protests that once challenged military rule in Pakistan.The Islamabad High Court Bar Association, Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) and Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) issued separate statements condemning the arrests, calling them illegal and unconstitutional.The IHCBA and IBA announced a strike on Friday, while the IBC called for a nationwide lawyers’ strike on Saturday. The bar councils demanded the immediate release of the couple and an independent inquiry into the conduct of police officials involved.In a statement, the IBA said the arrest violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Pakistan’s Constitution, stressing that “every citizen has the right to defend themselves in court without fear.”Human Rights Commission of Pakistan strongly condemned the arrest of both lawyers. In a post on X, the organzation wrote: ""HRCP demands immediate disclosure of their whereabouts and holds the authorities fully responsible for any harm. Ms Mazari-Hazir and Mr Chattha must be released immediately.""The primary case against Mazari-Hazir and Chattha stems from a complaint filed in August 2025 with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), accusing Mazari of spreading content allegedly aligned with banned organisations. Her husband was implicated for reposting some of the content.They were indicted in October last year, and arrest warrants were issued after repeated non-appearances led to the cancellation of their interim bail.Additional cases linked to protests and an alleged scuffle outside the Islamabad High Court have also been filed against them, some of which are still under judicial review.","Imaan zainab mazari-hazir and hadi ali chattha were arrested on friday.

Karachi Gul Plaza Fire Claims At Least 10 Lives, Dozens Missing As Rescue Operations Continue





The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan’s Karachi has risen to 14 after rescue teams recovered eight more bodies from the debris, officials said on Monday.The blaze broke out late Saturday night at Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market on MA Jinnah Road in the city’s Saddar area. The fire was brought under control by Sunday night, but rescue operations continued as large parts of the building suffered severe structural damage.Six bodies were found soon after the fire erupted, with officials saying the victims likely died of suffocation. Dozens of injured people were rushed to nearby hospitals. As the fire spread rapidly, thick smoke and intense heat initially prevented rescue teams from entering the building.“Once the fire was doused, we didn’t wait for the cooling period and forcibly went in to rescue trapped people and we found eight more bodies, some badly charred,” Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Abid Jalal told PTI.Jalal said the fire had almost completely damaged the building, with both the front and rear portions collapsing due to weakened pillars.“The structure has become extremely unsafe, and we are still searching as there is a risk of further collapses,” he said.Gul Plaza, built in the early 1980s, houses around 1,200 shops spread across a basement, mezzanine and three upper floors. It has long been a prominent commercial hub in Karachi.Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site on Monday, said authorities feared that dozens of people could still be trapped inside. “We are extremely concerned and alarmed. Efforts are going on to find them but this is a national tragedy,” he told reporters.South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza said the casualty count could rise as large sections of the building were yet to be searched. Officials suspect an electrical short circuit may have caused the fire, though the exact cause will be confirmed after a full investigation.The incident has once again highlighted serious fire safety concerns in Karachi. In recent years, several commercial buildings in the city have caught fire due to poor safety measures, faulty electrical systems and illegal construction.A government audit in 2024 found that most shopping malls lacked proper fire safety systems, emergency exits and compliant wiring.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, while the Sindh government has ordered an inquiry into the incident.","The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in pakistan’s karachi has risen to 14.

At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday, including six children, as dense fog and over-speeding continued to disrupt traffic across several regions, according to officials.In the first incident, 14 people, including six children and five women, lost their lives when a truck carrying passengers fell from a bridge into a dry canal in Punjab’s Sargodha district.According to news agency PTI, the accident occurred in Kot Momin tehsil, around 200 kilometres from Lahore, during the early hours of the day.A spokesperson for Punjab Emergency Services Rescue 1122 said the truck had 23 people on board, most of them members of an extended family travelling from Islamabad to Faisalabad to attend a funeral.“As the motorway was closed because of heavy fog, the truck took a local route. It fell from the Galapur bridge in Kot Momin tehsil into a dry canal as the driver lost control over the vehicle because of poor visibility,” the spokesperson said.Nine people were injured in the crash and are being treated at the Civil Hospital in Kot Momin, according to PTI.In a separate incident in Balochistan, at least nine people were killed and 15 others injured when a passenger coach overturned on the Makran Coastal Highway near Gwadar early Saturday.Coastal Highway Police Superintendent of Police Aslam Bangulzai confirmed the accident, saying the coach was travelling from Jiwani to Karachi. “The accident took place early this morning on the Makran coastal highway as the passenger coach overturned due to over speeding,” Bangulzai said, as quoted by PTI.Dense fog has severely affected traffic movement across Punjab’s motorways and major roads during night and early morning hours since the onset of an extreme cold wave last month.As reported by Dawn, several motorway sections have been closed intermittently due to low visibility.Pakistan frequently witnesses fatal road accidents, with factors such as over-speeding, poor enforcement of traffic rules, driver fatigue and weak licensing controls cited as major causes.On December 31, at least 14 passengers were killed in a head-on collision between a bus and a van on the Jhang-Faisalabad road in Punjab, according to PTI.","At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in pakistan on saturday.

Ex-PM Hasina Calls Yunus “Murderous Fascist,” Warns Bangladesh at Edge of Abyss





A Bangladesh court on Monday sentenced Dhaka’s fugitive former police chief and two senior officers to death for crimes against humanity over the killing of six protesters during the July 2024 mass uprising that led to the overthrow of then prime minister Sheikh Hasina.The International Crimes Tribunal-1 (ICT-1) handed the death penalty to former Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) commissioner Habibur Rahman, former joint commissioner Sudip Kumar Chakrabort and former additional deputy commissioner (Ramna zone) Shah Alam Mohammad Akhtarul Islam. All three were tried in absentia and their whereabouts remain unknown, as reported by Dhaka Tribune.The verdict comes ahead of Bangladesh’s February 12 elections, the first polls since Hasina was ousted in August 2024 following weeks of mass protests.Five other former police officials were sentenced to varying prison terms. Former assistant commissioner of Ramna zone Mohammad Imrul was jailed for six years; former Shahbagh Police Station inspector (operations) Md Arshad Hossain received four years; while constables Md Sujan Mia, Md Imaz Hossain Emon and Md Nasirul Islam were sentenced to three years each. Arshad, Sujan, Imaz and Nasirul are currently in custody.The case relates to the killing of six protesters in Dhaka’s Chankharpul area on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fled to India as demonstrators stormed her official residence.The verdict was delivered by a three-member bench of ICT-1 comprising Justice Mozumder, Justice Md Shafiul Alam Mahmud and Judge Md Mohitul Hoque Anam Chowdhury.Reading out the verdict, tribunal chairman Justice Md Golam Mortuza Mozumder said that the evidence proved that police opened fire with lethal weapons on protesters.“The police forces… opened fire with lethal weapons… causing death to the aforesaid six persons,” the judge told the court.The tribunal heard that Habibur Rahman sent messages to police units ordering them to use lethal force to crush the protests.Chief Prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam said that he was satisfied with the death sentences but expressed disappointment over the prison terms handed to the other five accused, according to the Dailystar.“The court said their crimes have been proved and they committed crimes against humanity,” Islam told reporters, adding that he would appeal for harsher punishment for those given jail terms.Families of the victims, however, expressed dissatisfaction with the judgment. Sanjida Khan, the mother of slain protester Shahriar Khan Anas, broke down inside the courtroom.“We can never be satisfied with this verdict. We did not get Insaaf (justice),” she said, questioning the prosecution over the sentences.Similarly, Shahid Ahmed, uncle of another victim, Md Yakub, said the lighter sentences posed a threat.“We wanted death sentence for all. Instead, some of them got three to four years’ imprisonment. After completing their terms, they will come out and might threaten us,” he said.This is the second verdict delivered by the tribunal over crimes against humanity committed during the July uprising.In November last year, the same court sentenced Sheikh Hasina and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal to death in absentia in a separate case.Former police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, who confessed and turned state witness, was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment in that case.The Chankharpul investigation report was submitted on April 21, 2025, the first filed before the reconstituted tribunal with formal charges framed on July 14.After examining 26 witnesses over 23 working days, the tribunal concluded that the police firing was carried out on direct orders from senior officials, warranting the maximum punishment.","Bangladesh court sentences dhaka's fugitive former police chief and two senior officers to death for crimes against humanity.

Chanchal after finishing work used to sleep inside the workshop, police said and added that as per CCTV camera footage, ""several individuals were seen setting fire to the workshop"". Locals claimed that this reinforces suspicions that the killing was deliberate.

Stonehenge mystery solved? Study reveals how 25-tonne stones reached the site in southern England,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/stonehenge-mystery-solved-study-reveals-how-25-tonne-stones-reached-the-site-in-southern-england/articleshow/127561744.cms,"Researchers uncovered the truth behind Stonehenge’s 25 tonne stones

Salisbury Plain shows no sign of ancient ice

Sarsens were local but still demanding

Bluestones point clearly to human effort

What the science changes and what it does not





Stonehenge rests on open chalk ground in southern England, recognisable but strangely unexplained. For decades, one practical question has hung over the site without resolution. How did stones weighing hundreds of tonnes come here before wheels, metal tools, and written plans? A recent research led by geologists at Curtin University puts that debate on stronger foundation. The researchers examined microscopic mineral grains in local river sediments to see if glaciers had brought the stones south during the Ice Age. The results point away from the ice and towards people. The terrain surrounding Salisbury Plain contains no chemical traces of glacial transport. Instead, the sediments represent local recycling. This supports the theory that Neolithic communities actively moved the stones over large distances on their own.The research “Detrital zircon–apatite fingerprinting challenges glacial transport of Stonehenge’s megaliths” focuses on detrital minerals, mainly zircon and apatite, found in streams that drain Salisbury Plain. These grains act as long-lived markers of where sediment has travelled. If glaciers had crossed the area, they would likely have left behind mineral signatures from Wales or northern Britain.That signal is absent. The zircon ages instead match rocks already known from southern England, suggesting the material has been recycled locally rather than dumped by ice. This matters because glacial transport has often been used as a convenient explanation. If ice sheets had carried the stones close to Stonehenge, human effort could be seen as minimal. The new data makes that position harder to hold.The study also reinforces a growing consensus among geomorphologists. There is little physical evidence that glaciers ever reached Salisbury Plain during the Pleistocene. No clear moraines, no consistent erratic trails, no buried till layers. While ice did extend far into Britain during earlier cold periods, its southern limits remain well north of the monument.Fine sediments can travel far beyond glaciers through meltwater. Large stones usually do not. The absence of glacial fingerprints in the surrounding sediment makes it unlikely that multi-tonne blocks arrived by chance.Not all of Stonehenge came from far away. The largest stones, the sarsens, were sourced from West Woods, about 25 kilometres to the north. That distance may sound modest, but the stones weigh around 25 tonnes each. Moving them would still have required planning, labour and time. The mineral analysis does not focus on sarsens directly, but it supports a broader pattern. Stonehenge was not constructed using random materials that happened to be located nearby. Its materials were selected and brought in with intent.The smaller bluestones tell a sharper story. Their geological fingerprints match outcrops in the Preseli Hills of west Wales, around 230 kilometres away. Some stones may have travelled by sea for part of that journey, others overland. Either way, the distances involved rule out casual movement. One stone stands out even more. The Altar Stone appears to come from the Orcadian Basin in northeast Scotland. If correct, that implies a journey of more than 700 kilometres. No known ice route explains this. Human organisation does.The study does not describe exactly how the stones were moved. Sledges, rollers and boats remain plausible tools. What it does change is the balance of probability. Stonehenge looks less like a monument finished by chance and more like one completed through sustained effort. There is no single moment where the mystery disappears. Instead, the space for easy answers narrows. The stones arrived because people brought them. That idea now sits more comfortably with the evidence, even if the work behind it remains only partly visible.",Researchers examined microscopic mineral grains in local river sediments to see if glaciers had brought the stones south during the ice age.

What the dagger reveals about the burial

What archaeologists hope to learn next





Archaeologists in Sweden have uncovered a striking Stone Age discovery: The well-preserved remains of a dog buried around 5,000 years ago alongside a carefully crafted dagger made from bone. The burial was found in a wetland that was once a lake, a setting that helped protect fragile remains for millennia. What makes the find so fascinating is how deliberate it appears. This was not a random deposit or scattered bones. The placement suggests intention, meaning, and possibly even ceremony. To researchers, the message is clear: This dog may have been valued far beyond an ordinary animal.The dog’s skeleton was found in remarkably good condition, especially for something this old. It was uncovered by archaeologists from Arkeologerna, a unit within Sweden’s National Historical Museums, during an excavation at Logsjomossen near Jarna linked to construction work for the Ostlanken railway project. Because the burial lay in waterlogged sediments from what was once a lake, the wetland environment helped preserve fragile organic remains far better than normal soil would. What struck researchers immediately was how intentional it looked, as if someone had carefully placed the dog there rather than leaving it behind as simple waste.Alongside the dog was a polished bone dagger, described as long and finely made. In prehistoric societies, objects like this were not casual possessions. A blade tool could represent skill, status, or even symbolic meaning, depending on the culture and context.The fact that it was placed with the dog suggests the animal had significance. The dagger may have been a grave gift, a sign of honour, or something meant to accompany the dog in death.Dogs in the Stone Age were not only companions. They could be protectors, hunting partners, trackers, and vital members of daily survival. A strong, reliable dog might have been seen as part of the group’s success, especially in harsh environments where every advantage mattered.A careful burial could reflect gratitude, respect, or an emotional bond. It may also indicate that this dog held a special role, possibly linked to hunting, guarding, or ritual significance in the community.The burial was found in sediments that once sat at the bottom of a shallow lake. That detail matters because water and wetlands have long been associated with ritual deposits in ancient Europe. People often placed valued objects into lakes, bogs, and rivers as offerings or ceremonial acts.If this was a ritual burial, it adds a deeper layer to the story. It suggests the dog was not only important in life, but still held meaning after death.Discoveries like this rarely give up their secrets immediately. Researchers will likely study the remains through dating and lab analysis to understand details such as the dog’s life, diet, health, and age at death.Over time, the burial could help answer bigger questions about how Stone Age people in Scandinavia lived, what role dogs played in their societies, and how early humans expressed loyalty, care, and respect for animals that shared their world.","Archaeologists in sweden have uncovered a striking stone age discovery.

Toxic manager driving you crazy? What UAE employees can and can’t do,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/toxic-manager-driving-you-crazy-what-uae-employees-can-and-cant-do/articleshow/127704966.cms,"UAE Bosses: Are You Suffering an Incompetent Manager? The Law Might Surprise You.

Why incompetence is not a standalone legal complaint

You cannot lodge a legal complaint simply because you think your manager lacks leadership skills or fails to perform well.

What can form a complaint is behaviour that violates your legal rights, such as harassment, discrimination, workplace bullying, verbal abuse or creating a hostile environment. In other words, legal protections kick in when a manager’s actions harm employees ’ dignity, safety or rights, but not merely because of perceived poor management or lack of skills.

When does the law does protect you

Harassment and Abuse - Article 14(2) of the Employment Law prohibits verbal, physical or psychological harassment at work. Managers who demean, insult, bully or shout at employees could be in breach of this rule, and employees can take action if such behaviour occurs.

Safe Work Environment - Article 13 of the Labour Law requires employers to provide a safe and appropriate environment, including freedom from harassment or intimidation.

Article 13 of the Labour Law requires employers to provide a safe and appropriate environment, including freedom from harassment or intimidation. Criminal Liability for Abuse - The UAE Penal Code also makes insult and abuse a punishable offence in certain contexts, with penalties that may include fines or even imprisonment if the conduct rises to criminal standards.

What you can do as an employee

Document the Behaviour - Keep a clear record of incidents that show unprofessional conduct, abuse or actions harmful to your wellbeing, including dates, times and any witnesses. This is essential if you escalate the issue.

Keep a clear record of incidents that show unprofessional conduct, abuse or actions harmful to your wellbeing, including dates, times and any witnesses. This is essential if you escalate the issue.

File With MoHRE - If internal processes fail, employees can file a complaint with the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE), which oversees workplace disputes and can mediate between parties.

If internal processes fail, employees can file a complaint with the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE), which oversees workplace disputes and can mediate between parties. Resign Without Notice (In Serious Cases) - Under UAE law, an employee who suffers harassment, assault or violence at work can leave without serving notice if they report the incident within five working days of experiencing it. This is designed to protect staff from being trapped in abusive work situations.

UAE Labour Law: When Managerial Incompetence Becomes a Legal Complaint





Feeling stuck under a manager you believe is unskilled, disrespectful or outright incompetent in the UAE? This common workplace frustration in the United Arab Emirates is not treated as a mere incompetence since as per the law you can directly take it to a labour authority or court. What matters legally is how that incompetence affects your work environment and your rights as an employee.UAE legal experts makes clear that an “incompetent” manager alone is not, in itself, a statutory ground for an official complaint in the UAE.Under UAE labour law, employers are required to provide a safe, respectful and dignified working environment but the law does not specifically define “competence” or managerial skill as enforceable criteria for reporting a manager. What this means in practice is:The UAE’s employment laws, including Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 on the Regulation of Employment Relations, obligate employers to ensure a respectful and appropriate work environment for employees. Specific provisions include protections against several forms of workplace misconduct:These protections are significant because, while incompetence itself isn’t actionable, how a manager behaves in exercising their role can be. If incompetence spills over into harassment, discrimination or abusive conduct, there is a legal basis for complaint.If you are troubled by your manager’s conduct or environment, experts advise:Critically, the law does not define “incompetent performance”, such as poor leadership, indecision or lack of experience, as a legal violation because it is generally an internal organisational issue, not a statutory one.Many employees on forums like Reddit discuss frustration over rude, micromanaging or humiliating managers, but these conversations reflect perception rather than a clear legal violation unless the manager’s actions include behaviour forbidden by law.Legal experts and commentators agree that UAE laws provide broad protections against mistreatment but they are structured around conduct rather than competence. According to employment law specialists:However, simply disagreeing with managerial decisions or feeling that a leader lacks skills is not enough for a formal complaint under current UAE law.Workers unsure of their legal standing or facing serious misconduct from managers are advised to consult a legal professional or a workplace rights advocate. Legal guidance can help clarify whether documented behaviour rises to the level of harassment, discrimination or unlawful workplace conduct, which can be actionable in the UAE.Whether you are navigating internal conflict, unhappy with management style, or facing behaviour that feels abusive, understanding the distinction between “incompetence” and illegal workplace conduct is key to knowing when and how to move forward. Incompetent management alone is not a legal ground for complaint in the UAE. Abusive, harassing or discriminatory conduct by managers is actionable.Complaints are filed through HR, MoHRE and potentially police depending on behaviour severity. Legal protections exist to safeguard employees from hostile work environments.","You cannot lodge a legal complaint simply because you think your manager lacks leadership skills or fails to perform well.

Nipah virus in India

What is Nipah Virus?

Initial Symptoms: It often starts with ""flu-like"" signs such as fever, headache, muscle pain, and vomiting.

Respiratory Impact: In many cases, it leads to acute respiratory infection, making it difficult for the patient to breathe.

Neurological Crisis: In severe instances, the virus can cause encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), leading to drowsiness, disorientation, and even coma within 24 to 48 hours.

Countries on alert

Could the UAE get Nipah?



What should you do?









India’s public health authorities are closely monitoring the situation after two confirmed Nipah virus cases in West Bengal, confirmed by the Indian Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).While the cases remain limited, the news has drawn attention because Kerala had previously reported four Nipah infections in 2025, including in the Malappuram and Kozhikode districts, highlighting the regions’ vulnerability to sporadic outbreaks of this rare virus.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Nipah can be highly lethal, with a fatality rate of up to 75%, underscoring why authorities take even isolated detections seriously.According to the Indian Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), only 2 confirmed Nipah virus cases have been reported in West Bengal since December 2025. A total of 196 contacts linked to these cases were traced, monitored and tested, all of whom were found asymptomatic.In an exclusive interview with ANI, Dr Narender Kumar Arora, President of AIIMS Bilaspur and Chairman of India’s COVID‑19 Working Group, spoke about the presence of Nipah virus in India.He noted that Kerala and West Bengal are endemic regions and that past cases have been carefully monitored.“Nipah virus is a zoonotic disease… highly infectious and fatal. Patients either develop symptoms of encephalitis or severe respiratory disease, and mortality is 40 to 75%, which is very high,” Dr Arora told ANI. He added that recent cases in West Bengal were first detected among healthcare workers, with further monitoring of potentially exposed individuals underway.He also emphasised that no vaccine is currently available. “Monoclonal antibodies are to be given as soon as someone is diagnosed… There is a very limited supply globally, and India is working to ensure sufficient availability,” he said. Dr Arora stressed that minimising contact with fruit bats and other potential carriers is key to preventing infection.The Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic virus, meaning it originally circulates in animals before jumping to humans.Its natural hosts are fruit bats (also known as flying foxes).Humans can become infected by eating fruit contaminated by bat saliva or urine, drinking raw date palm sap, or through close contact with infected pigs or other humans.What makes Nipah particularly concerning is its aggressive nature. Unlike a typical flu, Nipah can cause a range of severe conditions:Because there is currently no specific vaccine or cure for Nipah, treatment is limited to ""supportive care"" (managing symptoms).This is why the World Health Organization (WHO) lists it as a priority pathogen, its high mortality rate and lack of treatment make early detection and strict border control the most effective weapons we haveThe confirmation of isolated cases in India has prompted heightened vigilance across parts of Asia, with several countries reviewing passenger screening procedures as a precautionary public health measure. In India, health checks at international departure points have been strengthened to identify symptomatic travellers before boarding.International health agencies have stressed that the situation is being closely monitored and remains contained, with surveillance and contact tracing helping prevent wider spread. Officials continue to emphasise vigilance rather than alarm.There have been no confirmed cases of Nipah virus in the UAE, and health authorities say the risk remains low. Nevertheless, the UAE’s healthcare system has activated standard monitoring protocols in coordination with major airports.The UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP) is working with aviation authorities to ensure travellers arriving from regions reporting cases are screened for symptoms such as fever, respiratory distress or neurological signs.Experts note that Nipah does not spread easily, unlike respiratory viruses such as COVID-19, and typically requires prolonged close contact. Preventive screening is therefore a precaution, not a response to any detected spread.For the general public in the UAE, the impact is minimal beyond staying informed. Travellers returning from areas reporting Nipah cases are advised to monitor their health for up to 14 days and seek medical attention if symptoms such as fever, headache or breathing difficulties develop.Health authorities stress that following official advisories, practising good hygiene and reporting symptoms early remain the most effective safeguards. With early detection and transparent communication, officials say the risk of local transmission remains extremely low.","Nipah virus has been confirmed in two cases in west bengal, india.

Göbekli Tepe was built thousands of years before civilisation was meant to begin

The pillars dominate the landscape and the debate

Special buildings suggest non-domestic use

Settlement evidence complicates early theories

Diet points to life before full agriculture

A carved boar drew attention in recent excavations

Recognition brings protection and visitors





According to World Atlas , Göbekli Tepe sits on a low limestone ridge in southeastern Turkey, not far from the Syrian border, and continues to unsettle long-held ideas about early human societies. The site was first identified in the 1960s, but its significance only became clear decades later. Radiocarbon dating places its construction between about 9600 and 8200 BCE, far earlier than Stonehenge and long before farming was thought to be established. What remains visible today are rings of large T-shaped pillars carved from local stone, some standing more than five metres tall. Their scale and finish raise quiet but persistent questions about who built them, how they organised themselves, and what drew people to this place so early.One of the most striking aspects of Göbekli Tepe is its age. It was built at a time when people in the region are believed to have lived as hunter-gatherers, moving seasonally and relying on wild resources. Agriculture, pottery, and permanent villages are thought to have come later. Yet the effort required to quarry, shape, transport, and erect the pillars suggests planning and cooperation over long periods. This does not sit comfortably with older models of small, loosely connected groups.More than twenty structures have been identified so far, many arranged in circular or oval layouts. At the centre of several stands, two taller pillars facing one another, surrounded by smaller stones set into walls. Some pillars are estimated to weigh up to 50 tonnes. Their surfaces are carved with reliefs of animals such as foxes, snakes, scorpions, lions, and birds. A few show stylised human features, including arms and hands, giving them an almost bodily presence without fully becoming figures.Archaeologists working at the site have distinguished ordinary buildings and what they call special buildings. The latter contain the largest and most elaborate pillars and show no clear signs of daily living, such as hearths or refuse pits. The inward-facing layout and careful placement of stones point towards gatherings of some importance. Many researchers see these structures as communal or ritual spaces, though the exact nature of their use remains uncertain.For a long time, Göbekli Tepe was seen as a place people visited occasionally rather than lived in. This view has softened as excavation continued. Later work uncovered smaller buildings nearby and fragments of human bone, suggesting longer-term occupation in the surrounding area. The picture that emerges is not of a single-purpose site but of a broader landscape where people stayed, worked, and returned over generations.Even though there are indications that the site was used for a long time, the remains of farming at Gbekli Tepe are scarce. Most of the animal bones excavated at the site belong to wild species, mainly gazelle. Among the plant remains there were wild cereals instead of domesticated crops. This means that the people linked with Gbekli Tepe still depended on hunting and gathering for their food while they dedicated a lot of time and effort to the construction of their monumental buildings. They seem to be at a turning point, with a life, style halfway between nomadic and fully settled farming.In 2023, scientists announced the finding of a life, size stone statue of a wild boar dating back to approximately 10, 500 years. It was discovered lying between the pillars and thus, it is assumed that it must have played a significant role inside the structure. Red, white and black pigments were found on parts of its surface, which leads to the assumption of the existence of colour and decoration that is now nearly totally missing on other parts of the site. Such discoveries provide us with more details about the site but at the same time, they leave us wondering.Göbekli Tepe was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 2018. Since then, it has become an important destination for visitors, with raised walkways and a dedicated visitor centre allowing access while protecting the remains. Excavation continues alongside tourism, moving slowly and deliberately. New findings tend to complicate rather than resolve the story.Göbekli Tepe does not overturn history in a single stroke. Instead, it presses gently against older timelines and assumptions. Its stones remain where they were set, offering clues without insisting on one explanation and leaving space for uncertainty to remain.","Göbekli tepe was first identified in the 1960s, but its significance only became clear decades later.

A devastating landslide in Indonesia's Pasirlangu village has claimed 34 lives, with 32 people still missing. The disaster, triggered by heavy rainfall last week, destroyed dozens of homes and forced over 650 residents to evacuate. Rescue teams are carefully searching the unstable area in West Bandung, Java island, amid fears of further landslides.""The identified bodies will be handed over to the victims' families for burial,"" said national disaster mitigation agency spokesman Abdul Muhari on Tuesday evening.

Rescue workers are using both manual methods and heavy machinery to search for survivors, but their efforts are hampered by poor weather conditions.West Java's governor Dedi Mulyadi has blamed nearby vegetable plantations for the disaster and promised to relocate affected residents. The removal of forests to create these plantations has made the area more vulnerable to landslides, as trees help absorb rainfall and their roots stabilize the ground.This incident follows similar disasters that struck Sumatra island in late 2022, where flooding and landslides killed approximately 1,200 people and displaced more than 240,000. Such natural disasters are frequent in Indonesia during the rainy season, which typically runs from October to March.The government has highlighted deforestation as a major factor contributing to these disasters. The loss of forest cover has left many areas across the Indonesian archipelago more susceptible to landslides and flooding during the wet season.","A devastating landslide in indonesia's pasirlangu village has claimed 34 lives, with 32 people still missing.

Scientists discover Karnak was built on a hidden Nile river island

Early settlement depended on river change

The temple complex once sat like an island

Later builders adapted to shifting waters

A major Nile branch flowed east of Karnak

Landscape echoes ancient belief

A slower view of a familiar monument





Ancient Karnak rose from a landscape shaped as much by water as by stone. For more than a century, excavations have focused on temples, walls and inscriptions, while the ground beneath them drew less attention. A new geoarchaeological study now shifts that focus. By drilling dozens of sediment cores across Karnak and its surroundings, researchers have traced how the River Nile once moved through the area. Their findings suggest the vast temple complex was built on a natural river terrace, once surrounded by channels. This setting may have echoed Egyptian ideas of a sacred mound rising from primordial waters. The work also helps narrow down when permanent building at Karnak became possible, offering a calmer but clearer view of how landscape and belief developed together.The study ”Conceptual origins and geomorphic evolution of the temple of Amun-Ra at Karnak (Luxor, Egypt)” shows that Karnak was not placed randomly on the floodplain. Beneath the temples lies a body of sandy deposits left by fast-flowing water thousands of years ago. These sands form a raised terrace, higher than the surrounding land. At the time of its formation, the area would have been unsuitable for long-term settlement. Only later did the Nile cut channels on either side, leaving a stable platform that people could occupy.Dating of the sediments suggests this terrace became dry and stable around 2520 BC, give or take several centuries. Before that, seasonal flooding would have made construction difficult. This timing aligns with the oldest pottery found on site, which points to early occupation during the late Old Kingdom or First Intermediate Period. The evidence supports the idea that Karnak only became viable once the river landscape shifted.Cores taken across the site reveal traces of former river channels both east and west of Karnak. These channels appear to have enclosed the terrace, turning it into an island of higher ground. Smaller channels even crossed parts of the site. Over time, some filled naturally with silt, while others remained active for centuries. The image that emerges is not a fixed setting but a patchwork of land and water that slowly changed.As dynasties rose and fell, the Nile continued to move. During the Middle Kingdom, some channels began to silt up, linking once separate areas of land. By the New Kingdom, parts of the river system were deliberately filled with sand, likely to support major construction projects. These actions suggest people were not only reacting to nature but shaping it to suit religious and political needs.One of the clearest findings is evidence for a substantial Nile channel east of the temple complex. Pottery and sediments show it was active from at least the First Intermediate Period through the New Kingdom. At its widest, it may have stretched several hundred meters. This channel later shifted eastward and eventually silted up, turning into a floodplain by the late classical period.The idea of Karnak rising from surrounding waters has long been noted in texts and temple symbolism. Egyptian creation myths describe a primaeval mound emerging from chaos. While the researchers avoid strong claims, the physical setting of an island terrace surrounded by channels fits this imagery in a quiet way. It suggests that natural features may have reinforced religious meaning, even if they were not the original reason for the site’s selection.The study does not rewrite Karnak’s history in dramatic terms. Instead, it adds depth. By combining sediment cores, pottery analysis and dating techniques, it fills gaps left by earlier work. The result is a calmer picture of a landscape in motion, where temples grew alongside changing rivers. Karnak appears less as a fixed monument and more as part of a living floodplain, shaped by time, water and gradual human choice.","Scientists discover karnak was built on a hidden nile river island.

Mystery solved: What makes the sliding rocks of Death Valley move on their own,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mystery-solved-what-makes-the-sliding-rocks-of-death-valley-move-on-their-own/articleshow/127535194.cms,"Mystery solved: What makes the sliding rocks of Death Valley move on their own (Image source: Wikipedia)

What are the sliding rocks of Racetrack Playa

How scientists finally observed the rocks move

The ice, sun, and wind mechanism

Rainwater collects on the playa, forming a thin layer of water.

Cold nights freeze the water, creating fragile ice only a few millimetres thick.

As the morning sun warms the ice, it begins to break into large floating panels.

Light winds push the ice sheets, which in turn push the rocks, dragging them slowly across the wet mud.

Why this rare phenomenon only happen occasionally

What the trails reveal

Visiting the Racetrack Playa





In one of the hottest and driest parts of the world, there is a phenomenon that is most unexpected. At a remote dry lake bed in the world-famous Death Valley area in the United States, large rocks are seen to be in motion.They slowly slide over the desert floor, with long tracks that do not seem to ever lift. The incredible movement of these rocks in the Racetrack Playa area has been a phenomenon not understood by scientists as well as tourists.There was never any animal or wind activity that could have caused the movement of the large rocks over the desert surface.Over the years, several theories were put forward, perhaps wind or even magnetic activity. Recent studies and research in the area made the phenomenon seem like one of the most interesting slow-motion events in nature.Racetrack Playa, in a remote part of Death Valley, is a dry lakebed that turns a shallow, slick surface after the occasional rain.The stones scattered across the dry lake, also known as ""sailing stones"" or ""sliding rocks,"" leave behind long trails etched into the soft mud as if they had been propelled by an invisible force.These trails can extend for tens of meters, often hundreds of meters, sometimes in straight lines or gentle curves, but for decades, nobody has watched them in motion.In 2013 and 2014, a team led by researchers set up on Racetrack Playa GPS-equipped stones, weather stations, and time-lapse cameras. For the first time, they documented rocks actually moving, in the process leaving trails behind. Their 2014 paper, “ Sliding Rocks on Racetrack Playa, Death Valley National Park: First Observation of Rocks in Motion ”, chronicled for the first time the resolution of the long-standing mystery. The movement associated itself with shallow pools of water, forming after rain; freezing temperatures at night; and thin sheets of ice, which form on the playa surface.These mysterious moving stones have puzzled scientists for decades, appearing to defy gravity and logic. So how do massive rocks slide across a nearly flat desert floor? The answer is a precise combination of conditions:This movement continues until the ice disintegrates or the water evaporates, leaving behind the characteristic trails in the mud.Sliding stones don't move every year, only when the rare mix of conditions is just right.Death Valley is one of North America's toughest environments, requiring enough precipitation to create shallow water, severe temperatures to freeze the water at night, and sunlight to melt the ice in the morning. Rock movement occurrences are extremely rare due to the importance of ensuring that all of these components occur in the correct order. As a result, stones may only be moved a few times over a period of years, if not decades.When these boulders move, they leave behind peculiar trails that tell their tale. Some of these trails are straight, some bend gradually, and others intersect each other. The length and direction of these trails would depend on wind direction, patterns of ice breakup, and the duration the ice sheets remained intact.Over time, hundreds of these trails were mapped by scientists, but it was the recording of actual motion that confirmed the cause.Nowadays, the place is considered a bucket list destination for geologists, photographers, and curious tourists. It’s most accessible in cooler months when conditions are milder, and occasionally when rare winter rain brings the sliding stones to life.

Eight men were charged in a large commercial driver exam fraud case in Ontario, with most being of Indian origin after police uncovered an alleged bribery scheme linked to Class A licence road tests in the Greater Toronto Area and Kingston.Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) say the eight accused face a total of 24 Criminal Code charges following a year-long investigation into irregularities in the commercial driver testing system.The investigation began in January 2024 after the Ontario ministry of transportation asked the OPP’s Serious Fraud Office to look into concerns about the testing process for commercial Class A licences.According to police, investigators found that bribes were allegedly arranged in exchange for favourable treatment during road tests for certain applicants.“The Serious Fraud Office investigation revealed that bribes were facilitated in exchange for favourable consideration during specific applicants’ road examinations,” the OPP said.The accused are from several Ontario cities, including Brampton, Oshawa, Georgetown, North York, Caledon and Kingston.Police allege the scheme allowed some applicants to receive favourable treatment during road tests, helping them obtain or attempt to obtain commercial Class A licences dishonestly.Class A licences allow drivers to operate large vehicles such as tractor-trailers for long distances, which police say makes the integrity of the testing process a serious public safety issue, especially after some fatal accidents caused by immigrant drivers last year.All eight accused have been released from custody and are scheduled to appear in court.","Eight men have been charged in a large commercial driver exam fraud case in ontario.

Allegations surface through social media posts

NFL and Chiefs acknowledge situation

Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice has chosen not to speak publicly after serious abuse allegations surfaced online from his former girlfriend earlier this month. The situation has drawn league-wide attention, with the NFL confirming it is monitoring developments, even as no formal charges have been filed so far.Rice has remained silent despite repeated attempts by the media to get his side of the story.The controversy began when Rice’s ex-girlfriend Dacoda Nichole Jones, shared a series of Instagram posts showing visible bruises and injuries on her face and body. In her captions, Jones described years of alleged abuse and claimed the incidents occurred in Kansas and Texas.While she did not directly name Rice in the posts, she identified the alleged abuser as the father of her two children which makes the connection clear. Jones later deleted the posts without offering an explanation, which added another layer of uncertainty to the situation.The former couple reportedly dated for nearly eight years and share two children together.Rashee Rice was recently approached by reporters from TMZ Sports at Los Angeles International Airport. When asked directly about the allegations, including whether he had ever harmed anyone, Rice did not respond and walked away without comment.His silence has been interpreted by some as a legal precaution, especially with the NFL now involved. Others believe it reflects advice from his representatives as the situation remains under review.So far, he has not released any statement through the Chiefs or his personal channels.The NFL confirmed that it is aware of the allegations and is in communication with the Kansas City Chiefs. The league stated that the matter will be reviewed under its personal conduct policy.However, since no criminal complaint or charges have been filed, the NFL is not required to take immediate action. The Chiefs also issued a brief statement acknowledging awareness of the reports but declined further comment.Rice has been under criticism off the field before. He was in a high-speed car crash in Texas in 2024 and later pleaded guilty to felony charges linked to the crash. That case led to a suspension earlier in the 2025 season.On the field, he finished the 2025 campaign with modest numbers after returning late in the season. While the Chiefs still view him as a talented playmaker, continued controversy could complicate his future with the franchise.","Kansas city chiefs wide receiver rashee rice has chosen not to speak publicly after serious abuse allegations surfaced online.

The Laerdal Tunnel: Longest road tunnel designed for drivers in Norway



How the Lærdal Tunnel’s lighting reduces driver fatigue





Advanced safety features inside the Lærdal Tunnel







Traveling through tunnels is usually just a normal part of a trip, but the Laerdal Tunnel in Norway is something special. The tunnel is 15.2 miles long and goes under a mountain range that looks like it came straight out of a movie. Drivers can go through the tunnel for up to 20 minutes without ever seeing the sun. The tunnel connects the towns of Laerdal and Aurland. It is an important way to get from Oslo in the east to Bergen in the west. Every year, thousands of people who work, visit, or move goods through the tunnel. The tunnel is not just a way to get from one place to another. People all over the world call it an engineering marvel because of its size, shape, and usefulness, which make it easy for people to get around. It shows that infrastructure can put people first, even when the ground is hard to work with.According to The Sun reports, after about five years of building, the Laerdal Tunnel opened in November 2000. It cost 1.08 billion Norwegian kroner, which is about £80 million. It goes through a mountain range with peaks that are 1,400 meters high, making it the longest road tunnel in the world. Engineers had to make sure that the structure was safe and that drivers could drive comfortably over such a long underground stretch without losing their focus or getting lost.Unlike most tunnels, Laerdal is not a boring tube. The design shows that the people who made it knew that people can get bored in long, closed spaces. To fix this, the tunnel has sections that are wider and more like caves at regular intervals. These parts give drivers a break from the view and a place to pull over.A big new feature of the Laerdal Tunnel is its innovative lighting system. The lights are warm blue and orange tones that illuminate different areas instead of relying on a long, monotonous strip of white fluorescent lights. These creatively coloured rooms make the drive less boring and visually stimulating, which helps keep drivers from getting tired, drowsy, or distracted and encourages them to stay awake and alert. Some of these rooms are spacious enough for cars to park safely and comfortably. This thoughtful design gives long-haul drivers or anyone who is tired a chance to take a short rest break, stretch, and rejuvenate before moving on. The tunnel makes the long underground passage safer, more comfortable, and remarkably unique, creating a one-of-a-kind experience for all drivers passing through.Safety has always been the most important thing in the Laerdal Tunnel. The tunnel has a modern ventilation system that makes sure the air is clean and easy to breathe the whole way through. Fifteen cameras watch traffic and accidents so that help can be sent right away if needed. If there is an accident, automated systems can quickly close the tunnel to stop other problems from happening.There are also safety points every 500 meters that include fire extinguishers, emergency phones, and other critical safety equipment. This is important because it means that drivers can get help right away if they need it. The Laerdal Tunnel is not only the longest road tunnel in the world, but it is also one of the safest. Everyone knows the Lærdal Tunnel as a tourist attraction and as a practical road. Many reviews mention how beautiful the colored tunnels are and how cool it is to drive through the mountains for 20 minutes. Those who visit the tunnel often say that they are always amazed by how large and well-constructed it is. Some even say that it feels more like an adventure than a ride.The tunnel itself is a reason for people who have never visited Norway to visit the country. It proves how much Norway is interested in new ideas, in building, and in making driving easier.","The laerdal tunnel in norway is 15.2 miles long and goes under a mountain range that looks like it came straight out of a movie.
