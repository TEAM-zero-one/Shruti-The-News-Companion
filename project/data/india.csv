"Tigress survives years with snare knotted around stomach, raises healthy cubs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tigress-survives-years-with-snare-knotted-around-stomach-raises-healthy-cubs/articleshow/120743307.cms,"PILIBHIT: A tigress whose lower back was cinched for years by a metallic snare - an injury so severe it had reshaped her into a silhouette almost cheetah-like - continued not only to survive but to give birth to healthy cubs , a rare feat observed recently in the Surai forest range of Terai East forest division. First sighted with the embedded snare in 2022, and rediscovered in Dec 2023, the tigress stunned forest officials who, as they prepared to dart her for rescue, witnessed her carrying a cub gently in her mouth - a moment that suspended the operation and reframed the story they thought they were about to tell.From the beginning, her case defied expectation. The metallic loop had lodged itself deep in her lumbosacral region, an area crucial for mobility and balance. Yet, despite the physical restrictions - and the internal damage that experts later suspected - she moved through her habitat with enough stealth and strength to hunt, mate, conceive, and rear a litter. Drone surveillance launched after the interrupted rescue attempt confirmed what seemed almost improbable: four cubs, nursed and nurtured, thriving in her care.Today, three of those cubs, now around sixteen months old, roam the forest with their mother, who continues to hunt and provide for them with a tenacity that belies the injury written into her body. To the team observing her, and to the wider circle of wildlife biologists, her survival - and that of her cubs - has become a living case study in endurance, adaptation, and the hidden margins of possibility in the wild.At the Wildlife Institute of India, where a detailed plan for her future is under discussion, Dr Parag Nigam told TOI that the need to rescue the tigress remained urgent. ""The metallic snare poses serious physical and spinal risks that could worsen with time,"" he said, adding that her images would be sent to WII's tiger cell to cross-reference her history with national tiger databases.Veterinary experts studying her case noted the narrow anatomical escape that had allowed her to survive and reproduce. Dr R K Singh, former veterinary head of Kanpur zoo, explained that the snare's position likely spared her kidneys and ovaries, trapping mostly the intestinal loops instead.","Tigress' lower back was cinched for years by a metallic snare.

SRINAGAR: National Conference MLA Sajad Shafi alleged Tuesday that the mother of Shaurya Chakra awardee Mudasir Ahmed Sheikh , the J&K Special Operations Group constable who died fighting terrorists in 2022, was among those escorted out of their villages in Uri as part of the govt-ordered exercise to deport citizens of Pakistan or PoK.Baramulla Police contested the allegation, saying “reports circulating on social media regarding the alleged repatriation of the mother of Shaheed constable Mudasir Ahmad @ Bindaas are false, baseless, and categorically denied”.Shafi, who represents Uri in the J&K assembly, said he was shocked to find Shameema Akhtar’s name on the list of prospective deportees. “She gave a brave son to this country,"" he said. “Many other women of my constituency have been asked to return to Pakistan without delay.”Shameema, who travelled to Delhi along with her husband in 2023 to receive their son Mudasir’s posthumous Shaurya Chakra from President Droupadi Murmu, has been living in J&K for 40 years. Her parents were from PoK, locals said.Mudasir had been part of a joint anti-terror operation with the Army in north Kashmir’s Baramulla on May 25, 2022, in which he helped gun down three Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists before being fatally shot.Another woman on the deportation list, Aliza Rafiq, said she moved to Kashmir from PoK in 2013 under the rehabilitation policy introduced during CM Omar Abdullah’s first term in office. She settled in Bandipora’s Nadihal, her husband Mohammad Rafiq Bhat’s ancestral village in north Kashmir, with their two children. A third daughter was born in J&K.Rafiq had crossed over to PoK in 2003 – he was 18 at the time – for arms training. He married Aliza and lived there for a decade before choosing surrender and rehabilitation.""I have received a notice asking me to leave the country with my two older daughters,” Aliza said. “The notice states that any child born here must be left behind. How can I abandon my third daughter, who is 10?”The rehabilitation policy, announced in 2010, had been billed as a major confidence-building measure for J&K. It enabled former terrorists who had settled in PoK to return via four approved routes: Poonch–Rawalakote, Uri–Muzaffarabad, Wagah (Punjab) and Delhi airport.Although widely publicised, the policy lacked clear implementation guidelines. Of the more than 1,200 applications, only about 350 were approved, according to officials. Most returnees, including Rafiq, used the Nepal route to enter India based on a purportedly informal understanding between Delhi and Islamabad.PDP president and ex-CM Mehbooba Mufti said the post-Pahalgam govt directive to deport all Pakistani nationals from India was riddled with “humanitarian concerns”, particularly in J&K. “Many of those affected are women who came to India 30-40 years ago, married Indian citizens, raised families, and have long been part of our society. We urge the govt to reconsider this decision, adopting a compassionate approach regarding women, children and the elderly,” she said.CPM’s M Y Tarigami, too, called for a rethink. “Deporting women from Pakistan and PoK who came here after the govt rolled out the rehabilitation policy in 2010 is inhumane. These women, married to local Kashmiri men, have built their lives here, living peacefully since their arrival,” he said.",J&k special operations group constable mudasir ahmed sheikh died fighting terrorists in 2022.

The REAL ID Act was enacted by Congress in 2005 in response to security concerns following the September 11 attacks. It requires the establishment of minimum security standards for the issuance of state-issued driver’s licenses and identification cards. Beginning May 7, 2025, US residents aged 18 and older will be required to present a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or state ID, or another acceptable form of identification, to board federally regulated domestic flights or gain access to certain federal facilities.Although originally set to take effect earlier, the enforcement deadline was postponed multiple times to allow states and residents more time to comply. As the deadline approaches, it is crucial to understand what REAL ID is, how to check if your ID is compliant, and how to apply for one, including eligibility for online application.Not all states allow REAL ID applications online. Many require an in-person visit for the initial issuance due to document verification requirements. However, some states permit online upgrades if:Check your state DMV or licensing agency website to confirm if online application or renewal is available.To apply for a REAL ID, you must provide original or certified copies of the following:Some states may have additional documentation requirements, so consult your local DMV for specifics.The REAL ID Act was a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission, intended to enhance security by making it harder to forge state-issued identification. It mandates that states verify specific documentation and use secure card production and issuance practices before issuing IDs.After May 7, 2025, a REAL ID or an acceptable alternative will be required for the following purposes:It’s important to note that a REAL ID is not required for voting, driving, banking, or applying for federal benefits such as Social Security.Yes. Beginning May 7, 2025, you must present a REAL ID-compliant license or an approved alternative identification to pass through TSA security checkpoints at US airports for domestic flights.If you do not have a REAL ID, you may use one of the following acceptable alternatives to board domestic flights or access secure federal facilities:A REAL ID-compliant card has a star in the upper-right corner. If your card lacks this star, it is not compliant and will not be accepted for REAL ID purposes. However, Enhanced Driver’s Licenses (EDLs)—issued by a few states—are acceptable even without the star marking, as they comply with federal security requirements.Only five states currently issue EDLs:EDLs are REAL ID-compliant and also allow land and sea border crossings between the US and Canada, Mexico, or the Caribbean under the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative.Yes. States continue to offer non-REAL ID-compliant cards, often labeled “Not for Federal Identification.” These can still be used for driving and other non-federal purposes but will not be accepted for air travel or entry into certain federal buildings after May 7, 2025.The final enforcement date is May 7, 2025. After this date, only REAL ID-compliant cards or approved alternatives will be accepted for TSA screening and federal facility access. Starting May 7, 2025, TSA and other federal agencies will only accept IDs that meet REAL ID security standards. Travelers presenting non-compliant IDs will be denied access to domestic flights and certain government buildings unless they provide an acceptable alternative.Yes. As of now, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and US territories including Puerto Rico, Guam, the US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands are compliant and issuing REAL ID cards.No. A REAL ID cannot be used for international land, air, or sea travel. A US passport is still required for:No. REAL IDs are not valid for international cruise departures. Cruise travelers must carry a valid passport or passport card for identification.Yes, but only for international travel. If traveling within the US, you need either a REAL ID-compliant license or an acceptable alternative—not both. However, a passport remains mandatory for traveling abroad.Yes. Enhanced Driver’s Licenses (EDLs) issued by the five eligible states (MI, MN, NY, VT, WA) are considered acceptable for all REAL ID purposes, including air travel, accessing federal facilities, and entering nuclear power plants—even though they may not bear the star marking.As of December 17, 2018, states are permitted to issue REAL ID-compliant cards to citizens of the Freely Associated States (FAS), which include:To qualify, FAS citizens must be lawfully admitted under the Compact of Free Association and meet all identity and residency requirements set forth by the REAL ID Act.","The real id act was enacted by congress in 2005 in response to security concerns following the september 11 attacks.

On Timmapur’s terror remarks

BENGALURUHome minister G Parameshwara Tuesday blamed BJP workers for triggering an incident in Belagavi that led to chief minister Siddaramaiah making a gesture as if to slap a police officer before pulling himself together after security was breached.“The preliminary information I have is that some BJP workers from Mahila Morcha (women's wing) entered the venue sporting Congress shawls . That is why the CM was upset,” Parameshwara said.He said the group was quiet when senior Congress functionaries spoke but waved black flags and raised slogans when Siddaramaiah began to address the gathering. He said he has directed Alok Mohan, Karnataka DGP & IG, to examine whether there were any lapses in security arrangements .He also criticised BJP, questioning the moral right of its workers to don Congress shawls. “BJP workers should have entered the venue wearing their party shawls and not Congress ones. If they had come to the venue wearing BJP shawls, then police would have known who they were,” he said. “What moral right does a BJP member have to wear a Congress shawl?”On the controversy surround ing remarks made by excise minister RB Timmapur on the Pahalgam terror attack — he said there is “no proper information” on whether terrorists singled out Hindus to kill them — Parameshwara said functionaries should “refrain from giving personal opinions on national issues”.“We need to be careful while speaking. This concerns national security ,” Parameshwara said.Defending Congress’ record on national security, Parameshwara said the party has made “immense sacrifices” and does not need lectures from critics. “No one else has made the kind of sacrifices for national security that Congress has. We don’t need to be taught lessons on this by others,” he said.","Home minister g parameshwara blamed bjp workers for triggering an incident in belagavi.

US government's new policy terminates international students' legal status,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-governments-new-policy-terminates-international-students-legal-status/articleshow/120747708.cms,"File Photo (Photo: AP)

Washington, Apr 30 (AP) The US government has begun shedding new light on a crackdown on international students, spelling out how it targeted thousands of people and laying out the grounds for terminating their legal status. The new details emerged in lawsuits filed by some of the students who suddenly had their status cancelled in recent weeks with little explanation.In the past month, foreign students around the US have been rattled to learn their records had been removed from a student database maintained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement . Some went into hiding for fear of being picked up by immigration authorities or abandoned their studies to return home.On Friday, after mounting court challenges, federal officials said the government was restoring international students' legal status while it developed a framework to guide future terminations. In a court filing Monday, it shared the new policy: a document issued over the weekend with guidance on a range of reasons students' status can be cancelled, including the revocation of the visas they used to enter the USBrad Banias, an immigration attorney representing a student whose status was terminated, said the new guidelines vastly expand ICE's authority beyond previous policy, which did not count visa revocation as grounds for losing legal status.""This just gave them carte blanche to have the State Department revoke a visa and then deport those students even if they've done nothing wrong,"" Banias said.Many of the students who had visas revoked or lost their legal status said they had only minor infractions on their record, including driving infractions. Some did not know why they were targeted at all.Lawyers for the government provided some explanation at a hearing Tuesday in the case of Banias' client Akshar Patel, an international student studying information systems in Texas. Patel's status was terminated - and then reinstated - this month, and he is seeking a preliminary court ruling to keep him from being deported.In court filings and in the hearing, Department of Homeland Security officials said they ran the names of student visa holders through the National Crime Information Center, an FBI-run database that contains reams of information related to crimes. It includes the names of suspects, missing persons and people who have been arrested, even if they have never been charged with a crime or had charges dropped.In total, about 6,400 students were identified in the database search, US District Judge Ana Reyes said in the hearing Tuesday. One of the students was Patel, who had been pulled over and charged with reckless driving in 2018. The charge was ultimately dropped - information that is also in NCIC.Patel appears in a spreadsheet with 734 students whose names had come up in NCIC. That spreadsheet was forwarded to a Homeland Security official, who, within 24 hours of receiving it, replied: ""Please terminate all in SEVIS."" That's a different database listing foreigners who have legal status as students in the US.Reyes said the short time frame suggested that no one had reviewed the records individually to find out why the students' names came up in NCIC.""All of this could have been avoided if someone had taken a beat,"" said Reyes, who was appointed by President Joe Biden. She said the government had demonstrated ""an utter lack of concern for individuals who have come into this country.""When colleges discovered the students no longer had legal status, it prompted chaos and confusion. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school. In some cases, colleges told students to stop working or taking classes and warned them they could be deported.Still, government attorneys said the change in the database did not mean the students actually lost legal status, even though some of the students were labeled ""failure to maintain status."" Instead, lawyers said, it was intended to be an ""investigative red flag.""""Mr. Patel is lawfully present in the US,"" Andre Watson of the Department of Homeland Security said. ""He is not subject to immediate detention or removal.""Reyes declined to issue a preliminary injunction and urged lawyers from both sides to come to a settlement to ensure Patel could stay in the US.","Us government sheds new light on crackdown on international students.
