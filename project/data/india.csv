Toothpick! Twiggy! Why does thin-shaming get a free pass?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/toothpick-twiggy-why-does-thin-shaming-get-a-free-pass/articleshow/127442841.cms,".

“How are you a Bengali girl if you don’t have a round chubby face?”

“Careful on the terrace or the wind may blow you off…”

“Do you need a belt, or will a rubber band do?” “Sure it’s not anorexia?”

Over the years, I’ve heard them all. Sometimes, all in the same afternoon. Usually delivered with a laugh. Always a laugh. Which seems to make it acceptable.Being thin comes with a peculiar licence for casual body policing. Despite a culture that idolises skinny bodies plastered across popular media, thinness turns out to be desirable in theory and rather suspect up close. We celebrate it on runways and screens, then mock it in real life.Let me clarify. I never quite fitted the Bengali stereotype of women with soft, rounded curves or the cherished idea of looking visibly ‘well-fed’ on ‘maach bhaat’. I was born thin, stayed thin, and now in my forties, still thin. Not because I’m trying to “maintain” myself, as many assume but because my metabolism has perhaps always done its own thing.Contrary to popular belief, I eat. Well. Often. With enthusiasm. I’ve never dieted, chased size-zero, or feared carbs. I binge on cheese and fries when the mood strikes and accept second helpings of samosa-jalebi from well-meaning friends determined to “fatten me up”.I am also routinely informed that lean women are objects of envy. So far, so good.Except that this is where the compliments end and the comments begin.It started before I was old enough to register it. Standing out in a family of rounded figures, relatives wondered aloud if something in my genes had gone astray. In my teenage years, someone called me a “toothpick”. It took me twenty years to realise this had a name: thin shaming. At the time, it was just one of many things said casually, jokingly, even affectionately. “Bag of bones”, “matchsticks”, “twiggy”, “walking X-ray”.Even after ‘skinny shaming’ entered public vocabulary, the repertoire merely evolved. “Are you ill or something?” “How long will you diet?” And occasionally, for variety, “Trying to become a model?” said aloud at family gatherings, classrooms and later, offices.Because here’s the thing. You wouldn’t call someone fat to their face anymore. We’ve been trained out of that, at least socially. But calling someone “too thin” is still fair game.I’d usually let these jokes land. But once, a distant relative surveyed me at a family dinner and announced, with the solemn air of a doctor, that I resembled a skeleton, apparently concerned that I wasn’t eating enough. I smiled sweetly and suggested she looked rather like a baby elephant. She was offended. I was lectured on sensitivity.What surprised me though was when she apologised later. It had finally occurred to her how casually offensive her own remark had been.Pray, why are there bodies you protect, and bodies you’re allowed to comment on freely?And sometimes, it doesn’t stop at words. A woman at a party I was acquainted with conducted a quick inspection of my midriff, tugging at the band of my dress to check if I was wearing a body shaper. When her investigation yielded nothing, she laughed and asked if I even had a stomach.Another time, a consulate official insisted on carrying my plate at a reception. I mistook it for old-school courtesy until he winked at how “tiny” I was. I stood there plate-less, weighing whether to thank him, laugh along, or recoil.Complete strangers — at a train station, during a spa therapy, in a theatre loo — have offered meal plans I never asked for. People also feel entitled to audit what you eat, when you eat, and how much makes it from plate to mouth. If you’re having a salad, there must be an eating disorder. If you skip dessert, someone will insist you fear calories. If you go for it, it’s followed by a triumphant, “Good, you need it.”Strangely, after all that caring, thin is automatically deemed fit. And fine. Lucky, even. Any health complaint is dismissed as exaggeration or attention-seeking. “Just eat more,” they say, because any anomaly is self-inflicted or worse, imaginary.Once, an undiagnosed allergy spiralled because my symptoms were dismissed as a side effect of being skinny and “not eating enough”. I was handed a food chart. The allergy worsened. What makes this harder is that it’s rarely acknowledged as harmful.Popular culture hasn’t helped either. I have a yawning dislike for that cheerful body-positive Meghan Trainor song that announces it’s “all about that bass” while swatting skinny women as fake, silicone stick figures no man should possibly want.Which brings me to the deeply irritating ideal that ‘real women have curves’. I’ve always found this baffling. Since when did fat percentage become a qualification for womanhood?By now, I’ve also learnt that no one steps in when thin-shaming happens openly right in the middle of a dinner table or a group chat. Not because people are brutal but because they don’t think it’s unkind. Skinny shaming survives because it doesn’t sound like an insult. It sounds like banter, teasing or a backhanded compliment from someone “only joking” or “just worried about you.”The irony is relentless. This is what pop culture has long sold as “the goal”. The XS silhouette is what runways are built for and AI churns out by the million, and now the Ozempics and Mounjaros promise. And yet, I’ve spent a lifetime feeling awkward inside a body everyone assumes I must love. I do — quite unapologetically — even as I’m habitually guilt-tripped for it.A new AIIMS -ICMR study has finally put numbers to what many like me have lived. Conducted among 1,071 young adults aged 18-30 attending AIIMS outpatient clinics, it found that 47% of underweight participants reported moderate to severe body image distress, almost as high as the 49% reported by those with obesity.I’m outside that age bracket now and don’t get angry anymore. Mostly, I get tired. Tired of explaining my metabolism, justifying my appetite, reassuring people that my blood reports are excellent, of hearing “I wish I had your problem” from people who don’t see it as a problem at all.I’ve even curated a bagful of skinny jokes over the years and now ask folks to get more creative when they reach for the hackneyed gags about being blown away by a chance breeze. Somewhere along the way, I reclaimed my right to decide what my body is and is not.But not everyone can. And that’s the part we don’t talk about.","Being thin comes with a peculiar licence for casual body policing.

Cannot dismiss blood pressure as a lifestyle disease and deny disability pension to military officer: High court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cannot-dismiss-blood-pressure-as-a-lifestyle-disease-and-deny-disability-pension-to-military-officer-high-court/articleshow/127428957.cms,"Image: IANS

NEW DELHI: Disability pension to a military officer suffering from blood pressure issues cannot be denied merely by terming primary hypertension a lifestyle disorder, Delhi high court has observed, rejecting the Union govt's challenge to an Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) order that upheld a retired IAF officer's entitlement.""It must be noted that lifestyle varies from individual to individual. Hence, a mere statement that the disease is a lifestyle disorder cannot be a sufficient reason to deny the grant of disability pension unless the medical board has duly examined and recorded the particulars relevant to the individual concerned,"" Justices V Kameswar Rao and Manmeet P S Arora observed.The officer joined IAF in Oct 1981 and was discharged from service in March 2019. His claim for disability pension was opposed by the Centre, which argued that the officer developed the disability in a peace area and that it was neither attributable to nor aggravated by military service. The court observed that the board failed to explain why hypertension was categorised as a lifestyle disorder. ""The medical board must record its reasons and findings while discharging the onus placed upon it,"" the court said.","The officer joined iaf in oct 1981 and was discharged from service in march 2019.

If you want life, take risks, says recipient



.

NEW DELHI: Preeti Unhale, 51, completed 25 years with a donor heart on Jan 23, 2026, becoming India's longest-living heart transplant survivor - a landmark considering that heart transplants were rare, donor awareness was limited and long-term survival remained uncertain when she underwent the procedure.Originally from MP, Unhale came to AIIMS in 2000 after exhausting treatment options at home and in Mumbai. She was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy - a condition in which the heart muscle becomes weak and enlarged, reducing its ability to pump blood effectively and leading to heart failure. She was told a heart transplant was her only chance. At AIIMS, she met cardiothoracic surgeon Dr P Venugopal and cardiologist Dr K K Talwar. ""For the first time, I heard the words, 'You will be fine',"" she recalled. She stayed in Delhi for treatment - and has since lived here.Dr Talwar told TOI that Unhale had arrived in an extremely critical condition. ""She had married barely two and a half years earlier and came to us with hope after being refused everywhere else,"" he said. With little clinical guidance available at the time, doctors evaluated her extensively before a donor heart became available.""For end-stage heart failure, transplantation is the definitive answer. Survival is around 85% at five years. She has completed 25,"" he said. The transplant, performed in Jan 2001 by using the heart of a brain-dead teenage donor, happened at a time when outcomes were uncertain.""There was no guidance then. Success rates were low, and there were hardly any survivors to talk to. People discouraged us, saying transplants don't last long. But there was no other option,"" Unhale said.""If you want life - and a good quality of life - you take that risk."" Her husband, an Indian Forest Service officer, sought a transfer to Delhi so that the family could stay close to AIIMS. ""Family support was critical,"" she said.Life after transplant meant lifelong discipline. Unhale takes daily immunosuppressants and has faced multiple rejection episodes, including a major one in 2006-07 when she had to be rushed to AIIMS late at night.Over the years, she developed kidney problems, steroid-related bone damage, vascular necrosis and facial paralysis - each managed with sustained medical care. ""This survival isn't mine alone,"" she said. ""It belongs to doctors, nurses, technicians and even sanitation staff. It takes a system to save one life,"" she said. Preeti Unhale has counselled heart transplant patients across India, helping bridge the information gap she once faced. Her message is unequivocal: ""If doctors advise a transplant, there is no other option. Donors are rare - if you get one, say yes immediately. Live fully, but with discipline. We have been given a second chance.""","Preeti unhale, 51, completed 25 years with a donor heart on jan 23, 2026.

Smriti Mandhana opens up on 'love', World Cup win and more

NEW DELHI: Fresh controversy has surfaced around the cancellation of Indian cricketer Smriti Mandhana ’s wedding with singer-composer Palaash Muchhal, following serious allegations made by actor-producer Vidnyan Mane. Mane has accused Muchhal of infidelity and financial misconduct, claiming he was cheated of more than Rs 40 lakh in connection with an unreleased film project. A formal complaint has been filed in Sangli, Maharashtra.Smriti and Muchhal were initially scheduled to tie the knot on November 23, 2025. The wedding was first postponed citing health emergencies in both families before being officially called off in December 2025.In an interview with Hindustan Times, the 34-year-old alleged that the relationship between Mandhana and Muchhal broke down after a shocking incident during wedding festivities in November 2025.“I was at the wedding celebrations (November, 23, 2025) when he was caught red-handed with another woman in bed. Bhayanak scene tha, he was beaten up by the Indian female cricketers. The entire family is chindi chor. I thought he’d get married and settle in Sangli, but it has completely backfired on me.”Mane further claimed he is a childhood friend of Smriti Mandhana and was introduced to Muchhal through her family.Mane also levelled allegations of financial coercion against the Muchhal family, stating that he was pressured to invest additional money into a stalled film project.“When I met his mother (Amita Muchhal) last month, she said the budget to release the movie has now increased to Rs 1.5 crore. They asked me to invest another Rs 10 lakh or I wouldn’t get any money back. They started blackmailing me and threatened to throw me out of the film, thus I was forced to file a complaint,” he said.According to Mane, communication with the family stopped entirely after the wedding was cancelled.“After the wedding was called off, the family blocked me from everywhere. I found out that other artistes from the movie had not received payment they were due to receive either. I had heard of directors fleecing producers in the film industry but this is complete theft,” he added.Mane also asserted that he has evidence to back his claims. “I have saved all proofs including my chats and phone conversations that I’m willing to share with the police and the media,” he said.Muchhal later issued a response through an Instagram story, firmly denying all accusations. ""In light of the allegations made by Sangli-based Vidnyan Mane on social media, I wish to state that these claims against me are entirely baseless and factually incorrect. They have been made with malicious intent to tarnish my reputation, and they will not go unchallenged. My lawyer, Shreyansh Mithare, is exploring all legal avenues, and this matter will be dealt with strictly through the appropriate legal channels,” Muchhal wrote.Amid widespread speculation over the reasons behind the split, both parties later issued separate statements confirming the cancellation. Smriti stated that she needed to “clarify that the wedding is called off” and requested privacy, while Muchhal said, “I have decided to move on in my life and step back from my personal relationship. Its been very difficult for me to see people react so easily on baseless rumours about something which has been most sacred to me. Its the most difficult phase of my life and I will deal with it gracefully holding on to my beliefs.”",Smriti mandhana's wedding with palaash muchhal has been called off.

NEW DELHI: Light rain and a thunderstorm on Friday provided slight relief from pollution in the national capital, but air quality remained in the “poor” category, with the AQI recorded at 297 at 7 am, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Light rain also lashed Ghaziabad and Noida.This marked a marginal improvement from Thursday morning, when the AQI had been in the “very poor” category at 312.Several parts of the national capital continued to register poor air quality, with Anand Vihar at 317, Ashok Vihar 335, Wazirpur 351, Punjabi Bagh 326, RK Puram 315, Bawana 342, ITO 266, Chandni Chowk 326, and Dwarka Sector 8 316, the CPCB reported.Meanwhile, the temperature in Delhi was around 16.4°C at 7 am, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Under the AQI classification, readings are categorised as follows: 0–50 ‘Good’, 51–100 ‘Satisfactory’, 101–200 ‘Moderate’, 201–300 ‘Poor’, 301–400 ‘Very Poor’, and 401–500 ‘Severe’.Thursday had been unusually warm, with the mercury soaring to 27.1°C, about seven degrees above normal, marking the warmest January day in seven years.The high temperature was attributed to persistent warm easterly winds and clear skies, which increased sunshine hours.“Westerly winds are cold, while easterly winds are warm during this time of the year,” a weather official explained.With multiple spells of rain expected on Friday, the temperature is likely to drop. Officials said the maximum temperature is forecast to fall to 18-20°C on Friday and further to 16-18°C on Saturday.The rainy spells, accompanied by cloud cover, are also expected to bring down Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) to the poor category on Friday and to moderate by Saturday, if the predictions hold true.The IMD has issued a yellow alert for rain across the city. “Another round of very light to light rain is likely towards the afternoon or evening on Friday,” officials added, advising residents to remain cautious of strong winds and localized thunderstorms.A day earlier, the Sub-Committee on the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) revoked all Stage III measures across Delhi-NCR with immediate effect on January 22, following improvements in air quality and favorable forecast trends.A statement from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change said: “The Sub-Committee had invoked Stage III of GRAP on January 16, 2026, after a deterioration in Delhi’s average AQI.” Since then, air quality has shown a downward trend. According to the daily AQI Bulletin from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the average AQI improved from 378 on January 20 to 330 on January 21 and 322 on January 22.Considering this improving trend, and based on air quality and meteorological forecasts from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), the CAQM Sub-Committee convened today to review the situation.","Light rain and a thunderstorm on friday provided slight relief from pollution in the national capital.

After two months of prolonged treatment, Lohar resumed his journey back home to Sambalpur on Jan 19.Lohar's journey highlights the harsh realities faced by the poor and elderly in accessing basic healthcare and transport facilities, even as it stood as a powerful testament to a spouse's devotion.Another twist in fate saw the couple meet with a mishap in Cuttack's Tangi area. A vehicle brushed the rickshaw while overtaking, and Jyoti fell on the road and hit her head, but Lohar did not sustain any injury.He took Jyoti to the local Tangi community health centre to bandage the wound. The hospital provided food and allowed them to stay overnight to avoid the cold. They resumed their journey on Jan 20.Tangi SHO Bikash Sethi spotted the couple and offered to help Lohar get a vehicle, but he ""politely refused"".

'Rahul Gandhi stands exposed':

BJP

NEW DELHI: Former Union minister Shakeel Ahmad, who resigned from the Congress in November 2025, on Saturday launched a scathing attack on senior party leader Rahul Gandhi , calling him “darpok” (coward) and “insecure.”Ahmad also described Gandhi, a former Congress president and the current leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha, as “dictatorial” and “non-democratic.”""Rahul Gandhi is a coward and an insecure person. He does not get that 'boss feeling' before anyone who is senior to him or has a big public support. He is uncomfortable with any such person and is thus dictatorial and not democratic,"" Ahmad told PTI.The ex-Congress general secretary further highlighted how the Raebareli MP, who was party chief during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, even lost from his own Amethi constituency, a traditional Gandhi family bastion, and attributed the defeat to Gandhi's “attitude.”Ahmad, a three-time MLA and two-time MP from Bihar, also claimed that he did not come across anyone alleging that their names were removed from the voter list during the Special Intensive Revision exercise in the state last year.The veteran politician resigned from the grand old party just days before the results of the Bihar assembly election, in which it won only six of the 61 seats it contested as part of the RJD-led opposition alliance.The ruling NDA swept the state.Seizing on Ahmad's remarks, the BJP said they have ""exposed"" Gandhi.""Shakeel Ahmad has exposed Rahul Gandhi. Rahul Gandhi keeps showing that he is the most tolerant and democratic person, but the reality is something else. He is the most dictatorial person and has the same Emergency-mindset that Indira Gandhi had,"" BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla posted on X.Responding to Ahmad's claim that he did not find any voter alleging their name was removed from the electoral rolls during the SIR in Bihar, Poonawalla slammed Gandhi, saying the Congress leader made ""baseless"" allegations of 'vote chori' to shift the blame for his party's defeat onto ""others.""","Former union minister shakeel ahmad calls rahul gandhi a ""coward"" and ""insecure"" he also describes the current leader of opposition as 'dictatorial' and 'non-democratic' the bjp says ahmad's remarks have ""exposed"" gandhi.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127410380,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-45522,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Beyond the rulebook

When the University Grants Commission ( UGC ), the statutory body under the Union education ministry that regulates universities and colleges, notified its Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026, it introduced a new set of rules that will apply across campuses nationwide.The regulations govern how colleges and universities must prevent, identify, and respond to discrimination involving students, teachers, and staff.On paper, the objective sounds straightforward. It seeks to ensure that no student, teacher, or staff member is denied dignity or opportunity in higher education because of identity.In practice, however, the new regulations reach deep into the everyday functioning of campuses, shaping everything from admissions and hostels to classrooms, committees, and corridors.The 2026 framework replaces the UGC’s earlier equity rules and shifts the burden of compliance squarely onto institutions and their leadership.Heads of universities and colleges are no longer just administrators; they are now the first line of accountability in preventing and responding to discrimination. New structures, new reporting mechanisms, and strict timelines are written into the rulebook, backed by the threat of serious penalties for non-compliance.Yet, as has often been the case with regulations aimed at correcting long-standing social inequities, the real questions lie beneath the stated intent.How wide is the definition of discrimination? How much discretion do institutional committees enjoy? What happens when complaints are contested, or when the process itself causes harm? And how prepared are campuses to balance speed, sensitivity, and fairness? And is it discriminatory against the non-reserved General Class students?The objective clause sets the tone for the entire framework. It seeks to eradicate discrimination only on specified grounds like religion, race, caste, gender, place of birth, and disability.The word “only” is significant, as it confines the scope of the regulations to discrimination based on specified identity grounds, excluding general grievances or academic disputes.At the same time, the regulations explicitly prioritise certain groups, including:This prioritisation reflects a remedial approach, focusing on historically disadvantaged communities, while formally keeping the protection available to all stakeholders.The definitions section is one of the most consequential parts of the regulations.“Discrimination” is defined broadly to include not only explicit acts but also implicit, indirect, or structural forms of unfair treatment.It extends to actions that have the effect of impairing equality or violating human dignity, even if discriminatory intent is not overt.“Caste-based discrimination” is defined as discrimination against members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes.Importantly, the regulation does not create separate categories of discrimination for different groups but subsumes them within a common framework.“Equity” is defined as providing a level playing field for all stakeholders with respect to rights and opportunities.Together, these definitions significantly expand the interpretive space available to committees tasked with examining complaints. At the same time, the breadth of these definitions leaves substantial discretion with institutional committees.Terms such as implicit or indirect discrimination, structural unfairness, and impairment of dignity are not further qualified in the regulations, offering limited guidance on thresholds of proof or standards of assessment.This ambiguity may allow flexibility in addressing complex forms of disadvantage, but it also opens the door to uneven interpretation across institutions, particularly in contested cases where intent is disputed or where academic or administrative decisions intersect with allegations of discrimination.Every higher education institution (HEI) is required to establish an Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC). The Centre is tasked with a wide range of functions, including policy implementation, counselling, outreach, awareness-building, and grievance handling.Smaller colleges that lack sufficient faculty strength are allowed to rely on the EOC of their affiliating university, ensuring that the requirement applies uniformly across institutions.The EOC is also expected to coordinate with civil society organisations, local administration, police authorities, and legal services bodies. This expansive mandate reflects an attempt to situate campus equity within a broader social and legal ecosystem.Each Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC) must have an Equity Committee, constituted by the head of the institution. Its composition is carefully structured to include:The regulations mandate representation of women, SCs, STs, OBCs, and persons with disabilities within the committee. The committee is required to meet at least twice a year and to review action taken on complaints.The committee’s core role is to inquire into allegations of discrimination and submit a report with findings and recommendations.Beyond formal committees, the regulations introduce two novel mechanisms: Equity Squads and Equity Ambassadors.Equity Squads are smaller, mobile bodies tasked with maintaining vigilance and visiting “vulnerable spots” on campus. Equity Ambassadors are designated individuals in departments, hostels, libraries, and other units who act as nodal points for reporting violations.These mechanisms signal a shift towards continuous monitoring, rather than complaint-driven intervention alone. While intended as preventive measures, they also raise questions about overreach, informal surveillance, and the potential chilling effect on campus interactions.Every HEI must operate a round-the-clock Equity Helpline. Any stakeholder in distress due to discrimination can access it, and confidentiality of the complainant’s identity must be maintained if requested.Where a prima facie case under penal law is disclosed, the information is to be forwarded to the police. This provision effectively links campus grievance mechanisms with the criminal justice system, raising the stakes for both complainants and the accused.The procedure for handling discrimination complaints is tightly time-bound.An aggrieved person can report an incident through an online portal, email, written complaint, or the helpline. Upon receipt, the Equity Committee must meet within 24 hours to decide on the next steps.The committee has 15 working days to submit its report, after which the head of the institution has seven working days to initiate action. In cases involving the head of the institution, the coordinator of the EOC chairs the inquiry.While the timelines aim to ensure prompt action, they also raise concerns about whether complex allegations can be examined thoroughly within such compressed periods.Any person aggrieved by the Equity Committee’s report can appeal to the Ombudsperson within 30 days. The Ombudsperson may appoint an amicus curiae and is expected to dispose of appeals within another 30 days.This appellate mechanism provides an external check on institutional processes. However, it primarily addresses procedural correctness, rather than offering substantive relief for non-tangible harms such as reputational damage or mental distress.The regulations empower the UGC to monitor compliance through inspections, information requests, and national-level committees. Non-compliant institutions face serious consequences, including:These penalties indicate that equity compliance is not optional, but a condition for institutional legitimacy.Despite the breadth of the framework, the regulations are silent on several issues that are likely to shape their reception and operation on campuses. While they lay out detailed mechanisms for receiving and processing complaints, they do not spell out comparable safeguards for non-reserved individuals who may be accused of discrimination, particularly in cases where allegations are contested or later found to be unsubstantiated.There is no explicit provision dealing with malicious or knowingly false complaints, nor is there any guidance on how institutions should distinguish between bona fide grievances and those driven by personal disputes, academic disagreements, or animosity unrelated to identity-based discrimination. The absence of such clarity places a significant burden on institutional committees to exercise judgment, increasing the risk of inconsistent outcomes across campuses.The regulations also do not acknowledge the mental and reputational impact that the complaint process itself can have on the accused. There are no provisions for interim confidentiality for respondents, counselling support during the inquiry, or mechanisms to repair reputational harm if allegations are ultimately not upheld. In tightly knit academic environments, even the initiation of an inquiry can have lasting professional and psychological consequences, irrespective of the final outcome.Another area of concern relates to timelines. While the emphasis on speed is intended to ensure prompt redressal for complainants, the compressed schedule may limit the ability of committees to examine complex factual disputes, especially those involving academic judgment or administrative discretion. In such cases, the pressure to meet deadlines could inadvertently prioritise procedural closure over substantive fairness.The linkage of campus mechanisms with law enforcement, particularly through the equity helpline, further raises the stakes. While intended to ensure swift action in serious cases, this provision may deter open academic engagement or encourage defensive decision-making by administrators wary of escalation beyond the institution.Historically, similar regulatory frameworks in higher education and other sectors have tended to correct outcomes through appellate or judicial review, while leaving the harms caused during the process largely unaddressed. Appeals may overturn findings or set aside penalties, but they rarely compensate for stress, stigma, or disruption suffered in the interim. In the absence of explicit procedural safeguards, this gap is likely to remain.Taken together, these omissions do not negate the objectives of the regulations, but they point to areas where further clarification or supplementary guidelines may be required. How these concerns are handled, whether through institutional practice, regulatory advisories, or future amendments, will play a key role in determining whether the framework strengthens trust on campuses or becomes a source of sustained friction.The question arises because the regulations draw explicit distinctions by prioritising protections for historically disadvantaged groups, while applying a common framework to all stakeholders.Article 14 guarantees equality before the law, but past judicial practice has allowed differential treatment where it is linked to a legitimate objective and applied through non-arbitrary procedures. In that sense, the regulations are framed as remedial rather than exclusionary, focusing on identity-based disadvantage in higher education.However, concerns stem less from the stated objective and more from the structure of implementation. The wide discretion granted to institutional committees, combined with broadly worded definitions of discrimination and the absence of explicit safeguards for those accused, particularly from the unreserved General Class, has led some to question whether outcomes could vary unevenly across campuses. Critics argue that unequal application, rather than unequal text, could create situations where similarly placed individuals are treated differently in practice.The 2026 equity regulations introduce a far-reaching framework for addressing discrimination and inclusion in higher education, expanding the role of institutional mechanisms and regulatory oversight. They formalise a set of duties, procedures, and enforcement tools that universities and colleges will be required to follow.However, the way the framework functions in practice will depend on how institutions interpret and apply its provisions. The manner in which discretion is exercised, timelines are enforced, and contested complaints are handled will shape whether the regulations operate as intended or generate friction within campuses.","Promotion of equity in higher education institutions regulations, 2026.

Raising children in a changed world

For many who grew up in India’s urban and metropolitan households, there was a time when forgetting to remind your father about bringing a chart paper or a political map of India meant a sleepless night of fear. The realisation would strike around 11 pm — too late, of course — followed by the certainty of what the morning would bring: anger, scolding, and a silent walk to school. You would run for your life if your mother caught you hiding test papers, instantly transform into an Oscar-worthy performer furiously finishing notebooks the moment you heard your father’s scooty pull in, or feel a familiar knot in your stomach before a parent-teacher meeting — one where the dreaded remark would glare back across the table:A casual greeting from a classmate in the market could be just as unsettling, inviting raised eyebrows and quiet questions later at home. For those disallowed from using mobile phones before their Class 12 boards, messages were typed secretly on keypad phones, the beep muffled so it wouldn’t be heard — sending elephant jokes or whispered secrets to friends like a thief.These memories are largely rooted in urban, middle-class childhoods — shaped by nuclear families, school-centric lives, and early exposure to rules, routines, and discipline within the home.Parenting experiences across India are far from uniform, but it is within these urban belts that the shift from authority to dialogue is most visible today.Today, phones are so firmly glued to hands that parents often become background noise, their presence acknowledged only when they call you for dinner or scold you for missing chores — an ironic reversal from the days when children moved quietly to avoid detection. And there were always two food choices on the dinner table: one, eat the green vegetables mom cooked; or two, don’t.Today, the same situations play out very differently. A child might suggest a 10-minute delivery app, and parents might laugh instead of scold. Friends are no longer viewed with suspicion but accepted as a natural part of growing up. From parents as unquestioned authority figures — stern, guarded, and rule-bound — to parents who attempt to balance discipline with dialogue, the parent–child dynamic has evolved significantly.Where once there was unspoken hesitation between parent and child, certain music, movies, or topics were strictly off the table. Today, children often assure their parents that such things are “not a big deal,” reflecting a more open, negotiable space where dialogue has replaced silent compliance.There exists one generation that largely obeyed and followed the route map carefully curated by their parents. Another listens, responds, and sometimes rebels — demanding to be understood, not merely permitted. Tech-savvy and exposed to the world far earlier than children once were, today’s young people often see beyond their years, assert their individual needs, and understand their own boundaries with remarkable clarity. It is within this generational shift that parenting styles diverge and relationships are reshaped.To be a parent, after all, is not a task for the faint-hearted.It involves raising, teaching, understanding, and eventually befriending a human being — one who can at times be stubborn, questioning, and who ultimately grows into a person of their own temperament.Parenting is a test most are never fully prepared for, a daily examination governed by an unending list of don’ts and dilemmas. This evolution is not a judgment on any generation of parents; most only want the best for their children, often even what they themselves could not achieve — not to burden them, but to build them for the world.Parenting, in essence, can be seen as a negotiation of fear, affection, aspiration, and trust. It is about guiding a human through the unknown while learning to let go, adapting as the child grows, and discovering that the rules of yesterday may no longer apply to the realities of today. The arc from strict discipline to dialogue, from unquestioned authority to mutual respect, reflects not just a change in homes, but a transformation in the very way we imagine childhood, the transition into adulthood, and the delicate dance in between.Parenting today has evolved significantly from the rigid, authority-driven approach of the past. Parents we spoke to shared nuanced views on balancing discipline, guidance, and modern realities, emphasizing the importance of empathy, communication, and trust.One mother explained how she navigates the realities of technology with her 15-year-old daughter: “While I remind her to study, I cannot ignore that phones have become a part of life. I try to balance this by not only allowing social media but also being tagged in reels my children share. What could be a distraction becomes a way to connect with them.”Another parent highlighted the risks of overly strict discipline: “If we are too firm, our children might trust outsiders before coming to us. We ought to be the first ones they share with.” Similarly, patience and empathy were emphasized by another parent: “We try to handle differences calmly. Anger often makes children fear rather than respect, but bad behaviour still needs to be called out.”Parents today increasingly favour guidance and understanding over rigid enforcement. One parent reflected on how the approach to parenting has shifted over generations:“Earlier, parents were strict, and children dealt with that strictness. Today, children prefer supportive guidance and warm communication. They enjoy interactive learning through activities. Children catch on quickly and need parental involvement. I focus on love, care, empathy, and independence when needed, balancing affection with healthy development.”Another parent raising three children, including a Class 10 student, shared how she balances guidance and independence:“We consciously try not to be as authoritative and strict as our parents were. Instead, we try to give our child a safe and comfortable space. Earlier, parenting focused on strictness and outcomes, while emotional support was often ignored. Today, communication matters more.”She added that while friendship in parenting is desirable, balance remains crucial:“Friendship is important, but it must be balanced with firmness. We listen and allow our children to share freely, but rules are also made clear. Boundaries help children feel supported while learning responsibility.”Reflecting on his own upbringing, one parent noted that fear-based discipline often leads to secrecy rather than responsibility. “My reaction to my son’s mistakes has always been a hug, followed by a calm discussion. If children see their parents as a safe space, they are more willing to confide.”Hari Shankar Soni, a media educator and father of two daughters, emphasized how parenting must adapt to modern realities: “I had my share of strict discipline from my father once. But, I have never raised hand on my children; I cannot imagine doing that with my kids. I don’t believe punishment works for this generation. I want to be a friend, not an authority they fear.”To understand parenting from the children’s point of view, we spoke to students across age groups. Their voices reveal how guidance, boundaries, and emotional support play out daily.Rubal, a Class 10 student in Delhi, shared: “My parents usually listen to my opinions, even if they don’t fully agree. They support me when I make mistakes. I wish they trusted me more on issues like career and mobile use, and understood that mistakes are part of growing up.”A Class 11 student echoed similar feelings: “My parents are supportive and provide solutions, but we differ on issues like marriage. They value security, while I think differently. I wish they understood my personality better.”A Class 6 student said: “My opinions are considered, and my parents explain things calmly. But sometimes I feel distant when they are strict about friends or social media.”A Class 9 student added: “I enjoy fun banter with my parents, but comparisons with others sometimes bother me. I try to voice it out.”Together, these voices suggest that children today seek understanding without absence, freedom without neglect, and boundaries without fear.Seema Kundra, a teacher with over 25 years of experience, says classrooms today reflect changing parenting styles, especially after Covid. “Many parents speak to teachers without filters, believing their authority is absolute. This attitude shows in children, who are far more casual with teachers.”She added that excessive screen time has widened the gap. “Parents sometimes criticise teachers in front of children, which undermines authority. Compared to five years ago, parental involvement has reduced.”Palak Sharma, a young educator, said the contrast is “worlds apart.” “Parents are present, but often transient due to work. Discipline and emotional support are pushed onto teachers.”While supporting gentle parenting, she cautioned against misinterpretation. “Gentle parenting has become an excuse to avoid discipline. Children need freedom, but also guidance and boundaries.”Whereas, Gauri Chandna Budhiraja, as a teacher noted that while parents are more engaged, “this sometimes crosses into over-protection and pressure.” Feedback that was once accepted, she said, is now often negotiated.Dr. Rajiv Mehta, Vice-Chairperson (Psychiatry) at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, stressed that the emotional climate at home plays a critical role.“Over-interference, hostility, and constant criticism create a damaging cycle. Parents pass anxiety to children, who then struggle emotionally.”He added: “Today’s helicopter parenting limits children’s independence. Earlier generations allowed more freedom to explore.”Psychologists commonly classify parenting into four styles, first outlined by Diana Baumrind and later expanded by Eleanor Maccoby and John Martin:• Authoritarian: High control, low warmth• Permissive: High warmth, low structure• Authoritative: Balanced boundaries and emotional support• Neglectful: Low responsiveness and guidanceWhat emerges today is a shift away from rigid authoritarianism. Most families attempt authoritative parenting, though many struggle to find balance amid technology, time scarcity, and rising anxiety.Parenting is never one-size-fits-all. Styles evolve with social realities, work pressures, culture, and mental health. Authority has softened into dialogue, fear into negotiation, and silence into openness. Yet closeness without boundaries can be as unsettling as discipline without empathy.Children today are more aware and expressive, but also face heightened emotional pressures. Parents, meanwhile, are caught between doing better than the generation before them — and fearing they may be doing too much, or too little.","Parenting is a test most are never fully prepared for, a daily examination governed by an unending list of don’ts and dilemmas.

Jailed Jammu & Kashmir MP Engineer Rashid gets interim bail to attend budget session in custody,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jailed-jammu-kashmir-mp-engineer-rashid-gets-interim-bail-to-attend-budget-session-in-custody/articleshow/127417467.cms,"ANI file photo

NEW DELHI/ SRINAGAR: A Delhi court granted Saturday interim bail to J&K independent MP Sheikh Abdul Rashid aka Engineer Rashid, allowing him to attend Parliament’s budget session from Jan 28 under armed escort.Held in Tihar jail since 2019, the 58-year-old MP faces charges under UAPA in a 2017 terrorist-funding case probed by NIA. He contested 2024 Lok Sabha polls from jail and stunned mainstream parties by defeating National Conference vice president Omar Abdullah by more than 200,000 votes from Baramulla in north Kashmir.Additional Sessions Judge Prashant Sharma permitted Rashid to attend sittings while remaining in custody, calling relief “limited in nature” and bound by strict conditions earlier imposed, including security arrangements and related expenses. Custody parole allows a prisoner to travel under police escort to a specific destination.Court had earlier granted similar permissions. Rashid attended the winter session last Nov under guard. He was also allowed custody parole between July 24 and Aug 4, 2025, for monsoon session sittings, and interim bail in 2024 to campaign in J&K assembly elections.Awami Itihaad Party, founded by Rashid in 2013 and listed by Election Commission as registered but unrecognised, welcomed the court order.Spokesperson Inam Un Nabi called it vital to ensure people of north Kashmir are not denied representation in Parliament.Nabi said travel expenses would depend on outcome of an appeal pending before high court. The party also renewed demand for Rashid’s release. Nabi said there was no justification to keep a two-time legislator and an elected MP behind bars, alleging victimisation for political beliefs. He cited former CJI DY Chandrachud’s recent remarks that even a few years of detention violate personal liberty.","Held in tihar jail since 2019, the 58-year-old mp faces charges under uapa in a 2017 terrorist-funding case probed by nia.

‘Govt-dictated transfer shows erosion of judiciary’s autonomy’

NEW DELHI: Stressing that the biggest threat to the independence of the judiciary ""is from within"", Supreme Court judge Ujjal Bhuyan expressed on Saturday his dissent and disappointment with the collegium's decision to transfer Justice Atul Sreedharan from MP high court to Allahabad HC on the Centre's suggestion, and said it ""reveals a striking intrusion of executive influence"" in collegium system, which is ""unfortunate"".Without naming Justice Sreedharan, Justice Bhuyan asked why should a judge be transferred from one high court to another merely because he had passed some ""inconvenient order"" against the govt.SC collegium had in Aug recommended Justice Sreedharan's transfer from MP to Chhattisgarh HC but the collegium changed its decision on Centre's request and shifted him to Allahabad HC in Oct. Many law experts termed it a punitive measure against him for passing orders inconvenient to the govt. It was a bench headed by him that had in May taken suo motu cognisance against BJP minister Vijay Shah for using 'scurrilous language' against Col Sofiya Qureshi.""Then again when it is noted in collegium resolution itself that a particular HC judge who was to be transferred to another HC was subsequently transferred to different HC by modifying earlier recommendation on reconsideration sought by central govt. Does it not compromise the integrity of the collegium system,"" he said.Justice Bhuyan was delivering the Principal G V Pandit Memorial Lecture on ""Constitutional Morality and Democratic Governance"" at ILS Law College in Pune.The collegium resolution which was uploaded on the SC website stirred a storm as it revealed officially for the first time that the govt interferes in appointment of judges. But that was soon withdrawn and it was replaced with a new release after omitting that part.Justice Bhuyan said that the govt has no role or say in the transfer of judges which comes within the exclusive domain of the judiciary and that a transfer done at the instance of the govt reveals that the independence of the judiciary has been compromised.""When collegium itself records that the transfer was done at the request of the central govt, it reveals a striking intrusion of executive influence to what is constitutionally supposed to be an independent process created to make such immune to executive and political influence… It reflects clear admission of political executive influencing collegium decision... It's unfortunate,"" Justice Bhuyan said.He said the govt cannot say that such and such judge be transferred to such and such HC or not to be transferred there. ""It has become more important for the judiciary, particularly members of collegium, to continue to function independently and the integrity of the collegium system must be maintained at all costs. As judges we have taken an oath of the Constitution to perform our duty without fear or favour. We must remain true to our oath. If we lose our credibility then nothing will remain of the judiciary. Judges will be there, court will be there, matter will also be adjudicated but heart and soul will evaporate,"" he said.He said that constitutional morality, which means that the country is governed by rule of law and not by rule of people, is the soul of democratic governance and it ensures that democratic institutions function keeping in mind the overarching principles of liberty, exercising restraint and adhering to constitutional values and not bulldozing through on the strength of numbers, authority and power.""Judiciary has neither the purse nor the sword. All that it has is the faith reposed in it by the people and if that faith is breached then nothing will be left of the judiciary,"" he said while holding the collegium is not the best available system for appointment of judges but there is a scope of reform.""Sociology says that a man is a political animal and a judge is also a human being. It is, therefore, natural for a judge to have political and ideological leaning and there is nothing wrong in it. But that should not cloud the decision-making process of a judge who is not supposed to follow political ideology but constitutional principle in judicial proceedings.

NEW DELHI: To honour junior commissioned officers (JCOs) with a record of long and distinguished military service, the Central govt has approved ahead of Republic Day the conferment of honorary commissioned ranks on 2,241 JCOs of the Indian Army.At least 437 JCOs have been elevated to the rank of honorary captain, while 1,804 JCOs have been conferred the rank of honorary lieutenant, recognising their decades of selfless military service, according to an official notification.Among those elevated to the rank of honorary captain is Subedar Major and honorary Lieutenant Sanjay Kumar, a Param Vir Chakra recipient, whose name resonates far beyond military circles. Kumar is a legendary Army officer (13 JAK Rifles) who was awarded India’s highest gallantry honour for his heroics in the 1999 Kargil War. On July 4, 1999, he single-handedly captured Flat Top, Point 4875, by neutralising enemy machine-gun posts despite severe injuries.Honorary ranks in the Indian Army are conferred on JCOs with impeccable service records who have displayed professional excellence and sterling leadership qualities at unit level.While these ranks — honorary lieutenant and honorary captain— do not alter command structures, they carry deep symbolic value within the armed forces. The number of those conferred the honour this year highlights the oft-neglected contributions of Subedars and Subedar Majors, who form the bedrock of the Army’s functioning. They train young soldiers, preserve regimental traditions, enforce discipline and provide continuity in some of the most challenging operational environments in the world.In addition to the honour and protocol status, these ranks can result in a modest enhancement in pensionary benefits, depending on the applicable rules, an aspect that assumes importance for personnel retiring earlier than most govt employees. The honorary ranks are a formal acknowledgement by the nation that exceptional service rendered within a shorter career deserves to be recognised and respected.","The central govt has approved ahead of republic day the conferment of honorary commissioned ranks on 2,241 jcos of the indian army.

He served as minister of state in Omar’s cabinet, handling significant portfolios like tourism and home. However, he lost his seat in the 2014 election to Altaf Bukhari of the PDP. Wani suffered another defeat in 2024, losing the Kupwara seat to PDP’s Fayaz Ahmad Mir. Despite the electoral setbacks, he has remained influential in Omar’s govt.","J&k lt governor manoj sinha saturday evening accorded nasir aslam wani, adviser of cm omar abdullah, rank and privileges of a cabinet minister.

With sustained effort and hard work, they can achieve their goals within the next one or two years.""Highlighting success stories from the constituency, the Chief Minister cited Bijumoni Devi, a member of the Samannay Self-Help Group under Barbhag Development Block, who has become self-reliant through her pickle-making enterprise and now earns around Rs 15,000 per month, amounting to an annual income of Rs 1.80 lakh.Similarly, Anita Thakuriya, a member of the Jeevanjyoti Self-Help Group of Norowagaon, has achieved an annual income of Rs 2.23 lakh through animal husbandry and fish farming.Dr. Sarma added, ""Out of 40 lakh women associated with Self-Help Groups in Assam, more than eight lakh have already become Lakhpati Baideu.

"ICMR hands over Mobile Stroke Units to Assam, cuts treatment time to 2 hours",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/icmr-hands-over-mobile-stroke-units-to-assam-cuts-treatment-time-to-2-hours/articleshow/127411660.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Wednesday handed over two Mobile Stroke Units (MSUs) to the Government of Assam, marking a major shift in stroke care—from patients travelling long distances to hospitals, to hospitals reaching patients in remote areas.Stroke is among the leading causes of death and long-term disability in India. In an acute stroke, nearly 1.9 billion brain cells are lost every minute if treatment is delayed, making access within the golden hour critical. However, reaching a stroke-ready hospital remains a challenge in rural and difficult terrains.Handing over the units, Rajiv Bahl, Secretary, Department of Health Research and Director General, ICMR, said Mobile Stroke Units—first developed in Germany—have now been successfully evaluated in rural and remote parts of Northeast India. “India is the second country globally to report successful integration of an MSU with emergency medical services for treating acute ischemic stroke patients in rural settings,” he said.The initiative, developed under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and guided by Union Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda, aims to ensure advanced healthcare reaches the poorest and most marginalised populations, even in the most challenging geographies.Sharing the state’s experience, P Ashok Babu, Secretary and Commissioner, Health and Family Welfare, Government of Assam, said the handover strengthens the state’s emergency response system and ensures continuity of the life-saving service under state ownership.The MSU functions as a hospital on wheels, equipped with a CT scanner, teleconsultation with specialists, point-of-care diagnostics and clot-busting drugs, enabling diagnosis and treatment at or near the patient’s home.The impact has already been evident. During the pilot and evaluation phase, the model reduced treatment time from nearly 24 hours to about two hours, cut stroke-related deaths by one-third, and reduced long-term disability by eight times. Between 2021 and August 2024, the MSUs handled over 2,300 emergency calls, with 90% of patients treated directly from their homes after integration with the 108 ambulance service.","Stroke is among the leading causes of death and long-term disability in india.
