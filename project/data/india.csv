NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah , during his visit to the Northeast, gifted a guitar to seven-year-old Mizoram singing prodigy Esther Lalduhawmi Hnamte after she performed a heartfelt rendition of Vande Mataram in Aizawl on Saturday.Moved by her performance, Shah took to social media platform X to express his admiration. ""Love for Bharat unites us all. Deeply moved to listen to Mizoram's wonder kid Esther Lalduhawmi Hnamte, singing Vande Mataram in Aizawl today.

SC sets free over a dozen convicted for murders by trial courts and HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/over-a-dozen-convicted-by-trial-courts-and-hcs-set-free-by-supreme-court-in-a-year/articleshow/119063163.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: In the last one year, the Supreme Court has acquitted more than a dozen persons, who were convicted concurrently by the trial courts and the High Courts and sentenced to death or life imprisonment, in cases that included rape-cum-murder of a 10-year-old girl and manslaughters.Despite repeated SC rulings that concurrent decisions of the trial courts and HCs are not to be interfered with unless found to be ‘perverse’, the SC in majority of these dozen cases in short 8-10 page judgments punched holes in prosecution evidence, which were cogent in the eyes of the trial courts and the HCs, to conclude that guilt of the convicts are not proved beyond reasonable doubt.In each of these cases, acquittal by SC came after more than a decade of the incident. The HCs and the SC took a long time to decide the appeals of the convicts even though the trial courts had recorded convictions cases within a year or two. In most cases the convicts, prior to their acquittal, had spent years behind bars. In one case, the convict had spent 13 years, virtually a life sentence.If they were innocent, or not found guilty, who would give them back their prime years? Can they be compensated monetarily as after being convicted by the trial courts and the HCs, they would not be accepted in any job. There is no provision in the criminal law that mandates the government to compensate a person who was innocent yet lodged to jail? Should the constitutional courts, where the appeals remained pending for years, be saddled with costs for delayed justice?A more important question arises as heinous crimes involving manslaughter or rape-cum-murder go unpunished. What message would the SC, which has repeatedly advised the courts to be alive to the ‘cry for justice’ of the society, send to the murdered person's parents and relatives, who had felt justice had prevailed with the concurrent convictions by the courts below?Take for example the case of a 10-year-old girl, who to quench her thirst in the searing heat of May while grazing her goats, goes to a tubewell and was raped and murdered by the tubewell operator (Ashok Vs Uttar Pradesh; judgment on Dec 2, 2024). He was convicted and sentenced to death by the trial court. The Allahabad HC confirmed the conviction but reduced the sentence to imprisonment till death.But a bench headed by Justice A S Oka, who in fact is the author of most of the dozen instances of acquittal last year in heinous crimes, found that the accused was not given a legal aid counsel during the trial to enable him defend himself properly, thus prejudicing him during the trial.“After 15 years of the incident, it would be unjust if the appellant is now told to explain the circumstances and material specifically appearing against him in the evidence,” the bench had said in a 37-page judgment, 20 of which were devoted to towards mandatory obligation of trial courts as well as prosecution to provide accused persons with legal aid if they are unable to engage an advocate.Another important question, that emerges from reversal of concurrent judgments by the SC, is whether the sessions court judges, who are senior judicial officers, and the HC judges not trained enough to shift the chaff from the grain while scrutinising evidence in sensitive criminal cases?Justice Oka led bench seems to adopt the maxim ‘it is better that 100 guilty persons should escape, than that one innocent person should suffer’. In the criminal justice system of India, police are not obliged to resume investigations into murder cases if the convict gets acquitted by the highest court. For years, they take satisfaction that the evidence collected by them resulted in conviction in trial court and confirmed by the HC. But, in the dozen cases of acquittal, the murders would remain a mystery.","Supreme court has acquitted more than a dozen persons, who were convicted concurrently by the trial courts and the high courts.

A case was registered on March 10, and two women running the YouTube channel were arrested on March 12. Police later accused the women of shooting the video inside BRS office.""They (BRS) brought paid artists to their party office, recorded it and posted it on social media.

SILIGURI: A real-life ""Jurassic Park"" is taking shape in the cloud-draped Eastern Himalayas - not to resurrect dinosaurs, but a last stand for species on the brink. Here, among red pandas and snow leopards, science is not cloning the past, but saving what remains of the present.Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park in Darjeeling is India's first ""frozen zoo"" - a genetic ark preserving the DNA of Himalayan wildlife in steel tanks filled with liquid nitrogen at temperatures plunging to -196°C.A collaboration between the zoo and Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, the cryogenic conservation initiative aims to ensure that even if these species dwindle in the wild, their genetic blueprints remain intact. ""This is an effort to preserve DNA samples,"" said Debal Roy, Bengal's chief wildlife warden.Bengal's chief wildlife warden Debal Roy said, ""We will collect tissue samples from wild animals. If an animal dies naturally or due to unnatural causes such as road kill, we have decided to take their tissue samples and preserve them in this facility.""Spread across 67.8 acres at an altitude of 2,150 metres (7,050ft), the zoo is India's highest-altitude zoological park and a leader in conservation breeding programmes for red pandas, snow leopards, and Tibetan wolves. It has also undertaken conservation work for species like the Markhor (screw-horned goat), Mishmi takin, and Himalayan black bear.Unlike traditional zoos, where animals are showcased for visitors, this facility has a dual role - housing live animals while also banking their genetic legacy. Frozen zoos are gaining traction globally, offering a last line of defence against extinction.In Darjeeling, bio-banking efforts began in July last year, with scientists collecting and preserving genetic material from captive animals such as red pandas, Himalayan black bears, snow leopards, and gorals.""As of now, we have started with captive animals,"" zoo director Basavaraj Holeyachi said. ""We have developed a dedicated lab inside the zoo where we preserve gametes and DNA of endangered species .""The process involves two levels of preservation: genetic sampling, which requires storage at -20°C and bio-banking, where tissues must be submerged in liquid nitrogen at -196°C. Scientists prepare the samples to prevent cell damage.""The frozen zoo contains irreplaceable genetic material - living cell lines, gametes, and embryos - that are vital for conservation efforts, assisted reproduction, and evolutionary biology,"" Holeyachi said.In the future, stored genetic material could be used for assisted reproduction techniques, including the possibility of using surrogate mothers to revive species. ""As long as there is a continuous supply of liquid nitrogen, these tissues can be stored indefinitely,"" said an official. The facility's efforts have drawn international recognition, with World Association of Zoos and Aquariums recently shortlisting it for its red panda conservation initiatives.As habitats shrink and climate change alters ecosystems, the frozen zoo may hold the key to ensuring that the ghostly silhouettes of snow leopards and the playful rustlings of red pandas continue to be more than just echoes of the past.","Frozen zoos are gaining traction across the globe, offering a last line of defence against extinction.

BENGALURU: With the gold smuggling racket involving Kannada actor Ranya Rao getting murkier by the day as three central investigation agencies keep digging deeper, Karnataka government on Saturday ordered DGP (Karnataka Police Housing Corporation) Ramachandra Rao, her father, to go on 'compulsory leave'.Ranya was reportedly being escorted by a police constable deployed for protocol services extended to IPS officers when she was intercepted by DRI sleuths at Bengaluru airport while trying to smuggle in 14.2 kg gold from Dubai on March 3. The constable, during questioning, revealed he had standing instructions to receive Ranya whenever she returned from her foreign trips, and that he had no idea of gold being smuggled in.Sources said state govt directed DGP (Karnataka Police Housing Corporation) Ramachandra Rao to go on leave in a bid to avoid any possible embarrassment, with CBI and ED now on the case of gold smuggling racket involving Kannada actor Ranya Rao, citing national security concerns.

Waving placards that read, ‘No Need for Moon Mission, Isro — Just Drive Here!', frustrated residents chanted ""Beku beku, road beku."" That Shivakumar did not turn up only left them angry and frustrated.""This road has been in a terrible condition for the last six months,"" said Kusum Sahay , an elderly resident, adding, ""There are no pavements for pedestrians, and stepping out of a car itself is a challenge.""Venkat, another resident, fumed over the neglect of one of the city's key localities. ""We are the creme de la creme of Bengaluru, yet infrastructure here is cringe-worthy. This is a major road connecting Koramangala and Indiranagar — how hard is it to fix it quickly?""A resident of Mantri Espana highlighted the daily struggle. ""We moved here two years ago hoping things would improve, but nothing has changed. Just yesterday (Tuesday), I took my father to an eye hospital — a seven-minute drive took 20 minutes because of these crater-sized potholes. For elderly people, walking to Sakra Hospital is impossible. We are forced to take cars even for short distances, and that just adds to the traffic chaos.""Kanchana Ganeshan, another protester, recalled how she used to cycle on the lake road four years ago. ""Now, I wouldn't dare. What used to be a smooth ride turned into a bone-rattling nightmare.

PATNA: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tej Pratap Yadav celebrated Holi with party workers at his official residence in Patna on Saturday. A video from the event has gone viral on social media, showing Tej Pratap Yadav instructing a policeman to dance during the celebrations.In the video, Tej Pratap Yadav, seated on a stage, can be heard telling the uniformed officer, ""(Will play a song and you will have to dance, if you don’t dance, you will be suspended)."" He further adds, ""Bura mat maano Holi hai,"" before starting to sing a Holi song.The incident took place at Yadav's residence in Patna. Tej Pratap Yadav is the elder son of Lalu Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi.The video has led to criticism from political opponents. BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla commented, ""Like father, like son. First, the father (Lalu Yadav)- as the then CM used to make law dance to his tunes and turn Bihar into a jungle raj. Now, the son, despite being out of power, attempts to make laws and protectors of law dance to his tunes through threats and pressure. He threatens Police personnel with suspension if he doesn't dance. This shows that RJD believes in jungle raj. If they come to power even by mistake, they would violate law and make protectors of law dance. This is a trailer. So, it is important to keep them away from power.""JD(U) national spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan Prasad also reacted to the video. He said, ""'Jungleraaj' has ended but Yuvraj of Lalu Yadav is threatening a policeman about the consequences if he (the policeman) will not comply with what he is instructing (to dance). Bihar has now changed. Be it Tejashwi Yadav, Tej Pratap Yadav or any of the family members of Lalu Yadav - they need to understand that such acts have no place in the environment of this changing Bihar.""BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain also criticized Tej Pratap saying, ""He asked his bodyguard to dance; otherwise, he would suspend him. He has no power and authority to suspend anyone. This is Nitish Kumar's '', not Jungle Raj. Using such a language is unfortunate. RJD leaders have not evolved.""Not just the opposition but ally Congress also condemned Tej Pratap's actions. Congress leader Rashid Alvi said, ""I condemn what he said. He is unaware that he does not have the power to suspend a person.

Accused denies drunk driving, claims innocence

Legal proceedings and further investigation

NEW DELHI: Rakshit Ravish Chaurasia , the 23-year-old prime accused in the fatal Vadodara car crash that claimed the life of a woman and left eight others injured, was brought back to the accident site for a crime scene recreation. In a video shared by ANI, Chaurasia appeared visibly uncomfortable, limping and clutching his ears as he was escorted by the police.The dramatic scene unfolded as investigators attempted to piece together the events of the early hours of March 14, when a speeding car driven by Chaurasia allegedly rammed into a two-wheeler. The impact proved fatal for one woman, while several others sustained serious injuries.Vadodara Police Commissioner Narasimha Komar disclosed new details, stating that more than three vehicles were linked to the incident, including two active vehicles and one electric vehicle (EV). While Chaurasia is currently in custody, police are scrutinizing all angles, including possible intoxication at the time of the crash.“We have registered a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, apart from invoking sections under the Motor Vehicle Acts. Our forensic teams are compiling physical and material evidence,"" the police said in a statement.Chaurasia, however, has refuted allegations of drunk driving. He claimed that he had attended a Holika Dahan celebration but did not consume alcohol or attend any post-event parties. According to him, he was driving at a speed of 50 km/h at the time of the crash.“I was not drunk. I went to the Holika Dahan event but did not drink or party. I want to meet the victim’s family and take responsibility for the accident,” Chaurasia reportedly told police.Authorities, however, are not taking his statement at face value. “Blood samples have been collected from Chaurasia and his co-passenger Pranshu Chauhan to determine whether alcohol or other intoxicants were involved. The investigation will proceed based on forensic findings,” Commissioner Komar said.Police continue to track the movements of the accused’s co-passenger and are in the process of recovering crucial digital and physical evidence from the scene. The forensic report will play a key role in determining whether Chaurasia was indeed sober at the time of the accident.With mounting evidence and a growing legal case, the Vadodara hit-and-run is quickly turning into a high-profile investigation. The next steps will depend on forensic reports and the police’s final charge sheet.","Rakshit ravish chaurasia, 23, is the prime accused in the fatal vadodara car crash that claimed the life of a woman and left eight others injured.

DMK's response

What's the issue?



NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing debate between the Union government and Tamil Nadu over language policy, Andhra Pradesh deputy chief minister and Janasena Party chief Pawan Kalyan said on Saturday that claims of Hindi being imposed are misleading.""Either imposing a language forcibly or opposing a language blindly; both doesn’t help to achieve the objective of National & Cultural integration of our Bharat. I had never opposed Hindi as a language. I only opposed making it compulsory. When the NEP 2020 itself does not enforce Hindi, spreading false narratives about its imposition is nothing but an attempt to mislead the public,"" Kalyan said.He pointed out that under the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, students can choose to study any two Indian languages along with a foreign language. ""If they do not wish to study Hindi, they can and also opt for Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, Marathi, Sanskrit, Gujarati, Assamese, Kashmiri, Odia, Bengali, Punjabi, Sindhi, Bodo, Dogri, Konkani, Maithili, Meitei, Nepali, Santali, Urdu, or any other Indian language,"" he said.Kalyan’s statement comes in response to Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin , who has accused the Union government of imposing Hindi and has refused to implement the three-language formula under NEP.Earlier, on Friday also Kalyan had criticized Tamil Nadu leaders, questioning why they allow Tamil films to be dubbed in Hindi for financial gain while opposing the language. Speaking at his party’s foundation day event in Kakinada district, he said, ""In Tamil Nadu, people oppose the imposition of Hindi. This makes me wonder if they don't want Hindi, then why do they dub Tamil films in Hindi for financial gains? They want money from Bollywood but refuse to accept Hindi. What kind of logic is that?""He also highlighted the importance of multiple languages for national unity. ""India needs multiple languages, including Tamil, not just two. We must embrace linguistic diversity—not only to maintain the integrity of our nation but also to foster love and unity among its people,"" he added.DMK leader TKS Elangovan responded to Kalyan's statement by saying that Tamil Nadu has always followed a two-language policy, with Tamil and English being taught in schools. ""We have been opposing Hindi since 1938. We passed legislation in the state assembly that Tamil Nadu will always follow the two-language formula because of the advice and suggestions of the experts in education, not actors. The bill was passed way back in 1968 when Pawan Kalyan was not even born. He doesn't know the politics of Tamil Nadu,"" Elangovan said.Actor Prakash Raj also commented, saying, ""Saying 'don't impose your Hindi on us' is not the same as hating another language. It is about protecting our mother tongue and our cultural identity with pride.""Tamil Nadu chief minister Stalin, speaking at a rally in Thiruvallur on March 12, criticized the NEP, saying it was not aimed at education but at promoting Hindi. ""National Education Policy is not education policy; it is saffron policy. The policy is not created to develop India but to develop Hindi. We are opposing the policy as it would destroy the Tamil Nadu education system completely,"" Stalin had said.The debate over the National Education Policy (NEP) centers around its three-language formula, which Tamil Nadu fears could lead to the imposition of Hindi in the state. Chief Minister MK Stalin has argued that the policy prioritizes Hindi over regional languages, affecting the state’s linguistic diversity and autonomy.The central government, however, maintains that the NEP promotes multilingualism and offers flexibility in language education. Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has denied claims of Hindi imposition, stating that states have the freedom to choose their preferred languages under the policy.The dispute intensified after the Centre withheld Rs 2,152 crore allocated for Tamil Nadu’s Samagra Shiksha scheme, citing the state’s refusal to implement the NEP.Tamil Nadu has historically opposed the three-language formula, viewing it as a step toward enforcing Hindi, while the central government argues that the policy helps students access employment opportunities across different regions.","Andhra pradesh deputy chief minister and janasena party chief pawan kalyan said on saturday that claims of hindi being imposed are misleading.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) on Friday informed a special court that the Karnataka police protocol ffficer was involved in a gold smuggling racket linked to actress Ranya Rao. Opposing her bail plea, the central agency told the Special Court for Economic Offences that Rao had traveled to Dubai 27 times since January this year.Ranya is the stepdaughter of K Ramachandra Rao, a DGP-rank officer serving as the managing director of Karnataka state police housing and infrastructure development corporation.The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) is India's top anti-smuggling agency operating under the Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs, which falls under the ministry of finance. Its role includes identifying and preventing smuggling activities involving contraband, drug trafficking, illegal trade in wildlife and environmentally sensitive goods, as well as tackling commercial fraud and Customs duty evasion in international trade.The court denied bail to Ranya on Friday after hearing DRI’s arguments. The agency said that investigations had uncovered a methodical approach to smuggling gold. ""The investigation till date has unearthed the sophisticated methodology used in smuggling the gold, usage of State Police Protocol Officer to bypass security, Hawala Transaction to transfer the funds from India to Dubai to purchase gold, involvement of larger syndicate,"" the DRI said.Judge Vishwanath C Gowdar, who presided over the case, took these claims into account while passing the order.""In the case on hand, the accused No 1 (Ranya) possessing Resident Identity Card of UAE and having history of traveled to Dubai on 27 occasions since January 2025, is another factor which does not incline the court to extend discretionary relief of granting bail to accused,"" the court said.Ranya was arrested on March 3 at Kempegowda International Airport after gold bars worth Rs 12.56 crore were found in her possession. Following this, authorities searched her residence and recovered gold jewelry worth Rs 2.06 crore and Rs 2.67 crore in cash.The DRI further informed the court that the investigation was ongoing to establish international connections. It also mentioned that Ranya had not cooperated during custody.""It is also specifically contended that the alleged offence is cognizable, non-bailable, and punishable with imprisonment up to seven years,"" the court observed.The agency said the offence had serious implications for the country’s economy and security.According to the court, ""The remand applications placed on record at this stage of proceedings, disclose the conspiracy hatched by the accused No1 (Ranya) by colluding with State Police Protocol Officer.""It also noted, ""The arguments of the complainant Agency as to the usage of Hawala transaction for transfer of money from India to Dubai and also the International links being forthcoming as per the preliminary investigation is also a factor which inclines this court to hold the accused.""The judge said that Ranya had the capacity to manipulate evidence and witnesses, which could affect the trial.""The apprehension of the complainant as to the accused No.1 will throttle the witnesses and flee away from the process of court cannot be ruled out at this juncture,"" the court observed.The court noted that the allegations against her were evident at this stage, and her method of concealing gold in the form of bars while traveling showed her intent.Apart from DRI, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) are also looking into the case.Meanwhile, on March 10, the Karnataka government appointed additional chief secretary Gaurav Gupta to investigate the role, if any, of Ramachandra Rao in the smuggling case involving his stepdaughter.","The directorate of revenue intelligence (dri) is india's top anti-smuggling agency. The court denied bail to ranya on friday after hearing dri’s arguments.

Decoding the statement

Left-Congress dilemma

A calculated electoral strategy?

Himanta Biswa Sarma playbook

Road Ahead for non-BJP parties

NEW DELHI: ""We will follow what Kejriwal did in Delhi."" No, Suvendu Adhikari , Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the West Bengal Assembly, wasn't referring to model schools or mohalla clinics. Instead, the former TMC strongman was drawing parallels to the unceremonious expulsion of Vijender Gupta from the Delhi Assembly when AAP enjoyed a supermajority, juxtaposing it with Gupta's recent elevation as Speaker. Suvendu's assertion was that once the BJP assumes power in Bengal next year, Muslim TMC MLAs who manage to win will be picked up and thrown out of the Assembly—just as Gupta had been removed.A dynast politician best known for defeating Mamata Banerjee in the 2021 Assembly elections from his home turf of Nandigram, Suvendu has steadily escalated his anti-Muslim rhetoric since his induction into the BJP. However, even by his standards, this latest remark has sent shockwaves across Bengal’s political landscape, drawing sharp rebukes from opposition ranks, including the Chief Minister herself. Speaking from the Assembly, Mamata Banerjee vowed to protect the interests of all communities and warned Suvendu against ""playing with fire."" Meanwhile, a mid-level Congress leader, former MLA Viktor, has filed an FIR against the LoP. The crucial question, however, is why Suvendu is adopting such an incendiary tone when the state elections are still more than a year away.To many observers, Suvendu's latest outburst is a desperate attempt to keep his flock intact amid swirling rumours that nearly eight BJP MLAs are on the verge of defecting. In 2021, the BJP had surged from three to a record 77 seats, largely on the back of an en masse shift in votes from the Left and Congress. This catapulted the party to the position of principal opposition, with Suvendu playing a pivotal role in the turnaround. Expectedly, he was rewarded with the LoP post, making him the most visible face of Bengal BJP, gradually overshadowing veterans like Dilip Ghosh and Sukanta Majumdar. However, subsequent electoral outcomes have not favoured the BJP. It's number in the Assembly has steadily dwindled, with unofficial count of around 65. The party’s Lok Sabha tally in Bengal shrank from 18 to 12. Subsequently, it failed to capitalise on public anger over the RG Kar incident, where urban pockets of the state erupted in protests over the rape and murder of a young doctor. In by-elections held after the protests, BJP won nothing even losing seat it had previously held. The defection of Haldia MLA Tapasi Mondal further weakened Suvendu’s grip—especially since Haldia, a crucial port town in his home district of Purba Medinipur, has long been considered his pocket borough. A mutiny in his backyard signalled to TMC that even Purba Midnapore could be in play in 2026. Against this backdrop, Suvendu’s aggressive rhetoric serves as a strategic ploy to shift focus from BJP’s precarious position to the more convenient narrative of Hindu-Muslim polarisation, ensuring that former Left and Congress voters who had switched to the BJP do not reconsider their allegiance.For the Left, which ruled Bengal for over three decades, the crisis is existential. Its vote share plummeted from 26% in 2016 to just over 5% in 2021. The party’s performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections remained lacklustre, mirroring Congress’s struggles. Both parties have failed to grasp Bengal’s evolving political climate, where welfare politics and religious identity now determine electoral fortunes—a stark departure from the days when ironclad ideology alone dictated voting patterns. The Left’s lack of prominent mass leaders hastened its decline, while its alliance with Congress has yielded minimal electoral dividends due to limited vote transfer capabilities. Yet, the RG Kar protests backed by Left supported forces briefly rekindled interest about them among Bengal’s intelligentsia. Whether this translates into electoral gains remains uncertain, but Suvendu’s renewed pitch threatens to derail any organisational resurgence the Left may have hoped for. Unsurprisingly, the Left has maintained a guarded stance on the issue, criticising both TMC and BJP. Its votes are scattered across the state—insufficient to win seats outright but enough to play spoiler in a really close contest. That leverage is precisely what Suvendu seeks to neutralise.Congress’s situation is slightly different. Its vote base is primarily concentrated in three North Bengal districts—Malda, Murshidabad, and North Dinajpur—where it competes with the TMC for Muslim votes, particularly in Malda and Murshidabad. Unsurprisingly, the party has taken a more combative stance than the Left, registering vociferous protests, filing FIR, and vowing to safeguard Muslim interests. However, political analysts argue that with the deepening of religious fault lines, these tactics may not suffice.Political commentator Sibaji Pratim Basu believes Suvendu’s statements are not impulsive but part of a calculated strategy. Bengal’s Muslim population stands at around 31%, with the majority voting for TMC. Mamata Banerjee understands that even securing 25-30% of the Hindu vote ensures a decisive victory under the first-past-the-post system. With extensive welfare schemes targeting women, TMC starts from an advantageous position. Suvendu’s objective is to fracture this vote bank, attempting to consolidate Hindu votes in BJP’s favour. However, Professor Basu dismisses this as a pipe dream. He also believes that as long as Narendra Modi remains Prime Minister and the BJP holds national power, Bengal’s Muslim voters are unlikely to abandon Mamata Banerjee. He suggests that only a shift in Delhi’s political landscape could trigger a realignment of Muslim votes in Bengal—but until then, the TMC has little to worry about.Suvendu likely understands this reality, which explains why he has all but abandoned efforts to woo Muslim voters. Instead, he is emulating the playbook of Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. In Assam, where Muslims form a significant demographic, Himanta has aggressively consolidated Hindu votes by raising voice against 'Miya Muslims'—who originally hailed from present day Bangladesh—questioning their presence in Upper Assam and portraying them as a demographic threat to indigenous Assamese communities. From the Assembly, Himanta made it clear that he would not allow 'Miya Muslims' to dominate Assam’s political discourse. Suvendu appears to be taking a similar approach in Bengal.Mamata Banerjee, while condemning Suvendu’s remarks, also took the opportunity to attack his shifting political allegiances, remarking that he would readily switch sides again if offered the right deal. The West Bengal CM denounced Suvendu’s comments as unbecoming of a leader of his stature, accusing him of deliberately making polarising statements during Ramzan to provoke Muslim sentiments. Interestingly, Mamata also claimed she had instructed Minister and Kolkata Mayor Firhad Hakim and others to refrain from making religious comments tacitly acknowledging that opposition allegations of appeasement politics—though largely exaggerated—were not entirely baseless. She cleverly roped PM Modi into the debate, questioning why Suvendu takes issue with Muslim communities in Bengal but remains silent when Modi praises Arab nations during his foreign visits. Invoking the teachings of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda , Mamata accused Suvendu of promoting a version of Hinduism incompatible with the scriptures and seers. While Mamata exercised restraint, one of her party MLA, Humayun Kabir, has already threatened Suvendu Adhikari of dire consequences if he doesn't withdraw his statement. BJP leader though wasted no time to reject Humayun's demand.Mamata’s balancing act is evident—she seeks to reassure her Muslim base without alienating Hindu voters. Even on the Bangladesh issue, she has taken a proactive stance, preempting BJP’s attempts to polarise voters, by repeatedly questioning what the Modi government is doing to protect Hindu interests there. Mamata Banerjee has also warmed up to ISF, a party predominantly catering to Muslim constituents. This is to counter AIMIM, which has already announced that it will contest in all seats in Bengal. It believes the state has close to 40% Muslim votes and deserves a party like AIMIM.The INDIA alliance remains in limbo and TMC has already announced it will contest the Assembly election alone, like the Lok Sabha polls. While the Congress and Left may or may not ally, their challenge remains formidable, they must first establish themselves as a credible opposition force.For now, Suvendu Adhikari has ensured that the political discourse in Bengal remains firmly centered on polarization, a calculated gamble. With Mamata Banerjee adeptly navigating the tightrope between reassuring Muslim voters and addressing Hindu concerns, the BJP has its work cut out. But at least it doesn't need to worry too much about significantly sharing the opposition space with Left-Congress.","Suvendu adhikari's 'muslim mlas to be thrown out' claim: why the left-congress may be the real loser.

He claimed that the incident occurred after the airbags in his car deployed suddenly, hampering his vision.Chaurasia said he wants to meet the family of the victims and will respect whatever they want to happen.“We were going ahead of the scooty, we were turning right and there was a pothole on the road. There was a scooty and a car while we were turning right... The car slightly touched the other vehicle and the airbag opened suddenly, our vision was hampered and the car went out of control. We were going at 50 km/hour,” Chaurasia said.“There were no people at that time, just a scooter and a car. I had no idea. I did not do any party, I went for Holika Dahan and was not drunk... Today, I was told that one woman has died and a few have sustained injuries. I want to meet the family of the victims, it is my fault and whatever they want that should happen,” he added.This comes a day after a speeding car driven by a 20-year-old law student crashed into two-wheelers in Vadodara city in the early hours of Friday.The accident occurred around 12:30 a.m. near Muktanand Cross Roads in the Karelibaug area. Following the crash, the driver, Chaurasia, was arrested, said Deputy Commissioner of Police Panna Momaya.Near Amrapali Complex, Chaurasia first hit a woman on a two-wheeler before knocking down two other bikers. The impact was so severe that the car’s airbags deployed.When the vehicle finally came to a halt, Chauhan, who had been with Chaurasia, stepped out and walked away, repeatedly saying, ""I didn’t do anything. He was driving the car,"" while pointing at Chaurasia. Chaurasia, a fourth-year law student at M.S. University, then stepped out of the car and began shouting ""another round,"" ""uncle,"" and ""Om Namah Shivay"" at the top of his voice.Passersby chased him down, preventing his escape. Some angry locals thrashed him before the police arrived.CCTV footage captured the entire incident. The injured, including a child, have been hospitalized.

Lalu's 'kurta faad' Holi



Election bugle for Bihar



NEW DELHI:. A redemption of Lalu Yadav-style Holi celebration snowballed into a controversy after RJD leader and former chief minister's elder son Tej Pratap Yadav ordered a police constable to shake legs to avert his suspension.While Bharatiya Janata Party latched on to the former minister's ""prank"" to remind everyone of the ""Jungle Raj"" era, the act could be seen as RJD's desperate attempt to woo back its rural and backward caste vote banks ahead of the assembly elections scheduled at the end of the year.Similar to this year's Holi celebrations, RJD supremo used to organise grand Holi gatherings where Bihar's who's who used to line up to let their kurtas be torn into pieces.Slogan-shouting crowds and the procession of MLAs and MPs trooping in with drums and trumpets used to greet the uncrowned raja of Bihar.Lalu Yadav’s Holi celebrations were a spectacle of Bihar's rural life, which connected directly with the core of his voter base—mainly the Dalits, OBCs, and marginalized communities. His celebrations often included vibrant processions with drum beats, slogans, and an atmosphere of joyous abandon.This was symbolic of rural pride, and Lalu presented himself as a champion of the common man, particularly from the backward and poorer sections of society.Additionally, the state will also be diving into full-fledged election mode after Holi. Earlier during the celebration, Tej Pratap also proclaimed that Bihar has decided that Tejashwi would become chief minister after the upcoming elections.""It has been decided that Tejashwi will be the chief minister this time, on the occasion of this Holi,"" Tej Pratap had said.The political temperature of the state is already on the rise after Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar lost his cool several times in the assembly of the opposition leaders.Leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav strongly objected to the language used by Nitish Kumar for his parents and once again raised questions over Bihar chief minister's health.Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party attacked Lalu's family after Tej Pratap's video surfaced. BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla commented, ""Like father, like son. First, the father (Lalu Yadav) - as the then CM used to make law dance to his tunes and turn Bihar into a jungle raj. Now, the son, despite being out of power, attempts to make laws and protectors of law dance to his tunes through threats and pressure.""""He threatens Police personnel with suspension if he doesn't dance. This shows that RJD believes in jungle raj. If they come to power even by mistake, they would violate law and make protectors of law dance. This is a trailer. So, it is important to keep them away from power,"" he added.JD(U) national spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan Prasad also reacted to the video and said that such acts have no place in the environment of this changing Bihar.""'Jungle raj' has ended but Yuvraj of Lalu Yadav is threatening a policeman about the consequences if he (the policeman) will not comply with what he is instructing (to dance),"" Rajeev Ranjan Prasad said.""Bihar has now changed. Be it Tejashwi Yadav, Tej Pratap Yadav, or any of the family members of Lalu Yadav - they need to understand that such acts have no place in the environment of this changing Bihar,"" he added.",Tej pratap yadav ordered a police constable to shake legs to avert his suspension.
