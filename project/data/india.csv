Experts warn: Mass removal of stray dogs could backfire on public health,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/experts-warn-mass-removal-of-stray-dogs-could-backfire-on-public-health/articleshow/126556050.cms,"Image: IANS

Free-living dogs form stable social groups when food sources, sterilisation, and vaccination coverage remain consistent.

Large-scale removal disrupts these systems, creating territorial vacuums that are rapidly filled by other dogs -- often unvaccinated and unsterilised -- an effect associated with increased dog-bite incidents and heightened disease risk.

Mass removal undermines rabies control by dismantling herd immunity. India’s existing Catch-Neuter-Vaccinate-Release (CNVR) framework, when implemented consistently, targets the internationally recognised threshold of vaccinating at least 70% of dogs in a given area.

Data show steep declines in human rabies deaths and dog-bite incidence in areas with sustained sterilisation and vaccination programmes. Abandoning this approach risks reversing hard-earned gains achieved over past two decades.

Mass sheltering, experts argue, compounds the risks. High-density animal housing is globally classified as a biohazard activity, requiring stringent quarantine, disease surveillance, and worker-safety protocols.

Supreme Court Directs Dogs Be Shifted From Schools, Bus Stands To Shelters; Petitioner Breaks Down

A coalition of multisectoral experts from a range of global institutions has lent its weight to petitioners in the stray dog case being heard in Supreme Court. The coalition warned that authorities’ proposals to remove and mass-shelter India’s free-living community dogs could undermine public health, go beyond the law, destabilise urban ecosystems and impose enormous fiscal costs, without delivering greater public safety.The cautionary note draws on experience of veterans in public health, behavioural science, veterinary medicine and law. Signatories include Chinny Krishna who pioneered India’s Animal Birth Control programme, evolutionary biologist Lee Dugatkin (University of Louisville, US), Anindita Bhadra of IISER Kolkata, public health expert Leena Menghaney, Pushpinder Singh Khera of AIIMS Jodhpur, and Julie Corfmat of Mission Rabies among a host of others. Organisations include International Companion Animal Network (ICAN), Pet Dog Trainers of Europe (PDTE), International Institute for Canine Ethics (IICE) and Bangalore Hundeskole Academy for Research and Canine Studies (BHARCS). Highlights of their analysis:Dugatkin noted claims justifying removal often rest on myths rather than biology. “These dogs have coexisted with humans in India for millennia. Disrupting stable populations based on fear or misinformation ignores everything we know about animal behaviour and disease ecology,” he said.Anthrozoologist Sindhoor Pangal said the debate had become detached from evidence. “Replacing proven, low-cost public-health systems with a mass-detention model is not just unscientific -- it actively increases risk while draining resources that should be strengthening vaccination and disease prevention,” she said.Position statements from IICE highlight that large shelters frequently experience overcrowding, stress-induced immunosuppression, and rapid disease transmission, particularly where enforcement capacity is limited.Free-living dogs play a role in urban ecosystems by scavenging waste and limiting proliferation of rats and other scavengers that can’t be vaccinated or monitored. Sudden dog removal can lead to rodent population explosions linked to diseases such as leptospirosis and plague.Legal experts point out that mass relocation directly contradicts the Animal Birth Control (Dog) Rules, 2023, which mandate sterilisation, vaccination, and return to the original territory. Large-scale confinement also raises constitutional and labour-safety concerns, given occupational hazards associated with mass animal housing.","A coalition of multisectoral experts from a range of global institutions has lent its weight to petitioners in the stray dog case being heard in supreme court.

Opposition slams Chhattisgarh govt as 'rat' theory blamed for vanishing paddy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-slams-chhattisgarh-govt-as-rat-theory-blamed-for-vanishing-paddy/articleshow/126555551.cms,"Opposition alleged the ‘rat’ explanation was a cover for the scam as paddy worth Rs 30 crore has either rotted, gone missing or been written off



RAIPUR: 'Rats' have become Chhattisgarh's newest political flashpoint after managers at paddy procurement centres blamed rodents, among other reasons, for paddy worth crores of rupees going missing or rotting.In Kabirdham district, about 26,000 quintals of paddy worth Rs 7 crore were reported 'damaged', dried or missing from two procurement centres. Officials initially cited rats, termites, and weather as reasons for the loss, triggering a backlash from opposition parties which alleged a statewide scam in grain procurement and storage.The state issued a clarification, stating that reduction in paddy weight due to moisture loss and minor pest-related damage is a scientific, natural and decades-old phenomenon, not evidence of corruption. Officials stressed that paddy loses weight when stored in open due to evaporation of moisture, a physical process recognised across all major paddy-producing states.However, opposition parties alleged the 'rat' explanation was a cover for the scam as paddy worth Rs 30 crore across Kabirdham, Mahasamund, Jashpur, and Bastar has either rotted, gone missing or been written off on account of pests, moisture, and weather.Janta Congress Chhattisgarh launched a 'wanted rats' campaign in Kabirdham's Kawardha, putting up posters across district. The party's state chief, Amit Jogi alleged, ""They are saying rats ate paddy. So, we have put up posters and are searching for this missing rat."" He urged people to tell the party ""whether these rats have four legs or two.""As the controversy grew, BJP MP Brijmohan Agrawal added fuel to the fire with a sarcastic remark that the govt would ""arrange cats for the treatment of rats"" accused of devouring paddy. Congress pounced on the comment, calling it proof that the govt was trivialising large-scale losses. Former CM Bhupesh Baghel posted on X, ""Guarantee of rats, good governance of rats.""","In kabirdham district, about 26,000 quintals of paddy worth rs 7 crore were reported 'damaged', dried or missing from two procurement centres.

MUMBAI: As Maharashtra heads to elections on Thursday for 29 municipal corporations, all eyes are on Mumbai, where the BJP-led Mahayuti is locked in a battle with the united Thackeray front for control of the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Polling for the 2,869 seats spread across 893 wards will begin at 7.30 am and conclude at 5.30 pm on January 15. A total of 3.48 crore voters are eligible to decide the fate of 15,931 candidates, including 1,700 in Mumbai and 1,166 in Pune. Counting of votes will take place on January 16.More than 25,000 police personnel, including senior officers, will be deployed across Mumbai to oversee elections to the BMC and vote counting. Except for Mumbai, the other 28 urban bodies have multi-member wards.This will be the Shiv Sena’s first BMC election since the 2022 split, when Eknath Shinde broke away with a majority of the party’s legislators, along with its name and symbol. The undivided Shiv Sena had held sway over the country’s richest civic body for 25 years.In a political turn ahead of the elections, estranged cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray reunited after two decades in their bid to consolidate Marathi votes, even as rival NCP factions forged a local alliance in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.In this election, the Opposition Congress has asserted its presence in Mumbai by stepping out of the shadow of its Maha Vikas Aghadi allies — Shiv Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar's NCP (SP). The Congress has joined hands with Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) and the Rashtriya Samaj Paksh in the state capital, even as it contests independently in Nagpur.Elections to 29 municipal corporations are being held after a gap of over six years, with their terms having ended between 2020 and 2023. Of these, nine fall within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the most urbanised belt in India.The battlegrounds include Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Kalyan-Dombivli, Kolhapur, Nagpur, Mumbai, Solapur, Amravati, Akola, Nashik, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Pune, Ulhasnagar, Thane, Chandrapur, Parbhani, Mira-Bhayandar, Nanded-Waghala, Panvel, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Latur, Malegaon, Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad, Jalgaon, Ahilyanagar, Dhule, Jalna, and Ichalkaranji.Chief Minister Fadnavis, along with his deputies Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar, campaigned extensively across Maharashtra, while cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray concentrated their efforts on Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, and Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, where Uddhav held a rally. Telangana minister Mohammad Azharuddin, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, and Tamil Nadu BJP leader K Annamalai were also among the star campaigners for the polls.Populist promises for women were the highlight of the manifestos of both the Mahayuti and the Shiv Sena (UBT)-MNS. The Mahayuti has promised a 50 per cent concession for women in BEST bus travel, while the Thackeray cousins have assured a Rs 1,500 monthly allowance for women domestic helps and a property tax waiver on houses up to 700 sq ft. The Congress manifesto, by contrast, prioritises combating Mumbai’s pollution, upgrading the BEST fleet, and strengthening the city’s financial health.The race for Mumbai’s mayoral post took centre stage in the campaign, with the BJP claiming that a Sena (UBT) victory could lead to a Muslim mayor, a charge the Uddhav Thackeray-led party countered by assuring voters of a Marathi mayor. CM Fadnavis also guaranteed that the mayor will be a ""Hindu and Marathi.""In the 227-ward Mumbai, the BJP is contesting 137 seats, the Shiv Sena 90, while the NCP is fighting separately on 94 seats. The Shiv Sena (UBT) has fielded 163 candidates, the MNS 52, the Congress 143 and the VBA 46. The Congress has fielded 1,263 candidates across the rest of the state.The Maharashtra State Election Commission on Friday announced that Thursday, January 15, will be a public holiday in areas falling under the 29 municipal corporations where polling will be held, an official said.The holiday will apply to government and semi-government offices, corporations, boards, public undertakings, banks, and central government offices within the jurisdiction of the civic bodies.The poll comission said administrative preparations, including readiness of EVMs, have been completed and urged the public to take an active part in the democratic exercise.","Elections to 29 municipal corporations are being held after a gap of over six years.

NEW DELHI: Exit polls have projected a massive victory for Mahayuti in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls, with the BJP–Shiv Sena alliance set to cross the 130-seat mark in Asia’s richest civic body. In contrast, the Shiv Sena (UBT)–MNS alliance is expected to lag far behind, with projections placing it at just over 60 seats. Congress is likely to get around 20 seats.While the Axis My India poll estimated 141 seats for the alliance, JVC has forecast a tally of 138 wards.Meanwhile, the much-anticipated reunion of estranged Thackeray cousins -- Uddhav and Raj -- after two decades appears unlikely to translate into significant electoral gains, with the Axis My India exit poll projecting just 63 seats for the alliance. The JVC poll estimated a similar outcome, forecasting 59 wards for the Shiv Sena (UBT)–MNS combine.The last BMC elections were held in 2017, and the term of the corporators ended on March 7, 2022. However, fresh polls could not be conducted on time due to delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, Supreme Court rulings on OBC reservations, and issues related to ward delimitation, resulting in the civic body being placed under an administrator.Nearly 50% polling was reported in Mumbai and 28 other municipal corporations across Maharashtra on Thursday.Addressing the media after voting concluded at 5.30pm, state election commissioner Dinesh Waghmare said voter turnout across the 29 civic bodies was estimated to be between 46 and 50%, adding that the final figures would be announced later.","Nearly 50% polling was reported in mumbai and 28 other municipal corporations across maharashtra on thursday.

JAMMU: Acting on court orders, Poonch Police attached the land of a Pakistan-based terror handler in the district’s Mandi tehsil, valued at more than Rs 22 lakh, on Thursday.The attachment was carried out in connection with an FIR registered at Mandi PS under Sections 2/3 of the Egress and Internal Movement (Control) Ordinance, 2005, the purpose of which is to control who can leave (egress) or move within the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir . The ordinance is used by law enforcement for cases involving alleged unlawful activities, such as individuals crossing borders for training or supporting anti-national actions.The land — spanning 10 kanals and 14 marlas — belonged to Abdul Aziz, a native of Chamber Kanari in Mandi, Poonch. He had earlier fled to Pakistan, from where he was currently operating as a terror handler. The fugitive has been actively involved in acts detrimental to India's security and sovereignty, a police spokesperson said.“Owing to his continued evasion of the legal process, the accused was declared a proclaimed offender by the court.

NEW DELHI: Axis My India’s exit poll has projected a sweeping victory for the BJP-led NDA in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections.According to the survey, the BJP+ alliance, comprising the BJP and the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, is predicted to win between 131 and 151 of the BMC’s 227 seats.The UBT+ bloc, which includes the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena, MNS and NCP (SP), is projected to secure 58–68 seats, while the Congress-led alliance is expected to manage just 12–16 seats. Others are likely to win between six and 12 seats.Polling across Mumbai and 28 other municipal corporations in Maharashtra saw an estimated turnout of 46–50 per cent, officials said, lower than the 55.53 per cent recorded in Mumbai during the 2017 civic polls.

Over 1,700 candidates were in the fray in Mumbai alone, with the civic body controlling an annual budget exceeding Rs 74,400 crore.The day was marred by controversy over claims that the indelible ink used on voters’ fingers could be easily removed.

ho said what?

ED's allegations against Mamata

Appearing before the bench of Justices Prashant Kumar Mishra and Vipul Pancholi, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta accused Mamata of ""barging in and interfered"", ""whenever statutory authorities exercised statutory power.""

""It reflects a very shocking pattern,"" Mehta said.

""The states will feel they can barge in, commit theft, and then sit on a dharna. Let an example be set; officers who were explicitly present there should be suspended,"" Mehta added.

Mehta said that there was evidence indicating ""incriminating material"" was present at the premises searched during the I-PAC raid in Kolkata.

Further, he accused Mamata of entering the premises where the raid was ongoing and taking way ""key"" evidence related to the probe.

He said local police authorities had been duly informed in advance and that senior officials, including the DGP, the CM, the commissioner of police, the local deputy commissioner of police (DCP), and a large police force, subsequently reached the spot.

""There was evidence leading to the conclusion that incriminating material was lying in a premise...local police was intimated...DGP, CM and Commissioner of Police and DCP of area, large police force, goes there...took material unauthorizedly. It's an offense of THEFT. She takes it away. Mobile of ED official also taken away. She even went before media...this will encourage officers to not discharge their duty. Forces will be demoralized. Let example be set. Officers who were present during exercise be placed under suspension and placed under departmental enquiry. Please take cognizance of what's happening,"" Mehta said.

Ma

mata's counter allegations

Appearing in behalf of Trinamool Congress chairman Mamata Banerjee, senior advocate Kapil Sibal submitted that the high court must first hear the matter and deliver its judgment, after which the parties could approach the appellate forum.

He argued that parallel proceedings had now been initiated, even though the High Court had jurisdiction under Article 226, and that this was the proper hierarchy to be followed.

Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal said that IPAC had a large amount of party data, and when the ED went there, it knew that sensitive party information would be present.

Sibal also referred to the video recording of the raid and said, ""It is a blatant lie that all digital devices were taken. Allegation that CM Mamata Banerjee took all devices is a lie, substantiated by ED's own panchnama (search record).""

""The last statement in the coal scam was recorded in February 2024; what was ED doing since then? Why so keen in the midst of elections?"" he posed.

Meanwhile, senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, appearing for the State and the DGP, raised a strong objection to the maintainability of the petition.

He submitted that if notice was to be issued, it should be made clear that it would be subject to their objection on maintainability.

Singhvi argued that a direct approach to the Supreme Court by the ED was permissible only in exceptional situations where no effective remedy was available. He also objected to forum shopping, pointing out that broadly similar reliefs had already been sought before the high court.

Senior Advocate Abhishek Singhvi argued that either the allegations made in the plea were incorrect or the panchnama itself was false, as both could not stand together

He said that claims of obstruction and inability to conduct the search were untrue in light of the panchnama. Referring to the Solicitor General’s statement that the authorities were informed, Singhvi contended that the State received only a casual email at around 11:30 am, even though the search had begun at 6:45 am. He urged the ED to place clear instructions on record and alleged that the exercise was merely an attempt to cover tracks and create a paper trail.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday issued notice to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and other state officials on the allegations levelled by Enforcement Directorate over the raids on I-PAC -- a political consultancy firm linked to Trinamool CongressThe top court sought the response from chief minister within two weeks.The bench of Justices Prashant Kumar Mishra and Vipul Pancholi also restrained West Bengal Police from conducting probe on FIR registered against ED and its officials.“Issue notice to the respondents. Counter affidavit be filed within two weeks. Post the matter on February 3, 2026. In the meanwhile it is directed that, the respondents (West Bengal government) shall preserve the CCTV cameras at I-PAC and other cameras containing the footage of nearby areas,"" the bench said.The bench also reacted to the Calcutta HC chaos on January 9 that led to the adjournment of the court. It said that it was “disturbed” by the commotion at the HC that resulted in the adjournment of the hearing on the ED’s plea against the Mamata Banerjee government over the I-PAC raids. Responding to the ED’s allegation that the TMC had “instructed” people to assemble at the high court, the apex court questioned whether the courtroom had been turned into a protest venue like Jantar Mantar.“Come everyone? As if it’s Jantar Mantar!”, Justice Mishra remarked.This comes following the central agency's raid on I-PAC and its chief Pratik Jain at Kolkata's Salt Lake on January 8.The ED alleged that chief minister Mamata Banerjee interfered during the raids, removed digital devices and key documents with police support, and forced officials to terminate the searches without making any seizures.","I-pac raid row: sc halts wb police firs against ed, seeks mamata’s reply.

Thalapathy Vijay’s Jana Nayagan Gets Morning Relief, Evening Setback — Next Hearing Jan 21

NEW DELHI: In a big setback to actor Vijay, the Supreme Court on Thursday refused to entertain a plea against an order of stay passed by a division bench of the Madras high court over the certification of his movie ""Jana Nayagan"".The top court asked KVN production to raise its grievances before a division bench of the Madras HC, which is examining the issue.A bench of Justices Deepankar Datta and AG Masih asked the Madras high court to decide the matter by January 20.On January 9, the Madras high court stayed a single judge’s order directing the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) to immediately grant a censor certificate to Jana Nayagan, leaving the fate of actor-turned-politician Vijay’s film uncertain.KVN Productions LLP moved an appeal against the single judge’s directive, after a division bench of the high court last Friday put the order on hold and restrained the CBFC from issuing the certificate.Vijay recently launched his political party, the Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam.“Jana Nayagan”, widely projected as Vijay’s final film before his full-time entry into politics, was scheduled for a Pongal release on January 9.However, the release hit last-minute hurdles after the CBFC failed to issue certification in time.The division bench’s order came hours after Justice P T Asha directed the CBFC to clear “Jana Nayagan”, setting aside the film board’s decision to refer the matter to a review committee.Subsequently, the first bench comprising Chief Justice M M Shrivastava and Justice G Arul Murugan, acting on an appeal filed by the CBFC, granted an interim stay on the single judge’s verdict.Earlier, while allowing KVN Productions’ plea seeking a direction to the CBFC to issue the censor certificate, Justice Asha held that once the board had decided to grant certification, the chairperson had no authority to refer the film to a review committee.The film board immediately challenged the order before the division bench.","Vijay recently launched his political party, the tamilaga vettri kazhagam. “jana nayagan’, widely projected as vijay’s final film before his full-time entry into politics, was scheduled for a pongal release on january 9.

It asked the survivor's counsel to file relevant documents by Jan 31 and told Sengar and the CBI to file their replies to the plea.The survivor's plea also seeks a directive to record evidence of two officials from her school in Unnao to certify her date of birth. She alleged that Sengar influenced the probe and used forged documents about her age in the trial. These, she said, were now being relied upon in his appeal and this can be negated by tabling the additional evidence.Last month, HC had suspended Sengar's life imprisonment, saying he had already undergone seven years and five months of incarceration.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Election Commission to make public the names of people excluded from the draft electoral rolls published after the special intensive revision process in Kerala to enable affected voters to raise objections. A bench headed by Chief Justice Surya Kant also asked the poll panel to consider extending the deadline, preferably by two weeks, for filing objections against the deletion of names. The counsel, appearing for EC, said that the issue of extension of deadline will be considered. The bench was hearing a batch of petitions challenging the special intensive revision (SIR) process undertaken in Kerala.The petitioners include Kerala, senior political netas such as PK Kunhalikutty of IUML and MV Govindan Master of CPM.The pleas have said the SIR process, as currently executed, risks disenfranchising a massive segment of the population due to technical errors and a lack of a robust redressal mechanism. During the brief hearing, the counsel appearing for the petitioners submitted that according to the draft rolls released after the revision, nearly 24 lakh names had been deleted.It was argued that while voters are required to file objections against deletion, the list of excluded persons has not been made accessible, effectively denying them a meaningful opportunity to contest the removal of their names.""They have to list objections, but the list of those persons deleted is not available. Now people have to file objections stating why have you deleted me... that opportunity is missing for us,"" one lawyer said.The petitioners further said that in the draft rolls, some voters have been erroneously shown as deceased, while others have been marked as residing outside the state. The lack of transparency has caused serious difficulties for voters, particularly in rural areas.","The supreme court on thursday asked the election commission to make public the names of people excluded from the draft electoral rolls.

NEW DELHI: In an unprecedented move, ED Thursday moved SC seeking to implead Union home ministry and DoPT (department of personnel & training) in its ongoing legal battle with Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee over her alleged attempt to foil ED's search operation against I-PAC in Kolkata in a coal 'scam' case.ED's fresh appeal comes at a time when the agency is checking the veracity of reports that WB chief secretary Nandini Chakravorty was among the officials accompanying the CM when she rushed to political consultancy firm I-PAC chief Pratik Jain's residence when the central agency's search was underway.The development coincided with SC taking up ED's criminal writ petition for hearing and issuing notice to the CM and top state officials, including Bengal DGP Rajeev Kumar. SC termed the incident of disruption of ED's Jan 8 search proceedings as ""serious"" and promised to look into the larger issue of state agencies interfering in actions of central agencies.Bengal govt's response - to ED's fresh, or additional, appeal - will be worth watching if reports are confirmed, and if ED, as indications are, brings it to the notice of SC during the next hearing on the matter. The state has justified DGP Kumar accompanying Mamata to Jain's residence by saying that the CM was a 'Z-category protectee'.In its additional appeal Thursday, ED sought ""impleadment of proposed respondents 7-9"" as party respondents in present criminal writ petition, failing which, it said, the agency ""shall suffer irreparable loss and injury"".Respondent No. 7 is DoPT through its secretary, respondent No. 8 is home ministry through its secretary, and respondent No. 9 is State of WB through its chief secretary.CM Mamata has been made respondent No. 2 in ED's criminal petition before SC; DGP Kumar is respondent No. 3; Kolkata police Commissioner Manoj Verma is respondent No 4; Priyabrata Roy, DCP South Kolkata, is respondent No. 5; and CBI is respondent No. 6.ED argued that respondents 7-9 ""are necessary/proper parties in the present matter"" to initiate actions against the erring senior police officers, who were allegedly party to the disruption of ED's search proceedings.""That it is, therefore, most respectfully prayed that this court may be pleased to implead proposed respondents 7 to 9 as party respondents in present writ petition (criminal), failing which the petitioner shall suffer irreparable loss and injury,"" ED said.ED sought SC directions to respondents ""herein, i.e. to initiate departmental inquiry/proceedings for major penalty against respondents 3-5 along with other police officials and to place the said respondents No. 3-5 with other police officials under suspension"".This is not the first time that Kumar has been entangled in a legal battle with central agencies.

NEW DELHI: Terming the clash between Enforcement Directorate (ED) and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee as very serious, with wider implications, Supreme Court Thursday issued notice to the CM and state officials on the central agency's plea to initiate action against them for preventing it from discharging its duty in the alleged coal scam case.The court granted them two weeks to file responses and stayed the FIR registered by the West Bengal police against ED officials.""We are of the prima facie opinion that the present petition has raised a serious issue related to the investigation by ED or other central agencies and its interference by state agencies,"" a bench of Justices Prashant Kumar Mishra and Vipul M Pancholi said.""According to us, for furtherance of rule of law in the country, and to allow each organ to function independently, it is necessary to examine the issue so that the offenders are not allowed to be protected under the shield of the law enforcement agencies of a particular state,"" the bench said. The same situation could crop up in other states if these issues remained undecided, it said.The outcome of this litigation would assume significance as clashes between Centre and opposition-governed states have become frequent, with the state blaming Centre for using its agencies, particularly CBI and ED, for political purposes and the Centre accusing the states for protecting their corrupt ministers and officials by not allowing its probe agency to function.It said, ""The larger questions involved in the present manner, which if allowed to remain undecided, would further worsen the situation and there will be a situation of lawlessness prevailing in one or the other state, considering that different political outfits are governing different places."" ""True that any central agency does not have any power to interfere with election work of any party. But if central agency is bona fide investigating any serious offence, the question arises whether in the guise of taking shield of party activities, agencies can be restricted from carrying out duties,"" the SC said.The bench, at the outset, raised the question of maintainability of Enforcement Directorate's writ petition. But it made up its mind to examine the petition after solicitor general Tushar Mehta explained how the incident took place and the manner in which Calcutta high court was prevented from hearing its plea on the first date. ""This is serious and we have to examine it,"" the bench said after SG Mehta's argument.Mehta, also flanked by additional solicitors general S V Raju and Vikramajit Banerjee, told SC that the CM, along with senior state police officials, including the DGP, barged into the premises where ED was conducting its raid in an illegal coal mining 'scam' and took away evidence. He said the CM and state officials staged a dharna and prevented the agency from discharging its duty. ""If no action is taken then the central force would get demoralised. .. Let erring officers be put on suspension to set an example that they cannot do dharna and block investigation,"" the SG said.Mehta informed the bench that this was not the first time that such an incident had taken place, and earlier, CBI officers were arrested by Bengal police after they went to question the then Kolkata police commissioner.ED's plea was strongly objected to by senior advocates Kapil Sibal, Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Shyam Diwan, appearing for the CM, the state and its officials, respectively. They submitted that ED's action was meant to disrupt the upcoming West Bengal assembly elections.Questioning the motive behind the raid of I-PAC premises, a political consultant of the Mamata-led TMC, Sibal, appearing for her, said, ""The first question which arises is why was there a need to go there in the midst of an election? The last statement in the coal mining scam was recorded in Feb 2024. What were they doing in 2024 and 2025, and why are they so keen in the midst of elections in 2026? If you get hold of the information, how will we fight the elections? This is why the party chairperson (Mamata) has the right to go there. It is the property of the party...It is a completely mala fide exercise by ED to disturb the election process by gathering confidential information.""Singhvi submitted that ED, which first moved the HC, is resorting to ""forum shopping"" by filing a case in SC. He said the issue could be examined in HC. As the bench raised the issue of commotion created in the high court on first hearing on Jan 9, Singhvi said emotions were running high on the first day but the hearing went on very smoothly on Wednesday. He further submitted that the entire search was done peacefully as as per the panchnama, which is diametrically opposite the contention raised in the petition. He said local police was initially in dark as the search operations started at 6am, and the email communication was sent only at 11.30am.The bench, after hearing both the sides, passed an order and also stayed FIR lodged by the state against ED officials and directed the police to preserve CCTV footage and other evidence.","The court granted them two weeks to file responses and stayed the fir registered by the west bengal police against ed officials.
