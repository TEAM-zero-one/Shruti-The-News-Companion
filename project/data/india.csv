Ahmadi said the PoW (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 barred high court from entertaining any suit that intended to change the religious character of the structure to one other than what it was on Aug 15, 1947. For the Hindu side, advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain said since the Idgah was a protected monument under ASI Act, it would not come under the ambit of PoW Act. When Ahmadi protested Jain's stand, the bench said, ""If you take defence under the 1991 Act, they are entitled to counter it by arguing the Act is not applicable to the structure.""The bench said that it had on Dec 12 barred courts from passing any interim order in suits relating to temple-mosque disputes and asked courts not to entertain any fresh suit for reclamation of temples which were converted into mosques during Islamic rule, including disputes relating to Varanasi's Gyanvapi-Kashi Viswanath and Mathura's Shahi Idgah-Srikrishna Janmasthan. The bench on Dec 12 also directed, ""In pending suits, trial courts will not pass any effective and final order including orders for survey till the next date of hearing.""Allahabad HC had on Aug 1 last year ruled that suits were not barred by any provisions of Waqf Act, PoW Act, Specific Relief Act, Limitation Act or Civil Procedure Code.

I am not ready for any quarrel (related to the next chief and whether he has any preference for any particular leader) and I am not in the race,"" Annamalai said when asked about the issue.Annamalai's announcement, which comes days after AIADMK general secretary and Tamil Nadu leader of opposition Edappadi K Palaniswami ( EPS ) met Union home minister Amit Shah, gives credence to reports that the BJP may be exploring an alliance with its former partner for the assembly elections in the state due next year.Amit Shah-EPS meeting last month sparked intense political speculation about a possible revival of the AIADMK-BJP alliance in the state. However, reports claimed that AIADMK had put Annamalai's ouster as state party chief a precondition for any possible tie-up.The AIADMK and BJP were alliance partners in the 2021 state elections, during which the saffron party won four seats. However, the relationship between the two parties suffered after Annamalai made a controversial reference to late AIADMK supremo and former chief minister J Jayalalithaa's conviction in a corruption case.Senior AIADMK leaders accused Annamalai of disrespecting the alliance's spirit and failing to recognise the AIADMK's leadership within the state coalition.In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the two parties fought separately, forming independent alliances and both suffered in the process as the DMK-led coalition swept all seats in Tamil Nadu.With chief minister M K Stalin already in election mode for the assembly polls next year, perhaps both the BJP and the AIADMK realise the importance of coming together. EPS has announced that for his party the DMK was the ""sole enemy"" and he was ready to join hands with any like-minded party for an alliance.However, the big question is: Can AIADMK treat BJP as like-minded party given the issues that the saffron party has pushed for in the recent past - the three-language formula, the Waqf Bill. Will the AIADMK gain from this alliance? Also, will this tieup take away from the BJP all the gains it had made in the last few years under Annamalai who projected BJP as an alternative to the state parties?Political analysts feel that BJP's stand on the three-language formula and the passage of the Waqf Bill may make the AIADMK nervous about the possible electoral fallout.""The BJP's agenda on delimitation, Neet, language policy, Waqf Bill makes the saffron party a difficult partner in Tamil Nadu for any regional party, says Vijaya Sankar, senior journalist and political analyst.He feels the BJP and AIADMK will have to woo other parties and make a grand coalition if it wants to challenge the DMK-led front, which, according to him has already got a head-start thanks to some smart moves made by chief minister M K Stalin.""All existing political players would be keenly watching the moves of actor-turned-politician Vijay. He is the unknown factor in the next elections and it remains to be seen who suffers due to his presence in the political arena,"" says Vijaya Sankar.Elections in Tamil Nadu are still a year away. The BJP may have to tone down the issues it has been raking up in the state if it wants a coalition. But one thing is certain, if the BJP-AIADMK coalition indeed happens, Annamalai will perhaps be the biggest loser.",State bjp president k annamalai said he was not in the race for the post of the next state unit chief. His announcement comes days after aiadmk leader of opposition edappadi k palaniswami met union home minister amit shah.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119988284,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1097978,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Poll Do you think the Waqf Amendment Bill will positively impact the community? No Yes

NEW DELHI: The leaders of Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal United or JD(U) went on a resigning spree over their disagreement with the party's support for the passage of the contentious Waqf Amendment Bill in the Parliament.Not one or two but at least five leaders submitted their resignations as the bill was passed, first in Lok Sabha and then the Rajya Sabha on Thursday and Friday, respectively.The latest to resign from the party was Nadeem Akhtar, his resignation follows that of four other leaders, including JD(U) leader Raju Nayyar, Tabrez Siddiqui Alig, Mohammad Shahnawaz Malik, and Mohammed Kasim Ansari.While Nadeem, Raju, and Tabrez resigned on Friday, Shahnawaz and Mohammaed Kasim Ansari submitted their resignation on Thursday.Raju Nayyar wrote in his resignation, ""I resign from JD(U) after the Waqf Amendment Bill is passed and supported in the Lok Sabha.""He went on to express his deep disappointment with the party, stating, ""I am deeply hurt by the JD(U) voting in favour of this black law, which oppresses Muslims.""""I resign from the post of former state secretary of JD(U) youth and primary membership of the party. I request to send a letter to the Honorable CM Nitish Kumar and relieve me from all responsibilities,"" he added.Meanwhile, Independent MP from Purnia, Pappu Yadav, claimed that the Bihar chief minister and the JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar was not in a good mental state and that he was no longer in control of his party. ""Nitish Kumar ji's mental state is not very good at present. In his party, 90 per cent of the leaders are against SC/ST but aligned to the BJP. After 5 PM on the day voting takes place in Bihar, the BJP will no longer need Nitish Kumar.. JD(U) is not in the hands of Nitish ji now,"" Yadav said while talking to the news agency ANI.In a letter to JDU national president and Bihar chief minister, Tabrez Siddiqui Alig conveyed strong disappointment, accusing the party of ""betraying the trust of the Muslim community.""Meanwhile, Shahnawaz Malik wrote in his letter, ""Millions of Indian Muslims like us firmly believed that you stood for a truly secular ideology. That belief now stands shattered.""“Millions of Indian Muslims like us had unwavering faith that you are the flag bearer of a purely secular ideology. But now, this belief has been shattered. Millions of dedicated Indian Muslims and activists like us are deeply shocked by JDU's stand regarding the Waqf Bill Amendment Act 2024,” reads the letter written by Shah Nawaz Malik.Moreover, Ansari wrote that the Waqf Bill was “against Indian Muslims” and could not be accepted “under any circumstances.”“This bill violates many fundamental rights of the Constitution. Through this bill, Indian Muslims are being humiliated and insulted. Neither you nor your party realises this. I regret that I gave many years of my life to the party,” he wrote.However, JD(U) national spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad responded to Ansari and Malik's resignations, saying that neither Ansari, from East Champaran, nor Malik, from Jamui, were officially part of the party.Ansari, in a letter shared on social media, identified himself as the medical cell president of JD(U) in East Champaran and claimed he was a candidate from the Dhaka assembly seat. However, JD(U) did not contest that seat in the 2020 elections. The Dhaka seat was won by BJP’s Pawan Jaiswal, a JD(U) ally.Speaking to the news agency PTI, Prasad said, ""I wonder what to say about things. I have been associated with the party for a long time. I say with full responsibility that neither person has been a part of our rank and file.""He also said, ""We admit that some genuine members of our party, like national general secretary Ghulam Rasool Baliyawi, are not very happy with the passage of the Bill. Their grievances will be dealt with at the appropriate level. But those who are coming up with the claim of resignation from the party were never members in the first place.""Earlier on Thursday, Baliyawi and Syed Afzal Abbas, who heads the Bihar Shia Waqf Board, also shared concerns about the Bill. They said that several suggestions made by Muslim leaders during meetings with the Joint Parliamentary Committee were not included. However, they did not criticise the party’s support for the Bill.Parliament approved the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025 in the early hours of Friday after a detailed discussion in the Rajya Sabha. The Bill passed in the Rajya Sabha with 128 members voting in favour and 95 against. It had been earlier cleared in the Lok Sabha, where 288 MPs supported it and 232 voted against the bill.The Waqf Bill issue is expected to remain active in Bihar until the state assembly elections later this year.Recently, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) held a protest in Patna, asking Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and NDA allies like Chirag Paswan to stop the Bill.Nitish Kumar has said he follows the ideas of Jayaprakash Narayan and Ram Manohar Lohia and often talks about his record on supporting secular values, even while being a BJP ally since the 1990s.At a recent event also attended by Union home minister Amit Shah, he mentioned his government’s work for minorities and criticised the RJD, which was in power for 15 years, for failing to prevent Hindu-Muslim clashes despite getting Muslim votes.The RJD, Congress, and Left parties are expected to raise the Waqf Bill issue during the election campaign to criticise the JD(U) and try to gain the support of Muslim voters for the Mahagathbandhan alliance.","Leaders of nitish kumar-led janata dal united or jd(u) went on a resigning spree over their disagreement with the party's support for the passage of the contentious waqf amendment bill.

Tyeb Mehta's bull run continues: 2nd priciest Indian painting at 61.8cr,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tyeb-mehtas-bull-run-continues-2nd-priciest-indian-painting-at-61-8cr/articleshow/119957048.cms,"His work is worth crores, but Tyeb struggled most of his life

The bull run seems to be truly on in the Indian market, and who better to capture its animal spirits than Tyeb Mehta, the celebrated modernist who made the bull his enduring motif?Less than a fortnight after a work by his contemporary M F Husain joined the Rs 100-crore club, Mehta's 'Trussed Bull' (1956) went for Rs 61.8 crore ($7.27 million), becoming the second most expensive Indian painting sold at auction globally. It is now tied with Amrita Sher-Gil 's 'The Story Teller', which sold for the same price in 2023. Mehta's powerful image of a shackled and subjugated bull went for nearly nine times its higher estimate at a Saffronart auction in Mumbai on Wednesday.This is not the first time Mehta, who lived in Mumbai most of his life and passed away in 2009, has raised the bar for Indian art. In 2002, his triptych, 'Celebration', from The Times of India's collection, made history as the first modern Indian artwork to sell for over a crore (Rs 1.5 crore at Christie's).It was a Tyeb work again ('Mahishasura') which crossed the $1m mark for the first time in 2005. Now, he has set another benchmark for Indian art. Wednesday's auction was also a benchmark for homegrown auction house Saffronart, which celebrated its 25th anniversary with an auction that raked in a record-breaking $25 million. ""It's a global record for an Indian art auction . It shows the strength of the art market when other asset classes are struggling,"" said Dinesh Vazirani, Saffronart CEO and co-founder. ""It's even more meaningful because it is Mehta's centenary year.""The proceeds will go to the Mehta family since the work was from their collection. For most of his life, the artist lived in a cramped one-room apartment that was studio by day and bedroom at night. It was only in the 1990s that he and his wife Sakina could afford to move into a two-bedroom place in Lokhandwala. ""Like many other artist wives of that period, Sakina supported him. She used to work as a teacher,"" said Kishore Singh, senior VP at DAG (formerly Delhi Art Gallery).His work now goes for sums that are as jaw-dropping as his pregnant Kali and avenging yet tender Durga but to talk of Mehta purely in terms of zeroes does no justice to the man and the ideals he lived by. ""The power of painting was far more important to him than the prices it commanded,"" said Singh, narrating an anecdote from Delhi gallerist Arun Vadehra who was close to Mehta. ""Arun used to have one of his paintings hanging in his office. One day, Mehta took it away, only to replace it later with another work. When Arun asked, he said he had ripped the earlier painting because he wasn't happy with it. Tyeb may not have been very prolific but he stayed true to his art.""Mehta's strong imagery was always rooted in his life, with his canvases charting the tumult around him - the horrors of Partition, the struggles of a newly independent India and the violence of the 1992 Bombay riots. In an interview, he recounted his memories of Partition. ""At the time, I was living on Mohammed Ali Road, which was virtually a Muslim ghetto. I remember watching a young man being slaughtered in the street below my window. The crowd beat him to death, smashed his head with stones."" Those images haunted him for life, as did the sight of bullocks being led to slaughter at an abattoir in Bombay. The bull, Mehta later said, was important to him on many levels. ""The way they tie up the animal's legs and fling it on the floor of the slaughterhouse before butchering it... you feel something very vital has been lost. The trussed bull also seemed representative of the national condition... the mass of humanity unable to channel or direct its tremendous energies...""In the winter of his life, Mehta's vision was impaired. ""Those primary colours that he used so much was because his sight was affected,"" explained Singh. But he continued to paint, a perfectionist till the end.","Tyeb mehta's 'trussed bull' is the second most expensive indian painting sold at auction globally. It is now tied with amrita sher-gil's 'the story teller', which sold for the same price in 2023.
