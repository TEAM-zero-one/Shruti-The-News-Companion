Ginza Vualzong, the organisation's secretary of information and publicity, clarified that a recent appeal to residents of Kangpokpi to cooperate with central security forces was only meant to ensure no fingers were pointed at them for anything untoward occurring on that stretch.KZC said the appeal shouldn't be interpreted as a call for unrestricted movement across buffer zones separating Meitei and Kuki-Zo territories, the two communities involved in the ethnic conflict that flared up in April 2023.Vualzong said it was solely the Union govt's responsibility to keep NH-2 safe for traffic by deploying ""neutral"" central forces.The response came soon after the MHA hailed what it termed a ""significant decision"" by KZC to reopen the highway.The ministry's statement mentioned that the breakthrough was the outcome of a series of meetings in Delhi with the Kuki leadership over the past few days to get them to lift the blockade.On MHA stressing on ""free movement"" of civilian and goods traffic on NH-2, the Kuki leadership said it the community wasn't accountable beyond cooperating with forces deployed for security. ""It's not duty of the local public or KZC to guarantee security. The ministry of home affairs has assured us that adequate central forces will be deployed,"" the council said. Running through a swathe of Kangpokpi, NH-2 is a corridor for fuel, food and medical supplies. Any disruption, real or perceived, has a cascading effect on Meitei-majority Imphal Valley.Since the outbreak of ethnic violence, the highway has become a symbol of the fractured relationship between the Meitei and Kuki communities.KZC expressed surprise at the noise over NH-2, saying the highway hadn't witnessed any trouble in recent months. The Centre should be focusing on strengthening security along the, it said.","Kuki-zo council (kzc), which represents the community, said the stretch of nh-2 passing through kuki-inhabited areas had been open to traffic all along.

Rampal, of Satlok Ashram in Barwala, Hisar in Haryana, has been in jail for over a decade since his arrest.The division bench of justices Gurvinder Singh Gill and Deepinder Singh Nalwa ordered, ""The applicant (Rampal) is directed not to promote any kind of 'mob mentality' and avoid participating in congregations where there is any kind of tendency amongst 'disciples' or participants to cause a breach in peace, law, and order"".

'Only Mistake I Made Was...': Prajwal Revanna Tells Court Before Life Sentence In Rape Case

Poll Do you think protests will effectively change the political situation in Punjab? Yes No





PATIALA: AAP MLA Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra has allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.According to Punjab Police sources, Pathanmajra and his accomplices fired at police officers during the escape and even ran over one personnel, leaving him injured.According to reports, Pathanmajra and his accomplices ran over police personnel with an SUV.The Sanour MLA was arrested a day after publicly criticising his party’s Delhi leadership.His detention in Patiala was linked to a rape case filed against him, sparking political uproar in the region.In a social media post, Pathanmajra claimed the case related to his former wife and alleged that the fresh charges of rape were politically motivated.“I was booked because I raised my voice against my own government, especially the Delhi leadership,” he wrote.His brother, Hardev Singh, said the MLA was taken into custody under Section 376 of the IPC despite already having been granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. “He was arrested from Dabri in Haryana in a case where bail was already granted. This is clearly an attempt to silence him,” he alleged.CIA Patiala confirmed that three weapons have been recovered and one accomplice of MLA Pathanmajra has been arrested.The arrested individual has been identified as Balwinder Singh, while the search for MLA Pathanmajra continues.Police said two officers were injured when stones were thrown at them during the MLA’s escape attempt.Authorities added that supporters of the MLA not only pelted stones but also opened fire at the police team.Before his arrest, Pathanmajra had appealed to colleagues and supporters via Facebook to protest outside the Patiala SSP’s office at the Mini Secretariat. He urged people to reach “in tractors, trolleys, and cars” to demand his release. “I will not be silenced even if more cases are registered against me. Will AAP’s Delhi leadership rule Punjabis now? Even Congress and BJP did not interfere to this extent,” he said.The MLA has repeatedly accused the party’s central leadership of sidelining Punjab leaders and “remote-controlling” the state. Recently, he criticised officials of the Irrigation Department over flood relief efforts in his constituency. Soon after, his security cover was withdrawn and police officers in the area were reshuffled — moves that raised eyebrows.“This is retaliation. They looted Punjab more than Abdali. Now they want to sell Punjab,” Pathanmajra declared.","Harmeet singh pathanmajra allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.

Massive Chaos in Bengal Assembly: BJP and TMC Trade 'Chor' Jibes, Mamata Speech Triggers Ruckus

NEW DELHI: The West Bengal Assembly on Thursday witnessed uproar as MLAs of the ruling TMC and opposition BJP raised slogans, disrupting a discussion on a government resolution concerning alleged atrocities against Bengali migrants.The disruption began when chief minister Mamata Banerjee was about to speak on the resolution. BJP legislators raised slogans and questioned the suspension of Leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari on September 2, leading to strong protests from the treasury benches.Addressing the House, Banerjee accused the BJP of being against Bangla-speaking people.""I condemn BJP for their persecution of Bengalis. A time will soon come when not a single BJP MLA will remain in Bengal. The people themselves will ensure it. BJP will face inevitable defeat, for no party that wages linguistic terror against Bengalis can ever win Bengal,"" she said.She also called the BJP a party of ""vote chor"".""BJP is a party of vote-chors, corrupt to the core, persecutors of Bengalis, and masters of deception. BJP is a national disgrace, and I condemn them in the strongest terms,"" Banerjee said.The chief minister further accused the BJP of blocking a discussion on alleged attacks on Bengali migrant workers in BJP-ruled states.""Why is the BJP against discussion on the attacks on Bengali migrants? It is because these incidents are taking place in states ruled by the party. They want to suppress the truth,"" she claimed.Amid continuous sloganeering, Banerjee asked, ""Why is the BJP not allowing me to speak in this House?""She added, ""We are not against Hindi or any other language, but the BJP is clearly anti-Bengali. Their attitude shows a colonial and dictatorial mindset. They want to turn West Bengal into their colony.""As the protests continued, Speaker Biman Banerjee suspended BJP chief whip Shankar Ghosh for the rest of the day for creating disorder. When Ghosh refused to leave, assembly marshals were called in and he was dragged out of the House.Later, BJP MLAs Agnimitra Paul, Mihir Goswami, Bankim Ghosh and Ashok Dinda were subsequently suspended as the ruckus intensified.BJP legislators alleged that water bottles were thrown at them from the treasury benches during the commotion.Marshals remained on guard inside the House to prevent any physical clash between the two sides.Banerjee criticised the conduct of BJP legislators, saying they were trying to derail a discussion on the situation of Bengali migrants.Intensifying her criticism, the Bengal CM also alleged that the BJP’s ""ideological ancestors"" had betrayed the country during the freedom movement.""The BJP is a party of dictators. Their ancestors did not fight for India’s Independence; they betrayed the country,"" she said.As the exchanges grew heated, some MLAs from the treasury benches moved towards the opposition benches, prompting marshals to step in. The uproar forced Banerjee to briefly pause her speech.She further alleged that the BJP-led Union government had ""sold the prestige"" of India before foreign powers, claiming that the Centre was ""at times begging before the United States, and at times before China.""Meanwhile, replying to CM Mamata Banerjee's address in the House, West Bengal LoP and BJP MLA Suvendu Adhikari, ""She abused the Modi community...Mamata Banerjee will have to go. A case will be registered against her.""Despite the ruckus, the House was not adjourned.","The disruption began when chief minister mamata banerjee was about to speak on the resolution.

""We have taken note of seriousness of the situation. Videos of flash floods show large numbers of logs being swept down and is a prima facie indicator of illegal cutting down of trees in the hills,"" he said.Turning to solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who was present in the courtroom for another case, the CJI told the law officer to take note of the serious problem and illegal felling of trees. Mehta said he would get in touch with the secretary in MoEF&CC and request him to discuss the issue with environment secretaries of the states concerned.""We have interfered with nature so much that it is now giving back,"" Mehta said. The CJI agreed and said time has come to take drastic steps to preserve whatever we have and strictly adhere to the path of sustainable development.Rana, in her PIL, alleged that failure of environmental authorities to preserve the pristine ecology of the Himalayan region, flagrant violation of the hill road construction code, and encroachment of water channels and water bodies constitute the cocktail of reasons for the vicissitudes of nature to wreak havoc through unprecedented rains.The petitioner sought ""formation of a SIT involving experts to find out the reasons for these disasters, determine responsibilities of officials, suggest measures to help protect the ecology of Himalayan States"" and keep their population safe from disasters.","Supreme court decides to investigate allegations made through a pil.

Yet, her name allegedly appeared as a voter in the New Delhi constituency roll in 1980, was deleted in 1982, and re-entered in 1983 after she formally became a citizen.The plea has been moved before Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Vaibhav Chaurasia under Section 175(4) of the BNSS.""What documents were given to the Election Commission when her name was included in 1980?"" senior advocate Pavan Narang, appearing for complainant Vikas Tripathi, asked in court. He argued that the unexplained deletion raised suspicion, adding that only a citizen could be listed as a voter.Narang submitted that ""some forgery"" may have occurred, with a public authority ""cheated,"" and requested the court to direct police to register an FIR.The court has posted the matter for September 10.","A plea has been filed in a delhi court seeking action against congress veteran sonia gandhi.

AIIMS experts have found that senior doctors of Lady Hardinge Medical College (LHMC) wrongly certified two hearing impaired NEET-qualified students as ineligible for reservation for persons with disabilities (PWD). Despite their Unique Disability ID stating that the percentage of disability of the two candidates was 63% and 50%, the three-member LHMC board certified them as 14% and 2% respectively.An AIIMS board was constituted on the Delhi High Court’s direction after the two students filed against the certification. After conducting a battery of tests, the AIIMS experts certified the two candidates’ disability level as 66.5% and 43.13%. This incident has raised questions about other candidates who might have been disqualified by the same board, but who could not afford to approach the court.Based on the AIIMS report, the court ordered that the two candidates be allowed to participate in the second round of counselling for MBBS admission. Wrong certification by the LHMC doctors led to them missing the first round of counselling.Disability rights activists have demanded an enquiry into the certification process in LHMC and against the doctors who wrongly certified the students.The LHMC medical board consisted of Prof Dr A Chakravati and assistant professors Dr Pallika Kumar and Dr Raman Kumar.Unique disability ID, issued by designated health authorities, was launched as asingle document of identification and verification of the disabled for availing various benefits in future. Only those whose disability level is 40% or above are eligible for the 5% disability quota seats in MBBS admission.“Much uproar is raised over fake disability certificates, but who questions the doctors on three-member medical boards who arbitrarily assign percentages? With clearly gazetted assessment guidelines in place, how can 50-60% suddenly shrink to 2% or 14%? These are not mere mistakes, but grave blunders that crush students’ careers and amount to medical negligence,” said Dr Satendra Singh, a founder member of Doctors with Disabilities: Agents of Change, India’s largest network of health professionals with disabilities. Dr Singh demanded that accountability be fixed for this negligence.The candidates were evaluated clinically and audiologically through five different tests. The first two (Pure Tone Audiometry and Speech audiometry) are subjective hearing tests as response depends upon the cooperation of the patients.However, the next three (Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry or BERA/ABR, otoacoustic emission and impedance audiometry) are objective hearing test that do not require the cooperation of the patient and therefore are being utilized with an increased frequency for detecting malingering or to determine if a candidate is feigning a higher level of hearing loss. BERA, which is the test that provides clinching evidence, is available in most physiology and ENT departments in Delhi hospitals.","Aiims experts have found that senior doctors of lady hardinge medical college wrongly certified two hearing impaired neet-qualified students.

Audit warnings

A farmhand who moved out of his two-bedroom home so that 50 students who had nowhere to go after their school collapsed in the recent rains has become an unlikely hero in Piplodi, a village of mainly tribal inhabitants in the hills of Rajasthan.The roof of the primary school in Piplodi, Jhalawar district, had given way almost as soon as the clouds did, slabs of concrete collapsing onto the children beneath, killing seven of them and injuring 21. In that moment, on July 25, the only school in Piplodi ceased to exist.Heartbroken, Mor Singh, a 60-year-old farm labourer who never attended school himself, offered the only asset he had ever built - his small pucca house - to the education department so that classes could continue. ""Children shouldn't lose their future,"" was all Singh had to say.His decision came without ceremony. Singh didn't gather the village or approach the panchayat. He only told his family - eight members, including a two-year-old grandson - they would have to leave the house and live in a temporary hut on the edge of their farmland.No one argued. It didn't matter that he had spent four years constructing it painstakingly, between 2008 and 2012, saving what he could from daily wages and crop leftovers, buying materials in small lots while stretching every rupee.It cost him Rs 4 lakh and a lifetime of work. On July 27, Singh and his family moved into their new home - an unsteady shack of plastic and tarpaulin propped up hurriedly on a sloped patch of land that floods during monsoon.At night, the family burnt hay to keep away insects and snakes. The roof leaked. The toddler slept in a hammock fashioned from Singh's wife Mangi Bai's old, threadbare sari. They lived with two cots, a stove, a few utensils, and stowed away most of their belongings at a relative's house.""Two years until a new school building is ready,"" he said. ""We'll manage."" And just like that, within days of the school's collapse, classes resumed in his old house. Teachers began returning. Parents who had hesitated started sending their children. It wasn't ideal - space was tight- but it was enough.Among the first to return to studies was Manisha - her leg still bandaged. Her eight-year-old brother Kartik had died in the collapse. Their father, Harakchand, said she had reached the school just minutes after him. ""We were home when we heard it - a loud crash, then nothing,"" he recalled. ""By the time we reached, my boy was gone."" The building had shown cracks for weeks. Plaster had been falling. The roof had sagged. The warnings, residents said, had been raised more than once but ignored.""This village was invisible to them until the day seven children died,"" said Rahul Kumar, 21, whose sister Priyanka was among them. ""We had complained. The cracks were visible. But no one cared. Now they visit every day, scribbling who-knows-what in notebooks.""The Rajasthan govt has now declared Piplodi an 'Adarsh Gram' (model village), launching a redevelopment plan under the slogan 'Humara Sankalp - Piplodi ka Kayakalp, Hadse se Vikas Tak' (our commitment - Piplodi's transformation, from tragedy to development). A fund of Rs 1.8 crore has been sanctioned for infrastructure - a new school with a playground, along with roads, electricity, water supply, an anganwadi, a ration shop, and a health sub-centre. Families of the children who died were granted Rs 5 lakh in fixed deposits, Rs 1 lakh in cash, and given five goats and cattle sheds through the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme. District collector Ajay Singh Rathore said the administration is focused on support and rebuilding. He told TOI: ""It's our responsibility to ensure development reaches them now.""The district administration did something else. Last week, it awarded Singh a cheque of Rs 1 lakh for his extraordinary gesture. Asked what he did with the money, Singh said he used it to build a cattleshed on higher ground. ""The animals started falling sick from waterlogged grazing areas. A platform for the hut would have helped us more. But animals needed it first.""Mor Singh's house remains the only place in Piplodi where learning continues. He visits occasionally, sometimes just to stand outside and listen. But most days, he stays near the hut, tending to the cattle.In recent years, multiple reports have flagged the poor condition of school infrastructure across rural Rajasthan. A 2024 report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India highlighted that 38% of govt school buildings needed urgent repair.","The roof of the primary school in piplodi, jhalawar district, collapsed on july 25.

NEW DELHI: Rain-battered north India just experienced its wettest two-week period in at least the past 14 years, available IMD records since 2012 reveal. From Aug 22 to Sept 4, the region logged nearly 3x of normal rainfall, triggering extreme weather fury in nearly all parts of the region - including cloudbursts on the Vaishno Devi route in J&K, worst-in-decades floods in Punjab, the third highest recorded levels of the Yamuna in Delhi and widespread landslides in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.North India recorded 205.3mm of rain in these 14 days against a normal of 73.1mm, accounting for 35% of the region's usual quota for the entire four-month monsoon season. The intense spell has put the region on course to registering its wettest monsoon in 37 years since 1988.North India, a region meteorologically known as northwest India, has received 691.7mm of rain in the monsoon season (since June 1) so far, nearly 37% higher than normal. Even if the region gets normal rainfall for rest of the season, which ends on Sept 30, the total is likely to cross 750mm. That will put this season's rainfall as second-highest in north India in last 50 years, behind 813.5mm recorded in 1988 and ahead of 737mm logged in 1994.During the past two weeks of weather fury, the region's total monsoon rainfall surplus climbed steeply from 11.6% on Aug 22 to nearly 37% on Thursday. Across a large region such as north India, the mean daily rainfall to sustain such high levels for two weeks is rare. So, what caused this prolonged spell of intense rain?""This period saw a rare instance of back-to-back spells of two-system interactions, that is, a 'western disturbance' bringing moist wind flows from regions close to the Mediterranean Sea converging with monsoon winds from the east.The first such interaction took place from Aug 23 to 27, and then another one began on Aug 29 and is expected to last till Friday,"" said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, IMD chief.Such interactions are known to unleash very heavy rainfall and cloudbursts in the western Himalayan states, the most devastating example being Kedarnath deluge in June 2013. While such two-system convergences are uncommon in the peak monsoon period of July-Aug, back-to-back occurrences are extremely rare.Except for east UP, the two-week spell caused extreme rain in all sub-divisions of northwest India. Punjab was most heavily impacted, logging 388% surplus rain in the first week and 454% in the second. In the past week ending Sept 3, the subdivision of Haryana, Delhi and Chandigarh recorded 325% excess rainfall, Himachal Pradesh 314%, west Rajasthan 285%, J&K 240% and Uttarakhand 190%.","North india recorded 205.3mm of rain in these 14 days against a normal of 73.1mm.
