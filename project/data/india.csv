Rescue and relief efforts intensify

The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), fire brigade, police, and local volunteers are conducting ongoing rescue operations.

So far, 5-7 people have been rescued and admitted to nearby hospitals for treatment and observation.

Up to 10-15 people may still be trapped in the debris or underwater. Rescue teams are using specialized equipment to search submerged areas.

Maharashtra announces Rs 5 lakh aid for victims

Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis announced financial assistance of Rs 5 lakh each to the families of those who lost their lives.

In a post on X, CMO said the government will also bear the full cost of medical treatment for those injured in the incident.

Official response and monitoring

CM Fadnavis has been in constant contact with the divisional commissioner, district collector, police commissioner, and tehsildar.

He emphasized relief work is being accelerated and described the incident as a tragedy, extending condolences to the families of the deceased.

Authorities urged people to avoid speculation until more official information is available.

Cause and condition of bridge

The bridge was described as old and dilapidated, possibly contributing to its failure under the heavy crowd.

While no rain was reported at the time of collapse, preceding days of heavy rainfall had caused the river to be in spate, increasing water speed and volume.

Local impact and witness accounts

The collapse happened on a busy Sunday afternoon, increasing the number of affected individuals as the area is a favored spot for picnickers and tourists.

Locals played a role in rescuing some victims immediately after the incident before official teams arrived.

Search operations continue

Search and rescue teams are working late into the evening, combing the river downstream for missing persons.

NDRF teams have deployed equipment such as boats and diving gear to aid in underwater searches.

Safety and future measures

The incident has raised questions about the safety and maintenance of infrastructure in popular tourist spots.

Authorities are expected to conduct a thorough investigation into the cause of the collapse and will likely review other similar structures for safety compliance.

Bengaluru: When NEET 2025 emerged as one of the toughest editions in recent memory, many students were stumped in the exam hall. But despite the challenging paper, Karnataka produced several top rankers who shared their surprised reactions and the strategies they had employed in the preparation stage.Ruchir Gupta | Alpine Public School — AIR 22""It's my mother's dream that I become a doctor. Her parents are doctors, and I've seen for myself the service they do and the respect they command. For me, there's no other profession through which I can help people as much. I started preparing with Allen in class 11, but when I wrote the paper, all my hopes were shattered. It was so hard, I couldn't digest it wasn't going as planned. In the middle of the exam, I even thought of switching to engineering. .. The holidays afterwards were even more stressful than the preparation stage, and I ensured I was always engaged and didn't think too much about the exam. The rank of 22 was a big surprise,"" said Ruchir.Tejas Shailesh Ghotgalkar | Sri Chaithanya Techno School, Marathahalli — AIR 38Even though his parents were engineers, Tejas' interest always lay in medicine.""He likes to learn about the body, physiology, and he wants to do research on diseases, especially neuro-related ones that haven't yet found cures. It is a self-discovered interest. He used to watch a lot of series related to medicine while in school — both fictional and otherwise. His other interest is physics. He got through IIT Delhi's engineering physics programme. But his first choice was always medicine,"" said his father, Shailesh Ghotgalkar.Pranshu Jahagirdar | Bangalore International Academy — AIR 42""I want to lead a life with a purpose. At the end of my life, when I look back, I should have left a footprint in this world. When I started my preparation for NEET with Allen, I realised how difficult it is to crack the exam and understood I'd need intense preparation. I deactivated my social media accounts, barely went out with friends, and dedicated my time entirely to study. On exam day, the questions were so hard, but the stakes were so high. I almost went into a trance mode and started answering questions in the pattern we were taught to — minimising negative scores and maximising the marks,"" said Pranshu.Harini Sriram | Base PU College, Bannerghatta Road — AIR 72Medicine was always Harini's first interest, not engineering. ""I like the hectic and tight schedules doctors have instead of the regular working hours of an engineer. School, family, and friends were a big support system. Group discussions with friends helped as it made it easier to remember things. When the paper was tough, I tried not to panic, but I did. With that, time management became an issue. But I somehow managed, and the rank was unexpected,"" she said.Diganth S | Narayana NEET Academy Co Kuvempu Bhavan — AIR 80""I wanted to be a doctor as it is a direct way of touching people's lives. I prepared hard for the past two years. With the exam being difficult, I was expecting a rank below 200. I'm happy I could make it below 100,"" he said.Nidhi KG | Expert PU College, Mangaluru — AIR 84""Right from the start, I was aiming for a rank below 100. The paper was tough this time, but I gave it my best. For the past two years, I dedicated myself to my studies, staying focused on my goal. I hope to pursue MBBS at AIIMS Delhi or Bangalore Medical College. Outside academics, I find joy in yoga, painting, and art.

NHL insider says Sabres are now listening to trade offers for JJ Peterka

General manager Kevyn Adams isn’t rushing but can’t ignore the market





The Buffalo Sabres are heading into one of the most critical offseasons in recent memory, and winger JJ Peterka has suddenly found himself at the center of trade speculation. After missing the playoffs yet again, the Sabres are under immense pressure to reshape the roster—and Peterka could be one of the first major moves.The 22-year-old German forward had a breakout 2024–25 season, posting 27 goals and 41 assists across 77 games. His performance has drawn attention around the league, especially with Buffalo reportedly exploring trade offers in what could become a sign-and-trade deal.According to respected NHL insider Elliotte Friedman, the Sabres are “listening to trade offers for JJ Peterka.” While this doesn’t confirm a deal is imminent, it shows the team is at least open to the idea of moving on from one of its most productive young players.Peterka is a restricted free agent, meaning the Sabres still hold considerable control over his future. However, if contract negotiations stall, a trade could quickly become the preferred option—especially if it brings back key assets to help Buffalo finally return to playoff contention.Sabres GM Kevyn Adams has reportedly pushed back against the idea that Peterka is actively being shopped, but the interest from other teams is real.With Buffalo finishing 36-39-7 and near the bottom of the Atlantic Division, it’s clear a more aggressive roster overhaul is on the table.Peterka’s high upside makes him a valuable trade chip, and if the right offer comes in, Adams may have no choice but to consider it. A sign-and-trade could give the Sabres both cap flexibility and a meaningful return in players or picks.For now, it’s just talk—but in an offseason where Buffalo needs bold moves, JJ Peterka’s name won’t be disappearing from trade rumors anytime soon. Whether he stays or goes may set the tone for the Sabres’ rebuild and playoff hopes in 2026.Also Read: Shocking Hockey Canada sexual assault trial ends as judge’s verdict on disgraced NHL stars looms on July 24","The buffalo sabres are reportedly considering trading winger jj peterka.

Why Venice locals are protesting against Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez Wedding venue

Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding, set for June 24 in Venice, is facing a fierce backlash from local residents and activists. Demonstrators have unfurled banners across historic churches, including the San Giorgio Maggiore Church, with slogans like “No Space for Bezos”, signaling their frustration over the lavish event. The $10 million celebration, planned on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, has triggered protests over blocked streets, luxury hotel takeovers, and environmental concerns, threatening to disrupt the Floating City during its peak tourist season.One of the most striking acts of dissent saw a large banner unfurled from the bell tower of the historic San Giorgio Maggiore Church. The banner, featuring a bold red 'X' slashing through Bezos's name, sent a clear visual message across the lagoon, quickly garnering attention on social media platforms. Flyers with similar slogans, including ""No space for oligarchs, no space for Bezos,"" have also been plastered across the city.The protests stem from concerns that Bezos’ wedding, scheduled for June 24-26, is turning Venice into a “playground for the ultra-wealthy”, exacerbating issues of overtourism, restricted public access, and environmental strain. Activists claim that Bezos has reserved luxury hotels, water taxis, and even an entire island, limiting movement for locals during peak tourist season.Local activist group Laboratorio Occupato Morion , which describes itself as an ""anti-fascist, anti-capitalist, anti-racist, and trans-feminist political space,"" is leading the charge against the event. Alice Bazzoli, a spokesperson for the Laboratorio Occupato Morion, a local activist group, stated: ""Bezos thinks he can buy the entire city. We refuse to let Venice be held hostage by one of the richest men in the world.""Organisers emphasise that their actions are not a personal attack on Bezos and Sanchez, but rather a broader statement against the disruptive nature of such events in a city already grappling with immense pressure.The couple is likely to host their guests at Scuola Grande della Misericordia. Built in 1310, the historical building was originally one of Venice’s Seven Scuole Grandi, a site reserved for city’s elite. The venue consists of grand frescoes by Renaissance masters such as Tintoretto, Veronese, and Pellegrini, making it one of the most opulent locations in the city. The building, which has been repurposed for exhibitions and events, can accommodate up to 1,000 guests.The wedding, scheduled for the weekend of June 24, is expected to host Hollywood stars, business moguls, and political figures. Among the rumored guests are Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, and Eva Longoria.","Jeff bezos and lauren sanchez's wedding is facing a fierce backlash from local residents and activists.

Narrow escapes and miraculous timing

NEW DELH: A delayed take-off may have prevented a far greater tragedy on Thursday when an Air India Dreamliner crashed into the residential quarters and mess hall of BJ Medical College in Ahmedabad, killing at least four people on the ground — including three resident doctors and the pregnant wife of another.Flight AI171 to London Gatwick, carrying 241 people onboard, took off 29 minutes behind schedule.Minutes earlier, a large group of doctors had finished lunch at the mess hall, which was later struck by the aircraft’s tail section.The Boeing 787, which lost control shortly after departing from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport, disintegrated in mid-air and fell in three parts: the nose hit the Atulyam-11 residential quarters for undergraduate and postgraduate doctors, the midsection tore through a garden and road and the tail slammed into the mess building.The crash turned a quiet afternoon into chaos on the BJ Medical College campus in Meghaninagar. Resident doctors Aaryan Rajput, Manav Bhadoo, and Rakesh Deora were confirmed dead. Kajal Pradip Solanki, the pregnant wife of another doctor, also died in the incident. Another doctor, Jay Prakash Chaudhary, was reported missing as of Thursday evening.With more than 300 doctors present across the five-storey building that houses both residential quarters and the doctors’ mess, the death toll could have been much higher if the plane had crashed even a few minutes later.Dr Ramkrishna, who survived the crash, recounted the terrifying moment:“I was having lunch in the mess when a friend called to warn me about a plane flying unusually low. I stepped out — and then came a massive blast. There was intense heat, smoke, and panic. When it cleared, we saw the wreckage. We pulled out bodies — they were doctors, still in aprons.”The impact and ensuing fireball, fuelled by an estimated 1.25 lakh litres of jet fuel, caused widespread devastation across the premises.Junior Doctors’ Association president Dhaval Gameti narrowly escaped the tragedy.“I was upset in the morning because I couldn’t join my friends for lunch,” he said. “At 1:41pm, I got a call about smoke and assumed it was a small fire. I called Civil Hospital superintendent Rakesh Joshi for an ambulance. When we reached, Air India’s ambulances were already there — and the devastation was far worse than expected. We pulled out 21–22 students.”Intern Kushal Chauhan had just returned to his hostel after lunch. MBBS student Manthan had just started his two-wheeler when the plane crashed.“I tried to flee, but my friend who was riding pillion caught fire. He sustained burns but survived,” he said.“If the crash had happened just a few minutes later, many more doctors would have been in the mess. Most finish OPD around 2pm and come for lunch,” Chauhan added.Among the youngest victims was Akash Patni, 13, who ran a tea stall near the doctors’ quarters. He had taken up the job after losing his father during the Covid pandemic. His cousin Anil, who had gone home to fetch lunch for Akash, recalled:“I heard the blast and ran back. But there was nothing left — just pieces of him.”","Resident doctors, doctor’s pregnant wife among dead in ahmedabad crash. 13-year-old tea seller among victims of air india dreamliner crash.
