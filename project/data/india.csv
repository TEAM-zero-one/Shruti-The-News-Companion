SC pulls up MP high court: 'You invented a clause to deny bail',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-pulls-up-mp-high-court-you-invented-a-clause-to-deny-bail/articleshow/120397763.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday held that a convict should be granted bail if there is no chance of his or her appeal against conviction being heard in near future in high courts because of huge pendency of cases.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan frowned on MP HC's ruling that held that a plea for suspension of sentence could be allowed only when a convict has served half of the sentence awarded by a trial court.""We are surprised that the HC invented a new proposition of law that has no basis,"" SC said while quashing HC's order and granting bail to the convict who already spent nine months in jail. SC said HC should have applied the law as it exists and the petitioner should not have been forced to move it for relief.SC also said that his appeal was not likely to be heard soon in HC due to pendency of cases. The bench said that SC in 1999 ruled that suspension of sentence should be allowed in normal cases and only in exceptional cases bail plea should not be allowed.The apex court has been expressing its anguish over ""intellectual dishonesty"" by lower courts and high courts by denying bail to the accused in cases involving ordinary infractions despite apex court's various orders exhorting them to be liberal in granting bail when custody is not needed.It had said reluctance of courts to grant bail results in everybody approaching the apex court for bail, when 40% of cases which are normal in nature should have been decided in HCs and trial courts. The influx of such cases creates undue burden on SC and creates a huge task for it.

NEW DELHI: Protecting the interest of homebuyers, Supreme Court Thursday held that buyers staging a peaceful protest and holding banners at a public place against a realtor without using abusive language wouldn't amount to defamation, reports Amit Anand Choudhary.Observing that right to dissent in a legitimate and lawful manner is an integral part of the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression and that every individual must respect the right of others to dissent, the court quashed criminal defamation proceedings initiated against some homebuyers for holdinga protest against a builder in Mumbai.The case was lodged by the builder alleging that their action of holding banners against it amounts to defamation.""Right to protest peacefully without falling foul of the law is a corresponding right, which the consumers ought to possess just as the seller enjoys his right to commercial speech. Any attempt to portray them as criminal offences, when the necessary ingredients are not made out, would be a clear abuse of process and should be nipped in the bud,"" Justice K V Viswanathan, who penned the judgement on behalf of the bench also comprising a bench of Justice N Kotiswar Singh, said.SC noted the grievance raised in banner was with regard to civic issues they were facing including not forming society, problems of water, poor lift maintenance, seepage, plumbing issues etc and they used the caption ""we protest for our rights"".""At the outset, what strikes us is that there is no foul or intemperate language employed against the respondent. There is no reference to any expression like fraud, cheating, misappropriation etc. In mild language, certain issues, which the appellants perceived as their grievances have been aired,"" the court observed.SC said that no case was made out for criminal defamation which depends on the choice of words used and to constitute the offence of defamation there should be imputation concerning any person with intent to harm or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm the reputation of such person.""Language is the vehicle through which thoughts are conveyed. Had the appellants exceeded their privilege in erecting the banner? We do not think so. As set out earlier, all that the banner depicts is what they thought were their grievances against the respondent with whom they had a business relationship.

It coincides with the party's focus to empower district units, and the protests can be the vehicle to assess the enthusiasm of the new heads of the lower rungs of the organisation.Meanwhile, Congress announced Rahul Gandhi will be on a tour to US for a university interaction and public meetings.

Supreme Court's observation



Poll Do you support the Supreme Court's stance on maintaining the status of waqf properties during the hearing of the Waqf Amendment Act 2025? No, I oppose it. Yes, I support it.





What is waqf?







What is 'waqf by user'?

4.02 lakh 'waqf by user' properties across India



2025 amendment: A bone of contention



Waqf laws in India so far



1913 & 1923: Early laws validated and regulated Muslim endowments .

. 1954 & 1995: The Wakf Acts created State Waqf Boards and the Central Waqf Council.

2013: Major reforms by the UPA included formal recognition of waqf by user, stricter rules against property misuse, inclusion of women on waqf boards, and expanded lease rights.

2025: The NDA’s amendments aimed at tightening definitions, curbing misuse, and boosting transparency—sparking debate about historical erasure and administrative overreach.



Centre to submit response in 7 days: SC



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday resumed hearing petitions challenging the Waqf Amendment Act, with Solicitor General Tushar Mehta defending the legislation and citing public concern over vast areas being declared as Waqf land. The court granted 7 days to Centre to file a preliminary response.A day earlier, on Wednesday, the Court had questioned the Centre’s move to remove the concept of "" waqf by user "" from the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025, warning that the change could potentially erase the status of thousands of longstanding religious properties across India. The Centre, however, opposed the directive and sought a hearing.The top court's bench said, ""The properties declared by courts as waqfs should not be de-notified as waqfs, whether they are by waqf-by-user or waqf by deed, while the court is hearing the challenge to the Waqf Amendment Act 2025 .""The CJI-led bench asked the Centre how waqf properties established through uninterrupted religious or charitable use -- but lacking formal documents - would now be treated. “How will you register such waqfs by user? What documents will they have? It will lead to undoing something. Yes, there is some misuse. But there are genuine ones also,” the court observed, citing legal precedents that have so far recognised such waqfs.The court also questioned the exclusivity of waqf board membership, mentioning, “All members of the waqf boards and Central Waqf Council must be Muslims, except ex-officio members,” and asked whether Hindus would be allowed to participate in their own religious trusts, highlighting questions of parity in religious administration.A waqf is a permanent dedication of movable or immovable property by a Muslim for religious, pious, or charitable purposes recognised by Islamic law. It is typically managed by a 'mutawalli' (caretaker), and cannot be sold or transferred.'Waqf by user' refers to the practice where a property, such as a mosque, dargah, graveyard, or community kitchen, is treated as waqf not because of a formal written deed, but because it has been consistently and openly used for religious or charitable purposes over a long period.This concept was legally recognised through court rulings and codified in the Waqf Amendment Act, 2013, passed by the UPA government.It allowed properties to be recorded as waqf even in the absence of documentary proof, based on community usage and long-standing public acceptance.The idea was to protect heritage structures that predated modern land registration systems.Also read: In 10 big numbers - Waqf and its properties in India According to data available on the Waqf Assets Management System of India (WAMSI) portal, 30 states and Union territories along with 32 Boards have reported a total of 8.72 lakh Waqf properties, spanning over 38 lakh acres. Of these, 4.02 lakh properties are classified as ""waqf by user.""Waqf properties in India form one of the largest networks of religious and community-owned land globally, encompassing a diverse range of assets across the country.These include 1,50,516 graveyards (17%) and 1,19,200 mosques (14%). Commercial properties such as shops (1,13,187) and houses (92,505) contribute to the economic sustenance of the Waqf system. Additionally, 1,40,784 properties are agricultural land (16%), while religious sites like dargahs and mazars account for 33,492 properties.The Waqf Amendment Act, 2025, introduced by the NDA government, removed or majorly limited the concept of 'waqf by user'. It made documentary ownership a requirement, stating that only a ""practising Muslim for at least five years"" who is the legal owner of a property can declare it as waqf.The Centre argued that the 2013 law led to ""misuse and wrongful classification"" of lands -- including government or private property -- as waqf, often without valid proof.Critics, however, fear that the amendment could jeopardise ""centuries-old Islamic institutions"" that lack formal records but have served as religious spaces for generations.The 2025 law does offer some protection by stating that already ""registered"" waqf-by-user properties will remain so -- unless challenged or identified as government property . But concerns remain over thousands of sites that may be ""unregistered or under dispute"".India has a long legislative history concerning waqf, dating back to British rule:The Supreme Court resumed its hearing on Thursday, hearing petitions challenging Waqf Amendment Act. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta defended the legislation, citing widespread public concern over large areas being declared as Waqf land. He requested a week to file a preliminary response.The bench declined to stay the Act but stressed maintaining status quo during the hearing. It also recorded the Centre’s assurance that no appointments would be made to Waqf bodies in the meantime. The matter will be heard next week.","A waqf is a permanent dedication of movable or immovable property by a muslim for religious, pious, or charitable purposes recognised by islamic law. 'waqf by user' refers to the practice where a property, such as a mosque, dargah, graveyard, or community kitchen, is treated as waqf not because of a formal written deed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120371906,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-394186,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Bridge on the river Magai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bridge-on-the-river-magai/articleshow/120397018.cms,"The bridge, likely to be 105ft, has been designed by an ex-Army engineer

When there's a will, there's a way, they say. Residents of Kyampur Chhavni, a village in UP's Ghazipur district, say when there's a will, there's a bridge... not yet, but soon. Tired of waiting for authorities, these villagers have crowdfunded and pooled resources to begin building a bridge on a tiny river - the Magai - that has long stood between them and the rest of the world.The district administration says the villagers were impatient, that they should have waited. Residents say they have waited 58 years - long enough!The Magai is 70ft wide, and the lack of a bridge has had a huge effect on not just the 3,500-odd residents of Kyampur village, but more than 70,000 residents of around 50 villages on either side of the river, who have had to take a 40km detour to cover a distance of less than 10km to reach the district headquarters.Villagers have tried crossing the river to reach Nonahara market, 3km from district hospital and headquarters, but there have been accidents in the past.Things began to look up in June 2022, when the then gram pradhan, Shashi Kala Upadhyay and Kasimabad block pramukh Manoj Gupta started work on an embankment along the river with provisions for a vehicular bridge. But just as villagers started to get hopeful, the project, undertaken under MGNREGS, encountered ""administrative hurdles"".In Jan 2024, Ravindra Yadav, a civil engineer with 55 Engineer Regiment of India Army's Corps of Engineers, came to live in his ancestral house in Kyampur after retirement. ""I served in the Army for three decades and helped build bridges across the country, particularly in remote areas of Nagaland and Manipur,"" says Ravindra, who also served in Border Roads Organisation. ""After retiring, I was disheartened to discover my village still lacking direct connectivity with the district headquarters. I decided to build a bridge, and fortunately received support from villagers and influential individuals, including architects and bridge engineers I met during my service.""Ravindra gave Rs 10 lakh from his retirement funds and offered technical expertise to help build the bridge.""This gesture galvanised local sentiment and gave confidence to locals,"" says Ravindra's elder brother, Kalika.""People chipped in with whatever they could,"" says Ram Naresh Rajbhar, a village elder. ""Contributions as little as Rs 100 were made. Those who had no money offered help in kind - cement, sand, steel rebars and labour, after finishing their regular jobs.""Ravindra readied the design for a 105ft bridge across the river, and the project was ready to be reborn.The ground-breaking ceremony was on Feb 25, 2024. Present at the event was Allahabad HC's Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav. In his short speech, the judge praised the grit and spirit of local residents.""So far, apart from constructing retaining walls on both banks, four pillars have been erected,"" says Kalika, who is account-keeper. ""Slabbing is in progress. We have spent around Rs 65 lakh, and need Rs 30 lakh more to complete girder and slab work and to build a slope up to the approach road.""The villagers' efforts were also noticed by Mohammadabad MLA Suhaib Ansari, who donated Rs 1 lakh and high-mast lights to illuminate the construction site for late-night work.Ansari says when his father, Sibgatullah Ansari was MLA between 2012 and 2017, he had forwarded the bridge construction file to state govt, and upon becoming MLA himself in 2022, Ansari raised the issue in his inaugural speech, requesting immediate funds. .The villagers, however, aren't convinced. They blame their plight on a lack of political will.""Since 1967, villagers have been demanding a bridge on the Magai from public representatives,"" says Kalika. ""Before every election, they used to send junior engineers or other officials with measurement machines. After being voted to office, all promises were forgotten,"" Kalika added.The district administration has also taken note of the under-construction bridge. ""Experts from PWD and UP Bridge Corporation are checking the structures built by the villagers for quality and load-bearing standards,"" says DM Aryka Akhauri. She says the villagers have been asked to halt work until the checks are over. This is important for public safety, she adds, because experts were not involved in the construction, nor were permissions sought for the work.But villagers are not waiting any longer. As dusk descends, they get ready with spades, shovels and a whole lot of resolve - there's a bridge to be built, after all.","Kyampur chhavni, a village in up's ghazipur district, has waited 58 years for a bridge. More than 70,000 residents of around 50 villages on either side of the river have had to take a 40km detour to cover a distance of less than 10km.

INDORE: Praising CRPF for crushing left-wing extremists' dream of creating a 'red' terror corridor from Pashupatinath to Tirupati and confining them to just four districts, Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday said the force, particularly its CoBRA battalion , will play the lead role in making the country Naxalism-free by March 2026.Speaking at an event in Neemuch on the 86th Raising Day of CRPF, Shah lauded CoBRA commandos for their 'unprecedented' work in making the country Naxal-free. ""Whether it is fighting terrorists in the Kashmir valley, establishing peace in the northeast, or crushing hardened Naxalites, CRPF jawans have made a huge contribution in all operations.""Central armed forces - especially CRPF's CoBRA battalion - are the spearheads in the battle to smash Naxalism , he said. ""CRPF has set up over 400 forward operating bases in Naxal areas, because of which violence has dropped by more than 70% in these regions. Now, we are close to ending it completely,"" Shah said.Describing the CoBRA batallion as a 'symbol of valour', Shah said: ""Today, even the most dreaded Naxalites tremble when they hear that CoBRA commandos are approaching.""Singh announced CRPF would be raising a special CoBRA battalion for counter-terrorist operations in Jammu and Kashmir.

NEW DELHI/NASHIK: Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered a stay on Nashik Municipal Corporation 's April 1 demolition notice to the Hazrat Saatpeer Sayed Baba dargah in Nashik city, but the structure was razed by a civic squad hours before the court hearing amid violence by a mob that left 21 policemen injured.Any plea against demolition is usually given urgent hearing as delay could cause irreversible damage. However, Bombay HC did not list one such plea against demolition of the dargah after a petition was filed on April 7, according to the senior lawyer representing the dargah.The apex court has sought a report from the HC's registrar general after the lawyer submitted that the petitioner had been waiting since April 8 but the ""high court has declined to list the matter ever since"".The civic body's action against the dargah at Kathe Galli in Nashik was carried out between Tuesday midnight and 6am Wednesday.The dargah's SLP against the HC's denial of listing of the matter came up before the SC later on Wednesday, but there was no mention of the dargah having already been demolished.",Supreme court on wednesday ordered a stay on nashik municipal corporation's april 1 demolition notice to the hazrat saatpeer sayed baba dargah in nashik city.

No SC stay as govt puts key waqf law provisions on hold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-sc-stay-as-govt-puts-key-waqf-law-provisions-on-hold/articleshow/120395153.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Union govt Thursday pre-empted a looming stay on certain contentious provisions of the recently enacted Waqf (Amendment) Act by assuring Supreme Court that it will make no appointments to the Central Waqf Council and Auqaf Boards and maintain status quo on waqf properties , including 'waqf by user', already registered or declared under the Waqf Act, 1995.Accepting solicitor general Tushar Mehta's assurance and refraining from ordering interim stay on certain provisions of the Act, a bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justices Sanjay Kumar and K V Viswanathan asked the Centre, states and all waqf boards to file their responses to the 150-odd petitions within seven days.The SG's assurance came after the CJI observed, ""We had said there were some positive things in the law. We have also stated that there cannot be a complete stay. At the same time, we also don't want the situation to change from what is prevailing now."" The CJI flagged the 'waqf by user' provision and the stipulation that a person had to be practising Islam for five years to be eligible to be a waqif but did not elaborate further.The court asked the petitioners, who have challenged the constitutional validity of the changes made to the Waqf Act, 1995, on the ground that these violated Muslims' fundamental right to religion, to file rejoinders in five days after the Centre, states and waqf boards file their responses. It posted further hearing on May 5. As CJI Khanna retires on May 13, it is to be seen whether he will hear the petitions or assign these to another bench.Since the Central Waqf Council has been defunct for the last three years, the assurances made by Mehta not to make any appointment to the council appears to be of little consequence to the Union govt.T he petitioners have questioned the provision for nomination of two non-Muslims to the council and boards as interference in the Muslim community’s fundamental right under Article 26.The Solicitor General clarified that if states nominate members to Auqaf Boards, most of which are continuing as their remaining tenure is protected by the Act, in the next two weeks when SC is seized of the matter, it would be termed void.The assurance to preserve the sanctity of waqfs and ‘waqfs by user’ already registered or notified under the Waqf Act, 1995, is part of the amended Act, which says, “… existing ‘waqf by user’ properties registered on or before the commencement of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, as ‘waqf by user’ will remain as waqf properties except that the property, wholly or in part, is in dispute or is a government property”.What the assurance means is that govt may not reopen ‘waqf by user’ properties, which have been registered prior to the amended Act, even if there is a dispute about the property being govt land. This was one of the major concerns of the petitioners who said the validity of old waqf properties could be reopened by creating a dispute about these being govt properties. This would also mean that undeclared or unregistered waqf properties, including those through ‘waqf by user’, could be subject to scrutiny to identify legitimacy of ownership and whether it was govt land.When the hearing started, the SG said it would be harsh if the court was considering staying some provisions of the Act on taking a prima facie view without a detailed scrutiny of the history of the 1995 Waqf Act from its inception in 1923, joint parliamentary committee deliberations and its report as well as the object behind enactment of the amendment by Parliament.Mehta said govt was answerable to the people and Parliament and pointed out that village after village had been declared waqf property, resulting in thousands of people losing their land. This had weighed with the govt while introducing the bill to amend the Waqf Act, he said, adding that the court must be alive to the fallout of its decision.Given the difficulties in managing the hearing when there was a constant inflow of fresh petitions that resulted in engaging of a greater number of advocates, CJI Khanna said the petitioners must select five petitions as the lead ones and a nodal counsel to coordinate.Rest of the petitions would either be regarded as applications or disposed of and the case list would not be in any individual or organisation’s name but be shown as ‘In Re: Waqf (Amendment) Act’, he suggested.The CJI-led bench was overwhelmed by a courtroom packed with counsel representing over 150 petitioners and many unable to enter the courtroom because of overcrowding. Live webcast of proceedings in the case remained elusive for many lawyers and journalists as it reached maximum capacity much before commencement of hearing at 2pm.On earlier occasions, the SC used to resort to live telecast through its own YouTube channel but, surprisingly, for this nationally important case, the same procedure was not adopted and officials expressed inability to accommodate lawyers and journalists.","Supreme court asked centre, states and all waqf boards to file their responses to the 150-odd petitions within seven days.

DEHRADUN: In a strongly worded judgment, Uttarakhand HC directed B R Ambedkar Inter College, Dehradun, to immediately disburse all pending salaries to its teaching and non-teaching staff, who have remained unpaid for the past three years. Terming the delay ""inhumane"", the court remarked, ""Teachers are human beings... they have a belly. They need to eat too."" The directive followed revelations that despite providing continued service, the college staff did not receive salaries due to the state govt's decision to withhold grants.The institute was denied grant-in-aid status in 2015 on the grounds that it was newly established even though it had consistently demonstrated strong academic performance. Highlighting the school's academic record, the court pointed out that all 294 students who appeared in the 2021 board examinations passed, with 93 securing first division. The school maintained commendable results in 2022 and 2024, achieving an 82.7% pass rate in the most recent academic session. HC noted that the recruitment process had been properly conducted and that staff had diligently fulfilled their duties. However, the education department stalled appointments and withheld grant approval due to alleged irregularities, eventually blacklisting the institution.In 2022, the director of education ordered the cancellation of all appointments made after Oct 25, 2016. HC later stayed this order, observing that the affected teachers were discharging their duties sincerely and that such administrative actions could not justify withholding their rightful salaries.On Wednesday, HC said ""mere procedural lapses in recruitment cannot be grounds to deny salaries to staff who've been working in students' interest"".","B r ambedkar inter college, dehradun, was denied grant-in-aid status in 2015.

"Bill Aitken, recorder of India's terrain & trains, dies at 90",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bill-aitken-recorder-of-indias-terrain-trains-dies-at-90/articleshow/120394304.cms,"Bill Aitken

MUSSOORIE: Bill Aitken , the Scottish-born writer who spent more than six decades mapping India's spiritual and geographical life through a body of work that rarely strayed into the abstract, died in Dehradun on Wednesday night. He was 90. Aitken had sustained injuries from a fall at his home in Mussoorie last week and was admitted to hospital in critical condition. In accordance with his wishes, he was cremated near the Ganga in Haridwar on Thursday.Born in 1934 in Tullibody, a small town in Clackmannanshire, Scotland, Aitken came to India in 1959 after completing a Master's degree in comparative religion at the University of Leeds. He arrived not by plane but overland - hitchhiking through Europe, Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, a route that later became the 'Hippy Trail' for young westerners on spiritual sojourn to the east - carrying with him a curiosity that would later permeate all his writing.Aitken taught briefly at Hindi High School in Kolkata before retreating into the Himalayas , where he lived in the ashrams of Kausani & Mirtola in Kumaon for over a decade. These early years in Uttarakhand, then part of UP, shaped his worldview and the quiet, observational quality that would come to define his work.In 1960s, Aitken moved to Mussoorie, serving as companion and confidant to Prithwi Bir Kaur, the widow maharani of the former Sikh princely state of Jind. In 1972, he became a naturalised Indian citizen. Oakless, the quaint house where he lived for several years along with his pet dogs, remained his homestead till the end. Even though he preferred to lead a restrained - some would say reclusive - life, he warmly welcomed those who sought him out, whether curious locals, or fawning fans. His quintessential Scottish humour ensured that those who met him often returned with a smile.Aitken's literary output spanned spiritual geography , railways, mountain culture, and long-distance travel. His most recognised titles include 'Seven Sacred Rivers', 'Footloose in the Himalaya', 'The Nanda Devi Affair', 'Zanskar: The Hidden Kingdom', and 'Divining the Deccan'. He was not a writer given to sweeping rhetorical flourishes; instead, his sentences unfurled with the deliberateness of someone used to moving through terrain on foot or two wheels. He was, for years, a familiar figure along India's less-travelled roads, travelling by motorcycle, rail, or simply on foot.His relationship with Indian Railways bordered on the archival. Aitken served as president of the Friends of the National Rail Museum in New Delhi and as honorary librarian of the Himalayan Club. In books like 'Exploring Indian Railways' and 'Branch Line to Eternity', he traced not just the routes and locomotives but the sensory experience of train travel - its silences, its halts, and the forgotten dignity of branch lines.Though often classified under travel, Aitken's books were, in spirit, records of residence - documents of immersion, not movement. Even though he had stopped writing for a while, budding writers in the town often sought him out, and he would often entertain their requests for a foreword.Incidentally, Aitken spoke fluent Hindi and Garhwali, which allowed him to blend into environments where outsiders stood out. His last book, 'Sri Sathya Sai Baba - A Life', in 2004, was a reflective biography of the spiritual leader he followed but never idolised.Sunil Arora of Cambridge Book Depot in Mussoorie, where Aitken's books have long held a quiet prominence on the travel shelf, recalled the writer's understated ritual of autographing books with handwritten phrases in Hindi: 'Jai Himalaya' for 'The Nanda Devi Affair' and 'Jai Ganga Maiya' for 'Seven Sacred Rivers'. ""He didn't sign often,"" Arora said, ""but when he did, he always did it with intent.""Ganesh Saili, a fellow writer and longtime resident of Mussoorie, said Aitken's death marked the departure of a kind of chronicler India rarely produces - one who stayed, listened, and wrote without spectacle. ""It is an immense loss to the diminishing number of writers community in Mussoorie,"" Saili said. ""We are deeply saddened.""","Aitken came to india in 1959 after completing a master's degree in comparative religion at the university of leeds. His most recognised titles include 'seven sacred rivers', 'footloose in the himalaya', 'the nanda devi affair', 'zanskar: the hidden kingdom', and 'divining the deccan' he was cremated near the ganga in haridwar on thursday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120395055,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-33422,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
