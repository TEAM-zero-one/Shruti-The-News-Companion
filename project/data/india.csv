JAMMU: Border-related challenges had changed significantly over the past 60 years, and therefore advanced technological solutions must be adopted to effectively address them, Union home minister Amit Shah said Friday as he visited the Gurnam and Bobiyan outposts located along the India-Pakistan International Border in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir Later in the evening, Shah chaired a high-level security review meeting in Jammu at Lok Bhavan, which was attended by LG Manoj Sinha, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi, Union home secretary, IB director, J&K chief secretary and DGP, heads of CAPFs and other senior officers.At the meeting, while the home minister appreciated the efforts of the security agencies in dismantling the terror ecosystem, he directed them to remain alert and continue work in a coordinated mode to ensure that the gains made in recent times are sustained and the goal of a ‘terror free J&K’ is achieved at the earliest. He assured that all the resources would be made available by the govt to achieve this.Shah said the terror eco-system nurtured by elements inimical to the country in J&K had been almost crippled due to the concerted efforts of the Narendra Modi govt. Efforts for de-radicalisation had seen major success, he said, and instructed for taking more initiatives for youth engagement. Innovative measures to further reinforce the watertight security cordon were also discussed in the meeting.This was the second security review meeting chaired by the Union home minister within a month. On Jan 8, he had chaired a high-level review meeting in Delhi on J&K’s security situation.Earlier in the day, the home minister, addressing BSF personnel at the border posts in the sensitive Hiranagar sector, said while courage, alertness and dedication of personnel remained crucial, many emerging challenges were now technology-driven. “The govt will invest substantial funds to modernise the entire border security system based on technology. This modernisation will provide improved border infrastructure and advanced equipment for BSF personnel, enabling them to perform their duties more effectively,” he said.Lauding the border guarding troops, Shah said whenever the country’s borders had faced threats of intrusion or infiltration, BSF had stood like an impregnable wall, resolute in its commitment to safeguarding the nation. “The bravery and valour displayed by BSF during Operation Sindoor have added a golden chapter to its six-decade-long history,” he added.The home minister commended the sacrifices of BSF sub-inspector Mohammed Imteyaz and constable Deepak Chingakham in Pakistani firing during Operation Sindoor.Under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, the Govt of India was fully committed to the welfare of security personnel, the minister said, and announced that a special welfare scheme for BSF personnel will be introduced soon. He also appreciated the significant contribution of BSF women personnel towards border security. He later had lunch with the soldiers.","Amit shah outlines foolproof nidms mechanism to counter future terror attacks.

"Studies vs gaming: Strike a balance, PM Modi tells students",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/studies-vs-gaming-strike-a-balance-pm-modi-tells-students/articleshow/128015124.cms,"From Exam Stress to Life Skills: PM Modi Engages Students in Pariksha Pe Charcha 2026

NEW DELHI: From marks anxiety to gaming ambitions, PM Modi used Pariksha Pe Charcha 2026 to tell students not to believe life was a single-subject exam. Whether the debate is between ""skills vs marks"" or ""studies vs gaming"", balance, discipline and purpose will always hold them in good stead.Responding to students torn between competing advice, Modi said: ""There should be balance in everything."" He explained that skills are not one category. ""There are two types of skills - life skills and professional skills,"" he said, adding: ""Education and skills are twin siblings. They are not separate.""Modi underlined that knowledge matters, but practice turns learning into capability. ""Books impart knowledge, but only practice makes you professionally skilled,"" he said, telling students that real expertise is built through doing - whether in medicine, law, robotics or any other field.When a student spoke about building a future in gaming despite social criticism, Modi encouraged treating it as a skill - not a distraction. Parents may scold at first, he said, but success changes the script: ""Your success becomes their honour."" He suggested creating games rooted in Indian stories like Panchatantra and using social media to get feedback and improve.But he drew a red line on gambling. Gaming for betting or mindless timepass, he warned, is destructive.Gaming as a skill, however, builds speed, alertness and creativity - and should be honed with quality work.The Prime Minister also pushed collaborative learning as a practical way to improve. ""Collaborative learning helps everyone improve,"" Modi said, asking students to teach classmates who struggle and also spend time with those who are sharper to cross-check their own understanding. It brings ""double benefit"", he said - better clarity and new ideas.On the common class XII dilemma - board exams plus competitive tests - Modi acknowledged students' stress and compared it to trying to play cricket and football at the same time. His advice was clear: ""You'll have to give first priority to 12th."" If a student truly absorbs the school syllabus, he said, competitive exams will follow naturally as a by-product. He also nudged parents to ease pressure and trust their child's pace, advising them to ""allow children to blossom according to their capacity, ability and interest.

Modi cautions students against shortcut learning

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday urged students not to view success in exams as the sole purpose of their education and said an individual's character and temperament, and not just grades, determine success in life.""Education is not only for exams but for life. Exams are meant to examine oneself,"" Modi said at his annual 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' interaction, aimed at helping students cope with exam pressure, adding that the ultimate goal is not marks but the holistic development of life.Modi said he believes in focusing on future goals instead of obsessing about what has happened. ""A leader told me, you have turned 75. I replied, 25 are still left. I don't count what has passed. I count what is left,"" he said. His advice to students was: ""Don't waste time counting what's passed. Think about living what lies ahead.""Warning against shortcut learning, Modi said many students, fixated with good scores, suffer because they focus only on what patterns can be discerned in questions in previous exams. Good teachers, he said, do the opposite - ""They teach the entire syllabus and explain how it connects to life.""Using a cricket analogy, he noted that a player cannot succeed by strengthening just one muscle. In the same way, students must build mind, body and understanding together, the PM said.Modi reminded students that board toppers are soon forgotten, but character and capability last. ""Instead of tying your mind to marks, keep testing where your life is heading,"" he said. ""Aim for the best possible life - and treat education as one important path to reach there,"" Modi said.Modi welcomed students at 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' with the Assamese gamosa, calling it his ""most cherished"" symbol of the Northeast and women's empowerment - a traditional wear that BJP had accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of declining to wear at the Republic Day 'At Home' reception hosted by President Droupadi Murmu. The party accused the leader of opposition of insulting the sentiments of people of AssamStudents also wrote their fears on a blackboard which Modi read aloud and addressed one by one. On confidence, he said: ""Real confidence comes from inner truth."" On life choices, he added: ""Comfort zones don't shape life - your way of living does."" Urging students to dream, Modi said, ""Not having a dream is a crime."" But, he added, dreaming alone is not enough without action. He advised students to write down their goals, keep them private, and work step by step. Reading biographies, he said, helps young people see how great leaders also started small like A P J Abdul Kalam.","Pm narendra modi urges students not to view success in exams as the sole purpose of their education.

GHAZIABAD: As police intensify their investigation into the deaths of three sisters in Ghaziabad, their father, Chetan Kumar, has acknowledged being under financial stress but denied that it played any role in the alleged suicides.“I had a loan of Rs 30 lakh, but this was not the reason behind my three daughters’ death.

One can understand if someone takes such an extreme step owing to depression. But how could all three sisters do this together?"" said Isha Tyagi, a resident of the society.Investigators said the girls’ father, Chetan Kumar, had married twice and had five children — four daughters and a son. Both wives are sisters, according to news agency PTI, and the entire family lived together.She said she had rarely seen the girls interacting with other children. According to her, they were never seen going to school or playing in the society park, and their isolation had gone largely unnoticed for years.Police said preliminary findings suggest the sisters were heavily influenced by Korean content, particularly a Korean game, and spent a substantial amount of time on their mobile phones.Deputy commissioner of police Nimish Patil said the girls’ schooling had been irregular and their academic performance below average. “But it is evident that the girls were highly addicted to mobile phone usage,” he said.Neighbours said the family had lived in the society for about three years but mostly kept to themselves.Rahul Kumar Jha, the joint secretary of the residential society, said he had occasionally seen the girls attending tuition classes but was unaware of their formal schooling.Also read: Inside the troubled Ghaziabad home: Two marriages, wives leaving, no schooling for kids, mounting debts and a family under strain “They spent most of their time confined to a single room.

Some read: “make me a heart broken”, “I am very very alone” and “my life is very very alone”, police said.Jyoti Kasana, another resident, said children of that age were particularly vulnerable. “Children at this age are vulnerable. Even sudden actions like taking away a phone or tablet can deeply affect their mental state,” she said.Ajay Kasana, vice-president of the society, said the girls had not been attending school since the pandemic.Police also recovered a note believed to have been left by the sisters. It read: “Read everything written in this diary, it is all here ” and included a crying face emoji, followed by a handwritten message: “Sorry papa, I am really sorry.”Authorities said the investigation is ongoing and statements from residents are being recorded.","'sorry papa': suicide note from three sisters in ghaziabad triggers debate on gaming addiction.

Following his arrest by Patna Police in connection with a 1995 case, Purnea MP Pappu Yadav said he was unsure about what lay ahead or where he was being taken. The arrest came after high drama at his Patna residence, where police arrived to take him into custody.Speaking to reporters, Yadav said he was unwell and expressed fears over his safety. “I am not well... I don't know what will happen with me,” he said.Ahead of the arrest, Yadav told ANI that he feared the police might harm him and insisted that he wanted to be taken directly to court instead of a police station. He said the court had summoned him the next day and suggested that house arrest could have been considered. He also questioned the police for arriving in civil clothes, saying he initially thought they had come to kill him. Referring to the case, he noted that it was registered nearly 35 years ago and questioned the need for his arrest at this stage.“I have doubt that these people might have killed me. I will go straight to the Court. I will not go to the police station. If they want, they can house arrest me. The Court has called me. Police reached here in civil uniform like criminals.

'Can't be compelled': SC allows termination of minor's 30-wk fetus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/minor-has-right-over-reproductive-choice-supreme-court/articleshow/128008025.cms,"Minor has right over reproductive choice: Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: It was difficult for Supreme Court to decide - protect the interests of a 30-week pregnant minor girl who did not want an illegitimate child and seek termination of pregnancy or save the unborn child who, as a 30-week fetus, has a beating heart. But the scale of justice tilted in favour of the girl and SC allowed termination of pregnancy, saying she can't be compelled to give birth to a child.Finding itself in the tricky situation as it was asked to prioritise the competing interests, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan admitted it was not easy for it to decide the case. The court finally allowed the plea of the pregnant girl's mother.NEW DELHI: A minor's mother sought Supreme Court's permission for termination of her daughter's pregnancy, taking into consideration that the child would be illegitimate and the girl had to live her life with mental trauma and social stigma. The court said the girl has a right over her reproductive autonomy.The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 allows abortion up to 20 weeks based on the opinion of one registered medical practitioner, and up to 24 weeks for specific categories of women (including rape survivors and minors) with the opinion of two doctors.Contending that she did not want to give birth to the child, the petitioner sought abortion on the grounds that continuing with pregnancy and giving birth would cause her trauma.Maharashtra govt however, told the court that the fetus at 30 weeks had a beating heart and termination at this stage would result in premature birth of a child who would face the risk of abnormality. The lawyer for the state, Devanshi Singh, contended that the baby could be handed over to an orphanage.The bench asked the state whose interests it was trying to protect. The lawyer responded that it was for the court to take a call. She also brought to the notice of the bench an earlier order passed by SC in 2017, when termination of more than 30 weeks pregnancy was allowed as the girl was only 13 and a rape survivor.Considering the totality of the situation, the court passed the order in favour of the girl but said that termination of pregnancy should not result in feticide. ""It is an illegitimate child. We don't want to comment on the relationship. They cannot get married and she has to carry the stigma for the rest of her life. We have to consider her mental aspect. Can the court ask her to continue with the pregnancy and deliver the child? If we do, then people would not come to court to seek permission and they would go to quack and illegal centres for abortion and life and health would be put at risk,"" the bench said.""Whose interest would prevail is the question. It is very difficult to decide,"" the SC bench said.With any delay likely to complicate the situation further, the bench directed termination of pregnancy. ""We direct the JJ Group of Hospitals, Mumbai, to conduct the procedure of medical termination of pregnancy of the daughter of the appellant herein by bearing in mind all medical safeguards,"" the bench said.The mother had moved SC, through lawyer Shantanu Adkar, after her plea was rejected by Bombay HC, which had held that a forced termination would amount to feticide as the ""fetus is healthy and viable"". It had directed that the teen be provided comprehensive medical and psychological support until her delivery and the child be given away to a registered orphanage.According to the petition, the pregnancy was the result of the girl's relationship with a friend. The mother alleged that the friend had forced the girl into a physical relationship after promising to marry her and FIR had been filed against him.","Minor has right over reproductive choice: supreme court.

‘Nitish Still X-Factor’ Pavan Verma Decodes Why Jan Suraaj Couldn’t Break Through in Bihar Polls

NEW DELHI: Prashant Kishor-headed Jan Suraaj Party on Friday was criticised by the Supreme Court for filing a writ petition seeking annulment of recently concluded Bihar assembly elections on the ground that the poll-eve Rs 10,000 dole to women was a corrupt practice that altered the level-playing field.""How many votes did your party get? People rejected you in the elections. Now you want to use the judicial platform to garner popularity,"" said a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi. JSP contested 238 seats and failed to win a single seat mustering a poor 3.4% of the votes. The party got less votes than NOTA in 68 constituencies.JSP's counsel C U Singh said that the distribution of Rs 10,000 under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojna, amounting to a total of Rs 15,600 crore, during the period when the model code of conduct for election was in force amounted to corrupt practice. Terming the doles as freebies, Singh said Bihar is one of the top five fiscal deficit states, and spending such a huge amount from exchequer without economic planning would further impact its financial health.The SC bench said, ""There is a difference between legal and constitutional questions and fiscal policy. If a governing political party is causing harm to the state through its economic policy, then it is for the people to vote it out.We cannot entertain such petitions. It is an omnibus election petition seeking to annul the entire election.""""You file an election petition for each constituency and prove that because of the corrupt practice the candidate has won. Otherwise, if a candidate has won by a margin of 10,000 votes and there were only 1,000 women who got the dole, why should his election be set aside,"" the bench asked.When the counsel continued to persuade the court to examine the legality and constitutionality of election-eve freebies, the bench said it would seriously examine the issue in the pending petitions but not at the instance of a political party which lost the election badly. ""All political parties indulge in the same freebies game once they come to power,"" the bench said.""Why did you not challenge it when the announcement was made about giving Rs 10,000 to each woman in Bihar by the govt,"" the SC bench said.It told the party to move Patna high court. ""You withdraw the petition and file a petition in the HC. We will have the benefit of HC's view,"" the bench said.

Not only that, 2,677 or about 85% of seats in clinical specialties bagged by those with scores below the initial cut-off were in private medical colleges as well. In comparison, only 485 clinical specialty seats in govt colleges were filled by those with scores below the initial cut-off.Tuition fees are highest for clinical specialties in private colleges.General category candidates benefited the most from the cut-off reduction as they accounted for over 56% of those admitted with scores below the first cut-off. OBCs accounted for 26%, and SC and ST candidates 11% and 6%, respectively.

SRINAGAR/JAMMU: J&K CM Omar Abdullah presented on Friday the National Conference (NC) govt’s second budget, peppered with references to challenges arising out of last year’s Pahalgam attack, Operation Sindoor and devastating floods.Presenting the Rs 1.27-lakh crore budget for 2026-27 as he also handles finance, Omar proposed two dedicated emergency hospitals and bullet-proof ambulances in frontier areas prone to shelling, cross-border attacks and natural disasters. One hospital will come up in Uri and the other in Poonch. Both had borne the brunt of Pakistani shelling during Operation Sindoor.“...In J&K, just as our economy was consolidating with renewed vigour, the barbaric terrorist attack at Pahalgam and its aftermath shocked us.

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Tuesday launched a sharp attack on Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma over his controversial remarks on ""troubling Miya Muslims"", calling them unconstitutional and divisive.Owaisi mocked the chief minister, saying, ""I want to give you Rs 2 as alms,"" and accused him of reducing constitutional governance to prejudice and intimidation. In a lengthy response, Owaisi said India's Constitution guarantees equality and non-discrimination, regardless of religion or community. ""The Constitution says all are equal. No discrimination should be done, whether it is a chief minister or anyone else,"" he said.Owaisi alleged that Bengali-speaking Muslims in Assam were being scapegoated for issues ranging from migration to rising prices. ""If vegetable prices increase in Assam, Miya Muslims are blamed. If someone wants to vote, they are told to go to Bangladesh,"" he said, adding that such rhetoric amounted to targeting a community for political gain.The AIMIM leader's remarks came after Sarma made statements encouraging action against ""Miya Muslims"" in Assam.Sarma said, ""Trouble the Miya Muslims by any means. If they face trouble, they will go from Assam ... We are directly against the Miya Muslims. We are not hiding anything.""The comments triggered a political storm in the election-bound northeastern state, with opposition parties accusing the BJP of resorting to communal polarisation to consolidate votes.The BJP, however, has long maintained that its focus in Assam is on addressing illegal immigration and protecting indigenous rights.

Weeks After Noida Techie's Death, Delhi Biker Dies After Falling Into Pit Dug By Jal Board

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Delhi President Saurabh Bhardwaj on Friday strongly criticised the Delhi Police and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Delhi government following the tragic death of 25-year-old Kamal Dhyin Janakpuri, alleging police negligence and deliberate attempts to withhold crucial information.Speaking to ANI, Bhardwaj described the incident as a reflection of the government's and police's ""shamelessness.""""What happened in Janakpuri has exposed the BJP government in Delhi, the Delhi Police Commissioner, and the entire Delhi Police... Today, a 25-year-old youth has died... Serious allegations have been slapped on the police. Around 12 am, the family went to the police station in search of their son... Not just one, but they went to six police stations, yet no one filed their report. Their children's phone location was deliberately deleted in haste. Why did they do this? What is the police trying to hide? When the boy's phone was on, the police had his location. If they wanted to, they could have found him. Maybe he might have been saved, but no one saved him. In the morning, Ashish Sood went there and lied about having proper arrangements.If there were proper arrangements, then did that boy jump to take his own life? This is simply the shamelessness of the government and the police, who are falsifying data. Today, with concrete evidence, this has been exposed to the entire country,"" he told ANI.Bhardwaj visited the accident site to assess the situation and pointed out alleged tampering with the scene.""This is the crime scene... On one side of this road, there's an 8-foot-high barricade with wire on top. There's also a barricade on the other side of the road. On the third side of this road, there's a large iron barricade, and there's a barricade on the other side of this ditch as well. The Delhi Police have directly tampered with the crime scene. They have openly committed fraud by altering it. It's obvious to everyone here that the biker could only have fallen if someone had thrown him from an aeroplane. This is clear to any basic person... Did the man just appear out of thin air? Should any department stoop to such a level of depravity? Can any government fall to such a low level of dishonesty, just to claim that it wasn't anyone's fault and that the boy died on his own? That's why the crime scene was later barricaded from all sides,"" he added.The criticism comes after Kamal Dhyani, a 25-year-old Janakpuri resident, reportedly fell into a deep pit while riding his motorcycle home late Thursday night. Police confirmed the identification of the deceased.Dhyani's brother claimed that the family did not recieve any help even after visiting six police stations and received the information only after calling him on his phone in the morning, which was received by an official to extend the news of his death.Dhyani's friend condemned the police department, saying that they neglected the urgency of the situation by not providing the exact location of his mobile phone during the search, resulting in his death. He further questioned how his phone could not be tracked last night.Meanwhile, Delhi urban development minister Ashish Sood is scheduled to inspect the site on February 7. The Delhi government, on Friday, issued a notification taking cognisance of the incident and assuring action against the responsible authorities.The tragedy has evoked comparisons with a similar incident in January, when a 27-year-old IT professional, Yuvraj Mehta, lost his life after his car plunged into an unmarked, water-filled construction pit in Noida amid dense winter fog. The incident had sparked widespread concern over urban safety standards, incomplete construction sites, and the urgent need for better road safety measures in the Delhi-NCR region.","Kamal dhyani, a 25-year-old janakpuri resident, reportedly fell into a deep pit while riding his motorcycle home late thursday night.

A tourism map still in motion



For years, planning a holiday in India meant choosing between two familiar choices: beach or hills. Goa or Manali. Sand or snow.Not anymore.Today, the most searched destinations on travel apps are just as likely to be Ayodhya as Alibaug, Varanasi as Vagator, Ujjain as Udaipur. A generation that grew up posting sunsets from shacks and selfies from mountain cafés is now booking flights to temple towns, river ghats and heritage streets.India’s tourism map is changing — quietly, steadily, and faster than many imagined.Across India, places once considered peripheral to mainstream tourism – religious towns, heritage cities, riverfront settlements and small cultural hubs – are emerging as year-round travel destinations.Ayodhya, Varanasi, Ujjain, Prayagraj, Dwarka, Puri, Hampi, Madurai and Maheshwar are no longer niche or purpose-driven stops. They are becoming central nodes in India’s tourism geography, drawing millions of travellers who are not just pilgrims, but explorers, photographers, students, influencers, backpackers and international visitors.What’s driving this change is not one factor, but a convergence: religious revival, infrastructure investment, social media discovery, generational travel habits, and a redefinition of what “travel” means in India today.The most decisive force reshaping India’s tourism map is the scale and transformation of religious travel.India has always been a land of pilgrimage, but for much of the post-liberalisation era, religious tourism remained largely disconnected from mainstream travel narratives. Pilgrims travelled with families, stayed briefly, and rarely engaged with destinations beyond ritual.That distinction has collapsed.Data from the Union ministry of tourism and state governments shows that religious tourism now accounts for more than half of all domestic tourist visits in India. In several states, pilgrimage-led travel has overtaken leisure tourism as the primary driver of footfall.Uttar Pradesh illustrates this transformation most starkly. The state reported over 130 crore domestic tourist visits in a single year – 2025, making it India’s most visited state. The surge has been driven overwhelmingly by pilgrimage and heritage circuits connecting Ayodhya, Prayagraj, Varanasi and Mathura–Vrindavan.Ayodhya, once a relatively modest religious town, has undergone a dramatic transformation since the inauguration of the Ram Temple. Annual visitor numbers now run into millions, outpacing several long-established heritage destinations.The city’s airport, railway station, road network and public spaces have been redeveloped to accommodate a scale of travel previously unimaginable for a town of its size.Last year’s Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj, a once in 144 year affair, alone drew footfalls on a scale rarely seen anywhere in the world, making it the largest religious congregation, so much so that it was even visible from space.Varanasi, long considered a place one visited once in a lifetime, has emerged as one of India’s fastest-growing cultural destinations. State government figures show tourist visits crossing 10 crore annually in 2024, with foreign arrivals rising sharply over the past three years. What was once seen primarily as a site of ritual and renunciation is now firmly embedded in India’s travel economy.Tamil Nadu tells a similar story. Temple circuits linking Madurai, Rameswaram, Kanchipuram and Tiruvannamalai account for a majority of domestic travel into the state, drawing millions annually.Maharashtra’s Shirdi–Pandharpur belt, Odisha’s Puri, Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain and Maheshwar, and Gujarat’s Dwarka and Somnath now function as high-volume, year-round tourism economies. Karnataka’s Udupi and Hampi, and West Bengal’s Kalighat and Dakshineswar reflect similar patterns.“Faith has become infrastructure-led,” said a senior employee of a travel agency in Delhi, working at a tech savvy firm which thrives on social media added, “Once access improved, demand exploded.” He says, the jump in visit plans to cities like Varanasi, Chopta, Kedharnath has increased manyfold, and when the char dham yatra opens, demand shoots up.Interestingly the crowd mostly has youths, reflecting a shift from assumed travel preferences.If religious tourism is the backbone of the new travel map, religious events are its accelerators.India’s religious calendar is dense with gatherings that combine faith, spectacle, culture and community – often on a scale unmatched anywhere else in the world. These events are no longer seen only as spiritual congregations; they have become major tourism drivers with global visibility and measurable economic impact.The Maha Kumbh Mela at Prayagraj, held once every 12 years at the Sangam of the Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati, remains the best example. The most recent edition drew hundreds of millions of visits over several weeks, making it the largest human gathering on the planet – so vast that it was visible in satellite imagery. Beyond the ritual bathing, the Kumbh now attracts cultural tourists, photographers, researchers, vloggers and international visitors seeking to witness a phenomenon unmatched in scale.By the end of the event over 660 million people took a dip in Triveni Sangam. The festival generated approximately 1.2 million jobs in sectors like tourism, transportation, healthcare, and retail, significantly boosting the both state and national economies.The organisation of the event saw major revamp for the city, from over 200 roads renovated and 3 lakh plus trees planted.Post event data released by the state shows, trade in daily essentials reached Rs 17,310 crore, while the hotel and travel sectors were at Rs2,800 crore. Religious materials and flowers generated approximately Rs 2,000 crore and Rs 800 crore, respectively.Alongside the Maha Kumbh, the Magh Mela, held annually at Prayagraj, has emerged as a major draw in its own right. While smaller than the Kumbh, it attracts crores of devotees over its duration, sustaining tourism flows every year rather than once a decade.Temporary cities rise on the riverbanks, supported by transport networks, sanitation infrastructure and cultural programming – an example of how religious events are now treated as logistical and tourism exercises at scale.“These events create massive short-term employment and long-term tourism memory,” said an official involved in last year's Mela administration. “People return later with families, friends, even tour groups.” He added, “during mela people come to stay for weeks at times the entire month of snan.”In eastern India, the Puri Rath Yatra draws millions of devotees annually, turning the coastal town into a global focal point for weeks. Odisha government estimates show hotel occupancy peaking across the state during the festival period, while transport networks operate at full capacity.Artisans, street vendors and small businesses see a surge in income, while the event also introduces many first-time visitors to Odisha’s beaches, crafts and heritage circuits.In Varanasi, Dev Deepawali has evolved from a local religious observance into a marquee tourism event. Lakhs of lamps illuminate the ghats of the Ganga on Kartik Purnima, drawing domestic and foreign travellers months in advance.If you think you can walk past the roads of the old holy city easily during and around the month of Diwali, think again. Every corner of the city is filled with people, tourists and visitors. Ghats bustle through the night and probably the night life is never better there.Durga Puja in Kolkata, now recognised by UNESCO, blends religion, art, music and urban culture, drawing tourists not just from India but from Bangladesh, Europe and Southeast Asia.Similarly, Deepotsav in Ayodhya, Holi in Mathura–Vrindavan and Barsana, Navratri in Gujarat, and Thrissur Pooram in Kerala,function as major tourism magnets. These festivals blend religion, culture, music, food and visual spectacle, extending stays and broadening visitor profiles beyond traditional pilgrims.“The festivals are no longer spikes; they are anchors,” said Naveen Singh, a resident of Varanasi who runs a hotel. “They fill rooms, generate repeat visits and stabilize demand.”What is notable is that these events are no longer treated as isolated spikes. State tourism boards actively integrate them into annual calendars, align transport and accommodation planning, and promote them digitally as experiential travel moments.The transformation of religious destinations is not only about numbers.What’s changed is not just where people are travelling, but how they are travelling. Increasingly it is about how these places are experienced, the mark that the visit leaves on the people's mind.Cities like Varanasi, Ujjain and Dwarka are no longer framed merely as sites of ritual obligation. They are increasingly experienced as layered cultural spaces. They are being reimagined – by travellers as much as by planners – as experience-led destinations.Morning boat rides on the Ganga, evening Ganga aartis framed by restored ghats, heritage walks through ancient neighbourhoods, classical music performances, local food trails, classical music performances, and café culture tucked into centuries-old lanes – all now form part of the itinerary.The sacred and the everyday coexist – and travellers engage with both.This shift has been enabled by sustained infrastructure investment: expanded airports, redeveloped railway stations, improved roads, pedestrian corridors, lighting projects and riverfront development.Government schemes such as PRASHAD and Swadesh Darshan have focused on improving tourist facilities around religious and heritage sites, while state tourism departments have leaned into festival-led tourism to keep destinations active year-round.What emerges is a new category of travel – one that blends faith, culture, leisure and storytelling.Leading travel companies of the country are also playing a crucial role in facilitating these travel experiences. Providing millions of devotees and visitors seamless travel solutions, including flight bookings, customized pilgrimage packages, and guided experiences, ensuring a smooth spiritual journey for attendees.While speaking at an event, Rikant Pittie, CEO and Co-Founder, EaseMyTrip said:“Spiritual tourism in India is witnessing significant growth as more travellers seek meaningful experiences at sacred destinations. In 2024, India’s religious tourism market was valued at US$ 202.8 billion, and is expected to grow to US$ 441.2 billion by 2032. Pilgrimage sites like Varanasi, Rishikesh, Tirupati, and Shirdi are attracting millions of devotees annually, contributing to both cultural preservation and economic growth. With improved infrastructure and digital advancements, accessibility to these sites has become easier, further fueling interest in spiritual travel.”India’s foreign tourist arrivals are yet to fully recover to pre-Covid levels, and international media has pointed to concerns ranging from cost to pollution and infrastructure stress. But the recovery, where it is happening, is highly destination-specific.Foreign travellers are increasingly gravitating toward cultural depth rather than checklist sightseeing. Hampi and parts of Rajasthan (deserts and old cities) and Madhya Pradesh, the likes of Khajuraho, and select Himalayan towns have seen renewed interest from overseas visitors looking for immersive experiences – slow travel, spiritual exploration, history, architecture, and everyday life.For many international travellers, India’s emerging destinations offer something that over-touristed global cities no longer do: authenticity without over-curation.For instance, global pop icon Dua Lipa’s travel pattern to India offers a telling anecdote. She first visited the country in 2018 for a vacation with her then boyfriend Issac Carew, explored several iconic locations, including Ranthambore, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kerala, and Goa.She returned again in 2023 on her fourth visit to the country, in late December to spend New Year with her family, this time in a very low profile exploring streets and small towns of Rajasthan. The trip was so out of the media gaze that people only found out about it once Dua herself posted pictures on her social media. Interestingly, during her interaction and exploration with people on streets she received warm welcome and hospitality, but notably no one recognised her to the star she is.Perhaps the most consequential shift reshaping India’s tourism geography is generational.India’s Gen Z and young millennial travellers are not chasing the same markers of travel that defined earlier decades. Monuments still matter, but they are no longer the sole focus. For this cohort, travel is experiential, social and performative.For many, travel is not an escape from daily life, but an extension of identity – curated, shared and remembered through content.Suchna Yadav, a content creator/ influencer working with a travel agency in Delhi says, ""I used to think maybe i'm little old school in my choices or something, that i like visiting the places like Vridnavan, or Chopta temple and other places, but working here made me realise that actually it's not just me. The number of young people I see opting to visit places like Kedarnath, temple circuit in UP, Vaisno Devi and that to in groups (like a group of young guys, or friends, and then families are always there) is just like okay everyone is searching peace. ""Travel platforms report a sharp rise in bookings to spiritual and heritage destinations among travellers under 35, often combining pilgrimage with leisure, photography and food exploration.Well many today discover and decide their travel plans according to the social media, but there are also people who have it the old classic way – movies.Aastha Jha, a young journalist working in Delhi has been to Varanasi twice. She started off her travel journey from the city and her most recent visit has been there as well. The reason? ‘Masaan’ (movie).“Watching Masaan, I was so fascinated by the ‘Ye dukh kahe khatam nahi hota be’ scene, that I made up my mind...if I travel, I will definitely go to Benaras,” she said.Social media has fundamentally altered how destinations are discovered.Instagram reels, YouTube vlogs and travel influencers have turned once-understated towns into aspirational stops. A single viral sunset video from Dwarka or a café walkthrough in Varanasi can reach millions.This has changed the rhythm of tourism:In this new ecosystem, travel is not always about escape. It is about visibility, storytelling and identity.Beyond the headline destinations, India’s tourism boom is quietly lifting lesser-known places into the spotlight.These destinations benefit from a trickle-down effect – travellers extending trips, seeking quieter experiences, or deliberately avoiding crowds.Alongside religious festivals, concerts and large-scale cultural events have emerged as powerful drivers of domestic travel.These events often trigger short, high-intensity travel bursts, filling hotels, boosting transport demand and introducing new audiences to destinations.The effect is cumulative: travellers arrive for an event, discover a place, and return later for leisure or exploration.Over the past couple of years multiple national and international celebrities have held concerts across the country, and their impact has been phenomenal.Now a global superstar Diljit Dosanjh ‘Dil-Luminati’ tour was a sold out game, spanning through multiple cities and the story was the same everywhere, immense demand and sold-out, high-energy shows. So has been the results of Lollapalooza India, Sunidhi Chauhan’s ‘I am Home India tour’ and Shreya Ghosal’s ‘All Hearts Tour’ all of which have been monumental successes.The massive crowd in every show has not been only the locals but people travel cities, states to attend these concerts and events.Similarly, international acts like The Coldplay concerts, Ed Sheeran’s India tour, Maroon 5, Cigarettes After Sex, Akon and many others triggered massive short-term travel spikes. Hotels sold out, flight fares surged, and cities that rarely featured on tourism maps saw first-time visitors.Last year when Coldplay performed in Ahmedabad, the record-breaking shows, featuring 1.34 lakh attendees, created a massive Rs 641 crore economic impact.One of the attendees was Kikruheno Casavi, then a student in Delhi now a working professional in Kohima. She along with her friends who flew all the way from Kohima visited the Ahmedabad, paid much more for the flights to hands down everything from hotels to local travel and food, when compared to regular time, given the high demand, at the end she ended of spending close to lakh on the concert, that was a good influx into the economy. So has been the impact of these massive events on the domestic travel and economy.One of the most profound changes in Indian tourism is how destinations are discovered.For decades, tourism marketing centred on a narrow set of icons – beaches, palaces, monuments. Today, social media has emerged as a powerful equaliser. A single Instagram reel of a sunset in Dwarka or a café walk-through in Varanasi can reach millions, bypassing traditional campaigns entirely.Unlike curated brochures or seasonal campaigns, digital storytelling is organic, constant and often driven by travellers themselves. A single reel, vlog or photo series can introduce millions to places that once barely featured on travel maps. As a result, destinations are no longer marketed only as pilgrimage stops or heritage sites, but as spaces for culture, leisure, food and everyday exploration.Travel platforms, too, have adapted. Pilgrimage packages now integrate leisure, experiences and flexible itineraries. Boutique stays, heritage homestays and experiential tours have become anchors of tourism ecosystems.The change in narrative – from “must-see” landmarks to “must-feel” moments – has made India’s emerging destinations more accessible, relatable and aspirational, particularly for younger travellers.In many ways, the tourism boom reflects not a discovery of new places, but a reframing of familiar ones – amplified by platforms where authenticity, not advertising, now drives attention.The tourism shift has tangible economic consequences. Hospitality players report higher occupancy rates across the year, not just during peak seasons. Local economies – transport operators, guides, artisans, food vendors – benefit from sustained demand rather than seasonal spikes.At the same time, challenges are mounting. Overcrowding, waste management, environmental stress and infrastructure capacity pose real risks. Experts warn that without heritage-sensitive planning and sustainability measures, the very qualities drawing travellers could be compromised.What’s clear is that India’s tourism map is no longer static – or metro-centric.It is being reshaped by faith and culture, by digital discovery, by younger travellers redefining value, and by destinations once overlooked now stepping into the national and global imagination.The shift underway is not about discovering new places, but about seeing familiar ones differently. And in that reframing, India’s tourism future is quietly being rewritten.And in that shift, the most interesting stories may lie far beyond Mumbai and Goa.","India’s tourism map is changing — quietly, steadily, and faster than many imagined. Places once considered peripheral to mainstream tourism are emerging as year-round travel destinations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127992027,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-149154,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
