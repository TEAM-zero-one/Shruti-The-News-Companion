Lucknow: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday said the legacy of Sikh gurus, who gave everything for faith, nation and humanity, continues to guide India's path of progress.""History is shaped only by those who embody sacrifice and renunciation. The history of Sikh gurus in India is a history of the extraordinary radiance of devotion and strength,"" the CM said while paying tributes to the four ‘Sahibzadas' of Guru Gobind Singh and Guru Tegh Bahadur on his 350th martyrdom anniversary on Friday.Speaking at a kirtan organised to mark Veer Bal Diwas, the day the four Sahibzadas were martyred, Yogi said the occasion was an opportunity to pay tribute to the sacrifice of Baba Ajit Singh, Baba Jujhar Singh, Baba Zorawar Singh and Baba Fateh Singh. He thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for giving national recognition to the event.The CM added that where Guru Nanak spread his message across India, Guru Tegh Bahadur and Guru Gobind Singh highlighted their devotion through sacrifices and commitments.""This year marks the 350th anniversary of the martyrdom of the ninth Sikh Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji. It is a coincidence that while marking the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, I had the privilege of announcing Dec 26 as Veer Bal Diwas.This day is now being observed in schools, colleges and offices across the country, and the stories of the Sahibzadas have been included in the curriculum to inspire the younger generation with the values of sacrifice and selflessness,"" he said.The CM spoke about the Sikh tradition of langar as a powerful symbol of social harmony, which transcended caste and religion, highlighting the role of Guru Gobind Singh in uniting society.Yogi also paid respect to Guru Gobind Singh and Mata Gujri Devi, saying that the sacrifice of their sons, now celebrated as Veer Bal Diwas, was a source of inspiration for India's youth.The CM also assured full support of the BJP govt in the state and the Centre for organising events to mark the 350th martyrdom year of Guru Tegh Bahadur.",Yogi adityanath pays tribute to the four ‘sahibzadas’ of guru gobind singh and guru tegh bahadur on his 350th martyrdom anniversary on friday.

Life of Husain's mural insecure at LIC HQ in Mumbai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/life-of-husains-mural-insecure-at-lic-hq-in-mumbai/articleshow/126198434.cms,"M F Husain painted the mural in 1963 after winning a competition. He was paid Rs 1,000 for the work

MUMBAI: Pablo Picasso famously said that ""art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life,"" but at the Yogakshema Building at Nariman Point, which houses the headquarters of the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), a wall mural painted by M F Husain appears to be doing the opposite, quietly accumulating dust as visitors and employees offer only fleeting glances while passing through the metal detector at the security screening area.The mural, depicting a female musician, is located on the wall directly opposite the security checking area in the lobby of the building's east wing.It shows visible signs of deterioration, including cracks, tearing and layers of settled dust. Ongoing renovation work, including plastering and the erection of scaffolding, has been carried out close to the artwork, placing it at further risk of damage.Though a metal detector stands next to the mural, there is no name plaque to inform the thousands who pass through the entrance about the value and heritage of the work.Painted in 1963, the mural was created after Husain won a competition organised by LIC to adorn the lobby of its then newly inaugurated headquarters. Husain was paid Rs 1,000 for the commission.Brinda Miller of the Kala Ghoda Arts Association said such neglect was not unusual.""A mosaic mural by Jatin Das was similarly destroyed in a government building years ago. In contrast, another Husain mural inside a restaurant at the Cricket Club of India stands beautifully preserved,"" she said, adding that wall art in India is often undervalued.Conservation architect Vikas Dilawari said the issue extended across institutions. He cited neglect of a K K Hebbar mural at Nair Hospital and noted that Husain painted directly onto the marble wall, requiring protection during construction.Raisa, the artist's daughter, called the situation a ""tragedy"". When contacted, LIC executive director Pradeep Shenoy said he was unaware of the mural's value and would look into providing protection","M f husain painted the mural in 1963 after winning a competition.

Pizhaiththa Thennandhoppu—The Spared Grove

Rain can create havoc and harm; yet for those

afflicted, rain alone becomes refuge.

I was standing by a glass window, watching the rain . The sound was muted, yet the sight was anything but gentle. Jets of water struck the glass ferociously, as though the sky itself was knocking—urgent, restless. I was reminded that nature often speaks most powerfully even when unheard.As I watched, my thoughts drifted to poets across eras and cultures, separated by time and geography, and to how rain has unfailingly served as a spring of creativity.Keen observation, emotional depth, and mastery over language allow them to distil fleeting moments into enduring truths. Whether ancient or modern, poetry repeatedly returns to the same elemental concerns—love and loss, despair and hope , destruction and renewal.Tamil poetry offers a striking illustration of this convergence. From the Sangam era onward, poets lived in intimate dialogue with their landscape. Nature was never a passive backdrop; it was a symbolic language. Love, separation, anticipation, and sorrow were mapped onto hills, forests, seashores, and rain-laden skies.Kapilar, one of the greatest Sangam poets, exemplifies this sensitivity. In a celebrated verse, he describes a lovelorn heroine stringing a garland of 99 flowers after bathing in a waterfall. Each flower suggests a slightly different shade of love—desire, tenderness, hesitation, ache.On Nov 30, 1916, Subramania Bharati, then living in Puducherry, witnessed a devastating cyclone that ravaged the coast. In its wake, he composed, often described as the ghostly dance of divine rain. For Bharati, rain a cosmic force—fierce and sublime.The day after the storm, he walked along the shore and found dead birds scattered on the beach. It is said that he gathered them using his turban cloth and buried them. Later, he visited a coconut grove owned by a poor friend. While neighbouring farms lay uprooted, this small grove alone had survived. From this experience emerged. Bharati marvels at the rain’s benevolence in protecting the poorest, seeing in it both fury and compassion.Centuries earlier, Andal had offered a different, equally radical vision. In one evocative passage, she watches thunderous rain and imagines it as Krishna himself. The dark raincloud becomes his blue form; lightning is likened to the Sudarshana Chakra; thunder becomes the Panchajanya conch, the sound of cosmic creation. Yet she asks the rain to nourish the world, not to destroy it. Emotion, theology, and ecology merge seamlessly.Thiruvalluvar, earlier still, devoted an entire chapter to rain. One couplet captures its paradox with timeless clarity:Keduppadhoong Kettaarkku Charvaaimatr AangeEdupadhoom Ellaam MazhaiValluvar had already distilled its essence into a few spare lines. Rain may wound and rain may heal, he reminds us, but it is rain alone that sustains life. In that truth lies the shared wisdom of poets across time: what falls from the heavens carries both burden and blessing, and it is in learning to receive it with humility that the world endures.It was perhaps the last rain of this calendar year. The clouds had emptied themselves, the windowpane stood clear again, and the world returned to stillness. Yet rain, like poetry, does not obey calendars. It will return—in another season, another century, another line of verse. Long after dates are forgotten, rain will continue to fall, and poets will continue to listen.","Thirukkural is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality.

NEW DELHI: CBI on Friday filed a special leave petition in Supreme Court against Delhi high court's recent order suspending the sentence of expelled BJP ex-MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in the Unnao rape case.The probe agency has sought an immediate stay on the relief granted to Sengar, arguing against his release pending the final disposal of his appeal against conviction and life sentence.A division bench on HC had in its Tuesday order said that the trial court erred in categorising the former UP MLA as a 'public servant' and awarding the maximum punishment for 'aggravated penetrative sexual assault' under section 5 of Pocso Act The bench stated that an MLA did not come under the definition of a 'public servant' either under Pocso Act or IPC, and hence Sengar's offence did not fall within the ambit of Section 5.The trial court had convicted Sengar in Dec 2019 for the rape of a minor in Unnao in 2017, sentencing him to life imprisonment and a fine of Rs 25 lakh.While the former Unnao MLA moved Delhi high court in Jan 2020 challenging his conviction, in March 2022 he filed a petition seeking the suspension of his sentence.Throughout the proceedings, CBI and the survivor vehemently opposed any form of relief to Sengar, citing the gravity of his crime and the potential threat to the complainant and witnesses.

The incident was triggered after Mondal entered the area with the intent of collecting extortion money.""Rather, it arose from a violent situation stemming from extortion and criminal activities. The deceased, Amrit Mondal alias Samrat, was a listed top criminal who had entered the area with the intent of collecting extortion money. At one stage, he lost his life during a clash with agitated local residents,"" the statement read.""It is noteworthy that Amrit Mondal alias Samrat was accused in multiple serious criminal cases, including murder and extortion cases filed in 2023, and arrest warrants had been issued against him in those cases,"" it added.According to locals, Samrat had formed a criminal gang and had long been involved in extortion and other criminal activities. After remaining in hiding in India for a long time, he recently returned home and allegedly demanded extortion money from Shahidul Islam, a resident of the village.According to the police investigation, Mondal and his associates entered the area with the intention of extorting money.Mondal and members of his group went to Shahidul's house to collect the money. When the occupants raised an alarm shouting ""robbers"", locals rushed to the spot and beat Samrat.His other associates managed to flee, while Selim was caught with weapons.""Police arrested his associate, Selim, from the scene along with one foreign-made pistol and one pipe gun. Three cases have already been filed in connection with this incident, and law enforcement agencies are continuing their investigation,"" the statement read.Meanwhile, the interim government condemned the killing and said it does not support any form of unlawful action.""The government strongly condemns this killing. The government wishes to state unequivocally that it does not support any form of extrajudicial activity, mob violence, or unlawful conduct under any circumstances. Legal action will be taken against all those directly or indirectly involved in the incident,"" it said.The statement also expressed concern over attempts to project the incident as a communal attack.""The government urges all concerned to act responsibly and refrain from spreading misleading, provocative, or communal statements,"" the statement said.Reiterating its ""commitment"" to law and order, the interim government's statement read, ""The government remains firmly committed to upholding the rule of law and ensuring justice.

A concert of Bangladeshi rock musician James was called off after what the organisers described as an ""attack from the outsiders.""

Horror In Coimbatore: Student Gang Raped After Abduction, Three Accused Shot And Arrested By Police

GWALIOR: A 26-year-old engineer died after allegedly consuming poison at his uncle’s house in Gwalior on Saturday.The man was facing a rape case under the POCSO Act in Dabra involving a 2-year-and-11-month-old girl.His family alleged that he was being blackmailed for money to “settle” the case.The deceased, identified as Love, also known as Lovejeet Singh Rana, was a BTech graduate and a resident of Ramgarh in Dabra.He had been living in Purushottam Vihar Colony with his uncle after losing his job following the registration of the case.He allegedly consumed poison on Friday night. Family members found him in critical condition on Saturday morning and rushed him to the hospital, where doctors declared him dead.According to the family, the girl’s mother had demanded Rs 60 lakh to withdraw the case. They claimed Rs 30 lakh had already been paid, but the pressure continued for the remaining amount.The family also accused the complainant’s lawyer of issuing threats and pressuring them for money. They alleged that the sustained pressure pushed Love into depression, leading to his suicide.Police said an FIR under the POCSO Act had been registered at Dabra City police station in April after the woman alleged that Lovejeet and another man took her daughter for a car ride and returned her frightened, following which she noticed an injury.The allegations had sparked outrage at the time.Lovejeet, who had reportedly topped his board exams in Dabra, completed his engineering from an institute in Indore and was working with a multinational company in Gurgaon.

Truck drivers say they are being punished for state errors

Federal pressure and political fallout

Livelihoods and supply chains at risk





Thousands of Indian truck drivers in California have launched a legal challenge against the state after being told their commercial driving licences will be cancelled. Drivers say the move threatens their livelihoods and has left their families in limbo. The lawsuit follows decisions by the California Department of Motor Vehicles to revoke licences issued to immigrant drivers after a federal audit flagged problems with expiry dates. Many of the affected drivers are Punjabi Sikhs, according to advocacy groups, who say the crackdown has led to increased profiling of drivers in the industry.The dispute centres on around 20,000 commercial driver’s licences (CDLs) that the DMV says were issued with expiration dates extending beyond the period drivers were authorised to stay and work in the United States. On 6 November, the agency sent 60-day cancellation notices to roughly 17,000 drivers, a figure that has since risen as more cases were reviewed.Civil rights groups argue the problem stems from clerical mistakes made by the DMV itself, not wrongdoing by drivers. Under California law, they say, the agency is required either to correct such errors or allow licence holders to reapply for amended documents. Instead, the DMV halted the issuing, renewal and correction of non-resident CDLs, leaving drivers with no clear way to fix the issue.“The state of California must help these drivers because the clerical errors threatening their livelihoods are of the state’s own making,” said Munmeeth Kaur, legal director of the Sikh Coalition, which filed the class-action lawsuit alongside the Asian Law Caucus.Advocacy groups say the crackdown followed increased scrutiny from the Trump administration after a fatal truck crash in Florida earlier this year became a national political issue. Federal officials accused several states, including California, of lax licensing standards and pushed tougher enforcement of immigration and English-language proficiency rules for commercial drivers.The Sikh Coalition says the response has had wider consequences, including racial profiling of Sikh truckers, many of whom wear turbans and beards as part of their faith. Industry figures warn that stricter federal policies could remove hundreds of thousands of drivers from the workforce nationwide over the coming years.For drivers, the immediate impact is stark. Losing a CDL means losing the legal right to work, while the threatened cancellation of regular driving licences would prevent them from driving at all. Many affected drivers are the sole earners for their families and have invested heavily in trucks, homes and small transport businesses.“If the court does not step in, we will see a devastating wave of unemployment that harms families and destabilises supply chains,” Kaur said.The DMV has declined to comment on the lawsuit but has previously said it is prepared to reissue licences if federal objections are lifted. The plaintiffs argue the agency already has the authority under state law to correct or reinstate the licences without waiting for Washington.","Thousands of indian truck drivers in california have launched a legal challenge against the state after being told their commercial driving licences will be cancelled.

Statistics and silence: What trauma leaves undocumented

Every reported crime carries a backstory that never makes it into the case file. Before the FIR, there is the moment of doubt, whether to speak, whom to trust, and what might follow. For countless women in India, that moment ends in silence.That silence is in reality filled with a lot of calculations, the fear that people might not believe them, families asking them to ""let it go"" because of the risk of retaliation or to protect family honour, the cost of legal battles that can go for years, and the silent understanding that the road to justice, even when promised, can be unforgiving. For most women, safety is not a guarantee. It is something worked out every day, by calculation which roads to avoid, staying quiet in unfamiliar spaces, adjusting behaviour, and often living with an abuse that feels easier to manage than to report.In 2025, crime data remains the only way women’s safety in India is judged. These numbers shape headlines, policy debates, and official claims of progress. But they reflect only those cases that enter the criminal justice system.Far more experiences remain outside the record, abuse within homes, harassment in public spaces, threats online, incidents that never become complaints because the cost of speaking up feels higher than the abuse itself.The most recent comprehensive figures from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) are from 2022. Since then, there has been no official dataset available, leaving a gap in understanding more recent trends and ground reality.As per data reported in 2022, India recorded 4,45,256 cases of crimes against women, reflecting a 4 per cent increase from the previous year and translating to an average of 51 complaints every hour. The national crime rate stood at 66.4 cases per lakh women. While these numbers point to the persistence of gender-based violence, they also reveal widely contrasting data across states. Union Territory Delhi reported a crime rate of 144.4 per cent, more than double the national average, while Haryana (118.7) and Telangana (117.6) also recorded significantly higher rates.Such variations raise critical questions: do higher numbers indicate greater prevalence of crime, better reporting mechanisms, or a combination of both?Official statistics, however, capture only those incidents that enter the criminal justice system formally and are reported. A substantial body of evidence suggests that a large proportion of violence against women remains unaccounted for, particularly when it occurs within households or involves perpetrators known to the survivor. Data from the National Family Health Survey–5 (2019–21) paints a starkly different picture of women’s lived experiences.According to the survey, nearly one in three married women in India, 32 per cent, at some point in their lives, have faced physical, sexual, or emotional violence at the hands of their husbands, while 6.1 per cent reported experiencing sexual violence. The contrast between these prevalence-based findings and police-recorded crime figures highlights a persistent gap between reality and reporting.This gap is shaped by multiple factors: fear of retaliation, social pressure that stems from maintaining one’s family’s honour, lack of trust in law enforcement, prolonged judicial processes, and economic dependence. In rural areas and among communities living on the fringes, these barriers are often compounded by limited access to police stations, legal aid, and survivor support services. Even in urban areas, where reporting is relatively higher, cybercrime and workplace harassment may be beyond regulatory scope or are addressed through informal mechanisms rather than criminal complaints.In 2025, crime statistics continue to remain an indispensable tool for understanding trends, allocating resources, and holding institutions accountable. Yet numbers alone cannot capture the full extent of women’s vulnerability, resilience, or the systemic failures that allow violence to persist.An increase in the number of First Information Reports (FIRs) registered does not automatically signal a spike in crime; in many cases, it reflects changes in reporting behaviour, policing frameworks, and legal awareness. This distinction is crucial when interpreting data on crimes against women, where historically low reporting has long masked the true scale of violence.One key factor behind higher FIR counts is improved access to the justice system. Supreme Court rulings mandating the compulsory registration of FIRs for cognisable offences, coupled with women’s help desks at the state-level, online portals for lodging complaints, and dedicated women’s police stations, have lowered procedural barriers that previously discouraged survivors from coming forward. In such contexts, rising FIR numbers may indicate institutional responsiveness rather than an actual rise in such incidents.Shifts in social attitudes also play a significant role. Greater public discussion around gender-based violence, through media coverage, civil society advocacy, and movements demanding accountability, has contributed to increased awareness of legal rights among women.However, it is pertinent to note that increased FIR registration does not eliminate concerns about underreporting. Crimes such as domestic violence, marital sexual abuse, cyber harassment, and trafficking remain highly underrepresented in police data. In many cases, complaints are withdrawn, informally “settled,” or never converted into FIRs due to pressure from families or local authorities. Additionally, rising numbers of FIRs often are not proportionately reflected in advances made to charges and convictions. It raises questions about whether the system is equipped to handle greater reporting effectively.Recent findings from the National Annual Report and Index on Women’s Safety, released by the National Commission for Women (NCW), further underline the limits of relying solely on official crime statistics to assess women’s safety.Based on a survey of 12,770 women across 31 cities, the report seeks to document unreported harassment, everyday experiences, and perceptions of safety that rarely enter police records. India received a national safety score of 65 per cent, with six in ten women saying they felt safe in their city. However, a substantial 40 per cent still described themselves as “not so safe” or “unsafe,” revealing a significant perception gap.The data shows that while educational institutions are viewed as relatively safe by 86 per cent of respondents during the day, feelings of safety decline sharply at night and in off-campus spaces. The survey also found that 7 per cent of women reported experiencing harassment in public spaces in 2024, a figure that rises to 14 per cent among women under 24, identifying young women as a particularly vulnerable group. Crucially, the report highlights pervasive underreporting, with nearly two-thirds of harassment incidents never formally reported, suggesting that NCRB figures capture only a fraction of the problem. Neighbourhoods (38 per cent) and public transport (29 per cent) emerged as the most frequently cited harassment hotspots.Women’s responses to harassment varied widely: 28 per cent confronted the harasser, 25 per cent left the area, and only 20 per cent approached authorities reflecting low confidence in institutional redress. Indeed, just one in three victims filed a formal complaint, pointing to enduring trust deficits in policing and complaint mechanisms, and reinforcing the gap between lived experience and recorded crime.For many survivors of violence, the decision to report an offence is shaped less by the severity of the crime than by the social and institutional costs of speaking out. Policing structures, patriarchal norms, and sustained pressure from families and communities combine to create formidable barriers to reporting, particularly in cases involving sexual violence, domestic abuse, or harassment by known perpetrators. While legal frameworks mandate the registration of complaints, the lived experience of engaging with the criminal justice system often deters survivors from approaching it in the first place.Interactions with the police remain a significant point of friction. Survivors frequently cite fear of being disbelieved, questioned about their character, or pressured into compromise rather than a formal complaint. In cases of domestic violence or sexual assault, women are often encouraged to deal with matters in private spaces, reflecting deeply ingrained attitudes that prioritise social harmony over individual justice. Procedural hurdles, such as repeated visits to police stations, insensitive questioning, or delays in registering First Information Reports, further discourage reporting, especially for women with limited mobility, financial dependence, or caregiving responsibilities.Patriarchal expectations within families and communities add another layer of pressure. Survivors may be warned that reporting violence will bring shame, damage marriage prospects, or invite social ostracism. In intimate partner violence, economic dependence and concern for children’s welfare frequently compel women to endure abuse in silence. Young women, in particular, face heightened scrutiny, with families often prioritising “reputation” over accountability, discouraging formal complaints even when harm is severe.These pressures are compounded by structural weaknesses in survivor support systems.Together, policing practices, patriarchal control, and social pressure create a climate where silence appears safer than disclosure. As a result, official crime data captures only a narrow slice of women’s experiences, masking the depth of violence that continues to shape everyday life.Crime data is designed to count incidents, not to measure the enduring weight of trauma or the complex realities of survival. While statistics can indicate how many cases were reported, registered, or prosecuted, they remain largely silent on what violence does to women’s bodies, minds, livelihoods, and relationships long after the event. The aftermath of abuse, fear, anxiety, depression, disrupted education or employment, and fractured social ties rarely appears in official records, even though these consequences often shape a survivor’s life more profoundly than the crime itself.Numbers also fail to capture the uneven paths to survival. For many women, continuing daily life involves constant negotiation: avoiding certain routes, abandoning jobs, changing schools, or remaining in unsafe homes due to financial dependence or lack of shelter. These acts of adaptation and endurance are invisible in crime statistics, which treat incidents as discrete events rather than ongoing experiences. A closed case or a withdrawn complaint may signal resolution on paper, but it often masks unresolved harm or coercive compromise.Equally absent from the data are the cumulative effects of repeated, low-level violence, verbal abuse, intimidation, stalking, and digital harassment that may not meet reporting thresholds but steadily erode a sense of safety and autonomy. Crime figures can show whether violence is counted, but not whether dignity is restored.Without incorporating survivor-centred perspectives, trauma-informed indicators, and long-term outcomes, data risks reducing deeply personal suffering to abstract totals, obscuring both the cost of violence and the resilience required to live with it.","In 2025, crime data remains the only way women’s safety in india is judged. But they reflect only those cases that enter the criminal justice system. Far more experiences remain outside the record, abuse within homes, harassment in public spaces. India received a national safety score of 65 per cent, with six in ten women saying they felt safe in their city.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126190684,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1336965,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The CBI on Friday filed a Special Leave Petition in the Supreme Court challenging the Delhi high court’s order suspending the life sentence of the Unnao rape convict and former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar.According to a CBI spokesperson, the decision was taken after examining the order passed by the high court’s division bench.The agency’s move came three days after the HC granted relief to Sengar, an order that sparked widespread outrage and led to protests by the victim, her mother, and women's groups.The survivor of the June 2017 assault had already said she would approach the top court.On Tuesday, a division bench of Justices Subramonium Prasad and Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar ordered the suspension of Sengar’s sentence during the pendency of his appeal against conviction and life imprisonment, subject to the furnishing of a bail bond of Rs 15 lakh. He was also granted conditional bail.The bench directed that the politician shall not enter a five-kilometre radius of the area in Delhi where the survivor resides. He has also been ordered to remain in the national capital and to have no contact with the woman and her family members.Senior advocate N Hariharan, along with advocate SP Tripathi, appeared for Sengar and argued that their client was not a public servant at the time of the offence.They also contended that there were “discrepancies” in documents relating to the survivor’s age and said medical evidence should be relied upon.Opposing the bail plea, advocate Mehmood Pracha, appearing for the victim, submitted that there had been “serious threats” to her life in the past. Pracha pointed out that she had earlier been provided security, which was later withdrawn, and highlighted that her father was assaulted in police custody and later died due to his injuries — a case in which Sengar was separately convicted.The former MLA remains in judicial custody as he has not been granted bail in the second case, for which he was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment. He has also challenged his conviction and sentence in that matter.The Uttar Pradesh government transferred the investigation to the CBI in April 2018. In August 2019, the Supreme Court shifted the case and all related proceedings from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi to ensure a fair and speedy trial. Sengar was convicted and sentenced in December that year.","Cbi has filed a special leave petition in the supreme court challenging the delhi high court’s order suspending the life sentence of the unnao rape convict and former bjp mla kuldeep singh sengar.

NEW DELHI: The year 2025 is drawing to an end and most people are busy figuring out the New Year's resolutions. Every new year promises change and every December claims a reset.This year, India moved fast, yet some headlines felt like deja vu.In some cases, the names, dates and locations changed, but the storylines did not - a dominant BJP , a drifting Congress , toxic Delhi air, Pakistan‑linked terror. Several themes remained the same, think: sexist soundbites by netas, language wars and renaming frenzies.In 2025, BJP once again proved that the default setting of India remains “saffron”. The party registered emphatic wins in both Delhi and Bihar – two very different, politically crucial states.In February, BJP ended its Delhi drought and stormed back to power after 27 years. It won 48 of 70 assembly seats with around 46% vote share. The incumbent AAP government slumped to 22 seats and got around 44%.In Bihar, where the NDA was fighting an anti‑incumbency wave, the alliance swept the assembly with 202 of 243 seats. The BJP emerged as the single-largest party with 89 seats. The party got nearly 21% vote share.In Maharashtra, the BJP-led Mahayuti won 207 municipal councils and nagar panchayat seats of the 288, securing a single largest majority.The BJP won most of them, securing 117 seats, Shiv Sena 53 and NCP 37 seats. Congress won 28 seats.As the results were counted on various days for different elections, the headline still read - BJP starts favourite, BJP finishes first.If BJP’s script stayed familiar, so did the Congress’s. The party’s national brand continued to underperform even where local anger against incumbents was visible.This year, after failing to even open the account in the Delhi elections, the party held the AICC meet in Ahmedabad in April. Same age-old issues were raised: call to rebuild the organisation from booth‑level, sharpen the party’s ideological pitch beyond anti‑BJP rhetoric and regain lost ground in the Hindi belt.But again in Bihar, Congress managed to win only 6 seats with 8.7% vote share.This year, the Congress story, yet again, remained about its potential and plans rather than outcomes.Election after election, the analysis throughout the year kept throwing up the same words: ""fragmented"", ""faction‑ridden"", “no ground-level connection”.Cricket fandom in 2025 remained addicted to its favourite off‑field sport - guessing when India’s modern greats will walk away from the field.After announcing retirement from the T20 format last year, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli played reduced schedules. However, every match, series, or dip in form or rest sparked ""is this his last?"" debate.But RoKo ended the year as No. 1 and 2 batsmen in ICC ODI rankings. The duo were also back with a bang in the domestic Vijay Hazare Trophy after years.At home, MS Dhoni, long retired from international cricket but still a Chennai Super Kings totem, stayed in the retirement gossip each IPL match. Talking about reading too much into it, people went crazy this year over his t-shirt ahead of the IPL season that had ""one last time"" written in Morse code.He obviously went on to play in 2025 and also took over as CSK skipper mid-season after captain Ruturaj Gaikwad suffered an injury.From Diwali to winter, it was the same story in Delhi once again. By December, the city’s AQI remained in the “severe” to “hazardous” range for days at a stretch. GRAP restrictions were imposed repeatedly, cycling through Stages 1, 2, 3 and 4. One analysis showed sustained AQI levels above 500 through mid‑December, with peaks over 600 and no meaningful dips into safer categories, underscoring that this was not a one‑day spike but a chronic toxic wall.Flights were delayed, schools moved online, construction bans returned, and familiar visuals of masked children, disappearing India Gate and grey skylines flooded the feeds.Experts once more cited the same cocktail: winter inversion, low wind, vehicle and industrial emissions, and stubble burning. Policy responses remained reactive and short‑term.With this, the headline seemed copy‑pasted from almost any winter in the past decade: “Delhi chokes”, ""Delhi turns gas chamber"", ""Delhi air turns red"".In 2022, when Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman was asked about the sliding rupee, she had said: ""I would not look at it as rupee sliding, I would look at it as dollar strengthening.""In 2025, the rupee quietly set fresh records for weakness against the US dollar. After relative stability, it fell to an all‑time low of Rs 91 in December.The rupee has slid by 5-6% so far this year, making it Asia’s worst-performing currency this year.Addressing the concerns, the finance minister stated earlier this month: ""The rupee will find its own level.Meanwhile, analysts point to a wider trade deficit, foreign portfolio outflows, and Donald Trump’s 50% tariffs on Indian goods for the slide.2025 did not break the pattern of Pakistan‑linked terrorism. On April 22, a terrorist attack near Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir killed 26 civilians, mostly Hindu tourists. The probe revealed that the mastermind of the attack was a Lashkar‑e‑Taiba offshoot, The Resistance Front.This was followed by India's strong response with Operation Sindoor in which the missiles destroyed the terror infrastructure linked to Jaish‑e‑Mohammed and Lashkar‑e‑Taiba in Pakistan and the Pakistan‑occupied Kashmir region.Islamabad once again refused to own up while its Army majors were seen attending funerals of the terrorists.The headline “Terror strains India–Pakistan ties yet again” remained sadly accurate.If there is one genre of political controversy that never goes out of fashion, it is misogynistic remarks by our leaders. This year gave us multiple examples, cutting across parties and states. In early January, BJP MP Ramesh Bidhuri drew outrage for a sexist comment about Priyanka Gandhi, prompting Congress and AAP leaders to call it proof of a “deeply anti-women” mindset.“Lalu said in Bihar that he would make roads like Hema Malini’s cheeks, but he lied, he could not do it. I assure you that just as we made the roads in Okhla and Sangam Vihar, we will make all the roads in Kalkaji like Priyanka Gandhi’s cheeks,” Bidhuri had said.In Kerala, a CPI(M) leader won a panchayat seat, took out a victory rally, and said that “women are only for sleeping with husbands”.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar stirred a row by pulling the naqab of a hijab-wearing woman at an event. What followed was even more disturbing. BJP leader Giriraj Singh defended the CM’s act, saying Kumar had behaved like a “guardian” and that the woman could take the job or “go to hell”. Bihar governor Arif Mohammad Khan also spoke along similar lines and added that Nitish “considers female students his daughters”.This year, Bihar also threw up other such moments. Nitish found himself in trouble after saying, “Girls have become so confident. They speak so well and dress up so well. Did we see them wearing such fine clothes earlier?”RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad Yadav, too, passed a lewd remark about Nitish, suggesting he was participating in a women’s rally to “ogle at women”. “Nayan sekne ja rahe hain,” he said when asked about Nitish’s Mahila Samvad Yatra.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee also invited criticism after resorting to victim-blaming while defending her government following a gangrape case. “Why was she out at midnight?” Mamata asked.The response cycle was identical each time: viral clip > outrage > absurd defence > forgotten. The headline “Neta’s sexist remarks trigger storm” could have been reused almost every month.India’s language politics remained combustible. In 2025, much of the heat centred on school language policy and perceived “Hindi imposition” in non‑Hindi states. In Maharashtra, a BJP‑led government's move to make Hindi compulsory from Class 1 to 5 triggered a backlash.Parallel debates raged in southern states over NEP’s three‑language formula and the balance between English, regional languages and Hindi with Tamil Nadu MK Stalin taking the charge. The core storyline of the “language war” – Centre‑pushed Hindi vs regional pride and access concerns – remained unchanged.Renaming towns, villages and roads stayed a favourite symbolic tool. In 2025, Uttarakhand grabbed headlines by renaming 11 places across four districts, replacing names like Aurangzebpur and Mohammadpur Jat with Shivaji Nagar, Mohanpur Jat, Shri Krishnapur, Ambedkar Nagar and Jyotiba Phule Nagar, among others.The finale came during the Winter session of Parliament when the Centre came up with the Viksit Bharat—Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) aka VB—G RAM G Bill that replaced the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005 (MGNREGA).Even as India debated war, the rupee and air quality, one light but telling constant stayed in pop‑political culture: the obsession with the marital status of the eternal bachelors of India. Salman Khan, about to celebrate his 60th birthday, and Rahul Gandhi, still unmarried and still central to the Congress story, remained prime targets of perennial “shaadi kab karoge?” question.In fact, during the run-up to the Bihar Assembly elections, Rahul occasionally used the topic to lighten the mood at press conferences. While sharing a stage with Tejashwi Yadav, he revealed that Lalu Prasad Yadav had advised him to get married soon.Tejashwi, however, used the same platform to turn the spotlight on another eligible bachelor - his rival Chirag Paswan - publicly urging him to tie the knot.","Top 10 headlines of 2025 that remained the same, like every year!

CHANDIGARH: Punjab and Haryana high court has ordered that a man convicted of raping and murdering a five-year-old girl remain behind bars for 30 years without remission, holding that his incarceration must continue until he nears loss of ""virility"" to prevent further sexual crimes.""To save other children and women, the convict must remain within the four walls of the prison until he is closer to the sunset of his virility,"" a division bench of Justices Anoop Chitkara and Sukhvinder Kaur ordered after commuting the convict's death sentence.The case dates to May 31, 2018, when the child was raped and stabbed to death in a village in Haryana's Palwal district by the man, who was a long-time employee of her father. Her body was stuffed into a flour storage drum in the courtyard of his house.CCTV footage from a nearby school showed him leading the child towards his home. He was convicted of kidnapping, rape, murder, criminal conspiracy, and destruction of evidence IPC and Pocso Act , and sentenced to death.He appealed in HC, which upheld his conviction but spared him the gallows and acquitted his mother of the charge of shielding him.""In a civilised society, this barbaric incident would not have happened, and if it did, a mother would have preferred justice for 'Laado' (the name given to victim by the court) than for her 'Raja-beta',"" the bench observed, adding: ""This social attitude, however appalling, is not new.It is deeply embedded in the region's patriarchal mindset and culture.""HC was of the view that to be proportionate, any sentence must be stable and balanced like a table, and for any table to be stable, all its legs must be comparable. Thus, the courts, while awarding a sentence, are under an obligation to consider the crime, victim, criminal and his family, society and the state, the bench observed.HC observed that the facts on record indicate a gruesome crime because 'Laado' was walking with the convict, swaying one hand and letting the convict hold her other hand in absolute trust, ""without the mental age or information to suspect the probable evil of a devil"".However, the convict has no criminal antecedents, and his conduct in prison is not violative, which makes reformation possible, HC observed. ""Considering the victim's age to be 5 years and 7 months, we are convinced to impose a sentence of 30 years, without remission... The fine is enhanced to Rs 30 lakh,"" HC ruled.","Punjab and haryana high court orders man to remain behind bars for 30 years. He was convicted of raping and murdering a five-year-old girl.

"Hair-loss drug under lens over threat to infants, eye disorders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hair-loss-drug-under-lens-over-threat-to-infants-eye-disorders/articleshow/126195368.cms,"AI image

NEW DELHI: Minoxidil, a widely used over-the-counter drug to treat hair loss, has been linked to unintended exposure in infants and a large number of eye-related side effects, according to a global safety analysis that has flagged dozens of baby-related cases and more than 1,600 eye disorder reports worldwide.Researchers identified more than 45 reports of excessive hair growth in infants aged up to 23 months linked to exposure to minoxidil. In several cases, exposure was not due to direct application but occurred unintentionally within the household, including contact with caregivers or contaminated surfaces.Globally, the analysis found 2,664 suspected cases of excessive hair growth linked to minoxidil use during pregnancy. Among infant cases, maternal exposure accounted for 22.2%, accidental exposure for 44.4%, while the route of exposure was unclear in 33.3% of cases.Though no infant cases were reported from India, the authors of the study cautioned that this likely reflected under-reporting rather than absence of risk, given the drug's widespread use.The study also raised concerns about eye health. A total of 1,660 reports of eye-related adverse effects associated with minoxidil use were recorded globally, including 25 reports from India.Frequently reported problems included eyelid swelling and blurred vision.More serious eye conditions were also noted, including central serous chorioretinopathy. After removal of duplicate reports, four serious eye cases remained - three involving central serous chorioretinopathy and one case of retinal artery occlusion.The findings are based on a post-marketing safety analysis of adverse drug reports submitted to VigiBase, the global drug safety database maintained by WHO, covering data up to March 2025.The study was authored by Dr V Kalaiselvan and Dr Jaishree Suresh of the Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission, health ministry, and Dr Rohit Saxena of the Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, AIIMS.Minoxidil was originally developed as an oral medicine to treat high blood pressure. Hair growth was later observed as a side effect, leading to its reformulation as a topical drug used to treat hair loss. Its effectiveness against androgenetic alopecia has since made it one of the most commonly used treatments worldwide.The authors warned easy over-the-counter availability, aggressive online promotion and limited counselling had allowed use to expand faster than safety awareness, particularly among pregnant women and households with infants.The study underlined that minoxidil was contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but awareness of this warning remained low. With topical formulations commonly used at home, unintentional exposure through skin contact or household surfaces may place infants at risk.Calling for action, the authors recommended clearer warning labels, stricter oversight of over-the-counter sales and routine counselling by pharmacists and healthcare providers.Caregivers were advised to store products safely and avoid use around infants and pregnant women.While minoxidil continues to benefit adults using it to treat hair loss, the authors stressed public awareness and pharmacovigilance must keep pace with growing use to prevent avoidable adverse effects.","Minoxidil, a widely used over-the-counter drug to treat hair loss, has been linked to unintended exposure in infants and eye-related side effects.

Amit Shah’s 'Tamil Apology' In Focus As Stalin Speaks Tamil Without Apology In Bihar

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: People's Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti on Friday lost her cool with a journalist who asked her to speak in Urdu instead of Kashmiri, which the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister was using at the time.As soon as she began her press conference in Kashmiri at the PDP headquarters in Srinagar, a journalist asked her to speak in Urdu.“Do you want a translation? Why? Translate it. Why don’t you ask Stalin to speak in English or Urdu?” Mufti snapped, referring to Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin, who speaks only Tamil, his native language.She further urged Kashmiri journalists to “show some respect” for their language.“This is the only thing that is left now, so respect the Kashmiri language a little,” the former chief minister said, before continuing her address in her mother tongue.Mufti also spoke about the lynching of two Hindu youths in separate incidents in neighbouring Bangladesh, drawing a parallel with the ""intolerant"" situation in India.“The intolerance in the entire country has increased. Lynchings are taking place.What is happening in Bangladesh pains us, but those who criticise it remain mute spectators when lynchings take place here,” she told reporters.The PDP chief further urged the Jammu and Kashmir government to send ministerial teams to various states to ensure the ""safety"" of Kashmiris living there.""Our government should send a ministerial team to every state and especially to Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Haryana, where most such incidents take place,"" she said.Mufti's remark came in the wake of an alleged assault on a shawl seller from the Union territory in Uttarakhand. She also took credit for the arrest of the accused.""I immediately put out a tweet and tagged the Uttarakhand DGP, seeking his intervention. That is why the accused was arrested. There are still some officers in the police who respond. But three incidents took place in 72 hours? In Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana.

SRINAGAR: A day after National Conference (NC) MP from Srinagar, Aga Ruhullah Mehdi, said he would stage a protest outside J&K CM Omar Abdullah ’s residence over government’s failure to rationalise reservation policy, the party on Friday accused him of acting at the behest of central govt and asked him to resign if he remained unwilling to align with NC’s policies.“He (Mehdi) has friends in New Delhi and is acting on their behalf. This is New Delhi’s doing. Instead of blaming the J&K govt, he should ask his friends in New Delhi to ensure that the file on rationalisation of reservations, cleared by the J&K govt and forwarded by it to the lieutenant governor for approval, is still in LG’s office. Let him get it cleared from there,” said minister for jal shakti, forest and tribal affairs Javed Ahmad Rana.“Instead of protesting outside the LG’s residence or office, he is planning to protest against the popular govt that has already decided the matter. This is not morally correct,” Rana said. “We have done our job. It is now for the LG to act on it.”He also took a swipe at Mehdi, saying that many people who spend time in Delhi start moving in influential circles and then begin to “punch above their weight”.He said, “The Srinagar MP has caught the same infection. He believes he has become bigger than he is, but our party’s long experience shows that Delhi infection does not work in Jammu and Kashmir .”","National conference (nc) mp from srinagar, aga ruhullah mehdi, said he would stage a protest outside j&k cm omar abdullah ’s residence.

Kerala gets its first BJP mayor: Is the 'red fortress' collapsing?

Will the 'red fortresses' collapse?



NEW DELHI: Kerala got its first BJP mayor, VV Rajesh, after the National Democratic Alliance won Thiruvananthapuram civic body elections, marking an end to 45 years of Left Democratic Front's (LDF) rule in the city.Thiruvananthapuram was treated like ""inherited property under Left–Congress dominance for decades,"" said state BJP general secretary Anoop Antony Joseph.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had already hailed the saffron wave in the red-dominated region as a ""watershed moment"", saying: “Thank you Thiruvananthapuram! The mandate the BJP-NDA got in the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation is a watershed moment in Kerala’s politics.”In Kollam corporation, UDF’s AK Hafeez was elected mayor, while Kochi saw four-time councillor VK Minimol assume the mayor’s post. Thrissur also went the UDF’s way with Dr Niji Justin elected mayor, though the result was accompanied by internal dissent after councillor Lali James alleged she was sidelined following bribery by party leaders. In Kannur too, the UDF strengthened its position, with P Indira set to take charge as mayor.One of the standout moments of the results came from Pala municipality, where 21-year-old Diya Binu Pulikkankandam was elected chairperson with UDF backing, becoming the youngest municipal chairperson in Kerala. Diya, along with her father Binu and uncle Biju, won as Independents before extending support to the UDF — a move that ended Kerala Congress (Mani)’s long-standing dominance in Pala, once considered its political citadel.The NDA, meanwhile, posted selective but symbolically significant gains. The BJP retained control of Thiruvananthapuram and also emerged victorious in the municipalities of Tripunithura and Palakkad, underlining its expanding footprint in urban local bodies. While the LDF managed to hold its ground in Kozhikode by winning the majority of wards, it secured only one of the six corporations overall.As the CPI(M) looks ahead to the 2026 Kerala Assembly election, it does so from a position of growing vulnerability. A strong wave of anti-incumbency and governance fatigue has begun to weigh on the Left after a decade in office.These fault lines were evident not just in the local body polls, but also in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The Left struggled badly at the national level even as the Congress regained momentum in the state and the BJP carved out space in what was long considered a near one-party arena. The parliamentary contests exposed a shrinking footprint for the Left beyond state politics.In both the 2019 and 2024 general elections, the CPI(M) won only a handful of Kerala’s 20 Lok Sabha seats, while the Congress-led UDF dominated and the BJP managed to open its account. This contrast has underscored a weakening appeal in national elections, even as the Left retains power in Thiruvananthapuram. That control was reaffirmed in 2021, when the LDF secured a decisive Assembly victory and achieved the rare feat of a second consecutive term in Kerala.

The student was then taken to the principal.The principal called the girl's parents to the school, and her father arrived shortly afterwards. He alleged that even in his presence, the teachers and principal continued to scold and insult the student aggressively.

The principal told TOI over the phone that the student was not harassed and that the school followed standard protocol prescribed by the Central Board of Secondary Education . ""The girl was found with a mobile phone during the pre-board examinations. When the invigilator checked the device, it appeared that she had been using AI to get answers. The phone was confiscated, and she was brought to the examination head, who then brought her to me,"" the principal said.She said she had informed the student that using such methods during the CBSE board examinations could lead to a ban of up to five years from appearing in the exams. ""That is the rule, and the child was only told about the consequences,"" she said. According to the principal, the student's parents were informed immediately and reached the school within 10 to 15 minutes, as they lived nearby. She said the interaction took place at the reception area and was brief.","A class 10 student died by suicide early on dec 23, allegedly hours after she was pulled up by her teachers and principal at a private greater noida west school.
