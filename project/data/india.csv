The review was in continuation of the meeting chaired by Shah on Tuesday, in which the Chief of Army Staff, General Upendra Dwivedi, was present, among others.The back-to-back meetings by Shah came close on the heels of a terror attack in south Kashmir’s Kulgam district, which had killed ex-serviceman Manzoor Ahmad Wagay, apart from injuring his wife and another relative.Stating that the Narendra Modi government is committed to completely wiping out terrorism from J&K, Shah said the sustained and coordinated efforts in this direction over the past 10 years have significantly weakened the terrorism ecosystem. He exhorted the security agencies to stay focused on taking stringent action against infiltrators and terrorists, including those engaged in terror financing . “Our goal should be to uproot the existence of terrorists,” Shah told the meeting.The home minister directed the agencies to make new appointments in the posts of Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) in view of the timely implementation of the new criminal laws.Recalling the Modi government's ‘policy of zero tolerance against terrorism’ to achieve the goal of a terrorism-free Jammu and Kashmir, Shah directed all security agencies to remain vigilant and continue to work in synergy to eliminate terrorism from the UT.“The Union home minister appreciated the efforts of the security agencies for significant improvement in all parameters of the security scenario in Jammu and Kashmir,” said a release issued by the home ministry after Wednesday’s review.",Home minister amit shah asked security forces and agencies to counter infiltration and acts of terror in jammu and kashmir with a ruthless approach.

AAP rejects exit poll numbers

NEW DELHI: The BJP is likely to make a strong comeback in Delhi after 27 long years with most exit polls predicting majority for the saffron party and a shock defeat for the AAP which could end Arvind Kejriwal 's 10-year dream run in politics. The poll of exit polls gives clear majority to the BJP which is predicted to win 43 seats while the AAP may end up a distant second with only 26 seats. The majority mark in the 70-member Delhi assembly is 36.The Congress, which is fighting a battle for survival in Delhi, may finally open its account in the assembly winning 1 seat. In the last two assembly elections, the Congress could not win any seat.All exit polls except two have predicted BJP victory in Delhi.

"Delhi elections exit polls: Poll of polls predict shock AAP exit, return of BJP to Delhi after 27 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-elections-exit-polls-poll-of-polls-predict-shock-aap-exit-return-of-bjp-to-delhi-after-27-years/articleshow/117953759.cms,"Several exit polls conducted on Wednesday forecasted a win for the BJP over the ruling AAP in the Delhi assembly elections, while Congress was expected to gain little compared to previous elections. However, two exit polls indicated a potential victory for AAP, with several others suggesting a tight race favouring the BJP.A poll of polls suggests that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will regain power after 27 years, with predictions suggesting it may secure around 40 seats in the 70-member assembly. This would allow them to surpass the majority mark of 36 seats required to form a government.In contrast, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which has held power for two consecutive full terms, is forecasted to win approximately 30 seats. Meanwhile, the Congress party is expected to struggle significantly, with projections indicating they may secure only 0 to 1 seat.The Election Commission will release official results following the counting on February 8. Exit polls are predictions made by election survey agencies based on voter interviews immediately after they cast their votes, but they can differ significantly from actual outcomes. In the 2020 Delhi elections, many exit polls miscalculated their forecasts.Among those predicting a BJP victory, People's Pulse estimated that the NDA could secure between 51 and 60 seats, while AAP might obtain 10-19 seats, with Congress failing to win any. People's Insight suggested the NDA would get 40-44 seats, AAP 25-29 seats, and Congress 0-1 seat. The P-Marq poll projected 39-49 seats for BJP and allies, 21-31 for AAP, and 0-1 for Congress. JVC's exit poll indicated BJP and allies would achieve 39-45 seats, AAP 22-31 seats, and Congress 0-2. Poll Diary anticipated 42-50 seats for BJP and allies, while assigning AAP 18-25 seats and Congress 0-2. Chanakya Strategies forecasted BJP and allies at 39-44 seats, AAP at 25-28, and Congress at 2-3.Two surveys predicted AAP's success: Wee Preside estimated AAP at 46-52 seats against BJP's 18-23 and Congress's 0-1; Mind Brink Media projected AAP at 44-49 seats with BJP at 21-25 and Congress at 0-1.Matrize suggested a close contest with BJP-led NDA at 35-40 seats and AAP at 32-37, giving Congress 0-1 seats.DV Research anticipated AAP would secure between 26-34 seats while BJP and allies would get 36-44, again predicting zero for Congress.In the Delhi assembly of 70 members, a majority requires 36 seats. Currently, AAP holds 62 MLAs, BJP has eight, and Congress has none. The assembly elections took place on Wednesday, with results due on February 8. Approximately 58% of Delhi's 1.55 crore voters participated by 5pm on Wednesday.Several AAP leaders dismissed the exit polls' predictions, while BJP officials expressed confidence in their anticipated victory.The political dynamics in Delhi have shifted dramatically since the rise of AAP in 2013, which disrupted Congress's long-standing dominance in the region. The last two elections saw AAP winning decisively, with substantial majorities. However, recent trends suggest that voter sentiment may be changing, possibly influenced by various factors including governance issues and allegations of corruption against AAP leaders.Historically, exit polls have had mixed accuracy in predicting outcomes in Delhi elections. For instance, while they correctly anticipated AAP's victories in previous elections, they often underestimated the scale of those wins. In 2015 and 2020, exit polls projected closer contests than what ultimately transpired.","The bharatiya janata party (bjp) is forecasted to win around 40 seats. This would allow them to surpass the majority mark of 36 seats required to form a government.

PATNA: Bihar deputy chief minister Vijay Sinha on Wednesday launched a scathing attack on Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor Arvind Kejriwal , claiming that the AAP chief brought in an ""era of fraudism"" in Delhi.""If anyone has brought the era of fraudism, then his name is Arvind Kejriwal. He does not believe in the constitution nor does he believe in constitutional institutions,"" Bihar deputy CM said.Adding that Kejriwal flip-flops between ""arrogance"" and ""discrediting constitutional institutions."" Deputy CM Sinha said, ""When this person (Arvind Kejriwal) wins the election. So he will sing his celebratory song in his arrogance. When he loses, he will stigmatize and discredit the constitutional institution and such people are not friendly to the nation. Punjab is an example of this.""His remarks come amidst Kejriwal's alleging on February 4 that the election commission and the Delhi Police are supporting hooliganism against AAP and protecting the BJP 's wrongdoing.Kejriwal took to social media to express his outrage, stating that the ECI and Delhi Police are working together to disrupt the electoral process and favour the BJP and claimed that their primary focus is to engage in hooliganism, protect the interests of BJP and distribute liquor and money.Meanwhile, voting in the Delhi Assembly elections concluded on Wednesday at 6 pm in all 11 districts of the national capital territory.The Bihar deputy CM also hit out at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi , while Gandhi is on a visit to Patna.Deputy CM Sinha claimed that just like Congress is being ""wiped out"" from the country, they will be defeated in the upcoming Bihar Assembly election too.""Today was Rahul Gandhi's visit. They (Congress) are being wiped from all over the country. In Bihar too, they are afraid...they discredited the word Bihari and abused the word Bihari with the same group of people. They cannot provoke the people of Bihar,"" Sinha said.During his visit to Patna, Gandhi accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of tokenism in Dalit representation .He claimed that while Dalits are being given representation, they are being denied any real power in decision-making processes.""In India's power structure today, whether it is education, health, corporate, business, judiciary, how much is your participation?... Dalits have been given representation but it means nothing if there is no participation in the power structure. Making you sit on the stage has no meaning if the decisions are made from behind the stage. Today, it has become a fashion to give tickets to people from different castes, PM Modi also did this,"" Rahul Gandhi said during his programme in Patna, on the occasion of Jaglal Choudhary Jayanti.But then, you (PM Modi) snatched the powers of the MLAs. Even the Lok Sabha MPs have no power to make any decisions. You made ministers but the officer on special duty (OSD) is from Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).

NEW DELHI: Delhi on Wednesday votes for the assembly elections, with more than 1.5 crore eligible voters hitting the poll button to decide the national capital's politcal fate.A total of 699 candidates: 603 men, 95 women, and one third-gender candidate, are contesting for 70 assembly seats, after 2 weeks of intense campaigning.The polling booths opened at 7 am and voting will continue till 6 pm across 13,766 polling stations spread over 2,696 locations.This high stake contest will witness the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) striving to retain its power in the region that it has dominated for the last two terms, against its rivals, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress.Congress is also looking to achieve a strong comeback after a decade long exile from the capital.Many constituencies are set for fierce battles this time. AAP chief and former CM Arvind Kejriwal faces a tough challenge from BJP's Parvesh Verma and Congress's Sandeep Dikshit, both of whom are former MPs from different constituencies.Meanwhile, CM Atishi is up against BJP’s Ramesh Bidhuri, also a former MP, alongside Congress’s Alka Lamba.Aam Aadmi Party has pledged to expand its welfare schemes, offering free electricity and water, free bus travel for women, and improved education and healthcare, which it claims would save families around Rs 25,000 a month. It has also promised a monthly honorarium of Rs 2,100 for eligible women, free medical treatment for senior citizens, and free bus travel for students.BJP, hoping to break its 30-year drought in Delhi assembly elections, has vowed to continue existing welfare schemes while introducing new ones, including a Rs 2,500 monthly stipend for women, increased pensions for senior citizens, Ayushman Bharat benefits, a monthly pension for small traders, paid internships for youth, and gas cylinders at Rs 500 for low-income households.Congress is attempting to reclaim a share of its traditional voter base from AAP and has promised Rs 8,500 per month for unemployed youth for a year, Rs 2,500 per month for women under the 'Pyari Didi Yojana,' an annual insurance cover of Rs 25 lakh, and zero electricity bills for consumers using up to 300 units.The Delhi election office has pledged to ensure a “free and fair” poll in the city. Delhi’s chief electoral officer R Alice Vaz informed that 1.1 civil officials- polling teams, counting staff, flying squad, sector magistrates, expenditure monitors, control room officials, micro observers and volunteers, along with a pool of 60,000 security personnel have been deployed to achieve the purpose.Approximately 82.7 lakh men and 72.4 women will be casting their vote on Wednesday for whom 21,584 ballot units, more than 20,000 control units and 18,943 VVPAT machines have been set up.Vas further added that all the voters standing in the queue at 6 pm would be allowed to cast their vote.Exit polls are surveys conducted immediately after voters leave polling stations. They aim to predict the outcome of the elections before the official results are declared.However, the election commission has banned releasing exit polls till 6:30 pm on Wednesday, the day of voting. The ban applies to the Delhi elections and bypolls in Uttar Pradesh’s Milkipur constituency and Tamil Nadu’s Erode (East) seat. Citing Section 126A(1) of the R P Act, 1951, the notification stated, “The period between 7am and 6:30pm on 05.02.2025 (Wednesday) is hereby notified as the duration during which conducting, publishing, or publicising exit polls by any means, including print or electronic media, shall be prohibited.”According to the election commission, the exit poll results would be released after 6.30 pm on February 5.The exit poll predictions of 2025 Delhi assembly elections will be live streamed on different news channels, social media platforms, and YouTube channels.The result of the Delhi assembly elections would be announced on Satuday, 8th February.","Polling booths opened at 7 am and voting will continue till 6 pm across 13,766 polling stations spread over 2,696 locations.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/latest-income-tax-slabs-2025-26-how-much-tax-do-individuals-earning-slightly-above-rs-12-lakh-have-to-pay-marginal-relief-calculations-explained/articleshow/117911656.cms,"Budget 2025 income tax: The total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs. 12,75,000/-.

According to the Income Tax Department, in the new tax regime under section 115BAC(1A), marginal relief is available to resident individuals who have taxable income marginally above Rs 12 lakh. The total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs 12,75,000/-.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How is the marginal relief computed?

First the tax as per slab rate is computed on the total income. For e.g. tax on the total income of Rs. 12,10,000/-shall be computed in following steps:

Tax payable on total income of Rs. 12,00,000/- on which rebate is available is Nil.

Now, the tax liability without marginal relief (in this case Rs. 61,500) shall be compared with the amount exceeding total income up to which rebate is available [in this case Rs 10,000, [i.e. Rs.12,10,000- Rs. 12,00,000]

The marginal relief shall be computed by deducting the income exceeding Rs 12, 10,000 (i.e. Rs.10,000) from total tax liability determined in this case (i.e. Rs. 61,500).

Therefore, in this case rebate by way of marginal relief is Rs 51,500 (61,500/- 10,000/-= 51,500/-) is allowed.

Tax payable is therefore Rs 10,000 [Rs 61,500-Rs 51,500]

For income of Rs 12,50,000, the tax liability reduces from Rs 67,500 to Rs 50,000 with marginal relief.

At Rs 12,70,000 income level, the tax obligation decreases marginally from Rs 70,500 to Rs 70,000 with the relief provision.

At Rs 12,75,000 income, the tax payable is Rs 71,250, and marginal relief becomes inapplicable.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26 post Budget 2025: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced ZERO or NIL tax liability for individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh in the Union Budget 2025 under the new income tax regime. For salaried individuals, including the standard deduction, this limit is Rs 12.75 lakh under the new regime.But what about individuals with taxable income slightly above Rs 12 lakh? Will they have to pay more income tax than their additional earnings above Rs 12 lakh? Will someone earning Rs 12,10,000 face a Rs 61,500 tax burden versus an individual earning Rs 10,000 less who will pay nothing?There's good news! Here's where the concept of marginal relief comes us. Individuals with income slightly above Rs 12 lakh, which is the nil tax threshold, will receive fair treatment through marginal tax relief.For example, for a person having income of Rs 12, 10,000/-, in the absence of marginal relief, the tax works out to be Rs 61,500/- (5% of Rs 4 lakh + 10% of 4 lakh and 15% of Rs 10,000). However, due to marginal relief, the amount of tax to be actually paid is Rs 10,000/-)Also Read | Income Tax slabs 2025-26: How you can pay ZERO tax with Rs 13.7 lakh salary under new income tax regime The marginal relief is computed in the following manner:-Marginal relief examples:It's important to note that rebate is offered to individuals with taxable income up to Rs 12 lakh under the new tax regime. This is different from marginal relief for taxpayers whose earnings slightly exceed Rs 12 lakh.

Anonymous US officials were quoted as saying dozens had been deported, and unconfirmed reports put the number of deportees north of 200, but there was no confirmation about the same by either country.In fact, there was no official acknowledgement at all of the flight by Indian authorities till late in the evening. The American embassy here, without sharing any details about the flight, said the US is vigorously enforcing its border, tightening immigration laws, and removing illegal migrants. “These actions send a clear message: illegal migration is not worth the risk,” said the spokesperson.Official sources here said India’s position on illegal migration had not changed and it will continue to accept those who illegally entered the US, after verifying their Indian origin. The people who are returning, all verified Indian nationals, are among the thousands of Indians identified for deportation under the Biden administration.An early morning report by Reuters from Washington said the C-17 aircraft had departed for India with migrants aboard but would not arrive for at least 24 hours. The Punjab government was preparing for its landing in Amritsar on Wednesday morning. The Indian government did not confirm if the plane was going to land there but American journalists quoted US officials as saying that the aircraft was on its way to the Indian border city after a stop in Guam.The development also comes days ahead of PM Narendra Modi’s visit to the US for his first bilateral meeting with Trump since the latter’s inauguration on January 20. Trump had raised the issue of illegal migration with Modi and later said the India PM would do what’s right on the issue.While India has been accepting illegal migrants from the US for years, including under the first Trump administration, it has rarely, if ever, used a military aircraft to deport Indian nationals to India. The last time US authorities deported a significant number of illegals to India was in October last year but that was carried out through a large frame charter flight. Colombia recently turned away 2 US military deportation aircraft, saying the US was treating its nationals like criminals, but quickly backed down after Trump threatened to retaliate with punitive trade tariffs.While India is unlikely to be as sensitive as some of the Leftist Latin American leaders about receiving citizens in a military aircraft from the US, a country it has robust defence cooperation with, the Indian government will closely follow how Indian nationals returning are handled by American authorities in deportation flights. This is also the farthest that a US deportation plane has travelled since Trump’s return as such flights were limited till now to central and South American countries. Many of these illegal migrants were reported to have landed in their respective countries in handcuffs. While Mexico has insisted on accepting its citizens only in civilian planes, Brazil complained about “flagrant disregard’’ of human rights in US deportation flights.A New York Times report on January 3, quoting defence officials, said military planes have rarely been used in the past by the US for deportation. Most deportations in the past couple of weeks have been through nonmilitary planes and only 6 military flights have been used for the same till the end of Trump’s second week in office. Guatemala, Honduras, Ecuador and Peru are the only countries to have received military flights till the end of the last week.","The us despatched a c17 military aircraft carrying an unspecified number of illegal indian migrants to india.
