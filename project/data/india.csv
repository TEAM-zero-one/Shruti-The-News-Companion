NDA partners tussle over who’ll contest which seat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nda-partners-tussle-over-wholl-contest-which-seat/articleshow/124541132.cms,"PATNA: Allies BJP and JD(U) withheld Monday the breakup of constituencies allotted to NDA partners in Bihar, fuelling murmurs of discontent over seat distribution and CM Nitish Kumar’s party having to settle for an equal share of the electoral pie with its saffron partner for the first time.Talks involving BJP state chief Dilip Jaiswal, deputy CM Samrat Choudhary, ministers Nitin Nabin and Vijay Choudhary, and JD(U)’s Sanjay Kumar Jha failed to break the deadlock over what insiders said was a tussle for highstakes seats, reports Jai Na-rain Pandey . Dinara MLA Jai Kumar Singh quit JD(U) after his seat was given to RLM. NDA officially maintains seat deal ‘amicable’I never imagined it would come to this, Dinara MLA Jai Kumar Singh said, indicating he may contest the seat as an Independent.NDA functionaries officially maintained that seat-sharing agreement was “amicable” and that BJP and JDU each getting 101 seats was never an issue. Deputy CM Samrat Choudhary mentioned Jitan Ram Manjhi’s HAM(S), calling him NDA’s “guardian” in Bihar and insisting he was happy with the six seats allocated to his party.Union minister Chirag Paswan’s LJP(RV) drove a hard bargain with BJP for 29 seats. But the deal is still far from done.He wants Govindganj from BJP and Matihani in Begusarai from JDU. RLM, like HAM(S), will field candidates in six seats.BJP’s state election in-charge, Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, is in Patna for further talks to tie up the loose ends as the clock ticks on the process of filing nomination papers for the Nov 11 second phase of polls.Amid speculation about tussle within NDA for specific seats intensifying, BJP’s Giriraj Singh harked back to the 2010 polls outcome & wrote on X, “NDA created history in 2010 Bihar polls. Won 206 out of 243 seats! JDU won 115 out of 141 seats... strike rate 81%. BJP won 91 out of 102 seats... strike rate 89%... Pradhan was in-charge then & remains in-charge today.”RLM chief Kushwaha fell back on poetry to suggest not everything is hunky-dory. “Aaj baadalon ne phir saazish ki, jahaan mera ghar tha wahin baarish ki. Agar falak ko zid hai bijliyaan giraane ki, to hamein bhi zid hai wahin par aashiyaan basaane ki (Today, the clouds conspired again, rained where my home was. If the sky is adamant on striking lightning, I am also adamant on building a home there),” he said, apologising to his supporters for not being able to contest more seats.Manjhi faced dissent in HAM(S) over Romit Singh being fielded in Atri constituency and the party accepting one seat less than in 2020. “I will try to convince our party workers, who are undoubtedly disappointed,” he said. LJP (RV) MP Shambhavi Choudhary said his party’s target was to “maintain our performance in 29 seats we got”. He reminded everyone that Chirag’s party won LS polls “with a 100% strike rate”.",Nda functionaries officially maintain seat-sharing agreement was ‘amicable’ dinara mla jai kumar singh quit jd(u) after his seat was given to rlm.

NEW DELHI: A 31-member committee formed in the Haryana IPS officer Y Puran Kumar's alleged suicide case suicide, on Sunday, gave the Chandigarh administration and Haryana government 48 hours to remove state police chief Shatrujeet Kapur.Kapur is among the officers named by Kumar’s wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, for allegedly abetting her husband’s suicide.The committee made this demand during a mahapanchayat in Chandigarh on Sunday. Heavy police were deployed around the venue.“The Haryana DGP and former Rohtak SP should be arrested. The DGP must be removed from his post. We have given 48 hours, after which we will decide the next course of action,” a committee spokesperson told reporters, as quoted by news agency PTI.Six days have passed since Kumar, who was last posted as IG at the Police Training Centre in Rohtak’s Sunaria, died. His post-mortem and cremation have not been conducted, as the family is refusing consent until their demands are met.The mahapanchayat saw tension when former Haryana MP Raj Kumar Saini reportedly made a controversial remark, sparking anger among attendees. Calm was restored after organisers intervened.A message from Kumar’s family was read, appealing for support in their pursuit of justice. Committee members also demanded a judicial probe into the case, said Gurmail Singh, a committee member. “The family and dalit community fear that if the last rites are conducted, the government may not take action against the accused,” said Karamvir, a committee member. He also questioned the work done by the Special Investigation Team set up by Chandigarh police.Fifty-two-year-old Kumar, a 2001-batch IPS officer, allegedly shot himself at his Chandigarh home on October 7. In an eight-page note reportedly left behind, he named eight senior officers, including DGP Kapur and former Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya, accusing them of harassment and tarnishing his image. The note also mentioned caste-based discrimination.The Haryana government has transferred Bijarniya, replacing him with IPS officer Surinder Singh Bhoria.In her complaint to Chandigarh Police, Amneet P Kumar sought an FIR against Kapur and Bijarniya under Section 108 (abetment of suicide) and relevant provisions of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, demanding their arrest. She also requested amendments to the FIR to include all accused officers’ names.Haryana ministers and senior officials, including chief secretary Anurag Rastogi, recently met the family to persuade them to agree to the post-mortem and cremation.","Y puran kumar allegedly shot himself at his chandigarh home on october 7.

Poll Do you agree with Mamata Banerjee's remarks on the Durgapur gangrape case? Yes, she is right to call out the authorities. No, victim-blaming is not acceptable.

NEW DELHI: Union minister Kiren Rijiju , highlighting West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee 's ""victim-blaming"" remark on the Durgapur gangrape case, singled out the ""illiberal gang"" for being conspicuously silent on the matter.While taking the authorities of a private medical college in Durgapur to task for the circumstances leading to the alleged gang rape of a student late on Friday, Mamata Banerjee said that allowing a girl to step out of a campus ""located in a forested area"" past midnight is ""shocking"".""How did they (the girl and a male friend) come out of the campus at 12.30 am? Wasn't it the responsibility of the college? I don't know why they were allowed to leave at that hour,"" she said in her first reaction to the crime involving the second-year MBBS student from Odisha.""Imagine, if this statement was made by a BJP Chief Minister! The whole echo-system and self declared liberal journalists (actually illiberal gang) would have created unbearable situation in the country [sic],"" said Union parliamentary minister Kiren Rijiju.CM Banerjee, who had to contend with a public uproar and a prolonged doctors' agitation after August 2024 rape-murder of a medical resident studying for her PG at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, said it isn't possible for cops to be present everywhere at all times of the day.She urged students from other states to be ""careful and not venture out of campuses in forested areas late at night"" since they might be unfamiliar with the local terrain.Mamata's remarks coincided with the arrest of three suspects in the Durgapur case. The survivor's male friend is being detained for further interrogation. ""No one (linked with the crime) will be spared,"" the CM said, adding, ""Cops are searching for everyone involved. All the guilty will be punished strictly.""A classmate of the survivor and another man have been detained for quizzing.

CHANDIGARH: In a late-night development, the Haryana government has sent Director General of Police (DGP) Shatrujeet Kapur on leave amid the controversy surrounding the death of senior IPS officer Y Puran Kumar, who had named Kapur in his suicide note. The decision has come just a day before the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi was to visit the victim officer's family.The decision comes following a tense standoff, with the family of the deceased officer refusing to allow the autopsy or cremation of the body until Kapur was removed from his post. Rajiv Jaitly, media adviser to CM Haryana confirmed the development over phone. However, the official order was not released till the filing of this report.Y. Puran Kumar, a senior Haryana cadre 2001 cadre IPS officer, had committed suicide on October 7 leaving behind a detailed eight page suicide note in which he had name DGP Kapur triggering widespread outrage and demands for action.The state government on Saturday transferred another IPS officer, Narendra Bijrania, who was also accused by the deceased cop for harassing him along with Kapur, from the post of SP Rohtak.In his “final note”, Kumar accused several senior officers, including Kapur and Bijarniya, of harassment and caste-based discrimination, which he claimed contributed to his distress. A total of 16 officers including IAS and IPS were named by Kumar before taking the extreme step.The dead body of the deceased cop is lying in mortuary, as the deceased's wife P Amneet Kumar, who is also a 2001 batch IAS officer, has been demanding action against Kapur. The Haryana IAS officers association had also appealed to the Chandigarh administration and the Haryana government to take appropriate action on Amneet’s complaint filed with the Chandigarh Police on Wednesday and her representation given to the Haryana CM. In her complaint, Amneet alleged that her husband had endured “years of systematic humiliation, harassment, and persecution” at the hands of senior officials, particularly DGP Shatrujeet Singh Kapur.On Sunday, a ‘Mahapanchayat’ (congregation) was also organized in Chandigarh by 31-Member Committee fighting for justice to Puran Kumar’s family in which a 48-hour ultimatum has been given to the Chandigarh Administration and the Haryana government. The deadline was to end on Tuesday.The primary demand of the committee was immediate removal of Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur from his post within 48 hours.In a rare gesture, the Haryana governor Aseem Kumar Ghosh had also visited the deceased officer's family on Sunday to offer condolences.On October 9, the Chandigarh police had registered an FIR against ""all those named in the final note"" on charges of abetment to suicide and sections of SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act. The original FIR had invoked section 3(1)(r) of the Act, which provides for a jail term of a minimum six months, extendable to five years, and a fine. Apart from this, the police had also charged the accused under section 108 of BNS for abetting suicide, which provides for a maximum sentence of 10 years.In the FIR’s column, which provides details of accused/suspect, the FIR had referred all those mentioned in deceased officer’s suicide note including around 16 senior IPS/IAS officers with specific allegations against Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur and the then Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarnia. However, on October 12, the Chandigarh police amended the FIR to include Section 3(2)(v) of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, which provides a punishment of life imprisonment and a fine if the offence is found to be motivated by the victim’s caste.",Haryana dgp shatrujeet kapur sent on leave amid controversy surrounding the death of senior ips officer y puran kumar.

"Lalu IRCTC scam 'fountainhead', says court as it frames charges",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lalu-irctc-scam-fountainhead-says-court-as-it-frames-charges/articleshow/124538106.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Delhi court framed Monday charges against former railway minister Lalu Prasad , his wife Rabri Devi, son Tejashwi Yadav , and 11 others in the alleged IRCTC scam that rigged railway hotel contracts for favoured private players.Rabri and Tejashwi prima facie emerge as participants in the criminal conspiracy of which Lalu Prasad was seemingly the ""fountainhead"", Special Judge Vishal Gogne said. The ""individual strands of the cheating"" between 2005 and 2014 were ""intrinsically interwoven"" with a larger network of collusion among multiple accused, he added.According to CBI , when Lalu was railway minister between 2004 and 2014, two BNR Hotels of railways - in Ranchi and Puri - were first transferred to IRCTC and then leased to Patna-based Sujata Hotels through a manipulated tender process. In return, land parcels in Patna were allegedly transferred at undervalued rates to Lalu's family through firms linked to the hotel owners. Investigators allege this quid pro quo formed the heart of the scam. CBI registered the FIR on July 5, 2017, and filed its charge sheet in April 2018. Court took cognisance of the final report on July 30, 2018, and prosecution sanction followed in July 2020.Those named in the charge sheet include former IRCTC group general managers VK Asthana and RK Goyal, and Sujata Hotels directors Vijay and Vinay Kochhar, who also own Patna's Chanakya Hotel.Two firms - Sujata Hotels and Delight Marketing Company (now LARA Projects LLP) - are among the accused.""You conspired for the undervalued purchase of land parcels. You conspired with other accused for the subsequent transfer of effective control over these land parcels to Rabri Devi and Tejashwi Yadav,"" Judge Gogne said while pronouncing the order. All accused, including the Yadav family, were present in court. The court said the transfer of land to Lalu's wife and son by ""commercial players"" suggested ""an instance of crony capitalism fostered in the guise of eliciting private participation"" in the operation of railway hotels. ""This conspiracy may be sublime but not entirely hidden from the court's view,"" the judge said.Judge Gogne said CBI had presented a ""cogent chain of evidence"" linking the accused, adding that the agency ""was possibly led by the stench to the rot"". He described Lalu's ""institutional awareness and possible intervention"" as the ""glue"" binding the conspiracy, calling the alleged quid pro quo ""a principal conspiracy among multiple persons"" from the start.Concluding that there was ""adequate substantiation"" of the allegations, the judge said the criminal conspiracy alleged by CBI is ""the thread"" connecting all accused - marking the start of trial proceedings in one of the country's most politically charged corruption cases.","Rabri and tejashwi prima facie emerge as participants in criminal conspiracy.

The message was sent to the Congress interlocutors as the opposition had been dragging its feet on names for the panel despite repeated reminders.The sole holdout, CPM , also gave its nod to the boycott on Monday after Congress reached out to persuade the Left ally.CPM MP John Brittas told TOI, ""We are for opposition unity. In that spirit, we are with other opposition parties on the issue of JPC.""While major anti-BJP parties headed by Congress were earlier keen to join the JPC, an uncompromising Trinamool Congress queered the pitch for the INDIA bloc by announcing in Aug that it would boycott the panel. It then drew support from SP, AAP and Shiv Sena.They argued that parliamentary panels were being used by the Modi government to bulldoze bills without considering the views of the opposition, citing the example of the Waqf Bill.

SC: Karur case has shaken nat'l conscience, deserves fair probe

NEW DELHI: Noting that the Karur stampede in Tamil Nadu shook ""national conscience"" and the case has ""political undertone"", Supreme Court Monday decided to hand over the probe into the tragedy to CBI & also appointed a three-member panel headed by its former judge Ajay Rastogi to supervise the investigation.Questioning the fairness of the investigation, a bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and N V Anjaria noted that top state police officials had made a statement that their subordinates were not at fault and said, ""Prima facie, this fact in itself creates a doubt in the minds of the public about the independence and impartiality of the investigation.""The families of those who died and got injured are in the doldrums and what they want is a free and fair probe, with the political tussle over the stampede being of little solace to them.The incident of Karur stampede has definitely left an imprint in the minds of the citizens throughout the country, wherein 41 persons died in a stampede and more than 100 were injured; it has wide ramifications in respect of the life of the citizens and in this context enforcing the fundamental rights of the families who lost their kith and kin is of utmost importance.Therefore, looking to the political undertone of the case and the fact that without having regard to the gravity of the incident, the comments which have been made before the media by the top officers of the police department may create doubt in the minds of the citizenry on impartiality and fair investigation.The faith and trust of the general public on the process of investigation must be restored in the criminal justice system, and one way to instill such trust is by ensuring that the investigation in the present case is completely impartial, independent and unbiased,"" the bench said.""Looking to the fact that the issue involved certainly has a bearing on the fundamental rights of the citizens and the incident which has shaken the national conscience deserves fair and impartial investigation. As such, by way of interim measure, direction deserves to be issued to hand over the investigation to the CBI, which would lead to fair administration of justice. There cannot be any doubt that fair investigation is the right of a citizen,"" it said.Immediately after the court passed the order, the state govt brought to its notice the fact that families of two victims, whose name was used to petition for CBI probe, had denied any role in filing the petitions. Senior advocates A M Singhvi and P Wilson, appearing for the state, said that fraud was being played on the court. Taking note of their submission, the bench said it would take cognizance of the issue but added that the controversy would not have a bearing on its order as other petitioners too had sought a CBI probe. One of the petitioners is the TVK party. Though it did not seek a CBI probe, the party had requested the court to direct that the ongoing probe be supervised by a retired SC judge.The bench also sought an explanation from the Madras high court on the manner in which a single-judge bench of the court had taken suo motu cognizance of the case and ordered SIT probe when a similar matter was pending before the Madurai bench of HC.""..it is clear that the division bench at Madurai denied the CBI investigation, holding that the investigation by the local police is not flawed, while the learned single judge at the Main Seat (Chennai), dissatisfied with the police investigation, directed for constitution of SIT. Such recourse prima facie indicates the lack of sensitivity and propriety to deal with such a matter, creating multiplicity of proceedings, for reasons best known to the Hon'ble Judges,"" the bench said.""But by taking suo motu cognizance even during pendency of writ petitions before the Madurai bench within whose jurisdiction the incident took place and also ignoring that the Hon'ble Chief Minister of the State has already constituted an Enquiry Commission comprising a retired Judge of the High Court, how far the order of the learned Single Judge was correct in taking suo motu cognizance and creating a SIT, is an issue. ""The court directed the CBI to forthwith appoint a senior officer for taking over the investigation and ordered the state police to immediately hand over the FIR and other relevant papers, evidence - digital or otherwise - collected till now to the CBI for further investigation.","Justices j k maheshwari and n v anjaria noted that top state police officials had made a statement that their subordinates were not at fault.
