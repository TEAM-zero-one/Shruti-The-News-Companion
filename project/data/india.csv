Where do they play SPB’s songs?

A few nights ago, sleep eluded me. I tossed, turned, and finally surrendered to wakefulness. I reached for my phone, seeking solace in music. As always, my playlist led me back to the 1990s, and SPB.As the first notes played, I sat up in sudden realization. The date had just turned to June 4. SPB’s birthday.S P Balasubrahmanyam. A voice that painted decades of Indian cinema with its warmth. A legend who gifted us more than 40,000 songs—, and my eternal favorite,. Though he has passed, his voice lingers—breathing through our memories.I cannot speak for what men feel when he sings, but I know what women hear—the tenderness we long for, the gentleness of love, the strength of restraint, the shimmer of longing. It has weight, and wings. It lifts us when we’re low and stills us when we tremble.But that night, I realized it was not just the magic of his voice that bound us to him. It was something deeper—his humility .I recalled a stage performance. SPB was singing live, captivating the audience. During the second background interlude, a short but vital flute solo was to emerge. It didn’t. Arunmozhi, the flutist, missed his moment.SPB, the professional, continued unflinchingly and ended the song to thunderous applause. But he didn’t exit. He turned to the audience and spoke—gently, generously—about the skill of the flutist and the difficulty of his art. He asked the audience permission to replay the interlude. This time, Arunmozhi played it perfectly, and the applause was louder.SPB saw the crestfallen face of a fellow musician and chose compassion. And then there was another moment—captured in a video that went viral after his passing. On his way to Sabarimala, unable to make the climb, SPB sat on a—a palanquin carried by porters. Before sitting, he touched the feet of the men who would carry him. It was not a ritual—it was reverence. A silent apology. A humble bow to those who bore his weight. A quiet assertion:In that instant, a couplet fromstirred within me:Traditionally, this couplet has been interpreted through the lens of karma: that one’s position in life—rider or bearer—is a consequence of past virtue or vice. But a few commentators differed and viewed through a different lens.What if Thiruvalluvar wasn’t affirming karma, but questioning our habit of justifying inequality through it? What if he was asking us not to preach to the rider, drunk on privilege—or to the bearer, bowed by burden? Perhaps he was reminding us that the journey matters more than the height. That the destination awaits us all—riders and bearers alike.SPB seemed to have lived that message. Never pompous, always gracious. He knew that fame is not a summit, but a platform held up by others. He respected every hand that steadied him—no matter how invisible.He was not just the voice of a generation. He was its conscience.If someone were to offer me a choice between heaven and hell, I would ask just one question:","The classic tamil text ‘thirukkural’ consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

WACE of Australia is 1st foreign government-backed board in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wace-of-australia-is-1st-foreign-government-backed-board-in-india/articleshow/121684705.cms,"NEW DELHI: After becoming the first country to establish foreign university campuses in India with the entry of University of Wollongong and Deakin University, Australia is now extending its footprint into school education, as Western Australia's WACE has become the first foreign govt-backed school board to begin operations in India, receiving equivalence from the Association of Indian Universities for its Class X and Class XII qualifications. This is the first such approval for a foreign board in India in 25 years.WACE, or Western Australian Certificate of Education, is the school-leaving qualification for students in Western Australia, administered by state's School Curriculum and Standards Authority (SCSA). WAIS, or the Western Australian International School System, is the framework through which this curriculum is delivered in international partner schools.Ange Smith, principal consultant for international education at SCSA, said the board has been running its international education programme since 1987 and began expanding its global presence more actively in 2019. ""Since then, we've worked with govt bodies in several countries to secure foreign board equivalence. India has been one of the most rigorous but rewarding. After AIU approval, we focused on identifying partner schools in India,"" she said.The board is currently operational in 16 countries.She said the National Education Policy 2020 played a significant role in shaping their entry strategy. ""We undertook curriculum mapping and found alignment with NEP priorities, especially around holistic development, skill integration and nurturing students beyond academics.""Explaining the curriculum structure, Smith said WAIS students take five subjects each in classes XI and XII, with an option to take six. English is compulsory, but only the top four ATAR (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank) courses count towards the final university entrance score. ""ATAR is based 50% on final exams and 50% on school-assessed coursework. This reduces pressure and supports consistent performance over two years,"" she said.In response to a request from Indian partner schools, Smith confirmed that work is underway to introduce a 10th board exam for WAIS students in India. ""Some Indian states may require a 10th board certificate for transitions, so we are developing one specifically for this context,"" she said.Syed Sultan Ahmed, chairperson of the Association of International Schools of India, said WAIS offers a balance between accessibility and international standards. ""It sits between CBSE and Cambridge. A CBSE school charging Rs 1 - 1.2 lakh annually can adopt WAIS with a 15-20% fee increase. It opens up global pathways without requiring Rs 45 lakh fees like IB,"" he said. The first WAIS partner schools in India have been established in Bengaluru and Bidar, both in Karnataka.Ahmed said the ATAR rank helps WAIS students apply to universities globally without separate entrance exams such as the SAT or JEE. ""The ATAR consolidates certification and university eligibility. It's one system for both. Students also become eligible for a Premier's Bursary of AUD 20,000 if they choose to study in Western Australia,"" he added.The curriculum incorporates seven general capabilities: literacy, numeracy, ICT, ethical understanding, civic and social responsibility, critical & creative thinking, and intercultural understanding.",Western australia's wace has become the first foreign govt-backed school board to begin operations in india.

This also applies to “waqf by user” properties that existed prior to the Waqf Amendment Act 2025 coming into force on April 8.Sharing that there were over 9 lakh waqf properties in India, minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju asserted that states should follow the timelines strictly and the boards must ensure that details of all waqf properties registered with them are uploaded on the portal within the stipulated 6 months.“All old properties that are in keeping with the law — titled and legitimate — will get included. Those that are illegal and without any documents will not get included. New waqf properties that get created going forward will be included in the database,” Rijiju said.According to officials, waqf properties that are not registered will need to approach their waqf boards to complete the process of registration. In the case of properties whose details are uploaded but which fail to get validated on the portal, there will be the option to approach the waqf tribunal for redressal.On what happens to properties which have supposedly been used as waqf but lack documents to prove so, Rijiju said: “Such waqf properties that do not have adequate documents but which are recognised socially and by govt and are working, we are not declaring them illegal. The issues are only with those kinds of properties which have been acquired forcefully, fraudulently, or do not have proper supportive documents or provisions. Moreover, the law does not prevent anyone from performing any religious rituals....”He, however, emphasised that going forward all waqf properties will need to fix whatever is missing in their documentation in order to come on board.On the portal, the entry of property details by the Mutawalli (caretaker) will be followed by validation by waqf boards and approval by designated govt authorities, after verification of records, to enable its entry into the ‘UMEED’ (Unified Waqf Management, Empowerment, Efficiency and Development Act 1995) portal.For the wide-ranging details related to any property, the portal also requires the Muttawali to give a declaration before uploading them. This includes questions like “have you failed to maintain regular accounts for two consecutive years or submit for two consecutive years the yearly statement of accounts as per law; have you been convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment of less than two years; and are you part of any unlawful organisation under UAPA”.Key features of the portal include creation of a digital inventory with geo-tagging of all waqf properties, online grievance redressal system, transparent leasing and usage tracking, integration with GIS mapping and public access to verified records and reports.Pointing out that there was no stay on the law by the judiciary, Rijiju stressed that the portal in no way violates the law or the Constitution.

NEW DELHI: A city court on Friday remanded four individuals, including Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) Head of Marketing and Revenue Nikhil Sosale, to 14-day judicial custody in connection with the tragic stampede outside M Chinnaswamy Stadium that claimed 11 lives.The additional chief metropolitan magistrate ordered Sosale, along with DNA Entertainment Private Limited executives Sunil Mathew, Sumanth, and Kiran Kumar, to be held in custody following their arrest earlier in the day in a joint operation by the Bengaluru police and the city’s crime branch.Sosale, arrested at Bengaluru Airport as he was about to board a flight to Dubai, has approached the Karnataka High Court challenging the legality of his detention.According to news agency, Justice S R Krishna Kumar heard the plea but declined to grant interim relief, adjourning the matter to June 9.As reported by news agency, Sosale has claimed in his petition that the arrest was ""arbitrary, illegal, and without any material basis,"" alleging that it occurred even before any preliminary investigation had been conducted.The police had registered an FIR against RCB, event organiser DNA Entertainment, and the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) on Thursday, invoking serious charges including culpable homicide and illegal assembly after chaos broke out during RCB’s IPL victory celebration.The free-entry event drew nearly 3 lakh people, leading to a deadly crush at the gates.In response to the FIR, senior KSCA officials, including president Raghuram Bhat and secretary A Shankar, moved the High Court seeking quashing of charges. The court granted interim protection from arrest to KSCA office bearers, directing them to fully cooperate with the investigation until the next hearing on June 16.Meanwhile, the state government suspended multiple senior police officials, including Bengaluru Police commissioner B Dayananda, following the incident. Others suspended include additional commissioner Vikash Kumar Vikash and DCP (Central) Shekhar HT.Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah defended the government's action amid BJP criticism, stating, “We have taken action against those who were visibly responsible and negligent in their duty,” and accused the opposition of politicising the tragedy.Deputy CM DK Shivakumar added, “The government has done its best to give justice... The case has been handed over to CID, and a judicial inquiry is underway”.On the political front, BJP state president BY Vijayendra claimed, “The government acted only under pressure,” referencing the sudden suspensions and arrests made post the public outcry.The Karnataka High Court has also taken suo motu cognisance of the incident and asked the state to file a status report by June 10.A one-man inquiry panel led by retired judge Justice John Michael D’Cunha has been appointed to probe the incident.","Royal challengers bengaluru (rcb) head of marketing and revenue nikhil sosale remanded to 14-day judicial custody in connection with the tragic stampede that claimed 11 lives.

Amit Shah launches language hub to 'decolonise' admin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amit-shah-launches-language-hub-to-decolonise-admin/articleshow/121684486.cms,"NEW DELHI: Continuing with his govt's 'decolonisation' project, Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday launched an Indian languages section within the department of official language as a step towards dispensing with the role of English in official communication.""It would prove to be a milestone in the path to freeing administration from the influence of foreign languages,"" Shah said as he announced the formation of Bharatiya Bhasha Anubhag.So far, English had been relied upon for easy and faster official communication and filework between the Centre and non-Hindi speaking states and also among the latter. ""We will definitely win the battle against imposition of English upon us,"" Shah, who over his six-year tenure in MHA has ensured that all filework and official communication in MHA is carried out in Hindi, declared at the launch of the Indian languages section on Friday.Elaborating on the purpose of Bharatiya Bhasha Anubhag at a press conference last year, secretary in department of official language Anshuli Arya had stated: ""Just like Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speeches in (non-Hindi speaking) states get instantly translated and can be heard by the public in their respective regional language, the Bharatiya Bhasha Anubhag, in collaboration with Centre for Deployment of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), will put in place a universal translation system for official communication.""For instance, if the chief minister of Tamil Nadu writes a letter to the Centre in Tamil, the Union minister here can read it in his language and have the reply sent in Tamil. This will help bring the regional languages on to the centre-stage,"" Arya said.In his address on Friday, Shah said the Indian languages section had made the department of official language ""complete"" by providing a strong and organised platform to all languages, incorporating the linguistic diversity of India.Shah underlined that the Indian people's potential can be fully exploited only when their process of thinking, analysis and decision-making are in their mother-tongue. ""Every language of ours is completely connected with other languages and development of all languages is not possible without each other...they assimilate like rivers into the Ganga of Indian culture,"" the Union home minister stated.","Union home minister amit shah launches an indian languages section within the department of official language.

The men were held on charges of cheating and forgery, after police recovered 21 debit cards, 30 cheque books, and six PAN cards issued under different names. Their arrest followed a routine vehicle check in Surat’s Udhna area, where an associate was caught carrying fake PAN cards and firm stamps.“We found the trio had opened 165 bank accounts using documents of people who had applied for personal loans. They gave access to the criminals for cyber crimes including digital arrest, hawala transfer, task fraud, betting, stock market fraud, online cheating and OTP fraud,” Desai said.According to Desai, the accused got in touch with cyber gangs based in Cuba, Thailand, and Malaysia through the messaging app Telegram. In exchange for access to the accounts, they were offered handsome commissions.“We have so far received details of 89 of these 165 accounts from the bank.All identified accounts have since been frozen after victims lodged complaints,” Desai said.The police believe the fraudsters used a clever trick to get the bank accounts opened, approaching people applying for personal loans and taking their documents, claiming they could help secure the funds.After opening an account using those documents, they would return the papers to the applicant, saying the loan was rejected.“Since they used to give their own mobile number to get an OTP, the applicant never realised that a bank account had been opened in their name,” Desai explained.""Initially, the gang would lease out each account for a one-time fee of Rs 7 lakh to Rs 17 lakh. As their operations grew, they began charging a 3% to 4% cut of every transaction routed through the accounts. In just six months, the three accused earned Rs 10 crore from commission as the transactions in each of these accounts used to continue all day.
