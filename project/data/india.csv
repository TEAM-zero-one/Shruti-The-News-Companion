"No leniency in dowry deaths, says SC, quashes bail order",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-leniency-in-dowry-deaths-says-sc-quashes-bail-order/articleshow/125649521.cms,"Noida Dowry Killing: Accused Says ‘I Have No Remorse’ After Being Shot In Police Encounter

NEW DELHI: Terming dowry as the worst social evil, Supreme Court said on Friday that courts should not show any leniency in granting bail in dowry death cases as it would not only erode public confidence in the justice delivery system but also embolden the perpetrators.It quashed the Allahabad high court order granting bail to a man accused of killing his wife within four months of their marriage after his demand for a Fortuner car was not fulfilled.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan held that HC wrongly applied the principle of 'bail is rule and jail is the exception' without considering the severity of the offence allegedly committed by the man.""This court is constrained to observe that judicial passivity or misplaced leniency in the face of such atrocities would only embolden perpetrators and undermine public confidence in the administration of justice. A firm and deterrent judicial response is, therefore, imperative - not only to uphold the majesty of law and do justice in the present case, but also to send an unequivocal message that neither law nor society will countenance barbarities born out of the evil of dowry,"" the bench said.It said permitting alleged prime perpetrators of such heinous crimes to remain at liberty on bail, when evidence indicates active infliction of physical as well as mental cruelty, may not only jeopardise fairness of the trial but also erode public faith in the administration of criminal justice.The bench said it cannot lose sight of the fact that marriage, in its true essence, is a sacred and noble institution founded on mutual trust, companionship and respect, but this pious bond has regrettably been reduced to a mere commercial transaction. ""The evil of dowry, though often sought to be camouflaged as gifts or voluntary offerings, has in reality become a means to display social status and to satiate material greed,"" it said.""The social evil of dowry not only corrodes the sanctity of marriage, but also perpetuates systemic oppression and subjugation of women. When such demands transgress the bounds of reason and culminate in cruelty - or worse, in the untimely death of a young bride - the offence transcends the private sphere of the family and assumes the character of a grave social crime. It ceases to remain a mere personal tragedy and becomes an affront to the collective conscience of society,"" it said.""The phenomenon of dowry deaths represents one of the most abhorrent manifestations of this social malaise, where the life of a young woman is extinguished within her matrimonial home - not for any fault of her own, but solely to satisfy the insatiable greed of others. Such heinous offences strike at the very root of human dignity and violate the constitutional guarantees of equality and life with dignity under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. They corrode the moral fibre of the community, normalise violence against women, and erode the foundations of a civilised society,"" it said.",Supreme court quashes allahabad high court order granting bail to a man accused of killing his wife within four months of their marriage.

'All 140 MLAs Are Mine': DK Shivakumar Amid Karnataka CM Speculation; Siddaramaiah Responds

BENGALURU: With the leadership tussle in Karnataka seeing dramatic twists and turns by the hour, chief minister Siddaramaiah - following a nudge from the Congress high command - on Friday invited his deputy, DK Shivakumar , to a breakfast meeting on Saturday.Siddaramaiah said the high command had spoken to both netas and directed them to meet.""I've invited Shivakumar for breakfast at 9am. If he comes, I'll discuss (the issue) with him,"" he said, adding he would obey the high command.A senior party functionary in Delhi said both politicians had been asked to resolve the issue through discussions. ""If they don't, then the high command will intervene,"" he said.Another state functionary said the party wanted the two to present ""a mutually agreed solution"" to the high command, which it would endorse if both were on board.A day after posting a cryptic message on social media, Shivakumar Friday fired a new salvo - that of sacrifice, after promise - by invoking Sonia Gandhi's decision to forgo the prime ministership while recommending Manhoman Singh's name in 2004.Even as he lauded Sonia's leadership, Shivakumar took the opportunity to reach out to voters, urging them to continue backing the Siddaramaiah-led Congress govt. He appealed for public support in the 2028 assembly elections, describing stability as crucial for the party's long-term plans.While the remarks were framed as praise for Sonia, they triggered a debate within political circles over the message Shivakumar intended to convey. The comments sparked speculation whether he was subtly signalling that Siddaramaiah should make way (sacrifice) for him, or whether he was projecting himself as someone willing to ""sacrifice"" his chief ministerial claim.Former CM and Union minister M Veerappa Moily criticised the power tussle, calling the situation ""practically an anarchy"". In an interaction with a news agency, Moily said the open confrontation had caused ""national embarrassment"" and blamed Congress high command for ""allowing the situation to worsen"". He warned that the party, already weak in many states, could struggle to stay in govt in the state if the ""manufactured crisis"" was not addressed.Meanwhile, a day after Adichunchanagiri Mutt's Nirmalananda Swami visited Shivakumar, another prominent Vokkaliga seer, Brahmeshwara Mutt pontiff Gurugunda Nanjavadutha Swami, called on him and publicly backed him for the CM's post.","Siddaramaiah says he will obey the high command.

'All 140 MLAs Are Mine': DK Shivakumar Amid Karnataka CM Speculation; Siddaramaiah Responds

Below are the key developments:

Mahaswamiji backs Shivakumar, urges CM issue resolution

BJP's BY Vijayendra on tussle for CM post in state

Shettar warns Karnataka’s finances are critical

Priyank Kharge meets DKS

Vokkaliga groups rally behind DKS

Balakrishna backs DKS

Yathindra Siddaramaiah backs his father

Kharge says decision will follow consultations

Leadership decision likely only in January

Congress high command’s decision on Karnataka leadership change is likely only after January.

The delay can be linked to CM Siddaramaiah’s personal goal of staying in office until 6 January 2026.

Remaining in office till that date would allow Siddaramaiah to match D Devaraj Urs’ record as Karnataka’s longest-serving CM.

Siddaramaiah sees completing a full five-year term as part of his political legacy and believes this is his last term.

Analysts say Siddaramaiah’s Ahinda base and political journey mirror that of Urs, who championed backward-class empowerment.

Both leaders draw strength from the same Ahinda social coalition and have a history of rivalry despite jointly winning the 2023 election.

BENGALURU: The tussle for Karnataka’s chief ministerial post has intensified, with camps supporting chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar (DKS) stepping up pressure. Both leaders insist the final decision rests with the Congress high command, even as political signalling intensifies on the ground.Amid political drama both leaders were seen together on stage in an event on Friday.A day earlier, Siddaramaiah asserted that he would complete his full five-year term as CM, while Shivakumar publicly dismissed all speculation of a leadership change, saying he is “not in a hurry” and has had no discussions with senior Congress leaders on the CM post.During his visit to Mumbai, DKS clarified that he met no national leaders.“I came only for a family function. There was no meeting. If a meeting has to happen, it will be in Bengaluru or Delhi,” he said.Speculation around a mid-term power shift continues to be fueled by the 2023 'power-sharing arrangement', frequently referenced in political circles.Spiritual leader Dr Nanjavadhutha Mahaswamiji, pontiff of the Sri Guru Gundla Brahmeshwara Mahasamsthana, said, ""We had expected Siddaramaiah to become the CM in the first term. Considering his age, we thought he would be given the opportunity. The high command had promised to make him CM for at least 2.5 years. All sections of society are supporting Shivakumar. Let's first resolve the issue there and give Shivakumar an opportunity""Karnataka BJP President BY Vijayendra took a dig at Congress, saying it would not be surprising if Karnataka Congress splits into two factions.While Vijayendra stated that the BJP has nothing to do with the ""internal bickering"" within the ruling Congress, he added, the state administration is being affected.Former CM and BJP leader Jagdish Shettar says Karnataka's financial situation is already critical and the ongoing power tussle over the CM post is going to affect it adversely.AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge’s son, Priyank Kharge, met Shivakumar at his Bengaluru residence on Friday morning, adding curiosity to the already charged atmosphere. Priyank maintained that the high command will intervene only when necessary, and urged an end to needless speculation.“Congress was, is, and will remain united. We walk the talk,” he said.Several Vokkaliga community organisations have come out openly in support of Shivakumar, with plans to write to the Congress leadership urging that he be made the CM.MLA HC Balakrishna threw his weight behind DKS, stating that the high command must step in and take a decision soon. He expressed hope that Shivakumar would eventually take oath as Chief Minister.Congress MLC and Siddaramaiah’s son, Yathindra, reiterated his support for the current CM, saying he is unaware of any power-sharing pact between his father and DKS.Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge clarified that a leadership decision will be made after consultations involving central leaders, Siddaramaiah, and Shivakumar. He underscored the need for deliberation before any move is made.","Siddaramaiah vs shivakumar: power-sharing tussle rages in karnataka congress.

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing leadership crisis in Karnataka over the chief ministerial post, veteran Congress leader M Veerappa Moily on Friday launched a broadside against the party high command, saying that “discipline” has to be brought into the party.Talking to news agency IANS, the former Union minister said that the high command representatives should have foreseen some of these developments in the state.“If you want to turn it into a political turmoil, yes, it can happen, but the leaders of the Congress party who are in responsible positions, and also our high command representatives, whoever they may be, should have foreseen some of these developments.

NEW DELHI: The Congress would have a strong feeling of deja vu about the turn of events in Karnataka. The grand-old-party stares at a political crisis in the state that threatens the very stability of its government. Ironically, while the crisis is in Karnataka, on test is the Congress high command - which has proved to be a bad crisis manager in recent times.The open power tussle between chief minister Siddaramaiah and deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar has reached a point of no return, forcing the top leadership into a huddle. Ironically, the seeds of the current crisis were sown two-and-a-half years back - when both the regional stalwarts had staked claim to the CM post - following the party's emphatic victory over the BJP in the 2023 assembly elections. So the big question is: Has the top Congress leadership failed to act in time, yet again?We have seen similar leadership tussles play out in two states - Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan - where the factionalism between state Congress leaders played a key role in the party eventually losing power. The common thread in all three states has been the Congress leadership's reluctance to act decisively in the fight between the party's old guard and the younger leaders.In Madhya Pradesh, when Jyotiraditya Scindia wanted to step into the leadership role, Congress backed veteran heavyweights Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh . This eventually saw the Scindia Junior quitting the party and joining the BJP. Scindia's revolt brought down the Congress government and in the next assembly elections, Kamal Nath and Digivijay Singh failed miserably to counter the BJP.Today, the Congress in Madhya Pradesh is in doldrums while Scindia is a Union minister.In Rajasthan, when Sachin Pilot, who as state president had led the Congress to emphatic victory in 2018, sought the chief minister's chair, the party again backed state veteran Ashok Gehlot. Gehlot, who had led the party to defeat in 2013, became the chief minister again and Sachin Pilot and his supporters were left disappointed. When Sachin stepped up his campaign for the top job, Gehlot used his full might to crush the rebellion. Pilot, who camped at a resort with his supporters, was eventually convinced by the Gandhi family to stay with the party. While the party high command bet big on Gehlot, he could not win the state in 2024.Now, we see a similar script play out in Karnataka. Siddramaiah, who was made the chief minister in 2013, led the party to defeat in 2018. DK Shivakumar, as the state Congress president, played a key role in the party's victory in 2023. But once again, senior leader Siddaramaiah staked claim to the top post and the party eventually went with him. DKS then remained defiant for almost a week before eventually relenting. DKS now claims that there was a secret deal in the know of five-six people about rotating the post of chief minister and wants the Congress high command to ensure that he gets his due. But the Congress high command, as usual, allowed the crisis to blow out of hand. And now, when the factionalism is out in the open, it is trying to broker a truce.The last-minute crisis management may save the Congress government in Karnataka for now, but the open power tussle has the potential to damage the party's image and perhaps also its electoral prospects. The Congress had managed a historic victory against the BJP in 2023. Instead of consolidating its gains, the party finds itself managing the power play between its state leadership. But then, this is how the Congress high command has worked in recent years. The Congress high command needed to anticipate this crisis in Karnataka and should have worked to find a balance between Siddaramaiah, who is past his prime, and DKS - who is the strongest contender to lead the party forward. Perhaps the Congress leadership needs to be reminded about an old adage: A stitch in time saves nine.It will be interesting to see how the Congress high command wriggles out of this crisis and how much this impacts the party's prospects in the 2028 assembly elections. Is the grand old party on the verge of losing yet another state?",The open power tussle between chief minister siddaramaiah and deputy chief minister d k shivakumar has reached a point of no return. We have seen similar leadership tussles play out in two states - madhya pradesh and rajasthan.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125641385,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-970835,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

The Planning Department has issued instructions to all departments. No birth certificate is attached to the Aadhaar card; therefore, it cannot be considered a birth certificate. Amit Singh Bansal, Special Secretary of the Planning Department, issued the order to all departments. The Aadhaar card is no longer valid as a birth certificate,"" the notification read.The Maharashtra government also issued a similar order that says Aadhaar card will not be considered as a document for making a delayed birth certificate and that all birth certificates made only through the Aadhaar card after the Births and Deaths Registration (Amendment) Act, 2023, will be cancelled, a notice by the State Revenue Department said.Instructions have been given to take action against the officers who have issued these certificates till now.The 16-point verification guideline by the Revenue Department said that the orders issued by the Deputy Tehsildar after the amendment made in the Birth and Death Registration Act, 1969, on August 11, 2023, should be withdrawn, and the withdrawn order should be verified at the level of the competent authority or the District Collector.The move comes even as the Supreme Court has allowed Aadhaar to be used in a different context, like as a proof of identity during inclusion in the Bihar electoral roll. Accepting a demand of the opposition, the court directed the Election Commission to accept Aadhaar along with the 11 other documents already permitted under the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) process.Last week, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed all district magistrates to take swift and stringent action against illegal immigrants.Reiterating that law and order, national security, and social harmony remain his administration’s top priorities, he said no form of illegal activity would be tolerated.“The chief minister has directed that each district administration ensure the identification of illegal immigrants living in their area and initiate action as per the rules,” the statement read,, according to news agency PTI.“The chief minister has also directed that temporary detention centres be established in each district to house infiltrators,” it added.As per the statement, illegal immigrants holding foreign citizenship will be kept in these centres until the required verification process is completed.Adityanath said those held in the detention facilities will be deported to their countries of origin following established procedures.Uttar Pradesh shares an open border with Nepal, allowing unrestricted movement for citizens of both countries, while individuals of other nationalities are subject to checks.This comes at a time when a nationwide SIR is being carried out in 12 states and union territories, including Uttar Pradesh, with the final elector's list to be published on February 7, 2026.",Aadhar cards will no longer be accepted as the only birth certificate or proof of date of birth in uttar pradesh and maharashtra.

But I would like to say that we will resolve such issues,” Kharge had said.“People in the high command — Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and I — will sit together and deliberate on this… We will give the medicine when required,” he added.This was the first acknowledgment by Kharge that there is indeed a power struggle between Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar in Karnataka.Meanwhile, Karnataka minister Priyank Kharge also said that the Congress high command possesses the sense of timing to resolve the intensifying “power tussle” between chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar.Speaking to reporters, the minister said Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar have agreed to travel to Delhi for a meeting when summoned by the party high command.“Nobody has given any official invitation or statement on the meeting in New Delhi. The CM and the deputy CM have said that they will go to Delhi if they are invited by the Congress president or AICC general secretary and Karnataka in charge Randeep Singh Surjewala. Let the invitation come from Delhi, then only it will be decided,” Kharge, who is Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge’s son, said.Asked about the increasing confusion, Kharge said, “The high command has the sense of timing. It will take a call, keeping in mind the right time.” He urged people not to speculate further and said the high command will intervene whenever necessary.As the Congress government in Karnataka completed the halfway mark of its five-year tenure on November 20, the power tussle within the party has intensified over a possible change of guard in the state, with a section claiming an alleged “power-sharing” agreement between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar in 2023.",'all 140 mlas are mine': dk shivakumar amid karnataka cm speculation.

What BJP said





NEW DELHI: Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party engaged in war of words after the grand old party's former MP claimed meddling by US and Israel intelligence agencies in the 2014 Parliamentary elections. Kumar Ketkar blamed Mossad and CIA for the Congress party's loss.BJP MP Sambit Patra, in turn, quipped saying that the Congress lost because ""Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI"" carried forward its ""agenda in India"".The former Rajya Sabha MP noted that the party secured 145 Lok Sabha seats in 2004 and increased its tally to 206 in the 2009 general election. If that trajectory had continued, he argued, the Congress might have reached around 250 seats and easily held on to power. Instead, the party’s seat count plunged to 44 in 2014, he observed.""There were organisations that acted in a way that 'till the time we do not bring down the Congress from 206, we would not be able to play games here (in India),"" he said.""One of the organisations was the CIA and another was the Mossad of Israel. Both had decided that they had to do something in India. If a stable Congress government or a Congress-led alliance government came back to power again, they would not have been able to interfere in India and implement their policies,"" he added.""The Mossad prepared detailed data on states and constituencies. The CIA and the Mossad have detailed data on states and constituencies,"" the former journalist said.The BJP countered Congress leader Ketkar’s allegation, insisting that its victories come from the support of ""the people, not foreign intelligence agencies"".""Neither the CIA nor the Mossad makes the BJP win. It is the people who make the BJP win. Those who get gas cylinders and housing, as well as the poor, farmers, women and youth, make the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) win,"" he said.""If you will work on the ISI’s blueprint, seek to reconstruct the Babri mosque, oppose Ram temple… If the Congress follows the ISI agenda, how will it progress?"" the BJP leader told reporters at the party headquarters,"" he added.","Congress, bjp face off over kumar ketkar's controversial remark cia, mossad helped modi win in 2014.here's what former congress mp said and what bjp said about it.

Women in polygamous marriages: Study reveals what Muslim women experience when husbands bring in more wives

NEW DELHI: The Assam Assembly on Tuesday passed “The Assam Prohibition of Polygamy Bill, 2025,” aiming to ban polygamous marriages across the state and impose strict penalties on those who enter into or conceal a second marriage while the first is still valid.The law, introduced by Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on the first day of the winter session, will apply statewide except in Sixth Schedule areas and to members of Scheduled Tribes as defined under the Constitution.Speaking before the state assembly approved the bill, Sarma said the legislation, which bans polygamous marriages across most of Assam, is not against Islam. He said the legislation was “irrespective of religion and not against Islam as being perceived by a section”, reported PTI.""Islam can't promote polygamy. If this bill passes, then you will get a chance to be a true Muslim. This bill is not against Islam. The true Islamic people will welcome this Act. Countries like Turkey have also banned Polygamy; there is an arbitration council in Pakistan..."" Sarma said, as cited by ANI.Sarma has also pledged to implement the Uniform Civil Code in Assam if he is re-elected in next year’s assembly polls.""If I return to the assembly as the Chief Minister, I will bring the UCC in the first session of the assembly. I give you my commitment that I will bring the UCC to Assam,"" Sarma added.The bill was introduced amid the absence of opposition MLAs from Congress, CPI(M), and Raijor Dal, who staged a walkout following a discussion on the death of singer Zubeen Garg.The bill defines polygamy as marrying another person while either party already has a valid, existing marriage or a living spouse from whom they are not legally divorced or whose marriage has not been annulled.It states that anyone entering into a polygamous marriage will face up to seven years in prison and a fine, as specified in law.""No person shall marry, if, he has a living spouse or he is not legally separated from the other spouse following due procedure of law, after marriage, or he is a party to a marriage which is not yet dissolved or annulled by a decree of divorce and either has right to appeal or the specified time for appeal has not been expired or is in appeal, or the appeal has been presented but has not yet been dismissed,"" the bill mentions, as cited by ANI.""Whoever abets any offences punishable under this Act or attempts to commit any such offence shall be punishable with the punishment as provided under the Act for the offence of polygamy. Whoever, during the lifetime of his or her spouse or during subsistence of a valid marriage or without having been lawfully divorced from the spouse, or without having been declared the marriage null and void or dissolved, contracts a marriage contravening any of the provisions contained in the Act under Section 4 shall be guilty of an offence punishable with imprisonment upto 7 years and a fine,"" the bill adds.","Assam assembly passes 'prohibition of polygamy bill, 2025' chief minister himanta biswa sarma says the legislation is not against islam.

ED Cracks Down On ‘White-Collar Terror Module’, Conducts 25 Raids Linked To Al-Falah University

What triggered the probe?

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday accused Al-Falah University chancellor Javed Ahmed Siddiqui of ""fraudulently acquiring land"" in Delhi’s Madanpur Khadar by forging documents in the names of deceased Hindu landowners.According to the agency, land in Khasra No. 792 was transferred to the Tarbia Education Foundation, a trust linked to Siddiqui, on the basis of a forged General Power of Attorney (GPA).A General Power of Attorney (GPA) is a legal document that authorises one person to act, sign and make decisions on behalf of another in broad matters, including property and financial transactions.The ED said several landowners whose names appear on the documents had died between 1972 and 1998, yet a GPA dated January 7, 2004, was created in their names and later used to reregister the land.The agency has termed the transfer fraudulent and said the fake documents were the foundation of the acquisition. Siddiqui is currently in ED custody as the probe continues.The ED on November 18 arrested Jawad Ahmed Siddiqui, the founder of Al Falah University, which came under scrutiny after the alleged involvement of three of its professors in a terror module behind the i20 car blast near Delhi's Red Fort on November 10.Siddiqui, Chairman of Al Falah group, was arrested under Section 19 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002.The arrest took place after a detailed investigation and analysis of evidence gathered during search action conducted at premises related to Al Falah group in the ongoing probe in an ECIR recorded by the ED under PMLA in connection with the Al Falah Group.The prime accused, Dr Umar Un Nabi, was a former student of the university located in Haryana's Faridabad.The arrest comes, hours after the ED launched raids against the Al-Falah University along with its office in Okhla and the university's promoters as initial probe had revealed discrepancies regarding UGC and NAAC recognition.The central agency conducted raids at 25 different places across the national capital, intensifying the Delhi car blast probe. Nine shell firms connected to the group, each registered at the same address, are now under scrutiny.ED initiated investigation against Al Falah group on the basis of 2 FIRs registered by the Crime Branch, Delhi Police, based on the allegations that Al-Falah University, Faridabad, has made fraudulent and misleading claims of NAAC accreditation with an intention to deceive students, parents, and stakeholders for wrongful gain.It has been further mentioned in FIR that Al-Falah University, Faridabad, has falsely claimed UGC recognition under Section 12(B) of the UGC Act, 1956 with oblique motive to cheat the aspirants, students, parents, guardians, stakeholders and general public to gain wrongfully and cause wrongful loss to them.The UGC clarified that Al-Falah University is included only under Section 2(f) as a State Private University, has never applied for inclusion under Section 12(B), and is not eligible for grants under that provision.","Javed ahmed siddiqui accused of ""fraudulently acquiring land"" in delhi's madanpur khadar.

Senior advocate Shashi Kiran and lawyer Sadhana Sandhu, appearing for the organisation told the court that various agencies including WHO, UN agencies and human-rights bodies have repeatedly called for states to prevent, criminalise and eliminate FGM as medical evidence showed that short-term and long-term physical and psychological harms are caused due to it.""It is further submitted that there is not any independent law specifically banning this. The act itself falls under multiple offences relating to causing hurt under BNS, such as sections 113, 118(1), 118(2), and 118(3). Even in Pocso Act, touching the genitalia of a minor for non-medical reasons is a violation. It is submitted that WHO has classified FGM as a gross violation of human rights of girls and women. It violates the fundamental guarantees provided by Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Furthermore, FGM is a serious health concern as it can cause infections, problems relating to childbirth, and other severe physical impairments. In Dec 2012, UNGA adopted a unanimous resolution which called for elimination of FGM,"" the petition said.It said approximately 75% of women of the community put their daughters to the barbaric practice of FGM and pleaded the court to intervene to put to end the practice. The petitioner said several countires including US, UK, Australia, and several African countries have banned FGM but India does not have a specific law banning FGM.""Dawoodi Bohras are a religious denomination within Shia Islam. They are the most well-known Muslim community in India to practice FGC, known as Khatna in the community - a ritual that many Islamic scholars around the world do not endorse.

"Maharashtra corporation polls get SC nod, with a rider",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-corporation-polls-get-sc-nod-with-a-rider/articleshow/125647170.cms,"NEW DELHI: The SC has cleared decks for the Maharashtra State Election Commission (SEC) to go ahead with the election process for all municipal corporations, zila panchayats and panchayat samitis in the state, except where total reservation exceeded the 50% ceiling. The SEC informed the court that quota exceeds 50% in two of the 29 corporations.The SEC, through senior advocate Balbir Singh, informed a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that the quota exceeds 50% in two of the 29 municipal corporations, and that a similar exercise to compute the total reservation in 32 zila panchayats and 336 panchayat samitis will be carried out soon. The bench directed the SEC to initiate the election process for these three categories of local bodies, which include the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. The SEC said it would soon announce the election schedule for these local bodies.SEC also informed the court that of the 246 municipal councils and 42 nagar panchayats, where polling is scheduled for Dec 2, the total reservation exceeded the 50% ceiling in 57 of them - 40 in municipal councils and 17 in nagar panchayats. The bench said till it decided the petitions, reservation cannot exceed 50% in any of the civic bodies.Directing the SEC to hold the Dec 2 polls as scheduled, it said results of the 57 local bodies, where reservation exceeds 50%, would be subject to the outcome of pending petitions. It fixed the final hearing on these petitions on Jan 21.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the petitioners, repeatedly stressed that the total reservation, including OBC, cannot exceed the 50% ceiling fixed by constitution benches of SC. He said in local body territory where SC and ST population exceeded 50%, proportionate quota for them can exceed 50%, with no reservation for OBCs. Senior advocate Indira Jaising contested this stand, saying this would deprive backward classes of quota and result in absence of their representation in the civic bodies.The elections could not be conducted in the civic bodies because of a status quo order passed by SC in Aug 2022 on petitions challenging the state govt's ordinance, which based on the Banthia Commission recommendations had provided for 27% OBC reservation in local bodies.Giving 27% quota to OBCs in all civic bodies, the petitions said, would breach the 50% ceiling on reservation in certain areas where SC and ST constitute a majority, warranting assigning of quota over and above the standard 15% and 7.5% reservation for them respectively, and correspondingly the OBC quota would shrink to keep the total quota within the 50% limit.On May 6, SC had asked the SEC to complete by Sept 30 the elections for local bodies following the OBC reservation criteria as existed prior to the Banthia Commission's report in July 2022. On Sept 16, SC had extended the deadline to Jan 31after criticising the SEC for giving excuses to justify its lethargy in completing the exercise within the time limit.","The sc has cleared decks for the election process for all municipal corporations, zila panchayats andpanchayat samitis in the state.

They submitted that the Haryana incident was not a solitary one and many such cases have been reported across the country.""These incidents of women and girls being subjected to invasive and degrading checks in various institutional settings to check whether they are menstruating is in gross violation of their right to life, dignity, privacy and bodily integrity under Article 21 of the Constitution.

No Indian metro had ‘safe’ air in past 10 years: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-indian-metro-had-safe-air-in-past-10-yrs-study/articleshow/125643655.cms,"Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

MUMBAI: No major Indian city has ""good"" air quality. A 10-year assessment of air pollution across major urban centres has found that none of the country's top cities met safe Air Quality Index (AQI) levels at any point between 2015 and Nov 2025.The report, prepared by Climate Trends, an environmental research firm, analysed long-term pollution patterns across 11 major cities. Delhi remained India's most polluted city throughout the period of study, with average AQI levels peaking above 250 in 2016 and hovering around 180 this year.Despite marginal dips after 2019, the national capital never approached healthy air-quality thresholds. Vehicular emissions, industrial pollution and crop burning were major contributors, compounded by the region's geographical constraints.Cities such as Lucknow, Varanasi and Ahmedabad which recorded persistently high average AQI values — often above 200— in first half of the decade, showed some improvement in the second half. While southern and western cities such as Mumbai, Chennai, Pune and Bengaluru recorded relatively moderate AQI levels, even they did not meet safe thresholds. Bengaluru posted lowest AQI readings in the country — between 65 and 90 — still too high for ""good"" category.AQI is based on the concentration of toxic particulate matter, PM2.5 or PM10, in the air, whichever is higher.Geography plays a significant role in prolonging pollution episodes, especially across the northern plains. ""With cold north-westerly winds sweeping into the plains, minimum temperatures are set to drop further — making it even harder for pollutants to disperse,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president at Skymet Weather.He added that this year's weak western disturbances — extratropical storms that bring winter rain and snow to northwestern India — were inadequate and failed to trigger widespread rainfall.""Without rain to wash pollutants out of the atmosphere, the pollution lingers for longer periods, leading to early and persistent smog-like conditions,"" said Palawat.During the cold winters of the Indo-Gangetic plains, the phenomenon of ""temperature inversion"" — which limits vertical air movement — effectively traps pollution in the lower layers of the atmosphere. Dense city structures and tall buildings further slow wind speeds, exacerbating stagnation.Experts stressed the need for better planning and data-driven interventions. ""Technology can help address many local pollution sources within your own airshed, but this requires reliable data,"" said Prof S N Tripathi of IIT-Kanpur. Palak Balyan, research lead at Climate Trends said, ""What India needs is sustained, long-term, science-based policy reform backed by genuine political will to take tough decisions. ""","Delhi remained india's most polluted city throughout the period of study. Vehicular emissions, industrial pollution and crop burning were major contributors.
