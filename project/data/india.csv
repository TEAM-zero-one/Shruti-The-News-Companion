'Paneer and milk are not veg': Doctor’s remark triggers online storm over dietary classifications,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/paneer-and-milk-are-not-veg-doctors-remark-triggers-online-storm-over-dietary-classifications/articleshow/118006017.cms,"NEW DELHI: A debate erupted on social media after Dr Sylvia Karpagam, working editor of the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics , questioned the classification of milk and paneer as vegetarian foods.The discussion began when Dr Sunita Sayammagar shared a photo of a thali, describing it as a “vegetarian meal” rich in protein, good fats, and fiber. Responding to the post, Dr Karpagam challenged the notion that dairy products are vegetarian.“Also, paneer and milk are not 'veg.' They are animal source foods ... same like chicken, fish, beef, and all,” she wrote on X.The thali in question included a mix of vegetables such as cucumber, carrots, and onions, alongside paneer, coconut, and dal.Her comment sparked a divided response. Many X users argued that since milk and paneer are derived without killing the animal, they remain vegetarian. Others, however, claimed that labeling dairy as vegetarian was influenced by Western dietary classifications.“No one is killed… to eat paneer or milk,” one X user pointed out.Another user explained, “Milk products are animal products that no animal has to be killed to get, hence it is indeed vegetarian & not vegan. Any killing or harm to animals happens in the milking setup. ‘Veg’ means vegetarian.”In response, Dr Karpagam asked, “So why are eggs not 'veg'?”—a counterpoint that further fueled the debate.","The discussion began when dr sunita sayammagar shared a photo of a thali.

Exit poll track record: A look back



2013: Underestimating AAP's rise



2015: A landslide that no poll saw coming



2020: Polls more accurate, but still off the mark



NEW DELHI: With only two days between voting and results, debates over exit polls heated-up as two more surveys were released on Thursday, echoing earlier predictions. Aam Aadmi Party , however, dismissed all projections, arguing that pollsters have ""historically"" underestimated its performance.Most exit polls were released on Wednesday shortly after voting concluded in Delhi. They largely predicted a BJP comeback in the capital after 27 years, dealing a major setback to AAP, which has ruled for over a decade and remains a strong political force.AAP national spokesperson Reena Gupta cited past election trends, emphasising that exit polls had misjudged the party’s success in 2013, 2015, and 2020. ""Every time, AAP was predicted to win fewer seats than it actually did,"" she said. Senior leader Sanjay Singh went further, ridiculing the projections as ""surveys by massage and spa companies.""Kejriwal said in his post on X: ""These predictions are meant to shape political sentiment and weaken our party by causing defections.""Moreover, majority of pollsters have missed the mark in recent elections, including the 2024 Lok Sabha polls and state assembly elections in Haryana, Jharkhand, and Maharashtra.Exit polls in 2013 largely favoured the BJP, predicting an average of 35 seats—just short of a majority—while forecasting 17 each for AAP and Congress The actual results, however, saw AAP win 28 seats, BJP 32, and Congress just 8.The closest prediction came from Today’s Chanakya, which estimated AAP would win 31 seats. The party, propelled by the India Against Corruption movement, formed a short-lived government with Congress support before resigning over the Jan Lokpal Bill after 48-days of assuming power.Six exit polls in 2015 forecast an AAP victory but failed to grasp its scale. While the average prediction gave AAP 45 seats, the party stunned observers by winning 67.BJP scored just 3, and Congress was left with no legislators in the assembly.The highest estimate for AAP came from Axis My India at 53 seats, while India TV-CVoter predicted only 39. Most polls also overestimated BJP’s chances, with many projecting over 20 seats.By 2020, exit polls were more aligned with AAP’s dominance but still fell short of the final numbers. On average, they predicted 52 seats for AAP and 17 for BJP, while the actual results saw AAP win 62 and BJP secure 8. Congress, once again, failed to win a single seat.India Today-Axis My India provided the closest estimate, forecasting 59-68 seats for AAP. Meanwhile, Sudarshan News gave BJP its highest projected tally at 24-28 seats, though the party ultimately fell far below that mark.","Most exit polls were released on wednesday shortly after voting concluded in delhi.

MEA said, ""All those who value the freedom struggle that nurtured the 'Bangla' identity and pride are aware of the importance of this residence for the national consciousness of Bangladesh.""Bangladesh’s ministry of foreign affairs has urged India to take immediate and appropriate action, in the spirit of mutual respect and understanding, to prevent Hasina from making “false and incendiary” statements via social media and other communication channels while in India.Dhaka added that Hasina’s statements — she said, “They can demolish abuilding, but not the history... but they must also remember that history takes its revenge” — amounted to “hostile acts” against Bangladesh and accused her of “inciting instability” in the country.Foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain told reporters, “We will observe what steps India takes.”On Wednesday evening, protesters gathered in front of Mujib’s residence in Dhanmondi area of Dhaka, which had been turned into a memorial. Mujibur Rah man, his wife and three brothers were assassinated in the house in Aug 1975. The rally was prompted by a social media call for a “bulldozer procession” ahead of Hasina’s scheduled virtual address from exile in India.The mob set the memorial house on fire, and similar incidents of arson were reported across the country. The building in the adjacent plot, which had housed offices of several Awami League outfits, was also demolished. Protesters also vandalised murals of Mujibur Rahman, while the residence of Hasina’s late husband, Wajed Mian, also located in Dhanmondi, was set afire by the demonstrators.Meanwhile, Bangladesh Nationalist Party, in an unusual show of unity, condemned the demolition, asserting that these actions are aimed at “destroying democracy” and could lead to chaos, impeding the country’s future democratic progress.","Bangladesh summons acting indian high commissioner pawan badhe to lodge a formal protest over ousted pm sheikh hasina 's ""fabricated and provocative"" comments made on wednesday.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","Union budget 2023: a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour. The income-tax act, 1961 (act) provides numerous deductions for individuals.

When will your loan EMIs come down?

Loan EMI calculator after RBI MPC meet: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Sanjay Malhotra on Friday announced the Monetary Policy Committee’s unanimous decision to cut the key repo rate by 25 basis points. Repo rate is the rate at which banks are able to borrow money from the RBI.A repo rate cut is always good news for home loan borrowers, since EMIs come down. But this time around, it’s a double bonanza for the middle class! With FM Nirmala Sitharaman having announced NIL income tax up to Rs 12 lakh income levels in Budget 2025, the relief in loan EMIs is the cherry on the cake.Experts say that come April 1, 2025, middle class and common man will enjoy the twin benefits of changes in income tax slabs and rates and lower EMIs.So how much will you save on EMIs? What does the income tax relief + lower EMIs combination mean for middle class monthly savings? And, importantly, when will your loan EMIs start coming down? We take a look:According to loan EMI calculations provided by BASIC Home Loan, an individual with a home loan amount of Rs 50 lakh and paying a current interest rate of 8.75% for a 30 year loan will see a reduction of around Rs 889/- per month in the EMI. The EMI amount will go down from Rs 39,335/- to Rs 38,446/-Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime The biggest takeaway for the middle class is the combined bonanza from income tax slab and rate changes under the new income tax regime and the prospect of lower EMIs in the coming months. In an analysis BankBazaar explains this better:“A salaried person with a gross income of Rs 25 lakh and a home loan of Rs 50 lakh (20 years, 9%, 12 EMIs paid by March), can hope to save a total of Rs 1.37 lakh in FY 2025-26. This will be through a combination of interest savings on the home loan rate reduction of 25 basis points and the tax savings from higher tax slabs from April 1,” says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.The analysis suggests that an individual under the new income tax regime with a gross salary of Rs 25 lakh will now possibly save up to Rs 11,461/- per month with the changes in income tax slabs, rates and the reduced interest rate on loan. This benefit could go up to Rs 13.389/- per month for an individual earning a gross salary of Rs 50 lakh.According to Vivek Iyer, Partner and Financial Services Risk Leader at Grant Thornton Bharat, the repo rate cut transmission will take about 3 to 4 months. “It may not be transmitted in full as banks would need to transmit it only to borrowers whose credit standing is good and hence on an overall portfolio basis it may vary from bank to bank,” Iyer told TOI.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime Atul Monga, Co-Founder and CEO, BASIC Home Loan also says that it will take some time for the repo rate cut relief to trickle down to loan borrowers.“The MPC’s decision to reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% is a strategic move to fuel economic growth by making borrowing more affordable. Both existing and new borrowers under floating rate loans stand to benefit from lower interest rates, improving loan affordability and accessibility. Fixed rate loan borrowers will remain unaffected from the rate cut,” Monga told TOI.“That said, banks and housing finance companies may take some time to fully transmit the benefits of this rate cut to borrowers, depending on their policies and rate cycle. Lenders have to reset their external benchmark lending rates at least once in 3 months. Borrowers will see benefits once the lenders resets their benchmark rates, which can vary depending on the lender and customer profile,” he explains.Also Read | Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay?
