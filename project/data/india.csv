Rescue and relief efforts intensify

The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), fire brigade, police, and local volunteers are conducting ongoing rescue operations.

So far, 5-7 people have been rescued and admitted to nearby hospitals for treatment and observation.

Up to 10-15 people may still be trapped in the debris or underwater. Rescue teams are using specialized equipment to search submerged areas.

Maharashtra announces Rs 5 lakh aid for victims

Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis announced financial assistance of Rs 5 lakh each to the families of those who lost their lives.

In a post on X, CMO said the government will also bear the full cost of medical treatment for those injured in the incident.

Official response and monitoring

CM Fadnavis has been in constant contact with the divisional commissioner, district collector, police commissioner, and tehsildar.

He emphasized relief work is being accelerated and described the incident as a tragedy, extending condolences to the families of the deceased.

Authorities urged people to avoid speculation until more official information is available.

Cause and condition of bridge

The bridge was described as old and dilapidated, possibly contributing to its failure under the heavy crowd.

While no rain was reported at the time of collapse, preceding days of heavy rainfall had caused the river to be in spate, increasing water speed and volume.

Local impact and witness accounts

The collapse happened on a busy Sunday afternoon, increasing the number of affected individuals as the area is a favored spot for picnickers and tourists.

Locals played a role in rescuing some victims immediately after the incident before official teams arrived.

Search operations continue

Search and rescue teams are working late into the evening, combing the river downstream for missing persons.

NDRF teams have deployed equipment such as boats and diving gear to aid in underwater searches.

Safety and future measures

The incident has raised questions about the safety and maintenance of infrastructure in popular tourist spots.

Authorities are expected to conduct a thorough investigation into the cause of the collapse and will likely review other similar structures for safety compliance.

Bengaluru: When NEET 2025 emerged as one of the toughest editions in recent memory, many students were stumped in the exam hall. But despite the challenging paper, Karnataka produced several top rankers who shared their surprised reactions and the strategies they had employed in the preparation stage.Ruchir Gupta | Alpine Public School — AIR 22""It's my mother's dream that I become a doctor. Her parents are doctors, and I've seen for myself the service they do and the respect they command. For me, there's no other profession through which I can help people as much. I started preparing with Allen in class 11, but when I wrote the paper, all my hopes were shattered. It was so hard, I couldn't digest it wasn't going as planned. In the middle of the exam, I even thought of switching to engineering. .. The holidays afterwards were even more stressful than the preparation stage, and I ensured I was always engaged and didn't think too much about the exam. The rank of 22 was a big surprise,"" said Ruchir.Tejas Shailesh Ghotgalkar | Sri Chaithanya Techno School, Marathahalli — AIR 38Even though his parents were engineers, Tejas' interest always lay in medicine.""He likes to learn about the body, physiology, and he wants to do research on diseases, especially neuro-related ones that haven't yet found cures. It is a self-discovered interest. He used to watch a lot of series related to medicine while in school — both fictional and otherwise. His other interest is physics. He got through IIT Delhi's engineering physics programme. But his first choice was always medicine,"" said his father, Shailesh Ghotgalkar.Pranshu Jahagirdar | Bangalore International Academy — AIR 42""I want to lead a life with a purpose. At the end of my life, when I look back, I should have left a footprint in this world. When I started my preparation for NEET with Allen, I realised how difficult it is to crack the exam and understood I'd need intense preparation. I deactivated my social media accounts, barely went out with friends, and dedicated my time entirely to study. On exam day, the questions were so hard, but the stakes were so high. I almost went into a trance mode and started answering questions in the pattern we were taught to — minimising negative scores and maximising the marks,"" said Pranshu.Harini Sriram | Base PU College, Bannerghatta Road — AIR 72Medicine was always Harini's first interest, not engineering. ""I like the hectic and tight schedules doctors have instead of the regular working hours of an engineer. School, family, and friends were a big support system. Group discussions with friends helped as it made it easier to remember things. When the paper was tough, I tried not to panic, but I did. With that, time management became an issue. But I somehow managed, and the rank was unexpected,"" she said.Diganth S | Narayana NEET Academy Co Kuvempu Bhavan — AIR 80""I wanted to be a doctor as it is a direct way of touching people's lives. I prepared hard for the past two years. With the exam being difficult, I was expecting a rank below 200. I'm happy I could make it below 100,"" he said.Nidhi KG | Expert PU College, Mangaluru — AIR 84""Right from the start, I was aiming for a rank below 100. The paper was tough this time, but I gave it my best. For the past two years, I dedicated myself to my studies, staying focused on my goal.

Authorities are now monitoring the structure and will conduct a thorough investigation to determine the cause of the fire, which remains undisclosed.This is not the first fire reported at Marina Pinnacle — also known as Tiger Tower. In May 2015, a kitchen fire on the 47th floor had spread to the floor above before being contained.Despite the building's fire history, Saturday’s operation stands out for its scale, coordination, and zero casualty outcome — underscoring Dubai’s emergency preparedness.","A major fire broke out on saturday at the 67-storey marina pinnacle building in dubai marina, prompting a large-scale emergency response.

NEW DELHI: Seventeen-year-old Aryan Ansari was on the terrace of a building near Ahmedabad airport, casually filming planes to show his friends. What he ended up recording was the moment Air India’s Dreamliner 787-8 crashed and burst into flames, footage that has since gone viral across the country.“I came here on June 12. The plane was passing from very close, so I thought of shooting a video to show to my friends,” Aryan recalled. “The plane went downwards, and I thought it was going to land as the airport was nearby. But then flames started shooting up, I saw that it had exploded. I was scared. I showed the video to my sister. I also told my father about it.”Aryan was attempting to capture a regular flight in action, unaware that he would end up filming one of the deadliest aviation accidents in recent memory.Flight AI 171, bound for London, crashed shortly after taking off from Ahmedabad airport on the afternoon of June 12. Of the 242 people on board, only one person survived. Among the deceased was former Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani.Aryan’s video, which shows the aircraft descending rapidly and then engulfed in flames, is being widely circulated and has become a crucial record of the final moments of the ill-fated flight.Meanwhile, authorities have begun the grim task of identifying the charred remains of the victims. Ahmedabad Civil Hospital is relying on DNA and blood samples provided by relatives to match and release the bodies.“The bodies of 31 DNAs have been matched. 12 bodies have been handed over to their respective family members,” said Dr Rajnish Patel, Additional Medical Superintendent of the hospital. “We are waiting for others to come and collect the remains of their relatives.”","17-year-old aryan ansari was on the terrace of a building near ahmedabad airport, casually filming planes to show his friends.

Who is Arturo Gamboa? Armed man at Kings Day protest fired at by peacekeeper; bystander killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-arturo-gamboa-armed-man-at-kings-day-protest-fired-at-by-peacekeeper-bystander-killed/articleshow/121870857.cms,"AP





A peacekeeper at a ""No Kings"" protest in Salt Lake City opened fire on a man who raised a rifle at the crowd, but accidentally shot and killed a bystander, police said on Sunday.The incident happened on Saturday evening during nationwide ""No Kings"" protests, where demonstrators rallied against what they called president Donald Trump’s authoritarian actions. While most protests remained peaceful, violence broke out in Salt Lake City when a man, identified as Arturo Gamboa, 24, pulled out a rifle near the protestors.According to Salt Lake City police chief Brian Redd, two men wearing neon green vests, believed to be part of the peacekeeping team, approached Gamboa with their handguns drawn. Witnesses said Gamboa raised his rifle and moved towards the crowd. One of the peacekeepers then fired three shots, hitting Gamboa and a bystander, Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, 39.Ah Loo was taken to hospital but later died from his injuries. Gamboa, who was treated for minor injuries, was arrested and charged with murder. Police accused him of creating the dangerous situation that led to Ah Loo's death.The gunfire caused panic, forcing hundreds of protestors to flee, hide behind barriers and seek shelter in nearby buildings.Police recovered an AR-15 style rifle, a gas mask, and a backpack at the scene.Authorities are still investigating why Gamboa brought the rifle to the protest and how the peacekeepers were organised or trained for the event.In another incident in Riverside, California, a driver struck a woman participating in a separate ""No Kings"" demonstration and fled. The woman was hospitalised with serious injuries but is stable. Police are still searching for the driver.The Utah chapter of the 50501 Movement, one of the groups behind the protests, condemned Gamboa’s actions and thanked first responders and their safety team for acting quickly. They did not respond to questions about the peacekeeping team’s organisation or training.","A peacekeeper at a ""no kings"" protest in salt lake city opened fire on a man who raised a rifle at the crowd, but accidentally shot and killed a bystander.

NAGPUR: A simple act of courtesy and kindness — letting a sick teenager and her grandmother board the helicopter first — spared the lives of a Maharashtra couple from the fatal helicopter crash near Kedarnath on Sunday. Pooja and Pravin Mahajan, from Bhadravati in Chandrapur district, had been travelling with Pooja's sister, Shraddha Jaiswal of Wani in Yavatmal district, her husband Rajkumar, and their toddler daughter Kashi, who were among the seven killed when the chopper went down minutes after take-off.On Sunday morning, the group was waiting at the Kedarnath helipad with the Jaiswals for the first sortie to Gaurikund when an elderly woman in the queue requested that she and her unwell granddaughter be allowed to go first. Pravin agreed, letting Vinod Devi, 66, and Trishti Singh, 19, take his family's place in the queue and opting to wait for the next helicopter. Talking to TOI, Mahajan said, ""The woman requested that her granddaughter had fever and she needed to reach the Gaurikund base soon. I agreed and allowed them to board,"" he said.Rajkumar Jaiswal, 41, who was a prominent coal-transport businessman from Wani, had set out on the Char Dham yatra with his family on Thursday, fulfilling a long-held personal vow.The group reached the Kedarnath shrine at 9:30am on Saturday and was scheduled to return by noon. But due to severe weather, sorties were cancelled for the rest of the day. Flights resumed at 5am on Sunday. Two other helicopters took off around the same time and landed safely.In addition to his coal business, Jaiswal ran a retail shop and was known in his community for his devout faith and involvement in local affairs. His wife Shraddha, 35, and their 23-month-old daughter Kashi died alongside him in the crash. Their six-year-old son, Vivaan, had stayed behind in Maharashtra with his grandfather.

Patrick Mahomes’ heartfelt moment as a girl dad resurfaces and it’s melting fans all over again







Kansas City Chiefs superstar Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany Mahomes, recently melted hearts on social media by revealing the face of their youngest child, Golden, for the first time. The post, shared jointly by the couple on Instagram, marks the first public glimpse of baby Golden’s face since her birth five months ago, on January 12, 2025.The post featured a tender family moment, highlighting all three of their children — Sterling (4), Bronze (2), and the newest member of the Mahomes clan, baby Golden. Patrick, holding Golden gently in his arms, beams with pride as she sucks on her tiny hand, dressed in a white onesie and sporting an oversized white bow that made her look even more adorable. Another frame captures Brittany and Golden, with the little one flashing a radiant smile in a cute denim romper — a moment that quickly stole fans' hearts.True to their tradition, Patrick and Brittany had earlier decided not to reveal their children’s faces immediately after birth. The couple has always placed high importance on privacy, especially when it comes to their kids. But when they finally shared this sweet family portrait, fans couldn’t stop gushing over how grown and happy the Mahomes family looked.While many are surprised at how young Patrick is to be a father of three, the 29-year-old quarterback has always embraced early parenthood. “No, it’s awesome. I always wanted to have kids young. I got to grow up in the locker room. I think I’ve talked about it before, and it made such an impact on my life,” he once said.Despite his high-pressure role leading the Chiefs, Mahomes never lets family take a backseat. As soon as he wraps up on the field, he’s quick to head home and soak up every moment with Brittany and their children. Fatherhood, as he describes, changed him for the better. Initially, he dreamed of having a son first, but everything shifted when he met his daughter Sterling.“Growing up I wanted to have a boy first, then I had a girl & it’s like God knew exactly what to do with me. He helped me mature as a man. It’s a different bond with a daughter because you’ve got to be that protector,” Mahomes shared during a candid conversation with Tom Brady on NFL on Fox.With every public glimpse of their family life, Patrick and Brittany continue to redefine what it means to balance fame, love, and parenthood — one sweet moment at a time.Also Read: “It affects everything”: Taylor Swift’s alleged falling out with Blake Lively gets deeper — and Travis Kelce may be caught in the crossfire","Patrick mahomes and his wife, brittany mahomes, recently revealed the face of their youngest child, golden, for the first time.

NEW DELHI: In a few weeks, you may not need to provide photocopies of Aadhaar and will instead be able to share electronic Aadhaar, either in full or the masked version, using a new app based on QR code.And, by November, other than submitting your biometric details, you will not be required to visit Aadhaar centres to update address and submit other details as the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has lined up a new protocol that will draw from the birth certificate, matriculation certificate, driving licence, passport, PAN, PDS and MNREGA database to seek your address and other details to not just simplify life for citizens but also reduce the possibility of forged documents being used to get Aadhaar. Talks are underway to access the electricity bill database which will make it more convenient.UIDAI chief executive officer Bhuvnesh Kumar told TOI that a new app has been developed by the agency and around 2,000 of the one lakh machines have now moved to the new tool. ""You will soon be able to do everything sitting at home other than providing fingerprints and IRIS,"" he said. This will include updating addresses, phone numbers, name change and even rectification of a wrong date of birth.The move to allow QR code-based mobile-to-mobile or app-to-app transfer of Aadhaar is seen to be crucial to check against misuse and is proposed to be used for several purposes - from checking in at hotels to identity verification on a running train. ""It offers maximum user control over your own data and can be shared only with consent,"" Kumar said.This can also be used by sub-registrars and registrars at the time of property registration, where frauds often take place. Kumar said UIDAI is sensitising state governments to use Aadhaar to verify the credentials of those coming to register property, so that some of the frauds can be prevented.He said UIDAI has also initiated talks with CBSE and other exam boards to ensure biometric and other data updation of children, which is required to be done between five and seven years and again between 15 and 17 years. A special drive is planned so that the eight crore missing details for the first update (for kids between five and seven years) and 10 crore second update can be completed.Separately, UIDAI is also working with various players, such as security agencies, hotels, for covering entities that are not mandated to use Aadhaar.","By november, other than submitting your biometric details, you will not be required to visit aadhaar centres to update address and submit other details.

Kylie Kelce is no stranger to real, unfiltered conversations, especially when it comes to family. In the latest episode of her Not Gonna Lie podcast, aired June 12, the mom of four opened up about a deeply personal memory that revealed the bond she shares with her mother, Lisa McDevitt — whom she lovingly refers to as “Lil’ Lis. ”Joining forces with Olympic rugby player Ilona Maher, the episode unfolded into an honest discussion about how their mothers influenced their understanding of sex and communication. For Kylie Kelce, this comfort was rooted in openness from an early age. Recounting a moment that clearly stuck with her, she said, ""I bombarded her, and came in and sat in a room while she was doing something, and just was like, 'OK, Mom, here. We're here now.'""At the time, Kelce had made up her mind to wait until marriage to have sex. But her mother’s response was anything but conventional. ""I think I'm gonna save myself for marriage,"" she told her mom. The reply? ""I think you're gonna change your mind."" And that wasn’t even the punchline.Kelce laughed as she remembered her mom’s brutally honest follow-up. ""Lil' Lisa doubled down... She was like, 'Hey, you gotta test drive a car before you buy it, right?'""While the original plan didn’t pan out, Kelce said the point wasn’t about the decision itself — it was the freedom she felt in making it.“It made it less scary. It made it less risky,” she said, adding that being able to speak openly with her mom gave her a safer, more informed perspective on sex and relationships.Now a mother to four daughters — Wyatt (5), Elliotte (4), Bennett (2), and baby Finnley, born in March — Kylie hopes to build the same trusting dynamic with her own girls. She believes that kind of environment allows for real conversations about protection and safety. “With my mom, then I could talk about getting an IUD, I could talk about condoms and all that stuff with her,” she explained.Beyond the sex talk, Kelce also let fans into the chaos of raising four young kids. She joked, “If I had to describe the change going from three kids to four kids in two words or less: ‘Holy shit?’” Despite being a seasoned mom, she admitted she’s “still Googling things because that doesn’t stop, either.”For Kelce, authenticity and humor are part of the journey. Whether she’s parenting or podcasting, one thing is clear — the candid legacy of “Lil’ Lis” lives on.Also Read: Ex-girlfriend of Aaron Rodgers reacts after he confirms secret marriage: ""It's really just harassment""","Kylie kelce once told her mom she was waiting until marriage for sex.
