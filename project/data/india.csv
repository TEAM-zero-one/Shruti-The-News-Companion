India at Unesco shared the statement on microblogging site X, late on Thursday. Addition to the World Heritage Centre's tentative list is mandatory if a property is to be nominated for inscription to World Heritage List in future, it said.The six properties added to the tentative list include Kanger Valley National Park in Chhattisgarh; Mudumal Megalithic Menhirs in Telangana; serial nomination of Ashokan Edict Sites along the Mauryan Routes (multiple states); serial nomination of Chausath Yogini Temples (multiple states); serial nomination of Gupta Temples in north India (multiple states), and the palace-fortresses of the Bundelas in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, the statement said.With these additions, India now has 62 sites on the tentative list.

""The Chausath Yogini Temples have 64 images of Yoginis in their individual shrines with intricate stone carvings circularly arranged. These temples are mostly situated on hilltops. 'Yogini' refers to a female practitioner of yoga and 'chausath' is the Hindi word for the number 64. The Yoginis are 64 in number and hence called the Chausath Yogini. They are a group of forest spirits and mother goddesses,"" reads a description on Unesco website.""It is this embodiment of both alluring and threatening qualities, as well as the large number of goddesses from the group that identifies them as Yoginis,"" it reads.At present, a total of 43 properties from India are inscribed on Unesco World Heritage List, including 35 in the 'Cultural' category, seven in 'Natural' and one in 'Mixed' category.India hosted a World Heritage Committee meeting for the first time in 2024, during which the Moidams-the mound-burial system of the Ahom Dynasty in Assam-was accorded the coveted Unesco tag.","A set of six properties have been added to india's tentative list by unesco.

Burning rage or selective storm?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/burning-rage-or-selective-storm/articleshow/119014561.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

A year ago, I was invited to speak at a prison. Before the programme, I noticed a frail young man fixing a laptop. He looked like any other techie in a corporate office—small-built with inquisitive eyes, neatly dressed.

“I thought he worked here,” I said to the jailer, and swallowed my shock as the jailor called him over. The young man introduced himself as an engineer who was once a team leader at a tech firm. Work was demanding, but life was good—until that fateful night. “My wife and my mother never got along. One night, I returned home—exhausted, stressed and hungry. My mother was visiting the next day, and I had agreed to pick her up from the station without consulting my wife. My wife was furious. I tried to explain, but she wouldn’t be pacified. Something snapped inside me,” he said.

“Blood rushed to my head. I leaped at her like an animal, slapped her hard, and banged her head against the wall. She collapsed. Her eyes, frozen in disbelief, haunt me even now. A momentary rage shattered my life. My child is in her grandparents’ custody; I may never see her again. I don’t know what took over me in that moment. It wasn’t me.” He turned back to his work, a man forever burdened by the question—who was that stranger within him?

Life throws an endless supply of provocations at us-the impatient honking behind us at a red light; the maid taking off on an important day; an overlooked promotion. But for some, anger is not a flicker—it’s an inferno.

Though anger is listed as one of the deadliest of sins, for generations, some men wore their tempers like a badge of masculinity. A Tamil adage says, “The hand that strikes is the hand that embraces”. These are all extensions of the myths about anger – that it helps one succeed and inspires respect; that the supreme hand of the caregiver can hit the vulnerable under their care. But the reality is different. A short-tempered person may be tolerated but never loved.

They are a menace—to themselves and to those who endure their wrath. Anger is not just an emotion; it is a storm that ravages the body. Cortisol levels surge, the pulse races, blood pressure spikes, pupils dilate and sweat pours. Once, this response helped our ancestors fend off wild animals. Today, it fuels tragedies—a husband striking his wife over a trivial quarrel, a father lashing out at a child, a moment of fury obliterating a lifetime of love.

Science corroborates what wisdom has long warned: those who explode are 25% more likely to develop coronary artery diseases. Still, they take pride in ruling their tiny worlds with the assumed authority their anger gives them. It is equally interesting that even the most hot-headed individuals control their tempers before their superiors. Instead, the vulnerable become dumping grounds for bottled-up rage—children, spouses, aging parents.

Thiruvalluvar devoted an entire chapter to anger. He posed a question to those who claim to have tamed their fury:

‘Chellidaththu Kaappaan Sinam Kaappaan: Allidaththu

Kakkin En? Kaavakaal En? ‘

If you claim you are managing your anger, restrain it to those who cannot resist you.

If you boast of suppressing it with the powerful, how does it matter?

Before we pride ourselves on self-control, let us ask: does our restraint extend to those who depend on us, or do we unleash our wrath on them because we can? For anger, like fire, first consumes the hand that holds it.

BENGALURU: Forget Chandrayaan, Isro. If you really want to test lunar terrain, just get your mission vehicles to take a drive down Bellandur's crater-riddled roads! This was the new cry that echoed in the IT hub Wednesday.With deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar scheduled to visit Bellandur at 4pm, hundreds of residents hit the road at Devarabeesanahalli near Sakra Hospital. Waving placards that read, ‘No Need for Moon Mission, Isro — Just Drive Here!', frustrated residents chanted ""Beku beku, road beku."" That Shivakumar did not turn up only left them angry and frustrated.""This road has been in a terrible condition for the last six months,"" said Kusum Sahay , an elderly resident, adding, ""There are no pavements for pedestrians, and stepping out of a car itself is a challenge.""Venkat, another resident, fumed over the neglect of one of the city's key localities. ""We are the creme de la creme of Bengaluru, yet infrastructure here is cringe-worthy. This is a major road connecting Koramangala and Indiranagar — how hard is it to fix it quickly?""A resident of Mantri Espana highlighted the daily struggle. ""We moved here two years ago hoping things would improve, but nothing has changed. Just yesterday (Tuesday), I took my father to an eye hospital — a seven-minute drive took 20 minutes because of these crater-sized potholes. For elderly people, walking to Sakra Hospital is impossible. We are forced to take cars even for short distances, and that just adds to the traffic chaos.""Kanchana Ganeshan, another protester, recalled how she used to cycle on the lake road four years ago. ""Now, I wouldn't dare. What used to be a smooth ride turned into a bone-rattling nightmare. Every day, travelling just seven kilometres is an ordeal.""Rajesh Narka, representing Bellandur Rising 2025 initiative, called for swift action. ""Bellandur is home to some of the biggest IT hubs, yet the roads are in a shambles. We take pride in our city, but we cannot be expected to tolerate this mess. If the govt really wanted to fix this, it wouldn't have taken long.""Joginder Yadav, a resident, pointed to the irony of last-minute patchwork before the DCM's scheduled visit. ""BBMP suddenly laid gravel and sprinkled water just because a minister was expected. Illegal parking, footpath encroachments and lack of traffic lights make things worse. We pay our taxes — we contribute to nation-building. Even though many of us are migrants, the govt should remember ‘Atithi Devo Bhava' and give us basic infrastructure in return,"" he said.","Hundreds of residents hit the road at devarabeesanahalli near sakra hospital.

It's the government which suddenly felt that there was a need for a change and they wanted to implement their own script. This is up to the state government. So, I don't have anything to say about that. It's entirely up to the government,"" Kumar told news agency PTI.""My father was an MLA even before I was born.

The Karnataka High Court on Friday stayed the trial court's decision to take cognizance of the charges against former Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and three other accused in connection with a Pocso Act case . The High Court also stayed the summons issued to them, relieving them from personal appearances before the trial court.On February 28, the special court had issued summons for Yediyurappa, 82, and three others to appear on March 15 in connection with the case. The court had also taken fresh cognizance of the charge sheet filed by the Karnataka Criminal Investigation Department (CID).The case dates back to March 14 of last year when a complaint was filed by the mother of a 17-year-old girl, who alleged Yediyurappa of sexually assaulting her daughter during a meeting at his residence in Dollars Colony on February 2, 2023.Justice Pradeep Singh Yerur, who passed the interim order, noted that the matter required further detailed hearings. He also exempted the accused from appearing before the trial court until the next hearing and issued a notice to the complainant.Also read: POCSO case: Karnataka high court grants interim relief to former CM BS Yediyurappa The stay came after Yediyurappa challenged the trial court's decision to take cognizance of the case.Senior Advocate C.V. Nagesh, representing Yediyurappa, argued that the complaint was questionable, noting that the complainant and her daughter had met the Bengaluru Police Commissioner multiple times after the alleged incident without making any allegations. He also pointed out that key witnesses who were present at Yediyurappa's residence during the alleged incident had confirmed that nothing untoward had occurred.Nagesh further contended that the trial court had passed its order without thoroughly considering the facts of the case.However, Advocate General Shashi Kiran Shetty, representing the state, opposed the petition, arguing that the trial court had found sufficient grounds to proceed with the case. He stated that staying the order would negatively affect the prosecution’s case.The trial court’s decision to take fresh cognizance followed a February 7 order from the High Court, which had instructed the trial court to reconsider and pass appropriate orders on the CID's final report in the case.This order followed the partial allowance of Yediyurappa's petition challenging the Pocso Act proceedings against him. The High Court had also granted anticipatory bail to Yediyurappa.The CID filed a charge sheet in the case on June 27, 2023, before the Fast Track Court. The CID’s investigation alleges that Yediyurappa and the three other accused paid money to the victim and her mother in exchange for their silence.Yediyurappa faces charges under Section 8 (punishment for sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, as well as Sections 354A (sexual harassment), 204 (destruction of evidence), and 214 (offering gifts to conceal the offender) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).The other three accused – Arun Y.M., Rudresh M., and G.

Two ‘ forest watchers ’ at Kanha National Park in Mandla district of Madhya Pradesh have been arrested and booked under UAPA for alleged ties with Maoists, triggering unrest among forest staff. Many are seeking transfer for fear of getting caught between Maoists and police.‘Watchers’ are the ones who patrol the forest on foot, venturing into the deepest, most dangerous parts of the forest that others dare not. “Hamare logon ko tiger se dar nahi lagta saheb, police se lagta hai (We are more scared of police than tigers),” said a forest officer, expressing anguish over the arrest of two forest watchers.This has not only raised concerns about the infiltration of insurgent sympathizers within state’s wildlife sanctuaries, but left ground-level forest staff shaken.Ashok Kumar Lal and Santosh Kumar Lal, both 28 and from Mandla district, were arrested during a Maoist encounter on Sunday evening in which an insurgent was killed, said police.“Both of them were good patrol guards, always vigilant. What are they supposed to do? Maoists threaten to kill their families if they don’t help them and if they do, police arrest them for siding with anti-nationals. Watchers play a very important role in tiger conservation. They are indispensable as they patrol several hectares of dense forest on foot and unarmed,” said the forest officer, requesting not to be named.Mandla district police say the duo was caught ‘signalling’ information to Maoists on movement of security forces. From atop a hillock, they would whistle in a certain way or strike stones together as per a prearranged code to warn Maoists, say police.Forest officers maintain the duo was indeed ‘signalling’ to Maoists — but to collect their food and ration. “They were not signalling Maoists about movement of forces. It’s a wrong perception,” said the officer.“Forest watchers are in a Catch-22 situation, trapped between the threat of Maoists and police action. If they cooperate with Maoists to avoid retaliation, they risk arrest by police. If they refuse, they face violence from insurgents or suspicion from law enforcement,” said another forest officer.“Registration of cases under serious sections like UAPA against our people without analysing the situation is uncalled for,” he added. Insiders say that other forest watchers and field staff are now reluctant to work.Though Ashok and Santosh claimed it was their first interaction with Maoists, investigators say they have found handwritten notes and other evidence suggesting a much deeper connection with the insurgents. The two were not passive observers — they provided vital intelligence to Maoists about security force movements and facilitated supply of essential materials, say officers.Stationed in the heart of Kanha, the forest watchers held a strategic position to aid Maoists, allege police, pointing out that they not only compromised national security and endangered conservation efforts, but also dragged their colleagues under a cloud of suspicion as police now wonder how deeply Maoist sympathizers may have infiltrated sensitive areas.Kanha, one of India’s most iconic tiger reserves, is a symbol of conservation success. Moist movement has been reported in around 40% of the core area of Kanha, in areas bordering Balaghat. “We are now battling the expanding presence of Maoists within these protected zones. There are a joint camps of forest and police near Mukki in Kanha. Khatia has no such camp,” said a police officer.","Two ‘ forest watchers ’ at kanha national park in mandla district of madhya pradesh have been arrested and booked under uapa.

PUDUCHERRY: Union Territory of Puducherry will implement a three-language policy, home, school, and collegiate education minister A Namassivayam told the assembly on Thursday, refuting Congress’ allegation that Union govt was trying to impose Hindi through National Education Policy .“There is no imposition of Hindi. Students interested in learning a third language can choose one. It is not compulsory for students to learn Hindi; they can opt for a regional language instead,” Namassivayam said.Rejecting Congress member M Vaithianathan’s allegations, Namassivayam said, “It was Congress govt at the Centre that imposed Hindi in the 1960s, sparking widespread agitation in Tamil Nadu. Talk to your party high command to learn about the anti-Hindi agitation in Tamil Nadu.”In protest, members of DMK and Congress walked out of the House, only to return a few minutes later. Opposition leader R Siva condemned the govt’s decision, saying in a release that the people of Puducherry would teach a fitting lesson to AINRC and BJP for adopting the three-language policy.

Song of Songs

“Yes, and yours are, too—may the wine go to my beloved, flowing gently over lips and teeth. I am my lover’s. I am all he wants. I’m all the world to him! Come, dear lover—let’s tramp through the countryside. Let’s sleep at some wayside inn, then rise early and listen to birdsong. Let’s look for wildflowers in bloom; pomegranates are in bloom, fruit trees adorned with cascading flowers. And there I’ll give myself to you, my love to your love.”

“You cannot direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.”

Recently, I came across thefrom the Bible:How mesmerising it is to witness ancient poetry intertwining love and nature in vivid, symbolic words.Sangam literature too brims with such poetic brilliance., a collection of 400 songs of love, has a verse by an anonymous poet known only asIn the poem, a woman speaks to her friend about her love who belongs to a land where elephants graze on bamboo branches. One day, a guard throws a stone at the elephant. Startled, it leaves the bamboo branch, which springs back upright—just like a baited fishing hook stiffens when a fish is caught.The beauty of the poem lies in its subtlety:Love is never just an event; it is a quiet undercurrent, a moment so fleeting, yet so profound, when two souls realise their longing for each other. It is the breathtaking instant when a flower unfurls, a microsecond when hearts recognise they are tangled by the design of the universe.Yet, love is not always an easy journey. Even those bound by marriage often traverse disappointments.Thiruvalluvar, in his eternal wisdom, devoted seven chapters to love’s intoxicating spell. But he did not stop there—he penned 18 more chapters about life after marriage, where love meets the trials of daily existence.One of my favourite couplets from hiscaptures a woman’s poignant response when her husband insists on traveling to earn a living. Money is necessary, he argues and promises to come back soon. But for her, even theof separation is unbearable:In just two lines, Valluvar crafts an entire story. The woman does not care for his reasons or reassurances—she refuses to even engage in a conversation on separation.Maybe, as time wove its quiet lessons, she learnt to let him go. She would have suffered still, but love, though fragile, has its own fortitude. And yet, in their twilight years, when their hands clasped tightly, love may have reached its true zenith—not in its youthful urgency, but in the quiet knowledge of a shared life.Sometimes, we wonder if life is but a grand, repetitive play—scenes reenacted, destinies recycled. Do we not walk the same paths as our predecessors, playing the same roles in an unchanging script?But there is one thing that makes every life unique—As boundless as the canvas of nature, love is never the same. Every heart, every moment, every story, bears its own hue.Perhaps that is why Kahlil Gibran wrote:","Thirukkural with the times explores real-world lessons from the classic tamil text.
