'MOUs Close To 1L Cr': Himanta Biswa Sarma Seeks Investment As Assam Makes Davos Debut

Assam is going to witness a historic moment on Saturday as Prime Minister Narendra Modi will land at the Emergency Landing Facility (ELF) on Moran Bypass in Dibrugarh, where he will witness the aerial display of fighters, transports and helicopters.The ELF is the first of its kind in Northeast India. It has been specially designed and constructed in coordination with the Indian Air Force to support the landing and take-off of military and civil aircraft during emergencies. It will serve as a critical asset for emergency response, enabling quick deployment of rescue and relief operations during natural disasters or strategic requirements in the Northeast.Envisioned as dual-use infrastructure, the ELF is capable of handling fighter aircraft up to 40 tonnes and transport aircraft up to 74 tonnes maximum take-off weight.PM Modi will also inaugurate and flag off development projects worth over Rs 5,450 crore, aimed at strengthening connectivity, digital infrastructure, higher education and urban mobility in the North-Eastern Region.According to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), around 10:30 AM, the PM will land at the Emergency Landing Facility (ELF) on Moran Bypass in Dibrugarh.At around 1 PM, the Prime Minister will inspect the newly built Kumar Bhaskar Varma Setu across the River Brahmaputra.Later, at approximately 1:30 PM, he will inaugurate and flag off development projects valued at over Rs 5,450 crore at Lachit Ghat in Guwahati.Further, PM Modi will inaugurate Kumar Bhaskar Varma Setu across the River Brahmaputra, built at a cost of around Rs 3,030 crore. The 6-lane extradosed Prestressed Concrete (PSC) bridge connects Guwahati with North Guwahati and is the first of its kind in Northeast India. It will cut travel time between Guwahati and North Guwahati to seven minutes.Given the region's high seismicity, the bridge incorporates base isolation using friction pendulum bearings. High-performance stay cables have been used to ensure durability and long-term structural performance.A Bridge Health Monitoring System (BHMS) has also been incorporated to enable real-time condition monitoring, early damage detection, and improved safety and service life of the extradosed bridge.According to the PMO, PM Modi will inaugurate the National Data Centre for the Northeastern region at Amingaon in Kamrup district of Assam. The state-of-the-art Data Centre, with a total sanctioned load of 8.5 MW and an average rack capacity of 10 kW, will host mission-critical applications for various government departments and serve as a Disaster Recovery centre for other National Data Centres.This will enable governments in the Northeast to digitally deliver essential citizen-centric services. Aligned with the vision of Digital India, the National Data Centre for the northeastern region has been envisioned as a strategic initiative to strengthen the region's ICT backbone and ensure robust, secure, and always-available digital infrastructure, according to the PMO's statement.The inauguration of the Indian Institute of Management is another highlight for the state, as the IIM Guwahati is set to provide a major boost to higher and management education in the North-Eastern Region.Over 225 electric buses under the PM-eBus Sewa Scheme in Guwahati (100), Nagpur (50), Bhavnagar (50), and Chandigarh (25) will also be flagged off. With the launch of e-bus operations under the PM-eBus Sewa Scheme in these four cities, more than 50 lakh citizens are expected to benefit from access to clean, affordable, and reliable public transport services, thereby improving urban mobility and enhancing quality of life.","Pm narendra modi will land at the emergency landing facility (elf) on moran bypass in dibrugarh.

February 4 talks constructive: Ladakh chief secretary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/february-4-talks-constructive-ladakh-chief-secretary/articleshow/128331954.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ladakh chief secretary Ashish Kundra on Friday clarified on X that the Feb 4 discussions of the high power committee (HPC) on Ladakh — comprising representatives of the home ministry and Ladakh bodies like Apex Body Leh (ABL) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA) — were wholesome and constructive, and that the govt is committed to a process of democratic consultation which involves all stakeholders of the UT.“Contrary to speculative media reports on the ongoing talks in HPC, the Delhi meeting with ABL & KDA was cordial and constructive...Rumours and twisted narratives are avoidable at this juncture,” Kundra said on X.His reference was to a TOI report published on Thursday, suggesting that the Centre had made it clear during the Feb 4 talks that Sixth Schedule status or statehood shall not be granted to Ladakh which could, instead, be offered a “territorial council model”.KDA leader Sajjad Kargili too posted on X that “during the Feb 4 HPC meeting, no expression such as ‘rejection’ was used”. “The govt raised certain objections and reservations regarding our draft...We presented and defended our demands with utmost sincerity and clarity. The next step now rests with the Centre to place its proposal before us. At the same time, we have clearly conveyed our position that the proposal of Article 371 along with a territorial council is not acceptable to us,” he stated.In a TV interview, Kundra had said that while ABL and KDA had mentioned their demand for Sixth Schedule status in the HPC meeting, home ministry representatives explained that Sixth Schedule was inserted in the Constitution merely in context of the northeast, to protect the rights of minority tribes within a state/UT. “Nowhere else in the country is a whole territory under the Sixth Schedule,” he said.On statehood demand, Kundra said Ladakh’s internal budget generation is a mere Rs 1,000 crore. “Can Ladakh be run on this small budget? We have to think about GPF and pension liability of govt servants in Ladakh, which is currently borne entirely by the Centre,” he pointed out.","Ladakh chief secretary ashish kundra on friday clarified on x that the feb 4 discussions of the high power committee (hpc) on ladakh were wholesome and constructive. “contrary to speculative media reports on the ongoing talks in hpc, the delhi meeting with abl & kda was cordial and constructive,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128331954,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

"To impeach CEC, opposition likely to file notice when Lok Sabha reconvenes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/to-impeach-cec-opposition-likely-to-file-notice-when-lok-sabha-reconvenes/articleshow/128331637.cms,"Gyanesh Kumar

NEW DELHI: The opposition is likely to file for the impeachment of Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar in Parliament. The move, coinciding with the notice for no-confidence motion against Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, will further escalate tensions between the ruling camp and the INDIA bloc.Sources said the notice for impeachment will be aimed at the post-recess Budget session that starts in the second week of March. The demand for impeachment of Gyanesh Kumar has been pushed by TMC. The opposition had been staying clear of the demand, until now. As if to get back at the allies, TMC did not sign on the removal notice the INDIA bloc recently moved against Speaker Birla even while pointing out that it was not opposed to the move in principle.The INDIA bloc allies’ sudden push to heed Trinamool’s demand appears aimed at appeasing Mamata Banerjee and reinforcing opposition unity, while also maximising support for the removal notice against Speaker Om Birla when it comes up in March. A senior Congress member said, “It will happen soon. We are discussing the issue”.With a firm majority in both the Houses, Modi govt and BJP are unlikely to be bothered by opposition’s moves.However, it would be an unprecedented sight that two top constitutional posts would face simultaneous no confidence from opposition.TMC’s demand against CEChas a wide approval within the opposition camp, with virtually every regional party questioning the process of SIR of poll rolls in the states. Opposition has dubbed it as a BJP ploy to disenfranchise opposition voters to benefit the governing party. While the issue has been debated at length in SC, its reverberations have also been felt in Parliament.Moving against the Speaker, opposition has accused the LS Chair of acting on behest of the governing party, and not allowing opposition to have its say in House proceedings. The fresh bout of tension between the two camps was sparked by refusal of the Chair to let Rahul Gandhi quote from an unpublished book by former Army chief M M Naravane on the Chinese aggression of 2020. The issue derailed the LS proceedings for over a week.Speaker Om Birla has decided not to officiate till the removal notice is settled.","The demand for impeachment of gyanesh kumar has been pushed by tmc.

It also appointed advocate Nina Nariman as amicus curiae.Appearing for the petitioner, senior advocate Sanjay Nuli said the HC erred in interpreting that rigour of Section 498A applies even to a live-in relationship, even though the definition under the IPC section envisages action against the husband by the wife. Section 498A provides that ""whoever being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall be liable to fine"".Under it, cruelty includes dowry demands, and coercion and ill treatment.In the current case, Lokesh - a cardiologist - was married to Naveena in Feb 2000. It was alleged by another woman, Teertha, that she got married to Lokesh in 2010. In 2015, Teertha lodged several complaints with police against Lokesh, his mother, sister and a cousin, but these were closed.In 2016, Teertha lodged a complaint accusing Lokesh of attempting to burn her while demanding dowry, even though Lokesh's employer certified that on the day of the alleged incident, he was at his workplace - a hospital. She later lodged a domestic violence case against him. Lokesh filed a suit before a family court at Bengaluru seeking a declaration that there was no marital relationship between him and Teertha, which is still pending adjudication. In 2023, the police filed chargesheet against Lokesh for allegedly attempting to burn Teertha and demaning dowry. He challenged this before the HC which dismissed it.","A supreme court bench of justices sanjay karol and n k singh on friday entertained an appeal by a doctor, lokesh b h. he was challenging a karnataka hc order rejecting his plea for quashing prosecution launched against him based on a complaint filed by his alleged live-in partner.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128327073,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-128012,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Outside the House, however, some of the party MLAs generously praised the chief minister on Friday over his budgetary allocation for the annual Amarnath Yatra “Our CM’s move to allocate Rs 180 crore for Amarnath Yatra is a positive step,” Pawan Gupta, BJP MLA from Udhampur West, said, adding that it “reflects the changing times in Jammu and Kashmir”.Linking govt’s move to a broader sense of political and social transition in the region, Gupta said: “What we want at the end of the day is that Kashmir should join the mainstream, and slowly that is happening. In this Assembly, today you hear legislators saying they are proud Indians. Earlier, we mostly heard about special status.”The MLA said although BJP remained critical of govt on several issues, good and constructive decisions should be acknowledged.In his budget speech last week, Omar said his govt was deeply committed to ensuring the safety, comfort and spiritual experience of pilgrims visiting the holy cave shrine. He proposed to “further modernise pilgrimage infrastructure with an outlay of Rs 180 crore during 2026-27, in partnership with the Border Roads Organization, to improve road connectivity, emergency response systems and logistical support.” The initiative would ensure that the yatra became safer, smoother and more dignified for the pilgrims, he announced.Gupta said the chief minister’s current stance on the Amarnath pilgrimage marked a significant shift from the past. “Earlier, Omar Abdullah had different opinions about the yatra, but now his views have changed. As an Indian, it is my duty to appreciate this change,” he said.BJP legislator Balwant Singh Mankotia, too, appreciated the change in the CM’s approach, recalling in the Assembly how Omar had opposed such measures during the 2008 agitation, when he had stated that “not an inch of land would be given”.Another party MLA, Vikram Randhawa representing Bahu constituency, who had earlier in the day created a ruckus in the House alleging that Kashmiris were illegally settling on land belonging to the Jammu Development Authority, praised the CM for the budgetary allocation for Amarnath Yatra.","Bjp members miss no opportunity to corner omar abdullah govt over a host of issues.

NEW DELHI: A heated exchange broke out between Haryana minister Anil Vij and Kaithal Superintendent of Police Upasna during a district grievance redressal meeting on Friday after the officer declined to suspend a policeman in a land-related case, saying she did not have the authority to do so.The incident occurred in Kaithal where Vij, who holds the energy, transport and labour portfolios, was chairing the meeting. A local resident had levelled allegations against an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) in connection with a land sale matter that is currently under investigation.During the proceedings, Vij directed that the ASI be suspended. “I am ordering that till action is taken in the matter, he (the ASI) should be suspended because he can use his influence (in the case),” the minister said.SP Upasna responded that the officer in question belonged to a neighbouring district and was not under her administrative control. “I don't have the power to suspend him. The suspension order in this case can be issued by the Kurukshetra SP,” she said.Vij insisted that she act on his direction. “I am giving orders to suspend him (the ASI),” he told her, asking her to write to the Director General of Police (DGP) for necessary action.The SP maintained her position. “I can write this… But I cannot suspend (the ASI),” she said.As the exchange grew tense, Vij remarked, “In every work, you do like this. I am ordering you that he should be suspended. You write to the DGP… I am telling you, you only have to execute my order.”He added, “‘Mera order sare Haryana mein chalta hai’ (my order is applicable in entire Haryana),” drawing applause from some people present at the meeting, according to a video of the incident.The complainant, who was attending the session, also intervened, saying, “Madam, every time you do like this.”Sensing the situation escalating, Kaithal deputy commissioner Aparajita told the minister that the SP had agreed to write to the DGP. Vij responded, “You write to the DGP that he (the ASI) should be suspended… I will see who doesn’t listen (to the order),” pointing towards the SP.This is not the first time a disagreement has surfaced between Vij and senior police officials during grievance meetings.

‘Is There Any Law?’ Renuka Chaudhary Sparks Row After Bringing Stray Dog to Parliament

NEW DELHI: Congress Rajya Sabha MP Renuka Chowdhury has been served a privilege breach notice for bringing a stray dog into the Parliament complex during the Winter Session and for her remarks about fellow members.According to the notice, she has been asked to respond to the notice by February 23.The motion was moved by Rajya Sabha MPs Brij Lal and Indu Bala Goswami, who alleged that her actions amounted to a breach of parliamentary privilege and protocol.News agency ANI, citing sources close to Chowdhury, reported that she will respond to the notice in accordance with parliamentary rules, norms and conventions.The row began on the opening day of the Winter Session on December 1 when Chowdhury brought a stray puppy to the Parliament premises. She later explained that she had found the animal on her way to Parliament after witnessing a collision between a scooter and a car.“Is there any law? I was on my way. A scooter collided with a car. This little puppy was wandering on the road. I thought it would get hit by the wheel. So I picked it up, put it in the car, came to Parliament, and sent it back. The car left, and so did the dog. So what's the point of this discussion?” she said.Chowdhury maintained that there is no rule preventing an MP from bringing a dog or any animal into Parliament.The matter escalated after the Congress MP made controversial remarks while defending her action. In a swipe at the ruling BJP party, she said, “The real dogs are sitting in Parliament. They run the government. We take care of a mute animal, and this has become a big issue.”Earlier, when asked about the possible privilege motion, she responded by mimicking a dog’s bark. “Bhow, bhow… aur kya bolun?” she said, adding, “We will see when it (the privilege motion) is brought. I will give a 'munhtod' reply.”She also argued that there were more serious issues facing the country. “People are dying because of pollution and no one is worried… Labour laws are being forced upon us… but Renuka Chowdhury’s dog has rattled everyone. What can I say? I will continue to take care of animals,” she remarked.BJP MP Jagdambika Pal criticised her action, calling it a “tamasha” and a breach of protocol. He said members are not permitted to bring anyone into the premises without proper documentation and urged the Chairman to take action.“She is a member of the House and should raise issues of public importance instead of indulging in such drama,” Pal said.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also reacted to the controversy. “Dog is the main topic of today, I believe. What has the poor dog done. The dog had come here.

Lutyen’s Delhi: The eighth city

New Delhi turned 95 today, a milestone that binds two moments of power separated by nearly a century. On this date in 1931, the British formally inaugurated New Delhi as the imperial capital. Ninety-five years later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday marked a symbolic departure from that legacy by shifting the Prime Minister’s Office from South Block to 'Seva Teerth', a move framed as the final “unlinking” of the capital from its colonial inheritance.But New Delhi was neither born overnight nor unveiled through a simple ribbon-cutting ceremony. Its making was the culmination of two decades of planning, political calculation and imperial ambition, set against centuries of Delhi’s own recurring rise and abandonment.The decision itself was announced on December 12, 1911, when King George V stunned the Delhi Durbar by declaring that the capital of British India would move from Calcutta to Delhi. What followed was a slow, deliberate process that finally culminated in February 1931 with a week-long series of ceremonies inaugurating the new city.During those ceremonies, the then Viceroy dedicated the All India War Memorial Arch — now India Gate — on February 12, honouring soldiers who died in the First World War and the Third Anglo-Afghan War, their names etched into its stone.Three days later, another ceremony at the Government of India Camp recalled the moment two decades earlier when King George V and Queen Mary had laid the foundation stones of the new capital, each bearing the simple inscription: “15 December 1911. ”New Delhi’s creation was shaped as much by political necessity as by urban design. After the Swadeshi movement and the violence following the 1905 partition of Bengal turned Calcutta into a centre of unrest, the British Raj sought both administrative control and symbolic authority. It returned to a familiar strategy: anchoring power in Delhi, a city steeped in imperial memory.By doing so, the British were not creating something entirely new, but adding an eighth layer to a city that had already been built, abandoned and rebuilt seven times before. Modern New Delhi thus rose atop the ruins of earlier capitals and civilisations — and it was precisely this historical gravity that made Delhi the empire’s chosen seat.On a sunny, windy day, the Delhi Durbar that sprawled across 25 square miles near Burari had over 84,000 spectators. It was the coronation of King George V and Queen Mary as Emperor and Empress of India, following their crowning in Britain earlier that year.He also became the first reigning monarch to set foot on Indian soil. And it was for a reason.“We are pleased to announce to our people that, on the advice of our ministers, tendered after consultation with our Governor-General-in-Council, we have decided upon the transfer of the seat of the Government of India, from Calcutta to the ancient capital of Delhi,” George V announced, as mentioned in Sam Miller’s Delhi, Adventures in a Megacity.Why? Bengal's agitation made Calcutta a powder keg. Delhi's central location astride rail networks, Punjab's military recruits, and the Afghan frontier made it strategically superior for administration and defence.It also served as a power statement symbolically. Emperors from Pandavas to Mughals ruled here.King George V laid the foundation stones for the Viceroy's House, which is now Rashtrapati Bhavan and the Secretariat, which are the North and South Block buildings, adjacent to the Rashtrapati Bhavan, during the Delhi Durbar week.This grand gesture symbolised Britain's long-term commitment to ruling India amid growing nationalist unrest.The tale of Delhi’s seven cities isn’t some neat stack in one spot, but a history revolving around a central high point called the Aravalli Ridge.From Purana Qila to Mehrauli, the central Yamuna-facing plateau commanded rivers, trade routes, and monsoons. It was the ""magnetic North"" for power.Whoever held Delhi held India.In essence, Delhi's foundation began as a mythical forest settlement of Indraprastha and eventually grew into a medieval capital named after its rulers.Anangpal Tomar II and Prithviraj Chauhan turned Delhi from a series of scattered settlements into a fortified superpower known as the First City of Delhi.Lal Kot (The Red Fort of its time): Built by Anangpal Tomar II around 1060 CE, these were the original high walls of red sandstone. It was strategically placed on the rocky Aravalli ridge to make it nearly impossible to climb.Qila Rai Pithora: When the legendary Rajput hero Prithviraj Chauhan took over, he didn't tear it down; he expanded it. He wrapped the original fort in massive new walls, creating a sprawling urban centre that could house a massive army and 27 grand temples.Enter the Delhi Sultanate's first true urban innovator, Alauddin Khilji. He didn't just build a city; he built a fortified machine designed to survive both Mongol invasions and starvation.Facing constant threats, he shifted the capital to Siri, the second of the seven cities, and turned it into a logistical marvel.He built massive, 13-meter-thick stone walls to stop Mongol horsemen.To solve the water crisis, he excavated the Hauz-i-Alai, now known as Hauz Khas, a massive tank that captured rainwater to sustain the city through the dry season.This would later go on to become a poetic rivalry that history would remember.Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq was a man of stone and war. Unlike the previous rulers who built for beauty, he built Tughlaqabad, the third city, as a grim, sloping fortress meant to withstand the end of the world.While the ruler carried forward the legacy of the grand vision for Dilli, the beloved Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya was building a community well.The drama with Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya reached its peak here. Ghiyasuddin was so obsessed with finishing his city that he banned all labourers from working on the Saint’s stepwell or his baoli.And thus came the popular curse, ""Hunooz Dilli door ast"" (Delhi is still far off). But this was not all, he also allegedly whispered a second, darker curse regarding the city itself:""Ya base Gujar, ya rahe ujar."" (May it be inhabited by nomads, or remain a wilderness.)And thus, the city was abandoned almost as soon as it was finished.While returning from a campaign, Ghiyasuddin died when a wooden pavilion built by his own son, Muhammad bin Tughlaq, ""accidentally"" collapsed on him. He never spent a single night in his completed palace. Delhi was, indeed, too far.Despite the massive reservoirs, the area lacked a sustainable groundwater source. The water turned brackish and undrinkable. Disease and drought forced the population to flee back to the older cities. Within five years, the ""impregnable"" capital was a graveyard.Muhammad bin Tughlaq is history’s ultimate ""cautionary tale."" He was arguably the most learned man of his age—a mathematician, physician, and philosopher—but his brilliance lacked a pulse for human reality.He didn't just build the fourth city, Jahanpanah; he tried to re-engineer the entire concept of an empire.He built madrasas and hospitals, and famously, the Begumpur Mosque.But, in 1327, the Sultan decided that Delhi was too far north to manage his growing southern territories. He picked Daulatabad, today in Maharashtra, as the new centre of India. Most kings would just move their court. Muhammad bin Tughlaq ordered the entire population of Delhi to move.Old men, women, children, and even the sick were forced to walk as thousands perished during the journey, and Delhi became a ghost town.Two years later, he admitted defeat and ordered everyone to march back to Delhi. Thousands more died on the return trip. Those who made it back found a city that had been looted and reclaimed by the jungle.Firoz Shah Tughlaq was the ""calm builder"" of recovery. He established Firozabad, the fifth city of Delhi, and shifted the capital's focus to the riverbanks. The heart of this city was the Firoz Shah Kotla, where today stands the Arun Jaitley Stadium.But the ""idyll"" of Firozabad didn't last. A few years after Firoz Shah's death, the Central Asian conqueror Timur swept into Delhi.Timur’s forces systematically looted the city for days.He was so impressed by the architecture of Firozabad’s Jama Masjid that he spared the stone-masons, only to take them back to Samarkand as prisoners to build a similar mosque for him there.The transition from the Tughlaqs to the Mughals brought a new aesthetic to Delhi: the Persian style. This era was defined by a bitter rivalry between the Mughal Emperor Humayun and the Afghan lion Sher Shah Suri. They essentially ""co-authored"" the sixth city of Delhi, known today as Purana Qila.When Humayun took the throne, he wanted to create a city that reflected his love for astronomy, poetry, and Persian elegance. He began building Dinpanah, the Sixth City, in 1533. He chose the high ground near the Yamuna, supposedly the same spot where the ancient city of Indraprastha once stood.But his dream was cut short after Sher Shah Suri defeated him in 1540 and chased him into exile in Persia.Sher Shah didn't just conquer the city; he renamed it Shergarh. He tore down Humayun’s incomplete structures and rebuilt the fort with massive, ""masculine"" stone walls.Eventually, Sher Shah died in a gunpowder accident, and Humayun returned from Persia 15 years later to reclaim his throne. However, his ""return"" lasted only six months.This is the seventh city, the Delhi that most people still recognise today as Old Delhi.While previous cities were forts or strategic outposts, Shahjahanabad was a masterpiece of urban planning, designed to be the most beautiful city in the world.Shah Jahan moved the capital back from Agra to Delhi in 1639, bringing with him the peak of Mughal architectural refinement.He built the Red Fort, Jama Masjid and Chandni Chowk. However, the glory didn't last. Shah Jahan’s son, Aurangzeb, spent the last 27 years of his reign fighting endless wars in the Deccan.The final blow came during the revolt of 1857.Indian rebels took over Shahjahanabad, declaring the elderly Bahadur Shah Zafar their leader. The British besieged the city for months. When the British finally broke through the Kashmere Gate, they cleared a ""shooting space"" around the Red Fort, demolishing nearly 80% of the exquisite palaces and gardens inside the fort and the city to build ugly brick barracks.Following the 1911 announcement, Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker were tasked by the 1912 Delhi Town Planning Committee with a mad four-year deadline for 6,000 acres. What started as a then Rs 10 crore budget ballooned as World War I diverted materials and money to the front lines.The shift cost the British approximately £4 million at the time — estimated to be around £610 million today, or roughly Rs 7,528 crore in current value.Ironically, by the time the city was officially inaugurated in 1931, the British Empire was already crumbling. They built a ""City of Kings"" only to hand the keys over to the Indian Republic just 16 years later.The grand inauguration: Rain, sun, and imperial pompAfter 20 years' toil, festivities erupt in February 1931.The timing was almost cinematic. After three days of torrential rain, the clouds famously parted on February 10th. At exactly 11:00 AM, the sun struck the red sandstone of the Secretariats, signalling the start of the ceremonies.Standing in the Great Court of the Viceroy’s House, Lord Irwin and Lady Irwin unveiled the four Dominion Columns.The celebrations turned the city into a theatre of military and social might.The 2-mile stretch of Kingsway, the now Kartavya Path, saw the thunder of the British Indian Cavalry. Above, the Royal Air Force performed flypasts—a relatively new and terrifying display of modern power to the crowds below.Once the fireworks faded, the ""Paper Empire"" began its move. This was one of the largest bureaucratic shifts in history. Thousands of files, desks, and Babus (clerks) were moved from the humid streets of Calcutta to the dry heat of Delhi via special trains.By 1932, the ""Viceroy’s House"" was fully operational. The British had finally occupied their ""eighth city.""Today, the ""eighth city"" is no longer the city of Lutyens or the British. It belongs to the millions who migrated here in 1947, the dreamers from across the subcontinent, and the ghosts of the Pandavas whispering beneath the Purana Qila.As the Urdu poet Zauq once famously said, ""Kaun jaye Zauq, Dilli ki galiyan chhod kar?"" (Who would ever leave the streets of Delhi?)","95 years of delhi. Pm modi unveils seva teerth, a new pmo hub marking governance shift in national capital delhi.

Seva Teerth inauguration marks citizen-centric governance: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/seva-teerth-inauguration-marks-citizen-centric-governance-pm-modi/articleshow/128331326.cms,"'Symbols Of British Empire': PM Modi On North & South Block In 1st Address From Seva Teerth

NEW DELHI: After 78 years, the nerve centre of the central govt on Friday moved from South Block to Seva Teerth, the new sand stone structure now housing the PMO, following a cabinet meeting in the British-era building where proposals worth over Rs 1.5 lakh crore were taken up.The proposals included construction of an underwater road-cum-rail tunnel across the Brahmaputra, multiple highway and railway projects and a new Metro link in Noida, and approval of the Urban Challenge Fund to promote sustainable urbanisation.Speaking after the inauguration of Seva Teerth and two newly built Kartavya Bhawans, Modi said in the past 11 years, a new model of governance has emerged where citizens are at the centre of decision-making. “The decisions made here (new buildings) will serve as the foundation for advancing the ambitions of 140 crore citizens, rather than reflecting the will of a monarch,” PM said in a reference to the South Block’s colonial origins.The history of the PMO traces to a small PM Secretariat (PMS) in 1947 to provide basic administrative help to the PM.Modi said South Block and North Block, which till now housed important ministries like defence, home and finance, besides the PMO, were built to embody the ideals of the British Empire, but the new ones have been built to realise the aspirations of Indians.“It is important to remember that these structures were originally built as symbols of the British,” he said, adding that India’s capital moved from Kolkata to buildings on Raisina Hill that were built according to the wishes of the British royalty.He said as the nation moves towards a Viksit Bharat, it is vital that India sheds every trace of colonial mindset and the mentality of slavery. PM said renaming of places and roads, including Race Course Road and Rajpath to Lok Kalyan Marg and Kartavya Path, respectively, were not only a change of name, but an effort to transform the mindset of power into a spirit of service.Incidentally, on Feb 13, 1931, Delhi was inaugurated as the new capital of India after it was shifted from Kolkata. Urging govt employees to put in their best, Modi said India’s identity will not be defined only by its economy, but by the quality of governance, the clarity of policies, and the dedication of ‘karmayogis (employees)’. He said that every decision taken in the new buildings will shape the direction of a developed India by 2047 and that “2047 is not just a date, but the timeline of 140 crore dreams, where every institution, every officer, every employee, and every ‘karmayogi’ is significant”.He said Seva Teerth should become a symbol of sensitive governance where service is visible instead of power, commitment instead of position, responsibility instead of authority.","After 78 years, the nerve centre of the central govt on friday moved from south block to seva teerth, the new sand stone structure now housing the pmo.

NEW DELHI: Indicating the governing alliance’s support behind BJP MP Nishikant Dubey’s notice for a ‘substantive motion’ against Rahul Gandhi to expel him from Lok Sabha, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said on Friday that govt has dropped the idea to bring a proposal of its own against the leader of the opposition and will consult Speaker Om Birla on the next move once a decision on Dubey’s motion is made.“The motion govt wanted to bring has been dropped,” he said, noting that Dubey has given a notice for his motion against Gandhi for his alleged bid to ‘destabilise’ the country and attack its institutions in league with “anti-India” forces. The BJP MP has also asked that Gandhi be barred from contesting elections.Once the motion is accepted, the matter may be referred to the privilege committee or ethics committee, or may be directly taken up for discussion in Lok Sabha, Rijiju said.Rijiju had earlier said govt will submit a notice for breach of privilege against Gandhi for levelling serious allegations against PM Narendra Modi on the floor of the House in violation of rules and without authenticating his charges.He said Gandhi levelled a series of “baseless allegations”, including that the country has been sold, and raked up assertions made in an unpublished book of former army chief Gen (retd) M M Naravane in an illegal manner.Gandhi has struck a defiant tone, reiterating that he spoke the truth and accusing Modi of betraying the country’s interests in the trade agreement with the US. He has also been targeting the PM for his handling of conflict with China.Though his belligerent attack on the govt, of a piece with his hyper-aggressive campaign against BJP and Modi, has not paid much political dividend so far and has drawn fury from the governing alliance, the BJP-led NDA will be weighing its options against the issues political fallout.While cases exist of MPs facing corruption charges being expelled from Parliament at different points of time under ‘substantive motions’, which cover a wide range of matters that require voting, the kind of allegations against Gandhi place the issue in a different category.He was expelled from Lok Sabha in 2023 as well following conviction in a defamation case by a Gujarat court, but was reinstated after SC stayed the conviction.The fate of Dubey’s notice is likely to be decided once Parliament meets after the recess on March 9. As the first part of the Budget session ended on Friday, BJP slammed Gandhi’s conduct as “anarchic, undemocratic and politically uncivilised” in Parliament.“It is a matter of concern that Gandhi’s entire conduct is now becoming anarchic,” BJP’s Ravi Shankar Prasad said, alleging the Congress MP showed no respect for “norms, parliamentary procedures, constitutional proprietary and democratic traditions” during the session.",Kiren rijiju explains why modi govt paused privilege notice against rahul gandhi.

NEW DELHI : Taking a hardline stance for improving public faith in the integrity of justice delivery in trial courts, Supreme Court Friday said a district judge’s “spoken reputation” is an important factor for a high court in deciding to give him extension or retire him compulsorily.A Gujarat additional district judge was compulsorily retired in “public interest” in July 2016 on attaining the age of 56 years and nine months based on a report of a committee of three HC judges, who examined service records and recommended premature retirement of 18 judicial officers.The judge had unsuccessfully challenged his compulsory retirement before HC. In the appeal, his counsel Mayuri Raghuvanshi told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi the judicial officer is not contesting his compulsory retirement but challenging the ‘unfit’ tag which, according to him, was stigmatic.The bench said compulsory retirement is not a punitive action and assuaged the feeling of the judicial officer by saying that the remarks in the order compulsorily retiring him would not be an impediment to his entitlements to post-retirement benefits.However, the CJI had some harsh words for those with doubtful integrity in the justice delivery system. “If there is a report about doubtful integrity of a judicial officer and the HC is of the view that he should not continue in service, how can the SC interfere in that decision?” “Spoken reputation of a judicial officer is important to maintain public faith in the justice delivery system.Once a committee of judges casts a doubt on the integrity of a judicial officer and if a decision is taken to compulsorily retire him, then the benefit of doubt (about the correctness of the decision) should go to the institution and not the judicial officer,” the CJI said.The high court had said the service record of the judicial officer from 2000 till 2015 shows the case disposal was either ‘just adequate’, ‘inadequate’, ‘adequate’ or ‘poor’.“We have also noticed adverse entries in his confidential reports. There were three vigilance complaints registered against him, though they were filed. The petitioner was aware of all these adverse facets, and they have become final. At this stage, we cannot substitute the entries in confidential reports or assessments of disposal,” HC had said.“The office that a judge holds is an office of public trust. A judge must be aperson of impeccable integrity and unimpeachable independence… The standard of conduct expected of a judge is much higher than an ordinary man. This is no excuse that since the standards in the society have fallen, the judges who are drawn from the society cannot be expected to have high standards and ethical firmness required of ajudge,” the court had said.","A gujarat additional district judge was compulsorily retired in july 2016 on attaining the age of 56 years and nine months.

‘Justice Delayed Is Justice Destroyed’: CJI Kant Calls High Courts Key Guardians Of Citizens’ Rights

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday frowned on Himachal Pradesh HC's repeated interference in the state govt's decisions and said it appeared that the high court was not allowing the elected govt to function. SC warned that it would view such interference seriously in future.Despite these oral remarks, a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said the HC had rightly rejected the Himachal govt's reliance on the ongoing delimitation process to seek postponement of local body elections by six months.""Pendency of delimitation exercise cannot be a ground to seek postponement of elections,"" the bench said.It also said the HC was right in saying that holding timely elections to urban local bodies, municipalities and nagar panchayats had been mandated by the Constitution. There are around 3,500 gram panchayats, 90 panchayat samitis, 11 zila parishads and 71 urban local bodies in HP, the majority of which go to polls this year.Taking into consideration the logistics and problems of accessibility to remote areas in winter, the bench extended the HC's April 30 deadline for completion of local body elections by a month to May 31.Appearing for the petitioner, on whose plea the HC had asked the delimitation exercise to be completed before Feb 28, senior advocate Maninder Singh told the bench that the high court had set the deadline keeping in mind the fact that nation-wide Census work would commence from May 1. It was the state election commission that had cited this fact before SC, he said.For the state govt, senior advocate V Giri said the HC should have kept the logistics in mind while setting the deadline for completion of civic body elections.The CJI-led bench in its order said, ""The direction by the HC that elections to local bodies are required to be held after the expiry of their tenure as per constitutional mandate does not warrant any interference.""""However, having regard to logistic difficulties, we modify the time schedule and direct that all preparatory work be completed before March 31 instead of Feb 28. Elections shall be conducted within eight weeks thereafter, that is positively before May 31.
