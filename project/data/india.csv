As a result, several of them have deserted their units. Amid India-Pakistan tensions and Centre's directive to states to strengthen civil defence readiness , this could pose a serious concern.Data from the state civil defence unit reveals varying per-day allowances across states - Rs 732 in Delhi, Rs 590 in Rajasthan, Rs 565 in West Bengal, Rs 532 in Haryana, Rs 400 in Bihar, Rs 300 in Karnataka, Rs 250 in Jharkhand and Rs 200 in Maharashtra. Due to low pay, their number in Odisha has drastically reduced - from 21,000 a decade ago to merely 753 currently, sources said.

Pakistan airspace closure: Mumbai and Ahmedabad air traffic control save the day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-airspace-closure-mumbai-and-ahmedabad-air-traffic-control-save-the-day/articleshow/120922231.cms,"ANI file photo

<p>The longer route after Pak airspace closure on L639 guided by the Mumbai and Ahmedabad air traffic control<br></p>

<p>Typical route before Pakistan airspace closure<br></p>

What is the impact on airlines and is there an impact on the climate?

MUMBAI: Lima 639 and Lima 301 might sound like gobbledygook to most Indians, but these are the two air routes that along with the Ahmedabad and Mumbai air traffic control form the foursome that come to the rescue when Pakistan closes its airspace to India.Since April 24, over 130 westbound international flights taking off daily from northern and eastern airports such as Delhi, Amritsar, Chandigarh, Lucknow, Jaipur, Kolkata are being re-routed south where the Ahmedabad and Mumbai air traffic control assign them altitudes and put them onto L639 or L301 to overfly the Arabian sea and reach the Muscat airspace. Once there, they turn north to overfly Iran and complete the detour. In normal times, these flights after taking-off, turn west to cross over to Pakistan and show up on the radars of Lahore or Karachi air traffic control before they move into Iran.“Every time Pakistan shuts down its air space, Mumbai air traffic control gets a rush of re-routed flights overflying from north and east India. It happened in 1971 (Indo-Pak war), 1999 (Kargil conflict), 2001-2002 (post Parliament attack), 2019 (post Balakot airstrikes) and now post the Pahalgam terror attack,” said a retired air traffic controller. This time around, Mumbai air traffic control has been handling about 130 re-routed flights per day, while Ahmedabad handles about 80 affected flights, passing most of them over to Mumbai. These flights bunch up during peak hour, leading to dense traffic at certain times of the day such as 9.30 pm to 11 pm and 2 am to 3.30 am.The 2019 airspace closure was the most challenging one, overnight about 500 flights rerouted south and showed up in the airspace controlled by the Mumbai air traffic control. “All countries stopped using the Pakistan airspace. The current load is comparatively lighter with only about 130 additional rerouted flights, mostly belonging to Indian carriers,” he added.“The load was immediate and immense, too heavy for the then existent air routes to handle,” he said. The air route L639 was established, born out of necessity, during the 2019 Pak airspace closure. Of the six routes taken by flights from Mumbai to Muscat airspace, L639 is the most popular. “Since the rerouted flights come from the north, they try to catch the first available route to the west without overflying the Pak airspace and that’s L639,” he said.L639 starts overhead Bhopal , links to Ahmedabad, Mundra, overflies the Arabian sea to end at a way point (a navigational checkpoint at a specific location in space) called “RASKI”, near Muscat. L301, runs about 150 nm south of L639 and converges at RASKI. Along these two air routes, traffic has been dense following the Pak airspace closure. Aircraft flying west__ from India to US, Europe, that is__ are assigned even-numbered altitudes and they cruise at 30,000 feet, 32,000 feet, 34,000 feet etc up to about 42,000 feet. Aircraft flying from west to east into India are put on odd-numbered flight levels such as 29,000 feet, 31,000, 33,000 feet etc. Then again, along each flight level or altitude on L639 and L301, aircraft are lined up one behind the other, separated by 20 nm (37 km).Along most other air routes that fly over the sea, a horizontal separation of 50 nm is maintained between aircraft flying on a given flight level. But in the past few years, the Mumbai air traffic control, in a providential move, put procedures and practises in place that has enabled them to reduce the horizontal separation on L639 and L301. In Jan trials were complete, and L639, L301 became the first two air routes in Asia Pacific to afford a reduced horizontal separation of 20 nm. “With the reduced separation, more aircraft can be accommodated on each altitude,” he added. But the traffic density has been so high on these two routes that flights going from Mumbai to places like Shamshabad, Pune, Nagpur, Kolkata are being put on routes that are 50 nm or 100 nm south of L301, so these flights have been indirectly hit by the closure, he added.In the world of air transportation, permitting a foreign airline’s flight to overfly your country’s airspace is the most basic of the privileges one country can grant another. The UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) terms it the `First Freedom Right’. These involve only overflying flights. They cruise at over 29,000 feet and don’t land in the country where they have only the first freedom right. These overflying flights are handled by the `en route controller’. Mumbai’s enroute control normally handles about 2500 overflying flights in 24 hours. Mumbai had five frequencies or sector on which overflying flights contact the enroute controller. For instance: pilots of flights coming from north tune into 132.7 MHz to speak to the en route controller.The en route controllers of Mumbai and Ahmedabad then are the officials ensuring the traffic continues to flow from India to the west. The Ahmedabad air traffic control is part of what’s called the ‘Mumbai FIR’ or Flight Information Region. It’s essentially a defined airspace that is manned by the Mumbai air traffic control. All airspace in the world is divided into FIRs. India has five FIRs with the Mumbai FIR covering airspace over Gujarat, Maharashtra, and a large swathe of the Arabian sea. The entire backend operation of handling the flights re-routed due to Pak airspace closure then is handled by the Mumbai FIR.With airlines flying longer routes to circumvent the Pak airspace, the fuel burn is more and so are the carbon emissions. A Delhi-New York B777 flight overflying Pak airspace typically burns about 106,500 kg of fuel. While that adds to the cost, the other side-effect because of the higher fuel consumption is increased carbon emissions. For the said 106,500 kg of fuel the aircraft emits about 336 metric tons of carbon dioxide. But a re-routed B777 flight that avoids Pak airspace, takes the L639 route, does a refuelling halt in Vienna, burns about 125,500 kg of fuel, which is roughly 396 metric tons of carbon dioxide. (these are rough estimates, wind speed, direction, routing etc affect these numbers).","Since april 24, over 130 westbound international flights taking off daily from northern and eastern airports are being re-routed south. Ahmedabad and mumbai air traffic control assign them altitudes and put them onto l639 or l301 to overfly the arabian sea and reach muscat airspace.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120922368,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-467376,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
"Sirens, sporadic power cuts: Delhi set for security drill at 4pm today",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sirens-sporadic-power-cuts-delhi-set-for-security-drill-at-4pm-today/articleshow/120947871.cms,"Capital to simulate air raids, evacuations

NEW DELHI: A drill to check Delhi's preparedness for emergency situations such as air raids, blackouts and evacuations in case of attacks is all set to take place in 55 locations across the capital at 4pm Wednesday, as part of a national exercise.Under ' Operation Abhyaas ', air-raid sirens will be sounded and residents will be trained on evacuation protocols, and search and rescue operations, among other measures.While a total blackout may not take place as it will require coordination with the Northern Powergrid and may bring the city to a standstill, officials said sporadic power cuts may be carried out in pockets.In Ghaziabad, sirens will go off twice, at 10am and 8pm. In Gurgaon, a voluntary ""blackout"" will be observed between 7pm and 8pm. Noida, which does not have a civil defence unit, will have a different drill.The drill is aimed at gauging how quickly the civilian population responds to an emergency, such as an air strike, in a war-like situation.The directive for the drill came from the Union home ministry in light of “new and complex threats” emerging due to heightened tensions with Pakistan following the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, where 26 civilians — 25 of them tourists — were shot dead on April 22.Officials said the drill will take place simultaneously at 55 locations across the 11 districts of the capital. These will include educational institutions, markets, residential pockets, housing societies, hospitals, and govt installations. More than 7,000 Civil Defence volunteers and 1,800 Aapda Mitras, who are trained in disaster response by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), will be at the forefront of the drill, along with local police, traffic police, fire services, and home guards, besides the departments of revenue, health, transport, education, and power, among others.CM Rekha Gupta said the national capital was “fully prepared” for the drill. “Every activity is being undertaken as per the directions of the Centre,” she said. A senior revenue department official said the exercise will be a test of how well-oiled, robust, and alert the civil defence mechanism is.The day will start with special training programmes for students in 660 schools – 550 private and 110 state-run – on disaster response. Officials said a demonstration video has been shared to help schools understand how to conduct a drill.The directorate of education issued a circular Tuesday, directing schools to ensure full participation in the drill and to cooperate with the visiting DDMA teams “in the right spirit, with the aim of promoting a culture of safety, preparedness and civic responsibility among students”. Officials added that the drills will continue and training will be imparted to students in all schools over the next fortnight.Volunteer platform Yuvamanthan will depute teams to assist schools with the awareness programmes and basic drills for hostile threat preparedness, an official said. “The demonstration video shared with the schools shows teachers responding to an alarm by closing doors, windows and curtains, and switching off electrical appliances. Students are instructed to take cover under their desks or near walls, protecting their heads with their school bags and hands. Senior students will also be trained to guide the younger ones and help maintain calm,” said an official.The civil defence exercise will also involve the district controller, various district authorities, civil defence wardens and volunteers, home guards (both active and reservists), as well as members of National Cadet Corps (NCC), National Service Scheme (NSS), Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan (NYKS) and students from schools and colleges. The directorate of education has asked all govt and private aided schools to submit a report, along with photographs of the drill, to their respective district education offices on Wednesday.The drill for civilians will begin in the evening. Standard operating procedures have been distributed to all departments, resident and market associations, and institutions, and a communication strategy has been developed, an official said. Civilians will familiarise themselves with the sounds of the air-raid siren — long wails for alerts and short bursts for all-clear — identify nearest shelter locations such as basements, underground car parks or designated safe zones and keep ready items such as a torch, emergency kit and water bottles, among others, the official said. “Following the drill, we will carry out a complete assessment of the state of equipment and communication devices,” an official said.","Capital to simulate air raids, evacuations and blackouts.

Police won't interfere in BBMB ops, Punjab's counsel assures HC

CHANDIGARH: Punjab and Haryana high court Tuesday urged restraint from both Punjab and Haryana over their water-sharing dispute , saying: ""We do this to enemy nations - let us not do it to our own states.""The division bench of CJ Sheel Nagu and Justice Sumeet Goel made the oral observation while hearing a petition filed by Bhakra Beas Management Board , which alleged a forcible takeover of Nangal dam and Lohand control room by Punjab police.

BBMB's counsel Rajesh Garg said Punjab had deployed 55 police personnel - up from the usual 15 - and taken over dam operations without justification. ""Instead of arm twisting, Punjab govt should approach central govt,"" Garg said, calling the move unprecedented. He cited an email from BBMB's chief engineer confirming the takeover and referenced a Delhi HC judgment mandating the board supply 1,049 cusecs of water daily to Delhi.The court was told that political party workers had been present at the dam ""to trouble the operations"" and that Punjab was using the pretext of security to exert control. Punjab countered that law and order is a state subject and, given rising Indo-Pak tensions, it had acted to secure a sensitive installation.Additional solicitor general Satya Pal Jain, representing Centre, said BBMB resolution remains valid and that Punjab should challenge it through legal channels rather than obstruct operations. ""What if tomorrow Himachal Pradesh, from where the water originates, decides to block it?"" he asked.BBMB has requested the deployment of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF), such as CISF, to secure the dam.

Report mentions 'mysterious disappearance of unburnt cash'

NEW DELHI: The three-judge inquiry panel's damning report to CJI Sanjiv Khanna has confirmed that a huge amount of cash was found in a storeroom at Justice Yashwant Varma's Tughlaq Crescent residence on March 14, a finding that negates the judge's strenuous claim to the contrary.The report repudiates Justice Varma's repeated statements claiming innocence about the discovery of money from a room within his official residence. Adhering to the principle of natural justice, CJI sent the report to the judge & sought his response within two days. The CJI, who retires on May 13, appears firm on taking the issue to its logical end.In its lengthy report, the panel comprising Punjab and Haryana CJ Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Justice Anu Sivaraman unequivocally said a huge stash of cash was indeed found in a room on the premises of the judge's residence by the first responders to a fire incident there. The panel, which examined 50 witnesses, including Delhi Police commissioner, Delhi Fire Services chief and staff as well as securitymen deployed at his house, said most witnesses present at the site on March 14 confirmed that a portion of the cash stashed in the room had caught fire when Justice Varma was in Bhopal.Sources said the probe panel report mentioned the mysterious disappearance of unburnt cash, as seen by security guards posted at judge Yashwant Varma's bungalow, from the room. Delhi HC CJ D K Upadhyay had also referred to the vanishing cash in his report to CJI Khanna on March 21.When Justice Upadhyay had shown the video of burning cash in the storeroom to Justice Varma, the latter had ""expressed apprehension about some conspiracy against him"". The videos and photographs of burning cash, given to the Delhi HC CJ by the police commissioner, were handed over to CJI Khanna only on March 20, six days after the incident.The Delhi HC CJ remained unconvinced by Justice Varma's defence and had told CJI Khanna that ""the entire matter warrants a deeper probe"". The CJI constituted the inquiry panel on March 22 and the SC collegium repatriated Justice Varma to Allahabad HC the same day with the instruction that he be not given any judicial work.The inquiry panel also examined call data records of Justice Varma's phones. In his response, Justice Varma had said, ""I state unequivocally that no cash was ever placed in that storeroom either by me or any of my family members and strongly denounce the suggestion that the alleged cash belonged to us. The very idea or suggestion that this cash was kept or stored by us is totally preposterous."" He had also said that after arriving from Bhopal on the evening of March 15, he had inspected the storeroom and found no cash there.He persisted with the denial even when the video and photographs of burning cash were uploaded on the SC's official website. ""I was totally shocked to see the contents of the video since that depicted something which was not found on site as I had seen it.

Poll Do you think the historical context of property claims should be considered in modern legal cases? No, laws should be applied as they are. Yes, history matters.

NEW DELHI: Sultana Begum , who claims to be the geat-granddaughter-in-law of the last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar , broke down in disappointment on Monday after the Supreme Court dismissed her plea seeking possession of the Red Fort .The court, led by Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar, dismissed her petition as “completely misconceived.” The bench said, “Why only Red Fort? Why not Fatehpur Sikri? Why leave them also.”The ruling came as a final blow to Begum, who has spent years trying to reclaim what she says is her rightful ancestral property.Speaking to ANI news agency with visible emotion, she said, ""I did not mention Lal Qila (Red Fort), I only sought possession of Bahadur Shah Zafar's house. I don't know whether it is Lal Qila (Red Fort), Zafar Mahal or Fatehpur Sikri...that the government knows...I was hopeful that I would get justice from the SC, but today that hope has shattered. Now, where should I go? Should I go and beg now or defame him? What should I do? Bahadur Shah Zafar did so much for his nation; he sacrificed his son, his crown was taken, but he never betrayed his country...I got an offer of help from so many countries, but I said that I will not leave my nation. I am completely shattered after this...Those who betrayed their country are living a lavish life, and the man who was loyal to his country, his family is suffering today...There is no one to listen to us...I denied the public's help because I had faith in the SC. But now, when no options are left, I will get help from the public...""Begum had approached the apex court after the Delhi high court rejected her plea in both 2021 and 2024. The high court had cited an “inordinate delay” of over 150 years in bringing the matter to court.In her petition, Begum said that the Red Fort was taken from her family after the 1857 revolt against East India Company , when the British exiled Bahadur Shah Zafar and seized control of the property.She claimed the central government is now the “illegal occupant” and sought either possession or financial compensation for its use since 1857.Begum also stated that her late husband, Mirza Muhammad Bedar Bakht - believed to be the great-grandson of Zafar - was officially recognised by the Nehru government in 1960 and granted a political pension. She married him in 1965 and received a pension after his death in 1980.Now, with the Supreme Court closing the door on her legal claim, Sultana Begum says she has no choice but to turn to the public for support.","Sultana begum claims to be the geat-granddaughter-in-law of the last mughal emperor bahadur shah zafar.

NEW DELHI: Limited flushing and desilting of reservoirs of two run-of-the-river hydro-power projects - Baglihar and Salal - on the Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir—are being undertaken by India in an immediate move to prepare them for storing and regulating flow of water to Pakistan during the winters. More dams will undergo the process in coming days to ensure better storage in India.The move is part of the country’s detailed roadmap, prepared after suspension of the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) following the Pahalgam terror attack last month, to prevent and regulate flow of western rivers - Indus, Jhelum and Chenab - to the neighbouring country.Flushing is a process to clear sediments from the reservoir by operating it in a particular way using high water flow whereas desilting can be done through dredging to remove large deposited sediment.“Since the Treaty is on pause and there is no obligation to follow its provisions, we may do flushing on any project without any obligation. It will ensure longer effective life of such projects,” Kushvinder Vohra, former chairman, Central Water Commission, told TOI.He said typical projects like Baglihar and Kishanganga with smaller live poundages may complete the flushing process in about one to two days.Desilting/flushing of reservoirs is part of short-term measures under the roadmap whereas expediting under construction hydro-power projects such as Pakal Dul (1000 MW), Ratle (850 MW), Kiru (624 MW) and Kwar (540 mw) would be the medium-term measure.Curbing flow of nine cusecs of water from Kishanganga as required as per earlier award and using it for production of more power for India would be another measure that can be taken up in short-term, Vohra said.There are four more power projects which are in the pipeline as long-term measures which will make it possible for India to utilise adequate water from the western rivers using accompanying reservoirs. These projects will not only increase India’s hydro-power capacity in Jammu & Kashmir from nearly 4,000 MW to over 10,000 MW but also increase the water storage capacity which can be used in the UT and neighbouring states.Other measures under the roadmap include taking up Tulbul project on Jhelum which was stalled earlier; works on Wuller lake and Jhelum for better flood management; lift projects which may take comparatively lesser time to use water; and adequate use of existing Ranbir and Pratap canals to ensure more water for Jammu region.“Many other things can also be done which may unfold at an appropriate time,” said Vohra.","Flushing and desilting of reservoirs of two run-of-the-river hydro-power projects on the chenab river in jammu and kashmir.

As she lists one mansion, Taylor Swift transforms another possibly for life with Travis Kelce

After taking some well-earned time off, Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift are slowly easing back into their busy schedules. Following the Kansas City Chiefs ’ Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in February and the conclusion of Taylor’s monumental “The Eras Tour,” the couple took a step back from the spotlight to relax and reconnect in private.As Swift renovates her Rhode Island mansion into a potential family home, Kelce is back to training for what could be his final NFL season while also upgrading his lifestyle to match their evolving relationship.Taylor Swift is already focused on her next musical chapter, with a new album in development and plans reportedly underway for a 2026 tour, according to sources. Meanwhile, she’s also making moves in real estate, listing her former Cape Cod mansion owned briefly between 2012 and 2013 for sale.The most notable step is Taylor Swift’s decision to renovate her $17.75 million mansion in Watch Hill, Rhode Island. This historic 12,000-square-foot estate, perched on a scenic coastal cliff, is undergoing a $1.7 million transformation to become a primary residence. The upgrades include expanding the bedroom suite and lounge by 400 square feet, redesigning the kitchen, and adding a new bedroom.The living room is also being remodeled, and the front portico will be reconstructed. Permits were quietly filed in late 2024, with construction expected to finish by the end of 2025. Sources suggest Swift envisions this property as a future family retreat with Kelce.Now, as the off-season winds down, Travis Kelce is back at the Chiefs’ training facility, gearing up for what many believe could be his final NFL season. With a decorated career behind him, this upcoming chapter is set to be both meaningful and emotional.Alongside his return to football, Travis Kelce is also continuing his popular podcast, New Heights, which he co-hosts with his older brother and former Philadelphia Eagle, Jason Kelce. The podcast has become a fan favorite, offering a candid and often humorous glimpse into their lives both on and off the field.Parallel to Swift’s efforts, Travis Kelce is also making big changes to accommodate their shared future. In response to safety concerns following a high-profile burglary at his Kansas City mansion where over $100,000 in valuables were stolen Kelce has significantly enhanced the security of his home. He installed a $40,000 alarm system, multiple CCTV cameras, motion detectors, and floodlights.Additionally, he built a fortified safe room and an underground man cave. Two guard dogs, costing $9,000, and 24/7 private security at $6,000 per month have also been added. These improvements are largely aimed at ensuring Taylor Swift feels safe during visits, especially given the intense public and media attention surrounding their relationship.Beyond these two main properties, Swift is reportedly eyeing new real estate in Nashville and Kansas City. Nashville, her long-time base, offers proximity to family and friends, while Kansas City would place her closer to Kelce during the NFL season. Sources indicate that the couple may even be considering purchasing a home together in Kansas City, a move that strongly suggests they are planning for a more settled, domestic life.Also Read: “External forces trying to unbalance them”: Living Nostradamus claims cosmic fate ties Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, warns of looming challenges ahead All these developments point to a serious turn in their relationship.

"Taylor Swift pregnancy rumors—fans think she’s hiding a baby, but insiders say there’s a very different reason for her silence",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/taylor-swift-pregnancy-rumorsfans-think-shes-hiding-a-baby-but-insiders-say-theres-a-very-different-reason-for-her-silence/articleshow/120915097.cms,"Amid a noticeable absence from the public eye, pregnancy rumors swirl among fans (Getty Images)

Taylor Swift rumors prompt expert response on body assumptions

Rumors about Taylor Swift being pregnant have recently gained momentum, largely sparked by viral videos from her Eras Tour and social media speculation . A particular video showing Swift with what some perceived to be a “baby bump” led fans to question whether she might be expecting. However, despite the buzz, there is no solid evidence or confirmation to support these claims.As rumors about Taylor Swift's possible pregnancy swirl, experts are urging caution. Medical professionals stress that it's impossible to confirm pregnancy based on video footage alone, highlighting the need for privacy and respect.Dr. Annie Frenkel, a well-known OB-GYN stated, “You cannot tell from a video whether or not a woman is pregnant. Period, end of discussion.” She emphasized the importance of respecting privacy and not making assumptions about a woman's body based on vague visuals.Adding another layer to the story, Swift was recently photographed holding what appeared to be an alcoholic drink while spending time with friends Brittany Mahomes and Lyndsay Bell. Bell is currently pregnant, and the contrast between the two women in the image led fans to believe Swift may have been subtly addressing the rumors. Many interpreted the drink as a quiet way of saying she’s not pregnant, without making any direct statement.This isn’t the first time Swift has spoken out against public scrutiny of women’s bodies. Just last year, she defended Lady Gaga when similar pregnancy rumors emerged about the pop star. In a supportive comment on Gaga’s TikTok, Swift wrote, “Can we all agree that it’s invasive and irresponsible to comment on a woman’s body?” Her stance was clear: no woman owes the world an explanation about her body, and the public should refrain from such invasive speculation.Despite ongoing gossip, neither Swift nor her representatives have confirmed or acknowledged the pregnancy rumors. Instead, she continues to focus on her music and global tour, showing no signs of addressing the chatter directly.After wrapping up her record-breaking Eras Tour in December 2024, Taylor Swift's plans included spending time with Travis Kelce during the NFL off-season, enjoying some much-needed downtime together.Reports suggest that Swift planned a surprise private vacation for Kelce following his intense Super Bowl season, and the couple has reportedly been frequenting ski resorts where they can keep a low profile. A source told Life & Style, “They’re still very much in love. They ‘re simply recharging their batteries.”“They’ve been hitting the slopes and blending right in.” the source shared. “They love the anonymity.” Aside from their appearance at the Grammy Awards in February, which was one of the only major public outings since the tour ended, Swift and Kelce have kept their relationship largely private, clearly enjoying a quieter, more private phase of their lives.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s legal feud with Blake Lively reportedly destroyed Travis Kelce and Ryan Reynolds’ bromance In conclusion, the current pregnancy rumors surrounding Taylor Swift are based on speculation, not fact. Visual assumptions and social media whispers do not amount to confirmation, and Swift’s past and present actions suggest she values privacy when it comes to her personal life. Until an official statement is made which seems unlikely it's safe to say these rumors are unfounded and largely driven by the internet's tendency to overanalyze.","Taylor swift rumors prompt expert response on body assumptions.

Poll Should there be stricter regulations on conduct in schools? No, it's a rare incident Yes, absolutely

NEW DELHI: A school in Madhya Pradesh turned into a scene of chaos after a heated argument between the principal and the librarian exploded into a physical fight- with slapping, hair-pulling, and smashed phones - all captured on camera.The video of the incident that occured last week, now viral on social media, shows the two women clashing inside the premises of Eklavya Adarsh Awasiya Vidyalaya in Khargone, about 300 kilometres from Bhopal.In the footage, librarian identified as Madhu Rani is seen arguing with principal Praveen Dahiya over the division of duties. The situation escalates rapidly when Dahiya slaps the librarian, grabs her phone, and smashes it on the ground.“Madam, how dare you? Aap ne mujhe thappad kaise maara? Aap ki himmat kaise hui? (how did you slap me? How dare you) ” Rani shouts, accusing the principal of breaking her phone. However, Dahiya is seen picking it up and throwing it again.The principal then begins recording on her own phone, prompting the librarian to slap her back. What follows is a full-blown altercation - the two women pull each other’s hair and trade blows. “How dare you touch me?” yells the librarian, while the principal repeatedly claims she acted in “self-defense.”In the background, a young boy - reportedly the principal’s son - pleads, “Mumma, rehne do (Mom, let it be),” but no one intervenes until a woman finally steps in and asks them to stop.The video went viral on social media with some users calling for action from women's right and child welfare commissions while some praised the lady who tried to intervene.District authorities took action soon after the incident.

An Indian-origin student of the University of California, Berkeley, had her dreams shattered after she fell at least 12 feet at a fraternity house party. Doctors said Bandna Bhatti , the 21-year-old student, was paralyzed from the waist down after she slipped and fell from an external metal staircase at the Phi Kappa Tau house. Her family has been seeking help for her medical care.According to reports, after the tragic fall, Bandna remained there for 15 minutes until she was discovered by her friends who pulled her inside but the frat house allegedly told them to leave and so Bhatti was brought to a nearby apartment as her friends did not understand the extent of her injury. 911 was not called until seven hours after the fall.“Our beloved sister, Bandna, only 21 years old, was just three weeks away from graduating from UC Berkeley with a degree in Data Science — a milestone she had worked so hard for — when our world was turned upside down,” her sister Sonya Bhatti wrote in a GoFundMe page created to raise money for the college senior’s medical care.Apart from paralyzing spinal fracture, Bhatti also sustained tearing of the dura with spinal fluid leakage, a scapular fracture, and a brain hematoma.Police are looking into the incident but have not revealed any details of the investigation.The university issued a statement and offered support to Bhatti. “UC Berkeley is aware of an ongoing police investigation regarding reports of a student being injured near or at a fraternity,” UC Berkeley said in a statement to PEOPLE. “Our thoughts are with the student, their family, loved ones and friends during this time. We are following our protocols to offer support to the student and their family.”“Bandna is a brilliant, compassionate, and resilient young woman who has worked tirelessly toward her dreams. Now, she faces a long and difficult road ahead,” the GoFundMe reads.",Indian-origin student bandna bhatti was left paralyzed after a tragic fall weeks before her graduation from uc berkeley.

Past criminal record of Mahendra Patel







After spending 49 days at the Cobb County Jail in Georgia, Indian-origin engineer Mahendra Patel was granted a $10,000 bond on Tuesday in the high-profile Walmart 'attempt to kidnap' case in which Patel was 'wrongly' arrested and incarcerated.On March 18, Mahendra Patel went to the Cobb County Walmart looking for Tylenol medicine for his mother. He asked a woman, Caroline Miller, for help. Miller was on a motorized cart with her two children. When Miller showed him the direction where he would find his medicine, Patel grabbed her two-year-old son in an attempt to kidnap him; Miller accused. But Patel said he was just making sure that the child did not fall. Patel was arrested after Miller lodged a complaint and was behind bars, but his attorney recently released surveillance footage showing that there was no force, no tug-of-war between them over the kid.The prosecution on Tuesday opposed to Patel's release citing his previous arrests for fraud and DUI. “To clarify, the defendant is not entitled to bond as a matter of right. It is entirely at the court’s discretion whether to grant bond,” assistant district attorney Jason Evans said. “However, the court is not required to grant it, and the defendant’s bond status was initially set at ‘no bond” by a magistrate judge based on the sufficiency of the evidence at the warrant stage.” The prosecution argued that Patel was previously convicted of conspiracy to defraud the US and served federal prison time, apart from being charged for reckless driving.Judge Murphy ruled that Patel would be granted bond and he was not a flight risk or a danger to the community. He also did not have history of sexual assault, the judge added and referred to the surveillance footage that he did not flee Walmart and was not running away.As part of the bond conditions, Patel is not allowed to use drugs or alcohol and cannot contact the alleged victim or her family, or visit Walmart.","Mahendra patel, an indian-origin engineer, has been granted bail in a high-profile 'attempt to kidnap' case in georgia.
