KOLKATA: Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) leader and actor Mithun Chakraborty has strongly responded to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee 's remarks regarding the Maha Kumbh and said that her statements are inaccurate as 70 crore people attended and took a holy dip at the Triveni Sangam that proves the immense influence of Sanatana Dharma .""What she is saying is wrong. 70 crore people have come here and took a holy dip, is that incorrect?... People have seen the power of Sanatan Dharam,"" Mithun said.Meanwhile, Mamata Banerjee had earlier stated on Tuesday that the claim of Maha Kumbh occurring after 144 years was untrue.""After 144 years, Mahakumbh will come. This is not right. If I'm wrong, correct me. As per my knowledge, the punya snan (holy dip) system comes every year. Actually, we organise the Gangasagar Mela. That's why I know about the holy dip,"" she added.Earlier, CM Mamata Banerjee said that she respects the Maha Kumbh, but it is the ""Mrityu Kumbh"" today.This is 'Mrityu Kumbh'. I respect Mahakumbh, I respect the holy Ganga Maa. But there is no planning. How many people have been recovered?"" she said.On Tuesday, the West Bengal CM clarified her remarks on Maha Kumbh and said that she was talking about the preparations for the grand event. She said that people would suffer if there was no planning.Banerjee further demanded that the Uttar Pradesh government, led by Yogi Adityanath, should compensate the families of those who died in the Maha Kumbh stampede.""I never said about pilgrims who took a holy dip in Mahakumbh, I respect them. I'm talking about the system and preparation there. If there is no planning, people will suffer. I appeal to the Yogi government to give compensation to those who died in the Mahakumbh 2025 stampede,"" she said.",Mithun chakraborty has strongly responded to west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee's remarks regarding the maha kumbh.

Spirit Shines Through

Crucible Of Chaos

Moment Of Communion

Such A Long Journey

As a photojournalist, crowds fascinate me. And here I was, a speck in the middle of Maha Kumbh Mela, the largest gathering of humanity on Earth. Overwhelming, chaotic, and yet profoundly moving, this was an event unlike any other.For three days, I was immersed in a sea of millions, witnessing from close the fervour and devotion that drew people from every corner of this vast country to the banks of Triveni Sangam .My days would begin well before the first light of dawn, with a gruelling 20km trek to the riverbank. The sheer density of the crowd made walking a challenge. Jostled and pushed at every step, I kept going nevertheless, my eyes on the reward of this unique spiritual and cultural journey.What struck me was the determination and faith that drove the pilgrims’ progress. There were families that had walked for days, wideeyed children clinging to their parents, and elderly people perched on younger shoulders — all driven by the sacred calling of the river.In the midst of this human tide, I couldn’t help but notice the stark realities of a pilgrimage of this scale, especially for the underprivileged.Thousands slept in the open, huddling for warmth on chill-laden nights. Families cooked and ate by the roadside as droves of new arrivals filed past. The aroma of food and incense hung in the air, creating a quaint sensory symphony with the constant hum of chanting and prayers.Amid chaos and the daily struggles of ordinary pilgrims, there were moments of kindness and em pathy — strangers becoming friends and sharing whatever little they had with one another, children passing from hand to hand, and the elderly getting help from whoever they approached.With each passing day, the crowds seemed to grow thicker and almost impossible to manage. After being in several stampede-like situations in my short time there, I feared an accident was waiting to happen. And then a stampede unravelled right before my eyes. I was lucky to have enough time to escape being caught in the crush of panicky feet by climbing onto a mini-van.From the relative safety of my perch, I saw scores of children and women freeze as people around them desperately sought space that didn’t exist. The agony on their faces made me get down and somehow help carry 29 children to safety, as their mothers clung to the sides of the van.The sight of people screaming and crying as they tried to find their loved ones will forever haunt me. As the night wore on, I would learn that the stampede had claimed many lives. Siren-blaring ambulances carrying away the dead and the injured were a constant reminder of the tragedy. I felt helpless, unable to do anything but capture glimpses of the horror and pain through my lens.The next day, I stood on a roof, waiting for the sadhus to take a dip in the holy confluence. Then the news came that they had cancelled their plans due to the stampede the previous night. I was disappointed.As I prepared to leave, there was another announcement that the sadhus would arrive at 1pm. That didn’t happen either. I went back to the tent to pack my bags and leave by around 2.40pm. A third announcement confirmed that sadhus and the mela administration had decided to proceed with the ritual.I again ran 10km to the riverbank, my heart pounding with excitement. As I reached the water’s edge, I saw the most incredible sight — thousands of sadhus, their bodies painted in ash and vermilion, wading into the sacred waters to be in communion with their spirituality.Exhausted as I was by the end, all the tiredness vanished at the thought of having captured what I believed was a photo story for the ages.The journey back home was, however, fraught with challenges that would again test my patience and resolve. The roads were jammed, and we were stuck in traffic for hours. We took detours through villages, where the roads were narrow and winding.When we finally reached the main road, we were diverted again, adding hours to our journey. I missed my flight and had to wait another day to head home.In a way, the assignment ended just as it had started. Within minutes of reaching the media centre in Prayagraj on the day of our arrival, our belongings had been stolen from the car. This happened in the five-minute window that we were away collecting our media passes. I lost my clothes and two bags containing documents and hard disks were gone. For three days, I had to make do with a jacket and a blanket shared by a colleague.As I look back on the trip, the overriding feeling is of fulfilment. The experience was not just a story captured through my lens, but a life lesson in perseverance and the shared essence of our individual journeys. It’s a story I will carry with me.","Photojournalist sl shanth kumar of toi captures the essence of maha kumbh mela.

"AAP’s liquor policy caused Rs 2,000cr loss to government: CAG",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aaps-liquor-policy-caused-rs-2000cr-loss-to-government-cag/articleshow/118569185.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi government suffered a revenue loss of more than Rs 2,000 crore in implementing the contentious Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22, the Comptroller and Auditor General ( CAG ) revealed in a report that was tabled in Delhi assembly on Tuesday. The policy was withdrawn after nine months following registration of a case by CBI in July 2022 to probe alleged irregularities in its formulation and implementation.The federal auditor highlighted that the recommendations of an expert committee — formed by govt to identify lacunae in the previous excise policy and suggest changes for the formation of a new excise policy — were ignored without any justification. The new policy had inherent design issues which increased the risk of monopolisation and cartel formation.The CBI case and a related probe by ED into alleged charges of money laundering snowballed into a major political slugfest between BJP and AAP govt in Delhi. The investigating agencies arrested several people in the case, including the then chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal , his deputy, Manish Sisodia , and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh . All three are currently out on bail.CAG evaluated Delhi govt's regulation and supply of liquor in the capital from 2017-18 to 2020-21 financial years. The report was reportedly sent to the LG and Delhi govt nearly 10 months ago but was not tabled in the assembly. Newly elected CM Rekha Gupta tabled the report, which is said to be one of 14 pending with Delhi govt, on Tuesday.According to CAG, Delhi excise department claimed a loss of revenue to the tune of Rs 941.53 crore, saying timely permissions were not taken for opening liquor vends in non-conforming municipal wards while Rs 890.15 crore was lost on account of licence fee after 19 zonal licensees surrendered their permits much before the policy was withdrawn but re-tendering could not be done. It added that there was a loss of Rs 144 crore due to the “irregular grant of waiver” to licensees because of Covid-related restrictions and closure of shops for a month from Dec 28, 2021, to Jan 27, 2022, while Rs 27 crore was the shortfall of the security deposit collected from zonal licensees.The report states that Master Plan Delhi-2021 prohibited the opening of liquor vends in non-conforming areas but Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22 mandated opening at least two retail vends in each ward. “The excise department did not take timely action to work out modalities for the proposed vends in non-conforming areas and the initial tender was floated on June 28, 2021, without taking comments from DDA and MCD,” it said.“Audit noted that due to a number of issues ranging from a weak policy framework to deficient implementation of the policy...there was a cumulative loss of approximately 2,002.68 crore,” said CAG.The report said that a group of ministers (GoM), headed by the then deputy CM and excise minister Manish Sisodia, changed several recommendations of the expert committee formed to formulate the policy and allowed private parties to handle wholesale liquor operations, introduced one-time bidding instead of a lottery system to allocate vends and let licensees have 54 vends against the recommended two per entity. It added that certain decisions with revenue implications — relaxation of the coercive action mandated against defaulter licensees, waiver in license fee, refund of earnest money deposit in case of the airport zone and correction in formulae to calculate maximum retail price of foreign liquor — were taken without having mandatory approval of the cabinet and opinion of the lieutenant governor.The auditor pointed out that the policy led to the risks of monopolies and brand pushing by allowing an “exclusive arrangement” between a few wholesalers and manufacturers and letting the distributors dominate the liquor supply chain. According to the report, just three distributors controlled over 71% of the total liquor supply chain in the capital and virtually decided which brand would succeed or fail.The report mentioned that of 367 registered Indian Made Foreign Liquor brands, 25 accounted for nearly 70% of total liquor sales in Delhi and very few popular ones formed the bulk of sales volume, thus pointing towards formation of a cartel.“The policy mandated an exclusive arrangement between a manufacturer and wholesalers, which led to the entire supply of all brands of a particular manufacturer being controlled by only one wholesaler. This becomes particularly relevant considering the fact that 367 IMFL brands were registered in Delhi,” the report mentioned.This, the CAG mentioned, led to limiting the number of total licensees and increasing the risk of monopolisation and cartel formation. Under the new excise policy, wholesale licences for the supply of IMFL and FL were granted to 14 business entities, whereas the same were granted to 77 manufacturers of IMFL and 24 suppliers of FL in the old policy (2020-21).“Similarly, for the purpose of retail vends, Delhi was divided into 32 zones (containing 849 vends) whose licences were granted to 22 entities through tendering whereas 377 retail vends were run by four govt corporations and 262 retail vends were allotted to private individuals previously,"" the report said.It added that the GoM had mentioned in its report that the entire liquor retail market under the old excise regime was controlled by a few big players through a fraudulent proxy model, but the new policy – instead of removing this anomaly – recommended distribution of retail licences in zones where one entity or person could get up to 54 vends (in two zones, the maximum one could be allotted).According to the report, the licensees were required to set up laboratories before they were granted the licence but the excise department issued the related guidelines only a week before the new policy was rolled out. “The essential pre-condition to set up laboratories to ensure quality of liquor supplied was not enforced by the excise department due to delay in issuing guidelines. The licensees were allowed an extension of two months initially for setting up of the laboratory though there was no provision for this in the policy. A further extension till March 31, 2022, was granted due to the Covid pandemic. Even after this extension, they were set up only in 19 out of 62 warehouses. Batch testing was not even started in these labs,” said the report.CAG said the department was supposed to constitute special teams to pick up samples from bonded warehouses, retail vends, hotels, clubs and restaurants across all brands and publish reports of the same on the website. No reply was provided in spite of multiple reminders and it could not be verified whether such special teams were ever constituted, it stated.“Several fundamental changes were effected in the excise policy for 2021-22 relating to the levy and collection of excise duty, administration of the liquor supply chain and coverage of retail operations. The actual policy contained provisions which were at variance with the underlying objectives for change in policy and the expert committee report,” the CAG report mentioned.“Responsibility and accountability should be fixed for the lapses observed and the enforcement mechanism should be strengthened,” it concluded.","Delhi government suffered a revenue loss of more than rs 2,000 crore in implementing the contentious delhi excise policy 2021-22.

Sajjan Kumar gets two life terms for 2 murders during 1984 riots,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sajjan-gets-two-life-terms-for-2-murders-during-1984-riots/articleshow/118568629.cms,"File photo of Sajjan Kumar (Pic credit: PTI)

Testimonies of victims’ kin nailed Sajjan

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court Tuesday awarded two life terms to Congress ex-MP Sajjan Kumar (80) for murdering a Sikh man and his son during the anti-Sikh riots in Nov 1984. The court said the offences committed were ""undoubtedly brutal and reprehensible"".The two life terms - one for the double murders and another for offences under Section 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc.) of the IPC - will run concurrently.The court had on Feb 12 convicted Kumar in the case for killing Jaswant Singh and son Tarundeep Singh in Saraswati Vihar.Refusing to consider the case in the ""rarest of rare"" category to be fit for awarding death sentence, special judge Kaveri Baweja cited several ""mitigating factors"", including Kumar's age, his health condition and his bedridden wife. ""The satisfactory conduct of the convict as per report of jail authorities... the fact he has roots in society and the possibility of his reformation and rehabilitation are material considerations which, in my opinion, tilt the scales in favour of a sentence for life imprisonment,"" Baweja said.Kumar is already serving a life term in a case related to the anti-Sikh riots awarded by Delhi High Court in 2018. The court had specified in that case that he will remain in jail for the rest of his life.Senior advocate HS Phoolka, who appeared on behalf of the complainant in the case, explained the two life sentences awarded by the court. ""One has been awarded for murder under Section 302 of IPC and the other for offences under 436 IPC. The minimum prescribed sentence for murder and the maximum sentence for offences under 436 IPC have been awarded. Both sentences will run concurrently, but two life sentences will have a serious bearing on any plea by Kumar for bail. Getting bail will be difficult,"" said Phoolka.The court pointed out that the incident in question can said to be a part of the same chain of incidents for which Kumar was sentenced to life imprisonment by Delhi High Court on December 12, 2018. He had been found guilty of causing the death of five innocent persons during a similar incident of rioting following the assassination of Indira Gandhi.""Though the killing of two innocent persons in the present case is no less an offence...the above noted circumstances, in my opinion, do not make this a 'rarest of rare case' warranting imposition of the death penalty for the offence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 149 IPC,"" the court observed.Outlining the brutality suffered by the victims, the court said it has been established that the victims in the present case witnessed not only the brutal killing of their family members at the hands of the rioting mob, which Kumar was a part of, but also the burning and destruction of their house and looting of their belongings.""The helplessness of the victims and the lack of any support whatsoever from the neighbours and also the police have been established from their uncontroverted depositions. In these circumstances, I am of the considered opinion that this is a fit case where the convict must also be awarded life imprisonment for the offence punishable under Section 436 IPC r/w Section 149 IPC in addition to a fine,"" said the court.The court listed various aggravating factors in the case, including the murder of two innocent persons by burning them in the presence of their family members, inflicting injuries and the resultant continuing trauma of the survivor victims (wife, daughter, and niece of deceased victim Jaswant Singh) and destruction of their house and belongings by the mob, of which Kumar was a member during rioting, targeting of male members of a particular community and Kumar's conviction in a similar case by Delhi HC where five persons were murdered by a mob of which Kumar was held to be the leader.However, the court's inclination went in favour of the mitigating circumstances while sentencing Kumar.The court called the testimonies of the witnesses - the complainant wife, daughter and niece of deceased Jaswant Singh ""reliable"" and uncontroverted as they proved that their house at Raj Nagar in Saraswati Vihar, Delhi, was set on fire by the said mob.While sentencing Kumar, the court took note of a report of Tihar Jail authorities, which stated that on account of his prevailing health conditions, Kumar was unable to carry out his daily routine/activities properly. The report said that due to his frail health, he is also not able to do any work in jail.The report also said that he is under treatment and has been prescribed antidepressants and sleep medicines. He otherwise does not show any signs and symptoms of mental illness and does not require any psychiatric intervention at present, said the report of the jail administration.","A delhi court awarded two life terms to congress ex-mp sajjan kumar (80) for murdering a sikh man and his son during the anti-sikh riots in nov 1984.

Now, as Maha Kumbh draws to a close after Wednesday's Maha Shivratri snan , the sacred hum of prayers will fade. The makeshift settlements along Triveni Sangam will be dismantled. The city will slowly return to its everyday rhythm.The farewell will take place at Kashi Vishwanath temple , with Naga sadhus - ascetics wrapped in ash and mystery - offering prayers on Maha Shivratri. Their journey, one that began in the confluence of Sangam, will culminate in Varanasi, the timeless city where Shiva himself is believed to reside. ""We will bow before Kashi Vishwanath in all its splendour,"" said Mahant Prem Giri, president of Juna Akhara, overseeing the final preparations. With chariots mounted on tractor trolleys and the air thick with chants of ""Har Har Mahadev"", the Shaiv Akharas will part ways.Some will remain in Varanasi to oversee internal matters and prepare for upcoming akhara elections, while the rest will disperse to distant hermitages, awaiting their next great gathering in Trimbakeshwar for the Nasik Kumbh in 2027. The next Prayagraj Maha Kumbh lies far ahead, in 2031 - a date marked in the unseen folds of time.For Prayagraj, Maha Kumbh was more than just a religious event - it was a transformation.

"In rare surgery, docs separate ‘parasitic twin’ from 17-year-old",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-rare-surgery-docs-separate-parasitic-twin-from-17-year-old/articleshow/118568388.cms,"Freed from ‘parasitic twin’, boy makes quick recovery

NEW DELHI: In a rare surgical procedure, doctors at AIIMS successfully conducted a procedure to separate a ‘parasitic twin’ weighing 15 kg from a 17-year-old boy hailing from UP’s Unnao district. The occurrence of conjoined twins is notably uncommon, with frequencies of 1 in 50,000 to 100,000 births. In certain instances, incomplete development results in asymmetrical or ‘parasitic twins’, where one twin (autosite) develops fully while the other (parasite) remains dependent. Such cases are exceedingly rare, with only 40 documented instances in world medical literature.Dr Asuri Krishna, additional professor in the surgery department, noted that when the boy visited AIIMS OPD on Jan 28, they initially mistook his covered abdomen for a carried child. Instead, they discovered two fully developed lower limbs with external genitalia attached to his abdomen.Since birth, the boy lived with these additional limbs from his underdeveloped twin. The parasitic appendage, including underdeveloped male genitalia, grew proportionally with him. The boy experienced sensations, including touch, pain and temperature in the parasitic limb. Despite occasional abdominal discomfort, he maintained normal bodily functions without major health complications.His condition led to considerable social isolation and emotional difficulties throughout childhood. Local medical practitioners advised against removal, warning of potential fatality due to shared cardiac connections. These circumstances forced him to discontinue his education after 8 years of age. His physical limitations included the inability to sleep on his abdomen.The parasitic structure received nutrition through blood supply from the host twin. Medical experts noted that as patients age, such parasitic growths can potentially cause cardiovascular complications and neurological issues, posing life-threatening risks.Following a relative's suggestion, he sought treatment at AIIMS as a last hope. Upon arrival, a multidisciplinary team, including surgeons, radiologists and anaesthesiologists evaluated his condition.AIIMS specialists noted that whilst prenatal screening can detect this condition, the patient's socio-economic background prevented early diagnosis.CT angiography revealed the parasitic limb's blood supply originated from an internal mammary artery branch. The scan also identified a substantial abdominal cystic mass. After comprehensive preparation, surgery was scheduled for February 8, 2025.The complex procedure involved two phases: removing the parasitic limb through careful dissection and vessel ligation, followed by excision of the abdominal cystic mass.Surgeons discovered and removed underdeveloped testes within the attachment site tissue. The second phase required careful separation of the cystic mass from surrounding organs. They noted an unusually high bladder extension, which required precise surgical management. Post-procedure drainage and suturing completed the operation. The operation lasted between 2 and 2.5 hours.Doctors said that the patient was free from additional health complications. Recovery was swift, with successful oral feeding resuming the next day. The medical team removed the drain on the third day, and the patient was cleared to go home on the fourth day.After 17 years of physical and emotional challenges, the successful surgery brought immense relief. Initially experiencing phantom sensations, the patient could finally anticipate a conventional lifestyle.The achievement resulted from collaborative efforts of numerous specialists, including Dr Asuri Krishna, Dr VK Bansal, Dr Sushant Soren, Dr Brijesh Kumar Singh, Dr Abhinav Kumar, Dr Jaymeen Makwana from Surgical Disciplines, Dr Manish Singhal and Dr Sashank from plastic surgery, Dr Ganga Prasad and Dr Rakesh from anaesthesia, and Dr Atin and Dr Ankita from radiology.","Freed from ‘parasitic twin’, boy makes quick recovery.

Chatterjee, a resident of Chandernagore in Bengal, was traveling to Gaya in Bihar for work when the accident occurred around 12.30am. While Chatterjee, seated in the front passenger seat, bled to death, at least two of her colleagues suffered injuries. Police have seized both vehicles involved in the chase, but have yet to make any arrests.Durgapur-Asansol police commissioner Sunil Kumar Choudhary said the crash resulted from an overtaking attempt gone wrong.

They alleged that the occupants of the white car had been harassing Chatterjee before ramming their vehicle multiple times over a 10km stretch.""There were five men in the car. They constantly honked and made obscene gestures at madam while driving next to our car. They kept overtaking us and then allowing us to go ahead.

She took care of her ailing mother and two grandmothers while managing her newly launched event management company Moonwalk, based in Gaya.Her grieving mother Tanushree rejected the police version of events and demanded immediate arrests.""I lost my husband eight months ago, and now my only child.

They directed MMRDA ""to take a fresh decision with regard to either discontinuation or otherwise of the contract awarded to the petitioner afresh after hearing it, by way of a speaking order (with reasons).""The petition was filed by Systra MVA Consulting (India) Pvt Ltd, which challenged the validity of the Jan 3 notice to discontinue its services for metro lines 5 (Thane-Bhiwandi-Kalyan), 7A ( Andheri (E)-international airport), and 9 (Dahisar-Mira-Bhayandar).Senior advocate Venkatesh Dhond argued that the notice was issued outside the terms of the agreement and doesn't set out the reasons for the discontinuation of Systra MVA's services.Senior advocate Birendra Saraf , for the MMRDA, said the petition is ""misconceived"" and proceeds on an erroneous basis that the notice of discontinuance is outside the contract. He said a clause in the general conditions of the contract enables it to terminate the contract without assigning any reasons.In Feb 2020, the MMRDA invited bids for the appointment of a general consultant for design, assistance in procurement, construction, and management supervision of Mumbai Metro lines 5 (Thane-Bhiwandi-Kalyan), 7A (Andheri (E)-CSIA), and 9 (Dahisar-Mira-Bhayandar). The Systra-SMCIPL consortium, of which Systra MVA is a part and has a 70% stake, submitted its Rs 90.7 crore bid.The MMRDA accepted the bid. On May 31, 2021, it issued a letter of acceptance (LOA) to the petitioner and appointed it as the general consultant for system works ""for a part of the corridor of"" the three Metro lines.

He said a clause in the general conditions of the contract enables it to terminate the contract without assigning any reasons.In Feb 2020, the MMRDA invited bids for the appointment of a general consultant for design, assistance in procurement, construction, and management supervision of Mumbai Metro lines 5 (Thane-Bhiwandi-Kalyan), 7A (Andheri (E)-CSIA), and 9 (Dahisar-Mira-Bhayandar).

NEW DELHI: Government has set a target to construct 10,000 km of national highways (NHs) in 2025-26, as per the budget document, which is the lowest in the past seven years since 2018-19. However, continuing with the sharper focus on building wider and greenfield highways and expressways, the road transport and highways ministry has set a target for all high speed corridors to touch 5,800 km in the next one year.The ministry uploaded the detailed budget document on Monday.The details of highway construction since 2018-19 shows that the lowest was at 10,237 km in 2019-20 and the highest was 13,327 km in 2020-21 despite the impact of Covid-19 pandemic. During the last financial year, the overall NH construction stood at 12,349 km. Officials said that by March this year, the ministry is hopeful of achieving around 10,500 km.By mid-February, all agencies constructed around 8,000 km of NHs. Sources said though the target for FY26 may be revised at a later stage, the pace will remain less since now there are less number of highway projects that are under implementation. Slow pace of award of new projects in 2023-24 and the current financial year will impact the construction in the next two financial years.As per the detailed budget document, the ministry has set the target to raise around Rs 30,000 crore from monetisation of completed highway projects and getting around Rs 35,000 crore private investment.The govt has also earmarked Rs 128 crore for the implementation of cashless treatment to road crash victims across all states and UTs. At present, the scheme has been rolled out in Assam, Chandigarh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Haryana and Puducherry.

Three-language policy, delimitation

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai fired back at chief minister MK Stalin after the chief minister announced that the state was ready for ""another language war"". Stalin called an all-party meeting on March 5 to discuss the Lok Sabha delimitation issue -- the ""threat"" that Tamil Nau was going to lose eight seats because the state successfully implemented the family planning programme leading to population control.Annamalai said the BJP may not attend the all-party meeting as he believes Stalin was now trying to ""shift the narrative"" with the ""imaginary fear"" regarding delimitation. ""When TN CM Thiru MK Stalin knows the whole of TN has rejected their argument except a few paint-dabba carrying DMK cadres on the third language for our children studying in TN Govt schools similar to the schools run by TN CM’s family, he now wants to shift the narrative to his imaginary fear of TN losing in the Delimitation of seats,"" Annamalai posted on X.""What a shame & downfall for DMK!"" he said.""When our Hon PM Thiru @narendramodi avl had clearly said delimitation - if and when it happens - will be favourable to all, including the southern states, why this fear-mongering Thiru @mkstalin? Imaginary fears & stupid arguments have, of late, become TN CM’s arsenal!"" Annamalai wrote.When Stalin was asked if the March 5 meeting would discuss the three-language policy in light of the National Education Policy, Stalin said that to raise a voice in Parliament on these issues, adequate number of MPs was required. ""Because, in the name of delimitation, a sword is hanging over southern states,"" he said.""Tamil Nadu succeeded in population control through the family planning programme. Just because population is less, there is a situation of the Lok Sabha seats being cut down (in TN). We stand to lose 8 seats and as a result, we would be having only 31 MPs, and not the 39 (present number),"" he added.""Our representation (in Parliament) will reduce, Tamil Nadu's voice is being stifled. This is a matter of Tamil Nadu's rights. All leaders and political parties should jointly speak across party lines on the issue,"" the CM added.DMK has been opposing the three-language policy and insisted that the state would continue with Tamil and English resisting the push for Hindi from the BJP-led NDA government.On the issue question of Hindi imposition, Stalin said Tamil Nadu is ready for another language war if necessary -- in reference to the anti-Hindi agitation of 1965.","Annamalai said tamil nadu chief minister mk stalin was instilling imaginery fears among people.

Three out of five in India succumb to cancer after diagnosis: ICMR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/three-out-of-five-in-india-succumb-to-cancer-after-diagnosis-icmr/articleshow/118567092.cms,"NEW DELHI: Nearly three out of five people in India succumb following cancer diagnosis, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has claimed. The apex health research agency's claim is based on an analysis of the estimates of incidence and mortality of cancer from GLOBOCAN 2022 - an online database that provides cancer statistics for 185 countries.India is one of the largest contributors to global cancer burden, ranking third in terms of new incidences. China ranks one in cancer incidence followed by the US.According to the ICMR study, published in the journal 'The Lancet Regional - Southeast Asia', the incident to mortality percentage in India stands at approximately 65, which means that three out of five individuals would be expected to die if diagnosed with cancer. The incident to mortality percentages in China and the US stand at 50 and 23 respectively, according to the study.Children (0-14) and reproductive-age (15-49) individuals, ICMR says, have a 0.1%-2.3% chance of developing cancer and a 0.08%-1.3% chance of dying from it. However, the study adds, middle-aged and geriatric individuals have a higher 8.3%-10.3% chance of developing cancer with a 5.5%-7.6% chance of dying from the disease.Women bear a ""disproportionate burden"" with higher crude incidence (104.5 per 1,00,000 population) and crude mortality rate (64.2 per 1,00,000) compared to men (91.5 per 1,00,000 and 62.2 per 1,00,000), according to the study, which also says that trend analysis for past mortality patterns indicate cancer mortality rates in India are on the rise for last two decades.Future projections show that cancer incidence and mortality will continue to rise in the coming years, with mortality rates expected to increase from 64.7 to 109.6 between 2022 and 2050, it says.ICMR warns India is poised to face formidable challenge in cancer control in coming years due to the transition of the current reproductive-age population (15-49 years) to middle-aged (50-69) and geriatric (70+) groups. It has called for proactive measures to enhance early detection, access to quality care, and public health initiatives.Chairperson of Max Institute of Cancer Care, Dr Harit Chaturvedi, said fight against cancer must be multi-pronged. ""We need to create awareness on avoiding unhealthy eating and sedentary lifestyles that are linked to development of several non-communicable diseases, including cancers,"" he said. He added that diagnostic facilities and treatment for cancer need to be made accessible and affordable for early detection and improved outcome.Realising the challenge posed by the rising incidence and mortality caused by the disease, govt in the Union budget 2025-26 said it is planning to have daycare cancer centres in all 759 districts of the country where chemotherapy, essential medication and biopsy services will be made available. Top health ministry officials said these centres will also be utilised for screening high-risk individuals for common cancers.","India is one of the largest contributors to global cancer burden, ranking third in terms of new incidences.

NEW DELHI/AMRITSAR: A batch of 12 illegal Indian immigrants deported from the US to Panama arrived Sunday in Delhi via Istanbul on a Turkish Airlines flight, making them the first group to be sent back without restraints since three American military aircraft brought 332 deportees to Amritsar within a fortnight this month.The 12 deportees are said to be among 50 undocumented Indian nationals who reportedly arrived in Panama recently. Panama has been assisting the US in its deportation efforts.According to local media reports, the UN-affiliated International Organisation for Migration helped purchase plane tickets for people of various nationalities whose citizenship was confirmed, 17 of them Indians. More deportees from the group are expected next week once MEA verifies their nationality.Deportation from Panama is being carried out under the Regional Assisted Voluntary Return Programme , an IOM protection and support response to facilitate the dignified, safe, regular and orderly return, as well as voluntary and based on an informed decision, of migrants to their countries of origin.Four men from Punjab in the latest batch took a connecting IndiGo flight from Delhi to Amritsar.Airport authorities in the city were informed in advance about the arrival of Patiala resident Jatinder Singh, Maninder Dutt of Jalandhar, and Jugraj Singh and Harpreet Singh from Gurdaspur, but it wasn't immediately clear whether they came unescorted all the way from Panama.Official sources said after the mandatory debriefing that Jatinder, 34, paid a travel agent from Patiala Rs 52 lakh to help him enter the US through a route criss-crossing Guyana, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico.Maninder, 21, put his faith and Rs 42 lakh in the hands of a Delhi-based illegal immigration agent, who then sent him on a perilous journey through Spain, Salvador, Guatemala, and Mexico. Jugraj and Harpreet, both 30, paid Rs 38 lakh each to an agent from Batala and reached the US via Nicaragua.Punjab NRI minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal said the state govt had registered cases against 15 travel agents based on complaints from natives of the state who were deported from the US this month. Of these, three agents have been arrested, while police have been raiding offices and homes in search of the absconding 12.Sources said the deportees who arrived on Sunday told authorities they intended to file cases against the travel agents who duped them only if there was a chance of getting their money back.The first US military flight that arrived on Feb 5 brought 104 deportees, with both men and women handcuffed and their feet shackled. The second flight, carrying 119 deportees, arrived on Feb 15. The third flight, with 112 deportees, landed on Feb 16, this time with only the men in shackles.",Four men from punjab in the latest batch took a connecting indigo flight from delhi to amritsar.

Until Monday, the rescue teams could not reach the last point and were stuck 40 meters away.Hoping against hope, the teams utilised thermocol boats to navigate the challenging terrain to bring out at least some of the workers alive but the chances of them coming out of the tunnel looked dim.If not, the teams will at least try to salvage the workers' bodies and bring them out of the tunnel, officials at the site said. As of now, the teams are still facing obstacles, with heavy water and slush hampering the rescue efforts.The eight workers, who are believed to be trapped in the last 50 meters in front of the tunnel boring machine (TBM), remained unaccounted for since the collapse of the tunnel roof on Feb 22.The project contracting agency, Jaiprakash Associates Ltd , initiated dewatering operations to clear the water from the site in the hope of finding the survivors. Officials remain cautiously optimistic that some of the workers might still be alive, though they acknowledge that they are racing against time.Telangana irrigation minister N Uttam Kumar Reddy, who was at the site, instructed the NDRF, Navy, and other agencies to work in coordination and clear the final stretch of the tunnel. ""The goal is to push the mud towards the tunnel entrance in order to locate the missing workers,"" he said and directed Jaiprakash Associates to dewater the entire tunnel by Tuesday night or Wednesday morning.","The national disaster response force (ndrf) teams on tuesday finally reached the last point of the collapsed roof, where the eight workers were trapped since feb 22 morning.

"Engineering faculty to now 'intern' in factories, labs & boardrooms",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/engineering-faculty-to-now-intern-in-factories-labs-boardrooms/articleshow/118566994.cms,"MUMBAI: In a striking reversal of roles, campuses across India will send engineering faculty into factories, boardrooms and laboratories of the industries they prepare their students to join. For a full year, faculty will trade lectures for deadlines, syllabi for budgets, and the structured rhythms of academia for the relentless pace of the private sector. This AICTE industry internship isn't just a handshake between academia and industry; it's an immersion, designed to sharpen understanding and strengthen collaboration.Professors will navigate the same pressures as the engineers they teach-long hours, tight budgets, and unyielding expectations. To support this transition, over and above their salary, All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) will offer them an honorarium of Rs 75,000 a month while the companies hosting them will provide a monthly stipend of Rs 25,000.""This is an ambitious endeavour, a deliberate break from tradition, and it has full backing of AICTE's executive committee. We are setting the stage for 300 faculty members-young, under 45, and eager to step beyond the lecture halls to take up real-world problem-solving inside a public limited company,"" said AICTE vice-chairman Abhay Jere.Draft guidelines with minute details are being designed, but important criteria include the standing of the companies that faculty can join and the fact that faculty who can apply will be mid- and senior-level teachers. ""The fellowships will be of two kinds: 200 will work for an entire year and the remaining faculty can work for two stretches of six months each. We are experimenting with two models, to which industry and institutes can respond,"" said Jere. A selection committee of AICTE will pick faculty who apply, industry will interview them, and if they are found suitable, they will be awarded the fellowship.The scheme is rooted in a deep problem statement: On the one hand, colleges are complaining that industry is saying that students are not up to the mark. On the other, industry is claiming that faculty in our colleges are clueless about what is going on in industry and hence do not prepare students for real work-world challenges.","All india council for technical education (aicte) will offer them an honorarium of rs 75,000 a month.
