Party’s spokesperson Tuhin Sinha noted that the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, a scheme providing LPG connections to poor households, has provided 10.3 crore connections so far, with nearly nine crore beneficiaries turning out to be sustained users of the programme.“This negates opposition’s claim that many beneficiaries did not opt for refills after utilising the initial free gas cylinders,” Sinha told reporters. The scheme has led to an expansion in the LPG network with 7,959 more distributorships, overwhelmingly in the rural areas, he said, adding that the per capita consumption was 3.9 cylinders.Sinha said the beneficiaries include 1.8 crore in Uttar Pradesh, 1.2 crore in West Bengal and 1.1 crore in Bihar, adding that it shows the wide popularity of the welfare programme that also led to a drop in the country’s carbon footprint.

"27 Maoists killed carried total bounty of 12.3 cr; 25, including 12 women, were for Basavaraju’s protection",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/27-maoists-killed-carried-total-bounty-of-12-3-cr-25-including-12-women-were-for-basavarajus-protection/articleshow/121350603.cms,"Representational AI image

NEW DELHI: The 27 Naxalites killed in Wednesday’s anti-Maoist operation in Narayanpur, Chhattisgarh — including top CPI (Maoist) leader Nambala Keshava Rao alias Basavaraju — carried a total bounty of over Rs 12.3 crore, which is likely to be distributed among personnel of the District Reserve Guard (DRG) who executed the operation.Among the 27 Maoist cadres neutralised — all now identified — 15 were men and 12 women. As many as 25 were part of the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army’s (PLGA) Company No.7, the dedicated armed wing of CPI (Maoist) that handles protection of top central committee leaders like Basavaraju and former general secretary Mupalla Laxman Rao alias Ganapathy.“PLGA Company No.7 is estimated to have a total strength of 60. Of these, 25 were in Basavaraju’s security detail. All the 25, including 12 women cadres, one of whom was deputy commander of Company No.7, were neutralised on Wednesday,” a top intelligence officer told TOI.The large women’s component in PLGA units is not unusual. Among the 31 Maoists killed in the operation at Karregutta Hills on the Chhattisgarh-Telangana border, 16 were women, most of them part of CPI (Maoist)’s most lethal armed wing, the PLGA Battalion No.1. The women guerrillas go through the same rigorous training as their male counterparts, their tough bodies and steely resolve easing their transition into brutal sharp-shooters.There was one important casualty in the Narayanpur operation other than Basavaraju. Jangu Naveen alias Madhu, a senior leader of the Dandkaranya Zone Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC), who was likely heading the CPI (Maoist) central committee secretariat, was with Basavaraju when they were challenged by DRG personnel. Hailing from Prakasam district of Andhra Pradesh, Naveen, 45, was secretary to central committee and central regional bureau (CRB).While Basavaraju carried a total reward of Rs 10 crore, announced by NIA and various state govts, Jangu Naveen had a bounty of Rs 25 lakh. A Rs 10 lakh reward each was declared against four other senior cadres — Sangeeta, Bhoomika, Company No.7 commander Roshan and his deputy Somli. All four were Company Party Company (CYPC) members.The remaining 21 members — all from PLGA Company No.7 — carried a reward of Rs 8 lakh each, with their total bounty adding up to Rs 1.7 crore.“Since this was exclusively a DRG operation, the bounties declared on the 27 killed Maoists will be split among the DRG personnel who were part of it. This will follow the due process, which includes a magisterial inquiry. Since the operation was in Chhattisgarh, the state DGP may write to the other state govts to give the rewards declared by them, to the DRG personnel,” Bastar IG P Sundarraj told TOI.The age profile of the 26 Maoists killed with Basavaraju show that 15 of them were less than 25 years old, with the youngest being a woman barely 20 years of age.Only five of the 26 Maoists eliminated in Narayanpur hailed from Andhra Pradesh or Telangana; the rest were all from Chhattisgarh, hailing from Bijapur, Sukma, Indravati, West Bastar, South Bastar and Narayanpur.","The 27 naxalites killed in wednesday’s anti-maoist operation in narayanpur, chhattisgarh carried a total bounty of over rs 12.3 crore.

NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday filed the chargesheet against former Jammu and Kashmir governor Satya Pal Malik and five others in connection with the Kiru hydropower corruption case, PTI reported quoting officials.In 2024, the CBI had carried out searches at eight locations across Delhi and Jammu as part of a probe into alleged corruption involving the awarding of civil contracts worth Rs 2,200 crore for the Kiru Hydro Electric Power Project.The investigation stems from a request made by the Jammu and Kashmir government in 2022, seeking a CBI inquiry into suspected irregularities in the awarding of two major contracts. These concerns were initially raised by Satya Pal Malik, who served as the governor of J&K from August 23, 2018, to October 30, 2019. Malik had publicly alleged that he was offered a Rs 300 crore bribe to approve two files, one of which related to the Kiru project.After a CBI search at his residence last year, he denied all corruption allegations. Malik stated that instead of investigating those he accused of corruption, the agency targeted him. “They will not get anything except 4-5 kurtas and pyjamas. The dictator is trying to scare me by misusing government agencies.I am a farmer's son, I will neither be afraid nor bow down,” he posted online.The CBI has booked Navin Kumar Choudhary, then chairman of Chenab Valley Power Projects Private Limited (CVPPPL), along with officials M S Babu, M K Mittal, and Arun Kumar Mishra, and Patel Engineering Limited.

Poll What is more important when managing religious endowment boards? Ensuring minority community representation Maintaining secular management of properties

After countering the Muslim side's argument that non-Muslims could theoretically form a majority in the Central Waqf Council and Auqaf Boards, Centre told Supreme Court Wednesday that an ill-founded attempt was made to project discrimination of Muslims by comparing composition of waqf bodies with religious endowment boards of Hindus, Sikhs and Christians.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta exhibited documents, including the minority affairs ministry's written assurance to the Joint Parliamentary Committee and its affidavit in SC, to apprise a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih that the council and boards would never lose their minority character as an overwhelming majority of members would always be Muslims.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal had taken nearly 30 minutes on Tuesday to highlight apprehension among Muslims about the council and boards losing their minority character by claiming that the govt, through the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025, at least theoretically intended to make non-Muslims the majority in these two bodies. He had asked when the govt never attempted to make non-believers in Hinduism, Sikhism and Christianity members in their religious endowment boards, why were waqfs of Muslims singled out. He termed it discrimination on the ground of religion, which violated the fundamental right to non-discrimination guaranteed under Article 15.Mehta said Hindu religious endowment board members entered temples and even supervised rituals.The charity commissioner, who can be non-Hindu, can appoint archakas (pujaris) and remove them for not performing rituals or for immoral activities, and SC had upheld this by terming appointment of archakas as a secular activity, he added.The SG said Hindu personal laws were codified in 1956, but Muslims continued to be governed by Sharia law. Adjudicating a petition highlighting this discrimination, SC in 1996 had said such a comparison was not possible and reforms in personal law and religious activities were a gradual process.""There cannot be any comparison with Hindu religious endowment boards as they deal with religion and rituals. But the boards deal with management of waqf properties, which is a secular activity, and the state has the power to regulate it through legislation. None of the petitioners has challenged Parliament's legislative competence to enact the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025,"" the SG said.He said the JPC had consulted Archaeological Survey of India on ancient monuments being taken out of the purview of waqf. ASI said while religious activities, which have been going on for years, had not been stopped in protected and ancient monuments, waqf boards managing these monuments as waqfs had unilaterally allowed commercial activities in these ancient spaces, hindering preservation and conservation works.Mehta said in certain cases, waqf boards had restrained ASI from carrying out repair and restoration work in ancient monuments.","Centre says attempt was made to project discrimination of muslims by comparing composition of waqf bodies with religious endowment boards of hindus, sikhs and christians.

He is the elder brother of Mallojula Koteshwar Rao alias Kishenji, who was eliminated in an encounter near Kolkata in 2011.Sonu is likely to lay down arms and join his wife Tarakka, who surrendered before Maharashtra police late last year and is currently staying at Gadchiroli police's rehabilitation camp. On Thursday, CM Devendra Fadnavis hinted at large-scale surrender of rebels in Gadchiroli, which sources claim is a pointer to the possible laying down of arms by an entire 'platoon' commandeered by Sonu.""Sonu is likely to be holed up in a forested hillock at Abujmarh.

The tables have turned, the guerrillas are under siege, they can no longer ambush with mines or grenades,"" said a senior police officer.Though there's speculation about Sonu or his younger comrade Thippiri Tirupati alias Devji (60) heading CPI (Maoist), intelligence agencies feel the veteran Maoist doesn't have age on his side, and is inclined for truce. Apart from the tottering leadership, security agencies pointed out that the tribal cadres in Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra are rudderless. ""There's strong resentment among lower-rung tribal cadres against Telugu domination of CC and the way they force tribals to do menial jobs or push them into the frontlines,"" said an official, adding arrogance and rigidity of Telugu leadership in CC has led to their decimation.Sources said there's a possibility of an exodus now, with tribal cadres ready to abandon the Maoist cause and return to the mainstream, rather than get neutralised.

Govt on Waqf Act in SC: Proof of being Muslim in sync with Sharia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-on-waqf-act-in-sc-proof-of-being-muslim-in-sync-with-sharia/articleshow/121348573.cms,"No mention of 'waqf by user' term in 1923 Act: Raj govt to SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its verdict on the ambit, contours and necessity of an interim order after arguments over three days between the Centre and petitioners for and against the validity of Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra. Responding to the petitioners' objection to the provision that only a practising Muslim for five years could dedicate properties for waqf, SG Tushar Mehta said it was in sync with the requirement of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937.Given the widespread misuse of waqf properties and their usurpation for personal purposes noted from 1870s, registration of waqf properties, including 'waqf by user', needed to be mandatorily registered under the 1923 and 1995 Waqf Acts, he said. Mehta said a person could be governed by the 1937 Act only if he satisfied the prescribed authority that he was a Muslim and filled a form before that authority declaring that he desired to follow Sharia law and be governed by its provisions - ranging from marriage to waqfs. ""So, what is the problem in the new law asking a person to be mandatorily a Muslim for the purpose of making a waqf?"" he asked.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, supported by A M Singhvi, Rajeev Dhavan and Huzefa Ahmadi, said the way the new waqf law was drafted, it would allow govt to take over 'waqf by user' properties, which were not registered for decades because of fault of state govts, an eventuality which would result in punishing the community for no fault of its.Sibal said waqf was part of zakat, one of the 5 cardinal principles intrinsic to Islam. ""Waqf was purely religious, and no authority could interfere in this as the Constitution guarantees that every religious denomination has the absolute right to manage its religious institutions, which in this case is waqf,"" he added.Appearing for Rajasthan, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said 'waqf by user' was a term evolved by Privy Council and did not find mention in the 1923 Waqf Act. There was no dedication to Allah in case of 'waqf by user', he said. For ST Muslim organisation, Odisha, and a waqf board, senior advocates Ranjit Kumar, Maninder Singh and Gopal Sankaranarayanan supported Centre's stand.An advocate brought to the court's notice that in Tamil Nadu's Tiruchendurai, its 1,500-year-old Chola-era temple and the surrounding area had been declared waqf property by TN waqf board. She said the board's claim was met with resistance from villagers, who were unable to sell their land without the board's approval. She said the new law would curb such practices.","No mention of 'waqf by user' term in 1923 act: raj govt to sc.

Rape charge invalid sans proof of refusal to marry: Himachal Pradesh HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rape-charge-invalid-sans-proof-of-refusal-to-marry-himachal-pradesh-hc/articleshow/121348534.cms,"SHIMLA: When two people are in a long-term bond, it is difficult to determine that their sexual relationship is based solely on a promise to marry, Himachal Pradesh HC has held. HC took the position while faulting a trial court's move to frame rape charges against a man accused of rape by his partner of five years, reports Sanjeev Verma. HC held that such charges could not be formalised as the complainant woman had failed to adduce proof of the male partner having refused to marry her, especially when both had knowingly entered into a long-term physical relationship.The bench allowed the man's appeal against the decision of the fast-track trial court in Sirmaur's Nahan. HC noted that there was not a single clear averment in the complaint by the 30-year-old woman that the man had refused to marry her.The bench noticed that according to the complainant, the marriage was agreed upon in 2014 but put off several times till 2021 when there were alleged demands of dowry from the man's family. However, the HC cited eyewitnesses' statements that the dowry demand was not made by the male partner, and, hence, there was no proof before the trial court to frame charges under the anti-dowry law.",Hc took the position while faulting a trial court's move to frame rape charges against a man accused of rape by his partner of five years.

Supreme Court classifies 'zudpi' jungles in 6 Vidarbha districts as forest land,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-classifies-zudpi-jungles-in-6-vidarbha-districts-as-forest-land/articleshow/121348533.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that 'zudpi' jungles or shrub forests in six districts in Maharashtra's Vidarbha region will be treated as forest land but said thousands of hectares of such land allotted for residential houses, agriculture, govt offices and public utilities prior to Dec 1996 would face no adverse consequence. However, the allotment of 'zudpi' jungle land for commercial purposes after Oct 25, 1980, would be treated as encroachment and removed, said a bench of CJI B R Gavai and A G Masih.Writing the judgment, CJI Gavai said exempting residential houses, govt buildings and public utilities, which got land prior to Dec 1996, from removal is a one-time exception carved out in adherence with the concept of sustainable development and economic democracy as espoused by Dr B R Ambedkar in his speech in the Constituent Assembly.SC was concerned with 'zudpi' forest land in Nagpur, Wardha, Bandara, Gondia, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli districts. CJI Gavai said the Maharashtra govt shall seek approval under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act for the deletion of such land from the 'List of Forest Areas'.However, to compensate for the loss of these shrub forest lands, the bench said that 'zudpi' land will not be permitted to be used for compensatory afforestation unless there is a certificate of the chief secretary regarding non-availability of non-forest land for the purposes of afforestation. In such cases, compensatory afforestation must be carried out on double the area of 'zudpi' jungle land. It ordered the transfer of 'zudpi' land from the state revenue department to the state forest department.SC directed constitution of a special task force in each of the six districts, comprising SDM, Dy-SP, assistant conservator of forest and taluka inspector of land revenue, to remove encroachments on 'zudpi' jungles within two years.","'zudpi' jungles or shrub forests in six districts in maharashtra's vidarbha region will be treated as forest land.

"Sonia, Rahul Gandhi denied knowing about AJL-YI transactions: ED",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sonia-rahul-gandhi-denied-knowing-about-ajl-yi-transactions-ed/articleshow/121348531.cms,"NEW DELHI: During her questioning over three days in July 2022 in the National Herald money laundering case, former Congress president Sonia Gandhi had told Enforcement Directorate (ED) that she was not aware of who took the decision in Congress to assign the Rs 90 crore loan of Associated Journals Ltd (AJL) to Young Indian, a not-for profit company in which she and her son Rahul Gandhi held 76% stake.""Motilal Vora, the then treasurer of Congress, would have been aware of this as he was empowered to deal with administrative and financial matters,"" Sonia had told the investigators, the ED said in its chargesheet filed against her on April 9. Rahul took an identical stand, refusing to acknowledge the controversial transactions that have become the prime money laundering charges slapped by the agency against the two.Young Indian took over AJL's loan liability towards Congress for a mere Rs 50 lakh, and in the process took over the company that owned assets across India estimated at over Rs 2,000 crore, according to ED.Both Sonia and Rahul were directors in Young Indian when these transactions happened, the agency said while accusing them of being involved in the conspiracy to siphon off assets of AJL that actually belonged to the Congress party.Based on details of Rahul's interrogation by ED investigators, TOI had in June 2016 exclusively reported that the Congress functionary had blamed the AJL-YI transactions to the late Motilal Vora. The agency was sceptical of the identical statements of mother and son as Sonia was then Congress president and Rahul was a general secretary in the party, besides being the majority shareholders in Young Indian and directors of the company. Vora was the party's treasurer for decades.Significantly, ED noted in its chargesheet that at the time it was transferred to Young Indian for Rs 50 lakh, AJL had an annual rental income of Rs 75 lakh. AJL's annual income shot up significantly after it was owned by the Gandhi family: from Rs 75 lakh to Rs 15 crore per annum by 2021-22.AJL, publisher of Congress mouthpiece National Herald and Quami Awaz, folded operations in 2008 after providing VRS to its remaining staff. However, it continued to make revenue by renting out its premises in Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow and other cities. Later, after taking over the company, the promoters/directors of Young Indian further developed these properties and raised the annual rental income to Rs 15 crore.While Sonia told ED that ""she was not aware why a new entity Young Indian was incorporated for assignment of the alleged loan of Rs 90 crore so as to do away with the non-recoverable loan of AJL when the same could have been achieved simply by writing off the loan"", Rahul had said he was not aware where the Rs 50 lakh came from in Young Indian to settle the AJL loan (with Congress).Both Sonia and Rahul refused to produce documentary evidence to support their claim that late Vora was authorised to take the decision of assigning AJL's loan to YI and in return, transferring the entire company and its properties to the new entity privately owned by them.","Sonia and rahul gandhi were directors in young indian when these transactions happened.

Supreme Court stay on Tasmac probe a setback for ED,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-stay-on-tasmac-probe-a-setback-for-ed/articleshow/121348249.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court's stay on ED investigation against Tasmac, Tamil Nadu govt entity responsible for distribution of liquor in the state, has come as a setback and surprise for the agency which, validated by Madras high court order, had intensified its probe into the case leading to ""discovery of evidence"" of alleged collusion of distilleries and bottlers with officials in selling liquor above the maximum retail price as part of a scam.SC faulted the agency for conducting searches on Tasmac when no 'predicate offence' had been registered against state govt undertaking. ED sources pointed out that Madras HC, in a detailed order, had struck down the challenge made on the same ground. In its order, HC had addressed the state govt's objection and held that a predicate offence, or FIR, was not mandatory to initiate an investigation under PMLA.Sources also said the two-judge HC bench of Justices S M Subramaniam and K Rajasekar, in its April 23 order, had rejected Tamil Nadu govt's plea that ED, before carrying out any search and seizure operation on a state-owned entity, must take ""prior consent"" from state govt to maintain sanctity of the federal structure.The bench had dismissed three writ petitions filed by TN govt and Tasmac seeking to stop ED investigation into the alleged liquor scam.The HC bench had said the precondition of getting consent from the state before conducting search was ""completely illogical and bereft of conscience"". ""How can a raid or search be conducted on a state-owned company in a surprise manner if permission is to be obtained beforehand? How can a search by an investigating agency even hold good if such absurd conditions are made?"" the two judges had asked.On Thursday, SC observed that the agency had transgressed the federal structure.Sources said in searches at various premises of Tasmac on March 6, ED found ""evidence"" of manipulation in supply orders, payment of bribes for allowing sale of liquor above MRP, grant of bar licences and transfer and posting of officials. The documents seized during the raids also revealed collusion of officials where excess charges of Rs 10-30 per bottle was illegally levied at retail outlets, sources said.","Sc faulted the agency for conducting searches on tasmac when no 'predicate offence' had been registered against state govt undertaking.

"Yamuna dirtier in May, pollution load in major drains increases too",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/yamuna-dirtier-in-may-pollution-load-in-major-drains-increases-too/articleshow/121348245.cms,"NEW DELHI: The pollution in the Yamuna spiked in May with a substantial rise in fecal levels, phosphates and ammonia. Delhi Pollution Control Committee's monthly analysis shows that while the river was more polluted at its exit from the city at Asgarpur, it also entered the city at Palla with substantial pollution levels. The samples of the river were collected on May 1, a day before the city recorded heavy rains. The pollution load in major drains like Maharani Bagh, Shahdara and Najafgarh also increased in May.According to DPCC, while fecal coliform has increased since last month, the river also recorded a spike in ammonia, with the ammoniacal nitrogen levels doubling to 5.7mg/litre from 2.3mg/l last month. The fecal coliform level reading was 23 lakh MPN/100ml in May, much higher than the 15 lakh MPN/100ml in April.Experts, however, were concerned about the various test readings published by DPCC. Pankaj Kumar, environmentalist and founder of Earth Warrior, said, ""If fecal coliform is high, then biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) must also increase. However, we see that BOD at Nizamuddin Bridge is 37mg/l and fecal level is 2.4 lakh MPN/100ml. At the next station at Okhla barrage, BOD drops to 23 and fecal coliform increases to 3.3 lakh.DPCC must recheck this rather big anomaly. At Palla, the dissolved oxygen (DO) level is 9.8mg/l and BOD is 4, which seems a bit unlikely because for DO as high as 9.8, BOD must be 1-2mg/l.""Another expert pointed out that high DO levels upstream of Wazirabad could depict algal growth. ""If there is algal growth, then DO increases during the day and drops at night due to respiration. A DO of 9.8 mg/l appears out of proportion. Or it means there are nutrients like phosphate and nitrogen in the water. It is necessary, therefore, to carry out more testing,"" the expert said.A Delhi govt official added, ""Also, at Wazirabad BOD in Feb was 9mg/l, 7mg/l in March and 6mg/l in April and May; these are not even standards for bathing water. Is Delhi Jal Board also monitoring this?"" The permissible BOD for the Yamuna is 3mg/l.","Pollution in the yamuna spiked in may with a substantial rise in fecal levels, phosphates and ammonia. While fecal coliform has increased since last month, the river also recorded a spike in ammonia.
