SC to examine their power to interfere in quasi-judicial functionsNew Delhi: Can parliamentary and legislative committees interfere in the quasi-judicial work of the revenue department? The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to examine this question arising from the directions issued by a parliamentary committee in the UP Assembly in a land dispute case.Appearing for a petitioner, senior advocate Amit Anand Tiwari told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi that multiple directions have been issued by the Uttar Pradesh govt, on the instructions of legislative committees, to revenue officers asking them to take “necessary action” and submit report on the land dispute.“Such directions directly and substantially impinge on free and independent adjudication by the revenue authorities in pending proceedings,” Tiwari said, which prompted the bench to entertain the petition and say that the question of law arising in this case is – “Whether legislative committees can interfere in quasi-judicial functions of revenue authorities?”The issue pertained to demarcation and determination of possession of a plot, which according to the petitioner could be gone into by the competent authority, in this case the sub-divisional magistrate, under the UP Revenue Code.Tiwari said a proper and effective adjudication by the revenue authorities is not possible if there is regular and constant interference from the legislative Committees. He said the Allahabad HC erred by failing to issue appropriate directions to prevent interference by political authorities in the adjudicatory process before Revenue Authorities.The petitioner informed SC that he had filed a complaint before the Assistant Collector, Meja, Prayagraj under section 67 of the Uttar Pradesh Revenue Code, 2006 against one R P Shukla, who using his influence, had encroached upon the public lands causing great hardships and obstruction to people in pursuing their agricultural activities.“While the petitioner was diligently pursuing the remedies available to him under the law, questions were being raised in the Vidhan Sabha and directions were being issued by the Secretariat to Revenue Officers asking them to take necessary action and to submit report regarding the land dispute concerning RP Shukla,” he alleged.",Sc to examine their power to interfere in quasi-judicial functions.

KOCHI: In a setback for the Kerala governor, the high court on Monday dismissed petitions challenging a single bench decision that declared 'illegal' the appointment of two temporary vice-chancellors for Kerala University of Digital Sciences Innovation and Technology and APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU), made without the recommendation of the state govt.A division bench of Justices Anil K Narendran and P V Balakrishnan rejected the appeals filed by the governor-cum-chancellor and temporary VCs of the digital university and KTU, Ciza Thomas and K Sivaprasad, respectively.Taking note of the prolonged administrative stalemate in both universities and its adverse impact on their functioning and students, the court urged the chancellor and the state government to act proactively and ensure regular appointments to the posts without further delay.The appeals primarily challenged the single bench's finding that appointments made without the government's recommendation are bad in law, citing that the university acts mandate such recommendation and limit the tenure of temporary VCs to six months.They also questioned the legality of these provisions, contending that they are inconsistent with the UGC Regulations. The bench, however, rejected this contention, holding that the UGC Regulations, 2010 and 2018, are silent on the appointment of temporary VCs.",Hc urged the chancellor and the state government to ensure regular appointments to the posts without further delay.

Six death-row convicts await HC verdict for over 3 yrs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/six-death-row-convicts-await-hc-verdict-for-over-3-yrs/articleshow/122476178.cms,"6 death-row convicts await J’khand high court verdict for over 3 years.

HC reserved verdicts in early 2022, yet to pronounce.NEW DELHI: In an unprecedented judicial inaction causing anxiety and uncertainty to those under the shadow of death sentence, the Jharkhand high court had reserved verdicts more than three years ago on appeals filed by six death-row convicts challenging their convictions and capital sentences and is yet to pronounce verdicts.Arguing their appeals filed in the supreme court through its legal services committee against non-pronouncement of judgments for years, advocate Fauzia Shakil told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi that it is a serious infraction of the right to speedy justice.Justice Kant asked whether these judgments were reserved by the same Judge who was called out by the apex court on an earlier occasion for similar inaction in delivering judgments. Shakil answered in the affirmative and said though these are 10 judgments which are reserved for a long time, the status report submitted by the HC on delayed pronouncement of verdicts to the SC did not reflect eight of them.Interestingly, in all these 10 appeals – six of whom have been awarded death sentence and rest life terms in murder cases – justice Rongon Mukhopadhyay is the presiding judge of the benches which heard and reserved verdicts in nine cases between Jan 2022 and Aug 2022 and in one in Aug 2023.The death-row convicts are Nitesh Sahu (judgment on appeal reserved on Aug 28, 2022), Sanatan Baski (Feb 3, 2022), Sukhlal Murmu (Feb 3, 2022), Gandhi Oraon (Jan 10, 2022), Rohit Rai (Jan 25, 2022) and Bandhan Oran (Jan 13, 2022).Earlier a similar inaction by the HC in pronouncing judgments in four cases of lifers was brought to the notice of the SC through Shakil and a bench led by Justice Kant had sought a status report from the HC about such cases being kept in limbo. Within a week of the SC entertaining the four cases, the HC had pronounced the verdicts which were reserved for years. Three were acquitted and in one there was a split verdict entitling the accused bail.Shakil informed the apex court that among the present 10 petitioners have been convicted and sentenced to death or life imprisonment. “It is pertinent to note that each one of them has served an actual custody period ranging between over 6 years to over 16 years,” she said.The petitioners pointed out that non-pronouncement of judgments by the HC for more than three years breached the Jharkhand HC Rules, 2001, which provided that “Reserved judgments should ordinarily be pronounced within six weeks of the conclusion of the arguments. In the event of the judgments not being pronounced within three months of the conclusion of the arguments, the chief justice may either post the case for delivering judgment in open Court or withdraw the case and post it for disposal before an appropriate Bench. ”","6 death-row convicts await j’khand high court verdict for over 3 years.

Maoist mines turn Saranda's forest into jumbo killing fields,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maoist-mines-turn-sarandas-forest-into-jumbo-killing-fields/articleshow/122476369.cms,"Asia’s largest sal forest spread across 900sqkm in Jharkhand’s West Singhbhum hides death beneath its green pall

RANCHI/JAMSHEDPUR: Gunfire didn't ring out in the forest. It cracked with the weight of an elephant's scream. A six-year-old female collapsed near a stream, leg mangled, bleeding into the mud. Four days later, a 15-year-old bull dropped dead deeper in the jungle, a Maoist IED buried under the red soil of Saranda, triggered by a footstep.Asia's largest sal forest spread across 900sqkm in Jharkhand's West Singhbhum hides death beneath its green pall. Elephants are walking into Maoist landmines, traps meant for troops. Two deaths in one week. Officials fear more lie wounded and unseen.Search patrols sweep elephant trails and riverbanks. Drones buzz low above watering holes. Five are deployed, but monsoonal rain, foliage and fog obscure visibility. ""We first got wind of a wounded elephant weeks ago,"" said DFO Aviroop Sinha. ""It was only on June 28 that we managed to spot it through drone feed and send help.""Teams are working across four divisions - Kolhan, Porahat, Chaibasa, and Saranda - each step a gamble. ""It's hostile terrain,"" Sinha said. ""Security concerns make it worse.But we've deployed field patrols wherever we can."" IEDs have long turned Saranda's forest trails into minefields. Since November 2022, at least six security personnel have been killed and more than two dozen wounded during combing operations. Maoists and breakaway factions have laid explosives across the forest - old ones buried years ago, fresh ones planted in 2024 and 2025.Civilians aren't spared either. Twenty villagers have died - some while collecting firewood, others while foraging for mahua. In Saranda, every path winds into uncertainty - for soldier, villager, and elephant alike. ""We have no maps, no numbers, no idea how many explosives are buried out there,"" said a forester. ""We just move with caution and gut feeling.""The forest department has begun treating IED-triggered elephant deaths as a conservation emergency. Field teams have been ordered not to enter unknown terrain. Surveillance focuses on riverbanks - likely spots for wounded elephants to rest. But with rain sweeping the region, even drone eyes fail.Regional chief conservator of forests Smita Pankaj said search ops are on high alert. But mobility remains limited. ""We're also planning a joint effort with Odisha's Rourkela and Keonjhar divisions, as elephants use trans-border corridors,"" she said. Just recently, a herd of 40 moved from Saranda to Karampada in Odisha.Wildlife expert DS Srivastava called the elephant casualties unprecedented. ""This is new,"" he said. Srivastava surveyed Saranda between 2015 and 2016. ""Even then, locals told us to avoid human trails,"" he said.Each footstep could be the last for man and wildlife alike. And when a trunk lifts to call for help, the cry often vanishes into the forest - an SOS swallowed by the Sal.","Asia's largest sal forest spread across 900sqkm in jharkhand's west singhbhum hides death.

RJD and other INDIA bloc constituents have questioned the veracity of these reports, while BJP insists that should be worrying only for the opposition.""After two rounds of door-to-door visits by BLOs, enumeration forms of 6.6 crore electors in Bihar have been collected...Only 11.82 per cent of electors now remain,"" EC said on Monday.

He could be suspended pending an inquiry, officials said.EC statement said many people had sought time to submit their enumeration forms with documents supporting their status as voters.""Nearly 1 lakh BLOs will soon begin their third round of door-to-door visits.

NEW DELHI: In a major setback to over 1,000 assistant professors appointed in 2021 in Panjab University and Guru Nanak Dev University, the Supreme Court on Monday quashed their recruitment, observing that it was done in violation of UGC regulations.Recruitment was done for 1,091 posts of assistant professor and 67 posts of librarian. The court said it is a settled principle that when the law prescribes a thing to be done in a particular manner, then it should be done in that manner alone.""In the present case, there are multiple deficiencies.

BALASORE: A 20-year-old student of a govt college in Balasore district sustained critical burn injuries after she allegedly set herself on fire outside the college premises on Saturday over alleged sexual harassment by a teacher.A male student, who tried to save her, also sustained burn injuries. Police have arrested the teacher while the govt has suspended the college principal as well as the accused. The condition of the girl, who has been shifted to AIIMS Bhubaneswar with 90% burns, is said to be critical.The second-year student of integrated BEd programme apparently tried to kill herself following prolonged harassment by a senior faculty member and alleged institutional apathy towards her complaints.According to witnesses, she set herself ablaze near the main gate of the college during a peaceful protest that had been going on since July 1 demanding action against the head of the education department (HoD).Students and friends of the girl claimed she had previously filed complaints accusing the HoD of mental harassment, misbehaviour and threats to manipulate her academic performance by lowering her internal marks unless she gave in to his sexual demands.""She told us multiple times that she was being harassed by the head of the department. He allegedly demanded undue favours and threatened to fail her if she didn't comply,"" said a fellow student, who had witnessed the horrifying scene.The incident occurred shortly after noon.

We’ll remember martyrs on any day, if not July 13: Omar

SRINAGAR: J&K CM Omar Abdullah climbed over a wall at Srinagar’s Naqshband Sahib shrine Monday after police denied entry to him and several cabinet members attempting to pay tribute to the 1931 martyrs at their graves.“I was subjected to physical grappling,” Omar said. “I’m made of sterner stuff. I was doing nothing unlawful or illegal. The so-called protectors of the law need to explain under what law they were trying to stop us.”Authorities had sealed the site a day earlier and placed several politicians, including Omar, his father and National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah, and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti under house arrest — intensifying a political standoff between the Union territory’s elected govt and Centre-appointed lieutenant governor’s administration.Determined not to be thwarted again, Omar avoided notifying anyone Monday. The confrontation began after the CM and his ministers headed to the shrine. Blocked by police barricades and CRPF vehicles, he and deputy CM Surinder Choudhary proceeded on foot. Minister Sakina Itoo arrived on a scooter, while Farooq came in a three-wheeler.“They blocked our way with CRPF and police vehicles and even resorted to physical force,” Omar said.He alleged that police tried to tear the NC flag and manhandled party workers.A video shared by Omar shows him scaling the shrine’s wall after being refused entry. “We succeeded in offering prayers,” he said. “They think these graves matter only on July 13. If not July 13, then July 12, 14, or any other day — we will come and remember the martyrs.”Observed as Martyrs’ Day on July 13, the date marks the killing of 22 civilians outside Srinagar jail in 1931 during protests against Maharaja Hari Singh, then Dogra monarch of J&K. The event has become a flashpoint in Kashmir’s evolving identity after Article 370 was revoked in 2019. Since then, police and security forces have been under the direct command of LG Manoj Sinha, while the Omar-led elected government has no authority over law enforcement.Omar quoted BJP stalwart Arun Jaitley to underline the friction. “Democracy in J&K is a tyranny of the unelected,” he said. “The unelected nominees of New Delhi locked up the elected representatives of the people.”Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq rubbed it in. “The CM tasted the bitter medicine of authoritarian high-handedness and experienced what ordinary Kashmiris endure,” he said. “I hope this experience shifts his focus to restoring dignity and fundamental rights.”","J&k cm omar abdullah climbed over a wall at srinagar’s naqshband sahib shrine.

NEW DELHI: The income tax department Monday launched a nationwide verification operation targeting individuals and entities facilitating fraudulent claims of deductions and exemptions in I-T returns.The exercise is not limited to deductions for donations to little-known political parties and charities but also those related to health insurance and medical expenses (Sec 80D and 80DDB of I-T Act), HRA (Sec 10(13A), interest on education and home loans and for purchase of vehicles (Sec 80E, 80EE and 80EEB), CBDT said.Those under lens are MNC staff, public sector companies, government bodies, academic institutions and entrepreneurs who have claimed deductions without valid justification, it said.The I-T department is now poised to take stern action against continued fraudulent claims, including penalties and prosecution wherever applicable. The ongoing verification exercise across 150 premises is expected to yield crucial evidence, including digital records, that will aid in dismantling networks behind these schemes and ensure accountability,"" the I-T dept said.This action follows a detailed analysis of ""misuse of tax benefits under I-T Act, 1961, often in collusion with professional intermediaries"", it said. It said that investigations have uncovered ""organised rackets"" operated by certain ITR preparers and intermediaries, who have been filing returns claiming fictitious deductions and exemptions. The move is a signal to individuals who take shortcuts and make claims without having evidence of deductions or expenses shown in returns.Tax authorities tapped multiple databases to identify likely offenders. It conducted search and seizures in several states, including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, Punjab, and MP, where it found evidence of fraudulent claims.CBDT said the actions follow an outreach conducted programme, asking taxpayers to revise their returns in case discrepancies were noticed. ""As a result, around 40,000 taxpayers have updated their returns in last four months, voluntarily withdrawing false claims amounting to Rs 1,045 crore. However, many remain non-compliant, possibly under influence of masterminds behind these evasion rackets,"" it said.","The exercise is not limited to deductions for donations to little-known political parties and charities.

Why the government said it can't save Nimisha Priya - the Houthi angle

Why was Priya sentenced?



NEW DELHI: ""There's a point till which Government of India can go. We have reached that point,"" attorney general of India R Venkataramani told the Supreme Court on Monday, during the hearing of a plea seeking to stall the execution of Keralite nurse Nimisha Priya in Yemen. The execution is tentatively scheduled for July 16.The top law officer said the government was keen to save its citizens and was doing the ""utmost possible"" in the matter.The bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehtawas was hearing a petition filed by an organisation seeking directions to the Centre to use diplomatic channels to intervene in the case of 38-year-old Nimisha Priya, who is on death row in Yemen for the murder of her Yemeni business partner.Attorney General R Venkataramani informed the bench that the government had made efforts through informal and indirect channels. He said a letter was sent to the public prosecutor in the region to explore the possibility of suspending the execution. ""The Government of India is trying its best,"" he said, adding that some influential sheikhs in the area were also approached.However, Venkataramani also outlined the limits of diplomatic outreach, citing the complex situation in Yemen.""Having regard to the sensitivity and status of Yemen as a place, there is nothing much the Government of India can do,"" he said. Referring to the Houthis who control the region, he added that they are ""not even diplomatically recognised."" It was stated that India has no embassy in Yemen, and had Nimisha Priya been lodged in universally recognized-Aden, instead of Houthi-controlled Sanaa, the situation could have been different, Live Law reported.He told the court that the situation was not comparable to other parts of the world where formal inter-governmental negotiations are possible. ""It is very complex,"" he said, ""and we don't want to complicate the situation by going too much public."" The government, he added, had received an informal communication suggesting that the execution ""is kept under abeyance,"" but said, ""We don't know how far to believe that. ""On the possibility of blood money, he said, ""Blood money is a private negotiation,"" and stressed that the government could not be asked to act beyond its defined limits. ""It is not a matter where the government can be asked to do something beyond the defined limit. It is not possible,"" Venkataramani said.The bench noted that the petitioners were not seeking funds from the government but only assistance in establishing contact with the deceased’s family to negotiate the payment of blood money, which is permissible under Yemeni law.""They (petitioner) are saying they may be able to arrange for the blood money. The only question is the negotiating link,"" the bench observed.It remarked that the case was concerning. ""The real cause of concern is the manner in which the incident took place and in spite thereof, if she loses her life, that is really sad.""The court posted the matter for further hearing on July 18 and asked all parties to inform it of any developments.The counsel representing ‘Save Nimisha Priya – International Action Council’ told the court that Priya’s mother was in Yemen along with a social worker to initiate talks with the family of the deceased. ""The only thing that is possible today to avoid death sentence is the family of the deceased agreeing to accept blood money,"" he said.He pointed out that the final legal appeal had already been rejected by the Supreme Judicial Council of Yemen, and the death sentence had been confirmed under the country’s Sharia law. The counsel said diplomatic channels needed to be explored urgently given the tentative execution date.He also emphasised that the petitioners were not asking for funds from the government and would arrange the required compensation themselves.Nimisha Priya, a nurse from Kerala’s Palakkad district, was convicted in 2020 for the murder of her Yemeni business partner Talal Abdo Mahdi. Yemeni court documents state that in July 2017, Priya allegedly drugged Mahdi and, with the help of another nurse, killed him. His body was then dismembered and disposed of in an underground water tank.Priya had partnered with Mahdi in 2015 to open a clinic in Sana’a, the capital of Yemen, since local laws require a Yemeni national to register any such business, the plea said. The same year, Mahdi had accompanied Priya on a visit to Kerala.Her petitioners have argued that Priya did not receive a fair trial due to the ongoing civil war in Yemen at the time. They described her as a ""victim of war"" and said she lacked adequate legal defence during her trial. Priya remains imprisoned in Sana’a.","Nimisha priya is on death row in yemen for the murder of her yemeni business partner. The execution is tentatively scheduled for july 16.

Yes No

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday told the Supreme Court that it has limited ability to intervene in the case of Nimisha Priya, an Indian nurse from Kerala who is facing execution in Yemen for murder, calling it a “very complex issue” with few diplomatic levers available.Appearing before a bench headed by Justice Sandeep Mehta, the Attorney General of India (AGI) said, “There’s no way we can know what’s happening [in Yemen].” He added that the government is in touch with Yemeni authorities, including the public prosecutor, and is trying to delay Priya’s execution while discussions continue.The court was informed that the only viable option left to save Priya’s life is a blood money, settlement, provided the family of the deceased Yemeni national is willing to accept it. “The parties may apprise the Court on the next date about the status of the case,” the bench noted in its order while scheduling the next hearing for July 18.Nimisha Priya, who has been imprisoned since 2017, is currently being held in Sana’a Central Prison and is tentatively set to be executed on Tuesday, July 16. The apex court took up the matter after senior advocate Ragenth Basant mentioned it for urgent hearing. The plea, filed by the Save Nimisha Priya Action Council, seeks government intervention via diplomatic channels.The court had earlier directed that a copy of the petition be served to the AGI and asked the Centre to inform the court of the steps taken so far.According to news agency PTI, a source said, ""The family of the deceased, Talal Abdo Mehdi, is not even willing to accept blood money. All legal efforts have been made for Nimisha Priya, but the allegations against her were so grave that all efforts have failed.""Priya, a nurse from Kollengode in Kerala’s Palakkad district, moved to Yemen in 2008 and worked in hospitals before opening her own clinic. In 2017, she reportedly got into a dispute with her business partner, Talal Abdo Mahdi, over alleged misappropriation of funds. According to her family, she injected him with sedatives to recover her confiscated passport, but the dosage led to his death.Priya was arrested while attempting to flee the country and was convicted of murder in 2018. A trial court in Sanaa sentenced her to death in 2020, and Yemen’s Supreme Judicial Council upheld the verdict in November 2023. However, the Council also kept open the option of a blood money settlement, in accordance with Sharia law.Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has also urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to act immediately. In a letter sent Sunday, Vijayan wrote, “Considering the fact that this is a case deserving sympathy, I appeal to the Hon’ble Prime Minister to take up the matter and intervene with the authorities concerned to save the life of Smt. Nimisha Priya.” He referred to earlier appeals made in February and March 2025.Priya’s mother, Prema Kumari, has travelled to Yemen in an attempt to negotiate a blood money settlement. Her efforts have been supported by the Save Nimisha Priya International Action Council, a collective of NRI social workers operating in Yemen.","Nimisha priya, an indian nurse from kerala, is facing execution in yemen for murder.

Toll may be halved for 2-lane national highways undergoing expansion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/toll-may-be-halved-for-2-lane-national-highways-undergoing-expansion/articleshow/122470281.cms,"File photo: Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari (Picture credit: PTI)

NEW DELHI: In yet another move to rationalise tolling on national highways (NHs), the road transport ministry has proposed to halve the toll during the expansion of 10-metre-wide two-lane highways with paved shoulders to four-lane highways. This has been proposed since commuters don't get the desired service while construction work is underway on such stretches, with the highway width available for use being reduced.At present, the user fee for such stretches is 60 per cent of the normal toll for NHs, even during expansion phase, as they are narrow highways without dividers. If the proposal goes through and gets the green signal from the finance ministry, the user fee will go down to only 30 per cent of the normal toll during the construction phase.In the case of widening of four-lane highways to six lanes or expanding six-lane highways to eight lanes, the chargeable toll is capped at 75 per cent of the normal rate during the construction phase.This is also because commuters don't get the desired service while work is underway on such stretches. This has also been a major issue, with there even being instances of courts taking note of the anomaly.The proposal to give relief to commuters using two-lane NHs with paved shoulders gains importance considering road transport minister Nitin Gadkari has announced a plan to convert 25,000 km of two-lane highways into four-lane highways with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore in the next two years.The govt will be focusing over the next decade on the expansion of two-lane and two-lane with paved shoulders NH stretches, as nearly 80,000 km out of the total 1.46-lakh-km length of NHs fall under this category.Earlier, to provide relief to commuters, govt had announced the Rs-3,000 annual toll pass scheme, which will allow private vehicles to cross 200 toll plazas annually.More recently, it notified a new rule to reduce the toll rate by up to 50 per cent for structures such as bridges, tunnels, flyovers and elevated sections on highways, which will benefit commercial and heavy vehicles.","Road transport ministry has proposed to halve the toll during the expansion of 10-metre-wide two-lane highways with paved shoulders.
