Thiruvananthapuram: A couple and their two sons were found dead at their home in Vakkom, in Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram district, on Tuesday. Police suspected a suicide pact, with a preliminary inquiry suggesting a financial crisis as the possible trigger.The deceased were identified as Anil Kumar (55), his wife Sheeja (50), and their sons, Ashwin (25) and Akash (22). Anil worked as a senior clerk at Vakkom Service Cooperative Bank while Sheeja was a daily-wage worker at the legislative assembly. Ashwin had completed BCom and was searching for a job, while Akash was an engineering student in Chirayinkeezhu. Sheeja often spoke about the family's mounting debts, said ward member Santhamma S. The financial strain began after they took a large bank loan to renovate a house purchased some years ago. ""Matters worsened in 2019 when Ashwin was seriously injured in an accident, resulting in multiple fractures. He was hospitalised for six months, and the family incurred heavy medical expenses, adding to their already growing debt,"" Santhamma said.","The deceased were identified as anil kumar (55), his wife sheeja (50), and their sons, ashwin (25) and akash (22) police suspected a suicide pact, with a preliminary inquiry suggesting a financial crisis as the possible trigger.

Rape accused gets 1-month bail to marry survivor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rape-accused-gets-1-month-bail-to-marry-survivor/articleshow/121450373.cms,"Representative image

CUTTACK: Orissa high court has granted a 26-year-old rape accused one-month bail to marry a 22-year-old woman he is accused of raping when she was 16, observing that their relationship was consensual, not forced or exploitative.""The allegations, though serious in their statutory framing, arise out of a consensual relationship between two individuals who are very close in age and shared a personal bond prior to the filing of the present case,"" Justice S K Panigrahi said in the bail order uploaded on Monday. The man was jailed under Pocso Act in 2023 on the woman's complaint that he had maintained physical relationship with her since 2019 on the promise of marriage. She complained that she had become pregnant twice in 2020 and 2022, and both times he forced her to terminate the pregnancy.The man had recently moved court for interim bail, claiming that his and the woman's families have agreed that the petitioner should marry the complainant. ""The petitioner has expressed his consent to this arrangement and has undertaken to solemnize the marriage upon his release,"" the man's lawyer told the court.The court noted, ""The possibility of reconciliation, the familial understanding now reached, and the future prospects of both parties further tilt the balance in favour of extending temporary liberty without compromising the integrity of the ongoing investigation or the dignity of the prosecutrix.""","The man was jailed under pocso act in 2023 on the woman's complaint that he had maintained physical relationship with her since 2019 on the promise of marriage.

"Punjab and Haryana HC trashes 'evidence', overturns death sentence of 2 in rape-murder",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/punjab-and-haryana-hc-trashes-evidence-overturns-death-sentence-of-2-in-rape-murder/articleshow/121450314.cms,"Representative image

CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has ruled that the mere recovery of a weapon or bloodstains on an accused's clothes is not enough to prove guilt in a murder case. Emphasising the need for substantive evidence, the court held that such findings, without direct links to the crime, cannot establish that the accused committed the offence.The HC passed these orders while overturning death sentences of two persons convicted in the gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old woman eight years ago in Haryana's Sonipat district.According to the prosecution, on May 9, 2017, the accused abducted the victim in a car, raped her and then murdered her. The teenager's mutilated body was recovered in Rohtak on May 11, with as many as 15 injuries. Her mother alleged that accused Sumit had kidnapped her daughter.Following her statement, the accused were arrested and Sumit confessed to the police that he and his friend, Vikas Yadav, had committed the offence, the prosecution had claimed On Dec 19, 2022, Sonipat district court convicted and awarded death sentence to both appellants, who then challenged the capital punishment before the HC.Acquitting the accused of murder charges, the HC pointed out serious gaps and procedural lapses in collection and handling of DNA evidence sent to Forensic Science Laboratory in Karnal.A division bench of justices Gurvinder Singh Gill and Jasjit Singh Bedi passed these orders while allowing the appeal filed by the accused. Their counsel, Jasdev Singh Mehandiratta contended that the case was based on circumstantial evidence and the chain of circumstantial evidence was not complete to warrant conviction.""We are conscious of the heinous nature of the offence but at the same time, the prosecution must establish its case beyond reasonable doubt which it has been unable to do. In fact, from the evidence on record, there is no evidence of the deceased having been kidnapped, intoxicated, subjected to gangrape and thereafter murdered by none other than the present accused,"" held the bench.","The hc passed these orders while overturning death sentences of two persons convicted in the gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old woman eight years ago in haryana's sonipat district.

Calcutta HC: Pet owners must ensure animals don’t harm others,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/calcutta-hc-pet-owners-must-ensure-animals-dont-harm-others/articleshow/121449979.cms,"Calcutta HC

KOLKATA: Pet owners must ensure their animals do not harm others, Calcutta high court has said in a recent order, turning down a man's plea to quash a criminal case pertaining to a dog attack on a neighbour.""The potential gravity of a dog attack on a human, capable of causing serious injury or even posing a threat to life, cannot be overstated. Therefore, a pet owner is undeniably duty-bound to exercise a certain degree of care and take sufficient steps to prevent their pet from causing harm,"" Justice Uday Kumar said in his order on May 23.The pet owner from Sonarpur, on Kolkata's outskirts, was charged under Section 289 of IPC, pertaining to ""negligent conduct with respect to animals"". This followed a complaint from the neighbour alleging he was attacked by 10-12 of the man's pet dogs on the terrace of their apartment building in 2022, leading to injuries.In his HC plea, the pet owner said the charges were based on ""falsehood and inaccuracies"". He claimed he had only one dog and that a medical report of the complainant mentioned there was ""no obvious external injury"".But Justice Kumar cited IPC Section 289 to say it imposed a ""duty on the owner or possessor of an animal"" to take adequate measures to prevent any probable danger to human life or grievous hurt to others.The judge pointed out that the section specifically uses the words ""knowingly or negligently omits"", emphasising either actual knowledge of the animal's harmful propensity or a lack of due care in its management.While the police chargesheet mentioned that ""10-12 dogs"" belonged to the accused, the pet owner disputed it, highlighting the absence of documentary and photographic evidence. Justice Kumar held that the accused could highlight these lapses during trial, adding the HC could not assume ""the role of a fact-finding authority"".""Even if the injury was not externally obvious, being attacked by 10-12 dogs and falling on a roof could potentially lead to internal injuries, non-visible bruises, or psychological trauma. Furthermore, the complaint highlights a broader concern regarding the practice of keeping 'many dogs...unchained on the roof of a housing (complex)', which, if true, could indeed pose a threat to human life, regardless of immediate physical injury,"" the judge observed.","Calcutta hc turns down a man's plea to quash a criminal case pertaining to a dog attack on a neighbour.

Maharashtra and Karnataka step up vigilance

Delhi and Telangana maintain guard

National situation and expert assessment

India is witnessing a steady uptick in Covid-19 cases, with new infections reported across several states including Maharashtra, Karnataka, Delhi and Telangana. While the overall numbers remain relatively low, health authorities have stepped up surveillance and urged precaution, especially for vulnerable populations. Governments at both state and central levels have assured citizens that there is no cause for alarm and that necessary measures are in place to manage the current wave.In Thane, 24 new Covid-19 cases were reported on Tuesday. Nine patients are currently hospitalised, while 46 others are under home quarantine. One patient with diabetes-related complications died at a civic hospital last week. The Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) confirmed its first COVID-19 fatality, with one out of four newly detected patients succumbing to the virus. Two others remain under treatment, while one has recovered. Authorities have readied isolation wards and issued advisories urging mask usage among high-risk individuals, alongside basic hygiene and distancing measures.The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) also reported 36 active cases in total, with one death.Nine patients are hospitalized and 20 are recovering at home.In Karnataka, Medical Education Minister Sharan Prakash Patil reassured the public following a Covid-19 preparedness meeting with officials from state-run medical colleges. He stated that while daily cases are rising, particularly in Bengaluru, the situation remains manageable. Health workers have been directed to wear masks, and precautionary masking is advised for pregnant women and senior citizens. As schools are set to reopen, students showing symptoms of fever or cold should remain at home, with testing encouraged for all cases of severe respiratory illness. The government is also reviewing availability of oxygen beds, ventilators and medicines as part of its broader preparedness strategy.Delhi has crossed the 100-mark in active Covid-19 cases, with 104 currently reported. Chief minister Rekha Gupta described the infection as seasonal in nature and urged the public not to panic. She assured that hospitals are prepared, and that COVID-19 is no longer an emergency but more akin to a viral flu. The Delhi government has issued an advisory to ensure readiness of beds, oxygen, medicines and vaccines.In Telangana, only one case has been recorded recently. Nevertheless, Health Minister C Damodar Rajanarasimha convened a meeting with experts and health officials on Monday. The consensus was that COVID-19 does not pose a significant public health threat at this stage. Experts emphasized that India has achieved substantial herd immunity and that current infections are generally mild. However, caution is advised for those with existing health conditions or weakened immunity. The state is also monitoring for other seasonal and vector-borne illnesses such as dengue and chikungunya.As of Monday, India’s total active Covid-19 cases stood at 1,009, up from 257 the previous week. Kerala leads with 430 cases, followed by Maharashtra (209), Delhi (104), and Gujarat (83). Six deaths have been reported over the past week—three in Maharashtra, two in Kerala, and one in Karnataka.Health experts attribute the rise to new sub-variants of the virus that are capable of evading existing immunity from past infections or vaccinations. Dr Rajiv Bahl, Director General of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), noted that while the new variants show increased transmissibility, there is no evidence suggesting they cause severe illness. He added that ongoing surveillance through national networks is helping track the spread and mutation of the virus.Doctors across major hospitals have also reported that Covid-19 symptoms now closely resemble those of the common cold or flu, making it difficult to distinguish without testing. While most infections are mild, experts advise those with underlying health conditions to remain vigilant and seek medical care early if symptoms arise.Authorities continue to emphasize mask use for symptomatic individuals, regular hand hygiene, and avoidance of crowded places for at-risk groups. While the rise in cases warrants attention, officials maintain that the situation is stable and under control.","India is witnessing a steady uptick in covid-19 cases, with new infections reported across several states including maharashtra, karnataka, delhi and telangana.

Tej Pratap, however, later claimed his account was hacked.Later, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad expelled Tej Pratap, citing ignorance of moral values and irresponsible behavior.“Ignoring moral values in personal life weakens our collective struggle for social justice.

Improve drainage and flood management Strengthen public transport and emergency response systems

MUMBAI: The southwest monsoon hit Mumbai on Monday - the earliest onset ever recorded for the city. The previous record was May 29, recorded in 1956, 1962, and 1971 (records date back to 1950). The early onset coincided with the island city breaking a 100-year-old record for rainfall received in May, which has now touched 295mm.Shubhangi Bhute, head of IMD Mumbai, said, ""Typically, the monsoon sets in around June 11, so this year's onset is significantly early... Tomorrow, Mumbai will be under a yellow alert.""IMD's Colaba observatory, which broke the all-time rainfall record for May, logging 439 mm so far, surpassed the previous record of 279.4 mm set in May 1918. Even during Cyclone Tauktae in May 2021, the station had recorded slightly less rain at 257.8 mm. The Santacruz observatory, which covers the suburbs, has so far recorded 272 mm of rain this month. The record for the highest rainall in May at Santacruz stands at 387mm in the year 2000.South Mumbai was hit hardest in the first wave of showers. According to IMD, average rainfall recorded between 8.30am and 5.30pm was 144.3 mm at Colaba - classified as ""very heavy rain"" (115.6-204.4 mm) - and 74.3 mm at Santacruz, falling under the ""heavy rain"" category (64.5-115.5 mm).However, more granular data from BMC's automatic weather stations revealed that Nariman Point alone received 104 mm of rain in just one hour on Monday morning.IMD, however, did not call this a cloudburst; it said it was an 'intense rain spell'. A cloudburst is typically defined as extremely intense rainfall over a small area, usually 100 mm or more in one hour, which often leads to flash floods, landslides, and severe water logging.The showers exposed the city's unpreparedness as areas which had never been flooded earlier also witnessed waterlogging, including the newly opened underground Acharya Atre Chowk Metro station. In fact, access to Mantralaya was partially waterlogged and govt employees had to wade through knee-deep water.Suburban train services, especially Harbour line, were hit by waterlogging. Over 50 Central Railway services and 18 Western Railway services were cancelled.Heavy rain and dense cloud cover also disrupted flight operations. An Air India flight from Ahmedabad to Mumbai was diverted back to Ahmedabad, while another from Goa was diverted to Indore, said sources.Wall and building collapses and tree fall were reported from Mahim, Malabar Hill, and Teen Batti area. A road in Kemps Corner cracked open. A dozen BEST buses were stuck on waterlogged roads and 20 routes diverted.","The southwest monsoon hit mumbai on monday - the earliest onset ever recorded for the city.

PM Modi Hails India Becoming Fourth-Largest Economy, Says Youth Cheered Surpassing United Kingdom

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday gave a strong message to Pakistan and said that till now India has kept the Indus water under abeyance, and has not taken any firm action yet, and still, Pakistan is sweating.While addressing Gandhinagar for day 2, PM Modi said he also talked about the 1960 Indus Water treaty and said that for the 60 years the gates built at the bottom of these dams on other rivers in Jammu and Kashmir, meant for cleaning, were not opened.""I want to speak to the new generation. Do you know how the country was ruined? If you look closely at the 1960 Indus water treaty, you’ll be shocked. It was even decided back then that the dams built on other rivers in Jammu and Kashmir would not be cleaned. Desilting would not be done. The gates at the bottom of these dams, meant for cleaning, would not be opened. For 60 years, those gates were never opened. And the reservoirs, which should have been filled to 100% capacity, gradually lost their capacity. It reduced to just 2% or 3%,"" PM Modi said.""Do my fellow countrymen not have a right to water? Shouldn’t they receive their rightful share of water? Shouldn’t they? And mind you, I haven’t even done much yet.All we’ve done is keep it under abeyance, and still, Pakistan is sweating. We’ve opened a few dam gates and started cleaning. We are removing the waste and debris. And even that much is making them panic,"" he added.Addressing the rally, he also talked about the series of terrorist incidents that have been going on for the last 75 years.and said that the time has come for India should answer bullets with shells and bricks should be answered with stones.""The terrorists undergo military training. These militarily trained terrorists are sent to India, and innocent, unarmed people become their victims — someone traveling, someone on a bus, someone sitting in a hotel, someone visiting as a tourist.

NEW DELHI: In a temporary reprieve for Turkish aviation firm Celebi, the Bombay high court on Monday directed Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) to hold off on awarding new contracts for ground and bridge handling services at the city's international airport.The interim order was passed by Justice Somasekhar Sundaresan, who said that no conclusive steps should be taken on the tenders until Celebi’s petitions are heard after the court’s summer recess in June, reported news agency PTI.The legal dispute stems from the recent revocation of security clearance for Celebi Airport Services India, a subsidiary of Turkey-based Celebi, by India’s Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS). The security clearance was rescinded earlier this month, citing national security concerns, prompting airports across the country to terminate contracts with Celebi’s Indian affiliates.The move followed diplomatic tensions after Turkey expressed support for Pakistan during India’s Operation Sindoor, a military offensive conducted in response to cross-border terrorism. In the aftermath, Celebi’s Indian operations, including those at key airports like Mumbai and Delhi, came under scrutiny.In Mumbai, Celebi Nas Airport Services India, which handles bridge and ground services, filed three separate petitions challenging both the BCAS's decision and MIAL’s termination of contracts. The company contended that the government’s actions were arbitrary and legally unsustainable. Celebi holds a 59 per cent stake in the joint venture operating at the Mumbai airport.The petitions request the high court to annul the BCAS’s order cancelling its security clearance and to reverse MIAL’s termination of key agreements, including the Bridge Mounted Equipment Service Agreement, Ground Handling Services contract, and the Concession Agreement. The firm also asked the court to suspend the tender process initiated by MIAL on May 17 for selecting a replacement agency.Meanwhile, two other group companies, Celebi Airport Services India and Celebi Delhi Cargo Terminal Management India, have approached the Delhi high court seeking similar relief following cancellation of their airport contracts in the capital.",The bombay high court on monday directed mumbai international airport limited to hold off on awarding new contracts for ground and bridge handling services at the city's international airport.

NEW DELHI: In a bold departure from tradition, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Tuesday chaired a special cabinet meeting in Pahalgam, the picturesque town that was rocked by a deadly terror attack last month, killing 26 people, mostly tourists.This is the first time since his government took office that a cabinet meeting has been held outside the summer capital Srinagar or winter capital Jammu. The decision to meet in Pahalgam, a key tourism hub, was more than symbolic.“Chaired a Cabinet Meeting at Pahalgam today. It was not just a routine administrative exercise, but a clear message, we are not intimidated by cowardly acts of terror,” read a post from the chief minister’s Office on X, alongside images of ministers seated at the Pahalgam Club.Abdullah said the move aimed to ""salute the courage of people"" and push back against fear. “The enemies of peace will never dictate our resolve. Jammu and Kashmir stands firm, strong, and unafraid,” his office declared.In a personal post on X, the chief minister added, “We came to express solidarity with the local population. We’ve also come to thank all the tourists who are slowly making their way back to Kashmir and to Pahalgam.”The April 22 attack had led to a steep drop in tourist arrivals, threatening livelihoods and fuelling fear. Officials say the cabinet’s presence in the town is a direct signal to anti-national forces that violence cannot dictate the region’s future.During the meeting, Abdullah also highlighted measures to revive tourism: “Sixty tour and tourism operators from Maharashtra are coming to Jammu and Kashmir. I thank all of them. Tourism should be conflict-neutral. From time to time it was used for politics. My government will insulate tourism from the situation.”The cabinet session comes days after Abdullah’s appeal to the Centre at the NITI Aayog Governing Council meeting. He urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to direct PSUs to conduct official meetings in Kashmir and convene parliamentary committee sessions here to boost the economy and public morale.Also read: J&K LG Sinha warns ‘terrorist state’ Pakistan against miadventure “This is not about politics,” he stressed in an earlier 26-minute speech in the Assembly. “I will not use this terror attack to push for restoration of statehood.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday strongly criticised the Uttar Pradesh government for intervening in a private legal dispute over the management of the iconic Shri Banke Bihari temple in Vrindavan, accusing it of “hijacking” the case.A bench of Justices BV Nagarathna and Satish Chandra Sharma questioned the state’s involvement, stating, “If states start entering private disputes, it will lead to a breakdown of the rule of law. You can’t hijack litigation between private parties.”The court was hearing a plea seeking modification of its earlier order that cleared the way for the UP government’s temple redevelopment plan.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal , representing petitioner Devendra Nath Gooswami, argued that Rs 300 crore was allocated to the state for the project without making his client, linked to the temple’s original founders, a party to the case, news agency PTI reported.“How can earnings of a private temple be handed over to the state through an order in an unrelated petition?” Sibal questioned.In response, the state's counsel said the government had created a trust to oversee the redevelopment and manage temple affairs, and that the funds would vest with the trust, not the government—under a specific ordinance.The bench directed the state to share a copy of the ordinance with the petitioner and asked the relevant principal secretary to file an affidavit by July 29.Earlier on May 15, the court had allowed the state to use temple funds for purchasing five acres of land around the shrine to develop facilities such as parking, toilets, and accommodation for devotees.However, on May 19, Gooswami—who claims to be a direct descendant of temple founder Swami Haridas Goswami—challenged the redevelopment plan, arguing it was unfeasible without consultation with those historically involved in the temple’s functioning. He warned it could disrupt the temple’s religious and cultural fabric.The Supreme Court’s earlier ruling had modified a November 2023 Allahabad High Court order that accepted the state’s development plan but barred use of temple funds.",The court was hearing a plea seeking modification of its earlier order that cleared the way for the up government’s temple redevelopment plan.

While Registration Act applies across the country, states can amend it in consultation with the Centre.The government is also seeking to allow for electronic registration certificates and digital maintenance of records. Apart from electronic presentation and admission of documents for registration, govt has proposed Aadhaar-based authentication with ‘informed consent’, along with other verification methods for those who do not wish to share their unique ID, as part of an exercise to reduce fraud.
