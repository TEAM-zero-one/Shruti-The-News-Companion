NEW DELHI: In a major policy change, the Centre is preparing a model to provide financial assistance to state govts for one-time improvement of state highways rather than declaring more of these as NHs. The road transport ministry will instead focus on building more new greenfield highways and expressways.This comes after PM Narendra Modi's direction to the ministry to come up with a model by July end for the purpose. State govts will maintain the upgraded state highways. TOI has learnt that in the last infrastructure review meeting, Modi had asked the ministry to come up with innovative models for supporting state highway projects and connecting non-major ports under state govts.This change in approach gains importance considering that in the last 11 years, govt has notified conversion of 55,000 km of state highways to NHs and now, the total length of NHs stands at 1.46 lakh km. This has been highlighted as one of the biggest achievements of govt.Sources said that after expanding the NH network, now there is a need to focus more on widening them and maintaining them. Data shows that till March, India has more than 63 lakh km of road network.","The road transport ministry will instead focus on building more new greenfield highways and expressways.

Delhi Judge Cash Row: SC Probe Panel Report Says Misconduct Proved, Proposes Justice Varma’s Removal

NEW DELHI: The inquiry committee on the Justice Varma cash case has rejected both theories put forth by the HC judge in his defence - that the cash could have been planted in the storeroom of his residence and that the storeroom was set afire by an act of arson to implicate him.The committee, constituted on March 22 by then CJI Sanjiv Khanna, comprised seasoned constitutional court judges - Punjab and Haryana Chief Justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Justice Anu Sivaraman.It examined 55 witnesses, including Justice Varma, which were video recorded, to confirm every report of TOI on the sensational controversy. The panel's report also referred to TOI's March 21 story breaking the news.Also read: SC panel proposes impeachment of Justice Yashwant Varma - What probe report said Rejecting Justice Varma's defence - that ""someone could have planted the cash in the storeroom in his absence as it was accessible to everyone"" - the panel in its 64-page report said, ""The overall control and the permission to have access to the storeroom was undeniably with Justice Varma.""This should remove all doubts about the launch of proceedings for removal of the HC judge in the monsoon session of Parliament beginning on July 21.The panel cited the fact that the judge was in control of the Tughlaq Crescent bungalow to reject his defence of conspiracy and arson - essentially that someone with mala fide intention planted the cash at his official bungalow and then set off the fire. Referring to statements of security personnel, the panel noted that no one could access the house without the permission of family members and ""therefore, it's well nigh impossible for currency to be planted in the storeroom of a sitting judge, which is being monitored by static 1+4 guard and a PSO stationed at the gate at all time, apart from the fact that the house abounds with a large number of old and trusted domestic servants with over six staff quarters"".The committee also disregarded the theory of ""arson"" - ""a criminal act of deliberately setting fire to property"" - belatedly flagged by Justice Varma. Members of the panel said that by the judge's own initial version, the fire was triggered by a short circuit, besides noting that he did not follow up by registering a police complaint.Significantly, the panel also underlined that the judge had quietly accepted his transfer to Allahabad HC, in the wake of publication of a report in TOI. ""The categorical acceptance on March 20, immediately, without any demur and, respectfully accepting the decision of repatriation to Allahabad would, in normal circumstances, only be done after discussion with family members at least and after an attempt to find out the reason for transfer, having served in Delhi HC for the last three years,"" the report said.""It is his categorical case that he has served diligently for a decade without any complaint. Thus, he would have liked to find out the reason for the transfer,"" it added.In conclusion, the inquiry panel said, ""In the absence of any plausible explanation coming from Justice Varma or his family members or, for that matter, any other witness, this committee is left with no option but to hold that the trust reposed in him was belied by him by allowing highly suspicious material in the shape of piles of currency notes to be stashed in the storeroom. Whether this stashing was done with tacit or explicit consent of Justice Varma or his family members is of little significance in the face of the larger concept of breach of public trust and probity expected of the high constitutional office held by Justice Varma. ""The committee repeatedly termed the post-cash discovery conduct of Justice Varma as ""unnatural"" and ""illogical"" and said, ""Keeping in view the direct and electronic evidence on record, this committee is firmly of the view that there is sufficient substance in the allegations raised in the letter of CJI (Sanjiv Khanna) dated March 22 and the misconduct found proved is serious enough to call for initiation of proceedings for removal of Justice Yashwant Varma. ""The committee also found it odd that the judge, who cut short his vacation in the Satpura forests after having been informed of the fire, did not deem it fit to visit the site until March 15 when the principal private secretary to the Delhi HC chief justice came for an inspection.The committee also stated that Justice Varma's daughter tried to dissuade firemen from entering the bungalow by telling them that the flames had already been controlled.The report said Justice Varma's private secretary, Delhi HC employee Rajinder Singh Karki, frantically tried to reach the judge on phone from the residence. ""He had a detailed conversation with Justice Varma at 1.23am on March 15"" when the judge asked him to stay back at the residence, the report said.It was Karki who instructed firemen not to mention burnt cash in their report, the panel said. It also found from the security guard's statement that Karki and a trusted servant, Mohd Rahil ""were busy supervising the cleaning up job after the fire wagons had left"".During questioning by the committee, Karki entangled himself in contradictory statements, the report said.The committee was also surprised to find that CCTV footage had been wiped out from the hard disc between March 15 and March 25, when the inquiry started.","The inquiry committee on the justice varma cash case has rejected both theories put forth by the hc judge in his defence. The committee, constituted on march 22 by then cji sanjiv khanna, comprised seasoned constitutional court judges.

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court Tuesday issued notice to the Bar Council of India (BCI) after a master's degree holder in law failed the All India Bar Examination (AIBE), which is essential for a law graduate to clear in order to become a lawyer.The AIBE follows an open book format designed to evaluate fundamental legal knowledge and establish a minimum competency benchmark for entry into the legal profession, alongside assessing candidates' analytical abilities.HC issued the notice after the candidate alleged lack of transparency in AIBE, as the body did not provide any justification for her failure, even after re-checking.The petition was filed by Urvi Acharya, who holds an LLM degree in criminal law. She appeared in the AIBE in Dec 2024 and was declared failed. She refused to accept the result and requested a re-checking. Even after re-checking, the department in BCI that conducts the AIBE conveyed that she failed the test.Acharya's counsel, advocate Pratik Jasani, told the court that seven of the 100 multiple-choice questions were officially withdrawn post-exam, which should have reduced the total score to 93, with the passing marks revised from 45 to 42.Jasani contended that the petitioner was a bright student and she passed her LLM in criminal law with first class.

"EWS quota bloc trails OBCs in UPSC mains, but turns tables in interviews",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ews-quota-bloc-trails-obcs-in-upsc-mains-but-turns-tables-in-interviews/articleshow/121999994.cms,"Representative Image

NEW DELHI: The upper castes availing the economic backwardness quota have trailed the backward classes in the Mains examinations of the Civil Services competition for the last two years. But the dynamic of competitiveness between the two reserved categories is complex, as the forwards have prevailed in the ultimate test by virtue of greater score in the 'interview' part of the competition.In the recent results for CS-2024, the cut-off for the Economically Weaker Sections category in the Civil Services (Main) exams was 696 marks as compared to 702 for the OBCs. But in the Final results after the interview, the EWS had a cut-off merit of 917 marks as against 910 for the OBCs. Under the EWS category, the non-SC/ST/OBC get 10% reservation on the basis of the poverty criteria.The cut-off marks are the minimum qualifying score for a social bloc availing the reservations, and they vary across the categories of SC, ST, OBC, and EWS. In the Mains part of the CS-2023, the OBCs scored a cut-off of 712 as compared to 706 for the EWS. But in the Final, the OBCs trailed with a cut-off of 919 to the EWS which had 923 as the minimum marks.The Mains-Interview contrast is seen as surprising. Shashank Ratnoo, a lawyer who specialises in reservation laws and issues, said, ""There is no starkly noticeable reason for OBCs to have more marks in the Mains than EWS, yet lose out in the final cut off on account of EWS scoring better interview marks. It possibly shows that the EWS group has no or lesser social disadvantages that hurt competitiveness.""Interestingly, the contrast in the merit for OBCs and EWS in the Civil Services Examinations has been a see-saw. In the wake of the fresh EWS quotas introduced in 2019, the OBCs dominated the Mains and the Final both in 2019 and 2020. While it was surprising that EWS, which has groups with lower social handicaps, trailed behind the OBCs, it was viewed as result of the fact that a new quota regime had just come into effect and the facts about its procedures and criteria had not percolated down to the wider eligible umbrella. Later, the EWS overhauled the gap with OBCs and came to score higher in the examinations.According to Ratnoo, what is surprising is that EWS has notched a quicker rise in merit than possibly any social sub-group has done after coming under the reservation system. ""It is interesting that the Centre (DoPT) recently ordered an inquiry into the income certificates of some EWS candidates who were selected in the civil services after the Final exams. Such closer scrutiny may help understand the issue better. ""","The economically weaker sections (ews) have trailed the backward classes in the mains examinations of the civil services competition for the last two years.

Kerala Hit by Earliest Monsoon Since 2009 | IMD Predicts Above-Normal Rainfall for 2025

PUNE: The India Meteorological Department on Saturday issued a comprehensive rainfall warning of extremely heavy to very heavy rainfall (red and orange alerts) across several states over the next week. Heavy precipitation exceeding 200mm in 24 hours has been forecast for isolated areas in Madhya Pradesh on June 23, with Konkan, Goa, Madhya Maharashtra and Gujarat expected to experience heavy to very heavy rainfall till June 27.According to the forecast, northwest India is set to experience significant rainfall from June 21-27. Heavy showers are expected in Jammu-Kashmir-Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and east Rajasthan throughout the period. Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh are likely to receive heavy rainfall from June 21-26, with intense precipitation likely in UP till June 24. Delhi can expect heavy rainfall on June 22-23.Specifically, very heavy rainfall warnings have been issued for east Rajasthan (June 21-23), south Haryana and Punjab (June 22), and UP (June 22-23).IMD has forecast further southwest monsoon advancement into the remaining parts of J&K, Ladakh, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi over the next two days as conditions become increasingly favourable.""The monsoon is progressing towards northern states and is likely to advance to more parts, including Rajasthan and Uttarakhand, with some areas already covered. Delhi and other regions may be covered within the next two days through thunderstorms and monsoon activity,"" a senior IMD official told TOI.The weather department has also warned of the potential impact of heavy rainfall, including localised flooding, waterlogging and underpass closures in urban areas. Metropolitan cities may experience reduced visibility, traffic congestion and increased travel time because of waterlogged roads. Pune is expected to see increased rainfall activity from June 23, with light to moderate rain likely.On the specific weather systems driving this intense activity, the official said, ""There is a low-pressure area over the southwest Bihar region, which will move northwestward and gradually weaken by Sunday. But an associated cyclonic circulation is expected to move in a westward direction.""This system is expected to cause extremely heavy rainfall over Madhya Pradesh and adjoining regions on June 23, and heavy to very heavy rainfall activity at isolated places there till June 27.""Since this system is over land, areas under its influence are likely to experience significant impact.""The official said, ""Around June 25, a cyclonic circulation is likely to develop over Gangetic West Bengal and adjoining regions. We are expecting the westerlies, or monsoon winds, to strengthen over the west coast.""","Imd issues rainfall warning of extremely heavy to very heavy rainfall across several states over the next week.

NEW DELHI: The judges committee inquiring into the 'cash in kothi' case involving Justice Yashwant Varma spotted an ""unidentified person"" in a check shirt near the doused and half-burnt sacks of currency in the early hours of March 15 in one of the photos taken by first responders.This raises suspicion whether this man was responsible for removing the cash pile between 1am and 7am of said day in collaboration with Justice Varma's private secretary Rajinder Singh Karki and staffers Mohd Rahil, Babloo and Hanuman.The panel in its report said the photo ""shows a fireman standing at the entrance of the store with a torch and also making video, the debris as such at that point of time is stored at the back side of the store and there is also an unidentified man on the right side...""The committee comprising Punjab & Haryana chief justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Justice Anu Sivaraman said at the time of the fire incident at the storeroom, Justice Varma's daughter, ailing mother (who was not questioned by the panel), Karki and the 'trusted' servants were present at the 30, Tughlaq Crescent bungalow.As per the panel, all of them attempted to give misleading statements despite unimpeachable evidence about the presence of huge amounts of illegal cash in the judge's residence and continued to make bald denials when confronted with forensic laboratory authenticated electronic evidence and videos.Justice Varma's daughter was examined as Witness-54 as she was the sole family member (apart from Justice Varma's mother) present at home during the fire incident. Karki, Justice Varma's daughter and the three domestic staff denied seeing any burnt cash inside the storeroom, a stand the panel said is ""not liable to be accepted without a pinch of salt"".Giving details of how the domestic staff were recruited by Justice Varma and their long association with him, the panel surmised that it was not surprising to find them denying everything and contradicting themselves when confronted with evidence.The panel gave particular attention to Justice Varma's daughter's conduct during the fire incident on March 14 night and her statements during deposition. When she was shown the video of the burnt cash in the storeroom, ""there was a lame explanation by her that the said room could be any other room at a different location"", the panel said.It said she even refused to identify the voice of Karki clearly audible in the video. ""This goes to show that she is hiding the said fact since Karki himself had admitted that it is his voice,"" it said. Interestingly, Karki had told the panel that he came to know about the incident 6-7 days after the incident.","Judges committee spotted an ""unidentified person"" in a check shirt near the doused and half-burnt sacks of currency in one of the photos taken by first responders.

Sharing video footage of booth breaches voters' privacy: Election Commission,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-sharing-video-footage-of-booth-breaches-voters-privacy/articleshow/121998571.cms,"Representative Image

NEW DELHI: Election Commission officials on Saturday justified the recent amendment in Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, barring stakeholders other than itself from accessing poll-day webcasting feed from polling stations, unless an election petition was filed, saying that it was necessary to protect secrecy of voters and save them from possible intimidation.The poll-day CCTV footage or webcasting feed shall not be destroyed if an election petition (EP) is filed and shall be made available to the competent court when asked. However, where no EP is filed, such feed shall be disposed of in 45 days, it said. Slamming the move, LOP in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi said EC's decision is another evidence that the ""match is fixed"" - a charge he has levelled about the Maharashtra contest.Poll-day CCTV feed shall be disposed of in 45 days, in sync with the 45-day time-bar for filing election petitions, Election Commission recently ordered in its revised instructions dated May 30, 2025. EC sources warned that sharing poll-day videography/webcasting with any person, candidate, NGO or third party, without the express consent of the electors, ran the risk of identification of electors who voted or did not vote, from the footage, and their possible harassment and intimidation by anti-social elements.The officials insisted that the CCTV/webcasting feed from polling stations was only meant as an internal management tool and not mandated by the law.""What is veiled as a very logical demand to share video or CCTV footage of webcasting done at polling stations on poll day, is actually entirely contrary to the privacy and security concerns of the voters, which is a legal requirement under Representation of the People Act, 1950/1951 and in line with directions of the Supreme Court,"" an officer underlined.""Election Commission of India is legally bound and committed to protect the privacy of the electors and secrecy of voting, so video footage from polling station cannot be given to any person, candidate or NGO or any third party without the express consent of the elector(s),"" the official said and added that the profiling of voters vs non-voters may become the basis for discrimination, denial of services, intimidation and inducement.","The poll-day cctv footage or webcasting feed shall not be destroyed if an election petition (ep) is filed and shall be made available to the competent court when asked.

DIBRUGARH: Three veteran well control specialists from Cudd Well Control, US, began intensive site preparations on Saturday to bring under control a massive gas blowout of ONGC's Rudrasagar (RDS147A) rig in Assam's Sivasagar district.The experts, who flew in from Houston, arrived in Sivasagar on Friday after multiple attempts by ONGC's crisis management team failed to stop the leakage, which happened on June 12.The deployment of US team - experts in blowout control since 1977 - signals a critical escalation in efforts to contain the situation, which has already seen evacuation of 350 families from affected area, currently housed in relief camps.While ONGC has not yet officially confirmed whether the well will be permanently sealed, Assam CM, Himanta Biswa Sarma , on Friday said the corporation will ""permanently cap"" the well. ONGC's latest press release on Saturday, though, talked only about ""containment efforts"".""The experts have expressed their agreement with the strategy and execution carried out to date, reaffirming the effectiveness of ONGC's approach to safely managing the well,"" ONGC said in the statement.Based on a forward plan, jointly developed by US specialists and ONGC teams, extensive site preparations are underway to facilitate the next critical phase of containment operations.","Three veteran well control specialists from cudd well control, us, began intensive site preparations on saturday to bring under control a massive gas blowout.

SRINAGAR: National Conference president Farooq Abdullah blamed the ""dual power structure"" in the Union territory for the slow pace of development and warned that his party would move SC if statehood isn't restored soon. It is the first time NC has openly threatened legal action on restoration of statehood for Jammu & Kashmir.Abdullah said Saturday that people's expectations remain unmet due to the lack of full statehood despite formation of an elected govt in Oct 2024 - the first in J&K since 2018 and after region was carved into two UTs in 2019.""People hoped the new govt would address their demands, but the absence of statehood is a major obstacle,"" he said after a meeting with party delegates at Kokernag in south Kashmir's Anantnag district. ""How can we fulfil aspirations without statehood? Only with it can we have a full-fledged cabinet capable of addressing public issues effectively,"" he added.Abdullah said his party had launched an outreach campaign to make people aware of ""certain political forces ready to compromise their interests"". He added that after NC-led coalition's eight months in office, he remains hopeful about the return of statehood.""We have been waiting patiently. But if the delay continues, we will have little option but to approach Supreme Court.""The ""power struggle"" between National Conference-led elected govt and lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha has grown increasingly public. This month, cabinet ministers accused Sinha of interfering in administrative decisions reserved for govt.Sinha had pushed back. ""I have no authority over development departments. Governance is elected govt's responsibility. I only control police & can deploy them where needed. Roads, water, electricity, agriculture - all are under elected govt,"" he said.Peoples Conference president Sajad Lone backed the demand for statehood but criticised NC's record in office. ""UT status certainly limits development and is a humiliating existence. But whatever powers exist, NC govt has not utilised them. Instead, they've weaponised govt transfers and discriminated against constituencies they didn't win,"" Lone said.He also questioned the concentration of power in CMO. ""CM has 32 depts. Is it humanly possible to run 32 departments?"" Lone asked.","National conference president farooq abdullah blames the ""dual power structure"" in the union territory.

The ministry of education notified the committee on Friday, tasking it with resolving implementation issues and harmonising existing protocols to ensure a smooth transition. The committee is expected to submit its report within three weeks.With 18 members, the committee includes directors of leading institutions such as IIT-Bombay, IIM-Ahmedabad, School of Planning and Architecture, New Delhi, and VCs of Delhi University, Utkal University and SASTRA Deemed University, Thanjavur. Also on board are chairpersons of existing statutory bodies like the UGC, AICTE and NCTE.HECI was proposed under the National Education Policy 2020 as an overarching body to replace UGC and consolidate higher education regulation. It aims to bring all institutions under a single umbrella for academic standards, accreditation, and funding, while maintaining autonomy for domain-specific decisions through subject councils.However, the legislation to establish HECI has faced delays since its draft in 2018, with various iterations seeking to address concerns.The panel's terms of reference include addressing 'specific difficulties of HEIs to be brought under HECI's purview so that appropriate clarifications may be issued,' and analysing 'regulatory protocols of different statutory bodies and recommending applicable protocols for HEIs to become multidisciplinary institutions.' It is also tasked with proposing ' mechanisms in view of HECI' for funding and technical support systems, and to 'suggest organisational structure of Standards Councils,' while ensuring that statutory bodies continue to lay down academic standards and coordinate between teaching and research.","With 18 members, the committee includes directors of leading institutions.
