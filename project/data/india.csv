Watch: MPs Speak Out as SIR Row Dominates Winter Session Opening

WB roll deletions at 7.6%, Kol North tops with 26%

New Delhi: The draft electoral roll for West Bengal published on Tuesday, along with those for four other states/UTs under Phase 2 of special intensive revision (SIR) has 7.1 crore electors after 7.6% (58 lakh) of its 7.6-crore electorate as of Oct 29, 2025, was found to be dead, shifted/absent or enrolled at multiple places.Electoral registration officers (EROs) also found that 28 lakh enumeration forms were returned without mapping with the roll from the last SIR, while ‘logical discrepancies’ were found in forms submitted by 1.65 crore electors.This means around 1.9 crore electors in West Bengal will be issued notices by EROs, to explain the discrepancies and produce verifying documents. A hearing will be held to ascertain the elector’s whereabouts prior to the last SIR.Those who fail to satisfy the ERO will not make it to the final roll.These electors returned their forms with incomplete or incorrect details (the changed rule under SIR Phase 2 did away with the need to submit any documents).TOI has learnt that the ‘logical discrepancies’ include more than six progeny being linked to the same parent in the roll from last SIR, an elector aged more than 45 years who has never enrolled, ‘father name mismatch’, less than 15-year or over 50-year age difference with the parent, and less than 40-year age difference with the grandparent.Though the rate of deletions in West Bengal is 7.6% — comprising 3.2% dead electors, 4.3% shifted/absent and 0.18% enrolled at multiple places — the district-wise deletions ranged from a low of 3.3% in Purba Medinipur to 25.9% in Kolkata North and 23.8% in Kolkata South. Paschim Bardhaman saw 13.1% electors being struck off the district’s rolls.Significantly, the deletions in seven districts bordering Bangladesh are below the state average — only North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas reported higher deletions of 9.5%. However, the ‘father name mismatch’ rate in border districts is high: 15.9% in Malda, 15% in Uttar Dinajpur and 12.5% in Murshidabad. Even Darjeeling, bordering Nepal, has 13.8% ‘father name mismatch’ and Kalimpong, which adjoins Darjeeling, 19.9%.As for the other states/UTs where draft rolls were published on Tuesday, Rajasthan saw 41.8 lakh, or 7.6% of its 5.48-crore electorate as of Oct 29, being removed from the rolls. The deletions in both Goa and Puducherry were a little over 1 lakh; Puducherry saw the highest rate of exclusions at 10.1%, bringing down its electorate to 9.18 lakh from 10.2 lakh. Goa had 8.45% of its 11.8 lakh electors struck off the rolls, reducing its electorate to 10.8 lakh.In the small UT of Lakshadweep, around 2.47% of voters were found to be dead, shifted and duplicate electors, shrinking its electorate to 56,384 from 57,813.The list of dead, shifted/absent and duplicate voters has been shared with booth level agents (BLAs) of political parties and published on the CEO website and public offices. Claims and objections can be filed by the elector or BLAs till Jan 15, 2026. The notice phase, involving hearing and verification of eligibility documents, will continue up to Feb 7, 2026.The final roll for the five states/UTs will be published on Feb 14, 2026.","Wb roll deletions at 7.6%, kol north tops with 26% deletions. 28 lakh enumeration forms returned without mapping with the roll from last sir. ‘logical discrepancies’ include more than six progeny being linked to the same parent.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126028339,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-16696,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Gang members take undue advantage of jurisdiction issues: SC

New Delhi: Taking note of an increasingly familiar pattern of gangsters moving across jurisdictions in Delhi and its surroundings, Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Centre to consider enacting a legislation empowering a single agency to pursue organised crime syndicate members in Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR) states unhindered and produce them before a special court in Delhi, Noida, Faridabad or Gurgaon.“Why not a law to cater to the entire National Capital Region? Create exclusive special courts for central laws like UAPA, PMLA and NDPS Act in Delhi, Gurgaon or Noida, where the offences committed under the central laws would be tried irrespective of the location of the criminal incidents,” CJI Surya Kant told additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati.Taking stock of the progress made by the Centre and states towards constituting exclusive special courts to try offences probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi highlighted the modus operandi of gangsters who commit crime in one state and move to another to dodge arrest, delay trial, and take advantage of the delay to get bail.“If a gangster commits 10 offences in Haryana, five in Rajasthan and two in Delhi, the NIA can be asked to investigate which would trigger invocation of the special law to enable trial of the accused in one court in NCR,” Justice Bagchi elaborated.Bhati suggested that SC could take this issue up suo motu and provide a framework. The bench said it is a legislative exercise.In its order, the bench said, “In matters relating to grave offences under central penal laws, members of organised criminal gangs take undue advantage of jurisdictional issues in NCR.For prompt police action, there should be a competent court at one location where such gangsters are tried. In absence of this, hardened criminals get the benefit of bail due to delayed trials at different locations, which may not be in the interest of society and the public. .. It would be desirable that an effective law is enacted to deal with such situations for optimum utilisation of the legal architecture.”SC had earlier directed that no existing court should be designated as special court as these exclusive special courts should be vested with trials of NIA cases and not saddled with routine workload.Bhati informed SC that financial approval has been received from the Centre to the proposal to reimburse states Rs 1 crore each for recurring and non-recurring expenditures towards establishment of exclusive special courts to try NIA cases.Additional solicitor general S D Sanjay informed the court that the Delhi govt has decided to set up 16 exclusive special courts in three months for trial of cases under the central penal law.","Supreme court asks centre to consider enacting legislation to pursue organised crime syndicate members in delhi and ncr states unhindered.

Stop over-the-counter sale of SIM boxes: SC to authorities

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday said laxity by banks resulting in siphoning of money from people’s accounts due to cyber fraud , including digital arrests, counts as deficiency of service and emphasised that govt and regulators must devise a mechanism to ensure that an alarm goes off when scammers attempt to con account holders, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra .Referring to an earlier disclosure by one of the probe agencies that people have so far been conned to the tune of Rs 3,000 crore through digital arrests and cyber heists, a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said, “The staggering amount taken from people through digital arrest and cyber fraud is shocking. The banking system must have a mechanism to detect these laxities immediately when scamsters attempt to exploit it and raise a countrywide alarm.Attorney general R Venkataramani said, “There are obviously some gaps because of which such scams are taking place. We are putting our heads together to attempt plugging these loopholes.” He said various proposals are under consideration of an inter-departmental ministerial committee to create a robust mechanism to prevent cybercrimes like digital arrest.Amicus curiae and senior advocate N S Nappinai told the court that similar cyber crimes are prevalent in the United Kingdom but more than 90% of the money is recovered and restored to the persons who were cheated. She said the govt and probe agencies must focus on the recovery of the siphoned amount and restore it to the cheated account holders.SC Advocates-on-Record Association president Vipin Nair said SIM boxes, each containing 400 SIMs, continue to be sold over the counter enabling scamsters to use different numbers from the same device to con people. This should be stopped immediately, he pleaded.The bench on Dec 1 had flagged the rampant breach of norms in issuance of SIM cards and said, “Facts brought on record so far reveal an alarming negligent and irresponsible approach of telecom service providers while issuing multiple SIM cards in one name. We direct the department of telecom (DoT) to submit a proposal for the consideration of SC, which may eventually be required to be implemented to prevent misuse of SIM cards. ”Nair said despite the directions, no corrective or regulatory steps have been taken by the authorities. The CJI-led bench asked the authorities to immediately address the issue and take all measures to stop over-the-counter sale of SIM boxes. Venkataramani said the CBI, which was entrusted with the probe into digital arrest cases across the country, has made good progress. The bench asked the AG to place the probe status report in sealed cover. The bench said if the CBI needed additional directions for a seamless investigation into all cases, it could approach the court.","The supreme court said laxity by banks resulting in siphoning of money from people’s accounts due to cyber fraud counts as deficiency of service.

'Battleship Potemkin' and several other films land in troubled waters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/battleship-potemkin-and-several-other-films-land-in-troubled-waters/articleshow/126028211.cms,"Kerala Fest Claims Centre Refused Clearance; I&B Min Points To Norms

Thiruvananthapuram/New Delhi: The ongoing 30th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK) plunged into a crisis following the Centre's refusal to grant censor exemption certificates to several films, including Soviet auteur Sergei Eisenstein's black and white classic, 'Battleship Potemkin', leading to cancellations, uncertainty in scheduling and sharp political and artistic reactions.'Battleship Potemkin' was first released on Dec 21, 1925 and will celebrate its 100th birth anniversary this weekend.However, the Centre on Tuesday rejected allegations of selective denial saying the decision was based purely on procedural grounds. Ministry sources said 178 films were granted exemption out of 187 applications received, adding that the organisers applied for exemption on Dec 3, whereas guidelines require applications to be submitted at least 15 days before the start of a festival.The 30th edition of IFFK began on Dec 12 and will continue till Dec 19.According to organisers, screening permission was denied to some films as they did not have the mandatory censor exemption certificate issued by the Union ministry of information and broadcasting. As a result, seven screenings scheduled over the past two days were cancelled. Organisers warned that the situation could worsen, with up to eight more screenings facing the risk of cancellation if clearances were not received in time.The delay or denial of these exemptions triggered the current impasse, leaving organisers legally barred from proceeding with the screenings, even for internationally acclaimed works.'Battleship Potemkin', 74 minutes long, invariably figures in every list of ""Greatest Films of All time"". The film dramatised the Potemkin crew's real-life mutiny against its officers in 1905 Czarist Russia. Over the decades, the film's 'Odessa Steps' sequence became part of every cinema syllabus for both cinematographers and editors.Apart from Eisenstein's film, several other high-profile movies were initially refused permission. Three films under the Palestine package, including 'Palestine 36', were also denied permission, raising concerns over selective clearances. 'Palestine 36', however, was screened during the opening ceremony as organisers said they had not received the list of restricted films at that time.The state govt said later that the Centre on Tuesday granted clearance to four more films: 'Beef', 'Once Upon A Time In Gaza', 'Eagles of the Republic' and 'Heart of the Wolf'.Veteran filmmaker Adoor Gopalakrishnan said denying films permission based on titles or perceived themes undermined artistic freedom and the very spirit of international film festivals.CPM general secretary M A Baby alleged that the Centre was deliberately attempting to sabotage the festival, accusing it of interfering in cultural spaces. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor intervened in the matter, seeking an early resolution to prevent further disruption to the festival.Meanwhile, Kerala's cultural affairs minister Saji Cherian directed the State Chalachitra Academy to ensure that none of the selected films were dropped and asserted that all films would be screened in accordance with the original schedule.","Kerala fest claims centre refused clearance; i&b min points to norms.

SC takes up plea of cash row judge; seeks parliament reply,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-takes-up-plea-of-cash-row-judge-seeks-parl-reply/articleshow/126027604.cms,".

New Delhi: Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to examine Allahabad high court judge Justice Yashwant Varma's plea challenging validity of Lok Sabha speaker's decision to constitute a three-member committee for his impeachment initiated in the aftermath of the discovery of unaccounted cash currencies at his official residence. It issued notices to Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha secretariats.The HC judge pointed out a procedural lapse on the part of the speaker to constitute a three-member committee against him. Appearing before a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and A G Masih, former attorney general Mukul Rohatgi submitted that despite impeachment notices being moved both in the LS and RS, the speaker proceeded to constitute the committee on his own, without waiting for the Rajya Sabha chairman's decision on admission of the motion or holding the mandatory joint consultation.Referring to The Judges (Inquiry) Act, Rohatgi said the committee has to be constituted jointly by the speaker and the chairman when notices of an impeachment motion are given to both the Houses on the same day.As per the Act, ""Where notices of a motion (for the removal of a Judge) referred to in sub-section (1) are given on the same day in both Houses of Parliament, no committee shall be constituted unless the motion has been admitted in both Houses and where such motion has been admitted in both Houses, the committee shall be constituted jointly by the speaker and the chairman"".It also said where notices of a motion are given in the Houses of Parliament on different dates, the notice which is given later shall stand rejected. The bench, after going through the provision, observed why this point was not raised by legal experts who are members of Parliament. ""So many MPs and legal experts but no one pointed this out?"" SC said.The judge in his petition filed through advocate Vaibhav Niti, said the speaker acted in clear derogation of the proviso to Section 3(2) of the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, by unilaterally constituting a committee on Aug 12 after admitting a motion given before LS on July 21 as on the very same day a separate motion was given in RS which had not been admitted.""In brief, the above action and all consequential actions are impugned as being contrary to the peremptory prescription contained in the first proviso to Section 3(2) Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968 because although notices of motion under Section 3(1) of the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968 were given in both Houses of Parliament on the same day, the speaker constituted the committee unilaterally without awaiting admission of the motion by the chairman and the joint consultation with the chairman as contemplated in that statute,"" it said.MPs gave separate motions before LS and RS on July 27, seeking removal of the petitioner as a judge. Both motions met the statutory numerical requirement.Thereafter, on Aug 12 the speaker said he was admitting the motion given before him and constituting a three-member committee as envisaged under the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968 to conduct the statutory inquiry.",Allahabad high court judge justice yashwant varma's plea challenging validity of lok sabha speaker's decision to constitute a three-member committee for his impeachment initiated in the aftermath of the discovery of unaccounted cash currencies at his official residence.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126027672,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-18320,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Everything Fine, Says Shashi Tharoor After Skipping Congress Rally Amid Growing Speculation of Rift

NEW DELHI: Congress on Tuesday protested both inside and outside Parliament against the ""anti-people"" G RAM G bill, with its MP Shashi Tharoor - who the party has accused of being soft on BJP - taking a dig at the governmentt in Lok Sabha by recalling an old Bollywood number - ""dekho o deewano (tum) ye kaam na karo, Ram ka naam badnam na karo"".Sounding the bugle of ""sansad to sadak"" fight against the rural employment gurantee bill, Congress's Rahul Gandhi alleged that PM Narendra Modi wants to target the secure livelihood of the poor after destroying the future of India's youth through massive unemployment. He said saddling states with 40% financial burden will destroy the foundational principles of the job guarantee scheme - right to work, full central support for wages and 3/4th for material costs and autonomy to villages to decide development works.The prime minister has ""deep dislike"" for the rights of the poor, and MGNREGA is a living embodiment of Gandhi's vision of 'gram swaraj' as a lifeline for crores of rural Indians, Rahul said.""To remove the name of Mahatma Gandhi is to strip the bill of its moral compass and historical legitimacy,"" Tharoor said in Lok Sabha.","Congress mp shashi tharoor takes a dig at the governmentt in lok sabha.

AQI Severe-Plus, Delhi’s Worst In More Than 1 Yr

Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

NEW DELHI: A dense blanket of fog enveloped Delhi-NCR on Monday morning, severely reducing visibility across roads and disrupting normal movement, while the region continued to grapple with toxic air quality in the ‘severe-plus’ category. The deteriorating weather and pollution conditions also impacted air travel, prompting IndiGo Airlines to issue a travel advisory warning passengers of possible delays and urging them to plan their journeys with extra caution.Amid changing weather conditions, IndiGo Airlines on Monday issued a travel advisory for passengers as Delhi witnessed the first signs of winter fog this season, impacting visibility at the airport.In its advisory, the airline said visibility levels around the airport were currently reduced, and as a result, flight operations were being adjusted, with some departures likely to take longer than usual. IndiGo assured passengers that its teams remain available to provide support, acknowledging that travel plans, schedules, and connections are important.The airline also cautioned that road traffic could be slower due to foggy conditions and advised passengers to plan their journeys accordingly and allow additional time to reach the airport.IndiGo said it is closely monitoring the situation and will keep passengers informed, adding that departures will continue as conditions improve, with safety remaining the top priority.Similarly Air India issued a travel advisory for passengers; it said, ""Poor visibility due to dense fog is impacting flight operations in Delhi and parts of Northern India. Please check your flight status at: http://airindia.com/in/en/manage/flight-status.html before heading to the airport.""Earlier on Sunday, Delhiites could literally see poison in the air. A thick layer of toxic smog enveloped the capital, turning the city into a gas chamber with air quality plunging to 'severe-plus' category for the first time this year.The city's 24-hour average air quality index stood at 461, the second-worst recorded in Dec and the worst in nearly 13 months. Since the scale began in April 2015, only once has a higher AQI been recorded in Dec - 469 on Dec 21, 2017. For any month, the last time Delhiites a suffered worst AQI was on Nov 18 last year (494).High moisture, low temperatures and calm winds effectively trapped pollution close to the surface even as a grey smog screened out the sun for most of the day. Winds are predicted to pick up slightly post-noon on Monday, which could disperse some pollutants.On Sunday, atmospheric ‘inversion’ made the situation worse. This occurs when cooler air near the ground gets trapped under warmer air above, stopping pollutants from dispersing. Though meteorological conditions remained unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants, local emissions continued to remain high.“This is a true depiction of Delhi’s local emissions because wind speeds are almost zero, meaning there is hardly any inflow or outflow of air. Vertical ventilation is confined to a column of just 600 metres, which means whatever remains in the box — Delhi — is largely its own emissions. Under these conditions, the contribution of dust is negligible. When dust is released from construction activity, it usually spreads to other areas due to wind, but with winds nearly calm, it cannot pollute places beyond the immediate site of release,” said Gufran Beig, founder of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) and Chair Professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS).Of the total 39 active air quality monitoring stations, 38 saw ‘severe’ AQI while only Shadipur was placed in the ‘very poor’ category at 375. Of these, three stations — Wazirpur, Rohini and Ashok Vihar — maxed out at 500, while several others reported AQI above 490.This is the second spell of severe air days in Delhi this season. The city had recorded three consecutive severe days from Nov 11 to 13. In this winter season, the city has recorded five such days, when AQI surpassed 400.After air quality started rapidly deteriorating on Saturday, the Graded Response Action Plan’s stage III was imposed in the morning. Stage IV was invoked on Saturday evening as AQI showed no sign of improvement. Currently, all stages of GRAP are in force.Delhi’s highest-ever AQI of 497 was recorded on Nov 6, 2016. The second-worst air quality day followed on Nov 18 last year with AQI reaching 494.Experts said since winds are likely to rise only marginally post-noon, no significant respite from toxic air quality is expected on Monday. However, the Centre’s Air Quality Early Warning System (EWS) stated that the AQI may dip to ‘very poor’ on Monday. “Delhi’s air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ category from Dec 15 till 17. The outlook for the subsequent six days from Dec 18 is that AQI is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ category,” said the EWS.The CPCB classifies AQI 050 as 'good', 51-100 as 'satisfactory', 101-200 as 'moderate', 201300 as 'poor', 301-400 as 'very poor', 401-450 as 'severe', and 451 and above as ‘severe plus.’ Meanwhile, the lowest visibility on Sunday morning was recorded at 200 metres at Safdarjung. It was 350 metres at Palam. “Safdarjung reported 300 metres at 5.30am but calm winds further reduced the visibility to 200 metres at 8am,” said a Met official.India Meteorological Department measures fog in terms of visibility. Visibility between 500-1,000 metres is considered ‘shallow’ fog. Fog is 'moderate' when visibility is between 200-500 metres, and ‘dense’ below 200 metres.The maximum temperature was recorded at 24 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. The minimum stood at 8.2 degrees C. IMD has predicted shallow to moderate fog in the early hours of Monday.","A dense blanket of fog enveloped delhi-ncr on monday morning, severely reducing visibility across roads and disrupting normal movement.

'Delhi NOT Most Polluted': Doctor's Shocking Reveal On Toxic Monster; And How To Fight Back

NEW DELHI: Delhi environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa on Tuesday said it was unrealistic to expect any elected government to bring down air pollution within a short period, as the Delhi-NCR continued to struggle with severe smog conditions, with air quality ranging from poor to severe, raising serious health concerns for residents.""It is impossible for any elected government to reduce AQI in 9-10 months. I apologise for the pollution in Delhi. We are doing better work than the dishonest AAP government, and we have reduced AQI each day. This disease of pollution is given to us by the Aam Aadmi Party, and we are working to fix it,"" Sirsa said.Sirsa announced additional measures to curb pollution, saying that from Thursday, only BS-VI vehicles from outside Delhi will be permitted to enter the national capital.He also said that vehicle owners without a valid Pollution Under Control Certificate (PUCC) will be denied fuel at petrol pumps starting Thursday.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), several areas including Anand Vihar, AIIMS, Ghazipur and India Gate reported very poor to severe air quality. Anand Vihar and Ghazipur recorded an AQI of 410 each, categorised as ‘severe’, while AIIMS stood at 397 and India Gate at 380, both in the ‘very poor’ category.With pollution levels exceeding critical limits, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) invoked all measures under Stage-IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi-NCR. Stage-IV is the strictest level of restrictions, applied when AQI exceeds 450, and is aimed at reducing public exposure and preventing further deterioration of air quality.Last week, Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta had also addressed protests over rising pollution levels, saying the crisis was the result of years of neglect and would take time to resolve. Speaking at an event in Pitampura, she said the government needed sufficient time to deal with the long-standing problem.""Those who make big statements and protest at India Gate… pollution is not something that appeared today, it has been a problem for years.What did the previous government do? Where were you at that time? This is a backlog of 27 years. The government needs at least 27 months to clear the backlog of 27 years,"" Gupta said.","Delhi environment minister manjinder singh sirsa said it was unrealistic to expect any elected government to bring down air pollution within a short period.

Lakhpati Didis: How India’s SHG women are transforming lives - And politics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lakhpati-didis-how-indias-shg-women-are-transforming-lives-and-politics/articleshow/126005504.cms,"Lakhpati Didi Scheme: PM Modi Empowers Over 20 Lakh Women in Bihar with Cash Support Ahead of Polls

What is a Lakhpati Didi - And where did It come from?



How self-help groups work on the ground



Under DAY-NRLM, SHGs receive:

Revolving funds (Rs 20,000–Rs 30,000 per group, of their own saving),

Community investment funds (up to Rs 2.5 lakh),

Bank linkages (Financial inclusion is a key component to make SHG members preferred clients of the banking system, which in turn helps in)

Collateral-free bank loans up to Rs 20 lakh with interest subvention and overdraft facilities.

Scale and impact - By the numbers



Why they matter beyond economics



The election lens: Why SHG women are politically significant



How political parties view them



Over the past few decades, women’s participation in India’s rural economy has moved from the margins to the centre of policy conversations. From savings collectives and micro-enterprises to agriculture, dairy and small manufacturing, women - particularly in hinterlands - are increasingly being seen not merely as beneficiaries of welfare, but as economic agents capable of driving household incomes and local growth.When Shashibala Sonkar from a small town in Mirzapur, UP, first joined a self-help group (SHG) five years ago, she saw it as a way to make a little money to ease her financial troubles and access small loans. This year, she crossed a milestone that officially changed her life: her household income surpassed Rs1 lakh a year, qualifying her as a Lakhpati Didi - one among millions of rural women recognised by the Centre as economic contributors and community inspirations.“Our finances were not strong. I used to look for some or other work through which I could support my family. I used to do tailoring and knitting, then I joined the samooh (SHG) and things changed” said Shashibala in conversation with TOI.Her story reflects a shift in rural India’s socio-economic landscape. This shift in thinking has found formal expression in the government’s push to strengthen and scale self-help groups (SHGs), which today form one of the largest women-led grassroots economic networks in the world.With millions of women organised into savings and credit collectives, the focus has gradually moved beyond subsistence livelihoods towards income sustainability and entrepreneurship. And this shift is also increasingly becoming a political battleground.The term Lakhpati Didi refers to a member of a self-help group whose annual household income exceeds Rs 1 lakh, sustained over at least four agricultural or business cycles, with a monthly average above Rs 10,000. These women are recognised not just for income, but for adopting sustainable livelihood practices and managing resources effectively.The idea was centrally promoted by the Union government in 2023 on Independence Day, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi described his vision of making “two crore Lakhpati Didis in villages”, highlighting the role of SHG women in the rural economy.This target was taken forward with formalisation in the Budget 2024, where finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman raised the scheme’s ambition from two crore to three crore Lakhpati Didis. The initiative builds on the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), launched under the ministry of rural development. This is itself the evolved form of India’s long-standing SHG network, which traces its institutional history to 1992’s NABARD SHG-Bank Linkage Programme and gained scale under NRLM from 2011 onwards.An SHG typically comprises 10-20 rural women who save small amounts collectively, access credit, and then invest in income-generating activities. These range from dairy and agriculture to services and small enterprises. Over time, the groups federate into larger bodies for better access to training, finance and markets.Shashibala told TOI, in 2021 she along with some other women of the community established ‘Om Sai Ajivika Mahila Swayam Sahayata Samooh’ which has been “transformative and helpful’ for her and all the other women associated with the group. Currently she is the only one from the group to be recognised as Lakhpati Didi.She says, “the journey which began five years ago has been slow, steady, but sustainable.”The system has helped organise nearly 9–10 crore women into over 90 lakh SHGs nationwide as of mid-2025.These funds form the very backbone on which the initiatives by SHG sustain themselves. Shashibala has established a Namkeen manufacturing unit in her town with the help of funds acquired through the SHG. According to her, who also holds a senior position in the group, the loans “aren’t that difficult to get” when compared to usual bank loans which require collateral, guarantees and a lengthier process.“When we started the group I decided I needed something sustainable and even my son was planning for business so we went for namkeen business. But the problem was the finances, you can ask relatives for help but then after everything they’ll offer what a few thousands that’s not enough,” she told TOI.She further added, “I initially took a loan of Rs 2 lakh from CCL (joint account of position holders in group), it wasn’t that difficult to get it, probably due to SGH, and further some help through ‘Gram Sanghatans’ which work in association with self-help groups.”She also tells us that although getting loans through group wasn't a task, it was comparatively when she required more capital and her son applied for a loan under PMEGP (PM employment generation program). But, it became “easier” when she became a guarantor in the application and eventually acquired a Rs 10 lakh loan.In many states, SHG groups have diversified beyond savings and credit into local manufacturing, services and even tech-related work.For instance, Sita Devi from a small village in Karnal, Haryana, after enrolling under NRLM, she underwent FL-CRP training and completed her graduation. She later received drone pilot training in Gurgaon. On completing the course, she was provided a drone, which now forms the backbone of her livelihood. She undertakes agricultural tasks such as fertiliser spraying and crop monitoring.SHGs have been mobilised for campaigns like Har Ghar Tiranga - stitching tricolour flags linked to rural livelihoods - demonstrating their reach into community life.The latest official figures show a sharp rise in women achieving Lakhpati Didi status. By late 2025, over 2 crore women had crossed the Rs 1 lakh household income threshold, spanning thousands of self-help groups across states. Shashibala said, “there are people from ‘Development alternative’ (people from government) who work in coordination with SGH, they look into and facilitate initiatives, make regular regulatory visits and they this year in their August audit decided to recognise her as Lakhpati Didi.”Earlier this year on Independence Day when PM Narendra Modi from the rampart of Red Fort acknowledged the contribution of Lakhpati Didis to the economy and women empowerment, Shashibala was among the 15 Lakhpati Didis sitting in the audience gallery.She was also given the certificate of recognition by the UP deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya in an event to felicitate the newly recognised Lakpati Didis in August.Individual states have also pushed their own efforts: Uttar Pradesh recorded over 17.09 lakh Lakhpati Didis, with investments in revolving funds, bank loans and sector-specific linkages like integrated farming, dairy, sericulture and producer groups. Meanwhile Gujarat reported nearly 5.96 lakh Lakhpati Didis, backed by over Rs 1,400 crore in funds and Rs 3,600 crore in credit to SHGs.SHGs - and by extension Lakhpati Didis - are more than income networks. They serve as conduits for financial literacy, skill development, collective action, social support and opinion making. The government’s own notes describe them as fostering inclusion and entrepreneurship, not just subsistence livelihoods.As in the case of Shahsibala, there is now always a perpetual beeline of media, organisations and people inviting her to events, and ceremonies. She now has become an inspiration for many women, more recently Gates Foundation is working on a series with her, focusing on empowering women, and bolstering the reach and development work of the self-help group network.Researchers also point to the vital roles SHG women played during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, where they took up mask production, sanitiser making and community outreach, illustrating their importance in local resilience.The tight knit network and personal equations provides these women from humble backgrounds a sworn credibility and a standing in local communities, much more than average political party or leader. This has helped these women to emerge as a new brand of influencers - which work probably on a more reliable, traditional word of mouth.As a long-term development project, SHGs are not new. But what has changed in recent years - and become politically salient - is the scale Lakhpati Didi has gained political visibility at a time when rural women’s votes - particularly in swing regions - matter decisively.In the 2024 Lok Sabha election, parties across the spectrum sought to court women voters with tailored promises, from direct cash transfers to livelihood programmes. While Lakhpati Didi itself was not an election manifesto pledge per se, its enhancement in Budget 2024, including the decision to raise the target from two crore to three crore women - presented mid-election year - added a political dimension to it.Political analysts note that SHG women represent a large, organised and socially influential constituency, particularly in states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh, where rural votes often decide tight contests. Unlike cash-transfer beneficiaries, SHG members are embedded in community networks, making programme performance - timely credit, training quality, market access - a subject of collective discussion at the village level.For the ruling party, showcasing Lakhpati Didis aligns with broader narratives of Aatmanirbhar Bharat and women’s empowerment. Opposition parties, while supportive of women’s economic opportunities, have raised questions about implementation gaps, inclusion errors, and whether benefits reach the poorest households.In several states, opposition leaders have challenged governments on delayed payments, limited access to training, or insufficient infrastructure support - common electoral talking points in rural constituencies. These debates intensify in assembly polls, where the award or denial of a programme’s benefits can shift local votes.Election strategists have pointed out that in close contests, SHG-linked livelihoods can influence voting behaviour not through direct transfers, but through perceived economic stability and dignity of work. The continuation - or disruption - of livelihood support can shape local political loyalties, particularly among women voters who have traditionally been less courted through income-focused programmes.The BJP has regularly highlighted Lakhpati Didi milestones in public events and state tours, framing them as achievements of its governance model. Government events such as Lakhpati Didi Sammelans - where certificates are handed over to newly certified women - are often attended by senior leaders to underline the scheme’s reach.Regional and opposition parties have sometimes echoed similar goals, advocating for rural women’s empowerment as part of their platforms. However, where the ruling coalition touts numerical targets and credit support, critics focus on on-ground gaps - such as whether infrastructure, market access and sustainable demand truly follow the initial income gains.Election pundits explain that such programmes serve not just as welfare tools but as voter engagement levers: assured income gains, community status and local group networks can translate into political loyalty or voting preferences, especially in marginal seats.The recently concluded Bihar elections have put the political significance of these women to the fore. Reports have also highlighted that these women were tasked with ensuring at least 80 per cent women voting at every booth they were provided with electors and were under constant monitoring. They were used as community mobilisers to reach out to women multiple times a day, and encourage them to go out and vote. These women were also instrumental in taking the Rs 10,000 financial aid announced for women months before elections to their communities.The Election Commission itself used the network of Didis for spreading electoral awareness, for identifying Burqha-clad women at booths. More than 1,80,000 women were deployed on booths throughout the state in both phases of elections.In this background it becomes even important to acknowledge that Bihar saw a massive jump of 8.8 per cent more women voting in comparison to men.Opposition from RJD to Congress have questioned the use of Didis in the electoral process. Political analysts pointed out the possible conflict of interest, as to the very beneficiaries of the government's financial aid were used for handling polling-related duties and for voter awareness.In conclusion, with a national target of three crore Lakhpati Didis, the scale of ambition is enormous. Achieving it will require deepening credit linkages, enhancing digital infrastructure, strengthening market networks, and ensuring equitable inclusion of marginalised communities.Politically, as India moves for next election cycle through state elections, Lakhpati Didi is likely to remain a reference point in debates on rural development and women’s economic participation. Whether it endures as a transformative livelihood model or becomes another contested policy marker will depend on how effectively income gains are sustained beyond targets - and beyond election seasons.But one fact is determined, as we live in the times of influencer marketing these women have emerged as the newest addition to that brand of influencers and as a political constituency which no party can afford to ignore.","Lakhpati didi scheme: pm modi empowers over 20 lakh women in bihar with cash support ahead of polls.

Arrested at Delhi airport after deportation



Charged with culpable homicide and negligence



What has happened so far?



Fled hours after fire



Detained in Thailand, shifted to immigration centre



Delhi court rejected anticipatory bail pleas



Extradition treaty enabled swift deportation



HC converts civil suit into PIL







Case registered under BNS



NEW DELHI: The owners of Goa’s Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, Gaurav Luthra (44) and Saurabh Luthra (40), where a massive fire on December 6 claimed 25 lives, were taken into custody by the Goa Police on Tuesday.The Luthra brothers landed at Delhi’s IGI airport earlier in the day after being deported to India on “emergency certificates” following the extradition process.Investigators alleged that the two fled India within hours of the incident in an attempt to abscond after the tragedy.A Delhi court later granted a 48-hour transit remand to the Goa Police, following which the accused brothers were taken for medical examination as part of standard legal procedure.The Goa police formally arrested the Delhi-based brothers at the immigration control of Indira Gandhi International Airport on Tuesday after they landed in the national capital.They arrived on an IndiGo flight in the afternoon, wearing masks and surrounded by immigration security officials, and were immediately handed over to authorities for further legal proceedings.The Luthra brothers are facing charges of culpable homicide and negligence in connection with the December 6 blaze at their nightclub in Arpora, North Goa.Investigators alleged that the tragedy was compounded by serious violations of mandatory fire safety norms by the management, raising questions about regulatory lapses and accountability.According to investigators, Gaurav and Saurabh Luthra fled to Phuket in the early hours of December 7, just hours after the fire. Authorities subsequently cancelled their passports and issued an Interpol Blue Corner Notice to trace their movement.The duo was detained by Thai authorities on December 11 from Hotel Indigo Phuket’s Patong area following a request from the Union government. They were later shifted to an immigration detention centre in Bangkok as India coordinated with Thailand for their deportation under existing legal frameworks.On December 11, a Delhi court rejected the brothers’ transit anticipatory bail pleas. Additional sessions Judge Vandana termed the allegations “prima facie grave and serious” and sharply criticised the conduct of the accused.The court also noted that the brothers had booked tickets to Phuket just one hour after the fire, a fact their counsel had allegedly concealed while seeking protection from arrest.The judge observed that leaving the country immediately after the tragedy was a clear attempt to “evade the legal process”.An extradition treaty between India and Thailand has been in force since 2015. Thai officials said due process was followed as part of cooperation between the two countries, leading to the lawful and prompt deportation of the accused.Observing that “someone has to be held accountable” for the tragedy, a Goa bench of the Bombay high court on Monday converted a civil suit against the nightclub into a public interest litigation, underscoring the seriousness of the incident.The Goa Police registered a criminal case on December 7 at the Arpora Anjuna Police Station under Sections 105, 125, 125(a), 125(b) and 287, read with Section 3(5) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023.The fire broke out late on December 6 during a crowded event at the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, killing 25 people, including five tourists and 20 staff members. A magisterial inquiry was ordered to determine the cause of the fire and fix responsibility for the lapses that led to the deadly incident.","Gaurav and saurabh luthra are facing charges of culpable homicide and negligence in connection with the december 6 blaze at their nightclub in arpora, north goa.

MGNREGA to be replaced with VB–G Ram G: What it is and how it’s different — key FAQs answered,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mgnrega-is-now-vbg-ram-g-what-it-is-and-how-its-different-key-faqs-answered/articleshow/125975849.cms,"End Of MGNREGA? What VB–G Ram G Means For Rural Workers, Farmers And Viksit Bharat Plan

Here are some of the frequently asked questions:

What is VB–G RAM G?

Water security through water-related works

Core-rural infrastructure

Livelihood-related infrastructure

Special works to mitigate extreme weather events

.

How is the new act different from MGNREGA? What makes it better?



Higher Employment Guarantee: Guarantee increases from 100 → 125 days, giving rural households higher income security.

Strategic Infrastructure Focus: MGNREGA works were scattered across many categories without a robust national strategy.

Localised, Spatially Integrated Planning: The new Act mandates Viksit Gram Panchayat Plans, prepared by panchayats themselves and integrated with national spatial systems like PM Gati-Shakti.

The new Act focuses on 4 major types of works ensuring durable assets that directly support water security, core rural infrastructure, livelihood-related infrastructure creation and climate adaptation

How will the new scheme benefit the rural economy?

Water Security: Water-related works are prioritised. Mission Amrit Sarovar has already created/rejuvenated 68,000+ water bodies, demonstrating clear agricultural and groundwater impact.

Core Rural Infrastructure: Roads, connectivity and foundational infrastructure boost market access and rural business activity.

Livelihood Infrastructure: Storage, markets, and production assets support income diversification.

Climate Resilience: Infrastructure for water harvesting, flood drainage, and soil conservation protects rural livelihoods.

Higher Employment & Consumption: 125 guaranteed days increase household earnings, stimulating the village economy.

Reduced Distress Migration: With more rural opportunities and durable assets, migration pressures fall.

Digital Formalisation: Digital attendance, digital payments and data-driven planning increase efficiency.

How will the new scheme benefit farmers?

Guaranteed Labour Availability: States may notify periods aggregating up to 60 days during peak sowing/harvesting when MGNREGA work stops. This prevents labour shortages during critical farm operations and avoids labour being diverted away to guaranteed-wage worksites.

Preventing Wage Inflation: Stopping public works during peaks prevents artificial wage inflation that raises food production costs.

Water & Irrigation Assets: Prioritised water works improve irrigation, groundwater and multi-season cropping potential (supported by the 68,000+ Amrit Sarovar water bodies achievement).

Better Connectivity & Storage: Core and livelihood infrastructure helps farmers store produce, reduce losses, and access markets.

Climate Resilience: Flood-drainage, water harvesting and soil conservation protect crops and reduce damage.

How will the new scheme benefit labourers?

Higher Income: 125 guaranteed days = 25% more potential earnings.

Predictable Work: Hyperlocal Viksit Gram Panchayat Plans ensure planned, advance-mapped work availability.

Digital Payments & Protection: Electronic wages (already 99.94% in 2024-25) continue with full biometric and Aadhaar-based verification, eliminating wage theft.

Unemployment Allowance: If work is not given, states must pay unemployment allowance.

Asset Creation Benefits Workers Too: Workers build and benefit from improved roads, water, and livelihood assets.

Why is there a need to change MGNREGA now?

MGNREGA was built for 2005, but rural India has transformed.

Poverty fell sharply from 25.7% (2011–12) to 4.86% (2023–24), supported by rising consumption, incomes and financial access recorded in MPCE and NABARD RECSS surveys.

With stronger social protection, better connectivity, deeper digital access and more diverse rural livelihoods, the old framework no longer matched today’s rural economy.

Given this structural change, MGNREGA’s open-ended model had become outdated.

The Viksit Bharat – Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin): VB – G RAM G (विकसित भारत – जी राम जी) Bill modernises the system, raising guaranteed days, refocusing priorities, and building a more accountable, targeted, and relevant employment framework for today’s rural economy.

Why shift from demand-based to normative funding?

Normative funding aligns MGNREGA with the budgeting model used for most Government of India schemes, without reducing the employment guarantee.

A demand-based model leads to unpredictable allocations and mismatched budgeting. Normative funding uses objective parameters, ensuring predictable, rational planning while still guaranteeing that every eligible worker receives employment or unemployment allowance.

Does normative funding weaken the guarantee of 125 days?

Forecasting accuracy shown by FY 2024-25 when allocation matched demand perfectly

States + Centre share responsibility

Special relaxations allowed during disasters

If work is not provided, the unemployment allowance is mandatory

Thus, the right to guaranteed employment remains legally protected.

Were no attempts made to improve MNREGA earlier?



Women’s participation: 48% → 56.74%

Aadhaar-seeded active workers: 76 lakhs → 12.11crore

Workers on APBS: 0 → 11.93crore

Geo-tagged assets: 0 → 6.44 crore+

e-payments: 37% → 99.99%

Individual assets: 17.6% → 62.96%

What were the problems with MNREGA that necessitated a change?

Investigations in 19 districts of West Bengal found non-existent works, rule violations, and fund misuse, leading to a freeze.

Monitoring across 23 states in FY 2025–26 revealed works “not found or not commensurate with expenditure,” machine use where labour was required, and large-scale bypassing of NMMS attendance.

In 2024–25, misappropriation totalled ₹193.67 crore across states. Only 7.61% of households completed 100 days in the post-pandemic period.

These entrenched issues such as leakages, weak verification, and poor compliance required a new framework, not minor tweaks. The GRG Act creates a clean, digitally governed, accountable, and infrastructure-focused system.

What transparency and social protection measures are built into new Act?

AI-based fraud detection

Central + State Steering Committees for oversight

Focus on 4 key verticals for rural development

Enhanced monitoring role for Panchayats

GPS/mobile-based monitoring

real-time MIS dashboards

weekly public disclosures

stronger social audits (twice a year for every GP)

Why shift from a central sector to a centrally sponsored scheme?



States now share cost & responsibility

Better incentives to prevent misuse

Plans tailored to regional conditions through Gram Panchayat Plans

Centre retains standards, while states execute with accountability

This partnership model improves efficiency and reduces misuse.

Will this burden states financially?

Standard ratio: 60:40 (Centre: State)

North-east & Himalayan states/UT: 90:10

UTs without legislature: 100% funded by Central Funds

States already paid 25% materials & 50% admin earlier

Predictable normative allocation aids budgeting

States can request extra support during disasters

Better oversight reduces long-term losses from misappropriation

Why is a 60-day no-work period mandated, and what happens to workers then?

It ensures labour availability during sowing/harvest

Prevents sharp wage inflation that raises food prices

Workers naturally shift to agriculture, which pays higher seasonal wages

60 days is aggregated, not continuous

Workers still get 125 guaranteed days in the remaining ~300 days

Thus, farmers and labourers both benefit.

NEW DELHI: Centre is set to introduce a new rural employment law in the Lok Sabha, proposing to repeal the two-decade-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) with another legislation, titled the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB–G RAM G) Bill, 2025.The bill seeks to replace the MGNREGA with a revamped framework aimed at aligning rural employment and development with the national vision of Viksit Bharat 2047. It has been listed in the supplementary list of businesses issued on Monday.The Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act, 2025 represents a major overhaul of MNREGA. Under the proposed law, the government ""establishes a modern statutory framework aligned with Viksit Bharat 2047, guaranteeing 125 days of wage employment per rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work,"" as per a statement released.The Act aims to create both employment and durable rural infrastructure through four priority verticals:All assets created under the scheme will be consolidated into the Viksit Bharat National Rural Infrastructure Stack, aimed at ""ensuring a unified and coordinated national approach to rural development,"" it said.The new Act represents a major upgrade over MGNREGA, fixing structural weaknesses while enhancing employment, transparency, planning, and accountability.Key improvements include:The Act strengthens the rural economy through productive asset creation, higher incomes, and better resilience:Also read: Rural jobs scheme: MGNREGA to be replaced by VB–G Ram G; Congress asks why remove Mahatma Gandhi's name Farmers benefit directly through both labour availability and better agricultural infrastructure.Labourers gain from higher guaranteed days, better wages, strong protections, and transparent systems.No, the guarantee is strengthened with employment days increased to 125.Major improvements were made, but they could not overcome deeper structural problems. Key gains (FY 13-14 vis-à-vis FY 2025-26):Despite these advances, misappropriation continued, digital attendance was bypassed, and assets often failed to match expenditure.The scale and persistence of these issues showed that MNREGA’s architecture had reached its limits, making a new, modernised Viksit Bharat – Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin): VB – G RAM G (विकसित भारत – जी राम जी) Bill necessary.While many attempts were made to improve its functioning, major systemic failures persisted:Because rural employment is inherently local.No. The structure is balanced and sensitive to state capacity.","The viksit bharat – guarantee for rozgar and ajeevika mission (gramin): vb – g ram g. bill modernises the system, giving guaranteed days, guaranteed priorities, and building a more accountable, targeted, and relevant employment framework for rural india.

NEW DELHI: Gujarat government on Tuesday imposed an immediate ban on the storage, sale, and distribution of rolling papers and pre-rolled cones, citing health risks, the state home department said.These ultra-thin paper sheets and cones are commonly sold at grocery stores and paan shops across the state. They are mainly used by tobacco smokers to roll cigarettes by filling raw tobacco inside.According to a notification issued by the home department, local media outlets and social organisations had raised concerns that these rolling papers, commonly known as “Gogo paper”, were also being used by youths and teenagers to smoke narcotic substances such as weed and charas.The notification said the rolling papers, which are sold in packets, contain harmful substances. These include titanium oxide, potassium nitrate, artificial dye, calcium carbonate, and chlorine bleach.Despite the harmful effects, the products were easily available at paan parlours and grocery shops, leading to the spread of addiction among young people, the notification said.The home department stated that the ban has come into force with immediate effect. Anyone found violating the order will be booked under section 223 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, which deals with disobedience of government orders.","Gujarat government imposes an immediate ban on the storage, sale, and distribution of rolling papers and pre-rolled cones.

NEW DELHI: Delhiites woke up to winter's first dense fog on Monday, with visibility dropping to zero in the city. There was havoc at Delhi airport as departures remained suspended for nearly five hours from 4am to 9am when visibility was below 100m.As many as 228 flights - 131 departures, 97 arrivals - were cancelled, over 800 delayed and five diverted to other airports, officials said. The ripple effect of delays continued long after the fog cleared around noon. At least 100 trains were running late.Safdarjung records zero visibility at 12.30am, things look up after 9amThe civil aviation ministry said dense fog conditions impacted flight operations at several airports in north India.According to India Meteorological Department, visibility began to dip sharply from Sunday night. “It dropped to 150 metres at 11.30pm. By 12.30am Monday, there was zero visibility at Safdarjung, the city’s base station. This continued till 2am and improved marginally to 100m by 2.30am. At Palam, the lowest visibility recorded was 50m at 4am,” an official said.Visibility started improving after 9am, touching 300m at Safdarjung by 9.30am and 700m by 10.30am, with the sun making an appearance.At Palam, visibility improved from 100m at 9am to 300m by 10.30am, and to 500m by noon.Flight operations were severely impacted at IGI Airport from 4am, when visibility dropped to 50m and low-visibility procedures were initiated. According to live flight tracking website Flightradar24, 260 arrivals and 400 departures were delayed till Monday evening. “Some flights arrived late at IGI due to weather conditions at the origin airport. Since they came late, these flights departed late,” said an airport official.Airport officials said pilots who are trained in CAT III procedures can make an aircraft land with a minimum visibility of 50m, while an aircraft can take off at a minimum visibility of 125m. “However, pilots who are not trained in CAT-III procedures wait at the taxiway after all formalities such as boarding are completed and take off when they get clearance as they need visibility of around 500m. This causes major flight delays,” an airport official said earlier.Apart from Delhi, flight operations were hit in many parts of north India. The civil aviation ministry posted on X, “In view of the prevailing situation, certain flights may be delayed, diverted or cancelled. Passengers are advised to stay in touch with their airlines for real-time flight updates, regularly check airport and airline websites/apps, and plan for additional travel time.”IndiGo, in a statement, said low visibility (below minima), due to dense fog, severely impacted operations at Delhi and other airports in northern India, “which is unfortunately beyond our control”. “While operations adjust to the prevailing weather, some flights may experience delays while a few others may be proactively cancelled through the day to prioritise safety and help minimise extended waiting at the airport,” said IndiGo.Air India said poor visibility due to dense fog hit operations of all airlines. “In the interest of safety and to avoid prolonged uncertainty, some flights have been cancelled,” it said on X.The civil aviation ministry said, “The Director General Civil Aviation has reviewed preparedness for fog conditions. Officers should monitor passenger inconvenience and ensure that airlines are facilitating operations and discharging responsibilities as per their respective SOPs and any directions issued.”","As many as 228 flights - 131 departures, 97 arrivals - were cancelled, over 800 delayed and five diverted to other airports. At least 100 trains were running late. Civil aviation ministry said dense fog conditions impacted flight operations at several airports in north india.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125990104,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-15628,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

'BJP-RSS conspiracy': Mallikarjun Kharge



NEW DELHI: The Centre is set to replace the two-decade-old national rural employment scheme - MGNREGA - with a new legislative framework titled the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) Bill, 2025. In response to the change, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra slammed the government questioning the intentions behind removing Mahatma Gandhi's name.The Bill, aimed at aligning rural livelihoods with the government’s long-term development vision, has been listed for introduction in the Lok Sabha, according to the supplementary list of business issued on Monday.The proposed legislation seeks to dismantle MGNREGA, enacted in 2005, and establish a new statutory regime for rural employment.Priyanka Gandhi questioned the government’s intent behind renaming the scheme, asking whether such a move was necessary in the first place. Speaking to the reporters outside the Parliament complex, she said, ""Why is Mahatma Gandhi's name being removed. Mahatma Gandhi is considered the tallest leader not just in the country but in the world, so removing his name, I really don't understand. What is the objective? What is their intention?""She further went on to argue, ""Whenever the name of a scheme is changed, there are so many changes that have to be made in offices, stationery, for which money is spent. So, what is the benefit? Why is it being done?""Priyanka Gandhi added that the move was wasteful in terms of both money and time, and said the Centre was effectively disrupting its own work by squandering valuable debate time. ""Even when we are debating, it is on other issues, not the real issues of the people. Time is being wasted, money is being wasted, they are disrupting themselves,"" Priyanka Gandhi added.Last week, when reports surfaced about the government renaming the scheme to 'Poojya Bapu Grameen Rozgar Yojana,' Priyanka Gandhi had said the exercise would be a waste of government resources and questioned what benefit the process would serve.""I can't understand what mentality is behind this. First, this is Mahatma Gandhi's name, and when it is changed, the government's resources are spent on it again,"" Priyanka Gandhi argued, ""From offices to stationery, everything has to be renamed, so this is a big, costly process. So what's the benefit of doing this unnecessarily? I can't understand.""The government would guarantee 125 days of wage employment every financial year to each rural household whose adult members are willing to undertake unskilled manual work. This is an upgrade from the minimum 100 days of wage employment.The bill positions itself as part of a broader “rural development framework aligned with the national vision of Viksit Bharat 2047”The goal of MGNREGA framed the programme to ""enhance the livelihood security""While the MGNREGA focused on the goal to ""enhance the livelihood security"", the new bill says it aims to promote ""empowerment, growth, convergence and saturation for a prosperous and resilient rural Bharat"", and lays emphasis on ""empowerment, growth, convergence and saturation through public works aggregating into forming Viksit Bharat National Rural Infrastructure Stack"".In the statement of objects and reasons, rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan acknowledged the role played by MGNREGA over the last 20 years in providing assured wage employment to rural households. However, the new legislation signals a reimagining of rural employment policy as the government seeks to transition from an entitlement-based safety net to what it describes as a future-oriented development mission.The VB-G RAM G Bill would mark the end of one of India’s most expansive social welfare programmes and the beginning of a new chapter in rural employment policy, potentially reshaping how the state supports livelihoods in the countryside.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge alleged that the proposal is part of a “BJP-RSS conspiracy” to dismantle a rights-based welfare law that benefits crores of rural poor.In a post on X, Kharge wrote: “This is not just about renaming the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. This is a BJP-RSS conspiracy to end MGNREGA.""Kharge alleged that removing Mahatma Gandhi’s name while paying symbolic tributes to him exposed what he called the government’s “hollowness and hypocrisy.” The Congress leader said that the party would oppose the move “in Parliament and on the streets” and would not allow the rights of poor workers to be taken away.""Erasing Gandhi's name on the centenary of the Sangh shows how hollow and hypocritical those are who, like Modi ji, offer flowers to Bapu on foreign soil. The Congress Party will strongly oppose in Parliament and on the streets any such decision of this arrogant regime that is against the poor and workers,"" the veteran leader further wrote.The remarks came after the Centre proposed to repeal the two-decade-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) with another legislation, titled the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB–G RAM G) Bill, 2025.The bill seeks to replace the MGNREGA with a revamped framework aimed at aligning rural employment and development with the national vision of Viksit Bharat 2047. It has been listed in the supplementary list of businesses issued on Monday.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh also objected to the proposed legislation and said the Opposition has demanded that the Bill be referred to the appropriate Parliamentary Standing Committee for detailed scrutiny.In a post on X, Ramesh said such far-reaching legislation requires “deep study and wide consultations,” in keeping with parliamentary traditions.“The entire Opposition is demanding that the following three far-reaching Bills be referred to the Standing Committees concerned. We are hopeful that in keeping with the best of Parliamentary traditions and practices, this demand will be agreed to by the Government. The Bills require deep study and wide consultations: Higher Education Commission Bill, Atomic Energy Bill and G-RAM-G Bill,” his post read.Earlier, Ramesh criticised the government’s focus on renaming schemes, accusing it of prioritising branding over substance. He questioned why Mahatma Gandhi’s name was being removed from a programme that has been in place since 2005Speaking to reporters, Ramesh said: ""The Narendra Modi government is unbeatable in changing the names of schemes and laws, no one can match it. The Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan was turned into Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the rural LPG distribution program was named Ujjwala... They are experts in packaging, branding, and naming. The surprising thing is that they hate Pandit Nehru, but they hate Mahatma Gandhi so much too; the Mahatma Gandhi National Employment Guarantee Scheme has been running since 2005. .. You are changing its name to the Venerable Bapu Employment Guarantee Scheme; what's the problem with the name Mahatma Gandhi?""","The centre is set to replace the two-decade-old national rural employment scheme - mgnrega - with a new legislative framework titled the viksit bharat guarantee for rozgar and ajeevika mission (gramin) (vb-g ram g) bill, 2025. In response to the change, congress leader priyanka gandhi vadra slammed the government questioning the intentions behind removing mahatma gandhi's name.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125974153,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1705608,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
‘Shameless’: Video of Nitish Kumar trying to remove doctor’s hijab sparks row; oppn slams Bihar CM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shameless-video-of-nitish-kumar-trying-to-remove-doctors-hijab-sparks-row-oppn-slams-bihar-cm/articleshow/125995725.cms,"“I Supported You Twice, But Never Again” Nitish Kumar Hits Out At RJD

NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday triggered a controversy after he pulled the hijab of a woman doctor during an appointment letter distribution programme.A video shared by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on X shows Nitish on stage alongside deputy chief minister Samrat Choudhary and health minister Mangal Pandey.The incident took place at a programme held at the chief minister’s residence, where appointment letters were being distributed to newly recruited AYUSH doctors.When it was the turn of Nusrat Parveen, who had arrived with her face covered with a hijab, Nitish frowned and exclaimed, “What is this?”Standing on a raised platform, Nitish then bent down and pulled the hijab down. The visibly flustered appointee was soon pulled aside by an official present at the event, while d CM Samrat Choudhary, standing beside Kumar, was seen tugging at his sleeve in an apparent attempt to restrain him.The incident drew sharp reactions from the opposition, with questions raised about Nitish Kumar’s conduct and mental health.Sharing the video on X, the RJD wrote, “What has happened to Nitish Ji? Has his mental state completely deteriorated, or has Nitish Babu now become a 100 per cent member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh?”Reacting to the incident, RJD MP Manoj Jha said the visuals were unsettling and raised serious concerns.“I have seen the visuals and they were unsettling. The Deputy CM even tried to stop him. It should be a matter of concern. As someone who has grown up in Bihar, I am worried that such visuals do not give a good message and raise several doubts,” Jha said.The Congress also attacked the Bihar chief minister, calling the act “vile.”“This is Bihar’s chief minister Nitish Kumar. Look at his shamelessness—a female doctor had come to collect her appointment letter, and Nitish Kumar pulled off her hijab. A man occupying the highest position in Bihar is openly indulging in such a vile act,” the party said in a post on X.“Nitish Kumar should immediately resign for this disgusting behaviour. This vileness is unforgivable,” it added.Congress MP Sukhdeo Bhagat also condemned the incident, accusing the chief minister of violating traditions and faith.“This does not seem appropriate from any angle. Treating a woman like this is condemnable,” Bhagat said.Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi also criticised the act, saying no one should be allowed to publicly humiliate an adult woman.“It is her dignity and knowledge of being an equal that makes her stand there to receive the acknowledgement she deserves. No father figure, CM, PM, brother or husband should be allowed to publicly humiliate an adult, educated woman for her choice of dress,” she wrote on X.According to the Chief Minister’s Office, the appointees included 685 Ayurveda doctors, 393 homeopaths and 205 practitioners of the Unani system of medicine.Of them, 10 appointees received their job letters in person from Kumar, while the rest were issued appointment letters online.","Bihar chief minister pulls hijab of woman doctor during appointment letter distribution programme.

National Herald Case: Court Declines To Act On ED Chargesheet, Congress Claims Truth Has Prevailed

New Delhi: As Congress on Tuesday said court's refusal to take cognisance of the ED chargesheet in the National Herald issue exposed Centre's use of hysteria to hype a hollow case, BJP countered that the court's ruling is no exoneration of Sonia Gandhi and a bail should not be seen as acquittal.Senior lawyer and Congress MP Abhishek Singhvi, who led the legal battle, said the matter never had any merit, but the govt used the media to exaggerate groundless claims. ""It was a strange case where no money was transferred and no property changed hands, but it was called money laundering. Young India, which controls AJL, cannot give any money, dividend or perks to the leaders sitting there. The court did not take cognisance of the case, which is the first step.It shows the case was baseless,"" he said.BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia was quick to point out that the dismissal is procedural and not on merit as there was no finding in favour of the accused. ""The primary criminal case, which originated from the private complaint filed by Subramanian Swamy, alleging cheating, criminal conspiracy, and breach of trust (the predicate offense), is still pending trial in the Court,"" he said.Claiming vindication, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said when the case was brought by the Modi govt, party leadership said ""if we didn't fear the British, BJP-RSS or Modi-Shah cannot scare us."" He added, ""Today, court too has declared Modi govt's actions illegal and foiled this conspiracy hatched with malicious intent of political revenge. We will continue our fight for 1.4 billion Indians and to save the Constitution.

Pune/Nashik: Conviction over securing a flat under a 10% EWS quota in 1995 by showing lower income has put a question mark over Manikrao Kokate's continuation as an MLA and as a Maharashtra cabinet minister.A Nashik sessions court upheld Tuesday a Feb 20 trial court judgment convicting and sentencing the sports minister and NCP functionary, along with his brother Vijay Kokate, to two years of rigorous imprisonment in the housing quota cheating case. The siblings had secured two flats. The court, however, set aside the trial court's direction to Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority and deputy collector to cancel the allotment of flats to the Kokate brothers and restore possession as earlier.Kokate represents Sinnar in rural Nashik. The ruling triggers the risk of ""immediate disqualification"" under the Representation of the People Act for sentences of two years or more, unless a higher court stays the conviction.Public prosecutor Sudhir Kotwal said the matter must now go to the high court. ""Under the law, Kokate's disqualification is certain unless he gets a suspension of his sentence and a stay on his conviction from the high court.Even with urgent circulation, this may take eight to 10 days. There is no bar on disqualification in the intervening period,"" Kotwal said.Assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar said he had not yet received the order. Supreme Court ruling from 2013 states disqualification is immediate, despite a three-month window to appeal. Relief comes only if conviction itself is stayed.Kokate's lawyer Avinash Bhide disagreed. ""We have a month's time to secure a stay and suspension from the high court. Even after that, the matter goes before the speaker,"" Bhide said.After the trial court ruling, Kokate had secured bail and on March 5, a sessions court stay on conviction and sentence during pendency of appeal. That protection has lapsed. ""Once a sessions court confirms conviction in appeal, it has no power to grant bail. The matter goes to the high court,"" Kotwal said.The prosecution said the brothers applied for flats under the EWS quota, declaring annual income of Rs 25,000 each, below the Rs 30,000 eligibility ceiling. ""Allotment relied on affidavits. When falsity emerged, onus lay on the deponents to prove otherwise,"" Kotwal said. Prosecutors said Kokate failed to disclose improved finances even by 1995, citing documents showing supplies of 70 tonnes, 80 tonnes and 120 tonnes of sugarcane in 1993, 1994 and 1995 to the Kopargaon cooperative sugar mill, yielding substantial earnings. ""This line weighed with the sessions court while affirming conviction and sentence,"" Kotwal said.Opposition parties accused BJP-headed govt of double standards, citing the swift disqualification of Congress MP Rahul Gandhi after his 2023 defamation conviction and contrasting it with the continued tenure of Kokate. ""Govt should immediately dismiss Kokate,"" Maharashtra Congress chief Harshvardhan Sapkal said. NCP state president Sunil Tatkare said the party would decide its next course of action after discussing the ruling with party chief and deputy CM Ajit Pawar.","Kokate represents sinnar in rural nashik.

Goa cops arrest Luthra brothers in Delhi on arrival from Thailand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/goa-cops-arrest-luthra-brothers-in-delhi-on-arrival-from-thailand/articleshow/126020833.cms,"NEW DELHI: The 10-day-long cat and mouse game between Indian law enforcement agencies and the Luthra brothers finally ended on Tuesday as their aircraft touched down at Delhi airport at 1.45pm. The duo — Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra — was arrested by a team of Goa police at immigration.They will be flown to Goa on Wednesday morning after a Delhi court on Tuesday granted a two-day transit remand.“We have arrested Saurabh and Gaurav,” Goa director general of police (DGP) Alok Kumar told TOI.The brothers were sent back to India from Bangkok on an ‘emergency certificate’ on Tuesday morning as their Indian passports were suspended by the ministry of external affairs shortly after they flew to Thailand.Anjuna police will produce the Luthra brothers before a judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) at Mapusa on Wednesday to seek their custody for investigation.The duo had fled India on an IndiGo flight on Dec 7, hours after a deadly blaze led to the death of 25 people at their Arpora-based nightclub, Birch by Romeo Lane. They were staying at the Indigo hotel in Phuket and returned to India on an IndiGo flight as well.On Tuesday morning, the duo was spotted at the Bangkok airport wearing masks and surrounded by immigration security officials.They were allotted seats on either side at the very back of the aircraft with security personnel accompanying them. They were produced at the Patiala House Court in New Delhi at around 6.45pm where Goa police sought three days’ custody. The JMFC granted two days of transit remand. They were medically examined and taken back to the airport after that. The brothers folded hands and nodded when reporters asked them why they fled the country.“After taking custody of the deported Luthra brothers in New Delhi and on obtaining a transit remand, Goa police is bringing both the accused to the state. A police team is likely to land in Goa along with deported and arrested accused at around 11am on Wednesday,” Goa police’s public relation officer DySP Nilesh Rane said.Goa police had registered an FIR against them under various sections of the BNS, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Last week, a local court in Delhi had rejected the transit anticipatory bail of both the accused in connection with the case.Once a lookout notice was issued, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) decided to impound their passports, which meant that they were staying without valid travel documents in Thailand. India and Thailand signed a formal extradition treaty in 2013, which came into force on June 29, 2015.The duo was detained last week by Thai authorities for staying in that country illegally. A special team had subsequently gone to Phuket on Saturday to complete the deportation process. The brothers were then brought to the Bangkok detention centre. The Indian embassy in Thailand consequently issued an emergency certificate — a one-way travel document — to the Luthras since their passport was suspended by the Indian govt.So far, Goa police have arrested Gurgaon resident Ajay Gupta, 55, a partner of the Luthra brothers, New Delhi natives Rajiv Modak, 49, chief general manager, and Priyanshu Thakur, 32, gate manager, along with UP natives Rajveer Singhania, 32, bar manager, Vivek Singh, 27, general manager, and Bharat Kohli from Delhi.When the fire broke out at the nightclub at around 11.45pm on Dec 6, there were more than 150 tourists attending an event. A preliminary investigation by police and the directorate of fire services concluded that the fire broke out after electric firecrackers struck the wooden ceiling during the event.","The duo — saurabh and gaurav luthra — was arrested by a team of goa police at immigration.
