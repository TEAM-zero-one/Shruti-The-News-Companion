MUMBAI: Two years ago, jockey Nirmal Jodha was fighting for his life. On Sunday, he was fighting for the finish line. He won both races.The 43-year-old, who battled third-stage colon cancer and dropped to just 27 kg during treatment, made a stunning comeback at Mahalaxmi Racecourse , guiding no-hoper Absolute Gorgeous past the winning post at The Star Shine Trophy .""Though I have ridden around 300 winners in my 25-year career in the saddle, this one was the sweetest of them all,"" Jodha told TOI.In Jan 2023, Jodha was diagnosed with third-stage colon cancer. ""I had been experiencing digestive discomfort for some time, and a routine clinic visit revealed an ulcer in my large intestine,"" he recalled. A biopsy confirmed it was third-stage colon cancer. ""I was completely blank. My first thought was - what will happen to my widowed mother, my wife and my three-year-old son? How will they survive if I die?""Jockeys’ Association of India and fellow riders helped him get in touch with Dr Mehli Nazir, who advised immediate admission to Ruby Hall Clinic in Pune. There, Dr Gajanan Kanitkar performed surgery in Feb 2023.What followed was a gruelling battle — aggressive chemotherapy and radiation in the months ahead brought his weight down to just 27 kg. Fortunately, his years as a jockey had trained him to handle a strict diet. A jockey’s typical weight ranges between 47kg and 55kg.Trainer Adhirajsingh Jodha, Nirmal’s employer and one of the leading names at Royal Western India Turf Club, played a crucial role in his comeback. “I asked him to keep coming to the stables just to get him out of the house and take his mind off things,” Adhirajsingh said. “At first, he just hung around, but soon, he asked for work.” By early last year, Nirmal was back at the stables. “He was so thin and weak that I only let him trot my horses — to help him regain confidence, ” Adhirajsingh said. But by the end of the Pune season in Oct, Nirmal had progressed to cantering horses.Early this Mumbai season — which runs from mid-Nov to mid-April — he secured a few rides that strengthened his resolve. Trainer P S Chouhan then entrusted him with Absolute Gorgeous. “I told him to take a good jump and do his best in the homestretch,” Chouhan said. Nirmal did not disappoint. While he’s back in the saddle, his medical journey isn’t over. “I have to go for periodic checkups to monitor for recurrence,” he said. “I’ll be on medication for the next five years.”","Two years ago, jockey nirmal jodha was fighting for his life.

Child's teary silence can't aid rapist's defence: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/childs-teary-silence-cant-aid-rapists-defence-supreme-court/articleshow/119233933.cms,"Can't equate girl's silence to that of adult prosecutrix: SC

NEW DELHI: Reversing the acquittal of a person in a 40-year-old rape case, Supreme Court said the silence of a little girl with tears rolling down her cheeks when asked about the incident in the trial court during cross-examination cannot be an indicator of innocence of the accused.Slamming the insensitivity of the Rajasthan HC judge for acquitting the accused, who was 21 when convicted and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment by the trial court in 1987 for raping the minor, SC also criticised HC for naming the rape survivor.HC took 26 years to decide the appeal of the convict and acquitted him through a six-page judgment. The Rajasthan govt's appeal, filed in 2013, was finally decided by an SC bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sanjay Karol after 12 years, indicative of the trend that while trial courts decide cases expeditiously, it is the constitutional courts where appeals linger for decades.The trial judge had recorded the child rape survivor had not deposed anything about the commission of the offence during cross-examination and when repeatedly asked, ""she shed tears in silence"".HC had taken this as one of the grounds to acquit the convict.Writing the judgment, Justice Karol said, ""This, in our view, cannot be used as a factor in favour of the accused. The tears of 'V' (minor girl) have to be understood for what they are worth. This silence cannot accrue to the benefit of the accused. The silence here is that of a child. It cannot be equated with the silence of a fully realised adult prosecutrix...""""V has not turned hostile. Trauma has engulfed her in silence. It would be unfair to burden her young shoulders with the weight of the entire prosecution. A child traumatised at a tender age by this ghastly imposition upon her must be relieved of being the basis on which her offender can be put behind bars,"" Justice Karol said and proceeded to cull out other relevant evidence, medical and circumstantial, which unequivocally pointed to the guilt of the accused, Chhatra.The medical evidence pointed to the ghastly way Chhatra sexually assaulted the girl. After examining other evidence on the case records, Justices Nath and Karol allowed the appeal, set aside the HC judgment and upheld the conviction and sentence awarded to Chatra by trial court.Chhatra, who was 22 years of age when he was convicted by the trial court in 1987, would now be over 60 years and SC directed him to surrender before the authorities concerned within four weeks to serve the sentence.","Hc took 26 years to decide the appeal of the convict and acquitted him through a six-page judgment.

SC: Obligatory for promoter, appt owner to form association

NEW DELHI: In an important decision which will allow homebuyers to take charge of their societies even if the project has not been completed, National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has held that once the Apartment Owners Association gets registered, management of the complex's common areas and facilities has to be transferred from the promoter to the association.A bench headed by chairperson of NCLAT Justice Ashok Bhushan said a real estate company has no right to resist handing over of maintenance to the association.The tribunal passed the order on a plea by the homebuyers' association of Supernova housing project in Noida, being developed by Supertech Ltd, that management of the complex be handed over to it. The bench directed the company to hand over the charge within seven days.Advocate Govind Jee, appearing for the homebuyers, told the tribunal that Supernova apartment owners had formed an association which was registered under Uttar Pradesh Apartment (Promotion of Construction, Ownership and Maintenance) Act and they should be allowed to take over management which was being looked after by a company called YG Estates. The homebuyers approached the tribunal as the project is under insolvency.Supertech argued that as per law, an association could be formed only when at least 33% of homebuyers had taken possession of their flats. In Supernova's case, only 27% of the total project has received occupancy certificate from Noida. There are 2,165 units in the project.The bench, also comprising members Barun Mitra and Arun Baroka, said it was a statutory obligation for the promoter and apartment owners to form an association.Rejecting the company's plea that 33% of apartments have to be handed over before an association is formed and that the present association was not a valid one, the tribunal said, ""We are of the view that the association having been registered and the registration of association still being valid it is not open for YG Estates to contend that registration of the association is not in accordance with the law. The issue with regard to non-fulfilment of the necessary conditions for registration of the association cannot be allowed to be raised in these proceedings nor can it be examined in these applications. When the association has been registered, it has to be presumed that registration was made after compliance of all necessary requirements.""As the parties raised questions on clearing the dues, National Company Law Appellate Tribunal directed them to appear before the Interim Resolution Professional and arrive at a settlement.""We are of the view that in these proceedings, the issues pertaining to outstanding of YG Estates or any amount accepted by YG Estates cannot be gone into or decided. We are of the view that such issues can be raised before the Interim Resolution Process who is overall in-charge of all projects and management. It is for the Interim Resolution Process to take a call and take necessary steps for settlement of accounts between the parties,"" it said.","National company law appellate tribunal (nclat) held that once the apartment owners association gets registered, management of the complex's common areas and facilities has to be transferred.

Brace for detours as Dwarka Expressway section closed for 44 days for repairs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/44-day-closure-for-dwarka-expressway-section/articleshow/119176696.cms,"The closure will affect commuters from several sectors, causing congestion and delays. NHAI aims to ensure long-term durability with this work, amidst concerns over the expressway's frequent repairs.

GURGAON: Commuters using Dwarka Expressway will brace for disruptions as entry from the elevated service road at Daulatabad Chowk towards Delhi will remain closed for 44 days as NHAI has decided to replace an expansion joint.The highway authorities put up barriers at the entry of the connecting flyover of the main carriageway on Tuesday. It will be closed till April 30. The closure is expected to impact those travelling from Sector 99 to 106 and adjoining areas of Dhankot, Basai and Kherki Majra, who will now need to take the surface road and merge onto the main expressway after Bijwasan toll plaza.According to NHAI, an accident in Jan damaged the expansion joint, prompting immediate but temporary repairs. ""However, upon further assessment, it was required to replace expansion joints to ensure long-term durability of the structure. The work will be completed in 44 days,"" said an NHAI official.The highways authorities also maintained that ""all other traffic movements will remain unaffected"" on the expressway, but daily commuters anticipate congestion and delays, especially during peak hours.The surface road, already burdened by traffic from Old Railway Road, Daultabad Road and New Palam Vihar Extension, will carry a higher volume of vehicles, slowing movement.NHAI data indicated that Dwarka Expressway sees one lakh PCU daily. The elevated road's closure is likely to increase travel time for those heading towards Delhi from the city.""The elevated road was a major time-saver, and now traffic will pile up on surface roads. The alternative routes, like Najafgarh Road, are already in poor condition, making things worse. NHAI must ensure quality checks to prevent such recurring issues, especially after investing Rs 9,000 crore on this project,"" said Abhishek Vatsa, a resident of Sector 102, who takes the expressway daily.TOI last month reported that the expressway's city section had undergone several patchworks since its inaugural last year. Though NHAI called it ""routine maintenance"", many commuters raised concerns about the expressway's frequent repair work within such a short span.""It is worrying that different sections of the expressway have been closed for repairs multiple times within a year. We hope NHAI fixes these flaws permanently instead of carrying out just patch repairs,"" said Dhananjay Jha, president of Suncity Avenue RWA.In Dec, expansion joints on the elevated portion were reported damaged near Yashobhoomi on the Delhi section, prompting the highways authority to replace them. Although the Delhi section opened to traffic in March last year, most stretches remain under construction which is expected to finish by Aug this year. In July 2024, just four months after opening, a 70m stretch near Sector 102 developed minor cracks, raising further doubts about the expressway's construction quality. The corridor, built at a cost of Rs 9,000 crore, was envisioned as a high-speed link between Delhi and Gurgaon, serving as a critical route for travellers to Dwarka, IGI Airport, South Delhi and West Delhi.The 19km Haryana section of the 8-lane Dwarka Expressway includes two stretches — one 10.2km portion from Delhi-Haryana Border to Basai rail overbridge and another 8.7km section to Kherki Daula from there.The project, which now shows signs of wear and tear, was executed reduce congestion on NH-8 and offer better connectivity between Gurgaon and Delhi.","The closure will affect commuters from several sectors, causing congestion and delays.

A schools' association said they would go ahead with exams for lower classes on that day in the interest of students.While a cab drivers' association said they won't ply Saturday, road transport corporation employees said they will take a call in a day or two.

So, we are not extending our support to the bandh,"" Gowda explained.But Vatal Nagaraj said: ""We are disappointed with Bengaluru being divided into four to seven parts.

NEW DELHI: The brutal murder of Merchant Navy officer Saurabh Rajput has sent shockwaves through Meerut, with his grieving family demanding the death penalty for his wife, Muskan Rastogi , and her alleged lover, Sahil Shukla. Saurabh’s mother, Renu Devi, accused Muskan of killing her husband, locking his body in a room, and then going on a trip as if nothing had happened.Saurabh had been missing since March 4. The horrific crime was exposed when laborers hired to move a heavy drum from the couple’s rented house struggled with its weight. When one of them questioned Muskan about its contents, she casually said it was ""house junk."" However, as they attempted to shift it, the lid accidentally opened, releasing a foul smell. Suspecting something sinister, the laborers immediately informed the police.According to Saurabh’s mother, even their young daughter might have been aware of the crime. “Neighbors told us that she (their daughter) was saying, ‘Papa has been kept in the drum.’ She might have seen something, or else why would a child say such a thing?” Renu Devi said.Police investigations revealed that Muskan and Sahil allegedly stabbed Saurabh to death, chopped up his body, and sealed the remains in a drum filled with cement to hide the crime. Muskan’s landlord had reportedly asked the couple to vacate the rented house, which is when she and Sahil attempted to shift the body.After the body was discovered, Muskan fled to her mother’s house, allegedly to inform them of what had happened. However, Saurabh’s mother claims Muskan’s family already knew about the murder. “She (Muskan) reached her mother’s house, and her mother met a lawyer before they went to court. They were trying to cover things up, but the police caught them,” Renu Devi said.Police arrested Muskan and Sahil on Tuesday and presented them before the court on Wednesday. They have been remanded to 14-day judicial custody.Meanwhile, Saurabh’s family is devastated, claiming he sacrificed everything for Muskan, only to be betrayed in the most gruesome manner. “Saurabh left his job and family for Muskan, but she took his life,” his parents said.Renu Devi recalled how Saurabh had distanced himself from his family after marrying Muskan. “I tolerated everything for the happiness of my son and daughter-in-law. Now, she has killed my son.”The grieving mother, overwhelmed with grief, demanded strict punishment. “They all (Muskan’s family) should be hanged along with that boy (Sahil),” she said.Meanwhile, Muskan’s own parents have disowned her, expressing deep remorse over her actions. “It would have been better if she was never born,” her mother, Kavita Rastogi, told reporters.Her father, Pramod Rastogi, called for the harshest punishment. “Muskan has lost the right to live. Such a person does not deserve to be alive. She fell in love with Sahil and got addicted to drugs. He destroyed her. She lost 10 kg because of drug use. But that does not justify this crime,” he said.Pramod and Kavita said that they fully support Saurabh’s family’s demand for justice. They confirmed that Muskan had been living separately from her in-laws since her marriage in 2016 due to ongoing disputes.","Merchant navy officer saurabh rajput was stabbed to death.

Row over Aurangzeb



NEW DELHI: Violence broke out in Nagpur’s Hansapuri area as unidentified individuals vandalized shops, set vehicles on fire, and hurled stones, following an earlier clash in the Mahal area that had already escalated tensions in the city, according to reports.The unrest intensified after rumours circulated about the burning of a religious book, triggering widespread stone-pelting, vandalism, and arson.Mahal and Hansapuri were the worst-affected areas, with vehicles torched and shops damaged by unidentified attackers. The violence erupted just two kilometres from the RSS headquarters, heightening security concerns.To control the situation, Nagpur Police imposed prohibitory measures under Section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita and enforced Section 144, which bans large gatherings. A curfew has been imposed in several areas. The police are reviewing CCTV footage to identify others involved.At least 10 anti-riot commandos, two senior police officers, and two firemen sustained serious injuries during the violence, while a constable remains in critical condition in the hospital.Mobs set fire to two bulldozers and 40 vehicles, including police vans, as security forces faced challenges in controlling the situation. In response, police launched a large-scale crackdown, arresting 50 rioters, while the ministry of home affairs (MHA) sought a report on the unrest.Nagpur gears up for PM Modi's expected visit amid unrestAs Nagpur deals with recent violence, the city is preparing for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's expected visit on March 30. This will be his first public appearance alongside RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat since starting his third term.Nagpur Police Commissioner Ravinder Singal assured residents that the situation is now under control and urged them not to believe in rumours. ""We have imposed Section 144, and everyone has been told not to step out unnecessarily or take the law into their own hands. Do not believe rumors. Except for this area, the entire city is peaceful,"" he said.Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis called for peace, highlighting Nagpur's history of communal harmony. ""Nagpur is a peaceful city where people share in each other's joys and sorrows. Do not believe any rumors,"" he said.Meanwhile, Congress leader Pawan Khera attacked the BJP-led state government, blaming it for failing to maintain law and order and accusing political parties of fuelling tensions.""If the VHP and Bajrang Dal organized a protest demanding the removal of Aurangzeb's tomb, did the government make no arrangements to maintain law and order?"" he questioned.From opposition bloc, Sena UBT's Sanjay Raut also reflected on the incident, saying, ""There is no reason for violence to occur in Nagpur. It is where RSS is headquartered. It is also Devendra ji's constituency. Who can have the courage to spread violence there? This is a new pattern to scare Hindus, make their own people attack them, and then incite and involve them in riots.""Security forces are conducting searches to arrest those responsible for the violence. Authorities have asked people to remain calm, avoid unnecessary travel, and not spread misinformation. The situation is being closely monitored to prevent further disturbances.The unrest also sparked a political row in the Maharashtra Assembly . State Congress chief Harshvardhan Sapkal compared CM to Mughal ruler Aurangzeb, calling him a cruel ruler. His remarks led to an uproar in the ongoing Budget session, with Mahayuti leaders demanding legal action against him.The Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal held a demonstration in Nagpur on Monday, demanding the removal of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's grave in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar. Right-wing activists gathered at the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the Mahal area, chanting slogans and burning an effigy of Aurangzeb.This controversy over Aurangzeb has also been fuelled by the newly released Vicky Kaushal-starrer film Chhava , which portrays the conflict between Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Sambhaji and Aurangzeb after Chhatrapati Shivaji's death.The issue ties into a larger historical shift, as Aurangabad was officially renamed Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar in June 2022 to honor Sambhaji Bhosale, the second Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire.","Violence broke out in nagpur’s hansapuri area as unidentified individuals vandalized shops, set vehicles on fire, and hurled stones.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday said it is ""unfortunate"" that the government has to protect Aurangzeb's grave, which is located in the Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district.Fadnavis's remark came amid growing demand from a certain section to remove the Mughal emperor's grave.""It is unfortunate that the government has to take responsibility for the protection of Aurangzeb's grave, despite his history of persecution. However, I assure you, if any attempt is made to glorify his legacy through '', it will not succeed,"" Fadnavis said at an event that he attended to inaugurate a temple dedicated to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the Thane district and lauded the Maratha king for fighting for '' and the country.""We are able to worship our gods freely today because of Shivaji Maharaj's efforts. He fought for Swarajya, for God, for our country, and our religion,"" Fadnavis was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Earlier, BJP's Satara MP Udayanraje Bhosale, who is also the descendent of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, advocated for the removal of the Mughal king's tomb situated in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar.Responding to Bhosale's request, Fadnavis clarified that despite sharing similar sentiments, actions must conform to legal procedures due to the site's protected status, which was established during the previous Congress administration.Fadnavis said, ""We all also want the same thing, but you need to do it within the framework of the law, because it is a protected site. The site was put under ASI's (Archaeological Survey of India) protection during the Congress regime some years back.""The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) protects historical tombs under the AMASR Act, 1958, ensuring their preservation. If a tomb is declared a protected monument, no construction is allowed within 100 meters, and activities in the 200-meter regulated area need approval. The ASI oversees conservation and prevents alterations or damage.Section 19(1) of the Act clearly states that no person, including government authorities, can destroy, remove, alter, or deface a protected monument without official permission.Further strengthening these protections, the AMASR (Amendment) Act, 2010, imposes strict penalties and imprisonment for unauthorised construction, alteration, or destruction of a protected monument. This means that even a state government cannot make changes to an ASI-protected tomb.Violating these rules leads to legal action, fines, or imprisonment. Unauthorized encroachments are removed, and restoration must maintain the tomb’s original character.Aurangzeb was the sixth ruler of the Mughal Empire, reigning from 1658 to 1707. He was the son of Emperor Shah Jahan and is known for expanding the Mughal Empire to its greatest territorial extent, covering almost the entire Indian subcontinent.Unlike his predecessors, Aurangzeb followed a more orthodox Islamic rule, enforcing religious policies that included the reintroduction of the jizya tax on non-Muslims and restrictions on certain cultural practices.Aurangzeb and Sambhaji Maharaj were fierce adversaries in the late 17th century. Sambhaji, the son of Chhatrapati Shivaji, was the second ruler of the Maratha Empire, while Aurangzeb was the Mughal emperor who sought to crush the Marathas and expand Mughal rule in the Deccan. Their rivalry intensified after Sambhaji ascended the throne in 1681 and continued his father’s resistance against Mughal domination.In 1689, Aurangzeb's forces captured Sambhaji near Sangameshwar through treachery. He was brutally tortured for refusing to convert to Islam and executed in an inhumane manner.His martyrdom made him a symbol of Maratha defiance, strengthening the Maratha resistance against Mughal rule. Sambhaji’s death fueled the eventual decline of Mughal power in the Deccan.","Devendra fadnavis said it is ""unfortunate"" that the government has to protect aurangzeb's grave.

SC orders direct bank transfer of payout in road accident cases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-orders-direct-bank-transfer-of-payout-in-road-accident-cases/articleshow/119233240.cms,"NEW DELHI: As an average of more than five lakh people die or get injured in road accidents every year and corresponding number of compensation claims get filed before tribunals, Supreme Court has ordered cutting down of delay in payment of recompense money to the kin or injured through direct bank transfer (DBT) method.In general, insurance companies, where the compensation amount claimed by the kin or injured is not disputed, deposit the money before motor accident claims tribunal (MACT), which delays the amount reaching the relatives of the dead or the injured as in many cases they remain unaware of such deposits made by the insurer. Enhancing the compensation payable from Rs 12 lakh, determined by HC, to Rs 36.8 lakh in a 2014 accident claim case, a bench of J K Maheshwari and Rajesh Bindal said “a direction can always be issued to transfer the amount into the bank account(s) of the claimant(s) with intimation to the tribunal.”SC said MACTs can ask the claimants at the initial stage to furnish their bank accounts and direct the insurer to directly transfer the undisputed amount to their accounts. It said that the same DBT method can be adopted by the insurers when the tribunal makes the final award on the claims. The bench passed this order considering the large number of deaths and injuries caused by road accidents in the last five years. For the year 2018, road accident deaths were 1.5 lakh, and 4.6 lakh were injured; 2019 — 1.5 lakh deaths and 4.4 lakh injuries; 2020 — 1.3 lakh deaths and 3.4 injuries; 2021 — 1.5 lakh deaths and 3.8 lakh injuries; 2022 – 1.6 lakh deaths and 4.4 lakh injuries.

BATHINDA/PATIALA: Punjab Police on Wednesday detained fasting farmer activist Jagjit Singh Dallewal and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha head Sarvan Singh Pandher as well as other prominent agitators in Mohali when they were returning after attending a meeting with a central govt delegation in Chandigarh and also evicted protesting farmers from the Shambhu and Khanauri borders.The evictions began despite assurances from Punjab ministers about the AAP govt having no plans to disturb farm protesters or the two protest sites at Shambhu and Khanauri. By late Wednesday evening, the two sites had been cleared of protesters. More than 250 protesters were detained from Khanauri, some from Mohali, and 110 from Shambhu, a senior Punjab Police officer said, adding that they were shifted to a marriage hall. Wednesday's meeting was the seventh round of talks between the two sides since February 2024 and discussions centred on the main demand for a law guaranteeing MSP for crops.After Wednesday's talks, central ministers have decided to appoint a joint secretary to engage with various stakeholders to delve deeper into the contentious issue of MSP. The next round of meetings is scheduled for May 4.Joint secretary Purna Chand Kishan will be engaging with agriculture experts and farm activists. The development comes after farmers presented compelling data from reputable agencies like Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Crisil, and RBI.The data highlighted the financial implications of providing MSP. The farmers were proceeding to the Shambhu border from Chandigarh, from where Dallewal and other agitators accompanying him were to head to Khanauri. However, they were picked up right after crossing into Punjab, in Jagatpura area of Mohali. Dallewal was detained in his ambulance, and others with their vehicles after some resistance from the farmers. Pandher was picked up from his vehicle even though he tried to get away.The farmers were apprehending some kind of action given the heavy police deployment at both protest sites, but they expected it at Shambhu and Khanauri. Punjab police rounded up a few hundred farmers at the Khanauri interstate border late Wednesday evening. The turbans of several farmers were tossed during minor scuffles as they were being put into buses by authorities to clear the protest site.BKU Ekta Sidhupur leader Kulwant Singh claimed that all the belongings and tractor trailers parked on the highway were left behind as police didn’t give them time, especially to elderly farmers, to vacate. BKU Ekta Sidhupur farmer Deepu, who is close to Dallewal, said police forcibly rounded up over 150 farmers in a matter of minutes. Sangrur SSP Sartaj Singh Chahal said the operation was carried out peacefully and police did not engage in any clash with farmers. However, the farmers claimed that police used force to round them up at Khanauri.","Punjab police detained fasting farmer activist jagjit singh dallewal and kisan mazdoor morcha head sarvan singh pandher as well as other prominent agitators in mohali.

NEW DELHI: The discussion on the working of the home ministry in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday took a fiery turn with treasury benches strongly protesting ""objectionable"" remarks made by TMC member Saket Gokhale who, while initiating the debate, took potshots at home minister Amit Shah and the functioning of the ministry.The RS chairman too took strong objection to what he called Gokhale's repeated ""personal observations and remarks"" on Shah and called for deletion and expunction of the same from the proceedings. The chairman said he would give his ruling in the matter on Thursday.Gokhale took on the home ministry and Shah alleging that central agencies like CBI and NIA were being controlled and used to attack govts in opposition-governed states and people who disagreed with BJP dispensation at Centre. RS chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar repeatedly intervened, asking Gokhale to withdraw some of his remarks which the latter refused to do, leading the chair to call for deletion of what it termed ""unparliamentary"" expressions.""MHA feels that the Union govt is the sole representative of the republic and the states don't mean anything.

He went on to assert that Gokhale was misleading the House by giving wrong information and said not all CBI cases the TMC member referred to were corruption cases.
