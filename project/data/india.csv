48hr deadline set to trace missing SLBC workers in collapsed tunnel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/48hr-deadline-set-to-trace-missing-slbc-workers-in-collapsed-tunnel/articleshow/118589371.cms,"HYDERABAD: Telangana's govt set a two-day deadline from Wednesday evening for the team of experts working to trace the eight workers buried under the collapsed Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) tunnel since Feb 22.""We have not lost hope and are working in the belief that they (the workers) are still alive,"" said Telangana irrigation minister N Uttam Kumar Reddy even as the state mobilised an array of specialised forces, including the Indian Army, Marine Commando Force, special forces of the Indian Navy,Border Roads Organisation (BRO), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), and rat miners, to carry out rescue operations.On Wednesday afternoon, tunnel experts and disaster management officials inspected the tunnel. The team included BRO tunnel expert Col Parikshit Mehra, BRO former DG Gen Harpal Singh, and BRO former ADG KP Purushothaman, along with NDRF personnel.According to Uttam Kumar Reddy, the tunnel boring machine (TBM) that malfunctioned during the accident will be cut into pieces using gas-cutters and welding machines and removed from the tunnel. Meanwhile, the accumulated fine silt will be cleared manually and with the help of a small Bobcat machine.Silt removal will begin from the far end of the tunnel, progressing towards the entry point. Additionally, two 100 HP pumps will be employed to dewater the tunnel and manage the silt, Uttam said at Domalapenta, near the tunnel site.Govt is also exploring alternative access routes to expedite the rescue operation.This includes a proposal to create a bypass around 300 meters from the TBM area and reach the trapped workers by drilling. This bypass would facilitate the movement of manpower and machinery to the collapsed section of the tunnel where the roof gave way and where the TBM parts are now lodged, officials said.Uttam Kumar Reddy acknowledged that the scale of slush inside the tunnel had slowed down rescue efforts, but emphasised that the safety of the rescuers was govt's top priority. He said, ""We assessed the situation thoroughly and devised clear strategies to minimise risk for the rescuers and move forward efficiently.""Real-time monitoring of tunnel conditions is underway, with advanced imaging systems in place to assess structural stability.This ensures that rescue teams can continue their efforts without jeopardising their safety or that of the trapped workers.Earlier in the day, ministers Uttam and Komatireddy Venkat Reddy met senior officials, including Col Mehra, Navy officer VK Prasad, NDRF DIG Mohsen Shahedi, rat miners and BRO representatives to discuss effective ways to expedite the rescue operation.","Telangana's govt set a two-day deadline from wednesday evening for the team of experts working to trace the eight workers buried under the collapsed srisailam left bank canal (slbc) tunnel. ""we have not lost hope and are working in the belief that they (the workers) are still alive,"" said telangana irrigation minister n uttam kumar reddy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118589426,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1922508,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Cabinet clears decks for tabling of Waqf bill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cabinet-clears-decks-for-tabling-of-waqf-bill/articleshow/118589208.cms,"NEW DELHI: Cabinet has approved the proposed amendments to the Waqf (Amendment) Bill incorporating the changes recently recommended by the Parliamentary panel, paving the way for it to be tabled for discussion and passage in the second half of the budget session.TOI has learnt that the govt has incorporated most of the changes recommended by the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) headed by Jagdambika Pal and the Cabinet cleared it last week along with the Indian Port Bill . The bill has been put in the priority list by the govt as part of its legislative business .The bill was referred to the JPC in August 2024 after it was introduced in the Lok Sabha by minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju.The parliamentary panel adopted the report with majority vote while all 11 MPs from opposition parties in the panel had objected to the report. They had also moved dissent notes.The 655-page report was submitted to both the Houses of Parliament earlier this month. The panel while doing away with the ""Waqf by User"" provision, going forward, has allowed only existing ""Registered Waqf by User"" to be recognised as waqf.This will exclude the cases where the properties are under dispute or owned by the govt. As per the report, the panel had supported inclusion of non-Muslims in waqf boards, which can go upto four and recommended transfer of dispute investigation authority from district collectors to senior state govt appointees.The state waqf boards will now include one member from the Muslim OBC community, ensuring broader representation.",The govt has incorporated most of the changes recommended by the joint parliamentary committee.

Silkyara tunnel heroes say Telangana battle tougher: 'Men trapped inside are silent',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/silkyara-tunnel-heroes-say-telangana-battle-tougher-men-trapped-inside-are-silent/articleshow/118587404.cms,"‘In Silkyara we could hear them, here it’s just silence’

DEHRADUN: The tunnel has collapsed. Water and silt flood the narrow passage.Deep underground, there are eight men - trapped, unheard, unseen. At the mouth of the Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) in Telangana, hundreds of rescuers battle against time, fighting to bring them back.Among them are three men who have been there before - and done that. Though in a different catastrophe, high up in the hills of Uttarakhand.Over a year ago, they had stood at the opening of another collapsed tunnel, overseeing another desperate mission. Then, too, hope hung by a thread. A diary entry would perhaps read: Silkyara, Uttarkashi. 41 men, 17 days.In the swirling dust and tension, the men who once defied the odds in Uttarakhand are fighting to do it again in Telangana even as they admit the battle this time is harder.A senior supervisor from the Silkyara tunnel project, Shashi Bhushan Chauhan , now standing at the SLBC collapse site, told TOI on Wednesday: ""Life has come full circle for us."" The words hang heavy in the damp air, thick with the smell of wet earth and diesel fumes. His voice is hoarse with exhaustion. It was in Nov 2023 that Chauhan first became a footnote in history, working beside an auger machine in the race to free the workers trapped inside Silkyara's blocked tunnel.This time, the crisis is different. The SLBC tunnel is narrower - just 33 feet wide compared to Silkyara's 45 feet. The tunnel boring machine (TBM) is stuck. Water and sludge keep pushing in. Communication lines? Non-existent. The men trapped in are silent. And silence is the worst kind of omen in a rescue mission. But Chauhan and his team - a mechanic and an industrial fabricator from the Navayuga Group - do not deal in omens. They deal in steel, sweat, and a deep, unspoken understanding of what it means to pull men from the earth before it swallows them.""The teamwork feels the same as it did in Silkyara - everyone pushing forward, driven by a single mission,"" Chauhan said. ""But there's one crucial difference. In Silkyara, we could hear them. We knew they were there, that they were holding on. Here, there's only silence. No voices, no signals, nothing. That uncertainty makes this even harder. We don't know their condition, and that makes every second feel heavier.""Another rescuer explains why this operation is even more challenging. ""The auger machine we used in Silkyara? That's not an option here. There's too much water, too much silt. The ground is shifting, unpredictable. We dewater, and more water rushes in. We clear the silt, and fresh sludge takes its place. Every step forward feels like one step back.""Hope, however, comes in the form of men who are built for the impossible. A six-member crew of ' rat-hole miners ', the underground warriors who crawled through Silkyara's debris to bring the last workers to safety, are standing by, ready to descend into the unknown again.""Our team arrived on Sunday. We're waiting,"" says Wakeel Hasan, their leader. ""When the moment comes, we go in."" No bravado, no unnecessary words.Just the quiet, unwavering certainty of men who have walked into darkness before and come out carrying lives.","'in silkyara we could hear them, here it’s just silence’ - rescuer. Three men who have been there before - and done that. Over a year ago, they had stood at the opening of another collapsed tunnel, overseeing another desperate mission.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118587443,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-915616,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Supreme Court stays Centre's green clearance exemption order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-stays-centres-green-clearance-exemption-order/articleshow/118587341.cms,"MUMBAI: Supreme Court has stayed a recent notification by the Centre placing certain projects out of the purview of prior clearance under the environment impact assessment norms and issued notice to the environment ministry on a public interest litigation (PIL), reports Swati Deshpande.NGO Vanashakti had on Feb 16 moved the PIL, saying the notification significantly diluted the stringent environmental clearances (EC) regime. It sought quashing of a Jan 29 notification by the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change doing away with mandatory prior EC for construction projects with a built-up area up to 1,50,000 sq m in cases of industrial sheds, and school, college and hostel for educational institutions.The PIL filed in SC by an NGO against the Centre's move exempting certain projects from prior green nod also challenged a Jan 30 memorandum which clarified that educational institutions would include private technical institutions, professional academies, universities along with warehouses, industrial sheds, housing machinery etc.The SC bench of Justices Abhay Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan on Monday heard senior counsel Gopal Sankaranarayanan for the NGO and issued notice to Centre. The next hearing is on March 28. The SC order said, ""In the meanwhile, there will be stay of operation and implementation of the notification dated 29th January, 2025 as well as office memorandum dated 30th January, 2025.""The new notification excludes all such projects from the purview of environment impact assessment or EIA, 2006 as against the current criteria, which requires prior EC for all building and construction projects having a built-up area above 20,000 sq m. The PIL said, ""General conditions have been made inapplicable to building construction projects thereby seriously affecting the process of appraisal of all such projects in eco-sensitive areas, protected areas under Wildlife Act, critically and severally polluted areas and projects located at inter-state boundaries.""If the new notification is enforced, it ""would potentially destroy the land, water and air environment and ecology due to unregulated construction activities which would have a disastrous effect leaving a magnitude of environmental footprint that would be impossible to determine and reverse,"" said the PIL, stressing that a built-up area of 20,000 sq m is itself a fairly large size of 2.16 lakh sq ft, but the new, higher cut-off would mean 16 lakh sq ft of construction would not need any prior EC. The notification would have done away with the need for prior EC for a large number of projects in Mumbai, legal experts said.","Ngo vanashakti had on feb 16 moved the pil, saying the notification significantly diluted the stringent environmental clearances (ec) regime.

The flyover was meant to eliminate the signal at TIDEL Park and ensure uninterrupted flow of traffic on the stretch from SRP Tools to Madhya Kailash.Under the new plan, vehicles going from Thiruvanmiyur towards Madhya Kailash should turn left, use the flyover, and merge onto OMR.

After AAP general secretary (organisation) Sandeep Pathak announced Arora's candidature, the latter said on X, ""Humbled and grateful to the leadership of AAP for reposing faith in me to contest the Ludhiana West by-election. As someone deeply connected to my hometown, I look forward to serving my people with dedication and sincerity.""On speculation that Kejriwal may go to Rajya Sabha, Arora told TOI, ""Kejriwal ji has no interest in coming to Rajya Sabha and if at all he had a wish to come to the upper House, any of the sitting MPs of AAP would have given up their seat to make way for him. He does not have to wait for the outcome of an assembly bypoll."" An industrialist from Ludhiana, Arora was elected to RS in 2022. AAP's chief national spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar too dismissed the Kejriwal-for-RS speculation and said, ""As far as Arvind Kejriwal is concerned, media sources were earlier saying he will become the chief minister of Punjab. Now, they are saying he will go to Rajya Sabha. Both these sources are absolutely wrong. Arvind Kejriwal is not going to Rajya Sabha.""The assertions did not stop BJP and Congress from attacking AAP.

7 BJP MLAs join Nitish Kumar cabinet: Changed power dynamics at play in Bihar?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/7-bjp-mlas-join-nitish-kumar-cabinet-changed-power-dynamics-at-play-in-bihar/articleshow/118584163.cms,"NEW DELHI: Is the stage set for a shift in power dynamics within the ruling NDA in Bihar ? Is it the beginning of BJP 's assertion over JD(U) in Bihar? Well, the answer to these questions is ""yes"" if today's cabinet expansion in the state is an indication to go by.Chief minister Nitish Kumar inducted 7 new faces in his ministry - all of them members of his alliance partner the BJP. The cabinet expansion, which was pending for almost a year, was finalised after BJP chief JP Nadda had a meeting with Nitish Kumar.Today's expansion, possibly the last one ahead of year-end assembly elections, has ensured that the two main NDA partners in the state - the BJP and the JD(U) - have representation in the ministry proportional to their numerical strength in the assembly. The BJP, which won 74 seats in the 2020 assembly elections now has 21 ministers while Nitish Kumar's JD(U), which won 43 seats, has 13 including the chief minister.Also read: BJP gets nervous every time Nitish Kumar picks up his phone,' Congress reacts to Bihar cabinet expansion The 2020 assembly elections marked a significant shift in number dynamics within the ruling NDA in Bihar. For the first time, the BJP, which was the junior partner in the alliance for over 15 years, overtook the JD(U) in the numbers game and became the senior partner of the alliance. However, the BJP then did not stake claim to the chief minister's post and kept its pre-poll promise of forming the NDA government under Nitish Kumar.In all earlier assembly elections after 2000, when Jharkhand was bifurcated out of Bihar, the JD(U) always won more seats than the BJP and was the dominant partner. For almost two decades, Nitish Kumar was the undisputed leader of the alliance.However, going ahead, this may change and the cabinet expansion was perhaps the first big indication.""The cabinet expansion is the first sign of BJP assertion over JD(U) and it is the beginning. In the coming days, the BJP will assert more as the party realises this could be its best time to dominate in Bihar,"" says political analyst and former professor of Patna University N K Choudhary.Choudhary has an interesting take on why Nitish can't complain about BJP dominance. ""Politics is not for social service. For almost two decades, Nitish Kumar ensured that state BJP leaders played second fiddle to him. He he could do that because he was a tall and undisputed leader. But that seems to be changing now and the last elections saw JD(U) become a junior partner in alliance. The BJP on the other hand has a very strong national leadership at present and it is natural that it will not play second fiddle any more,"" Choudhary adds.Those who know Nitish Kumar's style of governance in the last 20 years would agree that if given a free hand, the Bihar chief minister would not have opted for cabinet expansion with elections in the state just months away. But the BJP, confident with its electoral successes in Haryana, Maharashtra and Delhi, would surely have other plans for the state.Also read: Who are 7 new ministers in Nitish Kumar's cabinet and why BJP picked them A close look at the names picked up by the BJP would show that the party has carefully used the exercise to plan for the assembly elections.The list of new ministers includes a JD(U) leader who has represented Bihar Sharif, in the CM's pocket borough Nalanda, for five times, thrice on a JD(U) ticket before crossing over to the BJP in 2015.Another notable entry is Krishna Kumar Mantu, the MLA from Amnour in Saran district, who was recently in the news for organising a ""Kurmi Chetna Rally"" in Patna. This is interesting because Nitish Kumar belongs to this powerful OBC community and one wonders why he would want a leader who is mobilising Kurmis for BJP in his cabinet.Nitish Kumar, who has earned the dubious distinction of ""Paltu ram"" due to his alliance flip-flops, faces a tough road ahead. It will be interesting to see how the JD(U) chief who has dictated terms in the past negotiates a demanding BJP going ahead.","Nitish kumar inducted 7 new faces in his ministry - all of them members of his alliance partner the bjp. The bjp, which won 74 seats in the 2020 assembly elections now has 21 ministers. Nitish kumar's jd(u), which won 43 seats, has 13 including the chief minister.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118584378,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1434780,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Panel: Give ‘exemplary penalty’ to curb ‘sarpanch patis’ practice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/impose-exemplary-penalties-to-curb-practice-of-sarpanch-patis-in-pris-suggests-panel/articleshow/118584389.cms,"NEW DELHI: To curb the practice of proxy participation of husbands and other male relatives often referred to as “Sarpanch patis”, “Mukhiya Patis” and “Pradhan Patis” in place of elected women ‘pradhans’ in gram panchayats, an advisory committee set up by the ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) has suggested that “exemplary penalties” should be enforced for proven cases of proxy leadership .The committee has also suggested a robust reporting mechanism through helplines and womens watchdog committees for confidential complaints about proxy leadership, with whistleblower rewards in verified cases.The report on “Transforming Women’s Representation and Roles in Panchayati Raj Systems and Institutions: Eliminating Efforts for Proxy Participation” submitted to the secretary of the ministry has also suggested a detailed roadmap on the way forward with interventions ranging from behavioural change through capacity-building and mentorship, and establishing a monitoring framework from the grassroots to the top.The advisory committee was set-up by the ministry in September 2023 following the Supreme Court’s order of July on the issue. Besides research of available literature and extensive consultations with the state govts, the report is based on interactions of four intensive regional workshops involving 14 States.Secretary MoPR, Vivek Bharadwaj told TOI that they are developing an action plan which will be discussed and shared with states for consultation and execution. “To begin with we will be launching a capacity building programme exclusively for elected women representatives next week which will be looking at leadership and its challenges from the women’s perspective to equip them better to execute their roles,” Bharadwaj said.On the suggestion for penalties and punishments in cases of proxy leadership, he said that they are considering setting up a committee of secretaries of states going forward to study and decide how legal measures can be standardised and executed on the ground to create deterrence.The 73rd Constitutional (Amendment) Act 1992 mandates one-third reservation of seats for women in the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs). However, 21 States and 2 UTs have expanded this Constitutional provision and extended reservation for women to the extent of 50% in the PRIs. In nearly 2.63 lakh panchayats — out of the 32.29 lakh elected representatives approximately 15.03 lakh (around 47%) are women.Some of the key policy interventions and structural reforms suggested by the committee include creating gender-exclusive quotas in some Panchayat subject committees and ward-level committees on the lines of Kerala; appointing women’s ombuds-persons and federation of women Panchayat leaders. The report also calls for institutionalising gender-responsive budgets in Panchayat meetings.The report also calls for leveraging technology to combat the problem by adopting interventions like virtual reality (VR) simulation training; integrating AI-powered query-driven replies to provide real-time legal and governance guidance to women elected representatives in vernacular languages.For stepping up monitoring, it is recommended that WhatsApp Groups of women representatives could be created and linked with officials of Panchayats and Block Officials to help solve the day-to-day problems. Also the MoPR’s Panchayat Nirnay Portal can serve as a platform for citizens to track elected Pradhans’ participation in meetings and decisions for public accountability and discouraging proxy leadership.The committee has also recommended direct mentorship of elected women pradhans by the MLAs and MP and dedicated women-only monitoring councils at district and block levels, comprising experienced women ERs and retired officials.",The committee has also suggested a robust reporting mechanism through helplines and womens watchdog committees. In nearly 2.63 lakh panchayats — out of the 32.29 lakh elected representatives approximately 15.03 lakh (around 47%) are women.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday attended the Maha Shivratri celebrations at Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev's Isha Foundation in Coimbatore. Addressing a gathering, Shah extended his greetings on the occasion of the festival.""I bow down at the feet of 'Aadiyogi'. I consider myself very fortunate to be here at the invitation of Sadguru ji. I express my heartfelt gratitude to Sadguru ji for this opportunity. Today, from Somnath to Kedarnath, from Pashupatinath to Rameswaram, and from Kashi to Coimbatore, the entire country is filled with Shiva's presence. Today, the Maha Kumbh is concluding in Prayagraj, and here, I am witnessing the Maha Kumbh of devotion,"" he said.Talking about his experience at Isha Foundation, Shah said, ""Coming here, one can experience a journey from consciousness to collective consciousness, from self-interest to ultimate welfare, and from self to the universe.""Welcoming Shah at the Foundation, Sadhguru said, “Our Union home minister’s work in some way a reflection of what Sardar Patel did at that time. And this is fantastic because we must understand, without maintaining the basic sovereignty and law and order in the country, all other aspirations of economic development, of education, of technology, of spirituality, everything will go in waste.”He also talked about the importance of Maha Shivratri and said, “No matter what religion, race, creed, caste, whatever you are, if you are human and you have an erect spine, Mahashivratri is relevant for you, Adiyogi is relevant for you, the yogic sciences are absolutely relevant for you.”Earlier today, Sadhguru welcomed Shah to the Yoga Center, where the minister, along with other dignitaries, participated in the Pancha Bhuta Kriya—a cleansing ritual of the five elements—conducted by Sadhguru at the Dhyanalinga, a powerful energy form consecrated as a gateway to liberation.This came after Shah virtually inaugurated BJP's offices at Tiruvannamalai and Ramanathapuram.He also addressed a gathering earlier today where he slammed the DMK government in Tamil Nadu over central funds and delimitation.""Tamil Nadu government provided security during the last journey of 1998 bomb blast accused and mastermind (SA Basha),"" he said.""They are going to do a meeting on delimitation saying we won't allow any injustice to south,"" he added.He expressed confidence that the NDA would secure power in Tamil Nadu after next year’s assembly elections, predicting a victory even greater than the saffron bloc's successes in Maharashtra and Haryana.","Union home minister amit shah attended the maha shivratri celebrations at sadhguru jaggi vasudev's isha foundation in coimbatore.

NEW DELHI: A 26-year-old woman was allegedly raped inside a state transport bus early Tuesday morning when it was parked at Swargate bus stand in Pune, just a few meters away from the police station.The victim stated that while waiting for a Phaltan-bound bus at 5.45 am on Tuesday, a man approached her, addressing her as 'Didi', and directed her to another platform claiming her bus had arrived. He led her to an unoccupied 'Shiv Shahi' AC bus in the station premises, news agency PTI reported.Initially reluctant to enter the unlit bus, she was persuaded by the man who suggested she could verify using a torch. The woman reported to police that he followed her inside and committed the assault before escaping.The police have identified the suspect as Dattatraya Ramdas Gade (36) through CCTV footage. He has previous cases of theft and chain snatching, according to Swargate police station officials.The police said that they have deployed multiple teams to apprehend him.Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar called the incident ""extremely shameful, painful, and infuriating"" and said that there is only one punishment and that is death penalty.""I have personally instructed the Pune Police Commissioner to closely monitor the investigation and ensure immediate arrest of the accused. CM Devendra Fadnavis has also taken the incident seriously and has given the necessary instructions to the police. The police will arrest the accused at the earliest and the state government will take all necessary steps to ensure that the accused is given the harshest punishment,"" Ajit Pawar said.He gave assurance to all the people of Maharashtra and added that instructions have been given to the women and child development minister and the chairperson of the state women’s commission to provide justice, mental support, and all possible assistance to the victim.Deputy Commissioner of Police Smartana Patil confirmed that surveillance footage showed the woman walking with the accused towards the bus.DCP Smarthana Patil said, ""A working woman was waiting for the bus to go back to her home...A man came and said that the bus to your place has been parked somewhere else and took the woman near the parked bus...Then, the man raped the woman...A complaint has been registered...We have identified the accused, and we are making all the efforts to nab him. The accused is identified as Dattatray Ramdas Gade. The victim is stable right now...""The DCP noted that despite the presence of numerous people and buses, the victim initially continued her journey to Phaltan, discussing the incident with a friend over phone while travelling.Following her friend's counsel, she alighted within city limits and reported to the police station, Patil explained.Officials confirmed the victim was stable and provided a clear statement, leading to registration of a rape case under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.The DCP revealed Gade's previous cases in Shikrapur and Shirur police jurisdictions, with eight teams now pursuing his capture.A canine unit has been deployed in the investigation.This incident has sparked criticism from opposition leaders who criticised the home department, under chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, for inadequate handling of rising crime in Pune.The Shiv Sena (UBT) workers smashed window panes and damaged furniture in the security office, while women activists raised slogans against the BJP-led Maharashtra government, according to news agency PTI.“The incident that took place here, it happened in front of security cabin. If a woman is raped in front of security cabin, nobody has the right to sit there,” Vasant More justified the vandalism while talking to ANI.NCP (SP) representative and Baramati MP Supriya Sule criticised the BJP-led government over the incident.She highlighted the presence of nearby police posts and regular patrols in the area.""Still such an assault takes place at Swargate, which shows that anti-social elements do not have any fear of law. The home department has failed to curb crime in Pune. The trial of this case should be held in a fast-track court and the accused must get a severe punishment,"" Sule told reporters.Maharashtra Congress chief Harshwardhan Sapkal noted increasing rape incidents in the state. He emphasised that MSRTC buses are vital for Maharashtra's transport, yet now face such incidents.""When the Nirbhaya gangrape incident took place in Delhi, people changed the regime. You (BJP-led government) promote Laadki Bahin scheme for women (providing financial aid), but ignore basic issues of the people,"" he said.National Commission for Women (NCW) took suo motu cognizance of Pune bus rape case and sought urgent action.NCW strongly condemn the heinous crime and said that reports indicate that the accused is currently absconding, raising serious concerns about public safety and law enforcement measures.""In her letter, the NCW Chairperson has directed the police authorities to take the following immediate steps:1. Ensure a fair and time-bound investigation into the incident, leaving no room for delay or negligence.2. Extend all necessary support to the victim, including medical assistance, psychological counseling, and security to safeguard her well- being.3. Arrest the accused at the earliest and ensure strict legal proceedings under the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 to bring the perpetrator to justice,"" the letter read",A 26-year-old woman was allegedly raped inside a state transport bus early tuesday morning when it was parked at swargate bus stand in pune.

Kumaraswamy was Karnataka CM at the time.The submission, made on Feb 21, includes an English translation of all case documents and addresses Raj Bhavan's previous request for clarity regarding notes and case sheets which were in Kannada. ""The ball is now in the governor's court,"" a senior Lokayukta official said.The case revolves around allegations that Kumaraswamy illegally approved a 550-acre mining lease to Sri Sai Venkateshwara Minerals in Sandur taluk, Ballari district, enabling large-scale illegal mining. The 2011 Karnataka Lokayukta report by Justice N Santhosh Hegde first flagged these alleged violations. Kumaraswamy had been under threat of arrest but secured bail in 2015.The key allegation is that Kumaraswamy bypassed Minerals Concession Rules and ignored the chief secretary's advice while approving the mining lease. However, Kumaraswamy has maintained his innocence, stating he never signed the disputed file.The initial request for prosecution sanction was made to the governor on Nov 21, 2023. The governor, after seeking clarification on July 29, 2024, returned the file on Aug 29, 2024, instructing the Lokayukta to provide English translations of over 5,000 pages. With the translated documents now in place, SIT awaits Raj Bhavan's decision while exploring additional legal options.CM Siddaramaiah has raised concerns over delay in granting prosecution permission.

The court ruled a false promise amounts to ""misconception of fact"" that invalidates a girl's consent, reports Vaibhav Ganjapure.Justice Urmila Joshi-Phalke rejected the accused's argument the girl had willingly engaged in sexual relations. A minor's consent is legally irrelevant, HC said. ""The accused misled her by promising marriage,"" she observed.Following the 16-year-old's complaint, FIR was lodged in May 2019. The girl said the accused sexually exploited her multiple times after promising to marry her. But when she conceived and approached him for marriage, the man refused. The accused was convicted by a special Pocso court and sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment.He had challenegd the decision. Challenging the decision, he said claimed the relationship was consensual. Justice Joshi-Phalke held the accused's intentions were dishonest from the outset. ""It is not merely a case of breach of promise, but of seduction as well. A false promise was made, and the survivor was subjected to sexual assault.Since the survivor was below 16 years, her consent is not relevant. She was under the misconception that he intended to marry her and, therefore, she submitted to sexual intercourse,"" the order said. The judge remarked that the DNA report corroborated the survivor's testimony, strengthening the prosecution's case.Justice Joshi-Phalke also underlined that the accused failed to present evidence demonstrating he genuinely intended to marry the survivor at any point. The court concluded the accused's conduct reflected a ""culpable mental state"" involving intention, motive, and knowledge, leaving no doubt about his guilt, and affirmed the sentence imposed by the Bhandara Pocso court.","Bombay hc upholds rape conviction of a man for sexually assaulting a minor under pretext of marriage.

NEW DELHI: In an order that is likely to have wider ramifications, J&K and Ladakh high court has said that if a highway is in bad shape ""due to different nature of construction activities"", NHAI or its concessionaire cannot collect toll tax from commuters.Hearing a PIL on the Pathankot-Udhampur stretch of NH-44, a bench of Chief Justice Tashi Rabstan and Justice M A Choudhary Tuesday ordered NHAI to collect only 20% of the toll, with immediate effect, at two toll plazas - Lakhanpur and Bann - till the highway from Lakhanpur to Udhampur is fully operational.HC also directed NHAI not to establish any plaza within 60 km of NH-44 and instructed removal of such structures within two months. ""Further, there should not be mushrooming of such plazas in the two UTs only with the sole aim and objective of minting money from the general public,"" it said.Though NHAI has the power to suspend or reduce 'user fee', popularly known as toll, on unfinished or dilapidated NHs, it has rarely used this provision. Poor maintenance, riding quality and diversions during expansion of projects have been major irritants for commuters as they are made to pay full user fee without getting the desired benefit.One Sugandha Sawhney had filed the PIL seeking exemption of toll at Lakhanpur, Thandi Khui and Bann plazas on the national highway from Pathankot to Udhampur, where construction is underway as a part of the Delhi-Amritsar-Katra Expressway project. The petitioner had submitted that about 60% to 70% of this stretch is under construction since December, 2021, yet NHAI was collecting toll at Lakhanpur, Thandi Khui and Ban plazas despite the rules saying that collection of fee should commence within 45 days from the date of completion of the section.While passing the order, the court said, ""This is based on the principle that tolls are collected to provide users with the benefit of well maintained infrastructure. If this highway is in a deteriorated condition and uncomfortable to drive on, it is considered unfair for commuters to continue paying tolls, rather the same is violation of fair service. Certainly, the commuters and drivers must be feeling frustrated by the poor state of this particular highway they are paying to use. The basic premise is that tolls should be a form of compensation for road users in exchange for smooth, safe, and well-maintained highways.""The court took note of the NHAI submission that due to different nature of construction works being carried out at this highway, service roads and diversions have been provided for the movement of traffic; meaning thereby the 4-lane NH at most of the places has been reduced to single lane.","Nhai rarely uses power to cut toll on unfinished roads.
