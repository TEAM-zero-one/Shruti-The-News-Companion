LUCKNOW: Abhishek Prakash , CEO of Invest UP and former district magistrate of Lucknow, was suspended Thursday following charges of irregularities in the evaluation process for a proposed solar manufacturing project in the state. Also, the city police Thursday arrested a middleman on the charge of demanding a bribe for the approval of the solar project, at the behest of a senior official of Invest UP.The charges against Prakash, a 2006-batch IAS officer, were investigated and have been, prima facie, found to be true, a govt press release said. The inquiry concluded that his conduct could hinder objectives of the UP Industrial Investment and Employment Promotion Policy 2022, damaging investor confidence and tarnishing the state’s image as an investment-friendly destination, the press release added.Sources in the govt said the chief minister’s office (CMO) directed aprobe into the case after receiving a complaint. In the complaint, Vishwajit Datta of SAEL Solar P6 Pvt Ltd wrote to the CMO on March 20 stating that his firm wanted to set up a manufacturing unit for solar cells and solar powerrelated parts in UP. He further stated that officials at Invest UP demanded 5% of the project cost to clear the proposal, which he refused to pay.The complainant said their application was submitted to both Invest UP and online. However, before the application was presented to the evaluation committee, a “senior official in Invest UP” gave him the number of one Nikant Jain and told him if Jain recommended his project, it would be cleared immediately by the evaluation panel and state cabinet. Jain then made a demand of 5% of the project cost as commission and asked for the amount in cash in advance, a demand Datta said he rejected. Though the project went on to receive approval by the evaluation committee, it was not finally cleared. Datta stated in his complaint that Jain again told him that only he could help get this project cleared. Police arrested Jain Thursday.","Abhishek prakash, ceo of invest up and former district magistrate of lucknow, was suspended thursday following charges of irregularities in the evaluation process for a proposed solar manufacturing project.

Premeditated crime

Muskan Rastogi , accused of murdering and dismembering her husband, Saurabh Rajput, spent her first night in Chaudhary Charan Singh district jail in extreme distress, as per reports. She was placed in the women’s barrack while her lover and co-accused, Sahil Shukla, was lodged separately in the men’s section.According to senior jail superintendent Viresh Raj Sharma, Muskan remained completely silent upon arrival and refused to eat. Jail sources told news agency PTI that Muskan cried throughout the night.

Their court appearance turned chaotic when a group of enraged lawyers physically assaulted them outside the courtroom. Sahil's clothes were torn in the scuffle before police managed to intervene and escort them to safety.The dismembered body of Saurabh Rajput, which was found encased in cement inside a blue drum, was cremated late Wednesday evening after undergoing a post-mortem examination.Investigations revealed that Muskan and Sahil had a long-standing relationship, having reconnected in 2019 through a WhatsApp group of former schoolmates.

'Uddhav govt suppressed the case'

Opposition question timing



'Attempt to defame'

Salian's lawyer defends plea timing

NEW DELHI: A fresh plea in Disha Salian's death, filed by her father Satish Salian in the Bombay high court, has resurrected the political storm in Maharashtra as the new petition sought action against ex-minister Aaditya Thackeray Salian's father knocked on the doors of the high court alleging a cover-up by the Mumbai Police in the probe of Disha's death case, which was closely followed by the alleged suicide of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput for whom she worked as a manager.Satish Salian has expressed apprehension that Mumbai cops concluded Disha’s death as a case of suicide or accidental death without thoroughly considering forensic evidence, circumstantial proof, and eyewitness testimonies.The Salian family claimed the probe, which they initially suspected to be genuine, was a cover-up.In the petition, Disha's family has urged the high court to direct the registration of an FIR against Aaditya Thackeray and to transfer the probe to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).The Salian family's new legal recourse has blown up into a political hullabaloo, with the BJP leaders seeking action against Thackery and the Shiv Sena (UBT) netas dismissing the political rivals' remarks as a ""distraction"" and an ""attempt"" to malign Aaditya's image.BJP MLA Ameet Satam accused the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Agadhi (MVA) government of ""suppressing"" the Disha Salian's death case.''Salian's father has told the media that he suspects his daughter was gang-raped and murdered. He has filed a petition in the court. The previous MVA government suppressed the case. The then Mayor met him (Satish Salian), misled him, and pressurised him not to speak. He has said a minister in the previous MVA regime was involved. This is a serious allegation,'' Satam said according to the news agency PTI.""Powerful people and those born with silver spoons in their mouths should not be let off,'' Satam said, without naming anyone and demanded that ""those named should be arrested for custodial interrogation"".Building on Satam's charges, minister Nitesh Rane said that as per a Supreme Court judgement, a person against whom such allegations are made should be arrested immediately, and demanded to know whether ""the former minister"" will be arrested.Thackeray family's loyalist Sanjay Raut questioned the timing of the petition, saying the ""discussion is being created around that petition"" to douse off the Aurangzeb issue.""I don't know what is in the petition. But the time chosen for the petition is when the atmosphere in Maharashtra is heated over Aurangzeb. Some power is working behind the petitioner. All powers are behind them. Discussion is being created around that petition, leaving aside the Aurangzeb issue. There is no need to name the people who are behind this,"" Raut told ANI.Congress leader Bhai Jagtap also questioned the timing of the petition, however, he said it is the right of Disha's father to approach the court.""I don't know much. It is his right, he (Disha Salian's father) can go (to court) anytime. But my question is that if you feel that injustice has been done to you, if you feel that your case has not been presented properly, then there was an opportunity to appeal at that time; why did you not go at that time?"" Jagtap told ANI.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP-SCP) leader Rohit Pawar also attacked the BJP, accusing the party of politicising late actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death for elections and claimed that the party would do politics over Disha Salian after her father sought a probe into her death.Interestingly, Shiv Sena, which was part of Uddhav Sena before Eknath Shinde orchestrated a vertical split in 2022, appeared divided on the issue.While Shiv Sena legislators on Thursday staged a silent protest in the Vidhan Bhavan demanding a CBI probe into the Disha Salian death, the party MLA Sanjay Gaikwad urged political parties to refrain from 'politicising' the matter, asserting that reports on the case indicate the absence of any political angle.""The CID report shows that there isn't a political angle in this case. The police do not have solid proof of murder or rape in this case. I request all political parties not to indulge in such dirty politics,"" Gaikwad said.Aaditya Thackeray said on Thursday that there has been a continuous attempt to defame him for the last five years. Echoing Sanjay Raut's claim, Aaditya Thackeray said the matter was intentionally raked up to divert the attention of the people from critical issues, especially after the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) said that Aurangzeb's tomb is a not a relevant matter.""Where is Maharashtra being taken in terms of crimes? Women atrocities, farmer suicides, farmers distress, the situation of Maharashtra is getting worse. ""We have exposed the government on this and also on the Aurangzeb issue. A Minister had to resign (Dhananjay Munde resigned in connection with the Beed Sarpanch murder),"" Thackeray said.Advocate Nilesh C Ojha, representing Satish Salian, on Thursday made serious allegations against Aaditya Thackeray, referring to him as an ""accused"" in Disha's case. Ojha claimed that former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh was unwilling to take action against Thackeray. He also alleged that ""corrupt"" police officials attempted to cover up the case.""During the murder, Uddhav Thackeray's government was there (in Maharashtra), and the accused was his son Aaditya Thackeray. The corrupt police officials tried to cover up the case. After 2.5 years, Shinde's government came, and Fadnavis was the Home Minister. This matter has not come all of a sudden,"" Ojha told ANI.Ojha also clarified that the matter was not being raised ""suddenly"" and that the Shinde government had formed a State Investigation Team (SIT) in December 2023. A written complaint submitted in January 2024 also asked for an FIR to be registered.""In September 2023, we filed a PIL, which also raised the issue of registering an FIR and taking action. The state government formed an SIT in December 2023. A written complaint was also submitted on January 12, 2024, which asked for an FIR to be registered for gang rape and murder against Aaditya Thackeray, Sooraj Pancholi and others,"" he said. As this happened, Ojha said that Disha's father approached him to file the petition.","A fresh plea in disha salian's death, filed by her father satish salian in the bombay high court, has resurrected the political storm in maharashtra.

""I feel that there are some loopholes in the police probe. There could be more suspects. All suspects must be arrested,"" he asserted.

He was also well-built physically, so I don’t feel just two people could do this.""According to Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP South) Digant Anand, the crime was committed in a fit of rage when Dhannalal confronted his wife and her lover at Deendayal’s shop, where she worked.

NEW DELHI: The brutal murder of Merchant Navy officer Saurabh Rajput has sent shockwaves through Meerut, with his grieving family demanding the death penalty for his wife, Muskan Rastogi , and her alleged lover, Sahil Shukla. Saurabh’s mother, Renu Devi, accused Muskan of killing her husband, locking his body in a room, and then going on a trip as if nothing had happened.Saurabh had been missing since March 4. The horrific crime was exposed when laborers hired to move a heavy drum from the couple’s rented house struggled with its weight. When one of them questioned Muskan about its contents, she casually said it was ""house junk."" However, as they attempted to shift it, the lid accidentally opened, releasing a foul smell. Suspecting something sinister, the laborers immediately informed the police.According to Saurabh’s mother, even their young daughter might have been aware of the crime. “Neighbors told us that she (their daughter) was saying, ‘Papa has been kept in the drum.’ She might have seen something, or else why would a child say such a thing?” Renu Devi said.Police investigations revealed that Muskan and Sahil allegedly stabbed Saurabh to death, chopped up his body, and sealed the remains in a drum filled with cement to hide the crime. Muskan’s landlord had reportedly asked the couple to vacate the rented house, which is when she and Sahil attempted to shift the body.After the body was discovered, Muskan fled to her mother’s house, allegedly to inform them of what had happened. However, Saurabh’s mother claims Muskan’s family already knew about the murder. “She (Muskan) reached her mother’s house, and her mother met a lawyer before they went to court. They were trying to cover things up, but the police caught them,” Renu Devi said.Police arrested Muskan and Sahil on Tuesday and presented them before the court on Wednesday. They have been remanded to 14-day judicial custody.Meanwhile, Saurabh’s family is devastated, claiming he sacrificed everything for Muskan, only to be betrayed in the most gruesome manner. “Saurabh left his job and family for Muskan, but she took his life,” his parents said.Renu Devi recalled how Saurabh had distanced himself from his family after marrying Muskan. “I tolerated everything for the happiness of my son and daughter-in-law. Now, she has killed my son.”The grieving mother, overwhelmed with grief, demanded strict punishment. “They all (Muskan’s family) should be hanged along with that boy (Sahil),” she said.Meanwhile, Muskan’s own parents have disowned her, expressing deep remorse over her actions. “It would have been better if she was never born,” her mother, Kavita Rastogi, told reporters.Her father, Pramod Rastogi, called for the harshest punishment. “Muskan has lost the right to live. Such a person does not deserve to be alive. She fell in love with Sahil and got addicted to drugs. He destroyed her. She lost 10 kg because of drug use. But that does not justify this crime,” he said.Pramod and Kavita said that they fully support Saurabh’s family’s demand for justice. They confirmed that Muskan had been living separately from her in-laws since her marriage in 2016 due to ongoing disputes.","Merchant navy officer saurabh rajput was stabbed to death.

A securityman also died in the gunfight.Bastar range IG P Sundarraj told TOI that the bigger encounter was in Bijapur's Gangaloor, a hotbed of insurgency that has seen much bloodshed. This is the first major operation in Gangaloor after the March 3 surrender of Maoist commander Dinesh Modiyam, who called the shots in the area. As many as 26 of Modiyam's ex-comrades were killed in the encounter. The operations in Bijapur & Kanker - nearly 300km apart - were launched simultaneously.In just 80 days, 113 Maoists have been killed by security forces in Chhattisgarh - 91 of them in Bijapur.

Many Naxals were killed in two operations by our security forces in Chhattisgarh's Bijapur and Kanker. Modi govt is moving forward with a ruthless approach against Naxals, and despite various facilities for surrender and inclusion, it is adopting a zero-tolerance policy against those Naxals who refuse to surrender. The country is set to be Naxal-free by March 31 next year.""Sundarraj said a joint team of Bijapur and Sukma District Reserve Guards (DRG), CoBRA commandos and CRPF personnel set out on an operation in Gangaloor based on specific inputs about the presence of Maoists.The first exchange of fire took place around 7am and intermittent firing went on till after noon.When the guns fell silent, the forces found 26 dead Maoists scattered across the battleground.Police also rounded up a group of senior cadres in the forest, sources said, adding that the search is still under way.The body of DRG jawan Raju Oyam, who was killed in the encounter, has been evacuated.

Apples from Thar: Rajasthan farmers cultivate a taste of Himalayas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/apples-from-thar-raj-farmers-cultivate-a-taste-of-himalayas/articleshow/119276846.cms,"JAIPUR: The Thar in Rajasthan stretches duney and dry. Summer temperatures climb to a blistering 49°C. But the desert is changing. A fruit synonymous with the Himalayas has found an unexpected home in this sea of sand and scorching sun. Apples - red and ripe. What seemed impossible is now a flourishing reality for farmers in Sikar and Jhunjhunu districts, defying conventional wisdom about the fruit's need for cool climates.Santosh Khedar, a farmer from Beri village in Sikar, never imagined her small experiment would turn into a successful apple orchard. A single sapling given to her in 2015 by National Innovation Foundation in Gujarat has multiplied into a thriving apple farm yielding more than 6,000kg of fruit each season.""Since we have a certificate of organic farming from Rajasthan Organic Certification Agency, if the market price for apples from Himachal and Kashmir is Rs 100 a kg, we are selling it at Rs 150/kg,"" said Santosh's son Rahul, who studied agriculture, determined to ensure the family farm continued to thrive.The family had long grown lemon, guava, and sweet lime on their 1.25-acre farm, but an apple tree seemed like a fantasy. ""We were initially sceptical,"" Santosh said. ""We watered the plant and used organic fertilisers as needed. A year later, we saw apples growing on it.""Her neighbours laughed at the idea. Apples? Here? They shook their heads at the thought. But Santosh's tree did not care for their disbelief. In its second year, it bore nearly 40kg of fruit.The secret to this unexpected success lies in the HRMN-99 apple variety , specifically developed to withstand extreme temperatures. ""This variety can grow in arid regions where summer temperatures exceed 40°C,"" Rahul said. Encouraged by the results, Santosh and her family acquired more saplings and used grafting techniques to expand their orchard to 100 trees. ""Ab to paani bhi koni laage jyada (Now, we barely need extra water),"" she said.Apple trees require minimal irrigation once they mature. ""By the time the plant is five years old, it only needs watering once every two weeks,"" deputy director of horticulture Madan Lal Jat said. ""Flowering begins in Feb and the apples are ready for harvest by June.""Those who once scoffed at Santosh are now eager to follow in her footsteps. ""Jo manya konya ve ib podho maange hai,"" she said in her native dialect, meaning: ""Those who didn't believe now ask for a sapling."" In nearby Katrathal village, farmer Mohit Chaudhary has cultivated 50 apple trees. Horticulture official Jat sees a growing trend. ""Ten years ago, people in Barmer cultivated dates and pomegranates. Now, we have farmers growing strawberries in Chittorgarh and Bhilwara,"" he said. ""In five years, apple farming could spread across more regions,"" he said.","Santosh khedar, a farmer from beri village in sikar, never imagined her small experiment would turn into a successful apple orchard.

Supreme Court ruling set to ease govt land acquisition process,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-ruling-set-to-ease-govt-land-acquisition-process/articleshow/119276265.cms,"SC: Validating bid to nullify state’s land buy nothing short of permitting fraud

NEW DELHI: Frowning at vexatious litigation relating to land acquisition, which delays projects for decades, Supreme Court Thursday ruled that when a govt acquires land for public purposes using its sovereign powers, it cannot be frustrated by creation of third-party rights after the acquisition.A bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar said even a public body for whom an acquisition was done can't give the land to someone through a private agreement as only govt has the power to withdraw acquisition for the entire land, or a portion of it.Litigation relating to acquired land, mainly because of creation of third-party rights, has been a key factor for delay in execution of many projects, especially national highways.This ruling may help ease the impediments caused by post-acquisition litigation.The case that warranted the ruling pertained to acquisition of 33 acres abutting Narela-Bawana Road to enable Delhi Agricultural Marketing Board to establish its grain market. The acquisition notification was issued in Oct 30, 1963 and the award determining compensation issued on Jan 10, 1986. When a woman claimed ownership over a portion of the land, the Board chairman surreptitiously entered into a private agreement with her and agreed to release half of the claimed land to her while permitting her to claim compensation for the other half.Writing the judgment, Justice Kumar said the flow of events turned curiouser and curiouser as in 'Alice in Wonderland'. After the chairman's retirement, the Board disputed the agreement. But Delhi high court allowed the woman's plea for arbitration of the dispute with the Board relating to the acquired land. The arbitrator appointed by the HC ruled in favour of the woman and said the return of the land was valid.""When the state uses its sovereign power of eminent domain and acquires land for a public purpose, such an exercise cannot be set at naught by the beneficiary of such acquisition, the Board, by entering into a private agreement shortly after the acquisition so as to reverse the usage of the power of eminent domain by the state,"" Justice Kumar said. ""Validating this dubious enterprise by a statutory beneficiary of a compulsory acquisition would be nothing short of permitting a fraud on the exercise of such sovereign power by the state,"" he added.""Given the further fact that the only objective of the said agreement was to thwart the compulsory acquisition of the subject land by returning a portion thereof to Bhagwan Devi, the agreement was patently opposed to all tenets of law,"" the bench said while quashing the orders of the HC and the arbitral award.","Litigation relating to acquired land, mainly because of creation of third-party rights, has been a key factor for delay in execution of many projects, especially national highways.

Supreme Court's land rights order boost for infrastructure projects,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-courts-land-rights-order-boost-for-infrastructure-projects/articleshow/119274290.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court's ruling that creating third-party rights through private agreements in land parcels after acquisition is illegal is likely to provide a big boost to govt entities executing infrastructure projects in the highway, railways, irrigation and power sectors.Delay in land acquisition has been one of the biggest reasons for time and cost overruns of infrastructure projects. The process becomes more complex and time-taking when matters reach courts after landowners create third-party rights or all affected parties seek rehabilitation. The issue of land acquisition getting stuck or delayed has been flagged in several govt reports and even at the Pragati meetings chaired by PM Narendra Modi.""Once the land acquisition issue is resolved, projects can be put on fast-track mode.

""Our estimate was $2.5-3.5 million which we thought was fair, but this was a phenomenal work,"" says Nishad Avari, head of South Asian Modern and Contemporary Art at Christie's.""The only comparable work is Husain's Zameen, which is in the collection of the National Gallery of Modern Art in New Delhi,"" Avari adds.Husain, often known as India's barefoot Picasso, started his career as a hoarding painter, and like the Bollywood posters he painted, his story was quite filmy. It didn't have such a happy ending though as death threats and multiple lawsuits forced the artist into exile. ""This is a homecoming of sorts for Husain,"" says Yashodhara Dalmia, art historian and curator. A founding member of the Progressive Artists Group , Husain and his contemporaries gave Indian art a new modernist language post-Independence. ""Gram Yatra shows his modernist vocabulary and influences but is yet completely rooted in India. He spotlighted the ordinary Indian in the painting. You can see a farmer tilling the soil, a woman using a chakki to mill wheat and a couple strolling by.""Avari says his favourite panel is the farmer. ""The farmer is shown holding up the land - physically and metaphorically."" By choosing to highlight the farmer, Avari explains, the artist ""is forcing his viewers to focus on the foundational importance of rural India in the wake of the new nation, even as the country underwent urbanisation.""The painting, says Anand, realises Gandhi's vision . ""Gandhi said that India's soul lives in its villages and Husain captures that soul on canvas. His name is synonymous with Indian art."" But despite this fame, Anand admits that Husain's work has been relatively underpriced till now. ""When you compared the prices to his contemporaries, they were always lower, but this sale is going to change that.""Perhaps it will encourage many Indians, who have been holding on to sketches and paintings that the flamboyant and ever-generous Husain saab gifted to them, to bring out their bounty.","Mf husain gram yatra fetched a record price of $3.5 million at christie's auction.

After much suspense, the doctor offered Husain a princely sum of Rs 1,000 for the painting. That, says Avari, was a record price for a work of Indian art then.
