SC makes granting sand-mining leases more difficult,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-makes-granting-sand-mining-leases-more-difficult/articleshow/123491912.cms,"NEW DELHI: In an important judgment, the Supreme Court has linked quantum of sand mining to the river's replenishment capacity, a ruling that would prevent degradation of riverbeds, consequently making grant of leases for extraction of a key construction raw material from riverbanks difficult.Taking the regulatory regime for sand mining a step forward, a bench of Justices P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar said extraction of sand from riverbeds must be in sync with the river's capacity to replenish, akin to felling of timber in a forest being linked to its capacity to grow trees.The bench said, ""Just as forest conservation requires assessment of tree growth rate before permitting timber harvesting to ensure that felling of trees does not exceed tree growth, a replenishment study enables us to take an informed decision as to whether sand mining can be permitted without degrading the rivers' natural balance.""The Justice Narasimha-led bench mentioned its judgment earlier this year declaring that a valid and subsisting District Survey Report (DSR) is mandatory for grant of environmental clearance (EC) for sand mining. ""The purpose and objective of preparing such District Survey Report is to scientifically locate the place for sand mining after calculation of annual rate of replenishment for allowing mining in the area,"" it said.""It is, therefore, compelling to hold that a DSR is valid and tenable only when a proper replenishment study is conducted,"" the bench said, adding that absence of a replenishment study renders a DSR fundamentally defective.This ruling came from the bench while dismissing appeals by the J&K govt and the National Highways Authority of India, which had challenged a National Green Tribunal order setting aside the permission for sand mining, without a proper replenishment study, to a project proponent which awarded the construction of a four-lane bypass-ring-road around Srinagar city.","Justices p s narasimha and a s chandurkar said extraction of sand from riverbeds must be in sync with the river's capacity to replenish.

Adlam, 60, was in India from Feb 24 to 28 on a tourist visa.The court's three-page order quotes Sharma, a former lieutenant commander of the Indian Navy, as terming the alleged breach ""a threat to national security"".The ordnance factory recently received ""brake parachute technology transfer"" for Sukhoi Su-30 aircraft, and contributes to space projects like Gaganyaan and drone development.Deputy general manager Himmatlal Kumawat, a 2011-batch Indian Ordnance Factory Services officer, stands accused of trying to pressure Sharma into allowing Adlam to visit the facility by bypassing the mandatory security clearance.The complaint names another official of the same rank, Vipin Kathiyar, as siding with Kumawat.When Sharma didn't relent, Kumawat allegedly facilitated Adlam's unauthorised tour without his knowledge. The DGM had allegedly assaulted Sharma in his office on Feb 21 after an argument over the foreigner's planned visit. The court document states that witnesses, including a security guard and a contract worker, intervened to separate the duo.The alleged breach occurred barely two weeks before UP Police's Anti-Terrorist Squad arrested Ravindra Kumar, a chargeman who reported to Kumawat at the factory. Ravindra was arrested on March 14 for allegedly using his smartphone to share classified documents with a suspected ISI agent.An internal investigation revealed that Himmatlal and Vipin had previously allowed staff to use smartphones inside the facility in violation of security protocol.CJM Diwakar said during a hearing on Aug 8 that entry into a defence facility without authorisation was a cognisable offence. He directed police to register an FIR and submit the findings of the investigation within 24 hours.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The main accused in the Greater Noida dowry death case, Vipin Bhati, has been sent to judicial custody for 14 days, police said on Sunday. Bhati was arrested earlier in the day after being shot in the leg while attempting to escape from custody.Hours later, police also arrested his mother, who is accused of playing a key role in the alleged murder of Nikki Bhati, Vipin’s wife. Confirming the arrest, the DCP, Greater Noida, said, “One more accused has been arrested in the murder case. The deceased’s mother-in-law has also been arrested.”Nikki’s father, Bhikhari Singh Payla, welcomed the arrests but voiced his anguish. “The administration is working well. The monsters burnt her to death… I am happy that she (victim's mother-in-law) has been arrested. She is behind the entire conspiracy. It is a mother’s work to educate the child. Instead of disciplining him, she encouraged him (the victim’s husband) further. They must be hanged,” he said.Payla alleged that Nikki’s mother-in-law poured kerosene on her while Vipin set her ablaze. “They demanded a car and tortured my daughter.Now their demands have been met with her death,” he said during a protest outside Kasna Police Station.Nikki, who had suffered 70% burn injuries, died at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital. Her family claims she was repeatedly harassed for dowry. Vipin, however, denied any role in her death, saying from his hospital bed, “I have no remorse. I haven’t killed her… Husband and wife often have fights, it is very common.”The victim’s father described his son-in-law as “a butcher,” recalling how Nikki had once been brought home due to domestic violence but was later sent back after assurances from her in-laws. “It continued. Now they have got what they wanted,” he said.Police said further investigation into the case is underway.",Vipin bhati sent to judicial custody for 14 days in dowry death case.

"Cleanliness in toilets & coach, major irritants for long-distance train passengers: CAG audit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cleanliness-in-toilets-coach-major-irritants-for-long-distance-train-passengers-cag-audit/articleshow/123489089.cms,"The findings are based on a detailed survey of 2,426 on-board passengers across 96 selected trains, conducted by audit offices from 16 zones.

NEW DELHI: In a telling indicator of the persistent cleanliness issues on long-distance trains — from choked toilets and unclean washbasins to lack of water and dirty vestibule areas — an audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has found that over 40% of passengers were dissatisfied with toilet cleanliness, while more than half expressed dissatisfaction with on-board housekeeping.The findings are based on a detailed survey of 2,426 on-board passengers across 96 selected trains, conducted by audit offices from 16 zones. The results are a part of the CAG’s report titled “Cleanliness and Sanitation in Long Distance Trains” for 2018-19 to 2022-23 period.However, the auditor noted that 89% of complaints related to toilet cleanliness were addressed within the stipulated time frame, indicating a degree of responsiveness.The audit has highlighted inadequate deployment of manpower and cleaning equipment, along with poor and irregular monitoring by railway officials, as key reasons behind the poor sanitary conditions on long-distance trains.According to the report, bio-toilets in AC coaches were found to be in better condition than those in non-AC coaches. Passenger dissatisfaction exceeded 50% in five zones, including East Coast, Western, and Eastern Railways.In contrast, satisfaction levels crossed 90% in Northern and North Central Railways.Identifying improper usage as a major contributing factor, the CAG recommended “special efforts to raise passenger awareness regarding the proper use of bio-toilets, especially in cases involving non-availability of water or filth in common areas such as near sinks.”On the issue of water availability, the audit surveyed six selected trains in each zone and recorded passenger feedback. Out of the 2,426 passengers surveyed, 366 (15%) reported lack of water in toilets or washbasins. The report also noted that over one lakh complaints regarding water shortages in train toilets and washbasins were registered via the Rail Madad app in 2022-23.To address this, the CAG recommended ensuring enroute water refilling arrangements, especially for long-distance trains and at stations which recorded more frequent complaints.For the assessment of On-Board Housekeeping Services (OBHS), joint inspections were conducted along with railway officials on 15 trains. Service deficiencies were found in 13 of them, which included choked washbasins at doorways, dirty lavatories in sleeper coaches, waterlogging in toilets, and unclean vestibule areas.The audit also reviewed the performance of the Clean Train Stations (CTS) scheme, introduced to provide mechanised cleaning of key coach areas, such as bio-toilets, doorways and vestibules, during brief halts at enroute stations. The report stated that the intended benefits of the scheme were not fully realised due to railway authorities failing to enforce contractual obligations, including the deployment of adequate resources within the scheduled halt time.During joint inspections of 29 CTS across 12 zones, the audit observed limited cleaning of toilets and other areas, and shortfall in usage of machines and deployment of manpower.The report also flagged how the authorities at zonal level failed to ensure compliance with the norm of police verification of contractual staff deployed on trains despite several instances of crime involving such staff having been reported, including rape of a passenger by an attendant on Delhi-Ahmedabad Swarna Jayanti Rajdhani train.","The findings are based on a detailed survey of 2,426 on-board passengers across 96 selected trains.

The accused, a 27-year-old driver with a ride-hailing company, throttled his 21-year-old wife following frequent quarrels over family disputes.To hide the crime, he had cut the body into pieces with a hexa blade. He threw the head, hands, and legs into the Musi river at Prathapsingaram, and kept the trunk without the head and legs in his room, DCP (Malkajgiri Zone) P V Padmaja told reporters.The accused packed the body parts separately in plastic covers and made three trips to the river to dump them. Later, he called his sister claiming his wife had gone missing. When his sister grew suspicious and informed a relative, he was taken to a police station, PTI reported.He again tried to portray the murder as a missing incident, but during questioning he confessed to killing his wife, the DCP said.A case has been registered under relevant BNS sections for murder and causing disappearance of evidence, and the accused is now in custody.The remains were recovered from the house and sent for post-mortem.“We have to ascertain the deceased (is wife of the accused) and a DNA test will be conducted,” Padmaja added.Asked about the recovery of the missing body parts, she said teams of NDRF personnel and GHMC swimmers have launched searches, but nothing has been found so far.Police revealed that both the accused and the victim were from Vikarabad district and had been neighbours before marrying through a love-cum-arrange marriage in January 2024 at Arya Samaj. They moved to Hyderabad and lived in a rented house in Boduppal.However, after a month of living together, disputes began.In April 2024, the woman lodged a complaint of domestic violence with Vikarabad police, following which a case was registered. Elders later intervened and the matter was settled in a village panchayat.The woman briefly worked at a call centre in Punjagutta but was forced to quit by her husband, who suspected her movements. She became pregnant in March 2025, but quarrels continued.On August 22, she told her husband she wanted to visit Vikarabad for a medical check-up and then stay with her parents. He refused, an argument broke out, and she abused him.

Political Row Erupts After Rahul Gandhi’s Convoy ‘Crushes’ Cop During Vote Adhikar Yatra

NEW DELHI: In a light-hearted remark, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday joked that “talks are on” with RJD chief Lalu Prasad regarding his earlier suggestion that the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha should get married.The 55-year-old made the comment at a press conference in Araria district during the ongoing ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’. Gandhi noted that he had received a similar suggestion from Lalu Prasad two years ago.The comment dates back to a press conference in Patna two years ago, where Lalu Prasad humorously urged Gandhi to get married, saying it was a wish of his mother, Sonia Gandhi , and that they wanted to see him as a ‘dulha’ (groom) and join the ‘baraat'.Gandhi’s remark came after RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav had suggested to Union minister Chirag Paswan that he should consider getting married.During the press conference, a journalist asked Yadav about Paswan’s attempts to portray the Congress as a “pichhlaggu” (sidekick) of the RJD.Yadav, the INDIA bloc’s chief ministerial candidate, responded humorously, saying he could mock Paswan’s claims of being a “Hanuman” for Prime Minister Narendra Modi , but he preferred not to take issue with him, whom he regards as an elder brother.“I would only advise him to get married. It is high time,” Yadav said, drawing laughter from the audience.Rahul Gandhi, who is often referred to by Yadav as ‘bade bhai’ during the Yatra, then remarked, “The advice is applicable to me as well.

To this, CJI said, ""It is not 'many'. Every decision of the judge, which was challenged in SC, had been overturned.

NEW DELHI: A man, inspired by the Bollywood movie ""Sholay,"" tried to reminisce the iconic water tanker scene by climbing a mobile tower in a Bhadohi village on Sunday, threatening to jump unless his “girlfriend” was brought to him for marriage.The man, identified as Pawan Pandey, ran a paan shop on the city’s main road. The standoff between Pandey and the police and firefighters lasted nearly five hours, as authorities tried to rescue him safely.Circle Officer Ashok Kumar Mishra said, ""Pandey runs a paan shop on the city's main road, and he climbed the tower near Yakubpur at around 9 am. From the top, he shouted for a woman named Khushbu and insisted she be brought to the site or he would jump.""Despite repeated attempts to locate the woman, police found no trace of her. Eventually, they had a female staff member pose as Khushbu over the phone, which successfully persuaded Pandey to descend from the tower around 2 pm.Further investigation revealed that Pandey had been communicating for two years with someone using a fake Instagram profile. Authorities said that the person behind the account had used a woman’s photograph to gain Pandey’s trust and allegedly obtained money from him under the pretext of a romantic relationship.""Pandey told us he wanted to marry Khushbu and believed people were trying to keep them apart,"" Mishra explained. ""However, it turned out to be a case of online fraud. Someone used a fake ID to impersonate a woman and extract money from him.""Police have filed a case against Pandey for causing public disturbance, while investigations into the online fraud continue.","The man, identified as pawan pandey, ran a paan shop on the city’s main road.

""""Academicians, lecturers and professors are the intellectual backbone of any nation, as they dedicate their lives to shaping the minds and character of future generations.

To address this shortage and to ensure continuity of academic activities, state govt has resorted to ad hoc and contractual appointments.

'SC Inciting Religious Wars': Nishikant Dubey EXPLODES On Supreme Court Over Waqf Scrutiny

NEW DELHI: After focusing for decades on ensuring fair trial to accused persons and their unfettered right to appeal against conviction, Supreme Court in a significant interpretation of criminal law has conferred similar rights on victims of crime, and even their legal heirs, to challenge acquittals.Till now, in the case of acquittal of an accused by trial court or high court, either the state or complainant had the right to file an appeal. A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan last week extended the right to appeal against acquittal of accused to two more categories of people - those who suffered injury or losses in the crime and legal heirs of victims of the crime.Writing the 58-page precedent-setting judgment, Justice Nagarathna said, ""The right of a victim of a crime must be placed on par with the right of an accused who has suffered a conviction, who, as a matter of right, can prefer an appeal under Section 374 of CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure).""""We find the victim has every right to prefer an appeal as against a conviction for a lesser offence or for imposing inadequate compensation or even in the case of an acquittal ...as stated in the proviso to Sec 372 of CrPC,"" the bench said.Threading analogous SC judgments and law commission reports, the bench concluded that the right of victims of crime to file appeal in a higher court against acquittal of the accused, or award of lenient punishment ""cannot be circumscribed"".The bench expanded the ambit of ""victims of crime"" for the purpose of filing an appeal and said their legal heirs could continue prosecution of such appeals in case the appellant-victim dies during the pendency of appeals.Also read - Treaty binds Russia to provide information on woman’s whereabouts: SC ""A person convicted of a crime has the right to prefer an appeal under Section 374 of the CrPC as a matter of right and not being subjected to any conditions. Similarly, a victim of a crime, whatever be the nature of the crime, must have a right to prefer an appeal as per the CrPC,"" she said. Justices Nagarathna and Viswanathan said if the victims of an offence had the right to appeal against acquittal or lesser punishment awarded to the accused, then their legal heirs would have identical right to prosecute the appeal if after filing of the appeal, the injured person dies.SC said in the event of acquittal of accused, the state through the public prosecutor can file an appeal with permission of the appellate court even if the complainant does not challenge the acquittal.""It is not always that the State or a complainant would prefer an appeal. But when it comes to a victim's right to prefer an appeal, the insistence on seeking special leave to appeal from the HC under Section 378(4) of the CrPC would be contrary to what has been intended by the Parliament by insertion of the proviso to Section 372 of the CrPC,"" it further said. ""Hence, the statutory rigours for filing of an appeal by the State or by a complainant against an order of acquittal cannot be read into the proviso to Section 372 of the CrPC so as to restrict the right of a victim to file an appeal on the grounds mentioned therein, when none exists,"" SC said.","Supreme court in a significant interpretation of criminal law has conferred similar rights on victims of crime, and even their legal heirs. Justices b v nagarathna and k v viswanathan extended the right to appeal against acquittal of accused to two more categories of people.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123490281,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-921445,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
