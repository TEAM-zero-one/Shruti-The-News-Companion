"Ignoring own orders, Supreme Court has kept case in limbo since 2018",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ignoring-own-orders-supreme-court-has-kept-case-in-limbo-since-2018/articleshow/125358475.cms,"NEW DELHI: It is a classic case of how Supreme Court does not follow its own rulings. While it has repeatedly held any stay order in criminal matters should not continue for an unduly long time, its stay order on a CBI probe into poaching of animals in Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) has been in operation for the last seven years.Now, the apex court has agreed to hear a plea filed by an environmentalist from Uttarakhand seeking lifting of stay to allow CBI to complete its probe which had suggested ""connivance of forest officers/officials with poachers"". Interestingly, CBI has also filed an application for vacation of order in which it mentioned the findings of a preliminary inquiry conducted by it.In this case, HC had in Sept 4, 2018 ordered a CBI probe into all poaching cases in the state in the past five years and to find out the ""complicity, involvement or collusion"" of serving forest department officials in these incidents after the court was informed that 40 tigers and 272 leopards have died in the state in the last two-and-half years. But the HC order was stayed by SC on Oct 22 of the same year, when it passed an ex-parte order on an appeal filed by a retired principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) and chief wildlife warden of the state D S Khati.Appearing before a bench headed by CJI B R Gavai, advocate Govind Jee, representing environmentalist Atul Sati, mentioned the case and pleaded for early hearing. Agreeing with his plea, SC posted the hearing to Nov 17.The petitioner alleged HC passed the order after considering scientific reports submitted by Wildlife Institute of India and Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, and the prolonged stay has effectively stymied chances of detecting and dismantling the transnational, as well as trans state network, which was behind the poaching of tigers.Records of the case show that CBI also filed an application in 2023 for vacation of the order, and also mentioned the findings of its one-month probe before the stay order was passed by SC. The agency said it found various irregularities, including a deliberate attempt made by forest officials to cover up the death of a tiger.Referring to a case in which meat and skin of tiger and leopard were recovered, CBI said, ""During inquiry by CBI of this case, photocopy of case records, as made available by the forest department have been scrutinised and 38 persons including forest officials, private persons and accused persons have been examined. CBI inquiry suggests the connivance of forest officers/officials with poachers."" It said the guidelines issued by National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in respect of death were not being followed in Corbett.""During inquiry, prima-facie connivance of officers/officials of forest department of Uttarakhand has emerged in some cases. Gross negligence of guidelines of NTCA by officers/officials of forest department was also seen,"" it said in its report.""It is further submitted that the direction for a preliminary inquiry by CBI was passed by HC only after perusing the entire record, including the technical reports of Wildlife Institute of India, the report of the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, and the communication issued by the head of forest force, Uttarakhand, all of which clearly indicate accountability of senior forest officials including the petitioner (Khati) himself, and in view of transnational as well as interstate nature of network of tiger poaching involved in the matter. The order, therefore, was a reasoned judicial determination founded on cogent material and appreciating the urgency, gravity as well as geographical spread of a network of tigers poachers, aimed to eliminate/ mitigate any future threat to safety of tigers,"" the petition filed by Sati, said.","Supreme court has agreed to hear a plea filed by an environmentalist from uttarakhand. He is seeking lifting of stay to allow cbi to complete its probe which had suggested ""connivance of forest officers/officials with poachers"" cbi has also filed an application for vacation of order in which it mentioned findings of a preliminary inquiry conducted by it.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125358491,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1425279,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

PM Modi Predicts Major Congress Split After NDA’s Bihar Win And Warns Allies Of Growing Instability

PM Lauds EC; 'Zero appeals' validated rolls revision: CEC

NEW DELHI: The smooth and peaceful conduct of Bihar assembly elections with the highest-ever turnout of voters, particularly after the first SIR of its electoral roll in over two decades, will boost the confidence of EC as it goes about Phase 2 of SIR across a dozen other states and UTs, including those due for assembly polls next year.The overwhelming participation of electors in SIR and then in Bihar elections is seen as a clear indication that the 'vote chori' campaign of opposition, led by Congress and amplified by Rahul Gandhi through his 'Vote Adhikar Yatra' in state, press conferences and personal attacks against CEC Gyanesh Kumar did not find resonance with the public. The assessment is reinforced by Congress' modest six-seat tally in the polls.Even Supreme Court had refused to entertain the opposition parties and activists' pleas to stay and quash SIR in Bihar, based on their fear that it would disenfranchise electors from weaker sections and minorities. The high participation of these very sections in Bihar polls has undermined their argument.PM Narendra Modi, in his victory speech on Friday, said that high voting in Bihar, particularly by the weaker sections, is a huge achievement for EC, as is the elimination of repolls that were synonymous with elections during the 'jungle raj' era in the state.""I congratulate EC, poll-related officers, security forces and electors for this,"" said PM Modi. He also underlined that the electors of Bihar, particularly the youth, had shown that they took SIR with utmost seriousness. ""For purity of democracy, every vote matters,"" he said while exhorting the party apparatus at the polling station level to contribute 100% to SIR in other states/UTs.Speaking to TOI, CEC Gyanesh Kumar said: ""Zero appeals against the final electoral roll of Bihar, not a single request for repoll from the 2,616 candidates or 12 recognised parties and highest polling since Bihar's first election in 1951 show the precision and commitment with which EC and its ground machinery worked to deliver a free, fair and peaceful election. This, for EC, is the biggest validation"".Kumar was personally targeted in comments by Rahul Gandhi and AI-generated campaigns on Congress' social media. But EC cited relevant provisions of law to validate its actions and directives. Transparency at each stage of SIR - enumeration, claims and objections, and their disposal - with daily bulletins and fact-checks ensured a direct line with the electors, who willingly participated in SIR and ensured that all deadlines were met.","The smooth and peaceful conduct of bihar assembly elections with the highest-ever turnout of voters will boost the confidence of ec. The overwhelming participation of electors in sir and then in bihar elections is seen as a clear indication that the 'vote chori' campaign of opposition, led by congress, did not find resonance with the public.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125358165,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-86928,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Judge holds 3am court at home to send laundering accused to ED custody,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judge-holds-3am-court-at-home-to-send-laundering-accused-to-ed-custody/articleshow/125358054.cms,"Realtor running 'nationwide laundering scam', says ED

NEW DELHI: It was not the sort of work that is associated with state machinery. The court of additional sessions judge Shefali Barnala Tandon (of the Patiala House courts) was convened at her residence around 3 am on Friday to remand a person accused of money laundering, Swaraj Singh Yadav, in ED's custody.Yadav, who is the promoter of Ocean Seven Buildtech Pvt Ltd, is accused of illegally selling PM Awas Yojana flats in Gurgaon in all-cash transactions.After a daylong search, Yadav was held by the agency before midnight on Thursday. ED's move came in connection with the alleged laundering of more than Rs 222 crore of funds generated from illegal sale of apartments meant for the poor under PM Awas Yojana.These were sold at an inflated price of Rs 40-50 lakh each to new buyers by cheating the original allottees whose allotment was cancelled, with not even their deposits being refunded. The original cost of a flat was Rs 26.5 lakh.Using these funds, ED said, the accused acquired personal assets, including 500 acres at Ware village in Maharashtra, 100 acres on Pune-Alibag Road, Sai Rupa Resorts in Tirthan Valley in Himachal Pradesh and land in Boston (US), besides financial assets in the UK.""The search for the arrestee started at 6.55 am, and he has to be produced before the court within 24 hours of the search, as per the guidelines of Supreme Court and various high courts,"" the ED submitted before the judge while producing the accused ""at this odd hour"" at her residence.The legal counsel of the accused was still on his way when the court began its proceedings at 3.05 am, and by the time the hearings from both the sides concluded, it was 6.30 am. The judge remanded the accused in ED's custody till Nov 28, when he is to be produced again. Not taking a chance, the judge specifically instructed that the accused be brought before the court at 2 pm on that day.The ED accused Yadav of committing ""a nationwide money laundering scam since 2006, duping thousands of buyers in Mumbai, Jaipur, Kotputli and Gurugram"". As per FIRs registered against him with the Delhi police, an estimated Rs 222 crore of homebuyers' money was siphoned by the accused after layering them through a related ""in-house construction agency"".""The concerted and accelerated liquidation of both personal and company-held assets by arrestee Swaraj Singh Yadav in the recent past strongly indicates his intent to dispose of the proceeds of crime and escape action under provisions of law. The investigation records confirm the urgent disposal of assets and liquidation of funds in anticipation of legal action. He had already sold a flat in Jalvayu Vihar in Gurugram, 40 acres of land in Borgaon, Maharashtra, and 15 acres in Jaipur,"" the ED said.""This coincides with his wife Sunita Swaraj relocating to the US in Aug 2025,"" the agency added and brought to the notice of the court the fact that the accused had transferred huge amounts to the US via a bank account of his wife's in Bank of Baroda.With his children pursuing graduation from Trinity College, Connecticut, US, there is every possibility of his fleeing from justice, the agency said.",Swaraj singh yadav is the promoter of ocean seven buildtech pvt ltd.

‘Very Bleak Message To World’: South Africa Envoy Condemns Delhi Blast And Seeks Joint Action

NEW DELHI: Dr Umer Un Nabi, the bomber behind the Nov 10 blast near Red Fort, had set up a laboratory at his house near the Al-Falah University in Faridabad, where he would test various kinds of explosives and try out the bomb-making techniques shared with him by his Pakistani handlers via Telegram.Sources close to the investigation told TOI that he possibly put together the ""loosely assembled"" improvised explosive device (IED) responsible for the Red Fort car blast at this home laboratory.The laboratory with all the testing equipment and traces of various kinds of explosives was unearthed during the raid on Umer's house. The information on Dr Umer's house as well as the IED testing and bomb making laboratory installed there is said to have come during the questioning of the arrested doctors of the Faridabad-based Jaish module, most likely Muzammil Ganaie.As reported by TOI on Friday, Dr Umer and two other doctors accused in the ‘white collar' terror case – Dr Muzammil and Dr Adeel Rather – were directly in touch with three Pakistani Jaish handlers Faisal, Hashim and Ukasha via encrypted messaging platform, Telegram.The handlers were passing on instructions, radicalisation videos and bomb-making DIY videos to the trio via Telegram chat. Agencies believe that Dr Umer was the bomb-making expert among the three, which is why he had set up a laboratory at his home.He would work there, mostly alone, to put together the IEDs as per instructions in the DIY videos and also test the chemicals to be employed as explosives and the triggering mechanisms to maximise the potency of the bomb being assembled.Two major batches of explosives, weighing 358 kg and 2,563 kg each, were recovered from two separate houses in Faridabad during raids between Nov 8 and 10. Indicating that the bombs were yet to be assembled, the explosives were found packed in suitcases and bags, with no metal pieces, usually used as shrapnel to maximise injury, being found.Sources said a possible link between the Delhi car blast, which agencies believe was triggered by accident, and the ""accidental"" explosion at Nowg-am police station on Friday night, may be examined.","Dr umer un nabi, the bomber behind the nov 10 blast near red fort, had set up a laboratory at his house near the al-falah university in faridabad.

Kishor would at best be a spoiler, many of his critics had said

NEW DELHI: Prashant Kishor 's Jan Suraaj Party lost its deposit in 236 of the 238 seats that it contested but data suggests it may have played spoiler in quite a few seats, reports Atul Thakur. In 35 constituencies, the party's votes were higher than the winning margin. NDA won 19 of these seats while 14 went to Mahagathbandhan. AIMIM and BSP each won one of these seats.Of course, the fact that Jan Suraaj got more votes than the margin in a seat does not necessarily mean it made the difference to the outcome since there is no way of knowing where those votes would otherwise have gone.The party came third in 115 seats and in one, Marhaura, it finished second.Of the 35 seats, within NDA, JDU, Kishor's former party, won 10 of these seats while BJP won five. The tally was three for LJP-RV and one for RLM.In the MGB camp, RJD was the winner in nine of these seats while Congress won two. One seat each went to CPM, CPIML-L and IIP.Despite his amplified presence on the social media, many critics of the party had claimed that Prashant Kishor would at best be a spoiler.Some felt his upper caste identity meant he would cut into BJP's vote while others argued he would divide the anti-incumbency youth votes since he was talking about issues like migration from the state.","Jan suraaj party lost its deposit in 236 of the 238 seats that it contested.

NDA Sweeps Bihar, Nitish Kumar Prepares for 10th CM Oath; A Look Back at ‘Sushasan Babu’s’ Journey





Behind-the scenes build-up





2025: Outgrowing the dependency narrative





Will Nitish continue as CM?





Nitish: The constant switch





The psychologist shift





From outsider to power centre





NEW DELHI: Amit Shah's pre-poll boast - ""We will win more than 160 seats... It can be 180 also"" - sounded-like a typical campaign bravado, the verdict proved otherwise. The NDA did not just meet expectations. It blew past them, finishing at 202 seats. With this sweeping mandate, one storyline stood above all: the BJP emerged as the single largest party in Bihar, securing 89 seats - its highest tally ever in the state assembly.This rise has taken decades to shape. For years, Bihar was defined by the dominance of socialist and Mandal-era forces led by leaders like Lalu Prasad Yadav and later Nitish Kumar. The BJP, despite expanding nationally, had little organic ground in the state. It lacked historical roots, caste-led influence and a natural voter identity in a state where politics was built more on community loyalties than ideology.So the party chose patience.The BJP stayed behind the scenes and allowed Nitish Kumar -- the face of ""sushasan babu"" -- to remain the mascot of reform and governance. While Nitish held the chair and the credit, the BJP quietly built its booth networks, expanded OBC outreach, infiltrated and weakened RJD's voter base, and steadily infused ideological presence into a state long driven by personality-centric politics revolving around Lalu and Nitish.BJP's social engineering strategy in Bihar, largely driven under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , appears to have paid off -- including in the Muslim-dominated Seemanchal region, where voters did not hesitate to support the BJP-NDA alliance.The Muslim electorate, traditionally seen as outside BJP's fold and often viewed as a disadvantage for the saffron party, showed a noticeable shift this time.The real inflection came in 2020, when the BJP, for the first time, outscored its senior ally JD(U), winning 74 seats compared to JD(U)'s 43. Yet it still supported Nitish as chief minister, signalling endurance over instant glory.This election made the transformation official. During seat negotiations, the BJP secured 101 seats, the same as JD(U), positioning itself as an equal partner and ending the long-held narrative of Nitish-led JD(U) as the ""big brother."" The results confirmed what the groundwork had hinted at: the BJP had outgrown its dependency narrative.However, Nitish Kumar also made an impressive comeback -- rising from 43 seats in the previous election to 85 this time, just behind the BJP. Yet his indispensability may not look the same anymore. With its partners, the NDA nearly touches majority on its own: the BJP's 89 seats, LJP (RV)'s 19, HAM's 5 and RLM's 4 total 117 seats, only a few short of the required majority. The remaining gap could potentially be bridged through talks with nine Independent candidates who are not aligned with either camp.A big question now emerges over who will be projected as the chief ministerial face for the BJP, especially when it comes to placing complete trust in Nitish Kumar - a leader who has built an unmatched reputation for switching sides, often described as practising ""weatherproof politics.""Over the past decade, he has moved between alliances with a precision almost unique in Indian politics. He walked out of the BJP in 2013 just as Narendra Modi was rising on the national stage, partnered with the RJD to form a grand alliance, switched back to the BJP, returned to the RJD camp, and then again shifted to the NDA. The pace and timing of these shifts have kept observers guessing for years.It was Nitish who first worked toward bringing opposition parties together under what eventually became the INDIA bloc. But before the idea could fully mature, he stepped away and returned to the NDA. This is why a familiar phrase keeps resurfacing in Bihar's political chatter: ""Nitish sabke hain."" Today, once again, he stands with the NDA to take on the very bloc he helped shape.Despite these repeated shifts, the BJP has usually not pressed hard on trust issues with JD(U), largely because Nitish’s ""sushasan babu"" image has been politically valuable in Bihar. Even after outscoring JD(U) in 2020, the BJP continued to back Nitish as chief minister. But now, with greater strength and momentum, a new question arises: will the BJP once again settle for a secondary role, or assert itself and claim the lead?When asked who would be chief minister, Amit Shah kept the answer open: ""Who am I to decide it? NDA partners will decide who will be the next Bihar CM."" Although the NDA publicly supports Nitish Kumar, the BJP has avoided formally projecting him as its chief ministerial face, keeping room for negotiation.Nitish Kumar's political shifts -- from BJP to RJD and back, then back again -- may have generated headlines, but beneath those dramatic alliance flips, the BJP was slowly becoming indispensable to Bihar’s power structure. Nitish remained the face, but BJP became the framework.The turning point is not just numerical; it is psychological. For decades, Bihar politics revolved around the Lalu-Nitish axis. Today, it revolves around the BJP’s bargaining weight. The Mahagathbandhan’s collapse, especially RJD’s reduction to 25 seats and Congress winning only 6 out of 61 it contested, underlined that shift.BJP veteran Lal Krishna Advani, who was arrested in Samastipur during his iconic Ram Mandir ""Rath Yatra"" on the orders of then-chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav -- a moment can be viewed as Bihar unwelcoming of the BJP. Now, the saffron party stands in sharp contrast to the party's present position, where it holds the strongest hand inside the state's ruling coalition. This transformation marks one of the most significant slow-burn political realignments in recent political history.In the end, Bihar 2025 isn't just about who will be chief minister. It’s about who now shapes the state’s political centre of gravity. And for the first time in three decades, that person may no longer be Nitish Kumar -- but the BJP itself.","Bjp's social engineering strategy in bihar, largely driven under the leadership of prime minister narendra modi, appears to have paid off. The muslim electorate, traditionally seen as outside bjp's fold, showed a noticeable shift this time. Nitish kumar also made an impressive comeback -- rising from 43 seats in the previous election to 85 this time, just behind the bjp.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125349669,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1222098,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The special cell of Delhi Police has filed an FIR to probe what it claimed was a deeper conspiracy in connection with the car blast near Red Fort.The first FIR registered under UAPA was transferred to NIA. The special cell has invoked sections of criminal conspiracy in this FIR and will reportedly make arrests soon.The blast was so powerful that the ground nearby shook, intelligence sources said on Friday, citing fresh CCTV footage of underground areas of Red Fort metro station. It shows the entire station experiencing a significant tremor causing goods on a cart to shake and rattle. The footage also reveals widespread chaos as panic-stricken commuters run for safety.Explosive experts who picked up samples from the spot are yet to give their report detailing the nature of the bomb, though police maintain Umar Un Nabi, who was behind the wheel when the car blew up, possibly used military grade explosives.Sleuths examined new CCTV footage of the route taken by Umar. “While travelling on Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, he stopped near a dhaba but didn’t eat anything and slept in his car, the footage shows.On the day of the explosion, Umar stopped at a small shop in Wazirpur and had tea. He was there for around 15 minutes but didn’t talk to anyone,” said a cop.Meanwhile, two doctors were detained for questioning from Haryana’s Nuh district on Thursday night, sources said. One of them pursued an MBBS course from China and recently finished an internship at Al-Falah University. Police informed his family that he was detained for questioning after he allegedly talked to some terror suspects.Suspicious numbers were found on his mobile phone, the cops claimed. The person recently appeared for a job interview at a prestigious medical institution in south Delhi. The other doctor also interned at Al-Falah.Haryana’s Nuh district has come under the radar of intel agencies following the blast. In the last week, five suspects — three MBBS doctors, a fertiliser vendor, and an imam — were taken into custody from the area. Multiple raids have been conducted in the district, which was earlier known as Mewat.Sources in the agencies suggest ammonium nitrate, which could have been used in the explosion, was purchased from Nuh. This suspicion is fuelled by reports that past locations of Umar and his doctor colleague, Muzammil, have been traced to Mewat on multiple occasions.The probe has revealed members of the ‘doctor module’ would draft emails in a shared account without sending them. The recipient would log in, read the draft and delete it to avoid leaving digital evidence. This method is generally used in spycraft. The module also used the Threema app, which operates without phone numbers or email IDs, and possibly created a private server to share maps and locations.",Special cell of delhi police has filed an fir to probe what it claimed was a deeper conspiracy in connection with the car blast near red fort.

NEW DELHI: Hours after announcing publicly that she had severed ties with her family, Lalu Prasad Yadav ’s daughter, Rohini Acharya, claimed she was ""thrown out"" by her brother, Tejashwi Yadav , and his close aides, Sanjay Yadav and Rameez. Speaking on the Rashtriya Janata Dal 's (RJD) debacle in the Bihar assembly polls, Rohini said she was ""disgraced, abused, and even hit"" when she questioned Sanjay Yadav and Rameez.""I have no family. You can go and ask this to Sanjay Yadav, Rameez, and Tejashwi Yadav. They are the ones who threw me out of the family. They don't want to take any responsibility... The whole nation is asking why the party failed like this. When you name Sanjay Yadav and Rameez, you are thrown out of the house, disgraced, abused, and even hit,"" Rohini told news agency ANI.Sanjay Yadav referred to in Acharya’s post is a close aide of her brother Tejashwi Yadav, the RJD-ledchief ministerial face in Bihar.

Eyes on Bengal

Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam: The big election year

NEW DELHI: The National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) registered a decisive victory in the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections. The alliance won 202 seats in the 243-member assembly, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerging as the single largest party with 89 seats, closely followed by the Janata Dal (United) (JDU) at 85 seats. The Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) also performed strongly, winning 19 of the 29 seats it contested.The NDA powered through the Bihar elections , securing a decisive win despite opposition’s attempts to raise issues such as alleged “voter chori” by the Centre and the Election Commission, and campaigning around the Special Intensive Revision drive and Voter Adhikar Yatra. However, the NDA’s strong organisational machinery, coupled with its development-focused messaging, neutralised these allegations on the ground, leaving Mahagathbandhan struggling.After such a massive victory, the next obvious question is - what next for NDA?The NDA’s landslide victory sets the stage for a governance cycle anchored in its 69-page manifesto — a roadmap promising one crore employment opportunities, Mega Skill Centres and major infrastructure upgrades including expressways, new rail lines, and international airports in multiple cities.With commitments ranging from 10 new industrial parks, 100 MSME hubs, semiconductor and chipset parks, to transformative welfare pledges such as one crore, expanded Kisan Samman Nidhi, free education for poor children, and 50 lakh new homes, NDA now carries a development agenda, which has to build upon Nitish’s decade-long ruling in the state.The election outcome brought a sharp generational contrast to the forefront. Nitish Kumar , 74, secured a renewed mandate even as the opposition showcased one of its youngest leadership line-ups in years. Despite attacks centred on his age, physical health and even insinuations about his “ill health,” voters ultimately sided with experience over experimentation.Nitish’s consolidated support among Kurmis, EBCs, Mahadalits, and women, boosted by central strength, effectively turned age into an advantage. His reputation as a steady, predictable administrator outweighed concerns over longevity or past political allegiance shifts.Thus, the upcoming term will hinge on the NDA capitalizing on Nitish’s stature as a veteran leader, coupled with the anti-incumbency narrative, while countering renewed questions about his age, particularly as this tenure will span till the time he’s 79.This becomes more significant, looking back on political rivals who had leaned heavily on this line of attack. Jan Suraaj’s Prashant Kishor repeatedly claimed Nitish was “ill” and “his mind not working”. RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav had also argued that Nitsh was no longer in full command and speculated around the JDU leader’s health.In his victory speech, PM Modi gave credit to ""positive MY formula, and that is Mahila and youth"". Yet, taking a look at the elected MLAs’, overall youth representation is at a low. While NDA did use some new, young faces, the overall Assembly age actually is older. The average of NDA MLA-elects is 53, as opposed to 2020’s 52, suggesting that the overall demographic has remained unchanged more or less in the bigger picture.The standout is 25-year-old Maithili Thakur, whose decisive victory in Alinagar introduces a fresh cultural and youth-centric face into the BJP’s Bihar landscape. Her entry — as one of the youngest MLAs — symbolises youth outreach into its leadership pipeline.Chirag Paswan’s LJP (Ram Vilas), with 19 seats, adds another layer to this generational shift. Positioning himself as a “Yuva Bihari” while drawing on the legacy of his father, Ram Vilas Paswan, Chirag has emerged as a central youth figure within the broader NDA framework.Together, these leaders signal NDA’s start to blend legacy governance with new-age political capital, which needs to consider expansion on this formula.In his victory speech, PM Modi moved beyond Bihar, positioning the win as a launchpad for the 2026 West Bengal Assembly elections. PM Modi said that “just as the Ganga flows from Bihar to West Bengal, this victory signals the BJP’s win in West Bengal as well.” West Bengal, which shares a border with Bihar, will hold its next assembly elections in April–May 2026, where Mamata Banerjee will seek a fourth consecutive term as chief minister.The themes that defined the Bihar campaign — welfare delivery, women’s empowerment, organisational cohesion — are expected to form the strategic backbone of the BJP’s Bengal playbook in a high-stakes battleground.The Bihar mandate feeds into the wider national playbook ahead of key elections in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Assam. The NDA might aim to replicate Bihar’s formula — welfare delivery, youth mobilisation, cultural messaging, and alliance cohesion — while adapting it to regional contexts.In Tamil Nadu, the battle will hinge on the anti-SIR narrative, as evident by TVK chief Vijay warning that the verification drive has left many unsure whether their names will remain on the rolls. “If I say that even at this very moment, not everyone in Tamil Nadu has the right to vote, would you believe it? Don’t think I’m trying to scare you… this is the truth,” he said, blaming the SIR.Kerala presents a similar SIR challenge, with the addition that the BJP has to break into a left-dominated ground.Meanwhile, in Assam, the contest centres on anti-incumbency. Himanta Biswa Sarma, who left Congress in 2015 and became chief minister in 2021, now faces his popularity test in 2026 as he seeks to secure a third consecutive victory for the BJP.","The national democratic alliance ( nda ) registered a decisive victory in the 2025 bihar assembly elections.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi dialled RJD neta Tejashwi Yadav for his feedback on Bihar results as the opposition alliance members ""expressed collective disbelief"" over the Patna landslide in favour of the BJP-JDU combine and targeted the Election Commission alleging questionable election processes. The party ordered an internal inquiry to analyse the election data and said it will soon present the evidence of irregularities.A day after the debacle, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul met to discuss the verdict on Saturday. Also present were AICC general secretary K C Venugopal, party treasurer Ajay Maken, and state incharge Krishna Allavaru.Sources said Rahul telephoned Tejashwi Yadav from the meeting for his views on the results, and the RJD functionary expressed shock over the outcome. A similar discussion was also held with CPI (ML) chief Dipankar Bhattacharya.After the huddle, Venugopal told reporters, ""The result from Bihar is unbelievable not only for Congress, but also for the people and our alliance partners. Because a 90%-plus strike rate for a party has not happened in Indian history. We are doing a thorough analysis and collecting the data. Within a week or two, we will come out with concrete proof.""He alleged the EC was totally one-sided and there was no transparency at all, and therefore, the process was questionable.According to sources, the party found JDU voteshare rose from 32.83% in 2020 to 46.20% in the seats it contested, and that of BJP went up from 42.56% to 48.44%, while RJD's share dipped by a fraction from 32.95% in 2020, and that of Congress rose by a couple of points.It was felt that the high scores did not tally with the atmosphere on the ground.It was advocated that additions in the voters' list had to be scrutinised more carefully than the deletions because there is no individual to protest questionable additions while dubious deletions can attract individual complaints. Tejashwi is said to have expressed disbelief that only five votes were polled in a booth (in his constituency). It was also alleged that the commission's final voter number did not tally with the polled and the counting numbers.","Congress mp rahul gandhi dialled rjd neta tejashwi yadav for his feedback on bihar results.

SRINAGAR/NEW DELHI: An “accidental explosion” at Nowgam police station late Friday night, caused by substances seized during raids in an NCR city and transported to Kashmir by police, killed 9 people and injured 30.J&K DGP Nalin Prabhat said at a press briefing in Srinagar on Saturday morning a huge cache of explosive substances, chemicals and reagents were recovered from Faridabad on Nov 9 and 10, during the investigation of an interstate terror module.“The recovery was transported and kept securely in the open area of the police station (Nowgam),” Prabhat said, adding, “As part of prescribed procedure, samples of the recovery had to be forwarded for further forensic and chemical examination. On account of the voluminous and sensitive nature of the recovery, it was being handled with utmost caution. However … an accidental explosion took place at about 11.20 pm on Nov 14. Any other speculation into the cause of this incident is unnecessary.” The DGP didn’t take questions.The Union home ministry, too, said in New Delhi that the Nowgam police station explosion was triggered accidentally as explosives recovered from the recently busted terror module were being handled and sampled by forensic experts and other agencies ahead of their transport to FSL, Jammu.There are SOPs for handling and sampling seized explosives and officials in Delhi said these were followed in Nowgam as police personnel, magisterial staff and forensic experts continued working late into Friday night to complete the sampling. Though protective gear, like bomb suits, is available, forensic teams rarely use them. Officials said an external agent yet to be ascertained but which could be a flying spark from something nearby, may have triggered the explosion, with the cars of teams parked nearby adding to its magnitude.The explosion at the police station, operating from a private house in the heart of Nowgam’s posh Sheikh-ul-Alam Colony, shook large parts of Srinagar and reduced the police station to rubble. Among the nine killed were a Special Investigation Agency officer, three Forensic Science Laboratory personnel, two revenue officials, and a tailor associated with the police station. Thirty others — 27 policemen, two revenue officials and three civilians — were wounded.Nowgam police station had investigated the Jaish-e-Mohammed posters that appeared in Bonpora area of Nowgam on Oct 19, an inquiry that led to the busting of an interstate terror module involving doctors and others.Ruling out any terror angle, J&K DGP Prabhat said the cause of this “unfortunate incident” is being inquired into. L-G Manoj Sinha said govt stands in solidarity with the families, friends, and loved ones of the departed. “All possible assistance is being provided to those affected. I've ordered a probe to ascertain the cause of the accidental explosion,” he added.MHA officials told TOI that around 358 kg of explosives recovered from Faridabad was transported in a Tata 407 goods carrier to Nowgam police station earlier this week as “case property”. As per the law case property, comprising recoveries from all raided locations, must be deposited at the police station where the FIR is registered.“Deeply anguished by the loss of precious lives due to extremely tragic accidental blast at Nowgam Police Station in Srinagar. My condolences to the bereaved families. I pray for speedy recovery of the injured,” the L-G said in a post on X. CM Omar Abdullah extended his “heartfelt condolences” to the bereaved families and prayed for the swift recovery of those injured.Later in the day, when some media channels reported that People's Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF), a JeM proxy declared a “terrorist organisation” by the Union home ministry in 2023, had claimed responsibility for the “attack”, the police issued a quick rebuttal: “The claim of PAFF or any other Pakistani terrorist group is patently false, baseless and mischievous.”J&K police had placed concertina wire at the entrance to Sheikh-ul-Alam Colony on Friday, and policemen carrying AK-47s were allowing people to pass only after thorough checks. The road leading to Nowgam police station, located deep inside the colony, was covered with shattered window panes, twisted tin sheets and other debris as residents stepped out to describe what happened the previous night.“It felt like it was a missile strike,” said a resident living a few hundred metres from the police station. He said he was asleep when a loud bang shook his two-storey house and window panes fell onto his bed. For a moment, he said, he believed a fresh war between India and Pakistan had started. “Then I heard cries, and in the neighbourhood several young girls staying here for studies screamed. It was complete mayhem.”Another resident said he grabbed his child and ran outside after the explosion, seeing policemen fleeing in panic. “One policeman kept saying he was fine, and then blood started coming out of his mouth and he fell down,” he said. Another resident said that when he stepped out and walked towards the police station, he saw a man completely covered in black powder asking for help. “I gave him a cloth to clean himself, and I recognised him as the cook of the police station, who had survived. ”Nowgam police station was housed in a rented building for the past three decades. “I have always seen the police station here. I think in 1997 there was a cylinder blast at the station,” a resident said. He said that over the past few days the police station had seen heavy movement, with several officials visiting regularly station as an “important case was being investigated there”.A labourer who works as a chowkidar in a building near the police station said there was a big blast followed by several smaller explosions that shattered windows and cracked walls in the locality. He said that in the morning he saw policemen recovering some body parts. He said the fire service had arrived within 10 minutes of the explosion and helped douse the flames and save the locality.The police station now lies in complete ruin. Its gate and boundary walls are gone. Several vehicles on the road outside are damaged, their window panes blown out. Inside the compound, charred vehicles lie flipped over by the blast, and the building itself is now a heap of rubble.A young man whose house is adjacent to the police station and separated only by a wall said the blast threw him off his feet and falling window glass injured his eyes and face. He then rushed to the nearby Ujala hospital, across the main road. Those killed in the blast were from different parts of the Valley. Relatives and friends were inconsolable at the wreath-laying ceremony at the police control room, Srinagar.When the body of tailor Mohammad Shafi Parry was brought home in Nowgam on Saturday afternoon, mourning erupted across the area. Locals said he was widely loved and an active social worker in the community.","J&k police confirm 9 killed in nowgam blast after explosives recovered from faridabad blows up.

A paradox the verdict did not resolve

Lalu absent, yet unavoidable

NEW DELHI: This election season in Bihar, Lalu Prasad Yadav did not appear at rallies, did not deliver a single speech, and did not record even a short video for supporters. His party, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), delivered one of its weakest performances in decades, winning only about two dozen seats. And yet the results, the campaign rhetoric, and even voter anxieties seemed to orbit around one man who never entered the arena.Lalu's absence this year may have defined the election as much as his presence once did.The NDA’s sweeping victory, 202 seats between the BJP, JD(U) and allies, was built on a familiar message architecture that repeatedly invoked the spectre of jungle raj. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his victory speech on Friday, Bihar had rejected ""jungle raj"" and ""katta sarkaar,"" choosing development and stability instead.For decades, the term carried clear caste-coded undertones. Today, its meaning has broadened. Uday Chandra , writer and field-based researcher of politics and society, notes that ""jungle raj functions today less as a narrow upper-caste smear than as a broad anxiety about disorder that cuts across caste lines."" That evolution shaped how women, Extremely Backward Classes, Mahadalits and non-Yadav OBCs understood the stakes of their vote.These groups, Chandra says, ""prioritise predictability, personal safety and routine welfare over expressive grievance politics."" Any party that appeared vulnerable to instability began the campaign with a trust deficit. RJD entered the fray knowing it had to battle not only the NDA, but also a historical memory that no longer targeted only upper castes but resonated across the electorate.The party's messaging, as a result, was pushed into a defensive crouch. ""It forces RJD to defend its reputation continuously rather than focusing solely on policy promises,"" Chandra explains. ""Much of its messaging becomes defensive, explaining, denying, contextualising, which is poor terrain when the median voter wants reassurance, not argument.""The electoral map reflected this tension. Though the RJD won only 25 seats, it recorded the highest vote share, 23%, proving its strongholds of Yadav-Muslim loyalty remain intact. But its reach in competitive seats shrank further. As Chandra puts it, ""RJD’s core still turns out strongly but in marginal constituencies the fear-of-disorder payoff favours the side that can credibly promise stability.""""Lalu remains the master symbol of Yadav pride and political memory,"" Chandra says. Symbolism, however, is not the same as vote transfer.Lalu's failure to ensure that the fruits of post-Mandal empowerment were widely dispersed, and not overwhelmingly cornered by Yadavs, also helped the NDA prevent Tejashwi from pulling non-Yadav OBCs and even a section of upper castes toward his promise of development and a break from Lalu-era politics.Internal fragmentation aggravated these shifts. Chandra notes that the Yadav vote ""can be split when local notables run their own machines or when personal rivalries are visible."" In several constituencies, Tej Pratap Yadav 's parallel activity and the presence of strong independents splintered the Yadav vote. These splits did not hurt the RJD in strongholds — but proved lethal in front-line marginals.For many RJD supporters, Tejashwi is the softer, modern face meant to reassure voters uneasy about a return to chaos. For critics, he remains Lalu’s political heir and therefore the inheritor of jungle raj. He ends up fighting two battles simultaneously: his father's past and his coalition’s present. And in 2025, he lost both.Lalu’s relevance is not sustained by nostalgia alone. The infrastructure he built still shapes Bihar’s politics. Chandra points to three drivers of his enduring centrality: ""historical anchoring, identity brokerage, and a relational patronage network.""His tenure in the 1990s reshaped Bihar’s caste politics in ways that even his opponents acknowledge. His presence still influences alliances, candidate selection and the strategies of regional players. And the organisational networks he built, cadres, kinship links, local intermediaries, continue to be activated during elections.This duality explains why Lalu remained the focal point despite the RJD’s weak performance. Opponents framed their campaign around his record; allies used his legacy as political glue. As Chandra observes, ""Opponents weaponise his record to raise risk perceptions among swing voters; allies treat him as an indispensable ledger item in coalition arithmetic.""The NDA ran as much against Lalu as against Tejashwi. The Mahagathbandhan campaigned with Lalu’s symbolism while trying to present a forward-looking message. Voters judged both through the prism of his legacy.The verdict reveals the limits of symbolic politics. The NDA tapped into a broad desire for stability and continuity. Nitish Kumar’s credentials as Sushasan Babu, combined with Modi’s welfare-driven appeal, proved more persuasive than the RJD’s defensive messaging.The RJD struggled to convincingly present itself as a clean break from the 1990s. Tejashwi’s blended pitch, social justice plus governance, was often overshadowed by ambiguity. Was he an inheritor or a reformer? Voters were unsure.The 2025 election may be one of the harshest electoral blows to the RJD, but it also reaffirms something deeper: Lalu Yadav continues to frame the boundaries of how politics is imagined, narrated and contested in Bihar. Every debate about governance, justice, development or security remains tethered to reactions to his legacy.His absence became a presence.This year, Lalu did not campaign, did not speak, did not even wave from a balcony. Yet no NDA rally avoided attacking his past; no MGB rally could afford to ignore his symbolism. He was not on the ballot but still shaped the ballot box.The verdict has sidelined his party, but it has not erased him. Lalu Prasad Yadav remains the axis around which Bihar’s political conversation still turns.","Lalu prasad yadav did not appear at rallies, did not deliver a single speech, and did not record even a short video for supporters. His party, rashtriya janata dal (rjd), delivered one of its weakest performances in decades, winning only about two dozen seats.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125346923,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1451225,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Rahul meets Kharge to discuss Cong's Bihar poll drubbing



NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi , a day after the NDA’s historic win in Bihar, launched a sharp attack on the Congress, saying dissatisfaction was spreading among senior nationalist leaders who had once worked closely with Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.Taking a veiled dig at Rahul Gandhi, Prime Minister said that their frustration stemmed from the conduct of what he called the party’s “namdar” leadership. He further accused the opposition of now turning its anger towards institutions instead of accepting the verdict.Addressing a gathering of Bihari residents in Surat, PM Modi said the Congress and its allies had turned to blaming institutions instead of introspecting.“Opposition can't explain poll rout even to their workers and blaming EVMs, EC and electoral rolls' revision,” he said, calling it part of a “habitual” attempt to discredit constitutional bodies.He also pointed to what he described as growing frustration among younger opposition MPs, saying, “When we meet young Congress members or INDIA alliance members in the Parliament, they say, ‘Sir, what can we do? Our careers are coming to an end.We don't even get a chance to speak in Parliament because these people keep saying, ‘Lock Parliament,’ every time.’ They’re unable to answer their own constituencies...”Turning to Bihar, PM Modi praised the state’s voters for delivering a decisive mandate and setting what he described as a global example. He said Bihar’s political clarity had strengthened the NDA while exposing weaknesses in the opposition’s message. “Bihar is famous worldwide today… Bihar’s women and youth formed a combination that strengthened the foundation of politics for decades to come,” he said.He highlighted the 10 per cent vote gap between the NDA and the Mahagathbandhan as evidence of a clear preference for development.He sharply criticised opposition leaders, accusing them of attempting to divide voters. ""For the past two years, these 'jamanati' politicians, who are out on bail, were going around in Bihar giving speeches about casteism… This election in Bihar has completely rejected that poison of casteism. This is a very bright sign for the country."" He also referred to controversies over Waqf properties, saying Bihar’s voters had dismissed what he called “communal poison”.The NDA secured a massive mandate in the Bihar assembly elections winning 202 seats while the Mahagathbandhan secured 35.Meanwhile, the Congress on Saturday questioned the role of the Election Commission in the Bihar poll process as its top leaders, including Rahul Gandhi and party president Mallikarjun Kharge, met in Delhi to assess the party’s poor performance. Gandhi and Kharge were joined by K C Venugopal, Ajay Maken and Bihar in-charge Krishna Allavaru. Sources said the meeting focused on the Congress winning only six of the 61 seats it contested, its second-worst tally in the state since 2010.After the discussions, Venugopal blamed the Election Commission for the outcome, alleging that “the entire poll process is questionable and there is no transparency”. Calling the result “unbelievable for all of us”, he said alliance partners were also “not believing it”. He argued that a “90 per cent plus strike rate for a political party” had never happened in Indian history and said the Congress was collecting data from across Bihar and would present “concrete proof” within one or two weeks.Venugopal said the conduct of electioneering was “completely questionable” and alleged that “the Election Commission is totally one-sided”.",Pm modi predicts major congress split after nda’s bihar win and warns allies of growing instability.

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Saturday accused the Congress of insulting the people's mandate and looking for excuses to hide its failure, even as the opposition party charged the Election Commission with partisanship following its massive loss in the Bihar election.The attack from the party came on a day the Congress continued to be in the crosshairs of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. While speaking at a programme organised by natives of Bihar in Surat, Modi said that as Congress is unable to explain the reasons for the defeat to its allies or to its members, its top netas have chosen the easy way out by blaming EVMs, SIR and EC. ""They have found a way to make excuses. This excuse may keep them afloat for a while, but their cadre will not accept them for long,"" the PM said.BJP's chief spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Anil Baluni said Congress brass is incapable of introspection despite suffering repeated poll losses and credited the people's trust in the governing alliance's policies and programmes for its big win. Citing excuses to explain away its failures was a tradition in Congress, he said.BJP also played up the rumblings within the opposition camp to mock Congress for blaming the Election Commission.While BJP general secretary Tarun Chugh slammed the party for defaming the country's democratic process and its institutions like EC, its IT department head Amit Malviya highlighted dissenting voices within the opposition alliance to say that the knives are out in Mahagathbandhan after its latest drubbing.Malviya said, ""And now, senior Congress leader Shakeel Ahmad has accused Krishna Allavaru, Rahul Gandhi's pointsman in Bihar, of disrespecting senior leaders and selling Congress tickets for cash... Mahagathbandhan was never about principles - it was an opportunistic stitch-up held together by corruption and self-interest."" He added, ""The people of Bihar saw through it.

‘Misa-Priyanka Ko Dickey Mein…’: Yashwant Deshmukh’s Message to RJD–Cong After NDA’s Bihar Win

PATNA: The RJD appears to be trying to come to terms with its dismal performance in the just-concluded Bihar assembly election, though it has so far refrained from seconding the allegations of 'vote theft' being levelled by its ally Congress.Although Tejashwi Yadav , who was the opposition alliance's CM face in the polls, has been incommunicado after the party's disastrous show, his party RJD sought to convey the message that victory and defeat are part of electoral process.""Public service is a continuous process, an endless journey! Ups and downs are bound to come in it. No despair in defeat, no arrogance in victory!"" the party said in a social media post from its official handle on Saturday.""RJD is the party of the poor and will continue to raise their voice while living among the poor!"" the post said further.The official response, though, is in sharp contrast with the angry reactions by party spokespersons.""Jab yahi karna tha toh chunao ka natak nahin karna chahiya tha (There was no need for the farce of elections if they had to do this),"" Chitranjan Gagan, a party spokesperson, said.No one from RJD chief Lalu Prasad's family has so far commented on the results.
