'Only Mistake I Made Was...': Prajwal Revanna Tells Court Before Life Sentence In Rape Case

Poll Do you think protests will effectively change the political situation in Punjab? Yes No

PATIALA: AAP MLA Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra has allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.According to Punjab Police sources, Pathanmajra and his accomplices fired at police officers during the escape and even ran over one personnel, leaving him injured.According to reports, Pathanmajra and his accomplices ran over police personnel with an SUV.The Sanour MLA was arrested a day after publicly criticising his party’s Delhi leadership.His detention in Patiala was linked to a rape case filed against him, sparking political uproar in the region.In a social media post, Pathanmajra claimed the case related to his former wife and alleged that the fresh charges of rape were politically motivated.“I was booked because I raised my voice against my own government, especially the Delhi leadership,” he wrote.His brother, Hardev Singh, said the MLA was taken into custody under Section 376 of the IPC despite already having been granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. “He was arrested from Dabri in Haryana in a case where bail was already granted. This is clearly an attempt to silence him,” he alleged.CIA Patiala confirmed that three weapons have been recovered and one accomplice of MLA Pathanmajra has been arrested.The arrested individual has been identified as Balwinder Singh, while the search for MLA Pathanmajra continues.Police said two officers were injured when stones were thrown at them during the MLA’s escape attempt.Authorities added that supporters of the MLA not only pelted stones but also opened fire at the police team.Before his arrest, Pathanmajra had appealed to colleagues and supporters via Facebook to protest outside the Patiala SSP’s office at the Mini Secretariat. He urged people to reach “in tractors, trolleys, and cars” to demand his release. “I will not be silenced even if more cases are registered against me. Will AAP’s Delhi leadership rule Punjabis now? Even Congress and BJP did not interfere to this extent,” he said.The MLA has repeatedly accused the party’s central leadership of sidelining Punjab leaders and “remote-controlling” the state. Recently, he criticised officials of the Irrigation Department over flood relief efforts in his constituency. Soon after, his security cover was withdrawn and police officers in the area were reshuffled — moves that raised eyebrows.“This is retaliation. They looted Punjab more than Abdali. Now they want to sell Punjab,” Pathanmajra declared.","Harmeet singh pathanmajra allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station.

Poll Should there be stricter laws against illegal sand mining? Yes, absolutely. No, current laws are sufficient.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Saturday issued a clarification after a video surfaced showing him reprimanding a woman IPS officer over action against illegal soil excavation in Solapur.In a statement, Pawar said his ""intention was not to interfere with law enforcement but to ensure that the situation on the ground remained calm and did not escalate further."" He stressed that he holds ""the highest respect for the police force, including women officers who serve with distinction.""""My attention has been drawn to certain videos circulating regarding my interaction with police officials in Solapur.

In the video, Pawar rebuked the IPS officer, sternly asking her to stop action against illegal excavation of murrum soil, widely used in road construction. The officer initially failed to recognise his voice, prompting Pawar to switch to a video call and identify himself.The incident sparked sharp political reactions. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut accused Pawar of shielding ""thieves"" and questioned his right to remain in office. ""He is scolding her to provide protection to the thieves of his party… Ministers should be ashamed,"" Raut alleged, adding that illegal soil mining robs the state exchequer.The NCP defended Pawar, saying the video had been selectively leaked and that his intent was not to halt the police crackdown but to defuse tensions with local workers.","Ajit pawar issued a clarification after a video surfaced showing him reprimanding a woman ips officer over action against illegal soil excavation in solapur.

Is this the respect you show to our orders?” the bench remarked on September4, questioning the municipal body’s repeated inaction despite earlier directions.“It is very difficult to restrain ourselves but is this the way you behave? Is there any ego issue that you say the archaeology department will do?"" the bench added.The court examined a report by senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, who visited the site as court commissioner and flagged non-compliance with previous orders.Finding a communication gap between the court and MCD, the bench summoned the MCD commissioner to appear the same day.""We find that there is too much of a communication gap between the court and the MCD. We would thus like the commissioner of the MCD to be personally present in the court at 3 pm so that whatever order the Court passes is in his presence so that it is taken in the right spirit,"" the bench said.The judges also expressed frustration over repeated delays. ""We have been constrained to pass this order as we have been giving sufficient leverage and latitude to the MCD to come clean by showing its bonafide but we find that our hopes have been dashed by the conduct and the stand taken by the MCD,” the court observed.When the commissioner appeared, he admitted there had been a communication gap regarding the cemented portion and assured the court it would be removed.The top court has now directed the MCD commissioner to hold officers accountable and submit an action plan to fix the lapses. It also ordered that a senior officer be deputed to monitor the monument daily, with details shared with the court commissioner.Posting the matter for September 18, the bench also asked the MCD to file a report identifying officials responsible for disobeying orders and the action taken against them.The case stems from a plea filed by Defence Colony resident Rajeev Suri, who sought to have the Gumti declared a protected monument under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958. The Delhi High Court had dismissed his plea in 2019, following which he approached the Supreme Court.The apex court has since been issuing directions to ensure removal of encroachments, illegal occupation, and beautification of the heritage site.","Justices ahsanuddin amanullah and s v n bhatti directed the mcd commissioner to fix responsibility on officers and submit an action plan.

The Meitei group argued that Manipur being under President's rule, the state administration lacked the constitutional and moral authority to represent people in tripartite talks.""The decision to extend the SoO under such circumstances is illegitimate and reflects an undemocratic and hegemonic imposition on the indigenous people and elected representatives of Manipur,"" COCOMI said.On NH2 being reopened, it said turning citizens' free movement into a bargaining chip with armed groups violates constitutional rights and leaves the Meitei population ""vulnerable"".Manipur has been under President's rule since Feb 13, clamped within a week of N Biren Singh resigning as CM on Feb 9.

""Rs 90,"" said the vendor. The tourist blinked. ""For one? Wasn't it Rs 40 last year?"" Once an easy indulgence, the humble coconut has turned into a luxury in much of India's south, with prices up from Rs 15-25 just two years ago to anywhere between Rs 80 and Rs 100 now.In Kerala, the crisis has a phrase: ""Moongan irunna naayudey thalayil thenga veenu."" A coconut falling on the head of a dog that was already looking for an excuse to cry. Trouble piling onto trouble.Today's shortage can be traced to the pandemic years. Tender coconut sales collapsed in 2020-21 as supply chains froze, leading to over-mature nuts and a glut by 2022-23, crashing prices and discouraging care for trees. ""Farmers didn't replant after the 2023 crash. Now yields have dropped and recovery takes years,"" said farmer-producer group member Sunil Cyriac. Lost time cannot be reclaimed in a single season. Tall trees need five to eight years to bear fruit. Shorter hybrids, three.Climatic swings - heavy rain in 2022, drought in 2023, scorching heat in 2024-25 - left plantations reeling in Karnataka. Pests damaged 30% of output in Tumakuru, Mandya, Hassan, Chikkamagaluru and Chitradurga.Cyclonic damage and pest attacks hit 25% of plantations in Andhra Pradesh. In TN, root wilt disease and whitefly infestation wiped out 40% of yields in Krishnagiri and Tirunelveli.Kerala faced leaf rot disease in central and northern zones and mid-whorl yellowing in south, leading to abnormal nut fall and tree death. Rhinoceros beetles and red palm weevils added to the devastation.The festival season - Onam in Kerala, Ganesh Chaturthi nationwide - sent the market into a spiral. Copra, oil and fresh nut prices have soared as shortages deepen.Panaji market vendor Sulagna Gaunekar blamed high labour and transport costs. Tourism added pressure, with tender coconuts overharvested for quick profits, cutting into next year's yield. Goa's agriculture director Sandeep Fol Dessai cited a mix of pests, fungal infections and ""monkey menace"". He said as farmers migrated to cities, leaving plantations unattended, ""Monkeys destroyed crops.""Production for 2024-25 stood at 1,508 lakh nuts - far short of demand. Goa Horticulture Corporation rushed in 75,000 coconuts from Karnataka, selling at a subsidised Rs 40-45. They sold out in hours.Officials said the crisis was global. Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Sri Lanka also saw a drop in output. ""Price fluctuation had related factors - crop neglect and climate variation,"" said Coconut Development Board marketing director Deepthy Nair.Coconut oil prices reflected the strain - Rs 4,23,000 per metric tonne in India, nearly triple in two years, according to a Reuters report. Worldwide production flatlined at 3.67 million tonnes in 2024-25, the US agriculture dept reported.At beaches, markets and temples, coconuts now carry the weight of climate change, fungus, beetles, neglect and broken supply chains - all packed into a single hard shell.

The Constitution does not make any distinction between majority and minority community in the appointments to any govt post,"" they said.The PIL referred to Union law minister's statement in Lok Sabha on Dec 2024 that govt has requested the chief justices of the HCs to send names of suitable candidates belonging to SCs, STs, OBCs, minorities and women to the SC collegium for considering them for appointment as HC judges to ensure social diversity in the appointment of judge.The PIL said such a request was unconstitutional as selections to constitutional posts cannot be based on a person's religion.On May 5, the SC collegium circulated a list containing 303 names of persons approved for appointment as HC judges between Nov 9, 2022 and Nov 10, 2024 and another 103 names from Nov 11, 2024 to Apr 16, 2025.The list identified those from the minority communities the backward classes, who had figured among the recommendations.Referring to the list of names made public by the SC regarding recommendations made from 2022 till 2025, the petitioner said as many as 24 appointments appear to have been made from minority communities based on their religion. In contrast, only 13 persons from SC/ST category were recommended for judgeship, it said, and alleged that injustice has been done to those belonging to Dalit and tribal communities.The PIL asked - ""Whether the SC Collegium acted unconstitutionally and illegally in conceding to the request of the central govt to consider names of persons belonging to minority communities?"" - and requested the SC on the judicial side to restrain govt from appointing the individuals, who have been recommended based on their religion, as HC judges.",A new pil challenged the quota for minority communities in the selection of persons for appointment as judges of the hcs. The pil said it ran counter to the cardinal constitutional principle of'secularism' the official revelation of religion and types of backwardness of persons recommended for hc judgeship nearly four months ago by the sc was cited by pil petitioners.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123726521,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-39114,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Kashmir sees political fight over defacing of National Emblem in Hazratbal shrine & religious holiday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kashmir-sees-political-fight-over-defacing-of-national-emblem-in-hazratbal-shrine-religious-holiday/articleshow/123726256.cms,"SRINAGAR: Unidentified worshippers defaced the inauguration plaque bearing the National Emblem of India at Srinagar’s Hazratbal Shrine after Friday prayers, leading to J&K Waqf Board chairperson and BJP politician Darakhshan Andrabi blaming National Conference for “defacing the plaque and removing the emblem”.Politically, the Valley had already been tense since Friday morning after the LG-led J&K administration had drawn sharp criticism from politicians and religious clerics for failing to reschedule the Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi holiday to Saturday, in line with the lunar calendar. Instead, the LG-led administration observed a public holiday on account of Eid-e-Milad on Friday, a day earlier than the actual date of commencement of Eid-e-Milad, marking the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad.Andrabi responded from the shrine itself, holding a press conference on Friday evening where she said, “Those who broke the emblem at Hazratbal Dargah should be booked under the PSA. It is like a cloudburst that broke on me after I saw the emblem being broken.” She also asked police and waqf officials to bodily search the MLA if and when he visits the shrine “so that there are no currency notes in his pocket (because they bear the National Emblem).Otherwise, if he has, then that will be ‘makroh (disapproved of but not strictly forbidden)…’”.The plaque had been installed by the J&K Waqf Board to mark the reconstruction and redevelopment of the shrine, inaugurated on Sept 3. Andrabi had already faced muted criticism on social media for allowing the National Emblem-bearing plaque inside the shrine.NC chief spokesperson and party legislator Tanvir Sadiq said idol worship is strictly forbidden in Islam. “The foundation of our faith is Tawheed (Islamic monotheism). Placing a sculpted figure at the revered Hazratbal Dargah goes against this very belief. Sacred spaces must reflect only the purity of Tawheed, nothing else,” Sadiq said.NC MP from Srinagar Aga Ruhullah Mehdi said, “A sacred place that has stood for centuries needs no one’s nameplate for legitimacy. People were rightly offended by this dangerous attempt to play with religious sensitivities for self-glorification,"" Mehdi said. He said Hazratbal has seen reconstructions before, but never were such means used to claim credit. “Any talk of using PSA in this case only adds insult to injury. It is foolish, unacceptable, and an assault on people’s attachment to their beloved shrine.""PDP representative Iltija Mufti reacted sharply to Andrabi's statement, saying that “labelling Kashmiris as ‘terrorists’ just because they expressed their anger at something which hurt their religious sentiments, and asking police to slap them with PSA, reflects BJPs punitive and communal mindset.” She added: “The waqf board should certainly have been more mindful & sensitive. It seems that Muslims are being deliberately being provoked. ”J&K minister Sakina Itoo said it was unjust that Eid-e-Milad was not observed as a holiday on the correct date in J&K. “What does ‘subject to appearance of the Moon’ mean if it is not followed? Despite repeated requests from the elected govt to shift the holiday, no action has been taken,” she said. “This is playing with the emotions of the people,” she added.CM Omar Abdullah joined her, stating that “the calendar printed by the govt press is very clear — “Subject to the appearance of the Moon”. It means that the holiday is subject to change depending upon the Moon being sighted. The deliberate decision by the unelected govt to not shift the holiday is inconsiderate and designed to hurt the sentiments of the people.” Mirwaiz Umar Farooq also condemned the move.",Unidentified worshippers defaced the plaque bearing the national emblem of india at srinagar’s hazratbal shrine after friday prayers.

NEW DELHI: Calling it “unfortunate” that a prime minister who calls himself OBC has steered clear of social justice measures, Congress on Friday accused Narendra Modi of not implementing reservations in private educational institutions, including higher education, for 11 years since the Supreme Court gave its nod to the Constitutional Amendment of Article 15(5). The party demanded that the Modi govt bring a law to activate the constitutional provision in the coming Winter session of Parliament.Congress also slammed the non-revision of income ceiling for OBC “creamy layer” which is pending for five years.Heads of the party’s tribal, SC and OBC departments — Vikrant Bhuria, Rajendra Gautam and Anil Jaihind — said quotas in private educational bodies is the crying need of the hour, because private bodies dominate the education scene in the era of privatisation but with a small share of backward classes as students. They said the ‘parliamentary standing committee on education, women, children, youth and sports’ in its report on Aug 20 noted that private institutions of eminence have 0.89% SC students, 0.53% STs and 11.16% OBCs.In this context, the panel, with members from all the parties, including BJP and headed by Congress MP Digvijaya Singh, recommended that the Centre pass a law to implement Article 15(5) to provide 15% quota for SCs, 7.5% for STs and 27% for OBCs in private higher educational institutions.“Modi is sitting on this law for 11 years after the SC judgement upheld it. And, he calls himself an OBC,” Gautam said. Congress reminded that the Modi govt passed quotas for economically weaker sections within 48 hours but is not able to activate the law for the backward classes.Jaihind slammed the govt for not revising the income ceiling for OBC creamy layer for the last five years, saying it is hurting the prospects of backward caste candidates in education and employment. Jaihind said the income ceiling is revised every three years and was last hiked in 2017, referring to a major controversial issue that has been repeatedly taken up by the Mandal outfits.Congress demanded that the govt bring in a provision which would allow the unfilled quota seats of OBCs to be transferred to the “creamy layer” OBCs, just like the unfilled EWS seats are filled by the general castes.",Modi govt not implementing quota for backward classes in pvt edu institutions: congress.

He said that the people are not getting access to food on time, and the government has made no arrangements to solve the problem of mosquitoes.""We have come to a relief camp to inquire of the condition of the people. They are facing several problems. They are not getting food on time, there is a mosquito menace but to no arrangement to mitigate that, there is a drinking water issue, we were told that tents were set up only yesterday, even though it was already raining,"" Kejriwal said.He further urged the government to make all the necessary arrangements for the people, as it is their duty. Kejriwal mentioned that several areas in New Delhi are facing waterlogging because desilting could not take place on time.The AAP chief stated that the drains in New Delhi are also not cleaned due to which several areas are facing backflow of sewers.""We can understand that this is a natural calamity but it is the Govt's responsibility to make all arrangements for people.We urge Govt to provide all facilities to the people in the relief camps. There is waterlogging everywhere in Delhi, the main reason behind this in several areas is that desilting could not take place on time, drains were not cleaned on time and several areas are facing backflow of sewers. There is no drinking water in several areas. So, we urge the Govt to provide as many facilities as available to the people,"" he said.The former Delhi CM requested the Union Government to provide relief to the common people amidst flash floods in many areas of North India.""Entire north India - J&K, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi and Uttarakhand are reeling under flood. So, I urge the Centre to provide relief to people as much as possible. The Centre provided relief material to Afghanistan after it suffered an earthquake.

Poll Should local authorities improve drainage systems to prevent future flooding? Yes, it is essential. No, it's not a priority.





NEW DELHI: Water swallowed Jharoda Kalan and parts of Gitanjali Colony in southwest Delhi, turning what were once narrow village lanes into swirling, muddy rivers. People took shelter on a nearby flyover, from where they recorded videos of what were once their homes.Jharoda Kalan, a village near the Delhi-Haryana border, is known for its agricultural fields and traditional settlements but has seen rapid urbanization and is, therefore, a mix of old and developing Delhi. It houses the Delhi Police Training College and is linked by rural roads, along which Gitanjali Colony got deluged.SEE ALSO: Delhi-NCR Rains Live Updates In the lanes, bolting the doors proved useless as torrents of brown water smashed through courtyards and climbed the walls inch by inch. Families stumbled out, the water reaching beyond their knees, mothers balancing toddlers on one hip while carrying sacks of clothes and utensils on the other. ""Paani bahut zyada hai,"" was the painful plaint everywhere.Further afield, Mungeshpur was in particular distress. ""This isn't rainwater. This is the water of negligence,"" muttered an angry Shivnath, 35, who waded to safety with his children on Tuesday night.""The Mungeshpur drain broke on Haryana's side, but nobody repaired it in time. By afternoon, the water had reached our waist; by evening, it was up to our chest. We left everything behind and ran.""The breach, caused by pressure from the Yamuna, was reported on Tuesday afternoon. By nightfall, the lowest-lying areas were submerged in 8ft of water. The colony, home to around 5,000 people, saw some 2,000 residents affected and displaced. By Wednesday, a municipal school nearby had been converted into a shelter. On the classroom floors, mats were spread out like patchwork; bags, wet clothes and pots lined the corners. Volunteers moved through the crowd distributing puri-sabzi and bottled water.Municipal officials clarified that they had initiated rescue operations after flooding was reported in an unauthorised colony adjacent to Urban Extension Road II. ""By evening 3,000 people had been shifted to the relief camp in a school. We have also made preparations at two community halls to accommodate more people,"" an MCD official said.Rinku Devi, who shifted here with her family of five, fought back tears. ""There was so much water we couldn't think of anything except getting out of the house. All our furniture, clothes and utensils are gone,"" she mumbled. Her neighbour, Abhay, summed up the loss bitterly: ""Poora grihasti kharaab ho gaya."" Standing beside him, Shanti added, ""It wasn't just the drain breaking. The potholes accumulated water too. This is civic negligence as much as nature. ""Local municipal councillor Amit Kharkhari said officials responded as soon as the breach was reported. ""We evacuated people and set up the relief camp within hours. We are in touch with the Haryana govt, but the water flow is very heavy. Containing it will take time,"" he said.""The damaged portion of Mungeshpur drain is being repaired under the supervision of Nasib Kumar, the sub-divisional magistrate of Bahadurgarh. The State Disaster Relief Force and the irrigation departments of Haryana and Delhi are also involved,"" said Swapnil Ravindra Patil, deputy commissioner, Jhajjar. ""The repair work is now complete. Currently, work to strengthen the drain is going on.""The MCD official confirmed this. ""There was flooding in Mungeshpur after leakage in the drain on the Haryana side and municipal staff extended all support to the authorities there until the drain was repaired,"" the official said.Back in Jharoda Kalan, on the bigger street, tractors stood like floating lifeboats, loaded with important items ripped from the homes in great hurry. Police stood in the ankle-deep swirling water, trying to keep order. Boats of the National Disaster Response Force sliced through the lanes to reach families trapped on terraces. In one boat, a rescued pet dog sat placidly amid the chaos. Another struggle - the painstaking rebuilding of lives washed away overnight - will only begin once the waters recede.","Water swallowed jharoda kalan and parts of gitanjali colony in southwest delhi.

Ciara ensures Russell Wilson’s name is part of her son’s identity



Russell Wilson embraces his role as stepdad with grace



Ciara and Russell Wilson have once again captured public attention, not with a red carpet moment, but with a deeply personal family milestone. The singer legally added her husband’s last name, Wilson, to her eldest son Future Zahir’s legal name — a move that fans had speculated about for years. The update underscores the couple’s commitment to their blended family and Russell’s steady presence as a stepfather.The story first reignited when Russell Wilson posted a family photo from the U.S. Open, captioning it, “Mrs. @ciara Wilson Future Wilson & Sienna Wilson.” Fans quickly noticed that Ciara’s 11-year-old son, born to rapper Future, was listed with the Wilson surname, sparking questions about adoption.Sources confirmed that Ciara, who has full custody, had legally added “Wilson” to her son’s name years ago. His complete legal name still carries Wilburn, from his biological father, but the addition reflects a symbolic recognition of Russell’s role. The decision wasn’t overnight. Back in 2019, Ciara filed a petition to change her son’s name to Russell Wilson Jr., though it was reportedly denied. Despite the legal hurdles, Ciara never wavered in her intent to honor Russell Wilson’s influence as a father figure.For Russell Wilson, the name change simply puts on paper what he has lived daily since marrying Ciara nine years ago. Speaking on I AM ATHLETE in 2024, he explained his philosophy: “When you’re raising children … you’ve got to love every single child as if they’re yours. God gave me that opportunity to raise them and love them and care for them … And there's no difference [between Future and his siblings].”Those words resonate with the way Ciara and Wilson present their family—united, supportive, and joyful, as seen courtside at the U.S. Open. While Future has remained silent on the matter, the quiet evolution of his son’s identity tells its own story.Ultimately, the legal recognition of “Wilson” in Future Zahir’s name marks more than a paperwork update. It shows how Ciara and Russell Wilson continue to strengthen their family bond, with love, resilience, and stability in a way that feels both deeply personal and powerfully symbolic.Also read: Haley Cavinder matches twin Hanna in cheeky Cowboys ‘stars’ fit while cheering Jake Ferguson in season opener against Eagles","Future jr. officially becomes future wilson after ciara adds russell wilson’s last name to records.
