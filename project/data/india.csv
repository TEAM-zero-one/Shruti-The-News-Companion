'Couldn't tolerate my jovial nature': Tej Pratap Yadav says 5 families conspired to ruin his life; vows to expose them,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/couldnt-tolerate-my-jovial-nature-tej-pratap-yadav-says-5-families-conspired-to-ruin-his-life-vows-to-expose-them/articleshow/123443310.cms,"NEW DELHI: Expelled RJD leader and former Bihar minister Tej Pratap Yadav on Thursday alleged that five powerful families conspired against him to destroy both his political and personal life.The elder son of RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav claimed he would soon reveal their identities.“Five families together and in a broader conspiracy tried to end my political life. In my more than ten years of political life, I have never wronged anyone, nor have I ever conspired against anyone. But these five families have made every effort to destroy my political and family life completely,” Tej Pratap wrote on X.He further said, “Tomorrow (Friday), I will bring the faces and characters of all five families before the public. I am going to expose each of their conspiracies tomorrow.”On Wednesday, Tej Pratap had also posted, “Five people worked together to completely ruin my life... They could not tolerate my jovial nature and hence made such allegations to ruin my career. I will go to court and file a case too... I think these people took money from RSS and BJP and tried to tarnish my image because they saw that elections are coming and there is a craze among the youth for me.I will soon put the names of these people from five families in front of everyone. .. These conspirators have a gang from Patna to Delhi... They used to be in RJD but were expelled due to their misdeeds... These individuals have no other job except to be constantly active on social media, using it to tarnish the image of others...”Tej Pratap’s remarks come months after his father Lalu Prasad expelled him from the Rashtriya Janata Dal and “family” for six years in May, after a controversial Facebook post claimed he had been in a 12-year-long relationship with a woman named Anushka Yadav. Tej Pratap later alleged that his Facebook account had been hacked and that the post was part of a conspiracy against him.Following his expulsion, Tej Pratap launched a separate political outfit under the banner of ‘Team Tej Pratap Yadav’ and aligned with five smaller parties to contest the upcoming 2025 Bihar assembly elections. He has been campaigning aggressively across the state, often calling his rivals “Jaychand” (traitors).Lalu Prasad earlier in May had justified the expulsion by saying, “Ignoring moral values in personal life weakens our collective struggle for social justice. The actions, public conduct, and irresponsible behavior of my eldest son are not in accordance with our family’s principles. Therefore, under these circumstances, I am removing him from the party and the family.”Tej Pratap’s younger brother and leader of opposition in Bihar, Tejashwi Yadav, had said at the time that while the party would not tolerate such controversies, his brother was “an adult and free to make decisions.”","The elder son of rjd chief lalu prasad yadav claimed he would soon reveal their identities.

2026 Tamil Nadu election a direct fight between TVK & DMK: Vijay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2026-tn-election-a-direct-fight-between-tvk-dmk-vijay/articleshow/123442609.cms,"MADURAI: TVK chief Vijay on Thursday positioned himself as the alternative to “Stalin uncle” saying the 2026 assembly election would be a straight fight between his party and DMK.In a fiery 34-minute speech at TVK’s second state conference at Parapathi, Madurai, Vijay accused DMK of hypocrisy. “You ask women to call you appa (father), but there is no safety for women themselves,” he said addressing Stalin, before asking the crowd if DMK had fulfilled its promises. As they shouted “no,” he said, “Stalin uncle, hear the noise of the people.”On DMK’s approach to BJP, Vijay accused the ruling party of shifting positions. “When in opposition, they flew black balloons against Modi. Now, as the ruling party, they welcome him. Whenever ED raids take place, they rush to Delhi and the raids fade away. Stalin uncle, what uncle? It is very wrong uncle,” he said, and the gathered cadres burst into laughter.The TVK chief also posed pointed questions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking whether he had come to power for the third time “to do good for the people or to plot something against the Muslim community”.He pressed Centre to retrieve Katchatheevu island, withdraw NEET and resolve the plight of “around 800 fishermen” arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy. He accused BJP of hiding facts about the Keeladi excavations and depending on “alliance partners without real people power” to extend its rule till 2029.Without naming AIADMK, Vijay said BJP was using the party once nurtured by M G Ramachandran as a “backdoor to enter Tamil Nadu”. He said that even that party’s cadres were upset with their present state.TVK, he said, would be a “truly secular party” that would never have any hidden tie-up with BJP. He added that alliances under TVK would give equal power to partners.Indirectly addressing critics, Vijay said, “A lion comes to the ground only to hunt, not to pass time. Even if it is single, it will be the king of the jungle. It is not just a description but a clear declaration.” He greeted his cadres as “lion cubs” and described TVK as an “army of common people.”Vijay said TVK had already created “ripples” in state politics. “Many said I will not enter politics, then that I will not get support, then that I cannot conduct a conference. Now they say I cannot win elections. They also say this crowd may not translate into votes. To those analysts, I say — this crowd is not just support, we have already entered every household in the state.”He emphasised that the safety of women, children and the elderly would be TVK’s top priority, and pledged welfare measures for youth, farmers, labourers, weavers, fisherfolk, the disabled, elderly and transpersons.Amid cheers, Vijay made a surprise announcement, saying he would contest from Madurai East constituency in 2026. After a short pause, Vijay named all the nine remaining constituencies and asked people to assume that he himself is contesting in all 234 assembly constituencies in the state.In a symbolic gesture, he sang an MGR song from the movie ‘Enga Veetu Pillai’, asking whether people could “take the whip of politics” and use it against both BJP and DMK.Vijay concluded with a parting shot at stereotypes about actors in politics. “Leaders such as Ambedkar, Kamaraj and Nallakannu were defeated by politicians, not by cinema actors. Not all politicians are knowledgeable, and not every actor is an idiot,” he declared, drawing loud applause.","Tvk chief vijay positioned himself as the alternative to ‘stalin uncle’ he said the 2026 assembly election would be a straight fight between his party and dmk.

AHMEDABAD: Twenty-nine years after then Gujarat minister Atmaram Patel's dhoti was pulled during a BJP function at Sardar Patel Stadium, a city sessions court on Thursday dropped the criminal case against former Union minister A K Patel, one of the two first BJP Lok Sabha members.Another BJP politician, Mangaldas Patel, was also an accused in the case, registered at Naranpura police station under IPC Section 307 (attempt to murder) for allegedly assaulting and pulling off the minister's dhoti in 1996.The accused had backed Shankersinh Vaghela at the time of his rift with then chief minister Keshubhai Patel. The incident occurred immediately after BJP's Atal Bihari Vajpayee had finished addressing the party gathering.Public prosecutor Sudhir Brahmbhatt filed an application under CrPC Section 321 seeking withdrawal of the case against the 95-year-old former MP. The co-accused in the case, Mangaldas Patel, and witness (victim) Atmaram Patel, had passed away during the pendency of the trial.After hearing the submissions, additional sessions judge H G Pandya observed: ""The case involves an internal political party dispute that occurred 28 years ago, and the victim, Atmarambhai Maganbhai Patel, has passed away... The public prosecutor's request to withdraw the case appears to be made with bona fide intentions, and sufficient consideration has been given to withdrawing the prosecution. Therefore, considering the records and the nature of the offence, it is appropriate to grant permission to withdraw the prosecution under Section 321 of CrPC in the interest of justice. ""Earlier, on Jan 30, 2018, a metropolitan court had dropped a related criminal case against 41 BJP workers and politicians, including VHP leader Pravin Togadia and BJP MLA from Daskroi Babu Jamna Patel.","Former union minister a k patel was one of the two first bjp lok sabha members.

GUWAHATI: The Assam cabinet approved Thursday a proposal to freeze issuance of Aadhaar to first-time adult applicants in the state from October 1 as part of a revised SOP meant to curb fraudulent enrolment, especially by suspected illegal immigrants.CM Himanta Biswa Sarma , who had announced in June that all new Aadhaar applications would need to be vetted by the district administrative heads, said citizens above 18 without the 12-digit unique identification number would get ""a final one-month window"" until Sept-end to apply for theirs.Applicants from the SC, ST and tea tribes will get an additional year to enrol for Aadhaar. After the general deadline ends, only deputy commissioners are authorised to approve enrolment in the ""rarest of rare cases"" based on reports from police, special branch and foreigners' tribunals.Sarma said Aadhaar coverage in Assam had exceeded the state's population at 103%. SC, ST and tea tribes are the exception, with 4% still unregistered.""We have taken this decision based on the surge of Bangladeshi immigrants caught entering the state illegally, especially over the past year. Just the other day, we pushed back seven of them,"" the chief minister said.""We aren't sure we have been able to catch all of them. So, we want to create a bulwark against people trying to enter Assam illegally, enrolling for Aadhaar and living as Indian nationals.We want to completely close that door.""Assam's Aadhaar policy is now the most restrictive in the country, driven by concerns over illegal immigration and demographic changes.

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: Delhi schools faced another wave of panic on Thursday after at least five institutions, including BGS International Public School in Dwarka Sector 5, reported receiving bomb threats.According to officials, Delhi Police and Fire Department teams rushed to the spots immediately, cordoning off the premises and launching thorough searches with bomb disposal squads, sniffer dogs and advanced detection equipment.Ambulances and fire tenders were stationed outside the schools as a precautionary measure.The fresh alerts come barely a day after over 60 schools in the capital received near-identical hoax threats that forced emergency evacuations and widespread checks.Officials said the latest threat emails bore a resemblance to Wednesday’s messages, which were traced to a sender using a VPN to mask identity.Police sources revealed that the original email, received late Tuesday night by over 380 IDs, had demanded $2,000 in cryptocurrency (Ethereum) and claimed bombs were planted across schools.The sender, identifying as “Terrorizers 111 group,” threatened to trigger high-yield explosives if the payment was not made.Investigators are working with the Cyber Crime Unit and intelligence agencies to track the origin of the threats. Authorities, however, stressed that all schools targeted so far have been declared safe.“Though these seem to be hoax threats, we cannot take chances when children’s safety is involved. All response protocols have been activated again today,” a senior police officer said.This marks the third major bomb scare in Delhi schools within a week, raising questions over cybersecurity and the psychological impact on students and parents.Earlier on Monday, similar threats were sent to around 32 schools, which were later confirmed to be hoaxes.","Multiple schools in delhi, noida get bomb threat, kids sent back home after high alert.

What Dharali & Chasoti disasters have in common,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-dharali-chasoti-disasters-have-in-common/articleshow/123439166.cms,"The stream in Chasoti village where the torrent of water surged through and destroyed the homes in its path. (Photo by: Vishant V Agarwala)

CHASOTI/DEHRADUN: Within nine days, two Himalayan villages separated by hundreds of kilometres but bound by similar economies and geographies were torn apart by sudden floods. Dharali in Uttarkashi was hit on Aug 5, and Chasoti in J&K’s Kishtwar followed on Aug 14. Both live off pilgrim traffic and the rhythms of apple and walnut orchards. Both saw their temples, bridges and farmland vanish in minutes. Both were said to have been hit by cloudbursts, a familiar shorthand in the mountains. Yet meteorological records tell a different story -- the rain that fell in those hours was too little, too scattered, to have unleashed such destruction. And in neither village was there any weather monitoring system that might have clarified the sequence of events.The contradiction has led scientists to suggest another possibility -- that these were glacial lake outburst floods, or GLOFs, disasters triggered when melting glaciers or fragile moraine dams gave way. The question matters. If rainfall was not the culprit, then the risks faced by mountain communities are even more unpredictable than assumed.At noon on Aug 14 in Chasoti, Suresh Chander, 49, was at his dhaba near the stream when the sound came. “On the night of Aug 13, there was no heavy rain. Even the next day, only a thin drizzle, the kind that barely makes you wet. I was at my dhaba when the water came down and we just ran,” he said. “My family survived, but my uncle Dina Nath, 75, a priest at one of the three temples, was taken. Three temples were gone in minutes. I grow apples, but what kept us going was the yatra season. ”IMD gauges near Dharali logged only low totals on Aug 5, even as floods struck and left one killed and at least 68 feared dead, forcing a halt in the Gangotri yatra. In Chasoti, the district recorded almost no rain on Aug 14, with duty officers reporting only intermittent drizzle at best. Yet torrents of water, rocks and mud swept down the valleys, destroying homes and orchards. The official toll here reached 70 on Thursday, with an equal number missing. CM Omar Abdullah has said it is “nearly impossible” they would be found alive.Mukhtar Ahmed, director of the meteorological centre in Srinagar, told TOI that satellite and radar data confirmed rainfall activity over Chasoti and indicated the catchment’s linkage with Ladakh’s Zanskar valley, which houses several glaciers. However, he admitted that the recorded rainfall alone was too low to account for the scale of flooding.“The nearest weather station at Gulabgarh — just 2–3 km aerially from the site—recorded only 4–5 mm of light rain on Aug 14. Such limited rainfall cannot generate a flash flood of this magnitude. It suggests something occurred in the upper catchment, possibly intense localised rainfall in several adjoining valleys, which then funneled down through a single narrow catchment valley,” Ahmed added.He also drew more parallels between Chasoti and the recent Dharali disaster. “Both areas have glaciers in their upper catchments, and in both cases, the flash floods carried down unusually large boulders of extraordinary size,” he added. Chasoti lies in Paddar valley, which borders Zanskar to the north and east. From the village, it takes a multi-day, high-altitude trek across Umasi La, at 5,300 metres, to reach Padum, the main town of Zanskar.Anand Sharma, president of the Indian Meteorological Society and former additional director general of IMD, echoed similar concerns, noting that the available rainfall data does not support the cloudburst theory. Instead, he stressed the need for improved data collection from upper catchment zones to better understand what triggered incidents like Chasoti and Dharali.“Rain-bearing clouds are typically large-scale systems. To attribute such devastation to a tiny, hyper-localised cloudburst does not align with meteorological science,” Sharma said. He added that rainfall must be examined across entire catchments, alongside closer monitoring of glaciers and unstable slopes, to accurately assess such disasters.The official reliance on “cloudburst” as a blanket explanation, researchers warn, risks obscuring the complexity of Himalayan disasters. Doppler radars may track extreme rainfall, but they cannot anticipate a glacial dam breach or a slope collapse. India’s National Disaster Management Authority has already identified dozens of potentially dangerous glacial lakes in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and J&K. Monitoring remains limited, and warnings rarely reach communities living directly in harm’s way.Amid these debates, infrastructure projects in both areas are inching forward. The government has proposed a strategic Paddar–Zanskar road to link Jammu with Ladakh. Plans include a 45 km road via Chasoti–Machail–Soomchan–Zongkhulm. A 31- km stretch from Paddar to Lossani Machail has already been sanctioned under PMGSY, along with a proposed 8-km tunnel through the mountains to Dangail.For survivors in both Dharali and Chasoti, though, scientific debates and infrastructure promises feel distant, even as they struggle to come to terms with the recent tragedy, and brace themselves for the future, in case another one strikes.","Dharali in uttarkashi was hit on aug 5, and chasoti in j&k’s kishtwar followed on aug 14.

Row Over Attack On Delhi CM Rekha Gupta, BJP Suspects Political Conspiracy By Rivals

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party 's state president Saurabh Bhardwaj on Thursday alleged that Delhi Police is withholding crucial CCTV footage related to the recent attack on chief minister Rekha Gupta during a public hearing at her Civil Lines camp office.Addressing reporters, the AAP leader said that while police promptly registered an FIR in Gupta’s case, similar seriousness was missing in earlier attacks on former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal ""We are glad that in Rekha Gupta's case, the police have registered an FIR, but I believe that the police are hiding the CCTV footage of the incident to cover up their failure,"" Bhardwaj said.He further recalled earlier incidents where Kejriwal was physically attacked during public events. “Before this, several attacks have been made on Arvind Kejriwal… While we haven’t seen CCTV footage of an attack on Rekha Gupta yet, attacks on Arvind Kejriwal were recorded and streamed everywhere.”The AAP leader alleged that police failed in their duty by not registering earlier attacks on Kejriwal as cases of attempt to murder and by not taking the accused into custody. According to him, those incidents were deliberately handled weakly, with lax security, and dismissed as acts of public anger — unlike the swift action taken in Gupta’s case.A day earlier, Bhardwaj had also expressed disappointment over the incident, stressing that violence has no place in society and goes against the principles of Mahatma Gandhi . He questioned the forces “patronising” violence, pointing out that it is not limited to attacks on political leaders but also includes instances where the police took violent action against SSC students and teachers.He also referred to a past incident when a BJP supporter attacked Arvind Kejriwal during an election campaign. At the time, Bhardwaj said, BJP leaders dismissed the attack as the act of a citizen upset with Kejriwal.""During an election program, a BJP supporter had attacked Arvind Kejriwal. At the time, the BJP said that the person was a civil defence volunteer who was upset with Arvind Kejriwal. Whenever there was an attack on Arvind Kejriwal, the BJP said that the people of Delhi were upset with him. We won't say that people of Delhi are upset with Rekha Gupta ji, and this is why an attack happened. An attack on anyone is wrong. We are supporting the BJP at this time as we believe that, in principle, violence is wrong, and all parties should condemn such an act,"" he said in a video message.The attack on Gupta took place on Wednesday morning during her weekly Jan Sunwai session. According to the Delhi CMO, the assault appeared to be part of a “well-planned conspiracy to kill her.” She was taken to hospital for a medical examination and later discharged.Police officials identified the accused as Rajesh Sakriya Khimjibhai, 41, a resident of Rajkot in Gujarat. He has been remanded to five-day police custody, with the Special Cell, Intelligence Bureau and local police jointly probing the case.

'No Big Deal If He is Tamil': DMK Blasts BJP's VP Choice CP Radhakrishnan As Political Appointment



A show of strength in Madurai:

Criticism of DMK government:

.



Tragedy on the way to the rally:

NEW DELHI: Actor-turned-politician and Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) president Vijay on Thursday declared that he would contest the 2026 Tamil Nadu assembly elections from Madurai East, launching a fiery attack on the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and asserting that his party would emerge as the principal challenger in the polls.Addressing the party’s second state conference in Madurai, Vijay likened himself to a lion marking its territory. “A lion knows how to live in a crowd and also knows how to live alone. It remains unique. A lion comes out only to hunt, not for entertainment. It always hunts only living prey...,” he said, drawing massive support from thousands of party workers who had gathered for the rally.Vijay, who formed TVK in 2024, positioned the party as an alternative to both the DMK and the opposition AIADMK , but singled out the ruling party as his main political rival. “Our only ideological enemy is BJP, our only political enemy is DMK...TVK is not a party that was started just for some political benefits...” he said.The TVK chief asserted that his party was not just another entrant in Tamil Nadu politics but a force with a distinct mission. “TVK is not a political game; it is an ideology. This is not a speech for publicity. This is a warning to those who are in power. TVK is here to dominate.Crores of people are with us. The 2026 election is a fight between TVK and DMK,” he said.""TVK is not a party that makes underground deals, forges alliances, and cheats the people. We are not afraid of anyone. The people of Tamil Nadu, the women and the youth stand with us,"" he added.He also pledged that his party would champion larger Tamil causes, vowing to “free Katchatheevu island from Sri Lanka,” a long-standing political demand in the state.Referring to repeated clashes between Tamil Nadu fishermen and the Sri Lankan Navy, he said, “800 Tamil Nadu fishermen have been attacked by the Sri Lankan Navy. To ensure the safety of our fishermen, retrieve Katchatheevu (islands) and give them to us.”The Madurai rally was billed as TVK’s biggest political mobilisation yet, with party workers thronging the venue from across the state. This conference marks the party’s second since its inception and signals Vijay’s intent to enter the 2026 elections as a serious contender.The actor-politician has repeatedly compared the upcoming polls to the historic elections of 1967 and 1977, when newcomers—DMK under CN Annadurai and AIADMK under MG Ramachandran rose to power by defeating entrenched parties. Vijay, however, differs from these leaders as he has only recently entered active politics, despite being a popular figure since 2004.Last week, he launched the “Now TVK” mobile application to drive membership across Tamil Nadu. At the launch, he urged his cadre to follow Annadurai’s principle of living with the people, learning from them and planning with them.Vijay said the party’s priority is the safety of women, elders and children, adding that a TVK government would focus on supporting groups needing special attention, such as farmers, youth, transgender people, the elderly without care, and the physically challenged.He also stressed that TVK would not engage in secret deals, opportunistic alliances, or attempts to mislead the public. According to him, the party is unafraid of challenges and enjoys strong support from the people of Tamil Nadu, particularly women and youth.TVK president also accused DMK of having a secret alliance with the BJP. ""DMK has a secret alliance with the BJP, but does drama as if they are opposing the BJP,"" he said.Slamming the Centre, Vijay pointed out on the NEET issue. He said, ""Due of your stubbornness, you continue to impose the NEET exam, and it pains me to even speak about what is happening here because of it. NEET must be abolished. Will you do this? You will never give us what we want or do what is right for us.”Directly referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he asked: “Revoke NEET! Can you do it, Narendra Modi avargal?”Vijay has in recent months sharpened his criticism of chief minister MK Stalin ’s government. In a recent post on X, he condemned the arrest of sanitation workers protesting for their rights in Chennai, calling the action “inhumane and anarchic.” He alleged that the government was acting in a “fascist” manner against ordinary people.""Condemn the fascist DMK government for arresting sanitation workers, who have been peacefully fighting for their rights, in an inhumane and anarchic manner in the dead of night!"" Vijay wrote in a post on X.Even as the rally showcased TVK’s strength, it was marred by tragedy. Prabhakaran, a 33-year-old TVK worker from Chennai, collapsed on his way to Madurai to attend the event. He had travelled overnight with friends in a van and reportedly collapsed after stepping out near Chakkimangalam.His friends rushed him to the Madurai Government Rajaji Hospital, where doctors declared him dead. The hospital dean confirmed that he was brought in an unconscious state and was later declared dead.","Tvk president vijay to contest 2026 tamil nadu assembly elections from madurai east.

"Lawyer, 27, faked disappearance to escape marriage, traced to Nepal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lawyer-27-faked-disappearance-to-escape-marriage-traced-to-nepal/articleshow/123421063.cms,"Photo/IANS

BHOPAL: A 27-year-old MP lawyer and civil judge aspirant's desperation to escape family pressure to get married led her to meticulously plan a cross-border escape from Itarsi to Nepal's Kathmandu, dodging CCTVs, toll booths and police checkpoints to ensure she didn't leave any trail leading to the life of obscurity she desired.The 13-day search for Archana Tiwari - involving multiple teams from police, GRP and NDRF - culminated Wednesday in Nepal authorities confirming that an Indian woman found living incognito in Kathmandu matched the profile of the young lawyer reported missing by her family after boarding the Indore-Katni Narmada Express on Aug 7.Investigators said her circuitous escape route took her from Itarsi, where she got off the train with an acquaintance, to Kathmandu via Shujalpur, Indore, Hyderabad, Jodhpur, Delhi and then the UP-Nepal border.Her discarded bag had been found in the B3 coach of the train, leading her brother to file a complaint with GRP Katni on Aug 8, the day after Rakshabandhan.Police said they scanned footage from over 500 CCTV cameras, deployed NDRF personnel to scour a forested patch from Barkheda to Budni, and sent divers to search a 32-km stretch of the Narmada. The breakthrough came when investigators pored through her call records.""The name Saransh Jokchand popped up during the scan. Then one thing led to another,"" an officer said. Investigators found out that Saransh travelled with Archana by the Narmada Express and carried clothes for her to change into before getting into a pre-arranged taxi.Tejinder Singh helped the lawyer avoid being captured on surveillance cameras as he was familiar with areas of the railway station outside CCTV coverage. Archana had stopped using her mobile phones before her disappearing act, police said. She handed one of her phones to Tejinder, instructing him to activate it near Midghat and then discard it.Saransh's interrogation gave police enough clues to reconstruct her escape route. ""Being a lawyer, she knew that a missing person case lodged with GRP usually doesn't get pursued aggressively. She was probably convinced the trail would go cold, little knowing that the case would get the media attention it did,"" SP (railways) Rahul Lodha said.Police found out Archana had turned down at least five marriage proposals in recent months. Her family's decision to get her married to a revenue official was purportedly the last straw.",Archana tiwari was reported missing by her family after boarding the indore-katni narmada express on aug 7.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Thursday blamed disruptions in Parliament on ""insecurities"" of a few politicians who fear getting outshone by younger MPs and are organising protests to nip the threat to their own position.At the customary informal meeting of members of different parties in LS Speaker Om Birla's office after the House was adjourned sine die, the PM reportedly said opposition's protests were bereft of merit.He said these protests were an outcome of 'insecurities' among a few opposition members - seen as a swipe at Rahul Gandhi - that they orchestrate protests and disrupt proceedings so that the young and talented are denied a chance to emerge, sources said. Modi refrained from taking names.Opposition kept away from the get together. With them skipping the meeting, one of the participants in the get together is learnt to have remarked that it has become increasingly difficult to bring Congress on board as few of its members, who govt interacts with regularly, can influence the party's decision.Modi said monsoon session covered several important bills and regretted that they could not be discussed in Parliament.On opposition parties keeping away from the meeting, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju took a swipe at them saying they might have been too ""embarrassed"" with their conduct.","Pm narendra modi blamed disruptions in parliament on ""insecurities"" of a few politicians.
