His visit has materialised exactly a week after the ruling DMK conducted its crucial general council meeting here and passing resolutions condemning the Centre.It also comes in the backdrop of a wrangle for leadership among the father-son duo in the PMK, BJP's ally, and amidst a resentment expressed by DMDK, an ally of the opposition AIADMK with whom Shah cobbled up an alliance during his April 10 visit to Chennai, over not allotting a Rajya Sabha seat to it (DMDK) as promised by the AIADMK in 2024.Further, former chief minister and ousted AIADMK leader O Panneerselvam had recently regretted that Shah had not called on him during the Chennai visit. His position like that of TTV Dhinakaran, though heading a fringe party, is still unclear about their support to the BJP's NDA.A senior leader in the BJP claimed that the disarray in the NDA camp and fissures in the PMK would not mar the poll prospects of the NDA in the state.""The differences will be sorted out soon and we will face the election as a strong force to defeat the DMK,"" state vice president M Chakravarthy said.Interestingly, Shah's visit to the state is the second one after the state chief K Annamalai was replaced by Nainar Nagenthiran, who hails from the southern district of Tirunelveli, close to Madurai.

BJP Blasts Cong For Bengaluru Stampede, CM Siddaramaiah Gives 'Kumbh' Reference | RCB | Karnataka

MYSURU/BENGALURU: Chief minister Siddaramaiah on Sunday sought to distance his govt from the 11 deaths in a stampede outside M Chinnaswamy Stadium during RCB's IPL win celebrations on June 4, saying he had okayed only the state-organised event at Vidhana Soudha where nothing untoward happened.Blaming suspended police commissioner B Dayananda, he said he was informed about the stampede at 5.45pm, almost two hours after it occurred.The CM's statements came as opposition BJP demanded a three-day special legislative session to discuss the stampede. The party also plans to meet governor Thaawarchand Gehlot and President Droupadi Murmu to seek dismissal of the Congress-led govt.Talking to reporters in Mysuru, Siddaramaiah pushed back, saying, ""Govt has done nothing wrong. Where did it happen? At the stadium. Did anything untoward happen at Vidhana Soudha? All those responsible have been suspended or taken into custody."" Four people, including an RCB top executive, have been arrested so far.The CM denied any embarrassment to his govt, though he admitted being pained. ""Such a tragedy has never occurred on my watch,"" he said, blaming RCB, Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA), and Bengaluru police for mismanaging crowd control and communication.Siddaramaiah said he was informed of the stampede only at 5.45pm. Crowds had begun to gather at Vidhana Soudha and the stadium through the afternoon and a stampede broke out . The CM said the deaths were reported at the hospital at 3.50pm. ""I'm the head of govt. Bengaluru police commissioner B Dayananda should have informed me during the Vidhana Soudha celebrations. He didn't."" The team was felicitated at Vidhana Soudha, the state legislature, after which it moved to the stadium.The CM said Dayananda, political secretary Govindraju, and ADGP (intelligence) Hemant Nimbalkar have been removed from their posts. He defended senior bureaucrats, saying chief secretary Shalini Rajneesh approved the event after police assured adequate security. The CM insisted KSCA led the Vidhana Soudha event and formally invited him. ""They told me even governor Gehlot was attending. I wasn't invited to the stadium,"" he said.BJP accused govt of ignoring security warnings and breaching norms. R Ashoka and Chaluvadi Narayanswamy - BJP's leader of opposition in the assembly and legislative council, respectively - said the party would formally write to Siddaramaiah, assembly speaker UT Khader, and council chairman Basavaraj Horatti to demand the session.Ashoka cited letters from Vidhana Soudha DCP MN Karibasavana Gowda and PWD officials warning against hosting a large crowd at the assembly complex. ""The DCP asked for CCTV cameras and an anti-drone system. None were installed,"" the BJP functionary said. He said the PWD limited the stage to 60x20ft with 25 seats, but over 200 people were present, including the CM's grandson.Ashoka said 95 BJP MLAs, including Horatti, would donate a month's salary each to compensate the 11 victims' families.",Chief minister siddaramaiah sought to distance his govt from the 11 deaths in a stampede outside m chinnaswamy stadium.

Andhra CM N Chandrababu Naidu pitches financial incentives to have more kids,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/andhra-cm-n-chandrababu-naidu-pitches-financial-incentives-to-have-more-kids/articleshow/121713034.cms,"With current fertility rate, Andhra will face serious problems: CM

VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh, which once amended its laws to bar people with more than two kids from contesting panchayat and municipal elections, now plans to incentivise having larger families as part of a strategy to combat dropping fertility rates and shift focus to what chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu terms “investment in human capital”. “I am looking at giving financial incentives by taking a family as a unit. The bigger families may get higher incentives,” Naidu told TOI ahead of completing a year in office on June 12.“As part of the ‘Zero Poverty ’ initiative, I have already rolled out an interesting model in which wealthier people will adopt poor families. This will not only bridge income disparities, but also ensure welfare of the entire family,” he said.The four-time CM, who has been an advocate of population management, said the current demographics in the southern states require govts to revisit their strategies.Fertility rates in Andhra Pradesh need to increase. At the present rate, AP will face serious problems… That is why I am thinking of bigger families,” CM N Chandrababu Naidu said. He announced recently that female employees could avail of maternity leave any number of times.“It was limited to two times only. We have removed the restrictions,” he said.The state govt also made it mandatory for every organisation to provide childcare centres at workplaces. Naidu announced financial assistance of Rs 15,000 for every schoolchild. “We give this money directly to the mothers of students. Apart from this, the NDA govt in AP is planning to announce financial assistance to couples for having more kids.” The two-child policy previously applicable to prospective candidates for panchayat and municipal polls has been reversed.In 2023, Sikkim announced incentives for indigenous people to have more children. Mizoram, too, has been encouraging tribal couples to have more than two kids. Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin said recently that with the Centre pushing for population-based delimitation of constituencies, there was a need for people in the state to have more children.","With current fertility rate, andhra will face serious problems: cm n chandrababu naidu.

The ministry has also been instructed to rework the criteria of eligibility and selection of supervision engineers, who are responsible for quality compliance during construction.These instructions, among several others, came amid instances of newly-built highways getting damaged due to poor quality work - primarily because of abnormally low prices quoted by bidders to bag projects and laxity in supervision by consultancy firms engaged by the govt.Last Dec, the PM had reviewed the ministry's performance and minutes of the meeting issued last month mentions these directions, TOI has learnt.While the ministry has amended the contract conditions to discourage abnormally low bids, it is finalising stringent norms for rating of supervision engineers. These will be rolled out in a couple of weeks.The rating will make it impossible for those scoring poorly to get work.Meanwhile, cracking down on poor performers, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has barred over a dozen construction companies and 17 consultancy firms from bidding for projects and has also imposed an around Rs 24 crore penalty on them in past two years. In a series of disciplinary action, 26 NHAI officers, including several general managers and deputy general managers, were suspended for negligence and dereliction of duty.Another 57 officers, who were on deputation, were repatriated prematurely to their parent cadre as part of the clean-up drive.In a strong message to highway builders, NHAI has also warned contractors that they will not just face penalty but will also have to bear the cost of new construction for failures.","Pm narendra modi has asked road transport ministry to formulate ""clear norms and standards"" for subcontractors engaged by main highway builders.

BENGALURU: Cops at Suryanagar station in Bengaluru Urban district were shocked when a young man entered their premises on a gearless scooter, with a severed head placed near his legs, in the wee hours of Saturday.Three police constables and an assistant sub-inspector, who were on night patrol, were standing outside the police station. They were scheduled to patrol in different directions and were getting ready to leave when the man stopped his vehicle near the station compound.A cop said: ""We asked who he was and what had brought him to the station.

How former ICICI Bank relationship manager committed fraud: 10 Points

The investigation revealed that Sakshi Gupta had gained unauthorised access to more than 110 accounts of 41 customers and executed multiple illegal transactions.

Investigators found that she had diverted the misappropriated funds into stock market investments, which subsequently resulted in substantial financial losses.

In order to hide the deception, Gupta allegedly substituted the registered mobile numbers of various bank accounts with those of her family members.

The actual account holders were unable to receive transaction notifications and one-time passwords (OTPs) due to this modification, according to police reports.

The investigation revealed multiple fraudulent activities by Gupta, including unauthorised activation of overdraft facilities across 40 accounts.

Further findings showed that she had unlawfully terminated fixed deposits belonging to 31 clients, channeling Rs 1.34 crore to different accounts.

The probe uncovered her unauthorised usage of debit cards, along with their associated PINs and OTPs, to conduct various online and ATM transactions.

Additionally, Gupta was found responsible for processing a fraudulent personal loan amounting to Rs 3.4 lakh.

The investigation also established that she had extensively utilised Insta Kiosk machines and digital banking platforms to execute numerous fraudulent transactions.

The illicit funds were distributed across several Demat accounts, suggesting an attempt to conceal the money trail.

Rs 4.58 crore siphoned off - over 100 accounts of customers accessed - fixed deposits broken: This is not some movie plot - it’s a stunning fraud that a former ICICI Bank relationship manager pulled off! The multi-crore fraud continued for over two years.The accused, Sakshi Gupta, who served at ICICI Bank ’s Shriram Nagar branch in Kota's DCM area from 2020 to 2023, was taken into custody by Udhyog Nagar police on May 31, 2025 after a thorough investigation.According to a TOI report, police records indicate that the fraudulent activities were initially discovered on February 18.Following ICICI Bank's internal probe that identified Sakshi Gupta, who previously worked as a relationship manager at the bank's DCM branch in Kota, as the primary suspect in a significant financial fraud affecting customer accounts, the Kota police have begun their enquiry. The authorities are examining potential accomplices and have asked the bank to furnish pertinent documentation.After identifying irregularities, bank manager Tarun Dadhich registered a complaint, which led to a comprehensive audit and subsequent police investigation.""She systematically transferred funds, sometimes using the account of an elderly woman who had no knowledge of the activity as a pool account,"" said sub-inspector Ibrahim of Udhyog Nagar police station.""By mid-February 2023, over Rs 3 crore had passed through that single account.""Following a one-day police custody, Gupta appeared before the court and was sent to judicial custody. The police continue their enquiries into the matter.A representative from ICICI Bank said, ""The interest of our customers are of paramount importance to us. Immediately upon discovering the fraudulent activity, we filed an FIR with the police. We have a zero-tolerance policy against any fraudulent activity and thus suspended the employee involved. We would like to reassure that genuine claims of impacted customers have been settled.""","Sakshi gupta had gained unauthorised access to more than 110 accounts of 41 customers.

'DAPR secretary gave permission for Vidhan Soudha event': Siddaramaiah

NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah on Sunday defended the decision to go ahead with the event to felicitate the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) players, despite a stampede outside the team's home ground, the Chinnaswamy Stadium.On Wednesday, a ceremony was held at the Karnataka Vidhan Soudha to felicitate RCB on clinching the Indian Premier League (IPL) title, the franchise's first since the league began in April 2008. A celebration was also held at the nearby Chinnaswamy Stadium, where a large number of fans thronged.This led to a stampede outside the ground, in which 11 people died and 56 were injured.""Actually at 3:50 pm, deaths were reported at the hospital. I got to know only at 5:45 pm. Until then, I did not know about the stampede and deaths,"" news agency PTI quoted Siddaramaiah as saying. He was speaking to reporters during a visit to Mysuru.The chief minister also clarified that the ceremony at the Vidhana Soudha was by the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA), and that he attended the programme only as an invitee.""The KSCA secretary and treasurer met and invited me. It was not organised by us (state government).They (KSCA) had, and I was invited. They told me that the governor would also come. So, I had gone. Other than that, I don't know anything. The government has nothing to do...I was not invited to the stadium event,"" the Congress leader said.""Nothing untoward happened at the Vidhana Soudha. The stampede incident happened at the stadium later,"" he added.Siddaramaiah's remarks come even as a letter by DCP (Vidhana Soudha security) to the secretary to the Karnataka government's Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms (DPAR), surfaced . The letter warned against organising the function hastily, and highlighted that the force did not have an adequate number of personnel to provide security for a ceremony where a large number of people would gather, at short notice.This in response to the DPAR seeking the DCP's opinion on holding the felicitation event on the grand stairs of the Vidhana Soudha to honour the RCB players.""RCB has a fan following across the country. Organising the event in a hurry on the grand stairs of Vidhana Soudha will lead to lakhs of cricket fans arriving there. This will lead to problems in 'bandobast' (arrangement) since there is a shortage of officers/personnel,"" the DCP's letter read.The officer further said if the function is organised, passes for visitors to Vidhana Soudha should be completely stopped.Also, as there were chances of the secretariat staff getting their family members for the event, he suggested an order aimed at ensuring this doesn't happen. The officer also sought a holiday in the afternoon for secretariat staff to ensure that they too don't come there.The DCP also called for installation of more CCTV cameras in the vicinity of Vidhana Soudha - which is a vital installation - and nearby places in view of the large gatherings expected.Siddaramaiah was asked by reporters about the letter.He replied, ""What does the letter say? The police will act according to what the government decides. It did not come to me at all. DAPR secretary has given the permission. Of course I was told.

Drug cartel's hawala cash trail ends in washing machine in Goa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/drug-cartels-hawala-cash-trail-ends-in-washing-machine-in-goa/articleshow/121700977.cms,"'Accused laundered over 2 crore of drug proceeds'

HYDERABAD: In a major breakthrough, Telangana Anti Narcotics Bureau's (TGANB) investigation to trace the inter-state hawala cash trail of international drug cartels ended in a washing machine in a Goa flat, from which it seized Rs 50 lakh a few days ago.TGANB director Sandeep Shandilya, said the money, collected over just two days, was moments away from being laundered to Nigeria. ""Had we delayed the raid by an hour, the entire amount would have been transferred. It was neatly stashed inside the washing machine, ready for dispatch,"" he said.Following a month-long surveillance operation in Goa, TGANB --- assisted by Goa police --- zeroed in on hawala transactions being conducted from Sangeetha Mobile Shop in Mapusa and an apartment in Goa's Highland Park.The key accused, Uttam Singh, who runs the mobile shop, was arrested. Investigators revealed he had laundered Rs 2.1 crore of drug proceeds in just one week.""Drug money collected in cash was handed over to Uttam, often by foreign nationals. He then moved the funds to Mumbai through informal channels, and from there, it was transferred to Nigeria,"" Shandilya explained. The investigation into the hawala trail started after Nigerian national Emmanuel Bediako, alias Maxwell, revealed it to TGANB.Between May 26 and June 1, officials tracked 58 hawala transactions involving Rs 2.1 crore. A few days after establishing this link, a raid on Highland Park apartment led to the recovery of Rs 50 lakh in cash. Over the past month, four Nigerian nationals have been arrested during TGANB operations in Goa.Authorities believe Uttam is one of several hawala operators facilitating cross-border drug money transfers. Police officials suspect a wider network of hawala operators is active, working hand-in-glove with international narcotics cartels.","'accused laundered over 2 crore of drug proceeds' in just one week.

"Supreme Court orders ex-husband to transfer house, pay Rs 50,000 monthly alimony to divorced wife, with biennial hike",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-orders-ex-husband-to-transfer-house-pay-rs-50000-monthly-alimony-to-divorced-wife-with-biennial-hike/articleshow/121708288.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant ruling that could influence future maintenance disputes, the Supreme Court has directed a man to pay his divorced wife Rs 50,000 per month as permanent alimony, with a 5% increase every two years. The top court also upheld an earlier order requiring him to clear the home loan and transfer the property to his former spouse.The Court noted that the revised amount better reflects the standard of living she enjoyed during her marriage to her former husband, a hotel management professional.The woman, who has remained unmarried and financially dependent since the divorce, was earlier receiving Rs 20,000 per month as alimony, an amount originally granted as interim maintenance. She approached the apex court seeking a revision, arguing that her former husband was now earning substantially more than he was during their separation.A bench led by Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta observed that the woman is entitled to maintain a standard of living consistent with what she had during the marriage. “The quantum of permanent alimony fixed by the High Court requires revision,” the court said, pointing to the man’s career trajectory and income history, which once reflected earnings of over Rs 21 lakh per year.“The wife, who has remained unmarried and is living independently, is entitled to a level of maintenance that reasonably secures her future”, the judgment further said.The man had argued that his current income was lower, that he had since remarried, and had additional responsibilities, including caring for elderly parents. However, the court was not convinced, stating that past and potential earning capacity must be considered in maintenance cases. It also warned against attempts to suppress income to reduce alimony obligations.The court agreed that the couple’s adult son, now 26, is no longer entitled to regular maintenance. ""It is open to the husband to voluntarily assist him with educational or other reasonable expenses,"" the judgment said.However, it clarified that his inheritance rights remain intact and he can pursue any claims under the law.The ruling brings to a close a legal battle that began in 2008, when the man filed for divorce. A trial court initially dismissed the claim, but the High Court granted divorce in 2019, citing cruelty and an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.Legal experts say the ruling strengthens the rights of women seeking dignified maintenance after divorce. Neelam Singh, Advocate-on-Record at Lucknow High Court, was quoted by ET and called it “a benchmark that reinforces the court’s role as a guardian of justice,” while Magnus Legal Services' Nikita Anand added that “maintenance is not charity but a right... calibrated to genuine financial realities.”The Apex Court clarified that income suppression tactics will not help those trying to evade maintenance. The husband’s current earnings were evaluated alongside his career history, revealing a clear ability to meet the revised obligation.","The supreme court has directed a man to pay his divorced wife rs 50,000 per month as permanent alimony, with a 5% increase every two years.

NEW DELHI: Protests continued across Manipur on Sunday following the arrest of leaders from the Meitei outfit Arambai Tenggol. Demonstrators defied prohibitory orders and clashed with security forces, prompting the administration to impose curbs and suspend internet services in five districts of the Imphal valley.In response to the unrest, the state governor held a high-level security review meeting with top officials and legislators.Meanwhile, in related news, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Sunday announced the arrest of three insurgents linked to a deadly attack on security forces in Moreh, located in Manipur’s Tengnoupal district, on January 17, 2024. The attack had claimed the lives of two police commandos and left several others injured.In a statement, the NIA said it had arrested Thangminlen Mate, identified as a key planner from the Kuki Inpi Tengnoupal (KIT) group, from Silchar in Assam on May 19. Two other individuals — Kamginthang Gangte of the Kuki National Army (KNA) and Hentinthang Kipgen, also known as Thangneo Kipgen, associated with the Village Volunteers group — were apprehended from Imphal on June 6.Also read: Protesters pour petrol over themselves after Meitei leader's arrest Protesters blocked roads by burning tyres and furniture at various locations including Uripok and Koirengei in Imphal West district, and Khurai in Imphal East.At Koirengei, agitators dug up roads and made heaps of soil to obstruct security forces.Similar protests were reported in Jiribam district, which borders Assam.Prohibitory orders have been imposed in Imphal West, Imphal East, Thoubal, Bishnupur, and Kakching districts.

Centre plans stricter law against counterfeit farm inputs including pesticides and seeds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-plans-stricter-law-against-counterfeit-farm-inputs-including-pesticides-and-seeds/articleshow/121709592.cms,"Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan at the ICAR, Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (ICAR-IIHR) campus in Bengaluru

BENGALURU: The Centre will soon introduce a stricter law to address the issue of spurious pesticides, non-genuine seeds, and counterfeit fertilisers, said Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. He was speaking to farmers at the ICAR – Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (ICAR-IIHR) campus on Sunday as part of the ongoing ‘Viksit Krishi Sankalp Abhiyan’. This initiative aims to connect scientists with farmers under the Centre’s ‘lab to land’ programme. It was his first visit to South India during the campaign, which began on May 29.“Those who are involved in selling fake seeds and pesticides will be severely punished,” said Chouhan, referring to several complaints by farmers in many states.The farmers’ concerns were highlighted in a 2015 study by Ficci, which revealed the loss of over 10 million tonnes of food production due to the use of spurious pesticides that year. It also showed that the value of fake pesticides was growing at 20% per year, with states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Haryana, and Karnataka being among the worst affected.Although the sale of fake or substandard seeds, pesticides, and fertilisers is a punishable offence under existing laws, the absence of proper monitoring and accountability does not yield the desired results on the ground.The new law is expected to address these enforcement gaps.During his speech, Chouhan also promised to introduce a scheme to reduce farmers’ transportation costs for tomatoes, onions, and potatoes. This would ensure they receive a fair price for their produce without losing money to middlemen who take a significant cut in delivering the farm produce to the desired destination.Under the scheme, the Centre will collaborate with states to bear the transport costs, involving agencies that procure from farmers and deliver the produce to markets in other states.The minister’s farm visits to rural areas near Bengaluru on Sunday were part of the fortnight-long campaign to connect with farmers and gather first-hand information on their day-to-day farm-related problems.“The central govt will collaborate with states, Agricultural Universities, Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), farmers, and scientists to draw a comprehensive roadmap to improve farming operations and achieve the goal of developing India as the world’s food basket,” said Chouhan while addressing the gathering of farmers and farm scientists. He stated that the ‘Abhiyan’ envisions “One Nation, One Agriculture, One Team” to work for the farmers’ interests.In Karnataka, more than 70 interdisciplinary teams comprising scientists and officials from agriculture and allied departments have been visiting farms daily since May 29. These teams are recording feedback directly from farmers to shape need-based, problem-oriented agricultural research programmes.","The centre will soon introduce a stricter law to address the issue of spurious pesticides, non-genuine seeds, and counterfeit fertilisers, said union agriculture minister shivraj singh chouhan.
