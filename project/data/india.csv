MUMBAI: A joint team of forest department and BMC officials inspected actor Shah Rukh Khan 's bungalow, Mannat, at Bandra Bandstand, on Friday following a complaint about coastal regulation zone (CRZ) violations during renovation of the property.The property comprises Mannat, a heritage structure, and an annex structure, a multi-storey building. As Khan and his family have shifted to a nearby place due to the renovation, the officials were met by his staff who told them they would submit all documents concerning the permissions obtained.Pooja Dadlani, Khan's manager, said ""There are no complaints. All work is going on as per guidelines.""The property is undergoing renovation, and clearances were earlier sought from the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) for it. The renovation included adding two additional floors to the annexe structure.A forest department official said, ""A team carried out a site inspection as we received a complaint about renovation permissions. A report will be prepared based on findings and submitted soon.""An official, who was part of the team, said the staff present at the site told them they would submit all documents concerning the permissions obtained.The BMC's H-West ward building and factory department and the building proposal department officials were asked to accompany the forest team for carrying out the inspection. ""Our officials were accompanying the team, based on a request by the forest department. We had no other role,"" said a BMC official.Activist Santosh Daundkar had earlier lodged a complaint with the BMC regarding the construction at Mannat.Former IPS officer and lawyer Y P Singh Friday alleged the layout of Mannat comprised one main heritage building called Villa Vienna as per the heritage regulations. ""The name of this building was changed to Mannat later. In 2005, an extension building of seven floors was made behind the heritage bungalow and since at that time Urban Land Ceiling Act was in force, a large apartment could not have been made. To overcome this legal hurdle, approval for 12 small independent flats was taken from the BMC by the owners namely Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan. However, once the approval was obtained, all these 12 small flats, which were essentially meant for mass housing under the Act, were merged and a super luxury accommodation of a single family was constructed,"" said Singh.","A joint team of forest department and bmc officials inspected actor shah rukh khan's bungalow, mannat, at bandra bandstand, on friday.

Chandigarh gets distinction

NEW DELHI: The performance gap in school education between India's top and bottom-ranking states and Union territories has narrowed from 51% in 2017-18 to 42% in the 2023-24 cycle, according to the education ministry's latest performance grading index (PGI) 2.0, suggesting that many states are catching up with the better performers.Yet, the report underscores a significant concern - none of the 36 states and UTs have reached the top four performance grades of Daksh, Utkarsh, Atti-Uttam, and Uttam. Chandigarh, with a score of 703 out of 1,000, is the only entity to enter the Prachesta-1 band (701-760), with most of the states/UTs still in lower bands.Among states, Punjab led with 631.2 points, followed by Delhi (623.7), Gujarat (614.4), and Odisha (595.6). At the bottom end were Meghalaya (417.9), Arunachal Pradesh (461.4), Mizoram (464.3), Nagaland (468.6), and Bihar (472.0), all placed in Akanshi-2 or Akanshi-3, the lowest performance tiers.PGI 2.0 evaluates school education systems across 73 indicators in six domains - learning outcomes, access, infrastructure and facilities, equity, governance processes, and teacher education & training - assigning each state and UT a score out of 1,000.Grades range from Daksh (top) to Akanshi-3 (bottom), based on performance on these indicators, which are derived from sources such as UDISE+, NAS 2021, PRABANDH, PM Poshan and Vidyanjali.As many as 25 states and UTs are currently in the Akanshi category (scores below 580), indicating acontinuing need for systemic improvements. At the same time, this represents a slight improvement from the 28 states/UTs in Akanshi category in 2022-23. Also, the highest grade attained has moved from Prachesta-2 to Prachesta-1.""The narrowing of the inter-state performance gap is a testament to the collective efforts of states and our commitment to cooperative federalism in education,"" said Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan. ""PGI 2.0 reflects the transformational impact of NE, which has empowered states to pursue evidence-based reforms.""The best performers over a two-year period were Himachal Pradesh (up 41 points to 573.8), Telangana (up 22.6 points to 511.9), Chandigarh (up 15.2 to 703), Odisha (up 11.1 to 595.6) and Goa (up 8.4 to 589.7). Delhi recorded the sharpest single-year rise - 44.4 points - driven largely by improvements in school infrastructure and teacher training. However, its 2021-22 score was not published, making it ineligible for the two-year comparative analysis.In contrast, Chhattisgarh posted the steepest decline, falling 38.6 points from 533.2 to 494.6 due to slippage in governance and equity indicators. West Bengal dropped by 14 points and Tamil Nadu registered a marginal fall of 4.5 points.A domain-wise breakdown highlights both the strengths and weaknesses of major states. Kerala, for example, stood out by becoming the only state to achieve Daksh in the teacher education & training domain, scoring 91.4 out of 100 - reflecting its consistent investment in teacher quality and professional development. Odisha showed strong equity outcomes, with one of the highest scores in bridging gender, caste, and regional disparities. Gujarat, with an overall score of 614.4, excelled in governance (87.8/130) and teacher training (83.3/100), but lagged in learning outcomes.Bihar, a state which faces longstanding educational challenges, showed some improvement in access and teacher training but continued to struggle with infrastructure, scoring only 55 out of 190 - placing it in Akanshi-1 for that domain. Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, moved up to Akanshi-1 grade with 528.1 points, driven by better equity and teacher indicators, though governance remained a weak domain.Maharashtra (582.0) entered Prachesta-3 band with gains in equity and teacher training but needs to improve in infrastructure and governance. Tamil Nadu (559.2), despite a legacy of educational progress, saw a dip in its overall score and domain-wise fall in governance and teacher metrics.The report concluded that while progress is evident, states still have significant ground to cover. ""The highest grade achieved so far is only Prachesta-1, and all states/UTs still have considerable work to do to reach the 1,000-point benchmark,"" the ministry said. And whether they do so or not will reflect in future PGI 2.0 scores, which remain a critical monitoring and reform tool under NE to help align education systems with Sustainable Development Goal 4.","The performance gap in school education between india's top and bottom-ranking states and union territories has narrowed. Chandigarh, with a score of 703 out of 1,000, is the only entity to enter the prachesta-1 band. Punjab led with 631.2 points, followed by delhi (623.7), gujarat (614.4), and odisha (595.6).","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121985807,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-65636,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The city will likely welcome the southwest monsoon by June 24. According to the India Meteorological Department's forecast, given the pace at which the monsoon is advancing, it is likely to arrive three days before the normal onset of the rainy season in the capital.Happily, the forecast is for a normal monsoon this season. IMD has predicted that while the country is expected to receive above-normal rainfall, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and UP will, as a meteorological region, receive normal rainfall in the range of 92-108% of the long-period average.""Conditions are favourable for further advance of the southwest monsoon over the remaining parts of the north Arabian Sea, some more parts of Rajasthan, remaining parts of West Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and some parts of Jammu & Kashmir-Gilgit-Baltistan-Muzaffarabad, and some more parts of Ladakh during the next two days,"" said IMD's Friday bulletin. ""Conditions are also becoming favourable for further advance of the southwest monsoon over the remaining parts of J&K, Ladakh; some parts of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi in the subsequent two days. ""Last year, the monsoon arrived in Delhi on June 25 with the highest single-day precipitation since 1936 of 228.1mm. The season, however, ended with a 19% deficiency.

The humidity, which was between 65% and 87%, however, kept the discomfort level high. The heat index, or 'feel like' temperature, therefore, was 46.1 degrees CelsiusIMD has issued a yellow alert and predicts rain from Friday to Monday. The forecast is for generally cloudy sky and very light to light rain/thunderstorm/lighting accompanied by gusty winds with speed of 30-40kmph temporarily reaching 50kmph during thunderstorms.The maximum and minimum temperatures in the city are likely to be 35-37°C and 26-28°C, respectively, on Saturday. The minimum temperature will be near normal, and the maximum temperature will be below normal by 1-3°C. IMD said the predominant surface wind would likely blow from the southeast direction with a wind speed of less than 15kmph during the morning hours. The wind speed will gradually decrease and slow down to 10-12 kmph from the southeast direction in the afternoon. The wind will pick up some speed and reach around 15kmph from the southeast direction by the evening and night, said the IMD forecast.On Friday, the air was more or less breathable with the air quality index in the 'satisfactory' category.

Woman deboarded after alert from flight captain

2 Air India Flights Cancelled, One Mumbai-Bound Plane Grounded In Kolkata Over Engine Snag





BENGALURU: A 36-year-old doctor was arrested on Tuesday after she created ruckus aboard an Air India Express flight from Bengaluru to Surat and allegedly threatened to crash the aircraft when cabin crew objected to her placing baggage in a restricted area near the crew cabin.The incident delayed the flight by two hours and led to a security scare. The accused, identified as Vyas Hiral Mohanbhai, from Shivanahalli near Yelahanka, was travelling alone on AI Flight IX2749 with two pieces of baggage.Also read: Air India cuts frequencies across North America, UK, EU, Far East & Australia 'at least' till July 15 According to police, the Ayurvedic doctor bypassed the check-in counter, insisting on carrying both bags on board. The situation escalated after Mohanbhai boarded the flight and left one of her bags near the crew cabin while taking the other to her seat, 20F.When the cabin crew asked her to keep the bag in the overhead compartment near her seat, she refused and insisted they keep it with them. Despite repeated requests by the crew and later the captain, Mohanbhai refused to comply and began abusing the staff.The confrontation soon involved fellow passengers, who also tried to reason with her, but she reportedly shouted at them. At one point, she allegedly threatened to crash the flight if the crew moved her baggage.With the situation spiralling, the captain alerted security and called CISF personnel, who boarded the aircraft and offloaded her.The incident took place between 2.45pm and 5.30pm, according to a complaint filed by Agnimitra Bahinipati, associate manager of security at KIA. Police said Mohanbhai did not stop there. Once taken to KIA police station, she continued to abuse and manhandle police officers, creating further disturbance. “This was the first time we heard such abusive language in the station,” a senior officer claimed.Her husband, who works in an educational institution in the city and hails from Odisha, appeared before police. He informed them that Mohanbhai had stopped practising medicine and was en route to Gujarat to visit her family.He reportedly told police she had created disturbances in public spaces in the past. Police are now verifying her background and previous incidents.","Vyas hiral mohanbhai, 36, was travelling alone on ai flight ix2749 with two pieces of baggage.

Delhi Judge Cash Row: SC Probe Panel Report Says Misconduct Proved, Proposes Justice Varma’s Removal

NEW DELHI: The inquiry committee on the Justice Varma cash case has rejected both theories put forth by the HC judge in his defence - that the cash could have been planted in the storeroom of his residence and that the storeroom was set afire by an act of arson to implicate him.The committee, constituted on March 22 by then CJI Sanjiv Khanna, comprised seasoned constitutional court judges - Punjab and Haryana Chief Justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Justice Anu Sivaraman.It examined 55 witnesses, including Justice Varma, which were video recorded, to confirm every report of TOI on the sensational controversy. The panel's report also referred to TOI's March 21 story breaking the news.Also read: SC panel proposes impeachment of Justice Yashwant Varma - What probe report said Rejecting Justice Varma's defence - that ""someone could have planted the cash in the storeroom in his absence as it was accessible to everyone"" - the panel in its 64-page report said, ""The overall control and the permission to have access to the storeroom was undeniably with Justice Varma.""This should remove all doubts about the launch of proceedings for removal of the HC judge in the monsoon session of Parliament beginning on July 21.The panel cited the fact that the judge was in control of the Tughlaq Crescent bungalow to reject his defence of conspiracy and arson - essentially that someone with mala fide intention planted the cash at his official bungalow and then set off the fire. Referring to statements of security personnel, the panel noted that no one could access the house without the permission of family members and ""therefore, it's well nigh impossible for currency to be planted in the storeroom of a sitting judge, which is being monitored by static 1+4 guard and a PSO stationed at the gate at all time, apart from the fact that the house abounds with a large number of old and trusted domestic servants with over six staff quarters"".The committee also disregarded the theory of ""arson"" - ""a criminal act of deliberately setting fire to property"" - belatedly flagged by Justice Varma. Members of the panel said that by the judge's own initial version, the fire was triggered by a short circuit, besides noting that he did not follow up by registering a police complaint.Significantly, the panel also underlined that the judge had quietly accepted his transfer to Allahabad HC, in the wake of publication of a report in TOI. ""The categorical acceptance on March 20, immediately, without any demur and, respectfully accepting the decision of repatriation to Allahabad would, in normal circumstances, only be done after discussion with family members at least and after an attempt to find out the reason for transfer, having served in Delhi HC for the last three years,"" the report said.""It is his categorical case that he has served diligently for a decade without any complaint. Thus, he would have liked to find out the reason for the transfer,"" it added.In conclusion, the inquiry panel said, ""In the absence of any plausible explanation coming from Justice Varma or his family members or, for that matter, any other witness, this committee is left with no option but to hold that the trust reposed in him was belied by him by allowing highly suspicious material in the shape of piles of currency notes to be stashed in the storeroom. Whether this stashing was done with tacit or explicit consent of Justice Varma or his family members is of little significance in the face of the larger concept of breach of public trust and probity expected of the high constitutional office held by Justice Varma. ""The committee repeatedly termed the post-cash discovery conduct of Justice Varma as ""unnatural"" and ""illogical"" and said, ""Keeping in view the direct and electronic evidence on record, this committee is firmly of the view that there is sufficient substance in the allegations raised in the letter of CJI (Sanjiv Khanna) dated March 22 and the misconduct found proved is serious enough to call for initiation of proceedings for removal of Justice Yashwant Varma. ""The committee also found it odd that the judge, who cut short his vacation in the Satpura forests after having been informed of the fire, did not deem it fit to visit the site until March 15 when the principal private secretary to the Delhi HC chief justice came for an inspection.The committee also stated that Justice Varma's daughter tried to dissuade firemen from entering the bungalow by telling them that the flames had already been controlled.The report said Justice Varma's private secretary, Delhi HC employee Rajinder Singh Karki, frantically tried to reach the judge on phone from the residence. ""He had a detailed conversation with Justice Varma at 1.23am on March 15"" when the judge asked him to stay back at the residence, the report said.It was Karki who instructed firemen not to mention burnt cash in their report, the panel said. It also found from the security guard's statement that Karki and a trusted servant, Mohd Rahil ""were busy supervising the cleaning up job after the fire wagons had left"".During questioning by the committee, Karki entangled himself in contradictory statements, the report said.The committee was also surprised to find that CCTV footage had been wiped out from the hard disc between March 15 and March 25, when the inquiry started.","The inquiry committee on the justice varma cash case has rejected both theories put forth by the hc judge in his defence. The committee, constituted on march 22 by then cji sanjiv khanna, comprised seasoned constitutional court judges.

BHUBANESWAR: PM Modi Friday said he had to say 'no' to US President Donald Trump's invitation to drop by in Washington on his way back from Canada, where he had gone for the G7 summit, as he did not want to miss his scheduled visit to the ""land of Lord Jagannath"", reports Ashok Pradhan.While Majhi's first anniversary as CM was on June 12, the Odisha govt timed the main celebration on Friday in sync with the PM's schedule. Any change in plan could have put the govt in an awkward position in a state where BJP swept the Lok Sabha polls, winning 20 of the 21 seats, and stormed into office by winning 78 of the 147 assembly seats.Speaking at a rally in Bhubaneswar to mark one year of Mohan Charan Majhi-led BJP govt in Odisha, PM Modi said, ""The President of United States called me, saying, 'Since you are in Canada, please come over. We will have a meal together and talk.' I thanked him and politely declined, saying that visiting the land of Mahaprabhu (Lord Jagannath) was essential for me. The devotion for Mahaprabhu and your love drew me here.""In what was Modi's sixth visit to the state in the past one year, the PM praised Odisha's progress under the BJP govt, emphasising the state's role in India's cultural and economic development. He highlighted initiatives aimed at improving infrastructure, healthcare, and economic opportunities for the people of Odisha, particularly tribal communities.Attacking the previous Congress regimes, the PM said the party which governed India for decades had neglected the tribal community and ""used them merely for political benefits"".He said over 125 tribal-dominated districts were affected by Maoists for years. ""Most of these districts were declared backward, and the then govts did not take the responsibility to develop them,"" Modi said. In contrast, the BJP-led govt freed tribal society from Naxal violence, ushering in development in these areas.The PM also highlighted the role of eastern India in the country's growth trajectory. ""The development of 21st century India will gain momentum from eastern India. This is the era of Purvodaya.""","Narendra modi says he had to say 'no' to us president donald trump's invitation to drop by in washington on his way back from canada.

India’s gone from despair to optimism in 11 yrs: Home minister Amit Shah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-gone-from-despair-to-optimism-in-11-yrs-home-minister-amit-shah/articleshow/121982688.cms,"Union home minister Amit Shah

The Modi govt has completed 11 years in office. What would you count as the five biggest achievements?

But some of the issues raised in 2014 — poverty, inflation and unemployment — have not gone away…

It was a deliberate attempt to sabotage peace in Kashmir, to stop rising tourism and distract Kashmiri youth, who were employed, enjoying prosperity and were distanced from terrorism. The youth in Kashmir realises the evil plan. There were protests in every town in the Valley after the attack on tourists. The Valley had not shown such solidarity with the country before Amit Shah

Congress

says your performance on the economic front is underwhelming.

What about ‘Make in India’ as imports still remain high?

Disaffection with UPA’s performance on the internal security front helped BJP in 2014. How do you view the situation now?

The success against Naxals wouldn’t have happened overnight…

But the Pahalgam attack was a major setback. Congress has blamed the govt for it.

The situation in Manipur is not of terrorism, nor is it an anti-national issue. It is related to ethnic tension. Today, there is no atmosphere of violence, but the rift between the two communities (Meiteis and Kukis) has not been healed. We are seeking to bring about reconciliation; we invited them separately and then asked them together, and now we are discussing this at the political level. We are hopeful of success soon Amit Shah

Was the Pahalgam attack an act of desperation by Pakistan?

There has been a radical shift in approach towards terrorism as the govt has said that any terrorist attack from now on will be considered an act of war.

Do you see the possibility of fresh attempts by Pakistan to disrupt normalcy?

Are more steps required to reassure tourists?

What is the roadmap for granting statehood to J&K? What are the factors that will be borne in mind?

Congress is making an issue of the decision to pause Operation Sindoor.

No one will have any reason to complain when the delimitation exercise is conducted. We will establish a very good balance and no one will be dissatisfied. DMK is raising the issue only because of the 2026 assembly elections. Delimitation is not going to happen by then, and they know this. The 2029 elections will be held with women’s reservation Amit Shah

The opposition has been raising the issue of losses we suffered during Operation Sindoor...

Indus Waters Treaty has been kept in abeyance, not fully annulled. Will it be restored in future?

So you mean status quo ante will not be restored?

What is your assessment of the situation in

Manipur

?

When is an elected govt likely to be restored?

It has been alleged that in its third term, the Modi govt has been making key decisions under pressure, such as the one on caste census.

The opposition has said that the govt notification does not mention caste census.

But the PM had earlier opposed it and you had said this was an attempt to divide Hindus.

By when should we expect the Census numbers?

Is delimitation a possibility before the 2029 elections?

The southern states have concerns around delimitation. How do you propose to balance that with the demand of northern states that their representation in Parliament should be proportionate to their numbers?

BNS has been enacted, how far have you progressed with implementing it?

An infiltrator has to leave India. Our country is not a dharamshala. If you need to visit India, you must obtain a valid visa from our embassy. Whatever the perception or political colour, the country’s security is paramount Amit Shah

There were attempts to integrate various aspects through e-courts and e-prisons.

Infiltration has been a major issue and steps have been taken in recent months. The govt has been accused of communal bias in dealing with it.

Communal violence appears to have decreased…

But Bengal seems to be an outlier?

In Delhi, are you happy with the work done by the govt in the first 100 days?

Drugs have emerged as a major concern. How are you tackling the issue?

What about the new BJP president?

Will you be able to repeat the electoral successes of Maharashtra and Haryana in Bihar, West Bengal and Kerala, especially with anti-incumbency factor against Nitish Kumar?

There is a debate around language in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

Southern states have raised the issue of lower fund transfer and the formula being skewed against them. How do you view it?

Are you hopeful of a favourable verdict from the Supreme Court on the waqf law?

There is an effort to remove Justice Yashwant Varma. Is the govt seeking to use the opportunity for a National Judicial Appointments Commission-type body? Will we see some action during the monsoon session?

Will the same keenness be shown in the case of Justice Shekhar Yadav?

Let’s not get caught in numbers... certain things cannot be quantified. There was widespread pessimism in 2014, and people voted for Modi ji as PM, seeking an end to corruption, weak internal and external security, a severe image deficit abroad, social disharmony, and the poor state of the economy, which had landed us in the unenviable ‘Fragile Five’ club. The youth were particularly apprehensive. Now, in 2025, people are confident that India will become a developed country by 2047. The transformed mindset is a result of hard work over 11 years, marked by farsightedness and microplanning. I consider the renewal of hope and confidence about the country’s future a significant achievement. We are marching ahead with a sense of encouragement derived from the changed national psyche.Let us be real. There are some issues which cannot be eliminated altogether. But can anyone say that the level of poverty and the number of poor are the same, or that their status has not changed? Over 26 crore people have been moved out of the BPL category, and more than 80 crore have benefited from welfare schemes, including housing, water, electricity, toilets and free LPG connections. Free health insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh, 5 kg of free ration and free LPG connections are available.These things had not been provided for in 70 years; in these 11 years, we have come a long way.Can India’s rise to becoming the fourth largest economy from the 10th, surpassing six front-running nations in just 11 years, be termed an underwhelming performance? Is doubling of GDP from $2 trillion to $4.2 trillion underperformance? Isn’t the unprecedented rise of capital expenditure from Rs 1.9 lakh crore to Rs 10.5 lakh crore a marker of the nation’s stupendous growth? Since they demitted office, even per capita income has risen from Rs 68,572 to Rs 133,488 and transformed lives for good. And all these are besides the remarkable 143% jump in FDI, which is reflective of international confidence in India’s economic policies. I can go on. Average inflation rate has been brought down from 10.1% to 4.6% and forex reserves have more than doubled to $654 billion. On the infrastructure front, the pace of highway construction has accelerated, Metro rail network has expanded four-fold to 1,000 km. In the banking sector, the turnaround is equally impressive. When we took office, non-performing assets were in double digits. Today, it is just 2.3%. As part of a historic push for financial inclusion, over 55 crore bank accounts have been opened in the last 11 years. Through Direct Benefit Transfer, Rs 44 lakh crore has been disbursed. Today, India accounts for nearly 50% of global digital transactions. Clearly, development under the Modi govt is not just a claim — it is a lived reality of 140 crore citizens.Considerable progress has been made towards Aatmanirbharta. We manufactured defence products worth Rs 1.3 lakh crore and exported Rs 21,000 crore worth of defence products. The target is to increase it to Rs 50,000 crore by 2029. We are now the second-largest exporter of mobile phones — from 26% mobiles being domestically produced, the share is now over 99%. Modi ji’s push to the toy sector has not only ensured that our next generation grows up playing with indigenously manufactured toys but has also reversed the export-import ratio of toys. In 2014, only 20% of toys were manufactured indigenously, 40% of manufacturing units had shut down, and 20% of them were on the verge of shutting down.The biggest challenge was govt’s approach. Earlier, the focus was on containing the problem; our approach has been to eliminate it. Earlier, the concern was to manage a threat somehow while you were in office. It was not helpful. Take, for example, the issue of Naxalism. They had a plan to develop a red corridor from Tirupati (Andhra Pradesh) to Pashupatinath (Nepal), and the threat appeared realistic to many. In 11 years, the challenge has shrunk from 123 districts to just six. I am confident that by March 31, 2026, the entire country will be free of the Naxal menace. Similarly, in the North-east, violence has come down almost 70%, not only by using force. We have negotiated over 20 peace agreements with insurgent groups, and over 10,000 people have surrendered. By the time the report for the year is released, the level of violence is likely to decrease by 90%.By 2020, we began to choke off their supplies, whether it was money, arms or food. We set up over 500 camps, approximately every 8 km, to fill the security vacuum. Forces could now go out in the morning and return by evening after completing an operation. This helped reduce casualties significantly. Besides, we used the camps to distribute grains and medicine to the local population, which eroded the Naxals’ support base. We also enhanced communication systems, utilising the latest technology, including drones that capture the chatter. Most states extended support, regardless of which party was in office. The Congress govt of Chhattisgarh was an exception. It refused to act, and so, the Naxals converged there. Initially, I found it to be a challenge. But it turned into an opportunity. First, a BJP govt was formed there. Second, it became possible to strike the Naxals since they were all located in one place.It needs to be analysed differently. There was a time when 70% of terrorists killed in the Valley would be Indians from Kashmir, while 30% were from Pakistan . Now, that ratio stands at 5:95, which means that if you leave out the Pakistan element, then the homegrown component has almost come to an end. We decided to look at the root of local recruitment. It was fuelled by discontent over rigged polls and corruption that resulted in lack of development. Article 370 was another important factor, as it gave people a sense that they could break away. Nullification of the provision ended that subterranean feeling, with people realising that India is their sole destiny. Free and fair polls at all levels — from local bodies to Parliament — were conducted. Even opponents have not questioned their fairness and so the perception that elections are a sham and managed by Delhi gave way to a sense that the future of a village gets decided only by its residents. Efforts were made to promote Kashmir’s local products. As a result, the enlistment in terrorism decreased. At the same time, there is zero tolerance for terrorists. Funeral procession of a slain terrorist is not allowed, and he is buried where he gets killed. Sympathisers of terrorists have been punished and weeded out from govt jobs, while those involved in stone pelting are debarred from govt jobs. This is why movie theatres have resumed and there are night screenings after 33 years. Tazia procession was taken out after 32 years and Krishna Janmashtami was celebrated at Lal Chowk, where Army had to guard Murli Manohar Joshi ji and Modi ji when they went to unfurl the tricolour there. As for Pakistan-sponsored terrorism that you mentioned in the context of the Pahalgam attack, we have a clear policy: be it Uri, Pulwama or Pahalgam, we have given a strong reply, and today, through your interview, I want to ask Congress, what used to happen during their time? How can Congress question us on the issue of terrorism? It used to do nothing except change a minister. Of all political parties, Congress certainly has no right to criticise us.It was a deliberate attempt to sabotage peace in Kashmir, to stop rising tourism and distract Kashmiri youth, who were employed, enjoying prosperity and were distanced from terrorism. The youth in Kashmir realises the evil plan. There were protests in every town in the Valley after the attack on tourists. The Valley had not shown such solidarity with the country before.Yes, PM Modi has said so repeatedly, there should not be any confusion about it.We cannot control what they are planning but any misdeed of theirs will be responded to with full force. We will not hesitate in acting against whatever Pakistan chooses to do, without any delay.No special effort is required. Tourists have resumed their travel and we will soon be able to reach earlier levels.The PM has stated this in his Independence Day speech, and I have said in both Houses of Parliament that J&K will be granted the status of a state at an appropriate time. There should be no doubt about that.In line with the PM’s public declaration to punish terrorists responsible for the Pahalgam attack, we launched limited strikes on terror launchpads and made it very clear that was a targeted strike. Pakistan treated our strike on terrorists as an attack on its territory, ending the distinction. It attacked our civilian locations. We gave a befitting reply on May 10 by damaging their airbases, while sparing civilian areas. Within no time, Pakistan sought a suspension of strikes.I will only say that when the country is facing hostilities, one should refrain from saying things which hurt the morale of our armed forces, who have done a sterling job. Our agencies gave precise coordinates of specific targets for our forces to strike them with full force. Our scientists also deserve praise for developing weapons systems that proved so effective.No, it will never be restored. International treaties can’t be annulled unilaterally but we had the right to put it in abeyance, which we have done. The treaty preamble mentions that it was for peace and progress of the two countries but once that has been violated, there is nothing left to protect.We will use water that rightfully belongs to India. Paani Rajasthan tak jayega.We will take the water that was flowing to Pakistan to Rajasthan by constructing a canal. Pakistan will be starved of water that it has been getting unjustifiably.The situation in Manipur is not of terrorism, nor is it an anti-national issue. It is related to ethnic tension. We had an open border with Myanmar and when that country faced instability, infiltration started. Then the court order (on Meiteis also deserving quotas) triggered a spark. We need to keep in mind that in all the previous cases of ethnic violence in Manipur, the situation could be stabilised only after threefour years. Today, there is no atmosphere of violence, but the rift between the two communities (Meiteis and Kukis) has not been healed. We are seeking to bring about reconciliation; we invited them separately and then asked them to come together, and now we are discussing this at the political level. We are hopeful of success soon.Until the differences between the two communities are sorted, it will be difficult. Peace is very important.This decision was not taken under pressure. The Modi govt has made the most significant contributions to inclusive and balanced development, encompassing both social and regional dimensions. Most of the poor are Dalit, backwards and minorities, and a larger part of the budget has been allocated to them. There is no bigger anti-OBC party than Congress; they tried to suppress the Kalelkar Commission report, and they did the same with the Mandal Commission. When the recommendations of the Mandal Commission were implemented by a non-Congress govt, Rajiv Gandhi gave the longest speech as leader of opposition, a record that has not been broken also because you don’t have such leaders of opposition now.Caste count will be part of the Census, period. The PM has said so and there have been three press releases.We did say that it is an attempt to divide society. But we also decided to blunt it by agreeing to the demand. Our goal is to keep everyone united.They should be available towards the end of 2027, may be a few months earlier as we are deploying a lot of technology. Instead of five to six years in the past, it may take five to six months.The 2029 elections will be held with women’s reservation.No one will have any reason to complain when the exercise is conducted. We will establish a very good balance and no one will be dissatisfied. DMK is raising the issue only because of the 2026 assembly elections. Delimitation is not going to happen by then, and they know this.The three laws (IPC, Indian Evidence Act and CrPC) were enacted by the British to preserve their rule. The idea was to protect their forces, their property and their own security. We have kept people’s interests at the forefront. We have provided for technological changes that will remain relevant for a century; the definition of an e-document will remain unchanged, despite changes in technology from floppy disks to pen drives, for instance. It allows for e-hearing and e-arguments, and the entire chargesheet can be filed electronically, making the process paperless. Forensics have been made compulsory for several offences; videography of search and seizures is also compulsory. We have provided timelines to ensure that justice is available promptly, and rights have been provided to victims. Along with all this, there is computerisation of police stations, and multiple types of databases will be available, such as those related to narcotics or terrorism. In two years, our legal system will be the most modern in the world. The improvement in Assam shows that we are on track to reach the global average of convictions.There is an arrangement called ICJS. Legacy data has been added, and 95% of the integration is nearly complete. A common software will be introduced by Sept, connecting all police stations, forensic labs, prosecution wings, courts and prisons.Lies should not deter us from doing the right thing. An infiltrator has to leave India. Our country is not a dharamshala. If you need to visit India, you must obtain a valid visa from our embassy. Whatever the perception or political colour, the country’s security is paramount.That is because we (BJP) are in office in most states.Things will improve there too after the next electionsRekha ji’s govt has made a very strong start, whether it is on health, ration cards, tackling water issues, cleaning and development of Yamuna. Her govt has started work on stopping revenue loss. You can’t do much more in 100 days. We have been able to successfully convey to officers that they have to work hard.For any fight, infrastructure is crucial and that is in place now. There is a fourlevel arrangement — at the national level, between state and central, in districts and it is now going to the level of DySPs and police. Apart from Bengal and Kerala, states have also set up narcotics control wings. We have managed to step up recoveries, laws have been strengthened, we can attach property, keep people in jail for longer duration, now police stations can test samples. Over the next five-six months, we will strike on cartels in a very coordinated way.It will happen soon.We will post convincing wins in Bihar, Tamil Nadu and Bengal. We are confident of victory in Tamil Nadu.It’s been raised in Tamil Nadu due to the polls. The public has clarity on the issue, and Indian languages have a bright future.This is propaganda. Between 2004 and 2014, Rs 18.3 lakh crore was given as grants to states, and between 2014 and 2024, it was Rs 70 lakh crore. This aligns with the population of states.Absolutely. The law is entirely in line with the Constitution. The objective is not to offend or hurt religious sentiments in any way, but to eradicate corruption and make the operation of waqf transparent through the use of technologyThere is no thinking within the govt (on NJAC-type body). For us, corruption is a major issue and when the Chief Justice of India in a letter has acknowledged Varma’s culpability, then there is no reason to doubt. I am hoping that the removal happens unanimously.It is not a corruption case, it is a case about conduct (of a judge), which is not within the purview of an elected govt, it has to be decided by the Supreme Court. Corruption and misconduct are two distinct issues with clearly defined boundaries.","Union home minister amit shah has completed 11 years in office.

""Issuance of such illegal notices and summons to senior advocates and to the advocate-on-record reflect a disturbing trend, striking at the very foundations of the legal profession and undermining the independence of the bar, which is a core pillar of Indian democracy,"" it said, calling upon ED to respect independence of bar and exercise restraint.SCAORA requested the CJI to ""examine the legality and propriety of such summons issued to legal professionals for opinions rendered in good faith; safeguard the constitutional and professional protections accorded to advocates; and lay down guidelines to prevent further erosion of professional protection to lawyer-client communications and uphold independence of bar"".SCAORA said the unwarranted steps taken by ED against senior advocates for discharge of their professional duty set a ""dangerous precedent"" that could have a chilling effect on the entire legal fraternity and dissuade them from giving honest and independent legal opinions to clients.Bar Association of India, too, criticised ED and said, ""Issuance of summons is also an egregious example of overreach by the agency and is an attempt to undermine attorney-client privilege protected under the provisions of BSA.""","Sections 132 and 134 of bharatiya sakshya adhiniyam, 2023, protect lawyer-client communications from disclosure.

Kolkata HC stays Didi's relief to SSC staff sacked by SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kolkata-hc-stays-didis-relief-to-ssc-staff-sacked-by-sc/articleshow/121985111.cms,"Mamata Banerjee

KOLKATA: Calcutta HC Friday stayed till Sept 26 WB govt's interim relief for Group-C and Group-D employees of state-run schools who lost their jobs following a Supreme Court order on April 3.The state had announced monthly interim relief of Rs 25,000 for Group-C employees and Rs 20,000 for Group-D staff. Another section of candidates, who were waitlisted, moved HC for a stay on the scheme, arguing it ""frustrated"" the SC order.Justice Amrita Sinha held that the people whose jobs were terminated by the SC order could not be provided such support after the apex court had decided the issue of illegal appointments conclusively and opined that the appointments were a result of ""fraud"". Getting refund of money already disbursed to the beneficiaries would be a problem if the scheme was found to be in violation of law after the final hearing on a state review petition, she reasoned.HC also took note of the fact that the state welfare scheme was announced for a particular group who would not be doing any work. ""Paying persons gratuitously, who are not serving the state but are either sitting at home or are engaged elsewhere, does not appeal to the court,"" Justice Sinha held.HC stressed that the state had applied a ""pick and choose"" method for determining the beneficiaries of the welfare scheme. ""There are two sets of candidates. One set comprises appointed candidates whose jobs were terminated and the other waitlisted candidates. Both sets are jobless now,"" Justice Sinha said, holding that the scheme for a particular group ""intended to provide succour to the tainted terminated candidates"".Justice Sinha acknowledged the state's legislative competence to draft a welfare scheme but said it should apply equally. ""Whether it is proper for the state to create a class of favoured candidates out of a bigger class of unemployed candidates is a matter to be decided after hearing (all) parties.""",Calcutta hc friday stayed till sept 26 wb govt's interim relief for group-c and group-d employees of state-run schools who lost their jobs following a supreme court order on april 3.

NEW DELHI: India has been holding yoga events every year on June 21 since 2014, when UN adopted India's resolution to mark the day as International Day of Yoga (IDY).Celebrating IDY was first proposed by PM Narendra Modi at the United Nations General Assembly in 2014. Highlighting yoga's universal appeal, he suggested the Summer Solstice - June 21 - as the appropriate day for the purpose. With 177 UN member states co-sponsoring the resolution, the proposal received overwhelming support, with IDY being first celebrated in 2015.A survey commissioned by Ministry of Ayush has found that this exercise has led to nearly one in every four persons in India incorporating yoga - which includes asana sequences, breath control exercises and meditation - into their lifestyle.While 11% of the respondents - 30,084 people from across the country - said they practise yoga daily, 13% said they do it sometimes.However, 75% of people still don't practise yoga. To encourage such people, the survey report suggests complementing high-visibility flagship events such as IDY with grassroots mobilisation, digital platforms, and institutional partnerships. One of the moves by govt in this direction is a plan to upgrade existing parks in various panchayats (rural) and municipalities (urban) into Yoga parks where people can practise yoga every day.The Ayush ministry report also calls for embedding yoga instruction within school and university wellness programmes to foster early habit formation among young adults (18-24 years).The middle-aged groups can benefit from flexible work arrangements and digital access, which offer opportunities to scale virtual and office-based yoga interventions and convert occasional participants into consistent practitioners, the researchers suggest. They highlighted that nearly 17% of the elderly - the highest of any age group - practise yoga regularly.""The elderly people recognise the benefits of yoga, but they face barriers in including the practice in their daily lives. To address this, senior citizens-focused modules-such as chair-based asanas, balance exercises, and guided breathwork- should be delivered through community health centres and assisted-living facilities, ensuring that older adults can safely and confidently integrate yoga into their daily routines,"" said Raghvendra Rao, director of Central Council for Research in Yoga and Naturopathy (CCRYN).He also stressed the need for more yoga trainers and accessibility to yoga classes, offline or through digital mode. Subhash Giri, professor of medicine at Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital, stressed that yoga provides numerous physical, mental, emotional, and long-term health benefits.Saima Wazed, regional director of WHO Southeast Asia said: ""The benefits of yoga are well-documented. Studies have shown that 77% of people report feeling physically stronger after practising yoga regularly; 82% of patients with chronic inflammation experienced a nearly 50% reduction in symptoms after just six weeks of daily yoga. A study by Harvard Medical School found 60% of participants with depression experienced a significant reduction in symptoms after practising yoga twice a week for eight weeks"".","India has been holding yoga events every year on june 21 since 2014.

“What is not granted by fate cannot be gained by effort,





What is given by fate will not leave, even if discarded”

In 1998, Thai actor-singer Ruangsak Loychusak boarded Thai Airways flight TG261. Midair, the aircraft suddenly plunged. Out of 146 passengers, 101 perished. Ruangsak survived. Decades later, Vishwas Kumar Ramesh was left the sole survivor of the tragic Air India flight AI-171, which had 242 people onboard. An eerie detail stood out: both were seated inA mere coincidence , perhaps.Take the case of Tsutomu Yamaguchi. On August 6, 1945, he was in Hiroshima for a work trip. He witnessed the first atomic bomb drop but lived to tell the tale. Reeling from the horror, he returned to his hometown, Nagasaki—only to survive a second atomic bombing three days later. He lived till the age of 93.On the other hand, there are also stories of those who were not supposed to be in these situations, but were still present, as if to embrace death.In the folktale ‘Appointment in Samarra’, a merchant in Baghdad sends his servant to the market who returns terrified. The servant claims he saw the lady of death who looked at him strangely. He borrows a horse from his master saying he will escape to Samarra, another city. The same evening, the merchant meets the lady of death. She reveals that she was surprised to see his servant in Baghdad because she had an appointment with him that night in Samarra.The parallels in the assassinations of Lincoln and Kennedy feel almost fabricated—except they are not. Both were elected to Congress in years exactly a century apart (1846, 1946). Both became presidents, in 1860 and 1960. Both were succeeded by men named Johnson—Andrew and Lyndon—also born 100 years apart. Their assassins, too, were born a century apart. And both were shot in the head on a Friday, with their wives present. Lincoln had a secretary named Kennedy; Kennedy had one named Evelyn Lincoln. Even their assassins were silenced before trial. How does one explain this? Are we in the realm of probability or prophecy? Were they enacting the same scene, unknowingly?The world is not short of such ironies—coincidences that nudge the line between chance and destiny.Sceptics argue that the mind is an expert at finding patterns. We remember the hits and forget the misses.I once heard a tale that haunted me. Ten strangers, caught in a storm, took refuge in an inn. One among them, an astrologer, sensed ominous forces and predicted that lightning would strike soon. The group decided that each person would walk to a nearby tree and return. Nine went, but nothing happened. As the tenth stepped out and touched the tree, lightning struck. Not the tree—but the inn. He stood alone in the rain, the only survivor.Was that fate—or chance?Winston Churchill once raised a toast and said, “I wish you all luck. Not health or wealth. Because most people on the Titanic were healthy and rich—but very few were lucky.”There was a time when I dismissed such statements, confident in science and its promise of order. I believed the universe had no room for unseen hands. But now, I pause, I no longerWhat we know about the hidden hands that sculpt our destinies, is as small as a grain of sand pinched between two fingers. The unknown stretches beyond imagination—vast, silent, and as infinite as the universe itself. In that stretch lies the answer to the question why the passenger in seat 11A alone was spared.The wisdom of Valluvar declares that there are things beyond our efforts. He exclaims how fate could outpace even the most guarded plans of human beings.","Thirukkural with the times explores real-world lessons from the classic tamil text.
