NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha on Thursday ordered the termination of two J&K government teachers found by an internal enquiry to be part of Lashker e Taiba's (LeT) overground network in Jammu division's Reasi and Rajouri districts respectively.The two staffers -- Ghulam Hussain, who joined the J&K education department in 2004 and Majid Iqbal Dar, working there since 2009 -- were dismissed by invoking Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India as part of the ongoing, broader crackdown on the terror ecosystem within the Union territory. Nearly 77 J&K govt staffers have been given marching orders under this provision since 2020.Both Hussain and Dar are currently lodged in prison in separate terror cases.Sources in J&K govt told TOI that Hussain was posted at Govt Primary School, Kalwa, Mahore, Reasi but covertly working for LeT to strengthen its terror network in Reasi and the surrounding areas.“The evidence collected by the law enforcement and intelligence agencies has revealed that he was in touch with LeT terrorists Mohd Qasim and Ghulam Mustafa through encrypted messaging applications and was carrying out terror activities at their behest.He would receive terror funds via local conduits and pass them on to families of known terrorists for support, besides using the money for terror recruitment and logistics.Ghulam was arrested in 2023. Sources, citing investigation details, said he was a highly-radicalised terror sympathiser and involved in recruitment of youth into the terror fold.Majid Iqbal Dar was appointed as a laboratory assistant in 2009 promoted as a teacher in 2019. As per the dossier on his terror links, Dar was working for LeT as an OGW and was involved in radicalising youngsters in Rajouri and surrounding areas. Investigation revealed that Dar was engaged in narco-terror activities and maintained a close link with LeT terrorist Mod Jabar. He was a reliable asset to LeT and was using drug money to finance terror activities and radicalise gullible youth, said a source.“Dar’s terror link was exposed in January 2023 when police recovered an IED planted near J&K Bank in Rajouri. During the course of investigation, the police arrested three persons including Dar. It was later revealed that Majid, along with LeT terrorists Jabar and Zohaib Shazad, had planted the IED on the instruction of an LeT handler based in Pakistan. They had received monetary compensation via a conduit,” said an officer.Sources said Dar continues to display radical tendencies inside the prison.","Ghulam hussain and majid iqbal dar were dismissed by invoking article 311(2)(c) of the constitution of india.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday criticised Congress MP Rahul Gandhi , alleging that Gandhi insulted the Chhath Puja festival as he is ignorant of India's culture since Italy is his ""maternal home"".Addressing multiple rallies in Bihar, Shah said the INDIA bloc will be ""wiped out"" and that voters would ""avenge"" what he called an ""insult to Chhathi Maiyya"". He also referred to an earlier incident where Congress workers in the state allegedly abused Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mother.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had held one of his election meetings in the Muzaffarpur on Wednesday, and alleged that the PM had tried to enact a ""drama"" by planning to take a dip in the Yamuna at Delhi, on the occasion of Chhath Puja.He had alleged that Modi gave up his plans to take a dip when it came to light that the spot he had chosen was a puddle created with clean, piped water, since the Yamuna was extremely polluted and not fit for a bath.""Rahul baba has said Modi and others who worshipped Chhathi Maiyya were indulging in drama. His maternal roots are in Italy, and hence he has no idea about the country's culture,"" Shah said, as quoted by PTI. He asked voters to press the EVM button on NDA symbols ""with such rage that the tremors are felt in Italy"".The home minister accused the Congress and its allies of preventing the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. He said, ""thwarting for 70 years"" the construction of the temple, which he said had been a matter of struggle ""since the times of the Mughals, and continued under the British"".Shah praised the Modi government for developing a new university at Nalanda, saying ""no Bakhtiyar Khilji will be able to destroy"" it. He also mentioned an ongoing project worth about Rs 850 crore to develop Punaura Dham in Sitamarhi district, which is linked to the birthplace of Goddess Sita. ""In two years from now, you will see PM Modi performing the consecration ceremony (pran pratishtha) at Punaura Dham,"" he said.At a rally in Nalanda, Shah opened his speech with references to Chanakya and Chandragupta Maurya. He then criticised the previous RJD governments led by Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi, saying Bihar witnessed ""over 32,000 kidnappings and 12 major massacres"" during their tenure. He said, ""Nitish Kumar ended the ‘jungle raj’... but RJD is trying to bring back ‘jungle raj’ in the state with a new face.""Shah rejected claims by Tejashwi Yadav that the NDA would take back money deposited in women’s accounts under welfare schemes. ""Nobody can dare to take that money back. RJD leaders must give up this diatribe,"" he said.The home minister said that during Nitish Kumar’s time in power, ""there has been a 20 per cent drop in murders while dacoities and kidnappings have gone down by 80 per cent"". He added, ""We are preparing the youth of Bihar to win medals in the 2036 Olympics that will happen in India.""","Amit shah said the india bloc will be ""wiped out"" and that voters would ""avenge"" what he called an ""insult to chhathi maiyya"" he asked voters to press the evm button on nda symbols ""with such rage that the tremors are felt in italy"" shah accused the congress and its allies of preventing the construction of the ram temple in ayodhya.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124980899,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-681244,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

'NDA Coming To Power With Thumping Majority': Bihar Minister Sanjay Saraogi On Assembly Polls

PATNA: NDA is all set to release its manifesto for the assembly elections on Friday, focusing on creating jobs within the state in sectors such as IT, semiconductors and micro, small and medium enterprises and setting up a contrast with opposition alliance, Mahagathbandhan's bid to draw voters with the lure of govt jobs.The BJP-led alliance's plan presents a contrasting vision and is seen to be ambitious in a state where there is a clamour for cushy govt jobs. In contrast, private jobs, although better paying are seen as riskier, often linked to business cycles and come with features like remuneration being linked to performance.Besides, in the past govts in Bihar have been seen to be more rigid to accommodating the demands of the private sector when it comes to concessions or providing land. The IT sector and MSMEs do not require large tracts of land.With migration being a major issue, NDA's push for creating employment within the state is also likely to address the concern.""There is talent here so why not focus on IT and similar sectors given that professionals from Bihar are working in Pune, Gurgaon and Bangalore,"" said a prominent NDA politician.The focus on MSMEs is seen to be a more pragmatic commitment given that Bihar is unlikely to be able to attract large factories to be set up without having the ecosystem that can cater to the big manufacturing companies.",Bihar polls: nda to release joint manifesto on october 31.

The story behind



NEW DELHI: A scary hostage situation unfolded in Mumbai's Powai on Thursday, as 50-year-old Rohit Arya held 17 children and two adults captive inside a studio, claiming he only wanted to ""have a conversation"" with certain people. Arya was shot when he allegedly tried to harm the children with an air gun and later died in hospital, officials said.Before the police entered the studio, Arya posted a video that circulated widely online in which he explained why he had taken the children and set out what he called his demands.In the viral clip, Arya introduced himself and explained his plan in calm, measured terms. He began by saying he had chosen hostage-taking over suicide and framed his action as a means to demand answers:""I am Rohit Arya. Instead of (committing) suicide, I made a plan and have taken a few children hostage....I have very simple demands. Very moral, ethical demands. I have some questions. I want to speak to some people and on their answers, if there are any counter-questions, I want to ask them. But I want these answers. I do not want anything else. I am not a terrorist, nor do I have any demand of money. Want to make simple conversations. ""He warned of consequences if provoked and insisted his motive was to force public answers: ""I want simple conversations, and that's why I've taken these children hostage.I've held them hostage as part of a plan. If I live, I'll do it. If I die, someone else will, but it will definitely happen. It will happen to these children if they don't suffer any harm.""He also threatened an extreme response to any ""wrong move"" : ""The slightest wrong move from your end will trigger me to set this whole place on fire and die in it. Whether I die or not, the children will be unnecessarily hurt and traumatised definitely.""Arya denied responsibility for any harm should it occur and framed himself as a person seeking talk-based solutions: ""If something happens to them, I shouldn't be held responsible for it. Those who are unnecessarily triggering me should be held responsible, cause a normal person just wants to talk.""""I am going to provide a solution just by talking. Please don't trigger me to do some harm to anybody,"" he added.According to Mumbai Police , Rohit Arya had called several children including boys and girls around 15 years old to R A Studio in Powai’s Mahavir Classic building for what he claimed was an audition for a web series. The auditions had reportedly been taking place for the past two days.The situation turned grim around 1:30 pm on Thursday, when Powai police received a distress call about a man holding several people hostage inside the studio. A massive response followed — teams from the Quick Response Team (QRT), the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad, and the fire brigade immediately rushed to the scene.""At about 1.30 pm, Powai police station received information that a person had taken 17 children hostage at Mahavir Classic building. The Mumbai Police team conducted a rescue operation and safely freed all the children. During the operation, while rescuing the children, the person got injured, was immediately rushed to the hospital and later declared dead,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police Datta Nalawade told PTI.Nalawade said the police initially tried to negotiate with Arya but were forced to act when talks failed. ""It was a challenging operation, because we were negotiating with him without any positive outcome. To save the children’s lives was our priority,"" he added.To reach the hostages, the police entered the studio through a bathroom window using a ladder provided by the fire brigade. In the operation, 17 children, a senior citizen, and another man were safely rescued.Officials said Arya was carrying an air gun and some chemicals. While police initially did not confirm that any firing took place during the rescue, Arya was declared dead at 5:15 pm at the hospital.Andheri MLA Murji Patel later visited the rescued children at Seven Hills Hospital. He said, ""I met the children at the hospital they were safe."" As per reports Arya had been shooting with the group for five days and had not appeared to threaten or intimidate them before Thursday’s incident.","Rohit arya, 50, held 17 children and two adults captive inside a studio in mumbai.

AGRA: Four men have been arrested in Aligarh for allegedly writing ""I love Muhammad"" on the walls of four temples to falsely implicate their Muslim neighbours over property dispute. Aligarh SSP Neeraj Jadon identified the four as Jishant Kumar, Akash Kumar, Dilip Kumar, and Abhishek Sarswat, all aged between 30 and 35.Police said the the fifth accused, identified as Rahul, is absconding.Police said the slogans were found scribbled on four shrines on Oct 25.

'Police's response was measured, safety of those held captive was priority'





MUMBAI: A 45-year-old documentary filmmaker from Pune held 17 children, aged 12-15, a 75-year-old woman and his staffer hostage for two hours at a recording studio in Powai Thursday afternoon after calling them for auditions for a web series. The crisis ended after a police commando team stormed the studio following failed negotiations and shot him in the chest purportedly in self-defence after he fired from an air gun. He was declared dead in hospital.The hostage drama played out after the captor, Rohit Aarrya, who had been living in a relative's flat in Chembur for the past few days, released a video saying he wanted ""simple answers"" to some questions and threatened to set the place ablaze if there was any move made to challenge him. In the clip, which was circulated to many media outlets, he said he was not a terrorist and only wanted ""to be heard"". ""Instead of dying by suicide, I have held some children hostage,"" he said.Police officials said they spent nearly two hours trying to negotiate with Aarrya and gauge his demands, but he refused to cooperate, even after one of the girls' parents said she suffered from seizures.An official said Rohit Aarrya appeared calm when police spoke to him, but at no stage did he elaborate on his motives.City police commissioner Deven Bharti maintained that Aarrya fired first, prompting retaliatory police firing. ""Regardless of his demands, we couldn't let him play with lives. He fired first at police. Our team fired back in self-defence. There was no other option."" Other officials reiterated that the safety of those held captive was the top priority, adding that the police team's response was measured and as per the protocol.The death prompted calls by legal experts for a magisterial inquiry, as laid down by law, to verify the claim of retaliatory police firing.While Aarrya did not elaborate on his motive in the video or during police's attempts at negotiations, it emerged that Aarrya had sat on a hunger strike against former school education minister Deepak Kesarkar of Shiv Sena in 2024 over alleged dues of Rs 2 crore for a state-sanctioned school cleanliness project. Kesarkar said he personally gave him some money as a ""gesture of sympathy"" even though the school education department maintained that Aarrya had collected payment directly from some children. He said Aarrya should have taken up the issue with the department instead of holding children hostage.The city crime branch took over the probe. Those rescued were taken to SevenHills Hospital for medical examination.","Rohit aarrya, 45, held 17 children, aged 12-15, a 75-year-old woman and his staffer hostage for two hours at a recording studio in powai.

PRAYAGRAJ/MEERUT: Allahabad high court has acquitted four men, including two Pak nationals, convicted as terrorists and sentenced to death for killing eight CRPF personnel and wounding five in a 2007 attack on their camp in UP's Rampur. The bench instead held the four guilty under the Arms Act.The family of one of the slain CRPF constables reacted with anger. ""How can terrorists who killed so many security personnel with automatic weapons be acquitted? It's unbelievable. I lost my father, and now the killers walk free. Is this justice?"" asked Deepa Chaudhary (26), daughter of CRPF constable Manveer Singh (35), who was among those killed in the 2007 attack.Allahabad HC bench noted in the verdict that the ""case would have met a different result had the investigation and prosecution been conducted by more trained police"".The court cited the prosecution's ""failure to prove beyond reasonable doubt"" their culpability in the crime. Justices Siddhartha Varma and Ram Manohar Narayan Mishra acknowledged the ""magnitude"" of the terrorist attack on the CRPF camp on the night of Dec 31, 2007, but said they were ""constrained"" by prosecutorial failure to overturn the death sentence pronounced by a trial court in 2019 against Mohd Sharif, Sabauddin, Imran Shahjad and Md Farooq under sections 302 and 149 of IPC.The bench instead held the four guilty under Section 25 (1-A) of the Arms Act, based on the seizure of AK-47 rifles from them, and sentenced them to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs 1 lakh each. A fifth convict serving a life sentence in the case - Jang Bahadur Khan, alias Baba - was acquitted of terrorism charges and convicted for illegal possession of weapons.""The period of imprisonment undergone by the appellants will be adjusted towards the above sentence awarded to them,"" states the order. While observing that it could not deny that the CRPF camp was attacked, ""the defect in investigation ultimately culminated in the acquittal of the accused persons"".""Proving the principal offence beyond reasonable doubt is a golden rule that runs through the web of criminal jurisprudence. The state would be at liberty to deal appropriately with the lapses in investigation and proceed against the guilty police officers under law,"" says the order.Deepa's mother, Pinki Devi, said, ""The investigators were so careless that they let such men go free. I lost my husband, and I still haven't come to terms with the loss. Now this verdict - it's despicable.""(With inputs from Shubham Yadav)","Court cites prosecution's failure to prove culpability in crime.

Chirag Paswan Accuses Owaisi of Dividing Muslims Through Fear Politics

Tejashwi avoids reaction to Owaisi

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has increased his attack on the opposition Mahagathbandhan, questioning why the alliance has not named any Muslim leader as its deputy chief minister face for the Bihar elections Addressing supporters, Owaisi said, ""Sitting next to Tejashwi Yadav, Mukesh Bhai of the VIP Party, confident in his community's history, declared that the Malla community is with Tejashwi. The Malla community represents 3% of Bihar's population. He declared that if they gain power, he will become the deputy CM... If a Malla's son will become the deputy chief minister, what will the 17% minority community in Bihar do? Are they only to spread 'Dari ' (carpet)?""He added, ""If a Malla's son can become the deputy chief minister, then Mohammad's son can also become the Prime Minister or chief minister. Nothing can stop us from achieving our goals. Remember, the more you dream, the more you trust in Allah's will, and the more you strive along the way, the more you will see the clearer the path will become.""On Tuesday, Owaisi had raised a similar question. He said, ""Why cannot a Muslim, who represents 17 per cent of the state's population, become the chief minister? After all, they seem to have no problem with promising the deputy CM's post to a person who represents only three per cent of the population.""He criticised Congress, RJD and Samajwadi Party, saying these parties seek Muslim votes without offering leadership roles. Owaisi said, ""Parties like Congress, RJD and Samajwadi Party seek votes of Muslims, cashing in on the minority community's fear of the BJP. These parties have not been able to stop the BJP but are still trying to get the votes of Muslims under the same pretext.""He also targeted the BJP. Owaisi said, ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi claims to take all along and strive to work for the progress of all. But his party fails to give tickets, in elections, to a single Muslim.""RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav declined to respond to Owaisi’s remarks. When asked, he said, ""Leave it. What can I say about it?"" Tejashwi is the Mahagathbandhan’s declared chief minister candidate.In the previous assembly elections, AIMIM contested 19 seats and won five, though four of its MLAs later moved to the RJD.In the 2020 Bihar Assembly elections, AIMIM contested 20 seats and won five, all from the Seemanchal belt. Seemanchal includes Araria, Katihar, Kishanganj and Purnia, located close to the West Bengal border. The Muslim population in Bihar is around 17.7%, and Muslims form about 40% of the population in at least 11 constituencies. They have a decisive influence on around 47 seats.The four districts of Kishanganj, Araria, Purnia and Katihar have 24 seats that will go to polls in the second phase. These districts have a high Muslim population. For many years, this region was seen as a strong area for the RJD and Congress. Owaisi first contested here in 2015 but did not win.Before the 2020 elections, AIMIM won a bypoll seat in Kishanganj. In 2020, the party won five seats — two each in Kishanganj and Purnia, and one in Araria. This changed the electoral maths in multiple seats, reducing the RJD-Congress vote share. The NDA finally defeated the Opposition by a slim margin, where a difference of only 12,000 votes separated the two sides in the final seat tally.The Mahagathbandhan released its manifesto on Tuesday, titled 'Bihar Ka Tejashwi Pran'. It promises that within 20 days of forming the government, a law will be passed to give one government job per family.The 2025 Bihar assembly elections will take place between the National Democratic Alliance (BJP, JD-U, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and Rashtriya Lok Morcha) and the Mahagathbandhan (RJD, Congress, CPI-ML, CPI, CPM and VIP).Polling will be held in two phases, on November 6 and 11. Counting of votes will take place on November 14.","Aimim chief asaduddin owaisi has increased his attack on the opposition mahagathbandhan.

'Already a subject of public ridicule': Red Chillies on Sameer Wankhede’s defamation suit over Bads of Bollywood; terms claim 'misconceived',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/already-a-subject-of-public-ridicule-red-chillies-on-sameer-wankhedes-defamation-suit-over-bads-of-bollywood-terms-claim-misconceived/articleshow/124954404.cms,"Sameer Wankhede Claims His Family Is Receiving Threats After Case Against Aryan Khan

NEW DELHI: Red Chillies Entertainment has told the Delhi high court that Indian Revenue Service officer and former NCB Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede's defamation suit against its Netflix series The Bads of Bollywood is ""misconceived,"" arguing that the show is ""a work of situational satire"" and that Wankhede’s reputation had already been under public ridicule long before its release.In its detailed reply, the Shah Rukh Khan-owned production house said the web series does not name or depict Wankhede, nor does it contain any defamatory material, adding that ""the plaintiff cannot claim reputational harm where none existed to begin with,"" news agency ANI reported.The affidavit stated that Wankhede's public image had already suffered following the 2023 CBI FIR against him for alleged extortion and corruption, undermining his claim of an ""unblemished record.""""The existence of the FIR and the necessity for interim protection belie the plaintiff’s assertions,"" the reply said, adding that he ""was already the subject of public ridicule and adverse commentary"" prior to the show’s release.Red Chillies maintained that The Bads of Bollywood is a satire on the Hindi film industry, exploring themes of celebrity culture, nepotism, and sensationalism through humor and exaggeration — forms of expression protected under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.Challenging the maintainability of the case, the company also argued that the Delhi high court lacks jurisdiction, since both Wankhede and the principal defendants, including Netflix, are based in Mumbai.Referring to a brief, one-minute-forty-eight-second scene that Wankhede objected to, Red Chillies said it “merely portrays an overzealous officer” and carries no defamatory reference.Quoting the Bonnard v. Perryman principle, the reply urged the court to avoid pre-trial injunctions in defamation cases as they amount to prior restraint on free speech.“Satire allows the satirist to criticise in the harshest terms and is not intended to harm reputation. Whether the comment is malicious or artistic can only be determined at trial,” it said.The company further argued that as a public servant, Wankhede “must not be too thin-skinned” and should withstand fair comment and parody. His petition, it said, was an “attempt to stifle legitimate artistic expression.”The Delhi high court has listed the matter for hearing on November 10, after directing all parties to file written submissions.(With ANI inputs)","Sameer wankhede has filed a defamation suit against red chillies entertainment.

EKTA NAGAR, NARMADA: Attacking the Congress for “leaving no stone unturned to erase Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s legacy” and overlooking his contribution in uniting the country after Independence, home minister Amit Shah on Thursday said the Narendra Modi govt accorded him due recognition by erecting his 182-ft ‘ Statue of Unity ’ at Kevadia, now called Ekta Nagar, and organising an annual parade of all state and Central police forces at the site on his birth anniversary.This year being the 150th birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas parade will get grander. Presided over by the prime minister, it has been upgraded to the scale of the Republic Day parade. It will feature march-past by various state police and Central paramilitary contingents, each led by woman officers, as well as salute by Shaurya Chakra awardees of CRPF and 16 BSF personnel awarded police medals for their valour during Operation Sindoor. Also on display will be heroic stunts by BSF’s Indian breed dogs, daredevilry by motorcycle-borne personnel of the Assam police and BSF’s camel show. Just like the Republic Day parade, tableaux of different state police and paramilitary forces will be part of the parade. Cultural performances, including a grand closing show of dances from various parts of the country featuring 900 artistes, will enthrall the audience as they watch the spectacle with Sardar Patel’s towering statue as the perfect backdrop.A flypast by IAF’s Suryakiran team will match from the sky, the show of colour and talent on the ground.Shah, while addressing a conference on the event in Patna, said the grand parade will not be a one-off event and shall be organised every year on October 31, “similar to the Republic Day parade on January 26”. He said that this parade will serve as a strong medium to inspire the youth of the nation and educate them about Sardar Patel’s principles and his immense contributions to the country.The 150th year tribute to the ‘Iron Man of India” shall continue well beyond Friday. A ‘Bharat Parv’ is being organised here in Ekta Nagar from Nov 1 and shall conclude on the birth anniversary of tribal icon Bhagwan Birsa Munda. “This program will showcase a wonderful synthesis of the cultural diversity, food, costumes, crafts, folk art and music of tribes from across the country,” shared Shah.Hailing the role of Sardar Patel in uniting the country’s 562 princely states into one nation as Independent India’s first home minister, Shah said it is unfortunate that after his demise, the opposition left no stone unturned to erase his legacy. “He was awarded the Bharat Ratna after a delay of 41 years and no monument was built in his honour. It was only when Shri Narendra Modi became the chief minister of Gujarat that he conceptualised the Statue of Unity,” he said adding that Ekta Nagar is now an attractive tourist destination with 14 added attractions like the Valley of Flowers, Ekta Nagar Township, Lake Circuit, Light and Sound Show, Patel Garden, Ekta Cruise, Butterfly Garden, Jungle Safari, Ekta Mall and the Glow Torch Viewpoint.","This year being the 150th birth anniversary of sardar patel, the rashtriya ekta diwas parade will get grander.

PATNA: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday that fulfilling the dreams of Bihar's youth was the ""sankalp"" (resolve) of both ""Narendra and Nitish"", even as he attacked Congress MP Rahul Gandhi for allegedly insulting Chhathi Maiya (goddess).Addressing twin election rallies in Muzaffarpur and Chhapra, Modi wove together the promise of youth empowerment with sharp criticism of the opposition, accusing them of misleading voters and disrespecting Bihar's culture and faith.In Muzaffarpur, Modi questioned, ""Will Bihar and Hindustan forgive those who insulted even Chhathi Maiya for votes?"" He was referring to Rahul's recent remark that Modi could even dance on stage for votes and had done ""drama"" in the name of Chhath. ""While your son Modi is trying to get Chhath registered on the Unesco heritage list, Congress-RJD people are insulting Chhathi Maiya for votes. Will Bihar, Hindustan and the mothers and sisters who fast without water during Chhath tolerate such insults and not punish them,"" Modi asked. He added that such comments would not be forgiven ""for hundreds of years to come"".In Chhapra, the PM struck the developmental chord. ""Your dream is my resolution.Narendra and Nitish will realise it. It's time to undertake Bihar's journey from good governance to prosperity. It's your duty to maintain its continuity,"" he said.The PM assured that youth would soon find jobs within the state after the NDA returned to govt, promising to stop migration by creating local employment opportunities. However, he warned young voters against ""false promises"" made by the opposition. ""Their manifesto is nothing but their rate list for what they intend to get in return,"" he said.Targeting RJD and Congress, Modi said their leaders avoided visiting Ayodhya because of ""appeasement and vote-bank politics"". He added that the NDA was committed to blending development with heritage, as seen in projects like the Hariharnath corridor being developed on the lines of Kashi, which he said had boosted tourism and the livelihoods of small vendors. ""Our govt is connecting the treasures of Bihar with employment,"" he said.Modi said while NDA stood for ""padhai, kamai, davai and sichai"", the RJD-Congress symbolised ""katta, krurta, katuta, kushasan and corruption"". ""Law and governance suffer where there is katta and krurta, and social justice is not possible amid corruption,"" he said.
