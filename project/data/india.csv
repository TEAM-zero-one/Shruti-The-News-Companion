"Bhagwat: 'For balance in society', families should ideally have 3 kids",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bhagwat-for-balance-in-society-families-should-ideally-have-3-kids/articleshow/123572502.cms,".

New Delhi: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat Thursday said families should ideally have three children, calling it necessary for balance in society and future stability. Speaking on the final day of the '100 Years Journey of RSS: New Horizons' series, Bhagwat said demographic changes always have serious social and political effects, emphasising that both extraordinary rise and dips in birth rates can have problems. ""All scriptures say that societies with very few children gradually disappear. So, this balance must be maintained. Having three children is the right thing. Not less than three, not much more either,"" the RSS chief said.He also quoted doctors to say that three children, their births rightly spaced, are good for families as well as for their younger members as growing up with siblings helps in tempering egos.""To keep a civilisation alive, India's population policy suggests 2.1 (average number of children), which basically means three children. But resources have to be managed too, so we must restrict it to three,"" he said during a question-answer session on the last day of the RSS centenary lecture series.He said while Sangh is not leading an Ayodhya-kind movement for the ""reclamation"" of sites like Varanasi's Gyanvapi mosque and Mathura's Shahi Idgah, its members were free to join agitation for restoring the places to Hindus.Stressing India's Muslims are citizens who deserve livelihood and respect, Bhagwat added that people must value their mother tongues while also using English as a language of communication.Responding to a question, Bhagwat asserted that religion is by individual choice and there should be no allurement or force in this matter. ""Religion is an individual's own choice. No one should be forcefully converted. We have to stop it. The second issue is infiltration. Every country has their own rules and regulations, limited resources. So, infiltration should be stopped and the govt is making efforts to stop this. .. We should give jobs to our own people, including Muslims,"" he said.On the issue of changing names of roads and towns bearing Muslim names, he said his insistence was that roads or towns should not be named after invaders.","Mohan bhagwat said demographic changes always have serious social and political effects. He emphasised that both extraordinary rise and dips in birth rates can have problems. ""having three children is the right thing.

NOIDA: A week after 26-year-old Nikki Bhati succumbed to severe burn injuries, member of the Uttar Pradesh State Women's Commission Minakshi Bharala visited her village in Greater Noida's Roopwas and spoke to her sister Kanchan and their mother.Bharala said Kanchan stood by the allegation that it was Nikki's husband Vipin who had set her on fire over dowry demands on Aug 21.Read also: In her last moments, Nikki Bhati told doctors she suffered burns in cylinder blast Kanchan's stance is pivotal to the ongoing investigation, as the family seeks justice for Nikki.""Kanchan has narrated everything that happened that evening and stands firm on her statement that it was Vipin who poured inflammable liquid on Nikki and set her ablaze. The family only seeks justice, so no woman faces the same fate,"" Bharala said. ""We have spoken to the police commissioner, who said the investigation will be completed in a few days, after which the charge sheet will be filed.""Kanchan, who is married to Vipin's brother Rohit, lodged the FIR against both brothers and their parents, alleging years of dowry harassment and violence. She claimed Nikki was tortured repeatedly, assaulted a day before her death, and then attacked again around 5.45pm on Aug 21.""Kanchan told me that evening, Nikki had made lemonade for me because I was unwell, then went upstairs to iron clothes.

""She is traumatised but insistent on her statement.""While Vipin, his parents and his brother Rohit have been arrested and charged with murder, police are likely to reexamine Kanchan after CCTV footage emerged showing Vipin standing at a grocery shop near the house around the same time.A separate video clip, allegedly filmed by Kanchan, captures a woman's voice asking Nikki, ""What have you done? (Yeh kya kar liya?)"" In her earlier statement, Kanchan told police that the video where Vipin was seen assaulting and pulling Nikki by the hair was recorded on Feb 11.Cops have also recorded the statement of the doctor who attended Nikki at Fortis on Tuesday night. ""The doctor said it was Nikki who told them she was burnt after a gas cylinder blast, which was also recorded in the hospital's memo,"" the officer said.For now, police said, they were joining the dots and collecting evidence. ""Kanchan is unwell now, but her statement will be recorded again,"" a senior police officer part of the investigation said.Bharala said she asked the family why both sisters continued to live with their in-laws despite alleged torture.""They told me they feared what society would say if they left. Even a day before Nikki's death, both sisters were assaulted, yet they did not approach the police,"" she said.On allegations that Nikki and Vipin quarrelled over her career and social media activity, Bharala said she reviewed Nikki's online posts and found nothing objectionable. She also addressed claims of Vipin's extramarital affairs. ""If they knew their husbands were behaving this way, they should have returned home. But social stigma stopped them.""On the video showing Vipin outside the house around the time of the incident, Bharala said Kanchan explained there were three entry points from the shop into the house.

At least 20 others were injured in that landslide. Doda reported four deaths.Lt Governor Manoj Sinha announced ex gratia of Rs 9 lakh each to the families of the landslide victims.

'Land of Bihar should not tolerate'



Shameful beyond words



NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party on Thursday attacked the Congress after a video of some men allegedly hurling abuses at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his mother from the venue of Rahul Gandhi 's rally in Bihar went viral.The video, shared on social media by several accounts, showed unidentified individuals using Hindi slurs against PM Modi from a dais of Rahul Gandhi's rally. The Congress leader is holding 'Voter Adhikar Yatra' in Bihar along with RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Union home minister Amit Shah condemned the Congress' purported video and said that under Rahul Gandhi, the oldest party's politics has reached its lowest level.He further said that this ""abusive"" rally shows that the Congress party has returned to its old ways and character, through which it has always poisoned the country's political culture.""The use of abusive language filled with expletives against the Honorable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi Ji and his late mother from the Congress and RJD platform in Darbhanga, Bihar, is not only condemnable but also a stain on our democracy. Under Rahul Gandhi's leadership, Congress politics has reached its lowest level. They cannot tolerate how a poor mother's son has been sitting in the Prime Minister's chair for the past 11 years and is continuously taking the country forward under his leadership,"" Amit Shah said in a post on X.He further said, ""From the time of being the Chief Minister of Gujarat until today, the Gandhi family has left no stone unturned in spreading hatred against Modi Ji. However, now they have crossed all limits of propriety. This is an insult to every mother, every son, for which 140 crore countrymen will never forgive them.""Union health and family welfare minister JP Nadda also slammed and said that the so-called Vote Rights Journey of the Congress, in which the late mother of PM Modi was ""abused"" from the Congress-RJD platform, is highly condemnable and reprehensible.He also said that this is disregard for Bihar's culture on the soil of Bihar by two ""princes""(Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi Yadav) who have crossed all limits of indecency.He demanded Gandhi and Yadav should immediately apologise for this ""heinous act.""BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said that the Congress party, which once associated itself with Mahatma Gandhi, has now turned into an abusive party.""The rally currently taking place in Bihar and the language being used there are deeply disturbing. It is unfortunate that we even have to discuss such behaviour in a press conference. In a democracy, there are certain boundaries, and today those boundaries have been crossed. Prime Minister Modi has been targeted with abusive language, which is a matter of great shame for the party responsible,"" Patra said.""The same party that once associated itself with the freedom struggle and Mahatma Gandhi has now turned into an abusive party. It no longer upholds Gandhi ji’s ideals; instead, it has become a party belonging to the Gandhi family. Their arrogance is evident. They are driven only by political agendas, and when those agendas fail, they resort to abuse,"" he added.After the video goes viral, former Indian Youth Congress National Secratary, Mohd Naushad apologised for the remarks and said that the party would never stoop to such cheap and disgraceful behavior.He also said that he condemned such remarks made against the Prime Minister but suggested that it is possible that this was done by opposition or people with ""vested interests.""He said, ""Yesterday I had a program in Bitholi as part of Rahul Gandhi’s Voter Rights Yatra... We have been party workers for 20 years and we would never stoop to such cheap and disgraceful behavior. He is our country’s Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of the entire nation. I have inquired about this and as soon as Rahul Gandhi arrived, we followed him with the crowd towards the Muzaffarpur rally. Whoever made such abusive remarks or engaged in this behavior, I strongly condemn it and I apologize for it. I seek forgiveness. It is also possible that this was done by someone from the opposition or by people with vested interests, as there are always people wanting tickets...""Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath condemned the Congress' alleged remarks and said that this is an ""insult"" to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.He also said that Bihar will respond to this ""hateful"" politics in a democratic manner and protect Indian culture and democratic values.""The use of indecent language against the honorable Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji from the platform of Congress and RJD is highly condemnable and a fall from political decorum. This act by the leaders of the INDI alliance is not just an insult to the Prime Minister ji, but an affront to the sentiments of 140 crore Indian citizens. Remember, an ordinary mother, through her struggles and values, shaped such a son who dedicated himself to the service of the nation and today resides in the hearts of people as the world's most popular leader. The people of Bihar will certainly respond to this hateful politics in a democratic manner and protect Indian culture and democratic values,"" Adityanath said in a post on X.Earlier, BJP, refrained from posting the video of the incident on its official X handle, but said that the Congress had surpassed all ""limits of insult, hatred, and vulgarity""The BJP stated, ""Tejashwi (Yadav) and Rahul are behind the use of such filthy language that it cannot be repeated from a public platform... Such lowliness was never seen before in politics. This Yatra has crossed all limits of insult, hate and tastelessness.""They added, ""They have used a very vulgar language against the prime minister's late mother.""Union minister Chirag Paswan also slammed the alleged use of abusive language against PM Modi on Thursday and said that they have spoken like local goons, and this is a tradition of the RJD, which has defamed the Bihar since the 1990s, and till now the state is fighting for the lost legacy and respect.Chirag Paswan said, ""... In politics, there are bound to be differences. In a diverse democracy like India, everyone has their opinion and vote, and because of differences, one cannot lower the dignity of languages... Indian languages have such a good collection of words and one can make the sharpest of attacks by using dignified words. Nobody can accept using abusive words against the Prime Minister of the country. ..""""If you have some issues with the work of the Prime Minister and government policies, you can do that. But you cannot use abusive language against the Prime Minister's family who are far from public life... They have spoken like local goons, and this is a tradition of the RJD, which has defamed our Bihar since the 1990s, and till now we are fighting for our lost legacy and respect... Are these your party workers or are they your goons who are verbally abusing the Prime Minister's mother?. .."" he added.Another Union Minister, Rajiv Ranjan (Lalan) Singh, said that Rahul Gandhi must have realised in Bihar that he will not be able to win the elections, that is why the Raebareli MP is frustrated and disappointed.""The land of Bihar does not tolerate such behaviour. We strongly condemn this and tell Rahul Gandhi to sit at home now, he is not fit to be the Leader of Opposition... They (Congress and RJD) are doing the drama of Yatra to include illegal immigrants in the voter list..."" Lalan Singh said.National Vice President of BJP Baijayant Jay Panda slammed the alleged slurs used against PM Modi and said this is the ""moral bankruptcy.""""From an INDI alliance stage in Bihar, a vile slur was hurled at Hon’ble Prime Minister @narendramodi’s late mother. This is not politics, it is moral bankruptcy. Rahul Gandhi & Tejashwi Yadav first insulted Bihar by bringing leaders who demeaned its people.

"Shah: Evict squatters within 30km of borders, stop demographic change",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shah-evict-squatters-within-30km-of-borders-stop-demographic-change/articleshow/123534076.cms,"File photo

New Delhi: Recalling PM Narendra Modi's 2025 I-Day speech that flagged demographic changes in border villages caused by illegal immigration ""as part of a deliberate design"", home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday urged the collectors of districts covered under the Vibrant Village Programme (VVP), chief secretaries of border states and central armed police forces (CAPFs) to pay attention to the problem and address it suitably.Addressing the inaugural session of the two-day VVP workshop being organised by Union home ministry here, Shah urged the collectors/district magistrates of border districts to take appropriate action to remove illegal encroachments within a 30-km radius of the border, including religious structures that often come up as ""part of a deliberate design"" to alter demography of surrounding areas. He cited the example of Gujarat, saying it had cleared numerous encroachments along both maritime and land borders.""Demographic changes in border areas directly impact security of the country and its borders. It should not be assumed that this is happening due to geographical conditions; rather, it is occurring as part of a deliberate design,"" Shah told the conference attended by junior home minister Bandi Sanjay Kumar, senior MHA officials, the Intelligence Bureau director, chief secretary of border states covered under VVP, DG of border forces and collectors of border districts.The minister exhorted DMs of VVP districts to address the illegal immigration and encroachment issue ""with seriousness and attention to detail"". The same suggestion was made to state chief secretaries and CAPF chiefs.Stating that VVP had led to infrastructure development in target villages, preservation and enhancement of culture, and employment generation through tourism, making village life vibrant, Shah said it was the responsibility of chief secretaries, district authorities and CAPFs to consider what additional steps can be taken, beyond VVP, to transform border villages into significant tools of security.He said it was the responsibility of CAPFs and district collectors to establish dairy cooperatives to meet the milk requirements of CAPFs and the Army directly from the villages, thus aiding in employment generation.Commending the population rise in Arunachal's border villages since VVP's launch, Shah said locals would not seek to migrate if they got facilities and employment opportunities in their own village. He said if initiatives like homestays were extended to border villages and state tourism departments made proper arrangements for bookings, every household would have employment.Shah said to achieve 100% saturation of govt schemes, district collectors should consider coordinating with CAPFs.

SSC Recruitment Scam: Massive Protest In Kolkata, Police Detains Protesting Teachers Amid Scuffles

Poll What is your opinion on the switch from TCS to Eduquity as the exam conducting agency? A positive change A negative change

NEW DELHI: Amid protests over glitches and irregularities in the conduct of computer-based govt recruitment examinations by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), SSC chairman S Gopalakrishnan on Monday assured that the “technical and operational matters” faced by a few candidates in the first selection post examination on July 24, have been “stabilised” and no major disruptions anticipated in the upcoming exams.Gopalakrishnan said around 5.5 lakh candidates had appeared in the first exam, the first to be held after M/s Eduquity replaced M/s TCS as the exam conducting agency (ECA) in July 2025, with questions being set by other content agencies and delivered digitally from a vault. Some candidates at two of the total 194 centres faced issues due to bugs, like duplication of questions, repeat of same options, etc.“A detailed analysis by CDAC identified about 59,000 candidates affected by system disruptions. They will now retake the exam in three shifts on August 29, 2025,” he said adding that the stenographer exams conducted from Aug 6-8 had witnessed no disruptions. SSC has also rescheduled the Combined Graduate Level (CGL) Exam from August 13 to mid-September.On Congress alleging “rigging” of government recruitment exams under the Modi government and slamming the “brutal lathicharge” on those protesting against it, SSC alleged that the protests, led by coaching institutes, were aimed at protecting business models rather than the genuine interests of candidates.Elaborating on the recent SSC examination reforms, Gopalakrishnan said aadhaar-based authentication at the application level and exam venue has helped prevent impersonation and repeated attempts by candidates to appear in multiple sessions or to take the role of scribes and exam functionaries. Also, deviation from old question patterns had denied the coaching institutes undue advantage. Rather than a single agency like TCS performing all tasks, SSC, has, from July onwards, entrusted different aspects of the examinations to four agencies.Eduquity is now the ECA, even as content agencies set the questions, CDAC handles IT security and detects hacking/malpractices and an independent agency monitors the exams. The idea is that no single agency can hijack or compromise the exams, and to maintain transparency and fairness, according to Gopalakrishnan.He further noted that the content providers, ECA and monitoring agencies are subject to deterrent penalties for any shortcomings in performance.The multiple agency system, it was highlighted, has resulted in certain entities (led by some online tutors or coaching institutes) attributing the initial system hiccups to ECA and demanding that TCS be brought back. Gopalakrishnan however explained that Eduquity was selected through a tender, with TCS listed only at third position in the bid.","Ssc chairman s gopalakrishnan assured that the “technical and operational matters” faced by a few candidates in the first selection post examination on july 24, have been “stabilised” no major disruptions anticipated in the upcoming exams.

Supreme Court raised the question - its refrain through the hearings on presidential reference over the court's decision to fix timelines for governors and the President to take calls on bills - again at the end of arguments from the Centre and NDA-led states canvassing wide discretionary powers for the state executive head.Leading the arguments on behalf of opposition-governed states that are diametrically opposite to those advanced by the Centre, senior advocate A M Singhvi, on behalf of Tamil Nadu, told the bench that a governor is merely an ornamental head of the state and bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers headed by the chief minister on every option to be exercised by him with regard to a bill.A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narsimha and A S Chandurkar said, ""The Constituent Assembly deleted the six-week timeline for a governor to take a decision on a bill and replaced it with 'as soon as possible'. Does it not mean at the earliest and not later than six weeks? As the framers of the Constitution expected a governor to act expeditiously, can SC not examine if a governor indefinitely sits over a bill passed by assembly to frustrate law-making?""This question came from the bench when solicitor general Tushar Mehta argued that a state govt is precluded from invoking Article 32 to seek a writ against a governor, who as per the Constitution is not answerable to a court for the decisions he takes while holding the constitutional post.Singhvi said a governor has no discretionary power to negate a bill passed by an assembly. Making a governor's decisions non-justiciable would make him, not the will of the people through an assembly, the supreme law-making authority as he can scotch a validly passed bill null and void by simply consigning it to his cupboard and forgetting about it, he said.The bench said if a governor finds a bill to be repugnant to central law, he had the option of reserving it for the President's consideration.",Can a governor keep a bill passed by the assembly pending indefinitely to frustrate the will of the people exercised through the legislature?

Teachers cross 1 cr mark even as school enrolment falls to 7-year low,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/teachers-cross-1-cr-mark-even-as-school-enrolment-falls-to-7-year-low/articleshow/123570200.cms,".

New Delhi: India has, for the first time, crossed the milestone of having more than one crore school teachers in a single academic year. This happened in 2024–25, even as the number of children enrolled in schools fell to its lowest in seven years.According to the Ministry of Education’s Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+), the total enrolment in schools stood at 24.68 crore in 2024–25, which is about 11 lakh less than the previous year. Officials said the fall in enrolment is mainly because of declining birth rates, though some states have shown a different trend. They added that the enrolment calculation is based on the 2011 Census population, which inflates the denominator in Gross Enrolment Ratio projections, and that the upcoming Census in 2026 will provide a clearer picture.Even though fewer children are coming into schools, the number of teachers has been rising steadily, improving the student-teacher balance. The UDISE+ data shows that at the foundational stage, the pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) is now 10, at the preparatory stage 13, at the middle stage 17, and at the secondary stage 21. These ratios are much better than the 1:30 benchmark suggested in the National Education Policy 2020.Teacher strength has gone up by 6.7% compared to 2022–23, a growth that officials said will ensure more individual attention to students, stronger teacher-student interaction and better classroom support.The overall enrolment has been shrinking over the last few years. In 2022–23, 25.18 crore students were enrolled, which dropped to 24.8 crore in 2023–24 and further to 24.68 crore in 2024–25. But alongside this fall, dropout rates have shown a sharp decline. At the preparatory stage, dropouts have come down from 3.7% to 2.3%; at the middle level, from 5.2% to 3.5%; and at the secondary level, from 10.9% to 8.2%. Officials said this shows that children are staying in schools longer and schools are becoming more responsive to students’ needs.Retention levels have also gone up. At the foundational stage, retention improved from 98.0% to 98.9%; at the preparatory level from 85.4% to 92.4%; at the middle level from 78% to 82.8%; and at the secondary level from 45.6% to 47.2%. The report said one major reason for the improvement at the secondary level is the increase in the number of schools offering secondary education, which has made access easier and encouraged students to continue.UDISE+ also reported a significant decline in single-teacher and zero-enrolment schools. Officials said this has been possible because of targeted government interventions aimed at rationalising schools and teacher allocation. The number of single-teacher schools fell by about 6% compared to last year, while schools with zero enrolment declined by nearly 38%. The report said this reduction is a sign of better planning and will help create a more balanced education system.","India crossed the milestone of having more than one crore school teachers in a single academic year.

Deaths caused due to wrong side driving and lane indiscipline also increased, to 9,432 in 2023 from 9,094 in the previous year.The road transport ministry released the report “Road Accidents in India 2023” on Thursday, barely days before the Aug-end deadline set by the Supreme Court to make it public. As per the report, nearly 1.73 lakh lives were lost on Indian roads in 2023, which meant one death every three minutes. While road deaths increased by around 2.6% compared to 2022, the number of persons injured went up by 4.4% to a little over 4.6 lakh.Speeding remained the main cause of fatalities, accounting for 68% of all deaths, followed by wrong side driving and lane indiscipline (5.5%). In pothole deaths, Uttar Pradesh recorded over half of the fatalities, followed by Madhya Pradesh.The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) under the home ministry, which also brings out annual accident reports, has not yet published the report for 2023.As per the road ministry report, young adults in the age group of 18-45 years accounted for nearly two-thirds of fatalities in 2023.Two-wheeler riders accounted for around 45% of deaths (77,539), followed by pedestrians (35,221) and car/taxi occupants (21,496), on different categories of roads.The report also highlighted that non-use of helmets by two-wheeler riders claimed 54,568 lives, while non-use of seatbelts resulted in 16,025 car fatalities.Among the types of collision, tailgating, or hit from the back, accounted for a maximum 36,804 deaths (21%), followed by 31,209 fatalities due to hit and run (18%). Head-on collisions were the reason for 28,898 fatalities (nearly 17%).According to the report, national highways, which comprise barely 2% of the country's entire road network, witnessed 31.2% of all road crashes and 36.5% of fatalities. State highways accounted for 22% of accidents and 22.8% deaths.","Potholes claimed 2,161 lives in 2023, an increase of around 16.4% from the previous year.

Since glanders are zoonotic, preventing its spread in equines also protects human health.Though the guidelines, issued by the animal husbandry and dairying ministry, primarily apply to these yatras with immediate effect, states may extend them to other religious/tourism-related journeys involving equines.The guidelines provide a uniform framework for mandatory registration and tagging of all equines, health certification with compulsory testing for glanders and equine influenza, and a minimum acclimatisation of working equines engaged in carrying pilgrims and goods to high-altitude areas during the yatras.It also prohibits night movement and makes insurance coverage for all working equines mandatory. There is also a provision of defined load limits for equines (80–90 kg for horses/mules, 50 kg for ponies and 25 kg for donkeys).Under the revised action plan on glanders, the ministry makes testing of equines in endemic and high-risk areas mandatory, supported by improved laboratory diagnostics and regular field inspections.The plan strengthens surveillance, diagnostic capacity, response measures and stakeholder engagement, incorporating recent experiences and scientific inputs to make the programme more robust and effective.","The move is expected to ensure safety of pilgrims during pilgrimages.

If anyone advices me on running a shakha, then I am its expert. They are running state (government) for many years. So they are expert in state affairs. We know each others’ expertise,"" Bhagwat said.","Mohan bhagwat says there is no rift between the sangh and the bharatiya janata party (bjp) the rss chief said there could be ""difference of opinion"" while working towards the goals of the country.
