"Ruling on validity of Bihar SIR will apply in same rigour to pan-India exercise, says SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ruling-on-validity-of-bihar-sir-will-apply-in-same-rigour-to-pan-india-exercise-says-sc/articleshow/123911297.cms,"NEW DELHI: SC Monday said its ruling on petitions challenging the validity of the special intensive revision (SIR) of Bihar electoral rolls ahead of the assembly polls in the state would apply in same rigour to EC's decision for SIR across states from next year.As a litany of petitioners through their counsels competed to identify one or the other fault in the SIR process in Bihar, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi, which has passed many interim orders, including treating Aadhaar as the 12th document for filing applications for inclusion or exclusion of name in voter list, said, ""We will not pass piecemeal orders. We will hear the arguments on the validity of SIR in Bihar and give a final verdict. ""Bengal has already challenged the EC decision to conduct SIR in the state. When counsels for states, political parties and NGOs sought adjudication on a nationwide SIR, the bench said, ""Whatever we decide on petitions challenging Bihar-SIR, will be applicable to the EC decision to conduct nationwide SIR.""It posted the final hearing on petitions challenging Bihar SIR to Oct 7. Another applicant, advocate Ashwini Upadhyay, demanded a nationwide SIR, saying non-citizens and illegal migrants must not be allowed to become voters based on Aadhaar.He requested SC to modify its order directing Aadhaar to be the 12th document for filing application for inclusion or exclusion from the voter list. Upadhyay said Aadhaar is just a document for identification and cannot be proof of citizenship, a view already reiterated by the bench. SC had told EC to accept applications based on Aadhaar but empowered it to scrutinise these to determine whether the applicant seeking inclusion in voter list is an Indian citizen.For EC, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said that the commission would complete by Oct 1 the scrutiny of applications received by Sept 1, and finalise the voter list. ""Let EC be allowed to complete its work,"" he said.When advocates Prashant Bhushan and Vrinda Grover said the entire process for conducting SIR is illegal, SC said whenever allegations made by petitioners are put to EC, a different story emerges. ""If we find SIR to be illegal, then we have the power and jurisdiction to quash it,"" SC said.","Justices surya kant and joymalya bagchi said, ""we will not pass piecemeal orders"" the final hearing on petitions challenging bihar sir was posted to oct 7.

We will think of involving some IIT to provide us a solution so that every CCTV can be monitored at a particular place, and even the monitoring should not be human but by AI,"" SC said while reserving its order on the issue.The court was hearing a suo motu case in which it took cognisance of a media report on custodial deaths in police stations and decided to examine implementation of its earlier order on installing CCTV cameras in all police stations.

ITR filing FY 2024-25: Has deadline for Income Tax Returns filing been extended beyond September 15?

The Income Tax department on Sunday dismissed social media claims suggesting that the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) had been extended beyond September 15, clarifying that the due date remains unchanged.In a post on X, the department said: “A fake news is in circulation stating that the due of filing ITRs (originally due on 31.07.2025, and extended to 15.09.2025) has been further extended to 30.09.2025. The due date for filing ITRs remains 15.09.2025.”The clarification came amid a wave of unverified messages circulating online.The I-T department has urged taxpayers to rely only on updates from its verified handle @IncomeTaxIndia and avoid being misled by false claims. It further noted that its helpdesk is working “on a 24x7 basis” to support taxpayers with ITR filing, tax payment and other related services through calls, live chats, WebEx sessions and X.Over six crore ITRs had already been filed for the Assessment Year 2025-26 as of Saturday.The department thanked taxpayers and professionals for their efforts, while reminding those yet to file to do so before the September 15 deadline to avoid last-minute delays, penalties and interest.The filing window had originally closed on July 31 but was extended to September 15 due to revisions introduced in ITR forms earlier this year.These “structural and content revisions” were rolled out in April–May, requiring changes to filing utilities and back-end systems, which prompted the extension.While this relaxation covered individuals, HUFs and non-audit entities, officials have underlined that a further extension is “unlikely.”Taxpayers missing the deadline can still file a belated return until December 31, 2025, though this attracts late fees under Section 234F of the Income Tax Act — Rs 1,000 for income up to Rs 5 lakh and Rs 5,000 for income above that threshold.Delays also trigger interest liabilities under Sections 234A, 234B and 234C. Moreover, belated filers are shifted to the new tax regime by default and lose the ability to carry forward certain business or capital losses.ITR submissions have been steadily rising in recent years. For AY 2024-25, a record 7.28 crore returns were filed by July 31, 2024, up from 6.77 crore the previous year, marking a 7.5% annual increase.With Monday marking the final day, the department has reiterated its appeal: file early, comply on time, and avoid penalties.",The income tax department on sunday dismissed social media claims suggesting that the deadline for filing income tax returns had been extended beyond september 15.

Speaking to reporters, complainant’s counsel Ishan Dewan said, “The court has granted two days of judicial custody. The accused’s counsel opposed it, while we argued that police custody should have been sought. They have also filed for bail, which we will oppose by filing a reply.

The apex court put a hold on a clause that only those practising Islam for the last five years could create Waqf.

“The following part of clause (r) of Section 3 of the Amended Waqf Act ‘any person showing or demonstrating that he is professing Islam for at least five years’ shall stand stayed until the rules are framed by the State Government for providing a mechanism for determining the question as to whether a person has been practicing Islam for at least five years or not,” the bench said.

""Since no mechanism or procedure has been provided as of now for ascertaining as to whether a person has been practising Islam for at least five years or not, such a provision cannot be given effect to immediately,” it added.

It further stayed a provision which said a property should not be treated as “waqf property till the designated officer submits his report”.

In addition, another provision stating, in case the designated officer determines the property to be a government property, he should make necessary corrections in revenue records and submit a report to the state government, was also stayed.

What it directed the Central Waqf Council

The bench directed the Central Waqf Council not to have more than four non-Muslim members in the total composition of 20 besides asking state waqf boards to have not more than three such members in the total of 11.

Till the final determination about the title of a disputed property by the tribunal and subject to further orders of the high court in an appeal, the bench held, no third-party rights would be created.

What it did not stay

The bench did not stay Section 23 (appointment of chief executive officer and his term of office and other conditions of service) of the amended law.

It, however, directed the authorities “as far as possible"" an effort should be made to appoint the chief executive officer of the board who is the ex-officio secretary from the Muslim community.

The bench clarified its directions were prima facie and interim in nature, and would not prevent the petitioners or the government from advancing full arguments on the constitutional validity of the law during the final hearing.

of the law during the final hearing. On registration of waqf, it said if mutawallis (caretaker of waqf) have chosen not to get it registered for 30 long years, then they couldn't be heard to say the provision which now required the application to be accompanied by a copy of the waqf deed was arbitrary

The verdict underlined courts' acceptance of the legal position of presumption always being in favour of constitutionality of an enactment and the burden being on the person who ""attacks it"" to show a clear transgression of the constitutional principles.

The legislative intent was to prevent misuse of waqf provisions and safeguard public property, it said.

Referring to the precedents, the court said, ""Courts should be very slow in granting interim relief by way of staying the provisions of an enactment. Interim relief of such a nature can be granted in rare and exceptional cases.""

“Since the menace of mismanagement of the wakf properties was noticed by legislature, an enactment was found to be necessary as early as in the year 1923,” it added.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday stayed a few of the key provision of the recently passed Waqf (Amendment) Act, but held the constitutionality of the law.A bench of CJI BR Gavai and justice Augustine George Masih, in its 128-page interim order said, ""Presumption is always in favour of constitutionality of a statute and intervention (can be done) only in the rarest of rare cases. ""“We do not find that any case is made to stay the provisions of the entire statute. The prayer for stay of the impugned Act is, therefore, rejected,” it added.The orders comes after a flurry of PILs were submitted in the apex court challenging the amended law which was notified by the Centre on April 8 after receiving President Droupadi Murmu’s assent on April 5.The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025 itself had cleared the Lok Sabha on April 3 and the Rajya Sabha a day later, setting the stage for the current legal challenge.In order to ""protect the interest of parties"" and ""balancing the equities"", the top court stayed some of the provisions of the law.

My party made me go here and there a couple of times earlier, but this is not going to happen again. Who made me CM? It was the late Atal Bihari Vajpayee."" During that rally also, Nitish had blamed Lalan Singh for making him go astray and had spoken about RJD doing some mischief.So, why is Nitish reiterating his allegiance to NDA again and again?Also read: Who is Chirag Paswan targeting - opposition or Nitish Kumar? Nitish, who is the longest serving chief minister of Bihar, thanks to his political manoeuvres, has dumped the BJP twice in the past - first in 2014 ahead of the Lok Sabha elections then and again in 2022 when he accused the saffron party of trying to break his JD(U). During his second stint with the opposition parties, Nitish had played a key role in forming the INDIA bloc to challenge the BJP.Nitish, who had been the undisputed leader of NDA for almost two decades, saw his fortunes dip drastically in the 2020 assembly elections. For the first time, his party JD(U) was reduced to being the junior partner in the coalition as it won just43 seats while the BJP scored an impressive 74, one less than the RJD. Despite the huge gap in numbers, the BJP decided to continue with Nitish as the chief minister. Five years back, it was LJP chief Chirag Paswan, who had inflicted maximum damage to Nitish by walking out of NDA and strategically fielding candidates against JD(U) candidates. This time around Chirag is part of NDA in Bihar.Perhaps for the first time, Nitish is approaching elections with the odds stacked against him. There will be immense pressure on JD(U) during the seat-sharing talks if the yardstick is 2020 performance. Secondly, there have been several media reports around Nitish Kumar's health with the opposition leaders questioning his ability to lead the state.However, despite all these odds, Nitish continues to be an important factor in state politics. His popularity, especially amongst the women voters, is a huge advantage for any alliance that has him. Also, the caste survey in the state, which was carried out by Nitish when he was in government with the RJD, has shown that EBCs, a bloc that he claims to represent, are the largest chunk in the state politics.Clearly, the BJP can ill afford to lose Nitish ahead of elections even as it would want the JD(U) chief to recognise the saffron party's growth in Bihar. The BJP which has all along played second fiddle to Nitish in the state, would perhaps this time want to lead the government as the senior partner. Already, there are intense speculations on whether the BJP will formally declare him the chief minister face ahead of polls. Surrounded by all these uncertainties, Nitish Kumar would not want his detractors within the NDA to cite his ""Paltu Ram"" image to reduce his dominance in the alliance in the next assembly elections.(With inputs from agencies)","Bihar chief minister nitish kumar has been trying hard to dispel his ""paltu ram"" image.

He also vowed that he will never break alliance with BJP in the future.""Yes, there was some trouble in between… some people among them created problems, and this is never acceptable… sometimes even some of our own party people did such things.

Lallan was the national president of the JD(U), and stepped down just a month before Nitish abruptly exited the INDIA bloc.Speculation had been rife that Lallan was forced to resign amid perceptions that he had grown too close to the RJD, led by Nitish's long-time rival, Lalu Prasad Yadav Also read | 'Hellbent on insulting Bihar': PM Modi attacks Congress over 'bidi' post; vows to halt 'infiltration' The JD(U)-BJP alliance traces its roots back to the 1990s.

"SC refuses to stall waqf act, but stays some provisions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-refuses-to-stall-waqf-act-but-stays-some-provisions/articleshow/123908619.cms,"Abolishing waqf by user clause not arbitrary: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court, in an interim order Monday, refused to stay the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, prima facie finding none of its provisions illegal but suspended implementation of 'five-year practice of Islam' for dedicating a property to waqf till the Centre framed rules on it.The court also stayed a section of the amended law that provided for derecognition as soon as inquiry by an officer above the rank of collector begins into the status of a property as waqf, saying that it was prima facie arbitrary and not in line with separation of powers. It said that a determination by the official could not be treated as final, and as conceded by solicitor general Tushar Mehta during the hearings, could be challenged before the waqf tribunal and jurisdictional HCs.Even as Supreme Court on Monday stayed some provisions of Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, it found no merit in the challenge to the provision for inquiry into govt land being declared waqf property by an officer above the rank of collector and said, ""The govt holds the property in trust for its citizens. Any person who has wrongful possession of such property cannot be permitted to claim the same as his own property.""The bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih said that once the inquiry commences to determine whether a govt property has been wrongly identified or declared as waqf, the mutawalli of waqf board cannot create third-party interest in the property till the final adjudication by judiciary.SC rejected the arguments of challengers to the provision in the Waqf Act confining waqf only to Muslims and barring non-Muslims from dedicating their properties. SC said as the petitioners argued that waqf is specific to Islam, deletion of non-Muslims from the ambit of donation is not arbitrary. ""In any case, if such a person desires to donate his property, he can do so by giving or donating it to a trust or creating a trust for any of the purposes which were included in Section 104 of the Waqf Act, 1995,"" the bench said.To preserve religious character of Central Waqf Council and state waqf boards, the bench directed the Centre and states not to have more than four and three non-Muslims in the council and each board, respectively, recording the assurance by the SG during the hearing. SC also told the states to, as far as possible, avoid appointment of a non-Muslim chief executive officer, who is a serving joint secretary, of the waqf boards. The court refused to stay some provisions: challenge in court, in joint parliamentary committee, and Parliament, deletion of provision which barred non-Muslims from creating waqfs, application of Limitations Act to waqf properties, bar on tribal lands from being declared waqf, bar on declaring ASI properties to be waqf.On another intensely contested provision of abolishing 'waqf by user' provision, the bench said right from 1923 there had been a mandatory provision for registration of waqf property. ""We are, therefore, of the view that if mutawallis for a period of 102 years could not get waqf registered, as required under the earlier provisions, they cannot claim that they be allowed to continue with the waqf even if they are not registered,"" it said. ""If the legislature, on noticing misuse of the waqf properties, finds that after the enactment of the impugned Act all such applications should be accompanied by a copy of the waqf deed, the same cannot be said to be arbitrary,"" SC said.It also found no illegality in the prospective abolition of the 'waqf by user' clause. ""We are of the view that if the legislature, in 2025, finds that on account of the concept of 'waqf by user', huge govt properties have been encroached upon and to stop the menace, it takes steps for deletion of the said provision, the said amendment, prima facie, cannot be said to be arbitrary,"" bench said, and cited how in Andhra Pradesh the state waqf board notified thousands of acres of govt land as waqf and which was set aside by SC.","Supreme court refused to stay the waqf (amendment) act, 2025. It suspended implementation of 'five-year practice of islam' for dedicating a property to waqf.

5-year Islam practice clause put on hold: Supreme Court imposes partial stay on Waqf Act; 3 key provisions stayed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-year-islam-practice-clause-put-on-hold-sc-imposes-partial-stay-on-waqf-act-3-key-provisions-stayed/articleshow/123893064.cms,"Supreme Court

Here are the three key provisions that SC stayed -



Five-year practice rule: The court stayed the requirement that a person must have practised Islam for at least five years before creating a waqf. The court noted that, without rules framed by state governments to determine such eligibility, the clause could lead to arbitrariness.

Non-Muslim representation cap: The court restricted the presence of non-Muslims in Waqf bodies. It ruled that the number of non-Muslim members in the Central Waqf Council cannot exceed four, and imposed similar limits on State Waqf Boards. However, it did not stay the provision allowing a non-Muslim to serve as CEO of a State Waqf Board, though it said a Muslim should be appointed “as far as possible.”

Encroachment disputes freeze: The court froze the clause empowering the government to derecognise Waqf land while a dispute over encroachment is pending before a government officer. Calling such powers contrary to the separation of powers, the court said that disputed Waqf land will remain protected until title is decided by a tribunal or court, and no third-party rights should be created during this period.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday refused to put the entire Waqf law on hold, citing the ""presumption"" of constitutionality in its favour, but stayed the operation of key provisions -- including the clause requiring a person to have practised Islam for five years to create a waqf.However, the top court said, ""some sections need some protection."" It also directed that, as far as possible, the Chief Executive Officer of the Waqf Board should be a Muslim, but allowed the amendment that permits a non-Muslim to be appointed as CEO.The court further said that a government official’s report on whether a property is valid Waqf land would not change the title of the property without approval from the high court. During this process, the Waqf Board cannot create third-party rights over the disputed property.A bench of Chief Justice BR Gavai and Justice AG Masih said courts should normally treat laws passed by Parliament as valid and should only grant a stay in very rare cases.CJI BR Gavai, writing the interim order, said that although the Supreme Court is not issuing a binding direction, it would be appropriate for the Centre not to nominate more than three non-Muslims to the 11-member Central Waqf Council and to ensure that the ex-officio chairperson is from the Muslim community.On May 22, a bench led by CJI Gavai had reserved interim orders after extensive hearings from both sides.Earlier, on April 25, the Union ministry of minority affairs submitted a massive 1,332-page affidavit defending the law, urging the court not to grant a “blanket stay” on a statute that carries the presumption of constitutionality because it was enacted by Parliament.The Centre had notified the amended law on April 8 after receiving President Droupadi Murmu’s assent on April 5. The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025 itself had cleared the Lok Sabha on April 3 and the Rajya Sabha a day later, setting the stage for the current legal challenge.","Supreme court declines to put entire waqf law on hold, citing ""presumption"" of constitutionality in its favour.

WHY DIDN’T THEY ASK MATHEW? There was constant speculation over whether Agatha Christie ever came to India, but never any proof, even though she was known to be an avid traveller. Now, her grandson tells writer Manjiri Prabhu that she definitely had visited — not once, but twice

Mathew Prichard (also in photo right), who’s settled the India question once and for all, with his grandmother Agatha Christie

The following are extracts from two letters that Christie wrote to Edmund Cork in Cyprus, her literary agent and lifelong friend.

Jan 11, 1960 |

Jan 20, 1960 |

Another letter was from Christie, then staying at the Ashoka Hotel in New Delhi, to Rosalind, her daughter.

Feb 16, 1960 |

Oct 30, 1961 |

From Delhi, she wrote again to Rosalind.

Some mysteries need to be actively cracked, but some solve themselves with time.There has been constant speculation about Agatha Christie’s India connection. One question has recurred over the years, but has never really been accurately answered: did Agatha Christie ever visit India? The internet and popular belief will state that she did not. I, too, had often puzzled over how Christie, a world traveller, had never actually been to India. In fact, in a video in 2021, I had even concluded that she indeed hadn’t.Until one cool but sunny Easter day in Wales.In March 2024, I met Christie’s grandson, Mathew Prichard, and his lovely wife Lucy, at their charming home in Wales. Prichard, now in his 80s, had been very close to his grandmother.It was a memorable day, but it turned momentous when Mathew showed me Christie’s personal memorabilia — her passports, her first typed and edited manuscripts, rare photos, her camera, and her last portrait painting, which hung on one of the walls of his house.When Mathew signed and gifted me a copy of his grandmother’s latest biography, I also realised what a mammoth task he had been entrusted with — to preserve her legacy, and how he had upheld that trust: a proud grandson of the Queen of Crime.It was when I mentioned how strange it was that Christie had never visited India, that he glanced at me with a twinkle in his blue eyes, and said, “Oh, but she did!” I was startled. This was contrary to all that we believed. A few minutes later, as I skimmed through the numerous black-and-white, well-preserved photos, I found some that made my heart race — pictures of Christie with a garland, descending from an Indian Airlines plane. Here, finally, was the missing link to a long-standing puzzle.I was on the threshold of solving a real mystery, but I needed to know more. At my request, the archivist Joseph Keogh dug deeper and came up with some fascinating, unpublicised facts. Christie had indeed visited India — not once, but twice. From her passport stamps, he traced her travel itinerary for the two trips.Her first trip was in Jan 1960, when she visited Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka), then India and Pakistan. From Jan 11 to Feb 2, she travelled to Bombay (now Mumbai), headed to South India’s Madras (now Chennai), did some sightseeing at the Ajanta Caves, and then on to Delhi. Between Feb 2 and 9, she went to Nepal and returned to Patna and Delhi, finally leaving for Karachi on Feb 17.Some letters were also found that referenced her trips. It appeared that the 1960 trip was for a lecture tour by her second husband, the archaeologist Max Mallowan.Future plans are, roughly, leave for Madras today — go via southern India to Bombay arriving 17th or 18th — Then some sightseeing near Bombay Agenta Caves (sic) etc and on to Delhi and then to Nepal on Jan 31st for a week — c/o British Embassy would find us there as I’m not sure what the hotel is.Our plans are a bit different at the moment as accommodation at hotels is very hard to get exactly when one wants it but we shall be in and out of the Ashoka Hotel at Delhi between Jan 28th and Feb 2nd — and then Nepal (c/o British Embassy Kathmandu) 2nd to 9th then in and out of Ashoka again finally leaving it on Feb 17th for Karachi. So forward anything you think I ought to see to the Ashoka at Delhi — but nothing that I needn’t!!On our arrival here yesterday evening, several archaeologists were waiting with two porters and loads of archaeological material from their… dig. The examination of same intrigued the Ashoka guests very much.Christie’s second trip to India, a year later, seemed to be for leisure. The passport has a Palam, New Delhi stamp (month not specified) in 1961. This time she visited Srinagar in Kashmir and stayed at the Oberoi Palace. This is what she wrote to her daughter Rosalind:Lake and mountains rather lovely. This is a Hotel rather like at Jaipur — converted Rajah’s Palace — miles and miles of corridors — enormous rooms and we are in a kind of supersuite looking over lake. It’s all terribly dried up by this time of year — one ought really to come in May-June. Now one must be content by rich beds of red salvia and dahlias in the Hotel garden. Temp is about 50 at night. Delicious hot sun to sit in and about 60 in day. Suits me very well. We made some excursions — to the various Mogul gardens — and to a lake… which is very beautiful and ringed with snowclad mountains. You can see the mountains now after the rain. We have to leave here and go to the Hotel in the town — but expect that our booking for Nov 2nd to Delhi will be all right.Here we are in the Ashoka. I’m glad we had a good ten days and in a perfect Hotel for old ladies (very few of them nowadays) where I could sit, in the sun — and look at a view like a Japanese print. Lovely! The letters revealed Christie’s bright, chirpy personality and tongue-in-cheek humour, her eagerness to explore India and her appreciation of scenic beauty. She seemed happy to be in India.But I pondered why her trips were not well-known. Was it because photographs were a rarity then or because she checked into the hotels in her husband’s name — or perhaps simply because Agatha Christie was a private person?Whatever the reason, I was thrilled with my discovery. That sunny day with Mathew, Lucy and Gwynnie the dog carried an extra fulfilling zing because of this exciting revelation.I had always sensed a deep connection to Agatha Christie. But being the chosen one to unravel the mystery of her India trips felt truly special.The author is an award-winning writer of mystery novels[Extracts and photographs used with permission from Mathew Prichard and The Christie Archive Trust.

Dar said the train’s capacity is limited to around 180 metric tonnes and is still in its infancy. “Our priority will be to keep the Srinagar-Jammu highway open for traffic,” he added.Chief minister Omar Abdullah Monday said, “If the Centre is unable to open and maintain it, they should hand it over to us.”Omar said he would speak to Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari to press for the immediate reopening of the road.Earlier, the LG said the 7-day-a-week parcel train will transport 23–24 tonnes of apples and other perishable goods every day.“This will provide a faster and more economical transportation mode, strengthen market linkages, and bring improvement in the lives and livelihoods of farmers,” Sinha said.Kashmir Valley Fruit Growers Union president Bashir Ahmad Basheer told TOI, “Early varieties like Gala are already perishing on the highway, as fruit-laden vehicles have not moved beyond Qazigund in the past eight days. This is a serious crisis.”Mandi representatives in Sopore, home to Kashmir’s oldest fruit market, demanded that if the administration cannot restore the Srinagar-Jammu highway, control should be handed over to the Army, “which can make it operational within a day.”Peoples Conference chairman Sajad Lone accused the Omar govt of wandering aimlessly on the issue. “Inclement weather is not the fault of the govt. But sitting like a mute spectator and doing nothing is criminal,” Lone said, urging the CM to “sit with your officers and stakeholders and work out a strategy.”Iltija Mufti, PDP representative, accused the govt of “not acting” on the crucial issue.",Jammu and kashmir lieutenant governor manoj sinha flagged off the first dedicated parcel train from budgam to new delhi monday.
