Every instance of failure to act in financial matters not white-collar crime: Ex-CJI Sanjiv Khanna,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/every-instance-of-failure-to-act-in-financial-matters-not-white-collar-crime-ex-cji-sanjiv-khanna/articleshow/124493570.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former chief justice of India Sanjiv Khanna said on Saturday that every instance of failure to act in matters that have financial implications cannot be termed a white-collar crime.He said this while speaking at the ""National Conference on White Collar Crime"", organised by the Terapanth Professional Forum.""White-collar crime is a cliche which we hear every day in, day out, but very few of us really understand what is a white-collar crime. This expression was coined in 1939 by a sociologist, who described it as a non-violent offence committed by individuals of position and responsibility,"" Justice Khanna said.He said these crimes are committed by people in positions of trust, authority or respectability, usually for personal or organisational gain, and these are generally non-violent and economic in nature.""Yes, white-collar crimes can also lead to violence and they are then classified as red-collar crimes. Now, it will be wrong to say that every act of failure to act that has financial implications is a white-collar crime.To me, financial or monetary wrongs can be divided into three categories,"" the former CJI said.He said the first category includes crimes motivated by greed or advantage, such as fraud, embezzlement, insider trading, cyber crime, money laundering, intentional tax evasion, bribery and corruption.""The second category of wrongdoings is unintentional, largely due to a lack of awareness or knowledge. It is without malicious or bad mental intent. The third category of financial crimes are technical or procedural wrongs, like not taking prior permission, filing errors, compliance oversight, which happens due to a misunderstanding of law or lack of awareness,"" Justice Khanna said.He said a difficulty arises when the legislature equates the first category of white-collar crimes with other categories, or a disproportionate punishment is prescribed with penalties or even a sentence of imprisonment, notwithstanding that the lapse is involuntary or without the intent to gain financially or cause harm, but on account of lack of awareness or confusion.""This morning, I read in the papers that there is active discussion going on to reduce the number of offences under the Income Tax Act. While these moves are right, at the same time, white-collar crimes, especially cyber crimes, are increasing. The only way to deal with it is public awareness and knowledge that you can be subjected to a white-collar crime,"" Justice Khanna said.The former CJI said nothing prevents an individual from approaching police in case of falling prey to white-collar crimes.Posing a question for lawyers, he said, ""How many of you have ever written to the government that your client, who is briefing you, has indulged in money laundering? I do not think anybody would have done it. All of us have been brought up to understand that there is a professional privilege.""I am looking forward to the day when a taxpayer approaches his accountant, chartered accountant, lawyer with the question, 'please tell me what is the right amount of tax I have to pay', and not with the question, 'please tell me how I can reduce or evade taxes'. The day that happens, a lot of things will change.""Justice Khanna said people are afraid to go to law-enforcement agencies in case of being victims of white-collar crimes because going to such government authorities is a ""Herculean task"" and ""a source of harassment"".""And that fear factor, invariably, is used by cyber criminals to digitally arrest you or swindle you. There has to be a change in the mindset of the ordinary people when they deal with this situation. You should be able to have the courage to go to law-enforcement agencies and not fear.""You should not feel that if I go to a law-enforcement agency, I will be harassed more, I would rather pay up the amount demanded,"" the former CJI said.","Former chief justice of india sanjiv khanna says every failure to act in matters that have financial implications cannot be termed a white-collar crime.

""In my view, such cases must be dealt with differently,"" he remarked. ""While ignorance of the law cannot be an excuse, the real difficulty arises when the legislature equates white-collar crimes with conventional offences, ignoring the degree of intent and mental element involved"", he added.He noted that financial offences can broadly be classified into three categories, those committed with clear criminal intent, those arising from negligence or misunderstanding and those resulting from procedural lapses.""He emphasised that mental intent, is the key differentiator.Justice Khanna also expressed concern over the growing trend of reverse burden of proof in financial legislations, where the accused must prove their innocence rather than the prosecution proving guilt. Such provisions, he said, must be applied with caution. Further, the CJI added that the law must distinguish between those who act with mala fide intent and those who commit errors without any corrupt motive.","Former chief justice of india, justice sanjiv khanna, called for a more sensitive and nuanced approach in the application of laws that govern financial frauds.

PM Modi's BIG OUTREACH To India's Farmers, Launches Agri Schemes Worth ₹35,000 Crore Before Diwali

NEW DELHI: With the campaign for Bihar elections gathering pace, PM Modi on Saturday launched two mega central schemes with a total outlay of Rs 35,440 crore to transform 100 low-performing agri-districts and increase production of pulses to reduce imports, urging farmers to focus on both selfreliance and exports.Addressing a gathering of farmers and farm policymakers at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, he said, “On one hand, we will have to be self-sufficient, while on the other hand, we will have to produce for the global market...We have to focus on those crops which can dominate the world agri market. These two schemes – PM Dhan Dhaanya Krishi Yojana (with an outlay of Rs 24,000 crore for 100 lowperforming districts) and Mission for self-sufficiency in pulses (with an outlay of Rs 11,440 crore) – will play vital roles in this journey. He further emphasised farmers’ vital contribution in making the country self-reliant in food production and calling upon them to lead the way in building a developed India.On the occasion, he also virtually inaugurated 1,054 completed projects valued at over Rs 5,450 crore and laid foundation stones for an additional 50 projects, worth around Rs 815 crore, relating to agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries, and food processing sectors.Both the newly launched centralschemeswill be implemented from the upcoming rabi (winter sowing) season, extending till 2030-31. Under the PM Dhan Dhaanya Yojana for 100 low-productivity districts, farm output will be enhanced through various interventions, including a focus on higher irrigation coverage and crop diversification.Among the 100 identified districts, Uttar Pradesh accounts for the highest number (12). It is followed by Maharashtra (9); Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan (8); Bihar (7); Gujarat, Tamil Nadu , Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha and West Bengal (4); Assam, Kerala and Chhattisgarh (3); and Jharkhand, Uttarakhand and UT of J&K (2).These districts have been identified based on three factors: low productivity, moderate crop intensity and belowaverage access to credit. Thirty-six different schemes of 11 departments will be converged to implement the programme. “We have often heard the phrase ‘36 ka aankda’; a way of saying that two parties are completely at odds with each other. But as a government, we challenge such perceptions and reverse them,” PM Modi said, underlining that the govt has brought together 36 schemes under PM DhanDhaanya Krishi Yojana to develop the identified districts.","Pm modi urges farmers to focus on both selfreliance and exports.

Threats faced by girls now extend into the digital world, says

CJI

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice B R Gavai on Saturday said despite constitutional guarantees, many girls continue to be tragically denied their fundamental rights and even basic necessities for survival and face harmful practices like female genital mutilation (FGM). Interestingly, a PIL challenging the validity of FGM, practised among certain Muslims, is pending before a ninejudge SC bench, which is also seized of the challenge to alleged discriminatory practices against women at Sabarimala, Agiyari of Parsi communities and mosques.A a national consultation on ‘Safeguarding the girl child: towards a safer and enabling environment for her in India’ organised by juvenile justice committee headed by Justice B V Nagarathna, CJI B R Gavai said, “This vulnerability exposes them (girls) to disproportionately high risks of sexual abuse, exploitation, & harmful practices such as FGM, malnutrition, sex-selective abortions, trafficking, and child marriage against their will. ” He said advancement in technology, though empowering, has given rise to new vulnerabilities for the female child.“Threats faced by young girls are no longer confined to physical spaces, they extend into the digital world. From online harassment, cyberbullying, and digital stalking to misuse of personal data and deep fake imagery, the challenges have evolved in both scale and sophistication,” the CJI said. Calling upon institutions, policy makers & enforcement authorities to realise realities of presentera challenges, he said technology must serve as a tool for liberation rather than exploitation.“Safeguarding the girl child today means securing her future in classrooms, workplaces, and on every screen she encounters,” he said. Justice Nagarathna said, “A young girl in India can be said to be a truly equal citizen only when she can freely aspire to do anything that her male counterpart does and receive the same quality of support and resources to do so, facing no barriers specific.”","Cji br gavai: threats faced by girls now extend into the digital world.

NEW DELHI: Notorious fugitive gangster Rashid Cablewala, who has been linked to several murders in Delhi, was detained in Azerbaijan on arriving from Istanbul, sources confirmed, with Indian intelligence agencies now gearing up to bring him back, reports Rajshekhar Jha.It is unclear whether he was imprisoned there or kept under surveillance post-bond. Cablewala, who is on the ‘most wanted’ list, was detained by immigration authorities at Baku’s Heydar Aliyev International Airport due to “anomalies in his travel documents”, a relative said. A senior cop confirmed the developments and said they would share details of his criminal history and dossier through appropriate channels.Cablewala is a close associate of jailed gangster Hashim Baba and was handling operations for the gang. He is also linked to the Lawrence Bishnoi syndicate. His name emerged in the killing of businessman Nadir Shah in Greater Kailash-I in Sept last year. He was then accused of a double murder in east Delhi on th e night of Diwali in Oct 2024. When his name croopped up again, in the killing of businessman Sunil Jain in east Delhi’s Krishna Nagar last Dec, Cablewala became one of Delhi Police ’s most sought-after fugitives.Speaking with TOI from an undisclosed location in December 2024, Cablewala claimed that Jain’s murder was “retribution” for the twin murders reported from the same area in Oct but denied his involvement. Cablewala told TOI that Sachin alias Golu was one of the assailants who had accepted payment from two parties to kill another individual. “Jain was not the target. The target was this man named Virat and he will be eliminated. ..,” he had revealed.Sources said Sachin was still on the run and may have fled abroad too.Authorities said Hashim Baba and Cablewala shared an extensive history. They initially gained notoriety when they, along with their former associate Nasir, eliminated Akil Mama during a funeral in 2013. Following Nasir’s imprisonment, Hashim Baba and Cablewala assumed control of the gang. They eventually separated and established their individual operations.A history-sheeter linked to multiple homicide cases, Cablewala carried a reward of Rs 1 lakh before his arrest in 2018. At the time, he was apprehended while attempting to escape to Saudi Arabia. He established a garments enterprise in Riyadh and was expanding into Thailand. This, investigators said, was to launder illicit proceeds. In 2019, he was charged under MCOCA by the crime branch. In 2020, he was apprehended again by the special cell. He escaped using a forged passport in early 2022.","Rashid cablewala was detained by immigration authorities at baku’s heydar aliyev international airport due to “anomalies in his travel documents”, a relative said.

IPS Officer 'Suicide': Wife Seeks FIR Against Haryana DGP, Rohtak SP Over 'Harassment And Abetment'

Body taken to mortuary but autopsy put off

Pressure on Haryana governement to take action against DGP

CHANDIGARH: In the strongest commitment yet of action in the alleged suicide of senior IPS officer Y Puran Kumar, Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini warned on Saturday that no one will be spared, “no matter how influential”.The CM’s statement came hours after Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya was removed from his post. Bijarniya has not been given any posting and will be attached to police HQ in Panchkula. Bijarniya and Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur were named in Puran Kumar’s suicide note and his wife IAS officer Amneet P Kumar’s complaint to policeas the alleged “harassers” who drove him to suicide.Amneet has refused to allow an autopsy of her husband’s body until action is taken against the DGP & SP. It has been nearly five days since Puran Kumar’s suicide. On Saturday evening, while addressing the BJP state executive in Panchkula, Saini began by offering condolences to the deceased IPS officer. He expressed solidarity with the IPS officer’s family and said: “Our governement will conduct a thorough investigation into this matter.” He urged the opposition not to play politics.Chandigarh police faced backlash from the family of the IPS officer when it tried to get an autopsy done on Saturday, leading DGP Sagarpreet Hooda to say that the postmortem would not be conducted until the family agreed, reports Pawan Tiwari.Wife Amneet’s brother Amit Rattan, an AAP MLA, alleged police shifted the body without notifying the kin. The body was moved to PGI mortuary, where a team was ready for an autopsy. However, the family’s objection forced police put it on hold. DGP Hooda, IG Pushpendra Kumar & SSP Kanwardeep Kaur went to Amneet to get her nod, but she refused.Amneet P Kumar was a member of Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini’s delegation on an official tour of Japan when her husband, Y Puran Kumar, allegedly shot himself dead. She flew home immediately. On returning from Japan, CM Saini had called on Amneet at her Chandigarh residence.During the meeting, Amneet had handed him a two-page letter seeking justice and protection for her family and action against those named in the suicide note, especially DGP Shatrujeet Kapur and then Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya, for abetting her husband’s “suicide”. Two days later, on Saturday, Haryana governement removed Bijarniya and replaced him with IPS officer Surinder Singh Bhoria. This was the first action initiated by governement. Pressure is mounting on the governement to take action against Kapur as well. There is intense speculation that he may be asked to go on leave, but till Saturday evening there was no word from governement.The question in bureaucratic circles is whether governement will take action against the DGP. A section of Haryana IAS officers has also demanded Kapur’s arrest. Amneet said a “false FIR” registered in Rohtak was the “trigger point” for her husband’s “suicide”. Bijarniya was the supervising officer of the case in which head constable Sushil Kumar, PSO to Puran Kumar when he was IG Rohtak, was arrested on allegations of extortion. Police claimed Sushil had “confessed” during questioning that he had demanded money on behalf of Puran Kumar.A day after the IPS officer died, Bijarniya said, “The complainant provided audio-visual evidence which led to Sushil’s arrest. He was taken into custody for two days and confessed to demanding on behalf of Kumar. We were in the process of further investigation when we came to know about this incident (Kumar’s alleged suicide).” Kumar was shifted out as IGP (Rohtak range) on September 29. Sushil was arrested soon after. A day after the FIR was lodged, Kumar allegedly died by suicide. State chief secretary Anurag Rastogi and ACS-home Sumita Misra spent almost the entire Friday trying to pacify Amneet, but she stuck to her stand.",Haryana chief minister nayab singh saini warns that no one will be spared.

Denial of justice

, says lawyer on repeated recusals

DEHRADUN: In what is being termed an unprecedented series of recusals, another judge has decided to withdraw from a case involving Uttarakhand-cadre Indian Forest Service officer Sanjiv Chaturvedi. Justice Alok Verma of the Uttarakhand high court became the 16th judge to recuse from Chaturvedi’s case, and the second one within a fortnight. Verma’s recusal order, dated Oct 8, simply stated, “List before another bench,” without assigning any reason continuing a pattern seen in previous recusals in Chaturvedi’s matters.Sanjiv Chaturvedi’s counsel, Sudershan Goel, termed the repeated recusals “a denial of justice” and an infringement of his client’s constitutional right. “Judges usually recuse themselves when they have previously represented a party, share a familial relation, or have a financial association. Any other or non-reasoned recusal amounts to impropriety and betrayal of the constitutional oath of office,” he said.Verma’s withdrawal comes 12 days after Justice Ravindra Maithani of Uttarakhand HC similarly recused himself from hearing one of Chaturvedi’s cases. The present matter involves a contempt petition filed by Chaturvedi against CAT members and the registry for alleged wilful disobedience of a stay order.Advocate Goel said this sets a record in the judicial history of the country, as never before have so many judges recused from hearing cases of a particular person.","Justice alok verma of the uttarakhand high court became the 16th judge to recuse from chaturvedi’s case, and the second one within a fortnight.

RPL, its top execs accused of alleged diversion of funds



NEW DELHI: The ED late on Friday arrested Reliance Power’s chief financial officer Ashok Pal after questioning him at its headquarters here in a case of fake bank guarantee. He was produced before a court here on Saturday and remanded in two days of ED custody. Pal, the CFO of Reliance Power Limited (RPL), an Anil Ambani Reliance group company, has been taken into custody in an ongoing money laundering probe related to banking fraud against Ambani and his group entities. “The degree of fraud can be gauged from the fact that Reliance Power group submitted a bank guarantee from FirstRand Bank, Manila, Philippines. The fact is that there exists no branch of FirstRand Bank in the Philippines,” sources said.Fake and spoofed domains of commercial banks, such as sbi.17313@s-bi.co.in a look alike of SBI email was created by inserting a hyphen to commit the fraud, an official said. Similar emails of other PSU banks have also been used by the accused. Reliance Power Limited (RPL) is a listed company where public holds more than 75% shares. The company and its top executives are accused of alleged diversion of funds. “Board resolution empowered CFO Ashok Pal and others to finalise, approve, sign and execute all documents for Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) BESS tender, and to use RPL’s financial capability for the bid,” the agency sources said.In a statement, RPL said, “The company & its subsidiaries acted bonafidely and are a victim of fraud, forgery and cheating conspiracy. We also wish to clarify on media reports that Anil D Ambani is not on Board of Reliance Power Limited for more than 3.5 years and is not concerned with this matter in any manner.”On Aug 1, ED had conducted searches at three premises in Bhubaneswar and one at Kolkata after its investigators found alleged evidence of Rs 68 crore fake bank guarantee provided to SECI on behalf of Reliance NU BESS Ltd/Maharashtra Energy Generation Ltd. The fake bank guarantee was generated by a shell entity registered at Bhubaneswar, allegedly linked to Anil Ambani group. Spoofed email accounts were created to make them look genuine, sources said. Besides the allegedly forged bank guarantee, Anil Ambani’s Reliance group is also being probed for alleged fake bills for commission. The agency sources alleged that Pal “played crucial role in submitting a bogus bank guarantee of over Rs 68 crore to SECI, with an intention to cheat the PSU”. The probe has revealed that Pal was instrumental in selecting Biswal Tradelink Pvt Ltd to provide fake bank guarantee. Director of BTPL Partha Sarathi Biswal was arrested earlier and is currently in judicial custody. ED also found alleged diversion of money through fake transport invoices of several crores of rupees.","Ashok pal was produced before a court here on saturday and remanded in two days of ed custody.

SIT: Cough syrup case exposes deep systemic failures

BHOPAL: The MP SIT probing the Coldrif tragedy that claimed the lives of 20 kids from Chhindwara and three from other districts is examining the entire supply chain of the cough syrup — from procurement of raw materials to distribution of the contaminated drug — aiming to fix accountability at every stage.Investigators confirmed that Ranganathan Govindan, owner of TN-based Sresan Pharmaceuticals, had procured banned industrial-grade diethylene glycol for manufacturing Coldrif. The SIT is now trying to determine how long the chemical had been in use and whether other individuals or suppliers were complicit in the process.Ranganathan initially feigned ignorance about the cause of contamination, claiming he had delegated production responsibilities to subordinates.Drugs Controller General of India Friday made it mandatory for all raw materials and finished pharmaceutical products to be tested for diethylene glycol (DEG) and ethylene glycol (EG). Testing was earlier required only on raw materials, leaving a gap for toxic solvents to enter the manufacturing process.Ranganathan Govindan, owner of TNbased Sresan Pharmaceuticals, initially said he had no direct knowledge of how the industrial chemical entered the formulation.However, after sustained interrogation, Ranganathan reportedly confessed.“He has identified the person in charge of quality control, who will be detained soon. But this does not absolve Ranganathan of responsibility — he was the signatory authority and owner of the unit,” said a senior officer privy to the probe. The 12-member SIT, led by additional superintendent of police Anjana Tiwari, includes senior police officials and drug control officers. The team has divided its work among sub-groups — one focusing on the manufacturing trail in Tamil Nadu, another on the distribution and retail network in MP, and a third on forensic and toxicological analysis.“We are also looking into the factory’s production system — whether it was automated or semi-automated — besides examining if there was any sabotage angle,” an officer said, adding the technical team is reviewing machinery logs and batch production records to detect irregularities in the blending and testing process. Officials said more arrests are likely as the SIT expands its investigation to include the quality control team, raw material suppliers, and logistics handlers.Tamil Nadu authorities have already sealed Sresan Pharmaceuticals’ manufacturing unit in Sunguvarchatram, Kanchipuram district, after laboratory tests confirmed 48.6% DEG content in the syrup. “This case has exposed deep systemic failures — not just negligence, but a collapse of safety and compliance mechanisms. The probe will continue until every link in the chain is held accountable,” an Special Investigation Team member said. Meanwhile, three children remain in critical condition at hospitals in Nagpur. Teams of doctors and Madhya Pradesh health officials are monitoring their condition round the clock.","G ranganathan govindan, owner of tn-based sresan pharmaceuticals, had procured banned industrial-grade diethylene glycol for manufacturing coldrif.

Deadly Cough Syrup Case: WHO Points To Regulatory Gap In India

BHOPAL: After the death of 23 children in Madhya Pradesh, including 20 from Chhindwara, following the consumption of Coldrif, a cough syrup laced with the killer chemical diethylene glycol (DEG), Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) Friday made it mandatory to test for both DEG and ethylene glycol (EG) in all raw materials and finished pharmaceutical products.Earlier, such testing was required only for raw materials, leaving a crucial gap that allowed toxic solvents to enter finished syrups undetected. DCGI, which heads Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), is responsible for approving, regulating, and monitoring the quality of medicines in India. Moved by the disaster, Madhya Pradesh Food and Drugs Administration (MPFDA) wrote to DCGI Thursday, urging it to include DEG and EG testing in the “general monograph of the Indian Pharmacopoeia” (IP) — the national rulebook that sets quality standards and test methods for medicines sold in India.Within a few hours of receiving the MPFDA letter, DCGI notified the amendment and directed Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission (IPC) — the autonomous scientific body under Union ministry of health and family welfare responsible for setting and updating India’s official drug standards — to take immediate action. IPC Friday issued ‘Amendment List-09’ to IP 2022, officially introducing DEG and EG testing as a mandatory requirement for all oral liquid formulations.It also issued a circular across India, informing all state drug controllers, CDSCO zonal offices, members of the scientific body of IPC, directors of drug testing laboratories, and major industry associations, including IDMA, OPPI, BDMA, FOPE, FSSAI, and SmallScale Industry Associations, to enforce the new testing standards without delay.The order, signed by IPC secretary-cum-scientific director Dr V Kalaiselvan, directs that the amount of DEG and EG shall not exceed 0.10% and must be determined by gas chromatography. TOI is in possession of the MPFDA’s letter to DCGI and the IPC circular. “This closes a critical regulatory loophole exposed by repeated syrup-linked deaths,” an official said, calling it a decisive step toward restoring public trust in India’s drug safety system.","Earlier, such testing was required only for raw materials, leaving a crucial gap that allowed toxic solvents to enter finished syrups undetected.

JAIPUR: A single judge bench of Rajasthan high court (HC) permitted an NEET-UG aspirant to participate in counselling after he was denied admission and his security deposit forfeited due to a minor delay in fee payment. The order was issued on Wednesday during a hearing of the petition filed by the candidate, Narendra Mahala.Justice Sameer Jain's bench ruled that forfeiture of the petitioner's Rs 5 lakh security deposit by the counselling board was arbitrary and constituted ""unjust enrichment"".""The court directed the authorities to permit the student to participate in the third round of counselling and ordered his security deposit to be adjusted against fees of any college he is allotted on merit,"" Tanveer Ahamad, the petitioner's advocate, said.Ahamad said Narendra Mahala, a fatherless student from a modest background, was unable to deposit the full college fee within the stipulated deadline due to death of his great-grandmother on Sept 29, and intervening public holidays. ""Court found delay of a few hours to be bona fide and reasonable,"" Ahamad said.Criticising the mechanical approach of authorities, Justice Jain stated that rigid deadlines should not override principles of equity and welfare, especially in education.""In the tussle between merit and money, the future of bona fide aspirants should not suffer,"" the court observed.Describing the case as an ""unambiguous illustration of the principles governing unjust enrichment,"" the court also directed that a copy of the order be sent to National Medical Commission, secretary of ministry of health and family welfare, and chief secretary, Rajasthan govt, for appropriate scrutiny. It also requested its order in this case to be treated as a precedent, Ahamad said.","A single judge bench of rajasthan high court permitted an neet-ug aspirant to participate in counselling.

RANCHI/GUWAHATI: Central Reserve Police Force ( CRPF ) head constable Mahendra Laskar was killed and two colleagues were wounded after two IEDs planted by Maoists exploded during an anti-insurgency operation in Saranda forest of Jharkhand's West Singhbhum district Friday night.Police said Saturday that Laskar, a 45-year-old native of Nagaon district in Assam, died during treatment at a private hospital in Odisha's Rourkela. Two others - inspector KK Mishra and ASI Ram Krishna Gogi - were wounded but are now stable.The explosions occurred when a joint team of Jharkhand police and CRPF personnel was carrying out a search operation in Saranda. Mishra was wounded in the first blast, while Laskar and Gogi were hit by the second.

CBSE exam: Are teachers ready for big shift from rote learning?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cbse-exam-are-teachers-ready-for-big-shift-from-rote-learning/articleshow/124490148.cms,"The NEP 2020 aims to shift learning from rote memorisation to skill-based education, focusing on critical thinking, and real-world application

MUMBAI: CBSE board exams are set to undergo a radical transformation, shifting from memory-based testing to assessments that measure understanding, analysis & real-world application. While the students may adapt quickly, the bigger concern is whether teachers are ready for the change.Under the new structure being phased in, 80% of Class X paper will now be competency-driven, marking a major shift from decades-old focus on rote learning. Of the total marks, 40% will come from 'Higher Order Thinking Skills' multiple-choice questions testing analysis and application, another 40% from short- and long-answer questions gauging conceptual understanding, and only 20% from factual recall.The change follows the National Education Policy 2020, which called for a move from knowledge-based to competency- and skill-based learning, with emphasis on conceptual clarity, critical thinking, and real-world relevance.To support this, CBSE has rolled out multiple reforms, including two board exams each year, 20% weightage for internal assessments, and plans to introduce two compulsory vocational subjects in classes XI and XII, as announced by education minister Dharmendra Pradhan at IIT Madras.However, the success of new system depends on teachers' ability to frame & evaluate learning-based questions-a skill many currently lack. A nationwide study by the Centre for Teacher Accreditation, covering 3,000 teachers, found average subject knowledge scores at 62%, general pedagogy at 50%, and Pedagogical Content Knowledge at 53% - well below the 75% benchmark under the National Professional Standards for Teachers.""Some teachers struggle with conceptual clarity and application, while others grasp pedagogy but fail to apply it in classes,"" said CENTA CEO Ramya Venkatraman. Govt data mirrors this gap - only 26.7% of teachers have been trained in computer-based instruction, according to UDISE. CBSE exam controller Sanyam Bhardwaj said teacher training is a priority. ""This year, pedagogical training is being focused on STEM subjects,"" he said, adding that nearly all teachers have completed the mandatory 50 hours of annual training.Yet, access remains uneven. Rashmi Panagriya, principal of Skyline School in MP, said only 18 of her 24 teachers have enrolled in training, citing costs and contractual exclusions. Avnita Bir, director-principal of R N Podar School, said, ""The transition is gradual, but teachers are evolving through collaboration and mentoring.""Ultimately, as CBSE reimagines how students are tested, the success may depend upon how effectively India can train its teachers to teach the way it expects its students to learn.","80% of class x paper will now be competency-driven, marking a major shift from decades-old focus on rote learning.
