The court reserved its order on notice for July 31.ED, which recently filed a chargesheet against Vadra and others in the case, submitted that the evidence conclusively established that the offence is of money laundering, where proceeds of crime are generated, layered and enjoyed. The agency said they had shown funds flow, property and statements of witnesses.The land deal in question was executed in Feb 2008, when a Congress govt led by Bhupinder Singh Hooda was at the helm in Haryana.Special counsel Zoheb Hosain, who appeared for ED through video-conferencing, submitted that the investigation found false declarations were made in the land deal. Skylight Hospitality, a firm in which Vadra held 99% shares, purchased land measuring 3.5 acres worth crores of rupees.The sale deed falsely declared that Rs 7.5 crore had been paid, when in reality no payment was made as the cheque was never cashed. The money was paid at a later stage to avoid stamp duty, and this was corroborated by key witnesses, the counsel submitted.The land was later sold to DLF for a higher amount, and this aspect was still being scrutinised, ED told the court. The central probe agency further argued that money laundering and enjoyment of proceeds of crime continued even today.The ED chargesheet, filed on July 17, names 11 individuals and entities as accused, including Vadra, his company Skylight Hospitality, Onkareshwar Properties — which sold the land to Vadra’s firm — and its promoters/directors Satyanand Yajee & K S Virk.",Robert vadra is the husband of wayanad mp priyanka gandhi vadra.

MUMBAI: In a detailed order granting bail to a 40-year-old teacher from a prominent Mumbai school arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting a male student, a special Pocso court said that there is evidence from both sides showing that subsequently there was a consensual relationship between them. Noting the victim was over 17 years old, special judge Sabina A Malik said, ""As the accused resigned from the school, the relationship of a teacher and student no longer existed and hence, the influence is diluted."" The judge further mentioned that the trial will take time to commence and in the meantime, nothing fruitful would be gained by keeping the accused behind bars.The victim opposed the bail plea, submitting that if the woman is released on bail, she will once again find ways to manipulate, intimidate, threaten and harm his life, and she will also tamper with the evidence. However, the judge said, ""The potential risk to the victim, if any, could be catered to by imposing necessary terms and conditions. The apprehension of the prosecution can be taken care of by imposing stringent conditions on the applicant (accused),"" the judge said.Imposing conditions on the release, the judge said the accused must not meet, contact or threaten the victim in any manner. She is forbidden from directly or indirectly inducing, threatening or promising anything to any witness or the victim.The judge said breach of any of these conditions will result in immediate bail cancellation.The maximum punishment attracted in the case is imprisonment for the remainder of that person's natural life. The woman, who resigned from the school last year, was arrested on June 29. She said she is working in a different field now.

However, the complainant submitted that she was discharged from hospital only on July 9.The director of prosecution submitted before HC that the prosecution had informed the sessions court that the victim was discharged from hospital on July 3 based on information provided by the investigating officer, a point reiterated by the government prosecutor.

Removal of encroachments from govt land, land abutting water bodies, pavements and roads does not require adherence to the SOP,"" the CJI said.The order is the latest in a series of recent orders from SC and HCs frowning upon those squatting on govt land who have argued they had the right to stay put until rehabilitated on public land elsewhere.Hegde conceded the locality is on the banks of Brahmaputra but argued that even encroachers are entitled to rehabilitation. He said as many as 667 families are being rendered homeless. When he sought stay of the eviction, SC refused but sought Assam govt's response.","Assam govt accused of committing contempt of court by breaching the standard operating procedure (sop) laid down by sc on nov 13 last year.

The Central Administrative Tribunal has since stayed the suspensions.DNA's petition alleges that the report was submitted in ""undue haste"", ignoring ""critical documentation"" demonstrating the firm's efforts to manage the event inside the stadium. It argues that an event management company can't be held liable for crowd mismanagement outside the venue, which is under the government's jurisdiction.The firm has also flagged simultaneous inquiries in alleged violation of Article 20(2) of the Constitution, which prohibits multiple proceedings for the same offence.HC had taken suo motu cognizance of the stampede deaths and sought a report from the state government, following which the commission of inquiry was announced. A parallel CID investigation and a magisterial inquiry led by the deputy commissioner (Bengaluru urban) are underway.The D'Cunha commission named KSCA president Raghuram Bhat, former secretary A Shankar, ex-treasurer ES Jayaram, RCB vice-president Rajesh Menon, DNA managing director T Venkatavardhan and vice-president Sunil Mathur, among others, as responsible for the stampede.","Siddaramaiah cabinet decides to initiate legal action based on report indicting ipl franchise rcb, karnataka state cricket association (ksca) and event management firm dna entertainment networks.

There were four women Maoists among those who surrendered.About 1,570 Maoists have renounced violence and surrendered in the past 18 months.Most of the top-ranking Maoists who surrendered were from Bijapur district. These cadres include state zonal committee member (SZCM) Ramanna Irpa, carrying cash bounty of Rs 25 lakh. He surrendered along with 24 others. They carried a total bounty of Rs 1.15 crore.""Maoists, with a bounty of Rs 2.31crore, have surrendered in Bastar division under the 'Poona Margham' (rehabilitation and social integration) campaign,"" Bastar range IGP P Sundarraj said.Ramanna alias Jagdish alias Vikesh, a 37-year-old SZCM from Bijapur, was considered the ""nerve centre"" of Maoist operations in the Red Corridor linking Malkangiri in Odisha, Sukma, and Bijapur in Chhattisgarh.He was active since 2002 and commanded company number 8. Ramanna oversaw jungle warfare training, arms procurement, and coordinated major attacks on security forces across Odisha and Chhattisgarh and was involved in at least 40 incidents of violence.""I joined the Maoist organisation inspired by the 'Jal-Jungle-Jameen' campaign. But, in the past 25 years, promises that the organisations made were never met and no development done. It's a hollow ideology,"" Ramanna told mediapersons in Bijapur.""This transformation is not a coincidence, but a clear testament to the widespread acceptance of our govt's surrender and rehabilitation policy and welfare-oriented initiatives.

NEW DELHI: Just three days after Jagdeep Dhankhar created a flutter by quitting as vice president on health grounds, political circles appear to have settled into its ""business-as-usual"" rhythm. As govt and opposition trade volleys over a whole range of issues, with the usual routine of ""disruptions"" in Parliament proceedings thrown in, few seem to be lamenting the absence of the loquacious former Rajya Sabha chairman.The anger in the governing quarters with him for accepting opposition-sponsored motions for removal of Justice Yashwant Varma has given way to preoccupation with who gets to succeed him as VP. Opposition, even as it leverages the dramatic episode to seek to embarrass the government, is not mourning his abrupt exit, leaving the former VP marooned in a political no man's land.At an informal meeting of INDIA bloc parties, Rahul Gandhi and other participants are known to have argued with Dhankhar, who allegedly ""tormented"" them during his three year-tenure by his ""partisanship"".As they agitate over revision of electoral rolls in Bihar, the former VP hardly seems to be a hot priority for Parliament's monsoon session, relegating the resignation saga to the bottom of their list of priorities with a handful of opposition members being sympathetic to him.NDA parties have maintained, barring PM Narendra Modi's curt post on X, a ""radio silence"" over Dhankhar's impending departure from the Vice President's Enclave. They did not even share PM Modi's "" Dhankhar ji has got many opportunities to serve the country in various capacities, including as vice president of India. Wishing him good health"", X post.While govt officials are exploring a Type-VIII bungalow to shift Dhankhar, the developments preceding his resignation suggest that he was left with no choice but to quit as BJP and its allies were preparing to bring a no-confidence motion against him a day after he accepted the notice against Justice Varma signed by 63 opposition MPs.Sources said that the way Dhankhar accepted opposition's notice against Justice Varma even after govt had decided to bring the motion in LS with the signature of members from all parties, top members of the governing alliance were perturbed and angry and responded to the ""betrayal"" by rushing to collect signatures of MPs in the Parliament office of defence minister Rajnath Singh to bring a no-confidence motion against Dhankhar in Rajya Sabha the next day. no confidence motion against the VP can be passed with a simple majority and NDA has more than the required numbers.Sources suggested a message was conveyed to Dhankhar by an RS secretariat functionary Monday that ""either quit immediately, else face no confidence motion next day."" Instead of confronting, Dhankhar reached the Rashtrapati Bhawan, handed over his resignation letter to President Droupadi Murmu and made it public through a post on X.After accepting opposition MPs' signed letter against Justice Varma and passing a ruling from the chair, Dhankhar had become ""inaccessible"" to the senior government functionaries who tried to reach him, leading them to to skip the evening BAC meeting.Sources said the notice of LS MPs seeking removal of Justice Varma was given to speaker Om Birla by a delegation of MPs led by senior BJP functionary Ravi Shankar Prasad, who scrambled after getting to know that Dhankhar had opened channels with the opposition MPs seeking a notice in the case from them.","It's 'business-as-usual' for parties, dhankhar now marooned in a political no man's land.

This is inclusive of 21.6 lakh voters reported by booth level officers (BLOs) and political parties' booth level agents (BLAs) as deceased, 31.5 lakh as premanently migrated, seven lakh as registered at more than one place, and 1 lakh as ""untraceable"".""Should such bogus votes be allowed in violation of the Constitution,"" the CEC asked while describing SIR as ""a transparent exercise to make the electoral roll error-free, as the foundation stone of a robust democracy"". ""Time has come for all to introspect on these important questions,"" he told TOI.With just one day to go before the deadline for submission of filled and signed enumeration forms in Bihar, EC said 99% of the state's 7.9 crore are now covered under SIR, and over 91.3 forms received and digitised. ""Names of all these electors will be included in the draft electoral roll,"" EC said and added that the remaining forms are being digitised along with BLO/BLA reports to facilitate verification during the claims and objections period.With just six to seven lakh electors remaining to turn in their forms, ""BLOs and BLAs will reach out to each of them in the hours leading up to the deadline, and help them to do the needful"", said an election commission official.As per the SIR order, the draft electoral roll will be published on Aug 1, and its printed and digital copies provided to all recognised political parties, in addition to its being uploaded on the EC website.

The Congress MP said opposition would ensure that EC is held accountable.Dismissing his charges as ""baseless"" in a statement, EC said: ""It is highly unfortunate that rather than filing an election petition as per section 80 of Representation of the People (RP)Act, 1951, or if filed, awaiting verdict of HC, he has not only made baseless allegations but also chosen to threaten EC, which is a constitutional body.""With his allegations coming more than a year after the LS polls result, EC said it was wondering why ""such baseless and threatening claims were being made against it and the CEC, and that too now.""It added that the losing Congress candidates did not file a single election petition to challenge the result, despite Representation of the People Act, 1951 allowing this within 45 days of declaration of result. Others, however, did file 10 election petitions in HC.Countering Rahul's ""unwarranted threatening statements"", the Karnataka chief electoral officer (CEO) on X said copies of the draft and final electoral roll for the state's 224 assembly seats were provided to recognised parties, including Congress, on Oct 27, 2023, and Jan 22, 2024, respectively.
