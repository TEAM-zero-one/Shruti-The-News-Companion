Traffic cameras must catch picture of distracted drivers: SOP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/traffic-cameras-must-catch-picture-of-distracted-drivers-sop/articleshow/120267063.cms,"NEW DELHI: Centre wants states and local agencies to ensure cameras used for detecting traffic rule violations are capable of catching people not wearing seatbelt or helmet, driving on the wrong side, using mobile phone, and eating and drinking while driving, among other offences.The cameras should also be able to capture videos, even if vehicles are at 200kmph, state the SOP for electronic enforcement of motor vehicles law across states and UTs, which was submitted to SC by road transport and highways ministry. The SOP aims at preventing a large number of road crashes and fatalities due to wrong-side and distracted driving.The SOP was prepared following an SC order directing 23 states and 7 UTs to file compliance reports indicating the implementation of electronic monitoring as provided in central Motor Vehicles Act. The automated camera enforcement system of traffic rules is the default mode for electronic enforcement and generating prosecutable evidence, focusing on accountability of violators and enforcement agencies.As per the submitted SOP, the cameras installed should automatically generate evidence of distracted drivers, particularly of those using mobile phones, eating or drinking and not wearing seatbelt. The cameras should capture an offence, including a one second to 10 seconds video having vehicle, location, time and date details, without motion blur. The system needs to process violations within ""one"" second and generate real-time alerts for enforcement authorities.In case of driving against the flow of traffic, the system will need to use cameras, sensors and advanced algorithms to detect the violation automatically. It should be able to differentiate between actual violations and permitted movements, such as those of police, ambulance, fire brigade. It must capture high-resolution images of the violating vehicle and a five-second video before and after detection of violation.Similarly, to rein in vehicle owners and drivers who change phone numbers and addresses to evade paying fines, the ministry will have a one-time three-month window to verify and update the details, and after that it will be a prerequisite for availing any transport and driving licence-related services. The SOP specifies setting up of online systems across states to enable drivers and vehicle owners to challenge challans issued by traffic police or transport officials.","The cameras should also be able to capture videos, even if vehicles are at 200kmph, state the sop for electronic enforcement of motor vehicles law across states and uts.

Poll How do you feel about the impact of social media on public perception during crises? It's just noise, doesn't matter much. It greatly influences public opinion.

NEW DELHI: BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla on Sunday lashed out at cricketer-turned-Trinamool Congress MP Yusuf Pathan , amid ongoing violence in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district. Referring to a post on Pathan’s Instagram — where he appears relaxed and sipping tea—Poonawalla questioned the MP’s priorities as the state grapples with unrest.However, Murshidabad—the epicentre of the violence, is represented by Pathan's party colleague, Abu Taher Khan in Lok Sabha, Poonawalla still used the situation to target him and TMC over his social media post. BJP's Poonawalla also used pictures of violence-hit areas in his X post.In a post on X, he wrote: ""Bengal is burning. HC has said it can’t keep eyes closed and deployed central forces. Mamata Banerjee is encouraging such state-protected violence as police stay silent! Meanwhile, Yusuf Pathan—MP—sips tea and soaks in the moment as Hindus get slaughtered… This is TMC.""Later, speaking to ANI news agency, Poonawalla further intensified his criticism: ""Mamata Banerjee has picked up a cricketer named Yusuf Pathan from somewhere and gave him a ticket. The vote bank made him win in Baharampur and today when Bengal is burning, Hindus are being selectively killed, Yusuf Pathan is enjoying sipping tea… This is the priority of TMC.""His remarks came amid heightened tensions in parts of West Bengal, especially in Murshidabad, which has seen violent protests following changes to the Waqf law.At least three people have died and over 150 have been arrested. Several areas, including Malda, South 24 Parganas, and Murshidabad, witnessed arson, stone-pelting, and clashes with security forces.Earlier on Friday, several vehicles were set ablaze and stones were hurled at security forces. Various districts, including Malda, Murshidabad, South 24 parganas were rocked by violence.Authorities have since conducted multiple raids and deployed additional forces to restore order.","Bjp spokesperson shehzad poonawalla lashed out at cricketer-turned-trinamool congress mp yusuf pathan.

Investigation underway

NEW DELHI: The main accused wanted in connection with the kidnapping and murder of a 5-year-old girl in Karnataka's Hubballi, was killed in an encounter on Sunday while allegedly attempting to flee from the cops.Earlier in the day, a body of a girl was discovered in a tin-roofed abandoned shed, sparking outrage. Hundreds gathered outside the Ashok Nagar police station demanding justice for the child.A massive manhunt was launched and the accused was identified as 35-year-old Ritesh Kumar from Bihar's Patna.Later in the day, based on CCTV footage and inputs from local residents, police traced the accused.“This morning in Vijayanagara area, within Ashok Nagar limits, the girl’s body was found in an abandoned shed. We identified the accused as Ritesh Kumar. He tried to flee, damaged the police vehicle, assaulted our officers, and pelted stones,” said Commissioner Kumar.“In self-defence, PSI Annapurna fired warning shots and then shot at the accused, injuring him in the leg and chest,” he added. The man was later declared dead.Defending police action, Karnataka government chief whip Saleem Ahmed said, “The commissioner has given me the information that the accused tried to hit the lady inspector and in self-defence, she had to fire at him... It is not a failure of law and order. Our police are competent enough to take action, so have they…”According to Hubballi-Dharwad Police Commissioner N Shashi Kumar, the girl’s mother had taken her along while working in nearby homes in the locality. An unidentified man took the girl away from one of these houses. After a frantic search, she was found unconscious in a bathroom inside a tin-roofed abandoned shed located directly opposite the house where she was last seen.“She was immediately shifted to the hospital where she was declared brought dead,” the Commissioner said.The victim’s family hails from Koppal district. Her mother works as a domestic help and beauty parlour assistant, while the father is a painter, officials said.While reports of sexual assault have emerged, the police have not confirmed it. “No information for now. Cause of death and whether there was any kind of assault will all be verified after medical examination,” Kumar said.Following the gruesome incident, angry residents gathered in large numbers at the Ashok Nagar police station demanding swift justice and answers. Police appealed to the public to maintain calm and let the investigation proceed.“The complaint is being taken from the girl’s parents. Necessary legal action is underway,” Kumar said.Authorities are still verifying key details. A post-mortem is expected to shed light on the cause of death and whether there was any sexual assault involved.The identity and background of the accused are also being investigated. “Once the identity is fully established, we’ll ascertain his whereabouts and any past records,” Kumar said.","The main accused wanted in connection with the kidnapping and murder of a 5-year-old girl in karnataka's hubballi, was killed in an encounter on sunday while allegedly attempting to flee from the cops.

'A truly pathetic state of affairs'

Home secretary assures all assistance

NEW DELHI: Amid unrest in West Bengal's Murshidabad , 12 more people were arrested in connection with violence, taking the total number to over 150. No new incident of violence has been reported yet after five companies of BSF were deployed in the Muslim-dominated district. Meanwhile, BJP claimed that over 400 Hindus have been ""forced to flee"" their houses following the tension.The move came after Calcutta high court on Saturday ordered the ""immediate"" deployment of Central forces in the area. IG South Bengal Frontier Karni Singh Shekhawat, said that BSF would coordinate with state police to restore peace in the region. He added that more forces would be added if needed.""We have to work along with them in this situation. The discussions were held on this only. We have sent our five companies to help the police. We are here to help the police, not for independent action. We will act according to the demands of the state police. We hope that peace will be restored here soon. If the police need more companies, we will provide them. BSF is ready for all situations,"" he said.The violence in West Bengal's Muslim-dominated Murshidabad erupted in the wake of the amended Waqf law. At least 3 people were killed and over 150 were arrested in connection with the violence. Meanwhile, raids were conducted at several places in West Bengal.Earlier on Friday, several vehicles were set ablaze and stones were hurled at security forces. Various districts, including Malda, Murshidabad, South 24 parganas were rocked by violence.BJP leader and West Bengal Assembly's Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari claimed that over 400 people have been ""forced to flee"" their houses following the violence.Further attacking Bengal's government, he said that ""appeasement politics"" on TMC has ""emboldened radical elements.""""More than 400 Hindus from Dhulian, Murshidabad driven by fear of religiously driven bigots were forced to flee across the river & take shelter at Par Lalpur High School, Deonapur-Sovapur GP, Baisnabnagar, Malda,"" Adhikari wrote in a post on X.The BJP leader also shared pictures and videos from the area, including interviews from displaced individuals. One man claimed his house had been set on fire while alleging that police personnel present at the scene failed to act and instead fled.""I urge the Central Paramilitary Forces deployed in the District, the State Police and the district administration to ensure the safe return of these displaced Hindus & protect their lives from this jihadist terror. Bengal is burning. The social fabric is torn. Enough is enough,"" his post read.""Religious persecution in Bengal is real. Appeasement politics of TMC has emboldened radical elements. Hindus are being hunted, our people are running for their lives in their own land! Shame on the State Govt for allowing this breakdown of law & order,"" he added.Adding to the rising dissent, Hyderabad MP and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Sunday announced a public protest meeting against the Act.“A protest public meeting is being organized by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board against the Waqf (Amendment) Act 2025 on 19th April from 7 pm to 10 pm in Hyderabad Darussalam. It will be presided over by the President of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, Khalid Saifullah Rahmani,” Owaisi said at a press conference.Owaisi said members from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh’s Muslim Personal Law Boards and key Muslim organizations would participate.“They will tell the public through their speeches that this Waqf (Amendment) Act is not in favour of the Waqf... We are also trying to talk to the members of the Waqf Committee, and if their schedule permits, they can also come and participate.”A senior police officer said on Sunday that prohibitory orders under section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) have been imposed in affected areas.He added that internet services were also suspended and security forces are checking vehicles on the main roads and patrolling the sensitive pockets.Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Saugata Roy said that chief minster Mamata Banerjee has called a meeting to pacify the Muslim community.Saugata Roy said, ""Mamata Banerjee is the leader of the people of Bengal. She knows how to run Bengal. There is no place for BJP here. People are unhappy over Waqf Amendment Bill, so the Chief Minister has called a meeting to pacify the Muslim community. People's sentiments are agitated over the Waqf Bill. The reaction was spontaneous.""BJP Lok Sabha MP from West Bengal, Jyotirmay Singh Mahato on Sunday wrote a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah requesting him to declare select border districts of West Bengal as 'disturbed areas' under AFSPA.Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind chief Mahmood Madani launched a scathing attack on the legislation, calling it a “politically motivated” move to enable land grabbing in the name of reform.Addressing a press conference in the national capital on Sunday, Madani alleged that the Act was not intended to strengthen the Waqf Boards, but to serve “vested interests.”“This is not an issue of Waqf but politics. In the name of Muslims, sometimes by abusing Muslims or by being the sympathisers of Muslims, this act (was implemented) with malicious intent,” Madani said.Madani claimed the government and its allies had created a false narrative to justify the amendment, portraying the previous Waqf Boards as operating without accountability.“BJP and its friends in the country and media friends told that the earlier Waqf Board was such that it could do anything... People of their choice were made in the government,” he said.He went on to accuse the government of facilitating real estate developers and land occupiers, particularly those eyeing prime properties.“You are trying to help the builders and land occupiers, so that they get the lands in prime locations... This act or amendment is not right for the country, society or Muslims. You are benefiting the occupiers,” Madani said.Amid tension, political storm erupted after BJP lashed out at state's chief minister Mamata Banerjee, saying that her government is ""incapable"" of handling the situation.""Let it be known that this was not an act of protest, rather a premeditated act of violence, an assault on Democracy and Governance by Jihadist forces who seek to spread chaos in order to assert their dominance and sow fear amongst other Communities of our Society,"" BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari said in a post on X.""Public property was destroyed, Government Officials felt threatened, and an atmosphere of fear and intimidation was created, all under the false guise of dissent. The silence of the Mamata Banerjee Government is deafening,"" he added.'A truly pathetic state of affairs'West Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar alleged that Mamata has handed over the state to ""Jihadis"" for vote bank politics.""The situation is very terrible. The special bench of the High Court has given the verdict, and we welcome it. The situation has become like this because of Mamata Banerjee's incompetence. The verdict of the High Court today is a big slap on Mamata Banerjee's cheek that she is not ready to rule the state. She is not eligible to rule the state,"" he said while speaking to ANI.On Sunday, BJP's Amit Malviya targetted Banerjee, saying that the morale of the West Bengal police has hit a new low, with senior officials struggling to maintain order amid a series of violent incidents and growing political pressure. In a post on X, Malviya claimed that during the recent violence in Murshidabad, West Bengal police officers refused to enter the riot-hit areas until the BSF arrived. He further alleged that the director general of police had to be physically present to coax officers into action.""The morale of the West Bengal Police is at an all-time low, following Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s repeated capitulation to rampaging Islamist mobs. In fact, they even refused to enter the riot-affected areas of Murshidabad until the BSF arrived. The Director General of Police had to be physically present to coax his own force into action. A similar situation occurred during the Sandeshkhali unrest, where the state’s top cop had to intervene personally—though the reasons were different then,"" Malviya said.""During the RG Kar protests, it was police officers who held press conferences and planted stories to shape the narrative. Every time Mamata Banerjee finds herself cornered, she uses the police as a political shield, as if no other TMC leader is willing—or perhaps even allowed—to defend her. The rest appear to be nothing more than clerks in Mamata Banerjee’s criminal empire,"" he added.Union home secretary Govind Mohan on Saturday assured all possible help amid violence in a video conference with the chief secretary and the director general of police of the state.Mohan asked the high officials to keep a close watch on other sensitive districts also and take adequate steps.He mentioned that the ""Centre is also closely monitoring the situation and assured the state all possible assistance including deployment of additional manpower, if necessary.""",The violence in west bengal's muslim-dominated murshidabad erupted in the wake of the amended waqf law.

Tahawwur Rana In India: Trump's Biggest Strike On Pak Terror, 26/11 Plotter To Face Justice Finally

Also read:

NEW DELHI: Worry seemed to flit across Tahawwur Rana’s face when he asked his legal counsels on Thursday night whether his trial would be over in a year or so and received “No” as a reply, sources said. They told him that just filing a chargesheet could consume a year, and that the entire trial, even a fast one, could take between five to 10 years.As he got a quick primer on the pace of the Indian legal system, Rana asked if he could plead the “Fifth”, to which his counsels said Indian laws also provide protection from “self-incrimination”, sources said. “Pleading the Fifth”, or invoking the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution, means refusing to answer questions or providing information that could incriminate oneself.Walking slowly in a brown jumpsuit with Crocs as footwear, wearing specta cles and a four-to-six-inch white beard, a fringe of white hair framing a balding scalp, Rana was produced before the special NIA court of special judge Chander Jit Singh in Patiala House Court at around 10.30pm on Thursday amid heavy security. His legal aid counsels (LACs) — advocates Piyush Sachdeva and Lakshya Dheer — were provided to him by Delhi State Legal Services Authority.Looking frail, tired, and jet-lagged, Rana displayed no other signs of anxiety during the court proceedings. However, the effects of age-related ailments were visible on the former Pakistan Army officer accused of a key role in the 26/ 11 Mumbai terror attacks. Rana suffers from various ailments, including abdominal, intestinal, and sinus cysts.According to sources, he came across as a “smart individual” who can strike up “casual conversations”. Rana was offered fruits by NIA personnel while waiting for court proceedings to begin, which he refused, but interacted “comfortably” with agency members. Sources said that Rana is being “taken good care of”. Govt and the agency want to make this case a “model one” so no one is going to take any chances, said sources.Rana’s major concern, apart from his claim that he is innocent and that extradition was not needed as he had already spent over a decade in jail and had been “acquitted” in the matter, was his medical care. On this, NIA assured the special judge that he would be provided all the medical care he needs. The question of “manhandling” also came up in the hearing, which was addressed by the court directing that Rana be medically examined every 48 hours.A US district court trial by jury had acquitted him on June 9, 2011 of conspiracy to provide material support to the Nov 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. The LACs appearing for Rana urged the court to provide him with a “writing instrument” so that he can prepare his defence.The hearing for his remand was over within 10-15 minutes at around 11pm on Thursday. However, the order was pronounced at around 2am Friday.The prosecution, led by senior advocate Dayan Krishnan and advocate Narender Mann, submitted before the court that Rana is the first accused to be arrested and has links with named terrorists and other accused persons in this case. The counsels appearing for NIA told the court that a detailed investigation is required, Rana has to be confronted with a lot of evidence, and his statements would lead to additional discoveries.The court granted NIA 18 days’ custody of Rana. The agency requested 20 days, expressing concern that Rana might orchestrate terror plots like 26/11 targeting additional Indian cities. The court stipulated several conditions, including permission to consult with his legal representative on alternate days. The court also specified that Rana could only use a soft-tip pen and must conduct meetings with his lawyer under NIA supervision and within hearing range.","Tahawwur rana was produced before the special nia court of special judge chander jit singh in patiala house court at around 10.30pm on thursday.

No, it was just a harmless prank. Yes, it was a serious breach of rules.

GURGAON: A video from OP Jindal University in Sonipat - featuring a girl emerging out of a suitcase like a magician's escape - went viral on social media, with many describing it as a boy's 'Romeo-and-Juliet' style attempt to smuggle his love into his hostel. The university said it was prank gone too far and was taking action against the students.Although the video - which surfaced Saturday - does not show any boy in it, sources at the university said one had indeed sneaked into the girls' hostel.It was not immediately clear if this was linked to the suitcase incident.According to Anjoo Mohun, director of communications at the university, the video shows a group of girl students moving their friend around the hostel in a large suitcase as part of a ""light-hearted"" joke.""This was a prank, entirely confined to the premises of the girls' hostel. The suitcase was carried into a public area within the hostel, where security personnel monitoring CCTV footage noticed suspicious activity and intervened. When they opened the suitcase, they found a girl inside,"" she said.With the video spreading far and wide - and attracting a volley of reactions - the university promised disciplinary action against every student involved in the 'prank'. On Saturday evening, the students had received show-cause notices, asking them to appear before a disciplinary committee by the end of this month.The university emphasised that student safety remained a top priority. ""We're treating the matter seriously. While no one was harmed, such actions can raise security concerns and have unintended consequences,"" it said in a statement.The university also urged people to refrain from sharing ""unverified information"" and respect the ""privacy and dignity"" of the students involved.But through the day, the video drew a mix of reactions on social media.Many were quick to criticise the strict restrictions that compel couples to resort to such extreme measures. ""The length that people need to go to just to get some private time with their loved ones in this country is so dehumanising,"" one user wrote.Others took a lighter approach. ""On the bright side, he carried her alive,"" one posted. Some could not resist poking fun at the risks involved.

No, stronger actions are needed Yes, it's the best approach

NEW DELHI: Amid rising political heat over the Murshidabad violence in West Bengal, RJD MP Manoj Kumar Jha hit out at the BJP for repeatedly invoking Hindu victimhood, saying the narrative had worn thin and that social harmony was a shared responsibility of both the Centre and the states.“Kitni jagah ye card kheloge, ghis chuka hai,” said Jha, responding to BJP allegations of ""state-sponsored, state-protected, and state-encouraged targeted violence against Hindus."" The BJP had blamed the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress government for the clashes during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act.Speaking to ANI, Jha added, “The time has come for PM Modi to break his silence. The country's social harmony is the responsibility of the Centre and all state governments... because if the country remains, only then there will be elections and parties would win and lose them.”The violence in Murshidabad has left three people dead and led to the arrest of 150 individuals. A special bench of the Calcutta High Court has ordered immediate deployment of central forces in the region. The matter will be heard again on April 17.On the ground, police forces have been deployed in Samserganj, Dhuliyan, and other sensitive zones. Protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act had turned violent, with reports of vandalised temples, demolished idols, and Hindu homes and shops being set ablaze.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla accused the Mamata government of appeasement. “Bengal is burning... Hindus are being forced to migrate, and idols in temples are being demolished. The saffron flag was pulled down. Mamata Banerjee should be ashamed,” he said, calling the incidents an affront to the legacy of Swami Vivekananda.In contrast, Manoj Jha urged for calm and restraint. “Whatever is happening is unfortunate. This should not happen. I will request everyone to have peaceful resistance. Let us follow the path shown by Gandhiji,” he said. Jha confirmed his party is a petitioner in the case, expressing hope that “the injustice done due to the misinterpretation of Article 26 will be addressed.”He added, “I believe that Mamata Banerjee-led TMC government will control this.”Meanwhile, a PIL filed by advocate Anish Mukherjee on behalf of Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari has sought central forces and an NIA probe.

The MP alleged repeated attacks on the Hindu community there.TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh termed the demand to clamp Afspa in four districts ""unconstitutional"".""We are receiving grave complaints that the masterminds (of the violence in Murshidabad) may have cross-border links.

The report was submitted to the cabinet on Friday. On Sunday, all cabinet ministers were delivered a copy to study and prepare for the April 17 meeting.Though the leaked report does not give the respective proportions in total population of the two dominant caste groups in Karnataka - Vokkaligas and Lingayats - it does propose quotas in different categories which the two rival caste groups are part of.The report says that under category III(A), which includes Vokkaligas and two other dominant communities, the population is placed at 73 lakh with a recommendation of a 7% reservation. Similarly, the population under category III (B), which comprises Veerashaiva-Lingayats and five other communities, is 81.3 lakh and the report recommends 8% quota. The total population of the state is pegged at 5.9 crore.As per the report's recommendations, the total reservation for all communities would increase to 73.5% (including 15% for SCs and 7.5% for STs) from the existing 50%, in line with SC capping guideline.Though the exact proportion of Lingayats and Vokkaligas in the population of modern-day Karnataka is not known, the two communities were estimated at 19% and 17%, respectively, on the basis of which the Chenappa Reddy commission for socio-economic survey had given its report in 1990. Based on that report, the then Deve Gowda govt in the state had recommended 4% reservations for Muslims.Even though the total Lingayat numbers are not known, industries minister and Lingayat politician M B Patil hinted at mismatch between ground realities and the survey findings, saying: ""It is nobody's fault that Lingayat numbers have fallen. Members of some Lingayat sub-castes have (in a fine slicing of sub-caste identity) declared themselves as Hindu Ganiga, Hindu Banajiga and Hindu Sadaras for the sake of (existing) 2A reservation benefits. If we take all of them into account and also Lingayats recorded under 3B, then their population crosses 1 crore. The cabinet meeting will discuss all these finer points.""Muslims are placed at 12.6% of the population in the survey conducted in 2015.The largest community in Karnataka, however, are the Scheduled Castes with a population of nearly 1.1 crore and 108 sub-castes within them.Responding to senior Congressman Shamanur Shivashankarappa's claim that the report was ""unscientific"", deputy CM D K Shivakumar was cryptic in his response: ""Everyone is trying to safeguard their communities. I will not stop them (as it's their democratic right to do so). On April 17, the cabinet will discuss the issue.""BJP targeted Congress govt for minority appeasement. ""This report reeks of CM dictating the numbers to census author H Kantharaju. If not, there is no way Muslims are declared the 'majority community',"" said LoP R Ashoka.",The report was submitted to the cabinet on friday.
