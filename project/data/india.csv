'Endured what happened to me but my sister ...

This vehement reaction came on the heels of Rohini's retirement from the political arena and ongoing family turmoil.

NEW DELHI: Tej Pratap Yadav on Monday again launched a strong attack on individuals within his family and RJD, accusing them of acting like “traitors” and warning that he would not accept any insult directed at his sister.His remarks come days after RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav ’s daughter Rohini Acharya announced her exit from politics and severed ties with the family, a move followed by three of her sisters reportedly leaving the Patna residence amid the escalating dispute.In a post on X, the Janshakti Tej Pratap wrote: “We will not tolerate any insult to our sister under any circumstances; the traitors will surely have to pay the price for this misconduct!”“The abuse that was done to our Rohini di by Jaichand, this incident has shaken my heart to the core. What happened to me, I have endured, but what happened to my sister — that insult is absolutely unacceptable under any circumstances. Listen, Jaichand, if you attack the family, the people of Bihar will never forgive you,” Tej Pratap added in his post.This marks the latest development in months of turmoil within the Yadav family, which saw Tej Pratap himself expelled from both the RJD and the family following a bitter dispute over his personal life.Earlier, on Sunday, following Rohini Acharya’s announcement, Tej Pratap shared an emotionally charged post on his party’s Instagram account, warning those he described as “traitors” and appealing directly to his father.“Yesterday’s incident has shaken me to the core. What happened to me — I endured it. But the insult done to my sister is absolutely unbearable under any circumstances. Listen, traitors— if you target our family, the people of Bihar will never forgive you. When the emotions of the people are wounded, the dust covering their judgment is blown away,” he wrote.He also accused them of influencing his brother Tejashwi’s political judgment.“These few faces have even clouded Tejashwi’s judgment. The consequences of this injustice will be extremely grave. Time’s reckoning is harsh,” he added.The JJP chief also urged Lalu Prasad Yadav to intervene: “Father, give just one signal… just one gesture, and the people of Bihar themselves will bury these traitors. This is not a fight of any political party — it is a fight for the family’s honour, for the dignity of daughters, and for the self-respect of Bihar.”The controversy comes in the wake of Rohini Acharya’s social-media post on Sunday in which she alleged humiliation, abuse and expulsion from her parental home.She claimed she was “disgraced, abused, and even hit” after questioning the leadership over RJD’s poor performance in the Assembly elections.Rohini had named responsible for the family rift, claiming their actions prompted her decision to quit politics and leave her parents’ home.","In a passionate outburst, tej pratap yadav took aim at family members and rjd associates whom he branded as 'betrayers' for disrespecting his sister, rohini acharya.

Telangana govt to send team to Saudi to coordinate relief

Eighteen members of a family were among at least 45 Umrah pilgrims from Hyderabad charred early Monday in a bus inferno triggered by a highway collision with a fuel tanker while travelling from Mecca to Medina in Saudi Arabia. Mohammed Shoeb, the lone pilgrim to survive, escaped because he was seated beside the driver when the bus burst into flames after ramming into the tanker around 1.30am (11pm IST). Both men broke through a window and jumped.Hyderabad police commissioner V C Sajjanar said the 46 passengers were part of a 54-member group that flew from the city to Saudi Arabia on Nov 9. They were to return on Nov 23 after visiting Islam's holiest site. ""Four members of the group hired a car to travel to Medina after completing Umrah rituals. Another four stayed back in Mecca,"" Sajjanar said.The victims include 22 women and 11 children. Shoeb, whose brother also travelled to Saudi Arabia for the pilgrimage but wasn't on the bus, remains in intensive care at Saudi German Hospital with injuries to his arms and legs.""I spoke to Shoeb. Going by what he said, some passengers were asleep during the crash.He was lucky to be in the cabin with the driver,"" his sibling, Mohammed Sameer, told TOI over phone.""It is unclear if the tanker hit the vehicle while it was moving or was stationary.”Sameer and his family landed in Jeddah three days after the rest of the pilgrims and are yet to finish their Mecca rituals. PM Modi condoled the deaths in a post on X. “Deeply saddened by the accident in Medinah involving Indian nationals. My thoughts are with the families who have lost their loved ones. I pray for the swift recovery of all those injured. Our embassy in Riyadh and consulate in Jeddah are providing all possible assistance,” he wrote.Telangana govt has decided to depute a team, led by its minorities welfare minister Mohammad Azharuddin, to Saudi Arabia to coordinate relief efforts. Announcing ex gratia of Rs 5 lakh each to the kin of those who died, the govt said it would help arrange the funerals of the deceased in Saudi in accordance with traditions. Two members of each affected family would be flown to Saudi, it said. “The bodies were charred beyond recognition. DNA tests are also likely to be conducted to identify the victims,” said Azharuddin, adding a control room had been set up at Haj House (numbers 79979 59754/99129 19545) to provide more information to families of victims. The minister reaffirmed the state govt, in coordination with the foreign ministry and Saudi authorities, was making all possible efforts to provide assistance, guidance, and necessary support to the families. Police and govt officials, who are in contact with authorities in Saudi, said the Al-Makkah Travels-owned bus was about 25km short of its destination when the fatal crash occurred.Saudi authorities have started investigating the circumstances that led to the accident. In a 2023 report, the UN pointed out that Saudi had a high road fatality rate compared to other high-income countries.

BENGALURU: Metro services on the Yellow Line were disrupted for over 30 minutes Monday morning after a group of passengers halted a train at RV Road station, demanding that BMRCL start operations at 5am on the newly opened corridor.The incident occurred at 6am, when 10-15 commuters allegedly stood between the doors of a departing train, preventing them from closing and allowing the train to leave the station.Based on a complaint from BMRCL, an FIR was registered against unidentified passengers for obstructing services. While operations on Purple and Green Lines begin around 4.30am Mondays, Yellow Line — connecting RV Road to Bommasandra — currently starts its first service at 6am.Officials said this mismatch left early officer-goers frustrated and airport-bound commuters waiting at RV Road station. When train ID02 arrived at 5.55am, a group of passengers is said to have confronted staff, questioning why the service hadn't commenced earlier. Despite explanations that Yellow Line services cannot operate before 6am due to limited availability of trainsets, passengers continued to argue.Instead of boarding, they stood between the coach doors, preventing them from closing each time the loco pilot attempted to start the train. This led to a cascading delay of nearly 35 minutes, affecting subsequent schedules and inconveniencing hundreds of passengers during early-morning rush.A senior official said BMRCL is currently operating Yellow Line with all available trainsets, leaving no spare rakes to be deployed for earlier services. ""Passengers disrupted operations, causing delays across multiple trains. We had to call police to resolve the situation,"" the official said.Later to make up for the disruption, BMRCL ran a short-loop service up to Silk Board.In an official release, the corporation warned that obstructing Metro operations is a punishable offence under Metro Railway (Operation and Maintenance) Act, 2002, and could attract imprisonment, fines, or both. ""Such actions compromise safety and inconvenience thousands,"" the statement read.It also highlighted recent improvements since Nov 1 — after adding the fifth trainset, Yellow Line start time was advanced from 6:30am to 6am, and peak-hour headway was reduced from 19 minutes to 15. More improvements are expected as additional trains are inducted into the service, it said.","Metro services on the yellow line were disrupted for over 30 minutes monday morning.

(With inputs from Manoj Badgeri, Richa Pinto, and B B Nayak)

MUMBAI: A day after the damage to a gas pipeline in Chembur, several Mumbaikars faced the inconvenience of not getting autos, taxis, private cabs, and school buses on Monday as operations of several CNG refuelling stations in MMR remained shut.The situation may worsen on Tuesday as 44% of the BEST bus fleet running on CNG could be off the roads too, thereby crippling the city's road lifeline. This is apart from several autos and taxis being unavailable, said transportation sources. The crisis also affected owners of the more than 500,000 private CNG cars in the region.An MGL spokesperson said domestic PNG (cooking gas) would not be impacted though. ""Currently, out of MGL's total 389 gas stations, 225 are operating. The rectification work is in progress, and the restoration of gas supply is expected by Tuesday noon,"" she added.BEST operated its fleet of CNG buses on Monday as they refuelled at Anik depot on Sunday night, but there was no more fuel left for buses on Monday night, an official said. Most aggregator cabs such as Ola and Uber had the option to switch to dual fuel and run on petrol, but riders were impacted by surge fares as high as 2x in many areas.The CNG crisis began Sunday afternoon after ""third-party damage"" to the gas pipeline of GAIL India Ltd at RCF terminal, Chembur, resulting in the supply to Mahanagar Gas Ltd's (MGL) station in Wadala being disconnected.School Bus Owners' Association president Anil Garg said 2,000 school buses in MMR ply on CNG and they were off the roads, due to which students suffered. Several school buses have switched from diesel to CNG in recent years. Andheri resident Suheil Merchant said, ""My wife had a harrowing time dropping my little one to the class, as she had to walk back from Vile Parle West to Andheri West. The school van operator also cancelled today's pick-up and drop for the afternoon school. """"Share autos operating for Bandra-Kurla Complex from Kurla and Bandra stations were fleecing us with exorbitant fares of Rs 50-60 per passenger, citing the CNG crisis,"" said Vijay Bhandari, an office-goer. Autos and taxis, which were plying, demanded excess fares while those outside pumps waited in 1-2 km long queues with other CNG vehicles, with drivers uncertain when refuelling would resume. ""I have been waiting since 5:30am outside a Bhandup pump and it is 1pm, and there is so much confusion, with nobody telling us the timeline when services will restart,"" said Ashwin Surve, an auto driver.Aditi Chatterjee from Chembur said she was among several commuters unable to get an auto on Monday, and she walked 1.5km from where she got public transport. In the absence of autos, the BEST buses ran packed, but many were unable to catch these buses and people walked. ""I stay 7km away from the station and depend on autos for travel. Tuesday morning will be painful with no autos,"" said Mukul Tiwari, a Thane resident.Petrol Dealers' Association president Chetan Modi said on Sunday, gas supply was restored at 70% of pumps around 9-10pm. ""We had a long queue outside our pump after which the police were called and the supply was stopped at midnight. We resumed supply in the morning for some time, but the pressure of gas was low and had to shut completely,"" he said.Mumbai Rickshawmen's Union president Thampy Kurien said the MGL should have arranged for alternate gas supply such as one from Mahape so that in such a crisis situation, they can switch to the second line and keep autos, taxis, and other vehicles running across the city. ""We had demanded this through our petitions in the past."" He added that there was a daily loss in earnings of Rs 400 to Rs 1,500 per driver for autos-taxis, with the city having nearly 20,000 taxis and 300,000 autos in Greater Mumbai alone.Mumbai Autorickshawmen's Union leader Shashank Rao said the crisis affected peak hour commuters the most and the issue may worsen if it prolongs on Tuesday, and may lead to law and order problems outside pumps. Police were deployed in a few areas to keep check at pumps.In Thane, as only one of the four MGL-operated pumps in the city at Khopat was operating, many motorists queued up with few complaining of having waited for several hours with no luck. The Thane municipal transport fleet that has around 25-30% fleet operating on CNG said the situation would be manageable till Tuesday morning.Navi Mumbai faced a major disruption in CNG supply, causing significant inconvenience for motorists over the past two days. Satyam Upadhyay, a cab operator from Ghansoli, said he was unable to work since Sunday while monitoring news about supply restoration. The shortage resulted in serpentine queues at filling stations across the city, leaving many drivers without business.","Cng crisis disrupts public transport, causes commuter inconvenience in mumbai.

The Culmination

The painful truths

Investigative systems can fail, especially when constrained by corruption, negligence, or lack of urgency.

Evidence matters, but how it's collected — and whether due process is followed — can make or break a case.

Confession is a double-edged sword: powerful, but only if obtained fairly and documented properly.





NOIDA/NEW DELHI: For years, the narrow lanes of Nithari whispered the same story: children vanished, one after another, swallowed by a darkness no one could name.Inside D-5, where life seemed ordinary from the outside, investigators later uncovered fragments of a nightmare scattered through drains, courtyards and rooms that refused to give up their truth.Two decades on, Nithari remains less a crime scene and more a wound — a place where every unanswered question still walks the streets.The Nithari case remains one of country's most chilling and controversial serial-killing episodes. It centers around Bungalow D-5 in Nithari village, Noida and involves two men — the homeowner, Moninder Singh Pandher and his domestic helper, Surinder Koli The macabre tale that unfolded over years involved skeletal remains in drains, allegations of rape, murder, necrophilia, and organ trading — and a deeply flawed investigation that has haunted the judicial process for nearly two decades.The nightmare began in May 2006, when Nand Lal , father of a 22-year-old woman named Payal (also known as Deepika), reported her missing.Payal had visited Pandher’s bungalow D-5 in Sector 31, Nithari, allegedly to talk about a job for her brother — but she never returned.It was later reported that Koli had called her from a public phone booth.Despite the serious nature of the disappearance, the police response was strikingly delayed.According to a former investigator (then sub-inspector, later DSP), no FIR was registered for months.It was only after a court application under Section 156(3) of the CrPC, filed by Nand Lal, that an FIR was formally lodged on October 7, 2006 — nearly five months after Payal vanished.Things took a horrifying turn on December 29, 2006, when investigators discovered eight skeletal remains in a roadside drain next to the D-5 bungalow.This grim find, lead to the arrest of both Koli and Pandher. Within days, more bone fragments were unearthed in and around the drainage system.The discovery shook the nation and exposed the full extent of what had been a series of missing persons — children and young women — in and around Nithari.The initial investigation by the Uttar Pradesh Police came under criticism almost immediately. According to the first investigator, crucial delays had allowed the case to spiral: The FIR was filed only after months of pressure, and formal search operations began six months too late.These early lapses, he said, sowed the seeds of deeper problems.By January 10, 2007, due to mounting public outrage and the scale of the horror, the case was handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Within days, CBI teams conducted intensive searches around the bungalow and adjoining areas, recovering more human remains — skulls, bone pieces and dismembered body parts.The sheer scale of recovered remains made it difficult even for the investigators to determine how many victims there might have been.In the early months of the investigation, charge sheets were filed in 16 cases, spanning accusations of murder, rape, abduction, criminal conspiracy, destruction of evidence and more.On March 1, 2007, Koli made a highly detailed recorded confession.He reportedly admitted to murdering six children and one woman. He described luring them into the bungalow, strangling them, sexually abusing the bodies, dismembering them and discarding the remains in drains.He also made claims of cannibalism, stating that he sometimes cooked and ate flesh from the victims.The case proceeded in a special CBI court in Ghaziabad, and on February 13, 2009, both Koli and Pandher were sentenced to death in the first case.The trial court would go on to deliver verdicts over many years, across multiple hearings, more than 2,000 hearings were held during this prolonged trial.Koli was eventually convicted in 13 cases by the trial court and awarded death sentences in all, though one of these was commuted to life imprisonment.In a later case (May 2022), a special CBI court awarded him another death sentence for the rape and murder of a woman.While the trial court’s judgments were gruesome and seemed to close the case, the story was far from over.On September 11, 2009, the Allahabad high court delivered a big verdict: While upholding Koli’s death sentence, it acquitted Pandher in at least one prominent case, citing “no evidence” against him.Over time, Koli’s legal team mounted a fierce appeal. On October 16, 2023, in a landmark decision, the Allahabad high court acquitted Koli in 12 of the death-sentence cases and Pandher in two, overturning the trial court’s verdicts.The court did not mince words: It stated that the investigation had been botched up and that “basic norms of collecting evidence were brazenly violated.”A particularly scathing point in the high court’s judgment was the failure to probe possible organ trade — an angle raised by a high-level committee from the Ministry of Women and Child Development.Investigators, the court said, “opted for the easy course” by pinning blame on Koli and demonising him, instead of exploring deeper and more alarming conspiracies.The court also questioned the credibility of Koli’s confession. It noted procedural irregularities: the confession was allegedly recorded 60 days into police remand, yet there was no medical examination or independent witness.Moreover, the court highlighted contradictions in prosecution testimony about where and when the confession was made.Recovery of skeletal remains, according to the court, came from a drain outside the boundaries of Pandher’s house — not from inside, as had often been claimed.Ultimately, the court declared that the guilt of Koli and Pandher had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, particularly because the case rested largely on circumstantial evidence.The judgment drew sharp criticism from victim families, who saw it as a deep betrayal after nearly two decades of pursuing justice.Following the high court’s 2023 acquittal, Moninder Singh Pandher was released from Luksar Jail on October 20, 2023, after spending 14 years behind bars.Surinder Koli, meanwhile, was not immediately freed — he continued to serve a life sentence in a separate conviction.But his legal fight was not over.In July 2025, the Supreme Court upheld the Allahabad HC’s acquittal of Koli in the 12 previously overturned cases. The apex court ruled that police lapses had rendered crucial evidence inadmissible.Then, on November 11, 2025, in a decisive moment, the Supreme Court accepted Koli’s curative plea (his last judicial recourse), acquitted him in the final pending case (Rimpa Haldar case) and ordered his immediate release.The man once dubbed the “Nithari killer” has now been acquitted in all major Nithari murder cases.When word of his acquittal reached his barrack, Koli had remained seated for some time, staring at the floor. Then a faint smile crossed his face. “He was relaxed, and there was a smile on his face,” a senior jail official told TOI.While Koli did give a detailed confession, the courts later scrutinised the conditions of its recording, It came long into police custody, without independent witnesses, and with no medical examination — casting shadows on its voluntariness and authenticity.Perhaps most damning was the court’s assertion that organ trade – a horrifying, but plausible, motive – was not properly probed.The investigation, according to the HC, seemed to choose the less difficult path of blaming a single man rather than confronting possible organised crime.One sacked officer, Simranjeet Kaur was arrested by the CBI in 2007 for allegedly framing false records to protect Pandher and Koli, having received payments.The mysterious death of a key witness, Jatin Sarkar, whose daughter was among the missing. His body was later found in a pond in Bengal.Parents of missing children watched as time passed with no clear answers. The high court’s 2023 acquittals were met with “dejection” by many, signaling that legal closure did not equal emotional closure.The community around Nithari, once traumatised by the gruesome revelations, still remembers the D-5 bungalow as a somber landmark.The Supreme Court’s acquittal in the 13th, and final, case against Koli left the families devastated.A 63-year-old Jhabbu Lal and his wife Sunita (60) continued seeking justice for their daughter Jyoti — one of the children who went missing in 2006 and was later found among the Nithari victims.“I had six children, and the fifth was Jyoti. She went missing in 2006,” Lal recalled, his voice shaking. “Her body was later found in the drain outside house number D5 (Moninder Pandher's bungalow where Koli worked).”Lal spent decades fighting in courts, selling valuables and even a house in Sangam Vihar, Delhi, to fund the case.Lal said, “If he didn’t commit the crime, then who did? If he is freed, that means someone else killed our children. Why was Koli kept behind bars for so many years?”Sunita Lal added, “Even after all these years, the pain hasn’t faded. Every time I pass that bungalow, it feels like I’m standing at the same place where my world ended. We never got our child back — only the memories and a lifetime of waiting for justice.”Another mother of a deceased said ""Moninder (Moninder Singh Pandher) and Surinder Koli, killed so many children. But the case is not being done anything about. Who is guilty now? Was there a ghost in that house which killed all children? They used to kill children and indulge in organ trafficking. Now they say that they are innocent. Law is letting them go; God won't.""When the Supreme Court finally granted his curative petition in November 2025 and ordered his immediate release, it marked the end of a long, fraught journey.The ruling underscored deep flaws in the original investigation: procedural lapses, contested confessions and weak evidence.Moninder Pandher, too, walked free earlier when the high court acquitted him.It was noted that during his release in October 2023, Pandher was frail, battling health issues including tuberculosis.The bungalow D-5, once infamous, now lies overgrown and decaying — a ghostly testament to the violence that took place there.Even when courts finally render a verdict, emotional justice may remain elusive for victims and their families.The Nithari killings case, is more than a crime story; it is a mirror to systemic failures, a cautionary tale about investigative hubris, and a study in how the quest for justice can stretch over decades.The courtroom battles — convictions, acquittals and final release — have reshaped public memory of D-5 bungalow.But the wounds remain: for the families who lost children, for a village scarred by horror, and for a nation forced to reckon with how easily its systems can be outpaced by darkness.","Two decades on, nithari remains less a crime scene and more a wound. Every unanswered question still walks the streets. Confession is a double-edged sword: powerful but only if obtained fairly and documented properly. Moninder singh pandher and his domestic helper, surinder koli, were sentenced to death in the first case.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125365659,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-46652,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

""I have no family..."" Rohini Acharya Cuts Ties With Lalu Clan, Exits Politics Post-RJD Defeat

Insult meted out to my sister is intolerable: Tej Pratap

PATNA/NEW DELHI: RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad's daughter Rohini Acharya's outburst at her brother Tejashwi Yadav and his close associates for ""abusing"" and ""throwing"" her out of home is snowballing into a full-blown family feud and hints at increasing internal rumblings over the decisions of the party's anointed heir after its bid for office unravelled spectacularly in the assembly polls.As she dropped another bombshell on Sunday by saying she was dissed for donating her ""dirty kidney"" to Lalu and was accused of extracting crores of rupees and a Lok Sabha ticket, three of her sisters - Ragini, Chanda and Rajlakshmi - left their parents' Patna residence.Their brother Tej Pratap Yadav, disowned by his father and ousted from the party last year, spoke up against Rohini's ""humiliation"".Lalu, his younger son and political heir Tejashwi, and other family members have maintained silence, an indication of the division and conflicted emotions within. The party too has kept mum.Some party leaders suggested that differences among the siblings have long been simmering as Tejashwi took firmer control of the party and leaned on a set of advisers loyal to him to run its affairs. That arrangement has come up for questioning.But the Bihar assembly poll debacle has opened up this style of functioning to questioning. Rohini said everybody is wondering what fate has befallen RJD, a party that governed Bihar between 1990 and 2005.Tej Pratap said in a social media post, ""Yesterday's incident has shaken me. But the insult meted out to my sister is intolerable.""I tolerated whatever happened to me but her humiliation cannot be tolerated under any condition... The consequence of this injustice will be very dire.""He accused 'Jaichands' (betrayers), widely believed to be a reference to a couple of Tejashwi's close associates, including Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Yadav, of targeting the Yadav family. Appealing to Lalu, he said, ""Just one nod, and the people of Bihar will bury these Jaichands themselves. This fight is not for any party; it is for the honour of the family, the dignity of the daughter, and the self-respect of Bihar.""As the family fallout played out, TV footage showed three more daughters of Lalu's reaching Patna airport with their children to catch a flight, reportedly for Delhi. None of them spoke to the media. Incidentally, their departure came hours after Rohini advised women to ""look after your in-laws and families and take care of your children"" rather than parents.""I would tell all married women never to do anything to save their parents, and if they have a brother, they should ask him to donate his own kidney or ask his Haryanavi friend to do so,"" she said in an emotional post. She said she had committed a blunder by not obtaining permission from her husband and in-laws and not thinking about the future of her three children before donating a kidney to her father.Earlier, she alleged she was humiliated and abused, and a slipper was lifted to hit her. She said her parents, Lalu and Rabri Devi, both former CMs, were crying and blamed Sanjay Yadav and Rameez Nemat Khan, who hails from Uttar Pradesh and is said to be Tejashwi's friend, for her ""fate"".She named her brother too but directed most of her anger at his two associates.The developments followed RJD's disastrous performance in the just-held assembly elections in Bihar, in which the party could win only 25 seats after contesting 143. Tejashwi was officially projected as MGB's chief ministerial candidate.Meanwhile, the JD(U) asked Lalu to explain the developments and act. ""She is the daughter of entire Bihar, then why are you silent, Lalu ji... Please break your silence,"" JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said.","Rohini acharya's outburst at her brother tejashwi yadav is snowballing into a full-blown family feud. Three of her sisters - ragini, chanda and rajlakshmi - left their parents' patna residence. Tej pratap yadav, disowned by his father and ousted from the party last year, spoke up against rohini's ""humiliation"" ""please break your silence,"" jd(u) spokesperson neeraj kumar said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125375382,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1080997,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

LUCKNOW/KANPUR: Investigators are racing to close the arc of a Jaish-e-Mohammed project they said was years in the making - one that turned a campus doctor into ""Madam Surgeon"" of a cross-border terrorist blueprint.The alleged architect linking these threads is 43-year-old Dr Shaheen Shahid - ""Madam Surgeon"" in the underground lexicon of the JeM module of medics accused of the Nov 10 New Delhi car blast and preparing coordinated terrorist strikes on six cities, investigators said.Investigators described Shaheen, arrested in Faridabad, as a key asset. Seized digital evidence, handwritten diaries and planning notes - now central to the case - describe a plan for a Dec 6 strike aimed at ""avenging"" the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition The papers outline ""D-6 Mission"", target lists, recruitment pitches, fund movements and secure communication protocols. Investigators also identified roles assigned to Kashmiri doctors Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie and Umar Un Nabi, alongside Shaheen, who allegedly joined a deeper JeM-backed structure in 2021.The probe has allegedly uncovered an Rs 20-lakh hawala channel routed through a JeM handler for operational use by Umar, Muzammil and Shaheen - money suspected to have funded recruitment, safe houses, secure phones and reconnaissance.Agencies have begun an audit of Shaheen's financial footprint, scrutinising every high-value transfer, cash withdrawal and unexplained deposit across her three Kanpur accounts, two Lucknow accounts and two Delhi accounts. The hunt: any tie to the foreign-funded module.Teams are also reconstructing Shaheen's movements in Kanpur, especially at GSVM Medical College, where she worked until her unexplained disappearance. Officials are collecting entry logs, duty rosters, visitor lists and details of where she stayed between Jan and Oct 2025. Colleagues remembered a soft-spoken doctor from Lucknow who rarely took leave, brought her young child to duty because there was ""no one at home"", and avoided speaking about her divorce. She lived in an L-Block campus residence, maintained cordial ties with women co-workers, and vanished in Dec 2013 after handing over HOD responsibilities, promising to return by Jan 4, 2014. She never did. For nearly a year, official letters went unanswered. In 2016, two staffers sent to her registered address found it incorrect. She was formally dismissed in 2021.Interrogations showed that in March 2022, the module travelled to Turkiye for a meeting with ISI handler Abu Ukasha, allegedly securing a ""green signal"" for the Dec 6 plan. The timeline under reconstruction spans 2010 ideological drift, 2015-16 induction into JeM circles, and structured planning from 2021 as part of a project backed by Pakistan-based handlers.A former GSVM staffer recalled her transformation beginning around 2010 after contact with an Indian-origin doctor abroad who shared ideological videos and literature. She soon adopted new attire, including a hijab, and repeatedly spoke of relocating overseas.According to officials, her ideological shift was unmistakable by 2021. When confronted by a relative about abandoning her marriage, job and family, she allegedly said: ""I have lived enough for myself. Now, it's time to repay the debt of my community.""","Investigators describe dr shaheen shahid, arrested in faridabad, as a key asset.

NIA Arrests Alleged Aide Of ‘Suicide Bomber’ Umar Nabi In Delhi Terror Attack

NIA press release

The probe

NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday arrested another key associate of the terrorist involved in the car blast near Red Fort in New Delhi on November 10.""Active co-conspirator"" Jasir Bilal Wani alias Danish, a Kashmir resident, was arrested from Srinagar in Jammu & Kashmir by an NIA team that was in the Valley in the case, news agency ANI reported citing NIA.The Hyundai i20 car used in the blast near the Red Fort metro station parking was driven by Mohammad Umar, a Kashmiri doctor suspected to be behind the deadly explosion.The anti-terror agency's probe revealed that Jasir had allegedly provided ""technical support for carrying out terror attacks by modifying drones and attempting to make rockets ahead of the deadly car bomb blast, which killed 15 persons and left 32 persons injured"".Also read: Army chief warns after Delhi blast; calls Operation Sindoor a 'trailer' Investigators probing the November 10 blast reconstructed a minute-by-minute trail of suicide bomber Umar Un Nabi, mapping his movements across Faridabad, Nuh and Delhi through over 1,300 CCTV cameras.The compiled “Electronic Route” shows Umar’s white i20 passing through some of the most sensitive zones in the national capital in the hours leading up to the explosion.On Sunday, the NIA said it had arrested another aide of the suicide bomber Umer un Nabi for allegedly facilitating the purchase of the car in Delhi and conspiring with the bomber to carry out the terror attack.Amir Rashid Ali, a resident of Samboora, Pampore in J&K and in whose name the car involved in the attack was registered, was arrested from Delhi by the NIA, which had launched a massive search operation after taking over the case from Delhi Police.The NIA has examined 73 witnesses, including those injured in the blast, and continues to coordinate with Delhi Police, J&K Police, Haryana Police, UP Police and other agencies to trace the wider network behind the attack.Also read: Delhi bomber aide Amir Rashid Ali’s lawyer says he admitted ownership of Hyundai i20 used in Red Fort blast At the Red Fort blast site, investigators recovered three 9mm cartridges, two live and one empty, raising questions about their origin, as such ammunition is prohibited for civilian use.Meanwhile, the agency has reportedly uncovered online chats used by the module to influence and radicalise more youths, including women.With Ali’s arrest, the NIA believes it is inching closer to piecing together the conspiracy behind the rare suicide bombing attempt in the heart of the national capital.","""active co-conspirator"" jasir bilal wani alias danish was arrested from srinagar in jammu & kashmir.

How it unfolded



In one of Karnataka’s biggest-ever “digital arrest” scams, a 57-year-old Bengaluru woman was duped of nearly Rs 32 crore over six months.The software engineer from Indiranagar told investigators she remained trapped in the elaborate fraud until the scammers finally issued her a so-called “clearance letter.”Posing as CBI officers, the fraudsters reportedly placed her under a so-called “digital arrest,” keeping her under constant Skype surveillance. Using threats of immediate arrest, they pressured her into revealing her financial information and making 187 bank transfers.""In total, through 187 transactions, I stand deprived of a total amount of approximately Rs 31.83 crores, which were deposited by me,"" the woman was quoted as saying by PTI.The fraud began on September 15, 2024, when the victim received a call from someone claiming to be a DHL Andheri representative. She was told that a parcel booked in her name contained credit cards, passports, and MDMA, and that her identity had been misused.Before she could respond, the call was switched to individuals posing as CBI officers, who warned her that “all evidence is against you” and threatened immediate arrest.The impostors instructed her not to approach the police, claiming criminals were watching her home. Fearing for her family’s safety and her son’s upcoming wedding, she complied. She was told to install two Skype IDs and remain in constant video surveillance.A man identifying himself as Mohit Handa monitored her for two days, after which another impersonator, Rahul Yadav, kept watch for a week. A third man, Pradeep Singh, posed as a senior CBI officer and pressured her to “prove her innocence.”In her complaint, the woman said the group seemed to know her phone activity and location, which intensified her fear. They directed her to verify all her assets with the Financial Intelligence Unit of the RBI and showed forged documents to make the process appear legitimate.From September 24 to October 22, she shared her financial details and transferred significant amounts of money. Between October 24 and November 3, she deposited what she was told was a surety amount of Rs 2 crore, followed by additional transfers for supposed “taxes.” She was promised a clearance letter before her son’s engagement on December 6, as cited by PTI.On December 1, the scammers finally sent her a fake clearance letter, allowing the engagement to proceed. However, the psychological strain took a toll, and she became seriously ill shortly afterward, requiring a month of medical treatment.After December, the scammers continued to demand “processing charges,” repeatedly postponing the promised refunds, first to February, then to March. All communication abruptly stopped on March 26, 2025.The woman, still recovering and unwilling to disrupt her son’s wedding, waited until after the ceremony in June to file a formal complaint. She has now urged authorities to conduct a full investigation into the fraud.",The 57-year-old bengaluru woman was duped of nearly rs 32 crore over six months.

"EC orders 'Special Revision' of Assam voter list, final roll in Feb; how it differs from SIR",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-orders-special-revision-of-assam-voter-list-final-roll-in-feb-how-it-differs-from-sir/articleshow/125388067.cms,"File photo for representative purposes only.

How is Special Revision different from SIR?

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Monday ordered a ""Special Revision"" of electoral rolls in Assam, with the final voter list scheduled for publication on February 10, 2026. In its instructions to the state’s chief electoral officer, the poll panel said January 1, 2026 would be the qualifying date for the revision exercise.Officials said the Special Revision falls between the annual special summary revision and the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in terms of scale and intensity.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma welcomed the Election Commission’s decision and assured full cooperation from the state administration.""The Govt of Assam welcomes the Election Commission of India 's decision to undertake a Special Revision of the electoral rolls with 01.01.2026 as the qualifying date,"" he posted on X. ""This will help ensure clean, updated and accurate electoral rolls for all eligible citizens. Assam will extend full cooperation to the @ECISVEEP to complete the revision in a transparent and time-bound manner,"" he added.According to officials, the Special Revision stands somewhere between the annual special summary revision and the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls.A Special Revision is a focused exercise aimed at updating and correcting the rolls without undertaking a full-scale enumeration.It is designed to strengthen accuracy and address gaps in the list in a structured but moderate manner.A Special Intensive Revision, however, is a far more rigorous and exhaustive process. It involves deeper verification, multiple checks, intensive field work and a higher degree of scrutiny, usually deployed when major corrections or cleansing of the rolls are required.The Special Revision ordered for Assam is therefore more extensive than a routine summary revision but not as demanding as a full SIR.""It is in a way an upgrade of special summary revision... instead of enumeration forms, booth-level officers will verify electors on a pre-filled register,"" a senior functionary explained.According to the schedule, door-to-door verification will be carried out from November 22 to December 20. The integrated draft electoral roll will be published on December 27, and the final roll on February 10 next year.For field verification, booth level officers (BLOs) will be issued a pre-filled register containing the details of existing electors in their respective parts for house-to-house verification. Each household will serve as the basic unit for confirming or correcting voter details through direct interaction with residents or the head of the family.The poll panel clarified that the details of D-Voters (doubtful voters) will not be included in the BLO register as no verification is required in their case. D-Voters are individuals flagged for lacking valid citizenship documents under the Foreigners Act, 1946, and are identified through special tribunals.Although they do not receive voter cards, their particulars, such as name, age and photograph, will continue to be carried forward to the draft electoral roll without alteration. Any change, including removal, can only be made “upon receipt of an order from the competent Foreigners' Tribunal or an appropriate court of law”, the Commission emphasised.Last month, the EC ordered SIR for Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Puducherry, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and Lakshadweep. Among these, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala and West Bengal are set for elections in 2026. Elections in Assam are also due next year.Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar recently said, ""A special order will be issued by the Election Commission to hold SIR in Assam."" He added that ""Under the Citizenship Act, there are separate provisions for citizenship in Assam.

"Bihar elections: Smallest member of opposition bloc, but with victory under its belt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-elections-smallest-member-of-opposition-bloc-but-with-victory-under-its-belt/articleshow/125374479.cms,"Bihar Assembly Poll Results: NDA Touches 200-Seat Lead, Congress Intensifies SIR, Vote Chori Attacks

NEW DELHI: The smallest member of Mahagathbandhan in Bihar has made its presence felt in an otherwise trainwreck of an election for the opposition. In a state crowded with sub-regional satraps who are identified with their castes, I P Gupta of Indian Inclusive Party has come into the limelight by successfully mobilising members of castes that have long been on the margins.Gupta (55) won from Saharsa by defeating his BJP rival by over 2,000 votes, marking a successful electoral debut for his party which had contested three seats as an MGB constituent.It was an outcome that eluded better-known parties helmed by much bigger names. Jan Suraaj Party of Prashant Kishor and Vikashsheel Insaan Party of Mukesh Sahani, the latter an RJD ally like Gupta, are two such examples. While Kishor fielded candidates in over 235 seats, VIP contested 12. Both parties drew a blank.Gupta quit Congress in 2023 to champion the cause of Tanti-Tatwa, which falls under Extremely Backward Classes and is estimated to be 1-2% of the population, and pushed for a separate quota for them along with members of the Paan community. He blamed the state's NDA govt for the Supreme Court verdict that had overturned the move to grant SC quota to Tanti-Tatwa (historically weavers) and put the community back in the EBC category.He showed a knack for mobilisation by organising a successful rally in Patna's huge Gandhi Maidan in April, coming to the notice of parties of all hues in the election year. He said he was contacted by formations from across the political spectrum, from NDA to AIMIM and MGB, before he reached a deal with the opposition alliance. He held meetings with Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi Yadav and accused NDA of trying to sabotage his politics while holding talks with him.An engineer who ran a business before plunging into politics, Gupta's stock is likely to rise in a state where mobilisation along caste lines is central to political shifts.","I p gupta of indian inclusive party has come into the limelight by successfully mobilising members of castes that have long been on the margins.

‘Abnormal’: Left’s Dipankar Bhattacharya on Bihar poll result; claims ‘three experiments’ aided NDA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/abnormal-lefts-dipankar-bhattacharya-on-bihar-poll-result-claims-three-experiments-aided-nda/articleshow/125364532.cms,"CPI (ML) Liberation General Secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya (centre)

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya on Sunday termed the Bihar assembly election outcome “abnormal,” claiming it was shaped by three “experiments.""According to him, these included the transfer of Rs 10,000 to women under the Mahila Rojgar Yojana, the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, and the transfer of land to a ""corporate house"" at a “throwaway price.”“The poll dates were not announced until all the targeted welfare schemes of the government, including the provision of Rs 10,000 for women, materialised. This is an unprecedented and unique experiment in India’s electoral history,” Bhattacharya told reporters in Patna, two days after the results were declared.The CPI(ML)L, a constituent of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-led Mahagathbandhan, won just two of the 20 seats it contested — a sharp fall from the 12 out of 19 it secured in 2020. Overall, the three Left parties in the alliance won only three of 33 seats this time, compared to 16 out of 29 in the previous election.Speaking on SIR, Bhattacharya said the deletion of 65 lakh voters and the later addition of 3.5–4 lakh names before the polls had a ""significant impact"" on the result.He added that the third issue — the land transfer — had been raised by the opposition but failed to resonate with the voters, cautioning that it would “normalise the corporatisation of Bihar’s resources.”“From November 18 to 24, our candidates and party workers will go among the people as part of a feedback and public outreach exercise. We need to stop these experiments; otherwise, there will be no level-playing field in politics,” the Left leader stated.The Bihar assembly elections were held on November 6 and 11, covering 121 and 122 constituencies respectively.The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) secured a sweeping victory, winning 202 of the 243 seats. The Mahagathbandhan managed just 35 seats. In 2020, the NDA and the opposition bloc had won 125 and 110 seats respectively.","The bihar assembly elections were held on november 6 and 11, covering 121 and 122 constituencies respectively.

NDA Sweeps Bihar, Nitish Kumar Prepares for 10th CM Oath; A Look Back at ‘Sushasan Babu’s’ Journey

NEW DELHI: Nitish Kumar submitted his resignation as Bihar chief minister to governor Arif Mohammad Khan on Monday, marking the formal end of the outgoing NDA government.Before this, the government’s final cabinet meeting “authorised” Kumar to recommend dissolution of the assembly. The 10-minute meeting, chaired by him, unanimously passed the resolution, official sources said.Even as the current term concluded, the shape of the next government has become clearer. JD(U) president Nitish Kumar will take oath as chief minister for the 10th time on Thursday, November 20, a senior party leader told TOI. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to attend the ceremony, and at least one deputy chief minister is expected to be named.Talks among alliance partners have also settled the formula for cabinet berths. Along with the JD(U) and the BJP, smaller allies — the Chirag Paswan-led LJP (RV), the Manjhi-led HAM-S and the Upendra Kushwaha-led RLM — will be part of the new government.“The LJP (RV) is likely to get three berths in the new state cabinet while the HAM-S and RLM one berth each.
