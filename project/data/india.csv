Red Fort blast 'heinous terror incident': Centre,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/red-fort-blast-heinous-terror-incident-centre/articleshow/125288755.cms,"How Kashmir’s Jaish Posters Led To Delhi’s Red Fort Blast And Exposed A Nationwide Terror Network

NEW DELHI: The Union cabinet on Wednesday described Monday's car blast near Red Fort an act of ""terror"" in a description that signalled acknowledgement of the terrorists' plan to cause large-scale mayhem by striking multiple targets.""The country has witnessed a heinous terror incident, perpetrated by anti-national forces, through a car explosion near Red Fort on the evening of Nov 10, 2025. The explosion resulted in multiple fatalities, and caused injuries to several others,"" said the resolution adopted by the Union cabinet, which met soon after PM Narendra Modi's return from Thimphu and his visit to LNJP hospital to meet the victims of the blast carried out by a module comprising radicalised doctors and clerics.Though the case regarding the blast has been registered under the main anti-terror law, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, and has been handed over to the National Investigation Agency , which is tasked with investigating terror incidents, the govt had until now not formally declared the blast a terror attack as such. The designation of ""terror incident"" is significant because of the anti-terror doctrine worked out by the Modi govt in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.As per the new policy, a terror attack, as the PM had spelt out in his address to the nation, is proposed to be treated and dealt with as an act of aggression against the country.Sources refrained from saying whether the blast on Monday fulfils the criterion and said a determination would be based on what the investigation across states might throw up. The cabinet, however, signalled its intent to use all options available to it against terror strikes. ""The cabinet reaffirms the govt's steadfast resolve to safeguard the lives and well-being of all Indians, consistent with its enduring commitment to national security and the safety of every citizen,"" it said.""The cabinet unequivocally condemns this dastardly and cowardly act that has led to the loss of innocent lives,"" it further said.The formal designation comes in the wake of mounting evidence that the ""Faridabad module"", increasingly being referred to as the ""white coat"" cell of terrorist organisation Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) because of the shocking alleged involvement of doctors, had multiple targets in different parts on their radar. The huge stockpile of explosives - enough to blow up a large shopping mall - and a cache of assault rifles recovered from the alleged terrorists are seen as underlining the intent to carry out ""spectacular strikes"" in solidarity with JeM which lost its senior leaders during Operation Sindoor. The blast was preceded by arrests of a doctor and a few others in Gujarat who were plotting to carry out a bio-terror attack by using ricin, one of the most dangerous substances known.Officials also believe that the explosive device in the car was meant for some other target and that it got accidentally triggered near the Red Fort.The cabinet, which observed two-minute silence, also praised ""the timely and coordinated response of the authorities, security agencies and citizens who acted with courage and compassion in the face of adversity. Their dedication and sense of duty are deeply commendable"".""The cabinet directs that the investigation into the incident be pursued with the utmost urgency and professionalism so that the perpetrators, their collaborators and their sponsors are identified and brought to justice without delay. The situation continues to be closely monitored at the highest levels of govt,"" said the resolution.","The designation of ""terror incident"" is significant because of the anti-terror doctrine worked out by the modi govt in the wake of the pahalgam attack. As per the new policy, a terror attack, as the pm had spelt out in his address to the nation, is proposed to be treated as an act of aggression against the country.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125288973,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-46552,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Bihar Exit Polls 2025: Poll of Polls Show NDA Poised For Majority, MGB Trails, No Impact of JSP

Two exit polls released Wednesday put NDA in the lead in Bihar, but while one projected a decisive verdict for BJP-led alliance with nearly two-thirds of the assembly's 243 seats, the other suggested it had a slender two percentage point lead in a close race and could be just a little over the halfway mark.The India Today-Axis My India poll projected that with 43% of the votes, NDA would get anywhere between 121 and 141 seats while the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan would end up with 41% of the votes and 98-118 seats. The midpoints of the ranges, at 131 and 108, are quite close to the verdict five years ago when NDA won 125 seats and MGB 110.Today's Chanakya projected 148-172 seats for the NDA and 65-89 seats for the MGB. The two-thirds mark is 162 seats. This poll gave the NDA a 44% vote share, six percentage points higher than the 38% projected for MGB.Both exit polls suggested that the much-talked-about Jan Suraaj of Prashant Kishor would have little impact and win few if any seats.Interestingly, the India Today poll forecasts that RJD will remain the single largest party in the assembly, but BJP could drop to the third spot with JDU improving its tally and the saffron party doing significantly worse than in 2020.Earlier, a slew of exit polls on Tuesday had all given NDA a clear majority in the state assembly, differing only in the extent of the incumbent alliance's victory.

NEW DELHI: Umar Un Nabi, confirmed by a DNA test as the bomber in Old Delhi, and his module had planned to carry out a ""spectacular terror attack "" with multiple vehicle-borne IEDs followed by firing with assault rifles. They had procured three vehicles - an i20, a red Ford Ecosport and a Brezza - for their mission, sources in the security establishment said on Wednesday.While the i20 exploded, cops issued a BOLO (be on the lookout) notice for the other two cars, an indication that more explosives may have been hidden by the module. The Ecosport, which has a Delhi registration number ending in 0458, was located Wednesday in Faridabad. A search is on for the Brezza. The cars were allegedly procured by Umar.The probe so far has revealed that besides Delhi, they were planning to target Ayodhya too. An attempt was to be made on Nov 25 during the hoisting of a saffron flag atop the Ram temple, said a source in a security agency. The suspects have revealed they were planning to use, and had collected, a mixture of ammonium nitrate and RDX, but it's unclear if that was the explosive in the car.The plot was hatched in Turkiye way back in 2022. As reported by TOI on Wednesday, Umar was acting on instructions from his Turkiye-based handler, identified by his codename Ukasa.A day after a car blast killed a dozen people near Red Fort, home minister Amit Shah chaired a set of meetings with the security brass and instructed agencies to hunt down every culprit behind the act.""Everyone involved in this act will face the full wrath of our agencies,"" Shah posted on X after the meetings.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the home minister from Bhutan and was briefed by the latter on all aspects of the blast, including the investigation updates. President Droupadi Murmu, who is in Angola, also spoke to Shah over the phone to enquire about the blast.The home minister on Tuesday decided to hand over the investigation into the incident to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). This points to a terror angle, though sources said it may have more to do with the Jaish terror module member linked to the blast.With Dr Umar, who had escaped the recent crackdown on the Faridabad module, suspected to be the car bomber, Shah has asked the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to match the DNA sample collected from the body found in the i20 car used for the blast with those of Dr Umar's family members.Sources in the J&K security establishment told TOI that DNA samples collected from Dr Umar's family members had been despatched to Delhi. Shah has asked FSL officials to complete the exercise at the earliest. The NIA was instructed to submit a report at the earliest, detailing the preliminary findings.Tuesday's review meetings by Shah were attended by home secretary Govind Mohan, director of Intelligence Bureau Tapan Deka, Delhi Police commissioner Satish Golcha and NIA DG Sadanand Vasant Date.DGP of Jammu and Kashmir Nalin Prabhat joined the meeting virtually.During the meetings, top officials gave detailed presentations on the situation in the aftermath of the blast, the sources said.","Umar un nabi, confirmed by a dna test as the bomber in old delhi, and his module had planned to carry out a ""spectacular terror attack "" with multiple vehicle-borne ieds followed by firing with assault rifles.

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Tuesday invoked stricter anti-pollution measures under Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi-NCR after the city's air quality slipped into the 'severe' category.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) said the decision was taken after Delhi's average Air Quality Index (AQI) surged from 362 on Monday to 425 on Tuesday morning, due to calm winds, a stable atmosphere, and unfavourable weather conditions that allowed pollutants to accumulate near the surface.The Stage III curbs, which include a ban on non-essential construction and the closure of stone crushers and mining activities, build upon the measures already enforced under Stages I and II of the GRAP.Classes up to Class 5 are required to shift to hybrid mode under Stage 3. Parents and students have the option to choose online education wherever available.Under Stage 3, the use of BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel cars (4-wheelers) is restricted in Delhi and nearby NCR districts. Persons with disabilities are exempt.Several parts of the city registered alarming pollution levels with AQI readings crossing the 400-mark.As per CPCB data, Anand Vihar recorded an AQI of 412, Alipur reported 442, and Bawana registered the highest level at 462.

Slow Traffic, Then Sudden Fireball: CCTV Captures The Delhi Red Fort Blast That Killed At Least 10

SRINAGAR: It took a doctor-cop to catch a “white-collar” terrorist network of doctors. When Jaish-e-Mohammed posters appeared overnight on Oct 19 across Nowgam-Bunpora in Srinagar, warning security forces of “dire consequences”, most residents brushed it off as a ghost from Kashmir’s violent past. For Srinagar SSP Dr GV Sundeep Chakravarthy, the signs were too deliberate — and too dangerous — to ignore.By dawn, he had ordered a case under UAPA, Explosive Substances Act, and Arms Act at Nowgam police station. CCTV footage combed frame by frame revealed three men. They were detained. Interrogation led to one name — Moulvi Irfan Ahmad of Shopian, who had led prayers at Nowgam mosque since 2020.Police teams moved fast. Ahmad’s Shopian home was searched. Another residence in Nowgam was examined. Digital footprints traced from his communications pointed to operatives beyond J&K — connections stretching into Haryana and UP.A team was dispatched. In coordinated follow-up action, police took custody of Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, a doctor from Pulwama working in a Faridabad medical college and allegedly linked to the Jaish network. What had begun as an inquiry into wall posters turned into the exposure of a sophisticated cross-state, “white-collar” module.Three Nowgam residents were also held.A senior officer called the effort “a thorough forward-and-backward investigation that mapped every link in the chain”. “It was a good investigative effort that led to the arrest of doctors based in UP and Haryana. During questioning, more links were identified, which led to seizures, including IED-making material,” the officer said.For Chakravarthy, the 2014-batch IPS officer, this was another chapter in a career defined by frontline counterterror operations. Born in Kallur in Andhra Pradesh’s Kurnool, son of retired govt medical officer Dr GV Rama Gopal Rao and health department official PC Rangamma, he studied medicine at Kurnool Medical College and graduated in 2010. He served there briefly as a doctor before trading the stethoscope for the service revolver.On Aug 14, he received his sixth President’s Police Medal for Gallantry for his role in multiple antiterrorism operations in J&K. He took charge as SSP Srinagar on Apr 21 this year. The poster probe now stands as one of his most intricate investigations — one that allegedly peeled back layers of radicalisation and revealed an unlikely alliance of a moulvi, medics, and modules.","Jaish-e-mohammed posters appeared overnight on oct 19 across nowgam-bunpora in srinagar.

A thwarted network of radical professionals

NEW DELHI: The high-intensity explosion near Delhi’s Red Fort that killed at least 12 people and injured several others has led to the unearthing of a trans-state “white-collar terror module” involving doctors, clerics, and radicalised professionals. According to officials, the accused were linked to banned terror outfits Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind (AGuH).Joint operations by the Jammu & Kashmir Police, Haryana Police, Uttar Pradesh Police, and central agencies resulted in the arrest of at least seven suspects — including doctors from Al-Falah University in Faridabad and other parts of India — and the recovery of more than 2,900 kilograms of explosives and firearms across multiple states.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has now taken over the probe.Dr Muzammil Ganaie, 35, from Koil in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, worked at Al-Falah University in Faridabad as a doctor and taught MBBS students. Police identified him as one of the key figures in the terror module.Following his arrest, officials recovered 358 kg of suspected ammonium nitrate, a Krinkov assault rifle, three magazines, 91 live rounds, a pistol with cartridges, timers, batteries, remote controls, and other bomb-making material from his rented accommodation in Dhauj, Faridabad.Police told agencies that Muzammil conducted multiple reconnaissance visits of the Red Fort area in January, mapping crowd movements and security positions. “These visits were part of a detailed reconnaissance ahead of a planned attack on January 26,” a senior police officer told PTI.According to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) team, around 40 samples collected from the Red Fort blast site indicated that one explosive sample was likely ammonium nitrate.Dr Adeel Ahmad Rather, from Kulgam in Kashmir, was arrested from Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh. He was also employed at Al-Falah University, working closely with Dr Muzammil and Dr Umar Un Nabi.Police sources told PTI that an AK-47 rifle was recovered from his locker at GMC Srinagar, where he had earlier worked as a senior resident. He is accused of being part of the Faridabad module that stockpiled explosives and weapons.Adeel’s arrest came after Muzammil’s interrogation, which revealed their collaboration in transporting and concealing explosives across multiple sites.Dr Umar Un Nabi, from Pulwama, was also associated with Al-Falah University and was reportedly driving the i20 car that exploded near the Red Fort, killing over 10 people.Sources told PTI that Dr Umar had been under surveillance but changed locations frequently. “He maintained close ties with Dr Muzammil and Dr Adeel, coordinating logistics and storage of explosives,” an official said.Authorities confirmed that Umar was present in the vehicle during the blast. His alleged role as the executioner of the attack places him among the most critical suspects in the ongoing probe.Dr Shaheen Sayeed, a doctor from Lucknow, is alleged to be an active associate and close confidant of Dr Muzammil. She was brought by air to Srinagar for custodial interrogation after an assault rifle was recovered from her car in Faridabad.Police said she panicked following Muzammil’s arrest and discarded the weapon in a dustbin. Dr Shaheen reportedly maintained communication between members in Faridabad and contacts in Kashmir.Investigators believe she played a role in logistical coordination for the group’s operations and possibly helped procure chemical materials.Dr Ahmed Mohiyuddin Saiyed, a Hyderabad-based doctor with an MBBS degree from China, was arrested by Gujarat ATS on November 8.He had been running a shawarma business in Rajendranagar, where he was allegedly radicalised through Telegram and social media. Authorities claim he was in contact with a handler named Abu Khadija linked to Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP).Police seized two Glock pistols, a Beretta, live ammunition, and 4 kg of castor-bean mash (used to extract ricin poison). Officials said he conducted reconnaissance of security-sensitive sites in Delhi, Lucknow, and Ahmedabad, with weapons possibly delivered via drones from Pakistan.Two of his aides, Azad Suleman Sheikh (20) and Mohammad Suhail Khan (23), were also arrested.Irfan Ahmad, a cleric and Imam from Shopian, is accused of radicalising several members of the module, including young doctors. Police said he was responsible for motivating recruits and connecting them with militant networks in Kashmir.He was arrested during follow-up raids in Shopian after Dr Muzammil’s confession pointed to his involvement.Maulvi Ishtiaq, a native of Mewat, Haryana, served as Imam at Al-Falah Mosque in Faridabad’s Dhera Colony. Police recovered over 2,500 kilograms of explosives from his residence within the Al-Falah University complex.Officials said he had been staying on campus under the guise of a religious teacher and was detained by Jammu and Kashmir Police before being brought to Srinagar for questioning.He is suspected of providing logistical support, including safe houses and connections to financial channels.Police on Tuesday took another Pulwama doctor, Sajad Malik, into custody for questioning, bringing the number of Kashmir-born doctors linked to the Delhi blast case to four.It remained unclear whether Malik's detention was aimed at gathering information about his friend Umar Un Nabi or if he was also being held as a suspect in the broader terrorism conspiracy.According to the police and intelligence agencies, the seven-member module used encrypted channels for communication, coordination, and movement of explosives.In Faridabad, questioning of over 52 individuals, including faculty and students of Al-Falah University, led to the recovery of the explosive materials and firearms.Subsequent raids in Shopian, Ganderbal, and Anantnag uncovered additional weapons, including an AK-56 rifle, pistols, and large quantities of IED components.Officials confirmed that Dr Muzammil and Dr Umar Un Nabi had plotted an attack during Republic Day celebrations, but the plan was delayed due to heightened security.After the Red Fort blast, the Delhi Police and paramilitary forces tightened security across the national capital. All entry and exit points were sealed, and vehicles were thoroughly checked.Senior officers supervised searches at interstate borders — including Ghazipur, Singhu, Tikri, and Badarpur — while sniffer dogs, anti-sabotage squads, and metal detectors were deployed at crowded locations.A senior police officer said, “We are taking no chances. The focus is on maintaining public confidence and ensuring that the city remains secure.”Officials described the module as a “white-collar terror network” that exploited academic institutions for recruitment and logistics.“The arrests have prevented a major conspiracy aimed at causing large-scale damage in the country,” an intelligence official said, adding that several Pakistani phone numbers were found on seized devices linked to the doctors.Investigations continue across Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, with more arrests expected in the coming days.(With inputs from PTI, Naseer Ganai and Nikhil Sharma)","The high-intensity explosion near delhi’s red fort that killed at least 12 people has led to the unearthing of a trans-state ‘white-collar terror module’ seven suspects have been arrested, including doctors from al-falah university in faridabad and other parts of india.

Slow Traffic, Then Sudden Fireball: CCTV Captures The Delhi Red Fort Blast That Killed At Least 10

NEW DELHI: A newly surfaced CCTV footage captured the precise moment the Hyundai i20 exploded near the Red Fort on Monday, sending shockwaves through the congested lanes of Old Delhi.In the clip, shared by news agency ANI, the car is seen suddenly bursting into flames, disintegrating within seconds and sending shards and flames flying across the street. The impact was so devastating that the nearby vehicles were engulfed and severely damaged, while panic gripped the crowded street.The government on Wednesday passed a resolution condemning the car blast near Delhi's Red Fort as a ""terrorist incident"".""The country has witnessed a heinous terrorist incident perpetrated by anti-national forces through a car explosion near Red Fort on 10th November,"" Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said during a Cabinet briefing, which began shortly after Prime Minister Narendra Modi concluded a Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meeting to review the situation and assess the ongoing probe into the attack.At least twelve people were killed and several others injured after a powerful explosion ripped through a Hyundai i20 car near the Lal Quila Metro Station on Monday evening.According to preliminary post-mortem findings, the victims sustained severe injuries, including multiple fractures and head trauma.The blast wave caused extensive internal damage, rupturing lungs, eardrums, and abdominal organs, while many victims showed deep wounds and heavy bleeding, suggesting they were thrown against hard surfaces by the force of the explosion.Forensic experts confirmed that no splinter traces were found on the bodies or clothing, and said the type of explosive used will be determined after laboratory analysis. Most injuries were concentrated on the upper body, head, and chest, officials said.Earlier in the day, the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) collected DNA samples from the mother of Dr Umar Un Nabi, who was allegedly driving the i20 car that exploded near the Red Fort on November 10, killing eight and injuring several others, according to sources.Meanwhile, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has formed a dedicated team to probe the Delhi car blast, which investigators believe was executed by a Jaish-e-Mohammad module recently unearthed by Indian security agencies. The team, headed by senior officers of the Superintendent of Police rank and above, will conduct a coordinated and comprehensive investigation.","Cctv footage captured the precise moment the hyundai i20 exploded near the red fort on monday.

‘Only Agencies Know the Truth’: Brother of Delhi Blast Accused Breaks Silence

NEW DELHI: Two days after the deadly car blast near Delhi’s Red Fort, new revelations from the family of arrested doctor Shaheen Sayeed have added a personal dimension to the ongoing terror investigation.Speaking to PTI in Lucknow, Mohammad Shoaib, Shaheen’s elder brother, has said the family is in “complete disbelief” over her alleged link to terrorist activities. He added that they were still struggling to come to terms with the accusations.He confirmed that the police and Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) officials had searched their home but behaved respectfully.“They searched the house and asked questions normally, the same way you are asking me now,” Shoaib said.“Neither my father nor I were treated harshly. There was no pressure or force used to make us say anything. They only asked about when my sister stopped visiting us.”Shoaib revealed that the family had not been in contact with Shaheen for the past four years. However, their parents occasionally called to check on her well-being.“We have had no contact. It’s been four years since we last spoke. Parents will naturally call their children to ask how they are doing.I am her elder brother, of course, I would also worry about her. Isn’t that normal?” he said.When asked if he had ever visited her residence near IIM Road in Lucknow, Shoaib replied: “No, I have never gone there. I only knew that she has a house somewhere along the IIM Road. I don’t even know the exact location.”He said there was never any reason to suspect her of wrongdoing.“Even when she was studying medicine, there was never any sign of her being involved in anything suspicious. I still don’t believe these allegations. As I have said before, I simply cannot believe it,” he said.Shaheen’s former husband, Dr Zafar Hayat, who lives in Kanpur, also expressed shock over her alleged role in the case. He said he learned about her arrest only a day earlier.Hayat and Shaheen married in November 2003 and got divorced in 2012. Both were doctors, and he recalled her as “a loving mother and caring person.”“Our divorce took place towards the end of 2012. I am not sure what was on her mind that led to it. There was never any dispute or quarrel between us. She was a loving and caring person,” he said.“I never had any inkling that she could be involved in such activities. She was deeply attached to her family and children, loved them immensely and took care of their studies,” Hayat added.Recalling their marriage, he said: “I had never seen her in a burqa. She only wore it during the wedding rituals. I have no idea about her alleged involvement in any terror activities now being reported. Our divorce happened long ago, in 2012, and if she got involved in something later, I know nothing about it.”He also remembered a conversation they once had about settling abroad.Dr Hayat recalled that Shaheen had once suggested settling in Australia or Europe for better pay and quality of life; however, he told her that they already had good jobs and a comfortable life in India, surrounded by family and friends.Hayat said he was unaware that Shaheen had returned to India and maintained that she showed no signs of any extremist beliefs during their years together.According to investigators, Dr Shaheen Sayeed, associated with Al-Falah University in Faridabad, was among those arrested following Monday’s explosion near the Red Fort.Police suspect she was linked to Dr Muzammil Ganaie, another faculty member at the same university, alleged to be part of a “white-collar terror module” with ties to Jaish-e-Mohammed and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind.Authorities said the module spread across Kashmir, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh was exposed after the recovery of 2,900 kg of explosives and the arrest of eight people, including three doctors from Al-Falah University.Investigators claim that Shaheen headed Jaish-e-Mohammed’s women’s recruitment wing, Jamaat-ul-Mominat in India.Her father, Syed Ahmad Ansari also expressed shock at the allegations.“I last spoke to Shaheen about a month ago. I have never heard her mention Dr Muzammil or anyone involved in such activities,” he said.Her father added that she had completed her medical studies in Prayagraj.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is probing the Red Fort blast which police said was caused by a high-intensity explosive device planted in a car.Investigations by police teams across Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are continuing into the wider multi-state module.The explosion occurred around 7 pm on Monday at the Subhash Marg traffic signal, near the Red Fort Metro Station. The high-intensity blast ripped through a slow-moving Hyundai i20 car, killing at least 12 people and injuring several others.","Mohammad shoaib, shaheen sayeed's elder brother, speaks to pti in lucknow.

AHMEDABAD: A 41-year-old man has approached Gujarat high court seeking a divorce from his wife on grounds of cruelty, alleging she brought stray dogs into their home and arranged a prank call about an imagined extra-marital affair, causing him public humiliation.According to the man's appeal, the couple married in 2006 and his troubles began when his wife introduced a stray dog into their flat in a society that prohibited dogs as pets. She then brought in additional strays, made him cook, clean and care for them. He said one dog bit him when it insisted on sleeping in their bed.The husband said the presence of the dogs turned neighbours against them, leading to a police complaint in 2008. He alleged that after his wife joined an animal rights group, she repeatedly filed police complaints against others, summoned him to stations to assist her, and, on his refusal, abused and humiliated him.He claimed the stress destroyed his well-being and led to erectile dysfunction. He also alleged that on April 1, 2007, his wife arranged for a radio jockey to make a prank call about his supposed affair, which embarrassed him at work and in society.The man said he fled to Bengaluru but his wife continued to harass him.He filed a divorce suit in 2017 in an Ahmedabad family court, but she defended it by arguing that he had deserted her and introduced her to animal activism. She produced photographs of him embracing and kissing the dogs.In Feb 2024, the family court dismissed his petition, stating, ""Considering the evidence, the petitioner has failed to prove that the respondent treated him with cruelty or has deserted him."" Regarding the prank call, it held, ""This cannot be the grounds for seeking divorce...""The husband appealed, asserting the marriage was irretrievably broken and offering to pay Rs 15 lakh in alimony, while his wife insisted on Rs 2 crore. A HC bench posted further hearing for December 1.","A 41-year-old man has approached gujarat high court seeking a divorce from his wife on grounds of cruelty.

The land deal controversy

Activist’s allegations and demand

Pawar’s defence and political response

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Wednesday responded to activist Anjali Damania’s demand for his resignation over an alleged Rs 300-crore land deal in Pune, saying he would “use his conscience” before making any decision.A company linked to his son, Parth Pawar is at the centre of the controversy surrounding the purchase of government-owned land in Pune’s Mundhwa area.The state government has since scrapped the deal and ordered an inquiry led by senior IAS officer Vikas Kharge.“I will use my conscience and take a decision,” Pawar told reporters in Pune when asked about Damania’s resignation demand, news agency PTI reported.The controversy involves around 40 acres of government land, reportedly valued at Rs 1,800 crore, which was sold to Amadea Enterprises LLP, a firm in which Parth Pawar holds a 99% partnership for Rs 300 crore. Following allegations of irregularities, the government cancelled the sale deed and suspended several officials.Revenue minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule confirmed that FIRs have been registered against three individuals involved in the transaction but said Parth Pawar’s name was not included, as it did not appear in the sale deed.However, the firm has been issued a notice to pay double stamp duty of Rs 42 crore to complete the cancellation process.Bawankule added that activist Anjali Damania met him on Wednesday and submitted documents related to the case.“I have told her that if she has any proofs, she can submit them to the inquiry committee,” he said, assuring that the probe would be free from interference.Anjali Damania accused Ajit Pawar of shielding his son and said a fair probe cannot happen while he remains in office, news agency United News of India (UNI) reported.“As long as Ajit Pawar is in power, a fair investigation is impossible. He must step down from both posts. Parth Pawar holds a 99% stake in the firm and yet no FIR has been registered against him,” Damania told reporters.She urged the state to register a case against Parth and ensure transparency in the inquiry.The deputy chief minister has denied any wrongdoing, calling the allegations “random accusations” raised before local body elections. He maintained that Parth was unaware the land was government-owned.“I still don’t understand how a document can be registered without even a rupee being exchanged. The truth will come out soon,” he said.He also said he had already briefed chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and welcomed the inquiry.“If anyone close to me has done something wrong, I will never support it. I have told the Chief Minister to order a probe,” Pawar said. He added that the issue was “a lesson” for his son to be more cautious in future dealings.Meanwhile, minister Bawankule reiterated that the inquiry would continue independently under ACS Vikas Kharge.Bawankule said the officer heading the inquiry is honest and that there will be no interference in the investigation.","M maharashtra deputy chief minister ajit pawar responds to activist anjali damania’s demand for his resignation over an alleged rs 300-crore land deal in pune.

"Supreme Court flags illegal mining, reserves verdict on single definition of Aravalis",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-flags-illegal-mining-reserves-verdict-on-single-definition-of-aravalis/articleshow/125287433.cms,"Need to evolve framework for sustainable use: Panel

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday said rampant illegal mining in Aravali range, the natural barrier spread across Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Delhi that's preventing desertification of Gangetic plains, is causing immense damage to the sensitive eco-system. The court reserved verdict on the issue of a uniform definition of what the Aravali range is.Amicus curiae and senior advocate K Parameshwar told a bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria that the report submitted by the expert committee set up by the SC in May last year on this issue appears to be oriented towards how to allow mining in the Aravalis rather than focusing on stringent measures to protect it.The entire Aravali Range must be protected as one geographical and morphological entity along with its eco-system and the protective measures cannot be allowed to be varied from state to state. He said along with conservation of Aravali range, restoration of its pristine form is equally important,"" Parameshwar said, adding that he must not be understood to advocate blanket ban on mining activities.The bench said a complete ban always leads to rampant illegal mining and we have seen how a hillock in Aravali was reduced to a column and how a road was illegally built in Nuh district for clandestine transportation of mined minerals from Haryana to Rajasthan.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, while complimenting the amicus for his zealous approach towards protection of the Aravali Range, said the SC-appointed committee has addressed every concern of the amicus while giving stringent guidelines for regulated mining under the principle of sustainable development. The bench agreed with her.The committee in its report said that all hillocks have a height of over 100m (from mean sea level) and these should be protected along with its slopes. ""Keeping in view the immense ecological and environmental significance of Aravalli hills and ranges, owing to their rich biodiversity and the wide range of ecosystem services they provide, such as groundwater recharge, regulation of desertification, and moderation of the regional microclimate, it becomes imperative to protect and conserve the area from further degradation,"" it said.""Core/inviolate areas - protected forests and tiger reserves and one km from their boundaries, eco-sensitive zones, afforestation areas and 500m from Ramsar sites and wetlands - may be designated in the Aravali hills and ranges for prohibiting mining in them,"" the committee said.However, the committee flagged that the Aravali range contains well-known repositories of base metals such as lead, zinc, and copper, as well as precious and strategic minerals including gold and tungsten. ""In addition, the Aravali-Delhi system has been identified as having significant potential for critical minerals such as tin, graphite, molybdenum, niobium, nickel, lithium, and rare earth elements (REEs), all of which are of growing strategic relevance for energy transition, high-technology manufacturing, and national security,"" it said.The committee opined that while the ecological and environmental integrity of the Aravali Hills and Ranges must remain the foremost priority, it is also necessary to evolve a framework that enables sustainable exploitation of critical, strategic and atomic minerals located within the region.""In view of the ecological significance of the Aravali hills and ranges, the committee recommends that the following environmental safeguards and regulatory measures be adopted by respective state governments to encourage systematic, sustainable, and environmentally friendly mining while effectively preventing illegal mining using modern and information technology tools,"" it said.","The entire aravali range must be protected as one geographical and morphological entity along with its eco-system.
