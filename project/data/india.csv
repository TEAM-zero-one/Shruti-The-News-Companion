Source - ANI

NEW DELHI: BJP MPs Nishikant Dubey and Sanjay Jaiswal have filed a ""breach of privilege and contempt"" notice against several opposition members and urged Speaker Om Birla for disciplinary action against them for ""continuously obstructing"" the House's proceedings when rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan was piloting the G RAM G BillOfficial sources said Birla is examining the matter. The Speaker was critical of the excessive disruption by several MPs, some of whom reached the table of Lok Sabha officials in an attempt to disrupt proceedings, on Wednesday.Dubey named Hibi Eden, Dean Kuriakose, S Murasoli, K Gopinath, Sashikant Senthil, Shafi Parambil, S Venkateshan and Jothimani, all from different opposition parties, in his notice.In his letter to Birla, he accused them of continuously obstructing the smooth functioning of the House by creating obstructions for Chouhan and the officers assisting the House.""As such, this is misconduct in the presence of House, disobedience to the authority of Speaker, obstructing officers of the House in discharge of their duties which is clearly a breach of privileges of Members of Parliament collectively and the contempt of the House,"" he added.He urged Birla to take ""strict action"" against against the opposition MPs ""so that in future this kind of incidents do not re-occur"".When Chouhan was responding to the debate, opposition members rushed to the Well of the House, tore copies of the Bill and stood on tables to register their protest against the provisions of the rural job guarantee Bill, which will replace the 20-year-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA).The Speaker's office is also examining the opposition's notice for removal from office of Madras high court Judge GS Swaminathan and also the complaint filed against a TMC MP for vaping inside Lok Sabha even as e-cigarette is banned across the country.As the session came to an end, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju lauded this sitting of Parliament as a milestone in PM Narendra Modi's push for ""reform express"", highlighting the passage of some key legislations covering rural employment, insurance and nuclear energy.He also blamed the opposition for the absence of discussion on air pollution in Delhi-NCA, claiming that the govt was keen for it but Congress wanted to continue with loud protest against the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) Bill and persuaded other opposition parties as well.Rijiju, however, termed the session as ""very productive"" as eight bills were passed after debates in both Houses. These legislations will ""speed up"" the 'reform express' flagged off by Modi to bring improvement in the everyday life of the common people. The reform express will continue, he added.""But the opposition's behaviour during the debate in Lok Sabha on Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) Bill was unacceptable. Some of the opposition members even stood atop the desks of the table office and (Lok Sabha) secretary general. Some Congress members also conveyed that there was no need for a debate on pollution. That is why the issue could not be taken up for discussion,"" he said.In Lok Sabha, Birla noted that the House's productivity topped 111% and was marked by a marathon discussion of over 11.30 hours to commemorate 150th anniversary of Vande Mataram.","Bjp mps nishikant dubey and sanjay jaiswal have filed a ""breach of privilege and contempt"" notice against several opposition members.

BARUIPUR (WEST BENGAL): An FIR has been registered against BJP leader and National In-Charge of the party's IT Cell, Amit Malviya, at the Narendrapur Police Station under the Baruipur Police Station, alleging that his social media post threatened communal harmony and the sovereignty of India.According to the complaint received on Friday by Narendrapur Police Station, All India Trinamool Congress leader and State General Secretary and Spokesperson Tanmoy Ghosh accused Malviya of posting an ""incendiary statement"" on the social media X platform on December 19. The complaint references a specific post, claiming it amounted to ""formal instigation against communal harmony"" and posed a ""substantial threat"" to the country's sovereignty.The complainant further alleged that the post constituted a direct insult to West Bengal, the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC), and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee . The letter urged the police to initiate strict legal action against the BJP leader under relevant sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) and any other applicable laws.Police sources confirmed that the complaint had been received and acknowledged by Narendrapur Police Station.However, officials said no FIR has been registered to date and that the matter is under preliminary examination.Further action, officials said, will be taken after the complaint and the social media post in question are reviewed.In the X post against which the FIR was filed, Amit Malviya stated that the ongoing vandalism in Dhaka, Bangladesh, was a ""warning"". He noted that this is ""how societies unravel when extremism is appeased, and lawlessness is normalised."" In reference to incident, he stated that, ""It is also why the trajectory of West Bengal under Mamata Banerjee is deeply worrying."" In the end, he said, ""Culture, free expression, and democracy cannot survive where mobs rule, and the state looks away. ""The X post stated, "" Last night, Islamist mobs vandalised Chhayanaut Bhavan, a historic institution and a cornerstone of Bengali arts and culture in Dhaka. The pattern unfolding in Bangladesh is unmistakable: attacks on media houses, journalists, and cultural centres, carried out under Islamist pressure and intimidation. This is a warning. This is exactly how societies unravel when extremism is appeased, and lawlessness is normalised. It is also why the trajectory of West Bengal under Mamata Banerjee is deeply worrying. Years of political patronage, erosion of institutions, and selective silence have pushed Bengal onto a dangerous path. If Mamata Banerjee's decrepit regime continues beyond 2026, the consequences for Bengal will be irreversible. Culture, free expression, and democracy cannot survive where mobs rule, and the state looks away.""The development adds to the ongoing political tensions between the ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal and the Bharatiya Janata Paty, with leaders from both sides frequently trading accusations over social media conduct and alleged attempts to disturb communal peace, as the West Bengal elections in 2026 approach.Further details awaited.

NEW DELHI: In a first of its kind order, Supreme Court has imposed a cost of Rs 10 crore each on 10 private dental colleges in Rajasthan for admitting students who did not secure threshold marks in NEET 2016-17, the basis for admission to all medical and dental courses across India.A bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and Vijay Bishnoi Thursday asked the colleges to deposit the cost with Rajasthan State Legal Services Authority and said it would be invested in fixed deposits and the interests would be utilised for maintenance, upgrade and improvement of 'One Stop Centres', Nari Niketans, old-age homes as well as childcare institutions established by Rajasthan govt.Accepting arguments of Rishabh Sancheti, who represented 59 students, and other advocates, SC invoked its exclusive powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to regularise the degrees of those who, though admitted illegally to the 2016-17 BDS courses, passed out and were awarded qualifications. The relief to the students, whose future was in suspense as their degrees were not regularised, came with a caveat. The bench directed them to file affidavits before Rajasthan HC offering pro bono services to the state govt as and when they are called upon to serve people during calamities, outbreak of diseases or other emergencies in the state.Writing the judgment, Justice Bishnoi said, ""The colleges are directed to deposit a cost of Rs 10 crore each, and the state of Rajasthan is directed to deposit a sum of Rs 10 lakh with the Rajasthan State Legal Services Authority within a period of eight weeks.""The bench requested the Rajasthan HC Chief Justice to constitute a five-judge committee, including at least one woman judge, to ensure effective utilisation of the interest amount accruing from the fixed deposit of Rs 100 crore.Expressing strong displeasure over the way standards of medical education are being diluted as reflected in the case in hand, the bench said, ""The colleges committed blatant illegality and wilful violation of the 2007 regulations while admitting students beyond the permitted relaxation of percentile, thus warranting strict punitive action.""""Further, the state of Rajasthan also acted without any authority of law while granting relaxations and failed to timely inform the colleges of the decisions of the central govt and the Dental Council of India,"" it said.Given the lowering of minimum mark criteria for admission, several students were found to be still pursuing their BDS degree courses despite passage of nine years since admission. The bench said they would be discharged from the course as the 2007 regulation allowed a student a maximum of nine years to clear the five-year degree course.","To be utilised for state’s ‘one stop centres’, nari niketans, old-age homes.

How time changes everything,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-time-changes-everything/articleshow/126077954.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. I once encountered an incident in an interview given by Thiru Waleswaran, the late son of V O Chidambaram Pillai — one of India’s greatest freedom fighters. In the interview, Waleswaran spoke of a visit to a govt office where he was asked to pay a bribe. He wished to challenge it legally, but he did not. He could not afford even the court fee. The irony was piercing. A system demanding a bribe from the son of a man who had sacrificed everything for the freedom of that very system. Martyrs are tested not only by their enemies, but by time itself. Their intentions are questioned, their sacrifices measured anew. History, like a ceaseless river, carries within it blood and compassion, rage and reconciliation, heroism and humility. When we scoop a single moment from its waters, we see only a fragment. But when we step back and watch the river flow across generations, history begins to speak in a deeper, humbler voice. Another incident I came across belongs to that deeper current. On the morning of June 17, 1911, at Maniyachi railway station, Vanchinathan, a young Tamil revolutionary, shot and killed Robert Ashe, the British collector of Tirunelveli. Moments later, Vanchi took his own life. One man fell as a representative of imperial authority; the other died as an embodiment of fierce resistance. Ashe’s wife Mary returned to her country with her four children — two daughters and two sons. Empires receded, flags changed, and the fury of that morning slowly settled into the footnotes of history. More than a century passed. Then, quietly, history curved back on itself. While researching the life of V O Chidambaram Pillai and the upheaval in Tirunelveli following his arrest, historian A R Venkatachalapathy came across records of the Ashe murder trial. His research led him not only to documents, but to people — Robert Ashe’s descendants: a grandson named after him, a granddaughter and other members. During a meeting, they raised a toast in memory of both Ashe and Vanchinathan. Later, they wrote a letter to the family of Vanchinathan and sent it through Venkatachalapathy. It was not a letter of accusation. Nor was it an attempt to rewrite the past. It was a letter of reconciliation. “On this day of sad but proud remembrance,” they wrote, “we extend a message of reconciliation and friendship to the Vanchi family. Vanchi was an idealist political campaigner whose zeal for the freedom of his beloved India sent Robert to his early grave. Moments later, he took his own young life… All who act fervently in the political arena, both ruler and oppressed, risk making mortal mistakes. We who are fortunate enough to live on must forgive and live in peace together.” Across a hundred years, the descendants of the ruler and the rebel reached out — not to justify, but to understand. It is here that a Kural quietly enters the river of thought. Valluvar writes: EnnaIMun NillanMin Thevveer PalarEnnaI MunNindru KalNin dravar. (Kural 771) Foes! Do not oppose my chief. Those who did so before, now are entombed. At first glance, it sounds like a cry of martial pride — a warrior hailing an unconquerable leader. But as writer Jeyamohan has reflected, who could such a chief truly be? No human ruler remains undefeated. No ideology escapes erosion. Perhaps the chief Valluvar speaks of is not a king or a commander, but time itself. Time alone defeats all — the tyrant and the martyr, the victor and the vanquished. It buries rage, exposes arrogance, humbles power, and sometimes ripens forgiveness. And yet, some acts endure: the courage of Vanchinathan, the sacrifice of Chidambaram Pillai, and a letter written by the descendants of Robert Ashe.","Thirukkural with the times explores real-world lessons from the classic tamil text.

'Letter drafted with BJP mindset': Why Congress should not ignore message of sacked Odisha leader Mohammed Moquim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/letter-drafted-with-bjp-mindset-why-congress-should-not-ignore-message-of-sacked-odisha-leader-mohammed-moquim/articleshow/126060393.cms,"Letter To Sonia Gandhi Costs Ex Odisha MLA Moquim Party Post As Congress Cites Anti Party Activities

“The party's presence is shrinking geographically, organisationally, and even emotionally.”

“The party is losing its legacy not because of external opponents but due to decisions taken within.”

""A series of wrong decisions, misguided leadership choices, and the continued concentration of responsibility in the wrong hands have weakened the party from within. Rather than correcting these errors, we appear to be repeating them and the consequences are now visible to the entire nation.”

“The booth workers, block presidents, district-level leaders, who are truly the backbone of the party, feel ""unseen and unheard"" and this ""alienation"" makes electoral conversions nearly impossible.”

“There has been a growing distance between the leadership and the grassroots workers. Despite being an MLA, I was unable to meet Shri Rahul Gandhi ji for almost three years"".

NEW DELHI: The Congress has once again crushed dissidence with an “iron hand.” The expulsion of Odisha leader and former MLA Mohammed Moquim, after he went public about a letter he had written to Sonia Gandhi against the party leadership, was a given. The fact that the Congress justified its action and accused Moquim of operating with “BJP mindset” and working for the “interests of the saffron party” was also not a surprise.We have seen the grand-old-party go through this drill many times in the last 11 years as its political fortunes declined across the states. Several Congress leaders, both at the national level and at the state level, have openly targeted the top leadership and faced action. We all remember the group of 23 Congress leaders (G-23) who had in 2020 written a letter to Sonia Gandhi demanding “collective and inclusive leadership” in the party. While some of these dissidents were expelled, others voluntarily left the party but nothing changed in the way Congress functioned.This time, while the Congress may be perhaps right in questioning the intent of Mohammed Moquin, it would do well by not ignoring the message of the former MLA-turned-rebel by labelling him a BJP stooge. “Giving a letter to Sonia ji is acceptable, but releasing it to the press is not. This clearly indicates that he does not want to stay in the Congress,” Odisha Congress chief Bhakta Charan Das said justifying the party action.Ironically, Bhakta Charan Das was one of the targets of Moquim’s letter. The expelled MLA had questioned Das’s appointment as state party chief and his capability to deliver results in the state citing his past electoral performance. Moquim’s other targets were Rahul Gandhi and party chief Mallikarjun Kharge .So, what was Moquim’s communication? Here are some of the stinging statements that Moquim made in his letter:Well, a lot of what Moquim said in his letter have been raised before by many leaders who have parted ways with the grand old party in the past. Ironically, his remarks against the national leadership, especially on Rahul Gandhi’s inaccessibility and Kharge’s age, masked his pointed attacks on the party’s leadership in Odisha.Moquim highlighted the fact that the Congress had lost 6 consecutive elections in Odisha and expressed concern over the party's recent electoral performance in the Nuapada by-elections, where BJP defeated Congress by a huge margin despite the fact that Nuapada fell under the constituency of the present state Congress chief.“Under the leadership of Das, in the Nuapada by-election, his own parliamentary segment, the Congress lost by an unprecedented margin of nearly 83,000 votes. When a leader cannot secure trust in his own constituency, workers naturally lose confidence in his leadership and raise concerns in his ability to guide the party in Odisha,” the former MLA wrote in his letter.He also pointed out the failures of the Bhakta Charan Das’s predecessor Sarat Pattanayak: “Having lost six consecutive Lok Sabha elections, sometimes forfeiting his deposit, his appointment weakened morale at all levels. Under his leadership, the 2024 elections witnessed the lowest vote share in our history — just 13%. He again lost his own election, once more forfeiting his deposit,” he wrote questioning the party’s decision to appoint state chiefs who could not secure their own victories.Odisha, like many other states, has seen the Congress gradually decline to oblivion. The last time Congress won in Odisha was in 1995. Since then, it has been a story of decline. In 2000 it won 26 seats, 38 in 2004, 27 in 2009 and 10 in 2014. In 2019, the Congress tally in Odisha was reduced to single-digit 9 seats and could win 14 in 2024. The grand-old-party that ruled Odisha for several years, first ceded space to regional party Biju Janata Dal and then to the BJP - a story which has defined its existence in the last 10 years. The Congress has remained on the sidelines - doing little to revive the party’s lost glory in the state.The Congress in Odisha at present is perhaps in no position to challenge the ruling BJP. However, if the grand-old-party makes a sincere effort, it could make forays into the support base of the BJD, which took an unprecedented beating in the 2024 assembly elections and now depends heavily on an aging Naveen Patnaik for its revival. Unfortunately, there seems to be no Congress roadmap for revival. The state leadership could do better than holding protests over the court order on National Herald case if they want to pose any real challenge to the BJP or the BJD.The story of Congress decline is similar in several other states where the grand-old-party was first relegated to the sidelines by regional parties and then decimated to oblivion by the BJP.

Parliament debate on SIR

What is SIR

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief electoral officer Archana Patnaik on Friday said the draft electoral roll, after the Special Intensive Revision (SIR), for the state now includesvoters, comprising 2.66 crore women and 2.77 crore men.She said that prior to the SIR, the poll-bound state had around 6.41 crore registered voters, and the exercise led to the deletion ofnames from the rolls.According to Patnaik, the deletions included 26.94 lakh voters who had died, 66.44 lakh voters who had permanently shifted or migrated, andduplicate entries where individuals were found to be registered in more than one place.She added that among those marked as migrated,persons were found not residing at their registered addresses after three rounds of door-to-door verification conducted across the state.The SIR in the DMK-ruled state was conducted amid vehement opposition by chief minister MK Stalin , whose party filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the major roll-revision exercise in the southern state.“To prevent this anti-democratic move, we convened an all-party meeting and passed a resolution condemning the SIR. The Election Commission’s decision to carry out a full revision of the electoral roll just months before the election is part of a well-planned strategy to delete legitimate voters,” CM Stalin said while criticising the Election Commission's electoral roll sanitisation exercise.Also read: Nearly 74 lakh names deleted from Gujarat rolls; EC opens window for objections CM Stalin added that the same tactic was used earlier in Bihar, where lakhs of genuine voters were allegedly ""removed from the list"".He also pointed out that opposition to this controversial process had first emerged from Tamil Nadu, after which the Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who also happens to be the Lok Sabha leader of opposition, raised strong objections.“Even after a legal case was filed, the Election Commission did not give a satisfactory explanation,” CM Stalin said.Taking aim at AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami, CM Stalin accused him of “playing a double game” and being “afraid of the Election Commission due to his ties with the BJP.”He added that while migrant workers from Bihar had found livelihood and respect in Tamil Nadu, the Prime Minister was “playing political drama in Bihar for electoral gain.”Nearly 74 lakh voters have been removed from Gujarat’s draft electoral rolls following the completion of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise, reducing the state’s total electorate to 4.34 crore from 5.08 crore earlier, officials said on Friday.The Election Commission published the draft electoral rolls on Friday, after which 73.73 lakh names were omitted as part of the roll-cleaning exercise, Gujarat Chief Electoral Officer Hareet Shukla said.“Before the publication of the draft rolls, Gujarat had 5,08,43,436 registered voters. After the revision, the number stands at 4,34,70,109,” Shukla said.According to the CEO’s office, the deletions included 18,07,278 deceased voters, 9,69,662 absent voters, 40,25,553 voters who had permanently migrated, 3,81,470 duplicate entries, and 1,89,364 names removed under other categories.On Tuesday, the Election Commission published a draft list of deleted voters after the SIR of the electoral rolls in West Bengal. The list features voters whose names were included in the state’s electoral rolls in 2025 but were deleted from the draft rolls of 2026.This came after the first phase of the SIR exercise ended on December 11. The second phase, which began after December 16, will involve the filing of claims and objections.The notice phase, which includes issuance, hearings, verification and decisions on enumeration forms, as well as disposal of claims and objections, will be carried out concurrently by Electoral Registration Officers (EROs).The SIR issue was also debated and discussed at length during the Winter Session of the parliament, with the Leader of the Rajya Sabha JP Nadda and other key minister in the NDA government urging the opposition parties to come together to back the SIR of the electoral roll, while pointing out how West Bengal has seen a massive spike in its electorate from 4.8 crore to 7.6 crore since the last SIR in 2002.Nadda, citing ECI data during the debate in Rajya Sabha on electoral reforms, said the minimum increase in voters' list of the 9 West Bengal districts bordering Bangladesh was 70 per cent since 2002, while the maximum had crossed 100 per cent.He shared that Uttar Dinajpur has witnessed the highest spike in electors at 105.5 per cent, Malda at 94.8 per cent, Murshidabad at 87.6 per cent, 24 Parganas at 83.5 per cent and Jalpaiguri at 82.3 per cent.The Election Commission of India (ECI) conducts a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls to ensure the accuracy and completeness of voter lists ahead of major elections. The exercise involves a detailed door-to-door verification to identify and remove duplicate, shifted or deceased entries while enrolling new and first-time voters.Carried out under the Representation of the People Act, 1950, the SIR aims to maintain the integrity of the electoral rolls by updating demographic details and correcting inaccuracies.During the revision, booth-level officers visit households, verify electors’ details, and facilitate claims and objections. The process is a key part of the Commission’s voter roll management, ensuring that every eligible citizen is included and the rolls reflect the most current and authentic data before elections.","Tamil nadu chief electoral officer archana patnaik on friday said the draft electoral roll, after the special intensive revision (sir), for the state now includes 2.66 crore women and 2.77 crore men. She said that prior to the sir, the poll-bound state had around 6.41 crore registered voters.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126077639,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-58214,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

'We Are United...Will Go To Delhi If High Command Calls': Siddaramaiah, Shivakumar After Meeting

NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah on Friday dismissed claims of a two-and-a-half-year “power-sharing arrangement” within the state government.Facing repeated questions from the Opposition over his tenure on the last day of the Legislative Assembly session in Belagavi, Siddaramaiah said there was no such agreement in place and made it clear that he would remain the CM until the party high command decides otherwise.“First, the people must bless us. Then the legislators elect the leader in the Legislative Party meeting, and after that, the high command decides. That is all I have said. Even now, I am the Chief Minister, and I will remain the Chief Minister until the high command decides otherwise,” he said.Reacting to Siddaramaiah’s remarks, BJP MLA and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, R Ashoka, questioned the claim, saying, “You were elected for five years by the Legislative Party. What about 2.5 years?”Siddaramaiah responded, “I never said anything about two and a half years. There is no such agreement as two and half years.”Earlier this week, the CM reiterated that he would complete his full term. “We will complete the full term and return to power in 2028...I’m the CM till the high command says,” Siddaramaiah said.Speculation over a possible change in leadership, with Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar taking over the CM seat in January gained momentum over the past few days. The Congress later sought to put the rumours to rest after Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar met for breakfast at each other’s residences and addressed the media together to project party unity.DK Shivakumar also dismissed speculation surrounding a reported dinner meeting. “Who said? There was no dinner meeting or anything. I had gone for a dinner to my former DCC president to pay respect, they contributed a lot to Karnataka, Belgavi. So to honor them, I went along with my friends. There is no other politics,” he said.","Karnataka chief minister siddaramaiah dismissed claims of a two-and-a-half-year ""power-sharing arrangement"" within the state government.

Opposition's midnight protest outside Parliament

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha adjourned sine die on Friday, ending the 19-day Parliament Winter Session, which was marked by a series of moments that went viral, capturing the chaos, confrontation and occasional absurdity that unfolded inside Parliament.Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla announced the adjournment for an indefinite period, noting a productivity of 111 percent of the house during the session.Over 15 sittings, several key Bills were passed, including legislation opening up the civil nuclear sector to private companies.The session was dominated by the passage of the Viksit Bharat–Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill, which replaces MNREGA and guarantees 125 days of employment for rural households, amid loud Opposition protests.Debates also covered election reforms and 150 years of ‘Vande Mataram,’ reflecting both the legislative and dramatic moments of the session.Controversy arose after BJP MP Anurag Thakur accused a Trinamool Congress MP of vaping inside the Lok Sabha. BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya later identified the lawmaker as TMC leader Kirti Azad.Malviya wrote on X, “For people like him, rules and laws hold no meaning. Hiding an e-cigarette in his palm inside the House is unacceptable.Smoking may not be illegal, but using it in Parliament is.” He also called on West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee to comment on the alleged misconduct.Earlier, Thakur had submitted a written complaint to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, seeking action against the TMC MP for using an e-cigarette, though he did not name the lawmaker at the time.Former Union minister and Congress MP Renuka Chowdhury brought a puppy into Parliament on the first day of the session. She said she had rescued it after seeing it near the site of a road accident while on her way to the House. Concerned for its safety, she carried the puppy in her vehicle.Taking a jibe at the BJP, Chowdhury said, ""The real ones (dogs) who bite are sitting in Parliament. They run the government. We take care of a mute animal, and this has become a big issue and a topic of discussion. Does the government have nothing else to do? I sent the dog home and told them to keep it at home... We don't talk about those who sit in Parliament and bite us every day,"" she said.When asked about a possible privilege motion, she barked at reporters. “Bhow, bhow… aur kya bolun?” she said, adding that serious issues like pollution-related deaths, suicides of booth-level officers, and labour laws were being ignored while the focus remained on her dog.Unruly scenes erupted during the passage of the VB-G RAM G Bill, which replaced the 20-year-old MGNREGA. Opposition MPs, mostly from the Congress, stormed the well of the House, shouted slogans, and tore copies of the Bill after their demand to refer it to a parliamentary committee was rejected.The disruptions continued as the government pushed the legislation through, prompting repeated warnings from the Chair.Rural Development Minister Shivraj Chouhan criticised the Opposition, calling the tearing of pages and MPs climbing onto tables a “murder of Bapu’s ideals.”""The behaviour of the opposition in the Lok Sabha today, including members of the Congress and the INDIA Alliance, has undermined the integrity of our democracy. Parliamentary decorum has been thoroughly disregarded. Democracy has been transformed into mobocracy. We listened carefully to the opposition. I said I would answer each question, but I should be heard. But pages were torn, and they got onto the tables. Isn't it a murder of Bapu's (Mahatma Gandhi) ideals?""Tempers flared during a debate on the Special Intensive Revision when Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi challenged Home Minister Amit Shah to an open debate over allegations of “vote chori.”Rahul insisted on answers about immunity granted to election commissioners and alleged the presence of 19 lakh fake voters. “""My question yesterday was that for the first time in history, full immunity was given to the election commissioner. I wanted to know the reasoning behind this decision. Secondly, about Haryana, he [Amit Shah] took one example of fake voters, but there are 19 lakh fake voters,” Rahul said.He added, “Let us have a debate on my press conference. Amit Shah ji, I challenge you to have a debate.”Shah responded sharply, saying Parliament would not function according to Rahul Gandhi’s wishes and that he would decide the sequence of his speech.Shah responded sharply, saying Parliament would not function according to Rahul Gandhi’s wishes. “I will decide the sequence of my speech. Parliament will not work like this,” he said. He asked Rahul to have patience and said he would answer every question.Rahul called Shah’s response “defensive” and “scared.”Opposition protests over the G RAM G Bill culminated in dramatic walkouts, as members accused the government of rushing the legislation through without proper debate and scrapping a flagship rural employment scheme that supported crores of households.Despite repeated warnings from the Chair, Opposition MPs continued shouting slogans before walking out of the House in protest. They condemned the Bill for undermining rural livelihoods and bypassing parliamentary scrutiny. The walkouts underscored the tense atmosphere in the House, which persisted until the legislation was ultimately passed.Amid the acrimony in Parliament, a lighter moment unfolded during Question Hour when Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra sought a meeting with Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari to discuss landslides on the Chandigarh–Shimla highway and road projects in her Wayanad constituency.Gadkari responded promptly, saying no appointment was necessary and invited her to his chamber. During their discussion, Priyanka noted the recurring landslides on the Chandigarh–Shimla highway, pointing out that low retaining walls were failing to prevent slope collapses. She also raised concerns about six road projects passing through Kerala, including some under the Centre’s purview.Gadkari assured her that he would look into the issues. At one point, he humorously remarked, referencing her brother Rahul Gandhi, “Bhai ka kaam kar diya, behen ka nahin karunga toh aap bolenge ki nahi kiya” (“You’ll complain that I addressed your brother’s concerns but not yours”), drawing laughter from Priyanka and others present.Eyewitnesses also noted a quirky culinary moment: Gadkari offered Priyanka a rice dish he had prepared after watching YouTube videos, which Congress MP Deepender Singh Hooda was seen tasting while chatting with the minister.The protest over the Bill spilled beyond Parliament hours, with Opposition parties staging a 12-hour overnight dharna in the Parliament complex on Thursday night.As Rajya Sabha cleared the legislation after midnight by a voice vote, following its earlier approval in the Lok Sabha, Opposition MPs renewed demands for the Bill’s withdrawal and referral to a parliamentary panel, but the government rejected their appeals.Trinamool Congress leader Sagarika Ghose accused the Centre of “bulldozing” the legislation, calling it an insult to India’s poor and alleging that MPs were given barely five hours’ notice without a proper debate.","Lok sabha adjourned sine die on friday, ending the 19-day parliament winter session.

The most vulnerable regions are concentrated in three broad zones:

Northwest India: Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh — where groundwater recharge exists but indiscriminate withdrawal, driven largely by agriculture, has led to over-extraction.

Bengaluru water crisis

Why is India running out of water?



Rising demand: India’s water demand is expected to outstrip supply by 2030

Agricultural overuse: Water-intensive crops like paddy in Punjab and Haryana

Encroachment of water bodies: Lakes and ponds disappearing, especially in cities like Bengaluru

Climate change: Erratic monsoons and declining river flows

Pollution: Industrial waste, sewage, and mining contaminating groundwater

Weak regulation: Outdated laws like the Easement Act of 1882, which ties groundwater ownership to land

Fragmented governance: Separate authorities for surface and groundwater management

Public apathy: Water treated as a free, unlimited resource

Groundwater overuse and contamination



Nearly 70% of groundwater sources are contaminated

India ranks 120th out of 122 countries on the global water quality index

State and UT-wise classification shows:

Over-exploited (>100%): Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan

Critical (90–100%): Delhi

High stress (70–90%): Tamil Nadu and Puducherry

Moderate to low stress (<70%): All remaining states and UTs, including Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, West Bengal, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and several northeastern states.

Behind this lies a darker reality, an informal and often illegal groundwater trade.

In a narrow lane of India, men and women wait quietly with plastic drums lined in rows. Some squat, some sit, with eyes fixed on the bend ahead.Suddenly, the silence breaks. A water tanker reverses into the alley, its engine drowning out the waiting. Young men rush forward, climbing atop the truck, lowering pipes into the tank. Within moments, quiet order unravels into chaos.Hundreds of kilometres away, in rural India, women walk long distances to empty wells, dried-up tubewells and shrinking water bodies, hoping to find a few litres of water.Just because some cities suffered floods doesn’t mean you have water. For a country that supports nearly 17% of the world’s population with just 4% of its freshwater resources, water scarcity has become a daily reality, and not just a distant threat.With India’s population expected to rise from 1.3 billion to nearly 1.7 billion by 2050, the question is no longer whether India is facing a water crisis.But how soon parts of the country will run out!A water crisis occurs when the availability of safe, usable water falls short of demand. The World Bank defines water scarcity as a situation where annual per capita water availability drops below 1,000 cubic metres.India is steadily moving towards this threshold.Despite supporting 17% of the world’s population, India has access to only 4% of global freshwater resources. According to NITI Aayog's Composite Water Management Index (CWMI), the country is facing the worst water crisis in its history, with nearly 600 million people experiencing high to extreme water stress.India’s per capita water availability stood at 1,486 cubic metres in 2021, placing it in the water-stressed category (below 1,700 cubic metres). Government estimates suggest this could fall further to 1,341 cubic metres by 2025 and 1,140 cubic metres by 2050, pushing large parts of the country closer to scarcity.Globally, freshwater reserves have declined sharply over the last two decades, with losses estimated at 324 billion cubic metres every year, enough to meet the annual water needs of 280 million people.According to the Union minister of Jal Shakti releases Dynamic Ground Water Resource Assessment Report of the Country for the Year 2025, “Groundwater assessment units across India are categorised as safe, semi critical, critical and over exploited, based on the ratio of annual groundwater extraction and replenishment in the phreatic aquifer. The assigned categories aid in planning, management, and regulation of the country's groundwater resources. ”Water consumption worldwide increased by 25% between 2000 and 2019, with nearly a third of that growth occurring in already water-stressed regions, the report stated.Northern India figures prominently among these drying zones, alongside parts of northern China, Central America and the southwestern United States. Rising temperatures, erratic rainfall, worsening droughts and unsustainable land and water use have accelerated the decline.For India, the implications are stark. Agriculture, livelihoods, urban growth and ecological sustainability all hinge on groundwater, the country’s most heavily used and least regulated water source.Groundwater forms the backbone of India’s water security. According to the 2019 NITI Aayog report, the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB) stated that the contribution of groundwater is nearly 62% in irrigation, 85% in rural water supply and 45% in urban water supply.Yet this invisible lifeline is being drawn down faster than it can be replenished. As per the Dynamic Ground Water Resource Assessment 2025, India’s total annual groundwater recharge stands at 448.52 billion cubic metres (bcm).After accounting for natural discharge, the annual extractable resource is estimated at 407.75 bcm. Current extraction has reached 247.22 bcm, pushing the national stage of groundwater extraction to about 60.6%.While the national average may suggest moderate stress, the reality on the ground is far more uneven.Out of the total 6,762 assessment units, around 25% have been categorised as Overexploited, Critical, or Semi-Critical. These are areas where extraction is approaching or exceeding natural recharge, a warning sign that aquifers are under severe stress.States with the highest proportion of over-exploited and critical units include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Delhi. In Punjab, groundwater extraction stands at over 156% of annual recharge. Rajasthan follows closely at 147%, while Delhi’s extraction level exceeds 90%, placing it in the critical category.Urban centres are not immune.Chennai already experienced ‘day zero’ in June 2019, when all four major reservoirs of the big city reservoirs ran dry. People had to line up for hours to wait for a small allocation of water brought in by trucks from other areas.A BBC report, citing UN projections, ranked Bengaluru second after Brazil’s São Paulo, among 11 global cities at risk of running out of drinking water. As water levels drop and summer temperatures rise, cities are imposing restrictions.Lakhs of residents across the 'city of dreams,' Mumbai are too grappling with acute water scarcity. In Bengaluru, authorities have banned the use of potable water for non-essential activities such as washing cars and watering gardens. Yet questions remain over whether fines and regulations alone can avert a full-blown crisis.In rural areas, the crisis manifests differently, in longer walks for water, abandoned wells and failed crops.Experts point to multiple, interconnected causes:India is the largest user of groundwater in the world, accounting for over 25% of global groundwater extraction. The consequences are severe:Groundwater extraction in India is assessed using data from the Minor Irrigation Census and sample surveys conducted by State Ground Water Departments. According to the National Compilation on Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India, 2025, the country’s total annual groundwater extraction is estimated at 247.22 billion cubic metres (bcm).The agriculture sector remains the largest consumer, accounting for 87% of total extraction, or 215.10 bcm. Domestic use contributes 11% (27.89 bcm), while industrial use accounts for the remaining 2% (4.23 bcm).Water-intensive cropping patterns, such as paddy cultivation in Punjab and Haryana, and it continues to strain aquifers, even in regions where rainfall is relatively adequate. As India’s population grows and incomes rise, food demand is expected to surge.According to the NITI report, India’s population is expected to increase to 1.66 billion by 2050. At the same time, per capita income is estimated to increase by 5.5% per annum. With increasing population and purchasing power, the annual food requirement in the country will exceed 250 million tons by 2050. The total demand for grains will increase to 375 million tons including grain for feeding livestock by 2050.”“This will increase the demand for food. The surge in demand for these water-intensive crops will, ceteris paribus, multiply our current agricultural consumption of water,” it added.Despite a national average that masks local crises, groundwater stress is highly concentrated. More than 25% of administrative units fall under over-exploited, critical or semi-critical categories in nine states and UTs: Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Puducherry.These regions face the highest risk of aquifer depletion, underscoring the urgent need for targeted groundwater management, crop diversification and demand-side interventions.Rainfall remains the primary source of groundwater recharge in India, but its distribution varies widely across regions and seasons. Most of the country receives rainfall during the southwest monsoon, while long dry spells dominate the rest of the year.Groundwater levels typically fall before the monsoon and recover partially during and after it. However, CGWB data shows that in 2024, more than 57% of monitored wells recorded a fall in water levels compared to the previous year, with significant declines observed in states such as Punjab, Rajasthan, Delhi, Maharashtra, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.Geology further complicates the picture.According to the National Compilation on Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India, 2025, Karnataka’s annual groundwater recharge is estimated at 19.27 bcm, while extractable resources stand at 17.41 bcm. While recharge and extractable resources have increased marginally from 2024, extraction has also risen slightly. Overall, the state has seen a modest improvement, with extraction levels dropping from 68.44% in 2024 to 66.49% in 2025.Central Maharashtra, a drought-prone region receiving only 400–700 mm of rainfall annually, remains heavily dependent on groundwater. The state’s annual groundwater recharge is estimated at 33.89 bcm, with extractable resources of 31.99 bcm. Extraction stands at 16.57 bcm, translating to a stage of extraction of 51.79% — a slight improvement from 2024.Punjab remains among the most over-exploited states. Its annual groundwater extraction (26.27 bcm) far exceeds its extractable resource (16.8 bcm), pushing the stage of groundwater extraction to 156.36%.Although extraction has marginally declined from 2024, the state continues to draw far more water than it replenishes, largely due to water-intensive agriculture.Rajasthan’s groundwater situation is similarly alarming. With an annual extraction of 17.10 bcm against extractable resources of 11.62 bcm, the stage of extraction stands at 147.11%. Despite slight improvements in recharge, over-extraction remains entrenched.Delhi’s groundwater extraction stands at 92.10%, placing it in the critical category. While extraction has reduced slightly since 2024, the city remains heavily dependent on groundwater to meet domestic demand.address India’s growing water crisis, the government has rolled out a series of initiatives aimed at conservation, recharge, and equitable access to water. One of the key programmes is the Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), launched in 2019 as a nationwide movement to promote water conservation, groundwater recharge and rainwater harvesting.Another major intervention is the Atal Bhujal Yojana, which emphasises sustainable groundwater management through community participation, improved recharge and regulated extraction.In urban areas, the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) 2.0 supports rainwater harvesting through stormwater drainage systems and promotes groundwater recharge via aquifer management plans.The Centre has also launched the Amrit Sarovar initiative, under which 50,000 water bodies, each roughly one acre in size, are being developed across the country to enhance local water storage and recharge.To improve transparency and monitoring, the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has developed a GIS-based public platform called the India Groundwater Resource Estimation System (IN-GRES). The portal visualises groundwater recharge, extraction, rainfall and categorisation at the level of individual assessment units, allowing comparisons with previous years.Yet, even as policies and programmes expand on paper, a parallel and troubling reality persists.India’s water crisis is not just about scarcity, but governance. Groundwater ownership laws dating back to the Easement Act of 1882 allow landowners to extract water beneath their land with few restrictions.Fragmented water management, weak enforcement and limited public awareness have allowed overuse to continue unchecked.While government initiatives, from the Jal Shakti Abhiyan and Atal Bhujal Yojana to large-scale rainwater harvesting and aquifer mapping programmes, aim to reverse the trend, experts may warn that without behavioural change and strict regulation, these measures may not be enough.Water budgeting, which treats water like a financial account, balancing availability against demand is also increasingly being seen as a crucial tool to identify stressed regions before they reach breaking point.Tankers extract water from over-exploited aquifers, frequently without regulation or quality checks, accelerating depletion while raising concerns over contamination.For now, the scenes of tankers, queues and dried wells serve as a warning. India may not be out of water yet, but in many places, it is running out of time. This underground trade, operating largely unchecked risks pushing India towards a long-term groundwater collapse tomorrow.","Niti aayog has warned that 21 major indian cities face the risk of depleting their groundwater reserves.

NEW DELHI: The India Meteorological Department has issued a red alert for the next 24 hours, warning of dense to very dense fog across large parts of north India, even as air quality in the national capital and surrounding regions remained in the ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ category on Friday.According to the IMD, very dense fog is likely to prevail over Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, with Uttar Pradesh also expected to witness a very cold day. Dense to extremely dense fog has been forecast across Punjab, Uttarakhand and Bihar on December 19 and 20, and over Uttar Pradesh and Haryana during the early morning hours.

Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

NEW DELHI: Advocate Vishnu Joshi, representing a victim’s family in the Goa nightclub fire case, on Wednesday said that one of the Luthra brothers requested a Dunlop mattress during police remand.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before granting custody. Speaking to reporters, he said, “Today, when the Goa Police presented them in court, one accused, during their arguments, claimed he had spinal issues and other health problems. He requested that they be provided with a Dunlop mattress during their police remand. The state strongly opposed this... Their pre-medical examination showed them to be perfectly fit. ”He added that the duo had attempted to evade legal proceedings since fleeing India.“Since these people (Luthra brothers) absconded and fled the country, they have been employing tactics to somehow escape. First, they filed an anticipatory bail application on vague grounds in the Rohini Court, even though that court had no jurisdiction... But that bail application was rejected. Since then, they have been trying wherever they get a chance to obtain some kind of relaxation,” Joshi said.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before ordering custody.“The brothers claimed to be suffering from back pain. The court considered all submissions and directed the police to first conduct a pre-medical examination and re-examination. No medical necessity was found, following which the court, exercising its full authority, granted five days of police remand,” he said.The Luthra brothers, owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, were remanded to five-day police custody by the Mapusa Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) court.They were brought back to Goa from Thailand following their deportation and produced before the court after undergoing multiple medical examinations.After landing at Manohar International Airport, Mopa, under police escort around 10.45 am, the duo was taken to a primary health centre in Siolim and then to the District Hospital in Mapusa. The court directed fresh medical examinations before ordering the five-day custody to allow investigators to question them regarding alleged safety lapses at the club.The blaze broke out on December 6 around 11.45 pm during a crowded event at the nightclub, when electric firecrackers allegedly struck the wooden ceiling. The incident claimed the lives of 25 people, including tourists and staff, while several others were injured.Police said the brothers fled India hours after the incident on December 7, leaving for Thailand while rescue operations were under way. Goa Police launched a nationwide and international manhunt, issued a lookout circular and sought an Interpol Blue Notice.Following their detention by Thai authorities for illegal stay and the suspension of their passports, the brothers were deported to India on emergency travel documents.They landed at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport on Tuesday and were arrested by Goa Police, who obtained a 48-hour transit remand from a Delhi court to facilitate their return to Goa.They have been booked under several provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder and negligence. Investigators have also arrested several others linked to the nightclub’s operations and are probing allegations that the venue was operating with expired licences and without mandatory safety clearances.","Advocate vishnu joshi, representing victim's family, says one of the luthra brothers requested a dunlop mattress during police remand.

NEW DELHI: The string of landmark judgments on gender equality could not help Shyla Joseph get an equitable 1/9th share of the property of her father N S Sreedharan, who had nine children but in his will disinherited her for marrying outside the community.A Supreme Court bench of Justices Ahsanuddin Amanullah and K Vinod Chandran reversed the concurrent findings of the HC and the trial court which had doubted the will and allowed equitable partition of Sreedharan's property among the nine children, including Shyla.Writing the judgment, Justice Chandran said, ""There can be no interference to the will which stands proved unequivocally. The judgment and decree of the high court and that of the trial court stands set aside. The plaintiff (Shyla) is found to have no claim over the properties of her father, which by a will have been bequeathed to the other siblings of the plaintiff.""Once the SC doubted the claim, senior advocate P B Krishnan, appearing for Shyla, requested the bench that her entitlement at best was just 1/9th share of her father's assets which is a negligible portion of the properties.The bench said the question of equality does not arise in a case relating to the wish of a man about division and inheritance of his properties.It said, ""We are not on equity, and the wish of the testator assumes pre-eminence. The last will and testament of the testator cannot be digressed from or frustrated."" While allowing the appeal of her siblings, the bench ordered dismissal of the suit she had filed for equitable partition of her father's properties.It said the rule of prudence cannot apply to the contents of a will, which is the wish of the individual who has absolute discretion to divide his properties. If all siblings had been divested of their inheritance through a will, then the rule of prudence could have been applied by the courts, the bench said.Referring to the reason for which Sreedharan had disinherited Shyla, the SC said, ""There is a reason stated for such exclusion, the acceptability of which to our minds, is not what the rule of prudence dictates. We cannot put the testator in our shoes... We cannot substitute our opinions in place of that of the testator; his desire prompted by his own justifications.""",Shyla joseph was disinherited by her father n s sreedharan for marrying outside the community.

On July 24, it told the Upper House that there is “no conclusive data available to establish a direct correlation of death exclusively by air pollution”.The ministry had said, “Air pollution is one of the many factors affecting respiratory ailments and associated diseases. Health is impacted by a number of factors which include food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity etc. of the individuals apart from the environment.” A similar answer was given by the ministry on the issue on July 25 last year in the Rajya Sabha.The ministry’s response on Thursday came to a question by BJP member Laxmikant Bajpayee, who asked whether the govt was aware that studies and medical tests have confirmed that prolonged exposure to hazardous AQI levels in Delhi-NCR is leading to lung fibrosis, an irreversible reduction in lung capacity. He also sought to know whether lung elasticity among citizens of Delhi-NCR has drastically reduced to almost 50% compared to people living in cities with good AQI levels.The BJP Rajya Sabha MP further asked whether the govt has any “solution to save millions of residents of Delhi/NCR from growing deadly diseases like pulmonary fibrosis, COPD, emphysema, reduced lung function and continuously declining lung elasticity”.The ministry in its reply said dedicated training modules have been developed in the area of air pollution for programme managers, medical officers and nurses, nodal officers, sentinel sites, frontline workers such as ASHA, vulnerable groups including women and children, and occupationally exposed groups like traffic police and municipal workers.It said, “Information, education and communication (IEC) materials have been developed targeting air pollution related illnesses in both English, Hindi and also regional languages.“The National Programme on Climate Change and Human Health (NPCCHH) has also developed customized IEC materials targeting various vulnerable groups such as school children, women, occupational vulnerable groups like municipality workers, etc.”",The union environment ministry underlined that air pollution is “one of the triggering factors for respiratory ailments and associated diseases” the ministry’s response was in line with comments in past years on linkages between health issues and air pollution.
