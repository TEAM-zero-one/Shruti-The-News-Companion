What is 3-language formula?



NEW DELHI: Continuing his alleged anti-Hindu imposition tirade, Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Friday called the Centre's three-language formula under the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020 a "" Hindi colonialism "".Stalin, in a post he wrote in English, said Tamil Nadu will not tolerate ""Hindi colonialism"" replacing ""British colonialism"".""History is clear. Those who tried to impose Hindi on Tamil Nadu have either been defeated or later changed their stance and aligned with DMK . Tamil Nadu will not tolerate Hindi colonialism replacing British colonialism,"" he wrote.The Tamil Nadu also CM mocked the state BJP's signature campaign in the NEP's favour, challenging the rival party to contest the next year's assembly elections on the same issue.""Now the BJPâ€™s circus-like signature campaign for the three-language formula has become a laughing stock in Tamil Nadu. I challenge them to make this their core agenda in the 2026 Assembly elections and let it be a referendum on Hindi imposition ,"" Stalin wrote on X.The DMK boss also hit out at the Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan ""for reviving a fight he can never win"".""The tree may prefer calm, but the wind will not subside."" It was the Union Education Minister who provoked us to write this series of letters when we were simply doing our job. He forgot his place and dared to threaten an entire state to accept #HindiImposition, and now he faces the consequences of reviving a fight he can never win. Tamil Nadu will not be blackmailed into surrendering,"" Stalin wrote.Highlighting the names of Union government's schemes, institutions and awards, Stalin said Hindi has been ""imposed to a nauseating extent, suffocating non-Hindi speakers, who are the majority in India"".""Men may come, men may go. But even long after the dominance of Hindi is shattered in India, history will remember that it was DMK that stood as the vanguard,"" he wrote.On Thursday, Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai claimed that over one lakh people across the state have supported the BJP's online campaign on the three-language policy. He added that his party would continue its outreach despite police action, questioning how many people the government could ""illegally arrest"".Countering Stalin's ""Hindi imposition"" claims, Annamalai claimed that in the matriculation schools run by Stalin's party men have not even made Tamil a compulsory subject.""Having realised that the opposition to the three-language policy hasn't yielded support from the common people, Thiru @mkstalin has now jumped to the imaginary Hindi imposition,"" he added.The three-language formula under the NEP 2020 promotes multilingualism while ensuring flexibility in language learning. It mandates that students learn three languages, with at least two being Indian languages, though the choice of languages is left to states and schools.The policy encourages the mother tongue or regional language as the medium of instruction at least until class 5, preferably until class 8 and beyond. While it allows English as an option, it does not impose any particular language, emphasising state autonomy in language selection. Despite its flexible approach, states like Tamil Nadu oppose the policy, fearing it could lead to the imposition of Hindi over regional languages.","Stalin says tamil nadu will not tolerate ""hindi colonialism"" replacing british colonialism.

RSS neta sparks Maha row with remark on Marathi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rss-neta-sparks-maha-row-with-remark-on-marathi/articleshow/118770029.cms,"Photo/Agencies

MUMBAI: Senior RSS leader Bhaiyyaji Joshi 's remark at a function in Ghatkopar that knowing Marathi was not necessary to live in Mumbai stirred a political controversy on Thursday, with the opposition MVA criticising him strongly and demanding to know if the state govt agreed with him. While CM Devendra Fadnavis said in response that Marathi is the language of Mumbai and Maharashtra and anyone who lives here should learn and speak it, Joshi himself said later that his comment had been misconstrued and that ""Marathi is a part of the state's culture and identity, and it is the duty of every citizen to learn it.""Speaking at a programme on Wednesday evening, Joshi said those coming to Mumbai need not learn Marathi. He also said Gujarati is ""the language of Ghatkopar.""The statements invited criticism from the Shiv Sena (UBT) and Congress. Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray demanded Joshi be booked for treason for his remarks, and in the state assembly, and the party's MLA Bhaskar Jadhav sought an explanation from the govt. NCP (SP) MLA Rohit Pawar said, ""The language of Mumbai is Marathi"" and demanded the govt state its stance on the controversy. In the legislative council, opposition leader Ambadas Danve attacked the govt, asking it, ""Do you endorse Bhaiyyaji Joshi's statement?"" The council was adjourned for ten minutes as opposition MLCs demanded that chairman Ram Shinde accept their demand for a discussion on the issue. When the House reassembled, Congress' Bhai Jagtap slammed the govt, stating it seemed to have forgotten the ""Hutatmas"" who sacrificed their lives for formation of the state on linguistic lines. Later, opposition MLCs staged a walkout in protest.In the afternoon, Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray went to Hutatma Chowk with all his MLAs and MLCs to protest Joshi's statement.Following the uproar, Joshi issued a video statement. He said, ""Due to one of my statements, a misunderstanding occurred. There is no question of the language of Mumbai not being Marathi. The language of Maharashtra is Marathi. Mumbai is in Maharashtra, and naturally, the language of Mumbai is Marathi. Different languages are spoken in India. People speaking different languages live in Mumbai as well. So, it is a natural expectation that they should also come here and learn Marathi, understand Marathi, and read Marathi. I think that this is a great example of coexistence, that people speaking so many different languages in India live together. I think that Mumbai is also an ideal example of this. But there is a natural expectation that a person coming to Mumbai should understand Marathi, speak Marathi, learn Marathi, and read Marathi. This is the only expectation. I have nothing more to say than this... My mother tongue is Marathi. But I also respect the existence of all languages... I request everyone to see it from the same perspective.""Fadnavis said in the assembly, ""I haven't heard what Bhaiyyaji said, but the language of Mumbai and Maharashtra is Marathi.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday announced that they have launched a campaign to restore the villages that were evacuated during the India-China war of 1962 and said that people have forgotten the time when it happened but he didn't.At a public gathering in Harsil, PM Modi discussed two villages in Uttarkashi district that were evacuated in 1962. He outlined plans to transform these locations into prominent tourist attractions.""People might know that when China attacked India in 1962, these two villages of ours were evacuated. People have forgotten, but we cannot forget.

NEW DELHI: For 15 years, Shiwam Kumar Srivastava fought not just for a job, but for the right to be seen. He had cleared the UPSC exams in 2008, ranking high enough for selection.But when the final list came out, his name wasn't on it. No explanation. No rejection letter. Just silence - a quiet, deliberate erasure.Shiwam took the fight all the way to the Supreme Court , which in July 2024 finally ordered the Union govt to appoint him. By then, his batchmates had spent 15 years rising through the ranks. Some were joint secretaries. Shiwam, at 46, was just starting.""The order came seven months ago, but I haven't celebrated yet. I haven't even told my relatives,"" he said from his third-floor apartment in Rohini, Delhi. Shiwam is with the Indian Information Service now.The Persons with Disabilities (PwD) Act, 1995 guaranteed visually impaired candidates a fair chance in the civil services, but laws mean nothing when those enforcing them choose to look the other way. Vacancies were left unfilled. Legal protections were ignored. His rightful selection was buried in paperwork. Justice delayed wasn't just justice denied, it was a career cancelled before it had even begun.For years, every small victory has been followed by another setback. Even now, with his post in Indian Information Service (IIS) finally secured, he remains wary. ""This fight was never just about me. It was about proving that people like me deserve a place in this system - even when the system refuses to see us.""The Supreme Court's order, invoking Article 142, had directed the Union govt to place him in Indian Revenue Service or any other suitable service. He was eventually allotted IIS, but the victory was bitter. Bureaucratic blindness had cost him the prime years of his career - something no court ruling could restore.His legal battle began in 2009, when he and fellow candidate Pankaj Srivastava discovered that UPSC had left vacancies for visually impaired candidates unfilled from 1996 to 2005. They challenged this in the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), which ruled in their favour in 2012. The Union govt appealed in the Delhi high court, which upheld their case in 2013. Even then, the Centre dragged the matter to the Supreme Court, where it remained stuck for a decade. Hearings stretched from 2014 to 2024, while his career remained frozen in time.""There were three others like me. After the 2008 results, we found that our UPSC scores were higher than those selected for various services. Yet, despite clearing our interviews, we were never recommended,"" he said. The authorities never said it outright, but the message was clear: blind officers had no place in the govt.Before his IIS appointment, Shiwam had worked in the judiciary for two decades, first as a junior assistant clerk at the Rohini court in 2003, then as a senior judicial assistant officer. Even there, he had faced the same structural resistance. Promotions were rare for disabled employees, and he remained stuck in the same pay grade for years - not because he lacked ability, but because the system didn't believe he deserved more.Now, six months into his new job as an assistant director in the ministry of information & broadcasting, he commutes 60km daily in an auto-rickshaw to the Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC), where he is undergoing two years of induction training. ""I will get perks, including a car, only after the training is over and I receive a posting,"" he said.Shiwam had learned early what it meant to be overlooked. Born in Motihari, Bihar, in 1978, he had been a topper in school, when at 17 his world collapsed. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a rare genetic disorder, snatched away his sight permanently. His father took him to every specialist imaginable, but nothing worked. For five years, he clung to hope - yoga, meditation, alternative medicine - but by 2001, he had to accept reality.Determined to rebuild his life, he moved to Delhi, where he trained at All India Confederation Of The Blind (AICB) and National Institute for the Empowerment of Persons with Visual Disabilities (NIEPVD), Dehradun. There, he discovered text-to-speech software like GAWS and NVDA, which allowed him to scan, digitise, and listen to books, a tool that became his lifeline in UPSC preparation.In 2016, he married Pushpanjali Rani, who never doubted his ability to achieve his dreams. ""'Impossible' is not in his dictionary. Nothing can stop him,"" she said. They now have two daughters, aged 7 and 2. His resilience has inspired many, including Sunil Kumar, a judicial officer at Tis Hazari Court, who credits him with pushing for major workplace reforms.","Shiwam kumar srivastava fought not just for a job, but for the right to be seen.

Bhagwant Mann vs farmers: Is AAP rethinking its strategy in Punjab?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bhagwant-mann-vs-farmers-is-aap-rethink-its-strategy-in-punjab/articleshow/118759733.cms,"AAPâ€™s political setback and Kejriwalâ€™s absence



NEW DELHI: Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann is taking the farmers head-on, accusing them of ""turning Punjab into a state of protests."" The foiled Chandigarh agitation has now become the latest flashpoint in the escalating standoff.On Wednesday, farmers who had set out in tractors and other vehicles were stopped at multiple entry points, leading to heightened tensions between the protesters and the government.A day earlier, Bhagwant Mann had walked out of a crucial meeting with farm leaders midway, further deepening the confrontation. As protesting farmers were halted, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) issued a direct warning to Mann, stating that his government ""will not have enough jails if the farmers of Punjab decide to court arrest to protect the democratic rights of the people.""The latest showdown has provided fresh ammunition to opposition parties, including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has accused the AAP government of ""insulting the annadatas (food providers).""For a party that rode to power in Punjab with the support of farmers â€” who protested for months against the Centre's farm bills at Delhiâ€™s borders â€” this apparent U-turn has been striking. The Mann government now finds its relationship with the farming community severely strained.Speaking to the media, Mann defended his stance, stating that his government had to balance the interests of all Punjabis, not just farmers.""I am the custodian of not just the farmers but of Punjabâ€™s 3.5 crore people. The protests were causing inconvenience to traders, businessmen, students, and employees,"" Mann said.The confrontation with farmers comes just days after AAP lost its stronghold in Delhi, allowing the BJP to stage a major comeback in the recent Delhi assembly elections.Adding to the political turmoil, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has not been seen in public since the election results were announced. Though he traveled to Punjab for a 10-day Vipassana meditation camp, what grabbed attention was his high-profile convoy.The opposition targeted the Punjab government over Kejriwalâ€™s 21-vehicle cavalcade, which included Punjab Police personnel, accusing him of hypocrisy. The BJP, which successfully countered Kejriwalâ€™s â€˜aam aadmiâ€™ (common man) narrative in Delhi with allegations of extravagant spending on â€˜Sheesh Mahalâ€™ (glass palace),claimed his Punjab retreat was simply an excuse to enjoy a lavish lifestyle.The Delhi assembly results marked AAPâ€™s second major setback, following its poor performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, where it won only three out of 13 parliamentary seats in Punjab. This was in stark contrast to its landslide victory in the 2022 Punjab Assembly elections, where the party won 92 out of 117 seats.The Delhi election results were also seen as a reflection of Mannâ€™s popularity. Despite active campaigning by Mann, his cabinet ministers, MPs, and MLAs, the party failed to improve its standing in the national capital.With Punjab assembly elections just two years away, Mannâ€™s tougher stance on farmers will be closely watched, as it may determine AAPâ€™s future in the state.","Punjab chief minister bhagwant mann accuses farmers of ""turning punjab into a state of protests"" chandigarh agitation has now become the latest flashpoint in the escalating standoff.

KOLKATA: Calcutta HC advised Bengal governor CV Ananda Bose and CM Mamata Banerjee on Thursday to have a "" chai pe charcha "" to resolve their differences, saying ""it isn't a good example"" for the public to witness a legal battle involving Raj Bhavan and the state government.Justice Krishna Rao, who was hearing the state's petition challenging an interim directive restraining it from making any statement against the governor, extended the gag order till April 10.The case dates back to July 2023, when Bose filed a defamation case against Mamata and three others - MLAs Sayantika Banerjee and Reyat Hossain Sarkar, and former MP Kunal Ghosh - over what he said was ""personal imputation"" in public. The governor soughtRs 11 crore in damages along with an order barring the respondents from allegedly maligning him. Bose specifically objected to Mamata's purported remark that ""women fear to enter Raj Bhavan"" in Kolkata, alluding to allegations against the governor that he molested a former member of his staff.Later that month, the court restrained the three from ""making any defamatory or incorrect statement"" against the governor. It said Bose had prima facie made a case for an interim restraint order. Mamata challenged this order on the ground that ""justifiable criticism"" wasn't libel, and that the gag order curbed her fundamental right to free speech as a citizen and an elected representative.The matter is slated to come up for hearing next on April 9.","Calcutta hc advised bengal governor cv ananda bose and cm mamata banerjee to have a "" chai pe charcha "" the case dates back to july 2023, when bose filed a defamation case against mamata and three others over what he said was ""personal imputation""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118769554,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-895396,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

JAIPUR/AJMER: Rajasthan high court barred Bijaynagar Municipality in Beawar on Thursday from bulldozing properties linked to suspects in the gangrape and blackmail cases involving five schoolgirls, taking cognisance of allegations that the state govt was ""hell-bent"" on demolitions in contravention of Supreme Court guidelines .Justice Mahendar Goyal's order to maintain status quo came on a petition filed by five people who received demolition notices issued on Feb 20 for alleged violations under sections 194 and 245 of the Rajasthan Municipality Act.Syed Saadat Ali, counsel for the petitioners, accused the administration of overlooking responses to the demolition notices.Ali cited SC guidelines mandating inspections before any demolition and a signed endorsement of any such action by two elected representatives. These safeguards are meant to ensure that ""only unauthorised and non-compoundable constructions are targeted"", he said.The court directed the lawyer to provide a copy of the writ petition to additional advocate general GS Gill and scheduled the next hearing for March 11.Eleven suspects have been arrested and three juveniles detained since three FIRs were registered on Feb 16, based on complaints by the families of the schoolgirls.",Rajasthan high court barred bijaynagar municipality in beawar from bulldozing properties linked to suspects in the gangrape and blackmail cases.

Biryani bone stuck in throat triggers 8-hour OT drama,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/biryani-bone-stuck-in-throat-triggers-8-hour-ot-drama/articleshow/118769427.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: A dinner treat turned into a misadventure for Kurla's Shaikh family. On Feb 3, Ruby Shaikh (name changed), a 34-year-old mother of two, was enjoying a rare treat - chicken biryani from a local restaurant. Little did she know that a chicken bone would take her on a month-long medical journey that would perplex even doctors.The modestly priced biryani left Ruby's husband, a supervisor in a local factory, with an Rs 8 lakh bill, although the hospital later halved it through donations.The 3.2cm bone that damaged Ruby's oesophagus was extracted on Feb 8. But when doctors at Criticare Asia Hospital began the throat procedure, it vanished from its initial position. X-ray and ultrasound examinations couldn't find it in the chest or abdomen. A CT scan, performed while the patient was intubated, revealed its unexpected upward movement to the nasopharynx, the topmost part of the throat. The operation lasted eight hours instead of two.Immediately after choking on Feb 3, Ruby arrived at Criticare Hospital where an X-ray scan showed a foreign object in her neck. She refused CT scans and admission but returned two days later with fever, high blood pressure, and oral infection. This time, through endoscopy and CT scans, doctors found the foreign body in the cervical oesophagus, having caused bilateral perforations.ENT surgeon Dr Sanjay Helale said, ""Scans before surgery revealed the bone was still in the earlier position."" He chose an open surgery as the bone was close to the carotid artery to the brain and the patient's perforated food pipe needed repair. ""Perhaps due to manipulations of the oesophagus during dissection or the effect of anaesthesia, the bone moved upward.""Dr Ajay Bhandarwar, head of the surgery dept at J J Hospital, said the movement from the food pipe back to the throat was unusual.Former KEM Hospital Dean Dr Avinash Supe suggested: ""One can presume the patient coughed immediately after anaesthesia was given and necrosis set in the infected tissues loosened the bone, resulting in upward migration.""Ruby, meanwhile, says she will neither eat nor cook biryani.","Ruby shaikh, a 34-year-old mother of two, was enjoying a rare treat - chicken biryani from a local restaurant.

NEW DELHI: Observing that preventive detention is a draconian measure whereby a person can be detained without conviction, Supreme Court has held that such orders must reflect an independent application of mind by the detaining authority , and a mere statement that it's ""satisfied on examination of the proposals and supporting documents"" is not sufficient.Quashing a detention order passed by the home department of Nagaland government, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and Augustine George Masih said that the detaining authority, special secretary (home department), did not even make separate grounds of detention but merely acted upon the proposals for detention forwarded to her by the additional director general of police, which is not valid.""The cryptic orders of detention passed by her (special secretary) merely recorded that she was satisfied, on careful examination of such proposals and other supporting documents, that sufficient grounds were made out for the detention of Ashraf Hussain Choudhary and Adaliu Chawang. This is not in keeping with the statutory scheme, inasmuch as Section 6 of the Act ( Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act ) specifically refers to the order of detention 'being made' on separate grounds,"" the court said.""Further, Section 3(1) also records that the authorised officer, be it of the central govt or of a state govt, must be 'satisfied' that the person concerned required to be detained so as to prevent him/her from engaging in illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. Such 'satisfaction' of the detaining authority necessarily has to be spelt out after application of mind by way of separate grounds of detention made by the detaining authority itself and cannot be by inference from a casual reference to the material placed before such detaining authority or a bald recital to the effect that the detaining authority was 'satisfied on examination of the proposals and supporting documents' that the detention of the individuals concerned was necessary,"" it said.","Supreme court quashes a detention order passed by the home department of nagaland government.

Chennai: Enforcement Directorate began searches Thursday at places linked to Tamil Nadu electricity and prohibition and excise minister V Senthil Balaji in Chennai and Karur, as well as at offices of Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation and breweries and distilleries supplying it.Though ED did not reveal the basis for the searches, sources said it had registered a fresh case based on multiple FIRs registered by DVAC from 2016 to 2021 on seizures of unaccounted cash from Tasmac outlets. ""The suspicion is that this unaccounted cash is being used for money laundering .

""Tasmac's procurement of liquor should be based on the three-month weighted average (average sales of a particular brand).

NEW DELHI: Observing that ""over-solicitous homage"" to the accused's liberty can, sometimes, defeat the cause of public justice, Supreme Court has said that anticipatory bail should be granted only in exceptional cases, particularly when an accused is alleged to be involved in corruption.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said corruption in the higher echelons of govt and political parties was the biggest menace which could lead to economic unrest and underscored that courts should not hesitate to deny liberty to an accused in such cases in order to ensure a corruption-free society .""The presumption of innocence, by itself, cannot be the sole consideration for grant of anticipatory bail. The presumption of innocence is one of the considerations, which the court should keep in mind while considering the plea for anticipatory bail. The salutary rule is to balance the cause of the accused and the cause of public justice. Over-solicitous homage to the accused's liberty can, sometimes, defeat the cause of public justice,"" the bench said.The court passed the order while rejecting anticipatory bail plea of a public servant who was alleged to have demanded illegal gratification in connection with audit of development work undertaken by a gram panchayat. It said Law Commission in its 41st report recommended introduction of a provision for grant of anticipatory bail where it said that ""power to grant anticipatory bail should be exercised in very exceptional cases"".""If liberty is to be denied to an accused to ensure corruption free society, then courts should not hesitate in denying such liberty. Where overwhelming considerations in the nature aforesaid require denial of anticipatory bail, it has to be denied. It is altogether a different thing to say that once probe is over and chargesheet is filed, court may consider to grant regular bail to a public servant accused of indulging in corruption,"" SC said.Stating that parameters for grant of anticipatory bail in a serious offence like corruption were required to be satisfied, the bench said, ""Anticipatory bail can be granted only in exceptional circumstances where court is prima facie of view that applicant has been falsely roped into the crime or allegations are politically motivated or frivolous. So far as the case at hand is concerned, it cannot be said that any exceptional circumstances have been made out by the petitioner for grant of anticipatory bail and there is no frivolity in the prosecution,"" it said.Highlighting the problem of corruption in society, the court said, ""If one is asked to name one sole factor that effectively arrested the progress of our society to prosperity, undeniably it is corruption.""","Supreme court said that ""over-solicitous homage"" to the accused's liberty can, sometimes, defeat the cause of public justice.

L&T introduces one-day menstrual leave per month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lt-introduces-one-day-menstrual-leave-per-month/articleshow/118769276.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: In a first of sorts for the engineering and construction industry, Larsen & Toubro chairman S N Subrahmanyan introduced a one-day menstrual leave facility every month for the company's women staff.The announcement came during Women's Day celebrations at the Powai office in Mumbai where the chairman addressed 350 women employees.The organisation's workforce of 60,000 includes about 5,000 women employees, representing 9% of total staff. The policy excludes L&T's non-construction and non-engineering businesses such as financial and technology services. That's because these businesses have work-from-home and flexible work arrangements, while the main L&T operations have an office-based working policy.The menstrual leave provision is a pioneering step for a progressive workplace policy in the industry that L&T operates in.Thursday's announcement follows Subrahmanyan's earlier contentious statement suggesting a 90-hour work week for employees while also expressing disappointment about the inability to implement working on Sundays.Specific details regarding the implementation of the 12-day annual menstrual leave policy remain undetermined, including its commencement date, and whether it constitutes additional paid leave beyond existing entitlements and the permissible timing within the menstrual cycle.While India lacks national legislation on menstrual leave, several organisations such as AU Small Finance Bank, Orient Electric (part of CK Birla Group), Swiggy and Zomato and states like Odisha, Bihar and Kerala have independently adopted such a policy to support women's health and well-being. A proposed bill addressing women's rights to menstrual leave and free menstrual products awaits enactment.According to KS Legal and Associates' managing partner Sonam Chandwani, despite positive intentions behind menstrual leave policies, practical issues exist. ""While it recognises biological differences and supports workplace inclusivity , it could unintentionally reinforce gender biases. Employers might hesitate to hire or promote women in roles requiring continuous availability, fearing additional leave requirements like maternity leaves. This could set back workplace equality,"" she said.","The announcement came during women's day celebrations at the powai office in mumbai.
