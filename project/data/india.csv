NAGPUR: Red fury has turned inward. The central committee of the banned CPI (Maoist) has lashed out at its own politburo senior Mallojula Venugopal Rao, alias Bhupathi or Sonu, branding him a ""revolutionary traitor"" and ""counter-revolutionary"" for allegedly engineering a ""historic betrayal"" - the mass surrender of 61 Maoist cadres in Maharashtra's Gadchiroli on Oct 15.That surrender, hailed by Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis as the ""beginning of the end"" of Naxalism, saw 50 weapons handed to security forces. In a press release dated Oct 16, the Maoists condemned it as a ""party-breaking act"" that returned ""lethal tools to the enemy"".Bhupathi's public defection has triggered a storm inside the outlawed outfit's top brass. The Maoist central committee, led by its elusive leadership under the pseudonym Abhay, expelled Bhupathi, Vivek (a Dandakaranya special zone committee member), Deepa, and 10 divisional committee members, calling on ""revolutionary masses"" to deliver ""appropriate punishment"".Yet, in a contradictory tone, the committee extended an olive branch to the surrendered cadres: ""We assure them that such people will pose no threat and can return to the party."" It warned Bhupathi and Satish - Dandakaranya commander Rupesh alias Takkalapalli Vasudev Rao, who led another mass surrender of 210 PLGA fighters in Chhattisgarh - to stop ""counter-revolutionary activities"" allegedly carried out under govt intelligence patronage. Security agencies view the fiery denunciation as a desperate attempt to stem collapsing morale.","Bhupathi's public defection has triggered a storm inside the outlawed outfit's top brass.

"Gujarat, Maharashtra fishermen lead in installing space-tech transponders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarat-maharshtra-fishermen-lead-in-installing-space-tech-transponders/articleshow/124820867.cms,"Representational image

NEW DELHI: Gujarat and Maharashtra have taken the lead among 13 coastal states and Union Territories in installing indigenous transponders, a tracking device guided by space technology, in marine fishing vessels. The devices are being used for transmitting real-time weather alerts and disaster warnings such as cyclones, monitoring, control and surveillance.The effectiveness of the high-tech transponders in saving lives and properties of thousands of fishermen was proved successfully when it guided 686 marine fishing vessels of Tamil Nadu back to safe harbour during two well-marked low-pressure systems early this week.Disaster management authorities are now confident of saving lives of fishermen during any future cyclonic events, including the upcoming one - cyclone named 'Montha' - that is predicted to hit Andhra Pradesh coast on Oct 28. Its first successful test-case in a limited way was, however, in Odisha where the alerts sent through the transponders had saved the lives of many fishermen who were out in the high seas during Cyclone Dana in Oct last year.More than 41,700 transponders have been installed in marine vessels across all coastal states/UTs ever since the installation began in Aug last year with Gujarat installing the highest number at 15,486 followed by Maharashtra (8,773), Tamil Nadu (3,884), Karnataka (3,773), Andhra Pradesh (3,490), Odisha (1,707) and Kerala (1,551) as on Oct 24. Govt is supplying these devices free of cost to the fishermen with a 60: 40 funding pattern between Centre and states, and 100% central share for UTs.""The transponders, developed by ISRO using its vessel communication and support system (VCSS) and operationalised by NewSpace India Ltd, are also quite critical from a security point of view as they can track routes of fishing vessels, enabling fishermen to understand the limits of legal fishing areas clearly. In case of any suspicious activities, the security agencies will be able to inspect the vessels,"" said an official.It's a two-way communication system enabling fishermen to send short messages using their phone while fishing up to 200 nautical miles from the coast covering entire Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). In case the fishermen cross Maritime Boundary Line, alerts are sent to avoid unintentional transgression. Information related to Potential Fishing Zones is also made available on their mobiles.A national fisheries application named as 'Nabhmitra' is being used to push real-time, targeted advisories and mass alerts directly to vessels equipped with transponders. It has been designed to provide access to all features in the regional languages. It also has efficient harbour management tools like a token system for entry and exit of fishing vessels for voyages enabling the boat owner to enter crew and vessel details.""In view to establish traceability of fish catch, which is essential for compliance to international guidelines of 'illegal, unreported and unregulated’ (IUU) fishing, provisions for entry with geolocation are also being made,"" said the officialCurrently, a few EU nations, China, the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, South Africa and Chile are using such high-tech transponders on fishing vessels to enhance safety, improve monitoring, and combat illegal fishing.“The successful use of indigenous transponders during the recent twin low-pressure systems stands as a shining example of how India’s technological ingenuity can directly safeguard lives at sea. By blending space-based innovation with grassroots connectivity, the VCSS has transformed how coastal safety is managed-turning real-time data into decisive action,” said the official.","Gujarat and maharashtra have taken the lead among 13 coastal states and union territories in installing indigenous transponders in marine fishing vessels.

Maharashtra doctor suicide case: Pune techie Prashant Bankar arrested,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/maharashtra-doctor-suicide-case-pune-techie-prashant-bankar-arrested/articleshow/124799223.cms,"Representative Image





NEW DELHI: Maharashtra police on Saturday arrested Prashant Bankar, one of two individuals accused in connection with the suicide of a woman doctor in Phaltan taluka, Satara district.According to news agency ANI, Bankar will be produced in court today. The other accused sub-inspector Gopal Badne, is still absconding.A doctor posted at Phaltan subdistrict hospital was found dead in a hotel room on Thursday evening, officials said.She had checked into the hotel late Wednesday night, as her rented accommodation was far from the hospital.Hotel staff found her body after she failed to respond to repeated knocks.In a note reportedly written on her palm, the doctor accused sub-inspector Gopal Badane of repeated sexual assault and software engineer Prashant Bankar, her landlord’s son, of mental harassment.Satara police have registered a case of abetment of suicide against both.According to a statement the doctor allegedly submitted to an internal inquiry committee, she faced ongoing intimidation and harassment from police officials.She claimed she was pressured to alter post-mortem and medical reports and taunted over prior crimes reported in her home district of Beed.One alleged incident involved police forcing her to declare a high-blood-pressure patient fit for custody and taking the patient away without proper treatment. Despite submitting a written complaint to the deputy superintendent of police in June, she claimed no action was taken.Satara police said the doctor had been in a five-month relationship with Bankar, which later turned sour. Her interactions with the sub-inspector were linked to her hospital duties, as she often conducted medical examinations for suspects in custody. Badane is currently absconding.“We have suspended him and formed a special team to trace and arrest him and the other suspect,” said Inspector General Sunil Phulari.Political leaders have demanded a swift and independent probe. NCP leader Dhananjay Munde called for a special investigation team (SIT) and a fast-track trial, saying ignoring her complaints due to her Beed origin would be a grave injustice. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Ambadas Danve demanded that officials from outside Satara conduct the inquiry, calling the suicide “a case where protectors turned predators.”Relatives said the doctor had repeatedly complained about police harassment and pressure to alter reports. Activist Nitin Andhale shared her purported statement online, highlighting the alleged inaction and intimidation that may have contributed to her death.Satara superintendent of police Tushar Doshi confirmed that her complaints, including WhatsApp messages, were used to file FIRs under sections 64 (rape) and 108 (abetment of suicide) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.A civil surgeon-led inquiry panel is being set up to determine if hospital authorities acted on her complaints.Civil Surgeon Yuvraj Karape said the doctor had joined the hospital on contract and was nearing the end of her second 11-month term.She often stayed at the hotel after late-night duties, and authorities are examining all complaints regarding alleged police interference in hospital work.","Police arrest prashant bankar, one of two individuals accused in connection with the suicide of a woman doctor in satara district.

""Congress Only Party To Respect Him..."" Pappu Yadav Alleges BJP Sidelining Nitish Kumar in NDA

Poll Do you believe Nitish Kumar's return to NDA is a positive move for Bihar? Yes, it's a great decision No, it's not beneficial

NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), saying he had joined the party “because of circumstances.” Reaffirming his commitment to the NDA , he said he is “back in NDA for good.” He also criticised the RJD’s rule before his 20-year tenure as chief minister, saying, “pehle bahut bura haal tha,” and highlighted the shortcomings of the Lalu-Rabri governments, taking aim at their administration.Addressing his first election rally in Minapur, Muzaffarpur, Kumar took a dig at his rival Lalu Prasad and said, “Because of circumstances, I had to tie up with those people, but it did not take me long to realise that they were good for nothing. Now I am back (in NDA) for good.”Kumar recalled that his earlier alliances with the RJD in 2015 and 2022 both lasted less than two years. On both occasions, Lalu’s son Tejashwi Yadav, now leader of the opposition in Vidhan Sabha, served as his deputy chief minister.He highlighted his government’s focus on improving infrastructure, education, and healthcare in Bihar, and praised the Narendra Modi government at the Centre for its support.Talking about law and order, Kumar said, “An atmosphere of terror had prevailed in Bihar because of poor law and order and alleged patronage to criminals by the powers that be, until I took over. But now, it is for all to see how much things have changed.”He added that communal harmony has also improved. “Even disputes between Hindus and Muslims have come down because we were sensitive to needs like fencing of religious places of both faiths,” he said.Taking a swipe at Lalu Prasad, Kumar accused him of ignoring women’s welfare during his tenure. “Did the ones in power do anything for women? They could not have cared less. Only when, after seven years of chief ministership, a situation came where stepping down could not have been avoided, the wife was installed,” he said, referring to Rabri Devi’s appointment as chief minister in 1997.Kumar contrasted this with his own government’s focus on women’s empowerment, citing the success of self-help groups and the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, under which Rs 10,000 each has been transferred to over one crore women beneficiaries.Seeking a record fifth consecutive term, Nitish Kumar said he was disillusioned with the RJD after two short-lived alliances and has now decided to stay with the NDA for good.","Bihar chief minister nitish kumar reflected on his past alliances with the rashtriya janata dal.

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

CHANDIGARH: Justice Surya Kant, the most senior Supreme Court judge, is poised to assume the office of Chief Justice of India (CJI) next month. Few are aware of the extraordinary journey that brought him to the nation's highest judicial position.Unlike many who come from families with strong legal background, Justice Kant's journey began in Petwar - a nondescript village in Haryana's Hisar. He grew up far from privileges often associated with corridors of power. The first time he saw a city was when he travelled to Hansi, a small town in Hisar, for his Class X board exam.Until Class VIII, he studied in a village school that had no benches. As a student, he shared everyday responsibilities of rural life - working in fields during his spare time to support his family like any other rural boy. His father was a teacher.On formal confirmation, he will be the first Haryanvi to become CJI. He is expected to take over as 53rd Chief Justice of India on Nov 24, and slated to serve until Feb 9, 2027.Those who have worked closely with him describe Justice Kant as a jurist of deep learning and measured wisdom, admired for his balanced judgments and unwavering commitment to justice. Having served for over 14 years in Punjab and Haryana HC before his elevation as Himachal Pradesh HC Chief Justice and later as SC judge, he has consistently demonstrated a keen sensitivity toward matters concerning protection of public resources, land acquisition and compensation, victims' rights, reservation policies, and broader balance of constitutional principles.Sometime ago, while visiting his alma mater, Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak, Justice Kant spoke about his early life and modest beginnings. Electricity was a rarity in Petwar, he recalled and fondly remembered studying at night with friends, huddled under dim lamps, driven by hope of securing a govt job - a goal, he said, inspired him to persevere through every hardship.Born on Feb 10, 1962, Justice Kant completed his early education from Petwar and LLB in 1984 from MDU. He started as a lawyer at Hisar district court before moving to Chandigarh to practice at Punjab and Haryana HC.Justice Kant became the youngest advocate general of Haryana at 38. In 2004, aged 42, he was elevated as a judge of Punjab and Haryana HC. Even then, he continued his academic pursuits, securing first-class-first in his master's degree in law in 2011 from Kurukshetra University's directorate of distance education.After serving as HC judge for over 14 years, he was elevated as Himachal Pradesh HC CJ on Oct 5, 2018. On May 24, 2019, he became SC judge.In his 14-year stint as HC judge in Chandigarh, Justice Kant passed several landmark judgments, including right of jail inmates to have conjugal visits or artificial insemination for progeny.He also passed an order in a case where a husband had killed his wife. While punishing the guilty, he noticed the accused had four daughters. He personally spoke with a college principal, requesting free education for the eldest daughter.In Punjab and Haryana HC, he was part of the full bench that ordered sanitisation of Dera Sacha Sauda in 2017 following violence after imprisonment of the Dera chief in rape cases and directed a central probe into financial irregularities inside it. He served as a member of governing body of National Legal Services Authority from 2007 to 2011. In SC, he was part of benches that passed several landmark judgments.As CJ of Himachal Pradesh HC, he focused on administrative reforms and improving judicial efficiency. He reaffirmed access to basic amenities constituted an integral part of the fundamental right to life enshrined in the Constitution.",Justice surya kant will be the first haryanvi to become cji.

RS poll: NC denies ‘match fixing’ charge; Omar refuses to reveal names of MLAs who cross-voted for BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-poll-nc-denies-match-fixing-charge-omar-refuses-to-reveal-names-of-mlas-who-cross-voted-for-bjp/articleshow/124816552.cms,"Omar Abdullah

SRINAGAR: Political tempers are running high in Kashmir Valley after BJP won one of the four Rajya Sabha seats in J&K with support from four legislators outside the party on Friday. The National Conference (NC) leadership exonerated its legislators and allies of cross-voting charges, although party president Farooq Abdullah created a flutter by revealing that BJP had approached them before the polls.Chief minister Omar Abdullah said NC could not manage a clean sweep as it was betrayed, but he refused to disclose the names of those who cross-voted.“One shouldn’t have any complaints with a 3-1 score. We tried for a 4-nil victory, but we were ditched at the last moment by some people,” Omar said on Saturday.“Everyone knows the names of those who betrayed us and voted for BJP, I don’t want to repeat them. But, their act is regrettable,” Omar said, adding it was not appropriate to reveal the names.Giving a clean chit to his party members, the CM said, “I am satisfied that not a single NC vote went elsewhere. All NC legislators showed their polling slips to their party agent.”Omar thanked Congress and “some other colleagues” for their support, but did not name Membooba Mufti-led PDP, thus keep it in the circle of doubt. He also accused People’s Conference (PC) neta Sajad Lone of helping BJP by abstaining from voting, and “now lecturing us like a professor”.The retort came after Lone alleged that “all the cross-voting was done by NC”. “Omar Abdullah is the biggest supporter of BJP, bigger than their own leaders. The Rajya Sabha polls were a fixed match between BJP and NC. It was pre-decided that NC would take three seats and BJP one,” the PC chief told reporters.BJP on Friday sprang a surprise in J&K’s first RS elections since the abrogation of Article 370, winning a seat with 32 votes --- four more than its strength of 28 in the assembly.Farooq added more spice to the political debate, claiming that BJP had approached NC before the polls. Addressing a presser alongside the elected NC candidates, he said: “People will say whatever they have to say, but we didn’t gift any seat to BJP. They came to us ahead of the polls asking us for one seat. We refused and decided to fight it out.”Referring to Farooq’s statement, Lone said it was an admission that BJP and NC remained in touch. “That means a dialogue mechanism exists between the two parties. That means they had discussions about Rajya Sabha (polls)... Isn’t that what we have been saying all along --- fixed match,” he said.Jailed AAP legislator Mehraj Malik issued a statement saying he voted for NC in “the larger interests of J&K” despite no one from the party approaching him, but was “now being questioned by some of their leaders”. NC spokesperson Ifra Jasn had accused the Doda MLA of voting for BJP.",Bjp won one of the four rajya sabha seats in j&k with support from four legislators outside the party on friday.

Bihar polls: Sunset before sunrise for Jan Suraaj? 3 key challenges before the 'challenger',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-sunset-before-sunrise-for-jan-suraaj-3-key-challenges-before-the-challenger/articleshow/124804960.cms,"Jan Suraaj Party's Prashant Kishor Drops Bombshell, Reveals Why He Will Not Contest Bihar Elections

Challenges ahead of the challenger





Candidates’ desertion

Anger among party workers

Whose “B team” is Jan Suraaj anyway?

NEW DELHI: Bihar has long been a laboratory for political parties to test their ""prayogs"" to clinch power. The latest addition to such experiments is poll strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor 's Jan Suraaj, which has emerged as a third option for voters in the upcoming assembly elections and challenged the socialist forces — Janata Dal (United) and Rashtriya Janata Dal — by fielding candidates on all 243 seats.Prashant has been camping in Bihar for three years. He formed his party on October 2, 2024, vowing to contest the elections on the plank of development. However, as the elections inch closer, several challenges seem to surround PK and his party, making the climb to Ek Anne Marg even steeper.Jan Suraaj has been defeated on at least three seats as candidates walked out even before a single vote has been cast — Dr Shashi Shekhar Sinha from Gopalganj, Dr Satya Prakash Tiwari from Brahmpur (Buxar), and Akhilesh Kumar alias Mutor Sao from the Danapur seat in Patna.Additionally, Jan Suraaj leaders, including state spokesperson Amit Kumar Paswan, former district councillor Anita Kumari, and founding member Karmveer Paswan, have also recently joined the BJP ahead of the elections.However, Prashant Kishor accused the Bharatiya Janata Party and Union minister Amit Shah of “coercing and intimidating” his party’s candidates out of fear of losing the elections.“Look at this picture: you can see home minister Amit Shah and Dharmendra Pradhan.You talk about the model code of conduct... the home minister kept a candidate with him for one full day so that he could not file his nomination,” Kishor alleged.Meanwhile, party workers are also upset with Jan Suraaj's choice of candidates across the state. Workers have accused the party and Prashant Kishor of deceiving them by dropping “parachute candidates” after they had done all the groundwork for the elections.Speaking to The Times of India, Jan Suraaj leader Ravi Nandan Sahay said that probable candidates had deposited Rs 21,000 each to contest elections on the Jan Suraaj symbol from Kumhrar. However, the party chose former Patna University vice-chancellor KC Sinha from the constituency, who had not even formally joined the party.“The party workers are feeling cheated. The party had promised that tickets would only be given to a person among the probable candidates. However, I was shocked by the party’s decision to field KC Sinha from Kumhrar, who had not formally joined the party till then. Each probable candidate was also mandated to hold sabhas and distribute Parivaar Labhaarthi cards. All our efforts went in vain,” Sahay said.“Now, almost every probable candidate has left the party and decided to contest the poll independently. This will cause a significant dent in Jan Suraaj during the campaign,” he added.In the run-up to the assembly elections, both the Mahagathbandhan and NDA have accused Jan Suraaj of being the “B team” of each other. The perception has also seeped among voters who remain unsure about PK’s political allegiance.“Kishor realised that he would not win elections, and that is why he announced that he would not contest polls. Whatever he had invested in forming the Jan Suraaj Party has already been recovered. His party is nothing but a *vote katwa* (a party that cuts into others’ votes),” Union Minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh alleged after Prashant Kishor decided not to contest from Raghopur against RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.“Jan Suraaj is the ‘B team’ of the RJD,” Giriraj Singh added.Meanwhile, the RJD has maintained its accusation that Jan Suraaj is the “B team” of the Nitish Kumar-led ruling alliance in Bihar.Now, it remains to be seen how Prashant Kishor persuades voters that his party is a viable alternative and not merely a vote katwa or spoiler in the upcoming elections.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar Assembly elections. The 243 assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases — on November 6 and November 11 — with the counting of votes scheduled for November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, compared to 7.89 crore in the first draft list released before the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) on June 24 this year. According to an Election Commission release, around 65 lakh voters were removed during the revision process, bringing the number of electors in the updated draft list, as of August 1, 2025, to 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly elections, the BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share. Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with a 15.7% vote share. Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) contested seven seats, winning four, and secured 0.9% of the vote share.","Prashant kishor has been camping in bihar for three years.

NEW DELHI: Back in 2020, when the police and paramilitary forces heavily depended on foreign dog breeds like German Shepherd, Labrador Retriever and Belgian Malinois etc for their dog squads, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had sought to challenge status quo, suggesting the equally agile and more resilient ‘desi’ dog breeds as an ‘atmanirbhar’ alternative.Five years later, the PM will witness the success of his proposed experiment, in person. A contingent made up exclusively of Indian breed dogs like ‘Mudhol Hound’ and ‘Rampur Hound’ — trained by the BSF and now serving as force-multipliers on the eastern and border border, in anti-Naxal operations and narcotics detection — will proudly march in his presence during the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas parade on October 31, at Ekta Nagar in Narmada district of Gujarat.Ekta Nagar is home to Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s towering statue, the tallest in the world at 182 metres.This year being the 150th birth centenary of Sardar Patel, the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas celebrations will include a grand parade by the Central armed police forces (CAPFs), including their dog squads, cavalry and camel contingents, and the state police forces. Prime Minister Modi, the guest of honour, will receive the ceremonial salute from the five CRPF Shaurya Chakra awardees as well as the 16 BSF personnel recently honoured with gallantry medals for their valour in Operation Sindoor.Also thrown in are a cultural show featuring grand performances by NCC cadets and school bands; an air show; motorcycle stunts; and tableaux of different states celebrating ‘Unity in Diversity’, BSF DG Daljit Singh Chawdhary shared at a press conference here on Friday.The Guard of Honor to be presented to the PM will be led by a female officer. Women personnel of CISF and CRPF will demonstrate their martial arts and unarmed combat skills.The ‘desi’ breed dogs contingent will be led by female BSF Mudhol Hound ‘Riya’ — conferred the ‘Best Dog’ title at the 2024 All Indian Police Duty meet in Lucknow, after beating 116 foreign breed competitors. Indigenous breeds Rampur Hound and Mudhol Hound will also demonstrate their versatile skills like climbing 18 ft wall and intercepting terrorists or intruders.BSF commandant (veterinary medicine) Sandeep Gupta shared that the force had taken a cue from PM’s ‘Mann ki Baat’ programme and started researching ‘desi’ breeds; they were found better adapted to Indian weather, besides being resilient and agile. “We limited ourselves to studying the parent generation of breeds like Mudhol Hound and Rampur Hound. A breeding programme was started and the second generation was introduced to human socialisation and foundational training. ..it was only with the third generation that we started methodical training,” he said.Chawdhary on Friday said the force has trained 150 Indian breed dogs so far and deployed them “from Thar to Tawang”.","Border security force's nearly 40 india-bred dogs- rampur hounds and mudhol hounds- will participate in the national unity day parade on october 31.
