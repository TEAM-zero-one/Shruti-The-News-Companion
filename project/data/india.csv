MUMBAI: The CJI’s first visit since he took oath was not without bureaucratic and protocol hiccups. He pointed out during his speech that neither the chief secretary nor the DGP or Mumbai police commissioner had turned up when “the Chief Justice of India , who is from Maharashtra, has arrived for the first time…”“…we say there are three pillars of democracy, and they are equal, and every organ of the institution must reciprocate and give respect to other organs.

I’m not insisting on protocol, but it’s a respect by other organs of the institution to the judiciary. When a chief of an organ of the Constitution is coming for the first time to the state, and when he too belongs to the said state, whether the treatment they gave was right or not, they themselves should think.

IMPHAL/NEW DELHI: Security forces in Manipur have arrested more than 350 insurgents during intensified crackdown on extortion rackets that have taken an unusual turn, with groups mainly from the Valley now demanding money to resolve matrimonial disputes, along with traditional targets like property and “cuts” in govt tenders, officials said on Sunday. The insurgents were picked from mid-Feb this year after the imposition of President’s rule in the state.A clear instruction has been issued by the governor’s administration to the general public to report any extortion attempts to police or face legal consequences for aiding the insurgents.The officials said investigations against the more than 350 people arrested in the crackdown indicate that insurgent groups, feeling the pressure from security forces post-President’s rule, are becoming more desperate for funds and more brazen in their methods.The majority of insurgents have been nabbed from Imphal East, followed by Imphal West in the valley. It's just about money, and for that, they settle personal scores, family feuds and even matrimonial disputes. If you have a problem, and you have the right connections, they become your ‘solution’ but for a price, of course, the officials said.Recently, a person codenamed ‘Tiger’ was picked up from Imphal East by Manipur police while he was busy settling a matrimonial dispute with family members of a bride and groom, the officials said. Later, he was identified as Laishram Ramesh Singh, belonging to the banned United National Liberation Front (UNLF). During preliminary verification, he told the police that he joined the organisation in Sept 2024 and is presently working in its “finance section”.The officials said he confessed to being involved in extortion activities by serving monetary demands and threats and by collecting money from government officials located in and around the Imphal area, besides collecting “cuts” from business houses who had been allotted various government tenders.Two mobile handsets and Rs 21,50,000 of extortion money were recovered from him.The officials said the insurgent groups were exploiting technology and one of the tactics involved obtaining SIM cards with false documentation from any northeastern state and using them to make Voice over Internet Protocol calls routed through Wi-Fi networks.","Security forces in manipur have arrested more than 350 insurgents during intensified crackdown on extortion rackets.

BENGALURU: A resident at Prestige Sunrise Park in Electronics City phase 1 in Bengaluru has been paying daily penalties of Rs 100 for maintaining his shoe rack outside his flat.The residential complex, comprising 1046 units, launched an initiative to remove all personal items, including shoe storage units, plants in pots and storage cabinets from common areas. Nearly 50% of residents were found to have placed their belongings outside, violating established guidelines.The Residents' Association distributed notices and engaged in thorough communication with occupants, requesting removal of items. They provided a reasonable timeline of two months for compliance. Despite initial opposition, the majority of residents complied with the directive.Approximately four weeks later, all but two residents had cleared their belongings from the corridors. One resident eventually complied after continuous reminders. The second resident remained adamant about keeping the shoe rack outside.This resident even made an advance payment of rupees 15,000, requesting it be applied towards future penalties and asked to be left undisturbed.Despite escalating fines, the resident continued paying while refusing to remove the shoe rack.""He has paid a fine of Rs 24,000 over the last eight months,"" Arun Prasad, president of the association told TOI, adding the association is planning to raise the daily penalty from Rs 100 to Rs 200 to address this specific situation.Fire safety regulations stipulate that corridors in high-rise buildings must remain clear of obstacles to facilitate safe evacuation during emergencies.","A resident at prestige sunrise park in electronics city in bengaluru has been paying daily penalties of rs 100 for maintaining his shoe rack outside his flat.

Short circuit turned get-together into tragedy

None of 17 Hyd fire victims taken to hospitals could be revived

HYDERABAD: A century-old three-storey Hyderabad building close to the iconic Charminar caught fire early Sunday, killing 17 members across three generations of a jeweller’s family that had assembled in their ancestral home for what was to be a weekend get-together.Patriarch Prahlad Modi , whose roots in Gulzar Houz go back to the Nizam era, and eight children were among the victims, ranging from 2 to 73 years old. They died either from burn injuries or asphyxiation, officials said.Four family members, two of whom were not at home, and some of their workers survived the 6am blaze, suspected to have been caused by an electrical short circuit. Fire engines needed more than two hours to douse the flames, by which time much of the residential-cum-commercial building had been gutted.Fire brigade officials identified the main electrical panel on the ground floor that houses three jewellery stores of the family as the source of the fire. One of the stores had been in business since 1906.“Sparks caused by the short circuit in the main electrical line spread through the wooden panel and triggered a blast in the compressor unit of one of the ACs, resulting in the blaze growing,” director general of fire services Y Nagi Reddy said. “Since the building has only one entrance and exit, and the staircase is very narrow, residents couldn’t escape. The smoke further made it difficult for them to navigate their way out.”Nagi Reddy said 11 fire engines, a firefighting robot, 17 officers and 70 personnel were deployed to rescue survivors and douse the flames. He contested allegations by relatives of the dead about a delayed response. “We received a call at 6.16am and immediately rushed our teams to the fire scene,” the DG said.Charminar police station registered a fire accident case based on a complaint by a relative of Prahlad Modi.None of the 17 victims who had been taken to different hospitals – Osmania General Hospital, Apollo Hospital and Yashoda Hospital – could be revived. They were all cremated in the evening.Residents of the Gulzar Houz neighbourhood recalled hearing ominous noises from the building where Prahlad Modi lived with his wife Munni and others soon after the fire broke out. “By the time we reached the site, the entire building was engulfed in flames. There was little hope of anyone surviving,” said Mir Zahid, a neighbour.PM Narendra Modi announced ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh to the next of kin of each of the deceased from the PM’s National Relief Fund. “Deeply anguished by the loss of lives due to a fire tragedy in Hyderabad, Telangana. Condolences to those who have lost their loved ones. May the injured recover soon,” he wrote on X.Telangana CM A Revanth Reddy, too, announced Rs 5 lakh in ex gratia to the victims’ immediate families.Prahlad Modi and his family migrated to Hyderabad from Rajasthan decades ago and have been based in Gulzar Houz since. The extended clan, now spread across the city, would often meet at the patriarch’s home, sources said.","Patriarch prahlad modi and eight children were among the victims, ranging from 2 to 73 years old.

Right to shelter

is fundamental right: CJI on bulldozer justice

MUMBAI: Amidst the debate over the timelines set by the SC for governors and the President, Chief Justice of India Bhushan Gavai on Sunday said neither the judiciary nor the executive or the legislature had an upper hand, but rather it is the Constitution of India that is “supreme” and “all the three wings have to work together as per the Constitution.The statement comes barely days after President Droupadi Murmu sent a 14-point Presidential Reference to SC asking if the court can “impose” timelines and prescribe the conduct of governors and the President when handling state bills sent for assent or reserved for consideration. Centre had accused SC of stepping into executive domain.Justice Gavai, who took oath as the 52nd CJI last week, was speaking at a felicitation function organised by the Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa . Justice Gavai said, “The basic structure is strong, and all three pillars of the Constitution are equal. And all the organs of the Constitution must reciprocate and give due respect to each other,” he said.Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, but it cannot touch the “basic structure”, he said. The ‘basic structure’ doctrine holds that certain fundamental features of the Constitution, such as its supremacy, the rule of law, and independence of the judiciary, cannot be amended or abrogated by Parliament through a constitutional amendment.The recent Presidential Reference invoked SC’s advisory jurisdiction under Article 143 (1) of the Constitution to determine if timelines can be set.The President’s move stemmed from a May 8 judgment by an SC bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan on a petition by the Tamil Nadu govt challenging the governor’s delay in clearing bills passed a second time by the legislature and his move to reserve them for the President’s consideration.The reference pointed out that “there are conflicting judgments of the Supreme Court as to whether the assent of the President of India under Article 201 of the Constitution of India is justiciable or not”.In April, while hearing two matters before his elevation as CJI, Justice Gavai had observed, “As it is, we are alleged of encroaching upon the parliamentary and executive functions .” The executive had questioned apparent judicial overreach while hearing a matter over violence in West Bengal. In another matter regarding explicit online content, Justice Gavai had orally observed that it was for the Union to frame rules in that regard. “As it is, we are now criticised that we are interfering with the executive’s function, the legislative functions ,” he had said.Gavai on Sunday said he was glad that the country has not only strengthened, but developed on the social and economic justice fronts. Referring to his judgment against ‘bulldozer justice’, he said the right to shelter is supreme.“The right to shelter is a fundamental right. Whether a person is accused of any crime or convicted, the family’s house, if legally occupied, cannot be removed or demolished. The rule of law has to be followed.”Regarding his visits to various areas across the country, including Maharashtra, he said, “We also recently visited Manipur and assured both warring communities that the country is with you and justice is at your doorstep, so avail it.”The event also saw the release of a book chronicling 50 remarkable judgments pronounced by Justice Gavai.",Cji gavai was speaking at a felicitation function organised by the bar council of maharashtra and goa.

Poll Do you believe that social media influencers can be unwittingly involved in national security issues? No, they are responsible for their actions. Yes, they can be manipulated.

NEW DELHI: The Haryana Police claim YouTuber Jyoti Malhotra , arrested last week on charges of sharing sensitive information and maintaining regular contact with a Pakistani national, wasn’t working alone. She was allegedly in touch with other social media influencers , some of whom may also have links to Pakistani intelligence operatives .“They were developing her as an asset,” said Hisar SP Shashank Kumar Sawan. “She was in touch with other YouTube influencers, and they were also in touch with the PIOs. She used to go to Pakistan, like on sponsored trips... We are investigating, as we have leads that other people were also involved with her.”Malhotra, who runs the YouTube channel Travel with JO with 3.77 lakh subscribers and has 1.33 lakh Instagram followers, is now on five-day police remand. Authorities say her frequent international travels, including multiple visits to Pakistan and one to China, do not match her reported income.“During the conflict (Indo-Pak), she was in touch with the PIOs... Her travel details are defying her total income,” said SP Sawan. “We received inputs from central agencies, and we arrested Jyoti Malhotra.”The investigation has also reached Odisha, where a YouTuber from Puri has come under scrutiny. Malhotra had visited the coastal town in September 2024. “We are examining the objective of her visit, where she stayed, whom she contacted, and any possible suspicious activities,” said Puri SP Vinit Agrawal.The Puri YouTuber’s father confirmed that the two were friends. “My daughter came in contact with Jyoti Malhotra as both are YouTubers... As it is a matter of the nation's security, a proper investigation should be carried out. We will cooperate with the police,” he said.In an Instagram post, the woman from Puri said, “Jyoti was just a friend of mine, and I came in contact with her through YouTube. I was unaware of anything which she is accused of. I would not have been in touch with her if I knew she was spying for enemy Pakistan.”“If any investigative agency wishes to cross-question, I would provide full cooperation. Nation is above all. Jai Hind,” she added.Police are now analysing Malhotra’s financials and digital trails to identify others who may be involved.","Jyoti malhotra, who runs the youtube channel travel with jo with 3.77 lakh subscribers and has 1.33 lakh instagram followers, is now on five-day police remand.

CRPF DG: Operation Blackforest marks ‘beginning of end of Naxalism’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/crpf-dg-operation-blackforest-marks-beginning-of-end-of-naxalism/articleshow/121254833.cms,"File photo

BIJAPUR: As CRPF DG G P Singh puts it succinctly, the 21-day “largest-ever” anti-Naxal operation in the Karregattalu Hills on the Chhattisgarh-Telangana border was “the beginning of the end of Left-Wing extremism”.Ahead of the March 31, 2026 deadline set by home minister Amit Shah to eliminate Naxalism from the country, security forces have their task cut out — keep up the pressure on Maoists by continuing to overwhelm them with sustained operations across the regions where they still operate, albeit in segregated groups with an eroded arsenal; corner them so that they are left with just two options: surrender or get neutralised; and block all avenues for the Maoists to regroup and re-enter areas now free from their hold, while also offering the locals benefits of govt’s flagship schemes in the secure bubble created by CRPF’s forward operating bases there.Operation Blackforest — which showcased exemplary coordination among central and state security forces, culminating in the elimination of 31 Maoists and segregating their strongest formations into disjointed, dislocated units — shall serve as a template for more intel-based actions in the days and months to come, as per sources. The follow-up operations will possibly be on a smaller scale, since the Maoists are now hiding in smaller groups, scattered across pockets of Indravati national park area, west Bastar, south Bastar, Telangana and a small portion of few other states.“Anti-Naxal operations are currently under way in Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar and Maharashtra as part of a multi-front offensive to wipe out the vestiges of Maoist setups there. Already, 5-6 appeals have been made by CPI(Maoist) requesting a ceasefire and dialogue, indicating their desperation,” a senior Chhattisgarh Police official told TOI.A senior central govt functionary, however, said stopping operations may not be an option while the top CPI(Maoist) leadership is still in hiding. “Let them come out and surrender their arms. We cannot talk to a ‘faceless’ group,” said the officer.Surrenders have already peaked this year, with 718 Maoists having joined the mainstream in the first four months as against 928 throughout 2024. “As the pressure grows with more anti-Naxal operations, more surrenders will follow; there is already growing disenchantment within as the top Maoist leadership remains silent and safely ensconced even as the senior Maoists and cadres are getting killed,” said the functionary.Sources said that though only 31 bodies of Maoists killed in Operation Blackforest were recovered, the forces’ own estimate points to 40-45 fatalities. “At least two dead whose bodies could not be retrieved, were very senior Maoist cadres,” said a senior CRPF officer involved in the operation.The officer told TOI that intel-based, anti-Maoist operations will continue even during the monsoon, as the forces are now placed on either side of the Indravati river. “Earlier, a swollen Indravati river and rainwater channels during monsoon would cut off access to the interior Maoist dens; now, the forces can embark on operations from the nearest FOB,” he said.With good technical intelligence, the Maoist hideouts are no longer ‘dark spots’. The forces are confident that the smaller and scattered groups of Maoists/PLGA will be located and neutralised. “The morale of the forces is high and Operation Blackforest has conditioned us physically and mentally to corner Maoists in their core area,” said a second CRPF officer.“It is possible that Left-Wing extremism will be eliminated a few months earlier than the March 2026 deadline,” the officer said but warned that the Maoists may resort to desperate attacks like killing civilians on the pretext of being “informers” and targeting security forces with IEDs improvised to inflict maximum casualty.","The 21-day anti-naxal operation in the karregattalu hills on the chhattisgarh-telangana border was “the beginning of the end of left-wing extremism’ the follow-up operations will possibly be on a smaller scale, since the maoists are now hiding in smaller groups, scattered across pockets of indravati national park area.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121254829,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-71018,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

The ugly Sarma vs Gogoi fight



NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday launched a sharp attack on Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi , alleging that he had visited Pakistan on ""ISI's invitation"" and worked closely with the establishment. Responding to the allegation, Gogoi hit back, calling the chief minister a ""troll.""Speaking to reporters, Sarma claimed, ""Gaurav Gogoi visited Pakistan on an invitation of the ISI. For the first time, I am saying this. We have documents of the same. He did not go for tourism purposes. He went there definitely for taking training.""Sarma added that Gogoi, who is the deputy leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, travelled on a direct invitation from the Pakistan government, calling the visit ""dangerous.""""He was (working) closely with the Pakistan establishment. When does the Home Department send an invitation? It is only to impart training,"" Sarma asserted.""An invitation from the foreign affairs (department) or any university is altogether a different thing. This was not from the foreign affairs or cultural departments. He went there on a direct invitation from the home department of Pakistan,"" he added.The CM further claimed that the government has solid proof of Gogoi’s visit and said that there’s no way he can deny or escape from it.""All his paths are closed. We have seen the evidence. Only we need time till September to get the papers. We have to submit a notice and then the embassy will provide us with the documents. September 10 is final and please do not ask about this again till that time,"" Sarma noted.Responding to the Assam CM's remarks, Gaurav Gogoi called them ""absurd"". In a series of posts on X, Gogoi reflected on the chief minister's mental state and said he has been targeted with baseless claims for years.In one post he said, ""I am worried about the health of the chief minister of Assam. For some reason best known to him I have been on his radar since my entry into Assam. He has made many baseless remarks about me in the past 13 years. The most recent one borders on insanity and the absurd. It is often said that when there is something bothering at home, it reflects in the mental state of the person. We will ensure that after 2026 he gets to have some rest.""In a separate post he wrote, ""The script that the chief minister is following is worse than a B grade film. It is said to cover up one lie a person has to say countless lies. That is exactly what the chief minister is doing.""""He is not giving out any facts and simply behaving like a IT cell troll. A Chief Minister should not be a troll. If he has any facts supporting his most recent allegation he should put out in public domain. The farce cannot be hidden for too long,"" he added.Earlier, Sarma had posted a series of pointed questions on X regarding the MP’s alleged visit to Pakistan and his family's ties to a Pakistan-based NGO. Without naming Gogoi directly, Sarma had asked whether the Congress leader had visited Pakistan for 15 consecutive days and demanded clarification on the purpose of the trip.“Questions for the Hon’ble Member of Parliament from the Congress Party : 1. Did you visit Pakistan for a continuous period of 15 days? If so, could you kindly clarify the purpose of your visit?” Sarma had said in his post. ""If so, may we ask why a Pakistan-based organisation is paying a salary for activities conducted in India?"" Sarma had questioned.Responding to the CM, Gogoi had hit back, asking if Sarma would resign in case he fails to prove his allegations. ""Questions for the Hon’ble Chief Minister of Assam: 1) Will you resign if you fail to prove your allegations of me and my wife being agents of an enemy country? 2) Will you take questions on your own children and wife? 3) Will the state police arrest those linked to coal mafia who make are ravaging the hills of Assam and making crores of undeclared money? Waiting for the SIT report to be submitted,"" Gogoi wrote on X.The exchange of words didn't stop at Gogoi's questions as Sarma responded to the Congress leader, saying ""sufficient material will be placed in the public domain exposing the connections between the concerned Congress Member of Parliament and Pakistan"".""I would like to clarify that neither I nor my son and daughter have ever visited Pakistan. Furthermore, my wife and our entire family would never even think of accepting any salary or financial support from Pakistan. All members of my family, including my wife, son, and daughter, are Indian citizens. None of my children has ever surrendered or renounced Indian citizenship. Now, it is your turn to answer. In the coming days, sufficient material will be placed in the public domain exposing the connections between the concerned Congress Member of Parliament and Pakistan. Wait for 10th September 2025,"" the Assam CM wrote in a reply to Gogoi.Gogoi again repeated his questions in response to the Assam CM's assertions. ""None of the questions answered. I will repeat. 1) Will you resign if you fail to prove your allegations of me and my wife being agents of an enemy country? 2) Will you take questions on your own children and wife? 3) Will the state police arrest those linked to coal mafia who make are ravaging the hills of Assam and making crores of undeclared money? Wait for 2026,"" the Congress MP wrote.Sarma further alleged that the MP’s wife ""continues to receive a salary from a Pakistan-based NGO while residing and working in India."" In another claim, Sarma said that only Gogoi in his family holds Indian citizenship, while his two children have surrendered theirs.""The father of the children who is an MP surrendered their citizenship. It is not the children, who are innocent, but their father who surrendered it. I wonder how the children will react when they grow up and realise that they are not a citizen of a country where their grandfather was the chief minister of a state for 15 years,"" Sarma said. ""This is both morally and legally wrong,"" he added.","Assam chief minister himanta biswa sarma alleges congress mp gaurav gogoi visited pakistan on ""isi's invitation"" sarma calls the visit ""dangerous"" and says he was working closely with the pakistan establishment.

VARANASI: A cattle smuggler was killed while two others were injured in an encounter while they were trying to escape after crushing a police constable to death in UP’s Jaunpur late Saturday night.Within hours of this incident, another encounter between cattle smugglers and police took place in neighbouring district of Varanasi, leading to the arrest of four men. Two of the accused sustained bullet injuries on their legs, police said.Jaunpur SP Kaustubh said the encounter in the district took place while police checked vehicles on Azamgarh-Varanasi road following intelligence inputs and tried to stop a pick-up van. “The van broke barricades and fled towards Varanasi, hitting many passers-by in the process.

Stalin urges 8 non-BJP CMs to unite against Centre on governor power,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stalin-urges-8-non-bjp-cms-to-unite-against-centre-on-governor-power/articleshow/121255067.cms,"Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin (File photo)

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin has written to his counterparts in seven non-BJP governed states and a UT, urging a united legal fight against the Presidential reference to the Supreme Court on the power of governors.The letter was sent on May 17 to CMs of West Bengal, Kerala, Karnataka, Telangana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Punjab and J&K to oppose the reference sought by the President in the apex court. “We must evolve a coordinated legal strategy before the court and present a united front to preserve and protect the basic structure of the Constitution,” he wrote.The letter was in response to President Droupadi Murmu invoking Article 143 of the Constitution to seek SC’s opinion on 14 legal questions. While the reference does not name any specific case, Stalin said the move was an attempt to dilute the SC’s ruling in State of Tamil Nadu vs governor of TN case. “This historic judgment, obtained by my govt, is not just a victory for Tamil Nadu but for all states,” Stalin wrote. “It prevents the obstruction of democratically enacted state legislations by governors who are unelected appointees of the Union govt,” he said. The judgment had laid down a timeline for governors to grant assent to state Bills.Stalin said the Centre ’s attempt to revisit this ruling via the court’s advisory jurisdiction is an “effort to unsettle the judgment” and warned that the move could erode the federal structure enshrined in the Constitution. He said it was the BJP govt which advised the President to seek a reference before the SC, which “pointed to the sinister intent” of BJP.“BJP is attempting to unsettle this judgment, which can be invoked as a precedent by other states when faced with an obstinate governor,” Stalin wrote, adding he was hopeful of an immediate and personal intervention of the eight CMs on the issue.","Tamil nadu cm mk stalin has written to his counterparts in seven non-bjp governed states and a ut.

KOLHAPUR: Eight people died early Sunday when a fire swept through a textile factory in Maharashtra’s Solapur district. Among the dead were 1.5-year-old child Yusuf Mansuri and his 87-year-old grandfather Usman Mansuri , owner and founder of the factory that produced bath and hand towels.The blaze broke out between 3.30am and 4am at Central Textile Company in Akkalkot Road MIDC , likely triggered by an electrical short circuit. Victims included four members of the factory owner’s family and four from a worker’s family who lived at the site.Rescue efforts were hampered by a religious structure erected near the main entrance by the owner’s family. Firefighters accessed the building using ladders and breached a 20-foot back wall to enter. Three people were pulled out alive, but thick smoke and flames stalled further rescues. Three firefighters, including the chief fire officer, suffered burns on their palms and faces. They continued efforts through the morning and afternoon. Around 8am, bodies of Mehtab Bagwan (51), Hina Bagwan (35), and Salman Bagwan (18) were found. By 3pm, remains of Usman, Anas Mansuri (24), Shika Mansuri (24), Yusuf, and Ayesha Bagwan (45) were also found. While the Mansuris were related to the owner, the Bagwans were from the worker’s family. A distant relative identified the Mansuri family’s remains. No immediate family members survived.SDO Sadashiv Paddune said the factory spanned roughly 10,000 to 12,000 sqft. Residents reported hearing a loud sound before flames erupted. The fire raged for six to seven hours, with recovery efforts lasting over 12 hours. Property losses, including machinery and raw material, are estimated at Rs 1 crore.","The blaze broke out between 3.30am and 4am at central textile company in akkalkot road midc.

HYDERABAD: The sight of an elderly woman’s charred body tightly hugging four children – all of them dead – will haunt first responders Mir Zahid and Mohd Azmat for a long time.“When we managed to get inside the building and reached the first floor, we saw this woman with her arms around the kids – two girls, a boy and an infant. She must have tried to shield them from the advancing flames,” said Zahid, a resident of the Gulzar Houz neighbourhood where 17 members of a jeweller’s family died in a blaze early Sunday.The woman was clasping a mobile phone with the torch on, suggesting she was unable to see anything because of the smoke. “They had little chance of escaping,” Zahid said.Fellow volunteer Azmat said that was the moment he knew there would be no survivors. “We put a bedsheet on them. It was an unbearable scene. I don’t think I will ever be able to put into words what I saw in that house,” he said.The men found two more bodies in the same room.Zahid and his friends had entered the building by demolishing the wall of an adjacent structure.","17 members of a jeweller’s family died in a blaze early sunday.

At least 50 people had a miraculous escape in a similar fire some 8km away at a residential building in Hyderabad’s Mailardevpally.Those rescued include children as young as 15 months to 2 years. The fire broke out at 7.18am in a building which houses 10-15 families, at Mughal Colony in Udamgadda. The blaze began due to an electrical short-circuit on the ground floor, which contained motor pumps, defunct bicycles, and various waste material, contributing to the flames. Officials said had the fire occurred a few hours earlier when residents were asleep, it could have mirrored the Gulzar Houz tragedy.“Most occupants had just woken up and were preparing to start the day. The blaze erupted within moments. As dense smoke began making its way upwards, residents rushed to the terrace. Fire service personnel rescued them,” said a fire officer. The fire was contained within 90 minutes.Meanwhile, chief minister A Revanth Reddy on Sunday announced a comprehensive inquiry into the Gulzar Houz fire accident, based on which an action plan will be evolved to prevent such incidents in the future.","The fire broke out at 7.18am in a building which houses 10-15 families, at mughal colony in udamgadda.

BHUBANESWAR: A 21-year-old YouTuber from Puri is being investigated on suspicion of collaborating with Haryana travel blogger Jyoti Malhotra, who was arrested Saturday for allegedly spying for Pakistan. The unnamed woman came under the scanner after it emerged that she had travelled to Kartarpur Corridor, a visa-free border crossing leading to Gurdwara Sri Darbar Sahib , shortly after Jyoti’s visit to Jagannath Temple in Puri on Sept 21 last year.“Haryana Police and other security agencies are in touch with us. We have questioned the YouTuber and shared details with them,” Puri SP Vinit Agrawal said.The content creator’s parents said they were confident she was innocent, but would cooperate with security agencies as “India comes first and our daughter second”. Police sources said Jyoti, who stayed for three days in Puri, met her fellow YouTuber during the trip. The Puri woman said her friendship with Jyoti started online around eight months ago after the duo bonded over their shared love of travel vlogging.“Had I known her alleged anti-national activities , I would not have struck a friendship with her. I am ready to face questioning by any agency,” she was quoted as telling interrogators. SP Agrawal said investigators hadn’t found any incriminating detail about Jyoti’s Odisha visit and her interactions with the Puri vlogger.The woman’s father said his daughter and Jyoti were “merely” friends. “My daughter has no involvement in anti-national activities and was unaware of Jyoti’s alleged espionage. Since she loves travelling, she made a pilgrimage to Kartarpur with another friend (not Jyoti) three months ago. She received official permission to visit the place,” he said.","A 21-year-old youtuber from puri is being investigated on suspicion of collaborating with haryana travel blogger jyoti malhotra.

DEHRADUN: Five Bangladeshi nationals, including a woman, were arrested in Dehradun’s Clement Town Saturday night for allegedly staying illegally in India without proper travel documents, police said on Sunday.

RAIPUR: Chhattisgarh high court (HC), citing a woman’s adulterous conduct, ruled against her plea for maintenance from her estranged husband.Justice Arvind Kumar Verma gave the ruling while hearing two criminal revision petitions challenging a Raipur family court order to the husband to pay Rs 4,000 monthly maintenance to his wife. Both the parties had challenged the decision — the husband sought complete annulment while the wife demanded it to be increased to Rs 20,000.The husband’s counsel argued the wife was not eligible for maintenance as she was in an adulterous relationship with his younger brother. This was established through a divorce decree granted by the family court on Sept 8, 2023, the counsel said.Family court overlooked this crucial evidence & disregarded CrPC section 125(4), which explicitly disallows maintenance for a wife living in adultery or leaving her marital home without a valid reason, the counsel said.The wife’s counsel refuted the adultery claim, arguing that any past extramarital affair was not a ‘continuous act’. The counsel stressed that “living in adultery” necessitates an ongoing illicit relationship, which they claimed was not the case as the wife was then living with her brother and sister-in-law. They argued that Rs 4,000 in maintenance was not enough, considering the wife’s lack of independent income and the husband’s alleged multiple revenue sources.HC observed that the divorce decree, granted on the grounds of the wife’s adultery, constituted legal proof of her disqualification under section 125(4) CrPC.HC allowed the husband’s revision petition and set aside the family court’s maintenance order. The wife’s petition seeking enhancement of maintenance was dismissed.","Justice arvind kumar verma gave the ruling while hearing two criminal revision petitions challenging a raipur family court order to the husband to pay rs 4,000 monthly maintenance to his wife.

Policy soon for easy liquidation of cooperatives: Amit Shah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/policy-soon-for-easy-liquidation-of-cooperatives-amit-shah/articleshow/121254839.cms,"Union home minister Amit Shah

GANDHINAGAR: Union home and cooperation minister Amit Shah announced Sunday that Centre will introduce soon a new policy for speedy liquidation of defunct primary agricultural credit societies ( PACS ) and registration of new ones.He outlined a target to establish two lakh new PACS by 2029, with 22 designated business activities aimed at ensuring financial stability and long-term viability. “The work of connecting 22 different types of businesses with PACS was done by Union govt and I am sure arrangements have been made to ensure not a single registered PACS becomes financially sick,” he added. He was speaking at a “Sahakari Sammelan” held at Science City in Ahmedabad to mark International Year of Cooperatives . Over 4,000 delegates representing 800 cooperative institutions attended the event.PACS provide short-term and medium-term loans to farmers for agricultural activities, operating at village level. They promote financial inclusion, offer affordable credit, and support rural economic development by reducing dependence on informal moneylenders.Among the business avenues encouraged for PACS are cooperative-owned manufacturing units for products such as ice cream, paneer, and other cheese. Shah highlighted a plan to promote a circular economy in the dairy sector by forming cooperatives to process skin, bones, and horns of deceased livestock.The Union minister said India’s cooperative movement , born during the freedom struggle, had faltered in several regions but remained strong in Gujarat. “It is the responsibility of cooperative leaders in Gujarat to make the growth of the movement symmetric,” he said.Shah also reviewed progress of “cooperation among cooperatives” pilot project, initially launched in Banaskantha and Panchmahal districts and now expanded statewide. He reported that 60% of the project has been completed and that deposits in cooperative banks have risen by Rs 11,000 crore.“All members of cooperatives, dairies, agriculture produce marketing committees (APMCs), and PACS should have accounts in cooperative banks,” he said.","Amit shah outlined a target to establish two lakh new pacs by 2029.

"For those falsely accused of conversion, fear doesn’t end with an acquittal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-those-falsely-accused-of-conversion-fear-doesnt-end-with-an-acquittal/articleshow/121254835.cms,"FAITH OR FORCE? A protest against the anti-conversion law. Eleven states have such laws, but there has been little by way of assessing their impact

Religious conversions have always been a fraught issue in India. Even as the Supreme Court is set to hear pleas challenging anti-conversion laws , the process has already become punishment for some. Not only have they been forced to spend time and resources defending themselves in conversion cases but continue to live in fear even after being acquitted.Two years ago, one sweltering Sunday morning in June, 35-year-old Sonu Saroj’s life turned upside down. The bike mechanic, who lives in Kodra village in UP’s Rae Bareilly, was conducting a Christian prayer meeting in a makeshift shed with several relatives and neighbours when about 35-40 people armed with sticks and claiming to be from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad attacked the group. “They just kept hitting us,” Saroj recalls. Some of them also ransacked his house. His wife sustained head injuries and fainted while his bleeding nephew and he were dragged to the police station.“We kept pleading with the police that we were the victims not the culprits, but no one listened to us,” he says. He was later booked under the UP anti-conversion law or the Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act, 2021 (an amended, more stringent version of the 2020 ordinance). It took multiple visits and witness accounts following which Saroj was cleared of all charges by a local court in Sept 2024. Though free at least, Saroj is too scared to hold prayer gatherings.Eleven states, including Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, UP and Karnataka, have anti-conversion laws and several other states are planning to have them. In both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, where such laws already exist, the administration has announced more stringent versions with MP even planning to introduce death penalty as punishment. Yet, there has been little by way of assessing the impact of these legislations.An estimated 835 cases were registered in UP with 1,682 arrested between Nov 2020 and July 2024 under the anti-conversion law. Just days after the anti-conversion law was passed in UP in Nov 2020, the first person to be booked was Muzaffarnagar resident Nadeem, accused of “trapping” a married woman and converting her. A case of ‘love jihad’ was filed by her husband who had employed Nadeem for work.It later emerged that her husband was riled up by the fact that his wife sought shelter at Nadeem’s house after a fight between the couple. “It was a domestic dispute that was turned into a fake conversion case against me,” Nadeem says. “I had no support, and no one believed me. I was humiliated, called names. It took me over a year to get out of that mess,” Nadeem says. He was acquitted by the Allahabad high court in Jan 2021. “Aaj bhi jail ke baare mein soch ke rooh kamp jaati hai (Just the thought of prison sends shivers down my spine even today),” says the 29-year-old.In Chhattisgarh’s Mokhpal village, it took over a dozen Christian residents, who were beaten and their belongings destroyed, seven years to overthrow conversion allegations. Dantewada resident Sangeeta Kartami and her husband were part of a group who would gather to pray every Sunday at Mokhpal, 32 km from her home. On Oct 15, 2017, Kartami remembers the group had finished their prayers and most people had already left when a large mob attacked them with sticks. “I was hit on the head with a lathi and suddenly felt blood pouring out. I don’t remember much after that,” she says.Her husband Dev Chandra was hauled off to the Dantewada police station. Like Rae Bareilly’s Saroj, Kartami found then that they had been charged under the anti-conversion law. So began the seven-year journey.Looking back at why they were targeted, Kartami says there is a prevalence of superstition and black magic in their community. “My husband, a govt school teacher, was not doing well. But in 2003, he accepted Christianity and started progressing both in his work and personal life. After that, he was frequently accused of converting people even when he was sharing a word of comfort or advice,” she says.The same year as the Dantewada couple, Maharashtra resident Prabhakar Sule, 47, who lives in Jalgaon district, was booked in an anti-conversion case. He was visiting MP’s Khandwa for a prayer meeting when the group was attacked. “My wife and I were dragged to the police station like criminals. My children, who live in hostels, had no idea of our whereabouts for three days,” he says.Sule’s case was registered in Khandwa, 120 km away from his home. For seven years, the couple had to travel for court appearances before they were cleared in 2024. “Earlier, I was scared at the sight of khaki but now I don’t feel that dread anymore. The worst has already happened,” he says.","Eleven states, including gujarat, himachal pradesh, up and karnataka, have anti-conversion laws.
