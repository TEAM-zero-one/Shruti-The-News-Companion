"Garhwal villages ban costly gifts, fast food at weddings",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/garhwal-villages-ban-costly-gifts-fast-food-at-weddings/articleshow/125528766.cms,"DEHRADUN: Nearly two dozen villages in Uttarakhand’s Chakrata region have collectively banned fast food, lavish gifts and high-cost customs at weddings to curb rising social pressure and restore traditional practices. The rules, agreed upon unanimously by village representatives in the Jaunsar Bawar area, aim to return wedding celebrations to their cultural roots and reduce financial strain on families. Anyone violating the norms will be fined Rs 1 lakh by the gram panchayat.Rajender Tomar, head of the Doha village cluster, told TOI that the increasing display of wealth during weddings had created unhealthy competition in the region. “These customs were becoming a competition and creating unnecessary pressure,” he said. Villages including Dau, Doha, Chutou, Bajau, Ghingo and Kaitri are among those enforcing the new policy.As part of the decision, food items such as chowmein, momos and other fastfood snacks have been barred from wedding menus. Families are encouraged to serve traditional Garhwali cuisine made from local ingredients such as mandua and jhingora millets.The exchange of expensive gifts and luxury items has also been prohibited. Karmu Pal, a resident of Kyawa village, supported the move. “We’re happy our local cuisine and culture are being promoted. The new generation won’t forget where they come from.”The sentiment echoed in neighbouring Naugaon in Uttarkashi, where residents of Koti Thakral and Koti Banal agreed to ban DJ music and alcohol at weddings. Traditional folk music and local instrumentswill be mandatory at celebrations.","Nearly two dozen villages in uttarakhand’s chakrata region have collectively banned fast food, lavish gifts and high-cost customs at weddings.

Police outpost comes up at seat of Reds’ Jantana Sarkar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/police-outpost-comes-up-at-seat-of-reds-jantana-sarkar/articleshow/125528705.cms,"The camp becomes the eighth police installation in Abujmarh since 2023

NAGPUR: Maharashtra forces on Sunday pushed deeper into Abujmarh than ever before, establishing a fortified police outpost in a lightning 24-hour operation at Phulnar — an isolated village in south Gadchiroli’s Bhamragarh division near the Chhattisgarh border — long regarded as the CPI (Maoist) command spine where insurgents once dictated life and law.Camp Gundurwahi stands exactly where the Maoists ran their Jantana Sarkar — the parallel govt that controlled the “Red Corridor” of Leftwing extremism for more than five decades. The camp becomes the eighth police installation in Abujmarh since 2023, marking the deepest penetration into India’s most entrenched Maoist belt.The breakthrough aligns with Union home minister Amit Shah’s target of ending Maoist insurgency by March 31, 2026, through a mix of intelligence-driven security operations and rapid development in tribal belts. Shah has ruled out talks with armed groups, urging cadres to surrender and join mainstream life under the Centre’s rehabilitation policy.For years, Phulnar–Gundurwahi functioned as an impenetrable headquarters. PLGA fighters marched in olive green. Landmines and ambushes made even approaches kilometres away perilous. Reaching Phulnar was impossible for seven months due to flooding of the Parlakota river in monsoon.The remaining months were barred by PLGA guns. “Now, the Tricolour will fly here,” a senior officer said.The outpost was completed in a round-the-clock operation involving 1,050 personnel, including 1,000 C-60 commandos, 21 bomb-disposal squads, new constables, 500 special police officers, CRPF companies and private contractors. A convoy of four JCB bulldozers, seven trailers, two Poclain earthmoving machines and 25 trucks carved out a fully functional base with 12 porta cabins, Wi-Fi, RO plants, generator backup, toilets, watchtowers and bunkers.Phulnar, barely 4km from Chhattisgarh and 20km from Bhamragarh, once housed the feared Company No. 10 of PLGA — responsible for the 2016 kidnapping and killing of a C-60 commando. Months ago, security forces gunned down four of its cadres.Villagers repeatedly resisted police entry and openly backed Maoists until recently. Sunday signalled a sharp turn. More than 300 tribal residents from 10 surrounding villages attended the inauguration and Jan Jagran Melawa — a “people’s awakening” function. ADG (special operations) Chhering Dorje and Gadchiroli SP Neelotpal presided over the event.Neelotpal said work would resume on roads, bridges, mobile towers at Koparshi and Phulnar, and a sub-primary health centre, followed by state transport buses. “Improved security will finally allow seamless connectivity between Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, boosting commerce and development,” he said.Police launched a large civic outreach — distributing saris, blankets, utensils, mosquito nets, school kits, sports gear and food items while explaining govt schemes and peace benefits.","Camp gundurwahi stands exactly where the maoists ran their jantana sarkar.

Ex-HC CJ not in ambit of detailed in-house proceedings

The CJI said he had sought a report from NCLAT judicial member Justice Sharad Kumar Sharma who had startled everyone by disclosing in open court on Aug 13 that ""one of the most revered members of the higher judiciary of this country"" had approached him to secure a favourable order and recused himself from hearing the case.The CJI said by the time Justice Sharma sent a detailed report, the HC chief justice in question had retired; thus, a formal in-house inquiry could not be ordered against the errant member of the judiciary.The CJI said that shortly after he initiated deliberations among his colleagues over the process or procedure to be adopted to weed out such attempts in future, the President appointed Justice Surya Kant as his successor to the post of CJI. ""That is why I thought it better to leave it to the new CJI to take appropriate action on the issue,"" he said.The retired HC CJ is out of the ambit of detailed in-house proceedings, an adverse finding in which could persuade the CJI to recommend govt to initiate a motion in Parliament for the judge's removal. However, he may not be completely out of the arc of accountability as the new CJI, Justice Surya Kant, could still recommend registration of FIR under Prevention of Corruption Act.On November 14, addressing the matter, a bench of CJI-designate Justice Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi had told advocate Prashant Bhushan, who was appearing for a petitioner, that ""action will have to be initiated at the highest level (of the judiciary, that is the CJI) against the one who attempted to interfere with the administration of justice. If Supreme Court takes up this issue on the judicial side, then it would run counter to the power vested in the highest authority. The highest authority cannot be guided by judicial orders to take a decision.""Noting the seriousness of the matter, the bench had said that under the existing legal framework for fixing accountability on constitutional court judges, the issue raised by the petitioner should be dealt with on the administrative side.","The cji said he had sought a report from nclat judicial member justice sharad kumar sharma.

NEW DELHI: Amid the political row kicked up by the proposed constitutional amendment to bring Chandigarh under the ambit of Article 240, home ministry Sunday clarified that the proposal neither ""seeks to alter Chandigarh's governance or administrative structure"" nor ""change the traditional arrangements between Chandigarh and the states of Punjab and Haryana"".In a post on X, the home ministry held out the reassurance that the central govt has no intention of introducing any Bill on the issue in the upcoming winter session of Parliament.The statement followed protests from political parties in Punjab which claimed that the proposed amendment to put the administration of Chandigarh under a lieutenant governor, in line with other Union territories which don't have assemblies, was an attempt to weaken Punjab's control over the UT.The parties were reacting to a Lok Sabha bulletin listing the bills the govt could consider moving in the Winter session.

GURGAON: A seven-year-old boy playing outside his house with his father was crushed to death by a car being driven by a teenager in Maruti Kunj on Friday evening.Witnesses recalled the sudden roar of a Maruti SX4 as it sped down the narrow lane and crashed into Yohan, a Class II student. The boy was dragged for almost 20 metres on the bonnet of the car before the 15-year-old driver slammed the brakes.“It all happened in a flash. The car was going too fast for a lane as narrow as this. We heard a loud thud and rushed out to see what had happened,” said a local resident.Yohan was the only son of Ashwani Kumar, a building materials supplier and his schoolteacher wife.Residents gathered at the scene, pulled the underage driver out of the vehicle and informed police. Yohan’s family rushed him to Artemis Hospital, but he had succumbed to injuries by then.The incident left the neighbourhood shocked. “Our children play here every day. We never imagined something like this could happen right at our doorstep,” said a neighbour.An FIR was registered at Bhondsi police station under sections 106 (causing death by negligence) and 281 (rash driving) of BNS. Preliminary probe revealed that the car was not registered in the name of the minor’s father, who works for a private company.“We are trying to find out the actual owner of the car,” said an officer, adding that the vehicle could have been recently purchased second hand without updating registration records.","Yohan was dragged for almost 20 metres on the bonnet of the car before the 15-year-old driver slammed the brakes.

IAF Officer Namansh Syal Flown Back to India After Tejas Jet Crash in Dubai Air Show

How the tragic mishap occurred?

NEW DELHI: Wing Commander Afshan saluted her husband, Wing Commander Namansh Syal, as she paid her last respects to him.Wing Commander Namansh Syal lost his life in the LCA Tejas crash in Dubai on 21st November.The mortal remains of Wing Commander Namansh Syal were brought to his native village of Patialkar in Himachal Pradesh’s Kangra district on Sunday.Villagers, family members and officials gathered to pay emotional tributes as his last rites are set to be performed.The Indian Air Force (IAF) confirmed the pilot’s demise after the aircraft crashed and burst into flames during a low-level aerobatic demonstration at Al Maktoum International Airport, Dubai on Friday.Local residents and friends described Syal as a “gem” and the pride of their village and school.Sandeep Kumar, a local, said, “We are from the same village as Namansh, Patialkar. Everyone in our village is sad. He was like our younger brother. This should not have happened. We do not have words. We met him 3-4 months ago when he visited our village.”Pankaj Chadha, who studied alongside Wing Commander Namansh Syal, recalled their school days and how he was a gem.""I have also studied in the same school as Namansh, Sainik School Sujanpur Tira. We have lost one of our gems. He was the pride of our school. We will go to his native village, Patialkar. He made all of us very proud,"" Chadha said.The Tejas Mark-1 fighter jet was performing an eight-minute aerobatic demonstration when it could not recover from a low-altitude “negative G-turn,” plunging to the ground and erupting into flames in front of a large audience.Visuals from the Dubai Air Show showed the jet crashing and sending thick black smoke into the sky. Emergency teams rushed to the site, but Wing Commander Syal could not eject in time and sustained fatal injuries.This was the second crash involving the lightweight multi-role Tejas since its induction into the IAF a decade ago. The first crash, near Jaisalmer in March last year, saw the pilot safely eject. The IAF has ordered a court of inquiry to ascertain the cause of the crash, coordinating with Dubai aviation authorities and recovering the aircraft’s black box.Veteran pilots highlight that such accidents can occur due to sudden loss of power, control malfunction or spatial disorientation during negative G maneuvers","Wing commander namansh syal lost his life in the lca tejas crash in dubai on 21st november.

'Nothing to say': Kharge on Karnataka power tussle; Cong chief says party high command will decide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nothing-to-say-kharge-on-karnataka-power-tussle-cong-chief-says-party-high-command-will-decide/articleshow/125520012.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid persistent speculation over a possible change of chief minister in Karnataka, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Sunday said the party high command will take a call, adding that he had “nothing to say now.”His comments came a day after he held a meeting of over an hour with chief minister Siddaramaiah “I have nothing to say about the developments that have happened. So you standing here is a waste of your time and I too feel bad. Whatever it is, the high command will do it. There is no need for you to worry more about it,” Kharge told reporters outside his residence, as quoted by PTI.Speculation around leadership change has intensified after the Congress government crossed the halfway mark of its five-year term on November 20, triggering renewed talk on whether the party will revisit the power-sharing understanding between Siddaramaiah and deputy CM D K Shivakumar After his meeting with Kharge on Saturday - the second in less than a week - Siddaramaiah said he would abide by the party’s decision on his tenure. He, however, described the buzz around a leadership change as “speculation and media creation.”The meeting followed visits by several MLAs reportedly aligned with Shivakumar to Delhi to meet Kharge as the government completed 2.5 years. Shivakumar has denied knowledge of any such meetings.On Sunday, ministers H C Mahadevappa and K Venkatesh, both seen as close to the CM, also met Kharge.Party insiders say the immediate point of friction is Siddaramaiah’s push for a cabinet reshuffle, while Shivakumar’s supporters want clarity on any leadership change before that. Approval for a reshuffle, they say, would signal that Siddaramaiah is set to complete a full term, reducing the chances of Shivakumar moving into the top post.Following the Congress victory in the May 2023 Assembly elections, Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar had engaged in a keen contest for the chief ministership before the party settled on Siddaramaiah and made Shivakumar his deputy. There were reports then of a “rotational chief minister” understanding after 2.5 years, though the party never confirmed it.(With input from agency)",Congress president mallikarjun kharge says the party high command will take a call.

EC To Launch SIR in 12 States and UTs in Phase 2, CEC Gyanesh Kumar Says Zero Complaints in Bihar

Rahul Gandhi's X post on SIR

Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on Sunday alleged that “chaos” has gripped the country in the name of the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, claiming that 16 Booth Level Officers (BLOs) have died due to work-related stress.The SIR exercise is currently under way in nine States and three Union Territories. Its first phase was conducted in Bihar ahead of the State’s Assembly elections.“Under the guise of SIR, chaos has been unleashed across the country - the result? In three weeks, 16 BLOs have lost their lives. Heart attacks, stress, suicides - SIR is no reform, it's an imposed tyranny,” Rahul Gandhi said in a post on X in Hindi.“SIR is a calculated ploy - where citizens are being harassed and the deaths of BLOs from unnecessary pressure are dismissed as ‘collateral damage.’ This is not a failure, it's a conspiracy - a sacrifice of democracy to protect those in power,” the Congress MP alleged.A media report shared by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge stated that 16 BLOs have died across six States — four each in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, three in West Bengal, two in Rajasthan, and one each in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.Following the death of a BLO in West Bengal that triggered a political dispute, governor CV Ananda Bose on Sunday said that the passing of Shanti Muni Ekka, who allegedly died by suicide due to “unbearable pressure” from SIR-related duties, would be examined thoroughly.“In such a situation, it is better to avoid a knee-jerk reaction. What the Chief Minister said has to be examined in detail. I am sure we have an Election Commission which is strong enough and has a balanced outlook. All these issues can be examined properly and appropriate solutions found, but what is required is free and fair elections in this country,” the governor said.The final electoral roll is scheduled to be published on February 7, 2026.The States and Union Territories currently undergoing SIR include Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Kerala, Lakshadweep, Madhya Pradesh, Puducherry, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.Meanwhile, the Trinamool Congress will hold an internal review meeting on November 24, chaired by party general secretary Abhishek Banerjee. The meeting will focus on SIR-related assessments, improvements across districts, and ensuring that no voter names are omitted.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee is also scheduled to meet members of the Matua community in Bongaon, North 24 Parganas, on November 25.","Rahul gandhi claims 16 booth level officers (blos) have died due to work-related stress.

What does the Election Commission say?





CEC Gyanesh Kumar on SIR

Tech-driven SIR

NEW DELHI: Across India, from big metros to small towns and remote settlements, a quiet but significant exercise is under way to refresh the country’s voter rolls. The Special Intensive Revision, or SIR, has Booth Level Officers visiting homes with updated lists, seeking confirmations and corrections as they work through one of the world’s largest electoral databases.What began as routine verification has unexpectedly drawn intense national attention, sparking debate and renewed curiosity about how India’s most fundamental democratic document is kept accurate.As the Election Commission races to update the rolls ahead of crucial elections, political parties are sounding the alarm. They argue that SIR, instead of merely removing duplication, could alter electoral equations by disproportionately affecting certain voter groups.With the Supreme Court in the loop, opposition concerns mounting and millions engaging with the process, the political mood is one of cautious anticipation. A question is now beginning to surface as the exercise unfolds.Backing the poll body's decision to carry out this intensive exercise, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar has said that ""pure electoral rolls are inevitable for strengthening democracy.""""The world's biggest voter list purification exercise was conducted in Bihar alone, and once the drive is extended to 51 crore voters in 12 states, it will mark a historic achievement for the Election Commission and the nation,"" Gyanesh Kumar added.However, more than a technical administrative task, it has become a political saga, carrying legal, constitutional and social implications that go to the heart of India’s most elemental democratic right. The vote.SIR rests on one of the most powerful lines in the Indian Constitution. Article 324 hands the Election Commission the sweeping authority to run the country’s elections. Not just the voting day spectacle, but everything that makes it possible.This single provision gives the Commission the right to step in whenever it believes the integrity of the process needs attention, including the upkeep of the voter list.That constitutional muscle is reinforced by the Representation of the People Act, 1950, which doesn’t just permit revisions of the electoral roll but explicitly allows the Commission to go beyond the usual annual updates. The law opens the door for deeper, more exhaustive exercises when the situation demands it, and the Registration of Electors Rules lay out the procedures to follow.In other words, SIR isn’t an improvisation but a legally grounded tool designed for moments when the regular maintenance of the rolls isn’t enough.While most years witness a “summary revision” focusing on new eligibles and basic updates, SIR is distinct. It combines a full-fledged house-to-house enumeration, rigorous document verification, and mass data audits.India’s first major enumeration drives date to the early post-independence years, under the Representation of the People Acts of 1950 and 1951. The earliest “intensive” revisions built the foundational voter rolls, but as the population grew and people’s mobility increased, summary revisions became the norm.While a Summary Revision focuses on new eligibles and routine corrections, SIR goes far deeper, involving statewide house-to-house verification, detailed scrutiny of entries, and large-scale data audits.For instance, under a Summary Revision, a voter who has shifted homes must file a form to update their address. Under SIR, the Booth Level Officer visits that address, confirms whether the voter still lives there, checks if anyone new has become eligible, and updates the roll based on physical verification rather than waiting for the voter to initiate the change.The political storm around the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) has intensified, with the Congress preparing a major protest rally in Delhi in the first week of December to oppose what it called a “politically motivated” overhaul of voter rolls.Congress leader KC Venugopal alleged that the Election Commission was acting “at the behest of the BJP,” while Rahul Gandhi has described SIR as an attempt to “institutionalise vote theft.”The confrontation has also shifted to the courts, with both the Trinamool Congress and the DMK moving the Supreme Court against the ongoing revision in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, arguing that compressed timelines and inconsistencies in the process risk disenfranchising genuine voters.Opposition parties collectively claim that the timing of the SIR, the scale of proposed deletions in states like Bihar, and alleged procedural lapses point to an attempt to skew the electoral field ahead of crucial polls, particularly impacting migrants, minorities and other vulnerable voter groups.Poll-bound states are sharply split over the SIR of electoral rolls, with three chief ministers from West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, attacking the process, while Assam has been kept out of the exercise this year.In Assam, chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the Election Commission ""could not"" conduct SIR because “the NRC has not yet been notified.”He said SIR requires NRC data to verify citizenship and added that “in Assam’s case, notification is still pending.” The ECI has instead ordered a Special Summary Revision, which the state “fully supports.”Sarma said the aim is an “error-free and foreigner-free” voters’ list and that SIR will be taken up next year after the NRC notification.Union home minister Amit Shah has also said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fully supports the Election Commission’s Special Intensive Revision, describing it as an essential exercise to cleanse the electoral rolls, PTI reported. Shah also took aim at the Congress’ ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ in Bihar, claiming the opposition launched the campaign to “save infiltrators,” and alleging that the party “wants to win elections with their help. ”West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has been the strongest critic, calling the process dangerous and rushed. Referring to the deaths of booth-level officers, she asked: “How many more lives will be lost? How many more need to die for this SIR?” She has termed the rollout “unplanned, chaotic and dangerous.”Mamata Banerjee has also written a strongly worded letter to CEC Gyanesh Kumar, urging him to stop the SIR.Tamil Nadu chief minister M.K. Stalin called SIR “flawed, confusing, and dangerous,” warning that forms are so complex that “even well-educated people will have their heads spinning.” He alleged political intent, saying, “If you cannot defeat us, you seek to delete us.”Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan called the EC’s move “a challenge to the democratic process,” criticising the use of old data formats and warning it could “undermine the public mandate.”With three states objecting to the process and Assam opting out due to pending NRC notification, the SIR rollout has emerged as one of the most politically charged administrative exercises ahead of the 2026 electoral season.Before the Bihar polls, CEC Gyanesh Kumar claimed the first phase of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in Bihar had concluded “without a single appeal,” signalling what the Election Commission views as a smooth and uncontested verification process.The state’s electorate now stands at 7.42 crore, down from 7.89 crore before SIR, a reduction of nearly 47 lakh from the old rolls. However, compared to the draft roll published on August 1, which had removed 65 lakh names on grounds such as death, migration and duplication, the final tally actually shows an increase.A total of 21.53 lakh new voters were added after the draft publication, while 3.66 lakh names were removed, resulting in a net gain of 17.87 lakh electors between the draft and final lists. The EC said the final numbers reflected corrections made during claims and objections and demonstrate the scale of the verification process undertaken under SIR.The Election Commission has defended the Special Intensive Revision as a routine but essential clean-up of the country’s electoral rolls, insisting the exercise is aimed at making voter lists “transparent, accurate and fully inclusive.”In a detailed press brief, the Commission said the purpose of SIR is to ensure that all eligible citizens are added and no ineligible names remain, describing it as part of a broader effort to create “error-free” rolls across states.Responding to criticism from opposition parties, the Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar told reporters that “misinformation” was being spread about the process, accusing some leaders of “firing from the Election Commission’s shoulder.”The EC had also clarified discrepancies flagged in Bihar, saying that additions made after the draft roll were within rules that allow updates until ten days before nominations.The Election Commission is leaning heavily on digital tools to execute the Special Intensive Revision, with a mix of citizen-facing apps and backend platforms supporting the massive house-to-house verification exercise.Voters can use the Voter Helpline app and the ECI portal to check their registration status, download or submit forms, correct entries and, in some cases, even book a call with their Booth Level Officer (BLO). These tools allow electors to view pre-filled details pulled from legacy rolls and upload missing documents online, reducing duplication and easing the administrative burden during the nationwide verification drive.On the field side, officials rely on the BLO App (formerly Garuda), a mobile platform used for house-to-house verification, confirming voter residence, updating addresses, and capturing photographs and GPS-tagged data.The app also lets BLOs record polling-station facilities and track verification progress in real time, feeding directly into supervisory dashboards.The Special Intensive Revision has emerged as more than an administrative exercise. It now sits at the intersection of politics, perception and democratic trust.Whether SIR ultimately strengthens the integrity of India’s voter rolls or deepens existing doubts will depend not only on the Election Commission’s execution, but also on how transparently the process is communicated and how responsibly political parties engage with it.","The special intensive revision, or sir, has booth level officers visiting homes with updated lists. It combines a full-fledged house-to-house enumeration, rigorous document verification, and mass data audits. Chief election commissioner (cec) gyanesh kumar has said that pure electoral rolls are inevitable for strengthening democracy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125518373,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-94492,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

It was DLTGH 50 (days left to go home) at National Defence Academy (NDA). Morning announcements at squadrons were now beginning with this cheerful count. Mid-term had passed. Termbreak — and home — were only a few weeks away when the Oct 10 morning muster in Charlie Squadron reported a missing firsttermer, Cadet Antriksh Kumar Singh.The 18-year-old was found dead in his cabin. It was the third suicide in NDA since 2014. The Lucknow boy had cleared Services Selection Board (SSB) in his first attempt and was by all accounts a very bright student. What drove him beyond the edge?Less than two weeks later, tragedy struck again. This time in the swimming pool. Bravo Squadron first-termer Aditya D Yadav, a weak swimmer, was being put through extra lessons to clear his mandatory test when he drowned.Just how he died in the presence of six instructors, other cadets and officers is not known yet.Police investigations are on into both incidents. NDA is holding a court of inquiry. Both families have alleged a conspiracy and demanded ‘impartial investigations’.The back-to-back deaths at India’s premier military academy have triggered a deep introspection within defence and training circles about SSB, the training regimen and the psychological resilience expected of boys and girls fresh out of school.Selection for NDA is one of the most gruelling in the world — some 6 lakh sign up for just 406 seats. After clearing a UPSC written exam, candidates have to undergo an SSB interview process that lasts four days for those that clear screening. Then, there are medical tests. It’s after this multi-layered filtering that cadets earn the right to wear the Ashoka emblem on their NDA beret.Then comes training. Often, night merges into sleepless night after the day’s soul-sapping ‘ ragda ’ for first-termers. “Forget the drill square or PT grounds, merely surviving from reveille to lights-out in the squadron was a challenge in my ‘ Ikki ’ (first-termer) days,” recalled an NDA alumnus, who later joined as an instructor. “The process of forging boys into soldiers needs to be hard on mind and body. Unfortunately, sometimes tragedies happen. My heart goes out to the families of these cadets.”While the two deaths occurred under different circumstances, they are an indication of the immense adjustment pressures first-term cadets face.There have been nine deaths at NDA in the last two decades, three of them suicides. Cadets quitting training is also a major concern. A 2018 news report, quoting a report jointly prepared by Integrated Defence Staff Headquarters and NDA, revealed that between Jan 2008 and Nov 2017, as many as 1,256 cadets quit NDA, or a good 16-20% of intake every year.So, what’s going wrong?spoke to former SSB assessors, NDA instructors and former commandants and deputy commandants and a common voice emerged: the need to introduce systemic reforms that can ensure cadet safety without compromising on toughness.A consensus among several former SSB presidents and instructors is that the problem begins much before cadets even reach NDA. They point out that while the SSB process rigorously tests the mental makeup of a candidate, there is a need for a more uniform and scientific physical assessment system during the selection process itself.Candidates who fare poorly on the individual obstacle course may still get recommended if they are found fit otherwise — but the physical weakness shows up in NDA’s gruelling pace. Many candidates can’t cope with the sheer physical demands and drop out or get injured or worse.On Feb 11, 2022, defence minister Rajnath Singh informed Lok Sabha that 211 cadets had been discharged from NDA, IMA (Indian Military Academy in Dehradun) and OTA (Officers Training Academy, in Chennai and Gaya) in the previous 10 years as disabled and medically unfit for service.Experts suggest that like soldier recruitment rallies, a standardised physical test — based on measurable, uniform parameters — should be introduced for officer aspirants as well. Additionally, they recommend that cadets undergo comprehensive physical fitness assessments upon reporting to NDA.“Without a scientific baseline, how can the academy know if a cadet has weak leg muscles or poor endurance?” asked a retired physical training officer. “Instead of asking a new cadet to run a few kilometres within days of joining, the academy should build endurance gradually. Those who fail to meet standards after progressive training can then be screened out,” he suggested.“The individual obstacle test at SSB includes activities like ‘Tarzan jump’, vertical rope climbing or Burma bridge-crossing — things most civilian students have never done. Candidates from non-military schools find this difficult because it’s completely new to them,” said Brigadier Laxmicharan Patnaik, former president of an SSB centre.Brigadier Jay Konnur, former president of SSB Centre-Bangalore, acknowledged that physical standards often receive less attention during selection.“Candidates are asked to complete 10 obstacles in three minutes. We observe determination, not absolute physical capability. If a candidate manages even six, we tend to overlook the shortfall. That may not reflect the actual physical preparedness required for NDA training,” he said, adding that SSB’s focus on leadership and group dynamics often overshadows baseline fitness.“Once they reach NDA, every shortcoming becomes magnified in a far more demanding environment,” he pointed out.They are equally vocal about the need for improved and sustained psychological evaluations. “Psychological tests at SSBs are not foolproof,” said Patnaik, who was also chairman of Odisha Public Service Commission. “Repeated and deeper assessments at the academy are essential.”He feels NDA should appoint a dedicated team of psychologists to conduct regular evaluations and build a psychological dossier for each cadet.“These young men are future leaders of the armed forces. Understanding their emotional and mental resilience early can prevent breakdowns later,” Patnaik pointed out, adding that psychological counselling should be made a “normal and de-stigmatised part” of cadet life. “If we normalise counselling, first-termers will open up more. Confidential sessions can help them regain confidence and adjust to the demanding environment,” he said.“Cadets from civilian backgrounds face a stunning culture shock in the first term. They are not accustomed to the regimentation, physical demands or the sheer mental toughness that’s asked of them,” said an NDA alumnus. The academy has a system of counselling but what it needs is professional counsellors, said another alumnus.According to Major General Shukla, former commandant of SSB centre-Bhopal, the problem is compounded by interpersonal challenges within squadrons.“First-term cadets are often under immense pressure to prove themselves. Some seniors, driven by tradition or competition, unintentionally humiliate or overburden them. Sensitising senior cadets about mentorship is essential. They must handhold, not intimidate,” he said, remarking that effective mentorship and emotional support from senior cadets can ease this transition provided it is guided and monitored by officers. “Else, the same system that is meant to help may break them,” he cautioned.The “buddy system” — where every fresher is mentored by a senior cadet (overstudy) — has come under sharp scrutiny after recent incidents. Several parents, including serving officers, allege the system often crosses ethical and physical boundaries.“There are cases where seniors ask juniors to perform dangerous activities in the name of maintaining squadron honour,” said a source. “A second-term cadet suffered serious neck injuries when a senior asked him to perform a dive roll — a test the senior himself had not passed. The case is under consideration and the injured cadet is likely to board out on medical grounds.”Antriksh’s parents have alleged that his overstudy ragged him relentlessly. That is yet to be borne out in the police probe.The ‘fauji’ father of a medically boarded-out cadet said, “Each squadron competes fiercely in swimming, cross-country, or equestrian events. Seniors push juniors to unrealistic limits to maintain their reputation. This is neither scientific nor fair. This practice needs to be stopped.”However, former NDA commandants defend the mentorship tradition, insisting that when implemented correctly, it helps cadets adapt to a tough environment.Lt Gen Asit Mistry (retd), a former NDA commandant, said, “The buddy system has existed for decades and works effectively. Senior cadets help newcomers cope with the rigours of training. It’s unclear what went wrong in these cases, but the concept is sound.”Another former commandant added, “There is no scope for ragging or unscientific practices. Each squadron has officers specifically responsible for cadet welfare, who personally monitor stress and morale. Deviations must be dealt with seriously.”Ex-NDAs fiercely defend the academy’s ethos, and its emphasis on physical and mental toughness, pointing out that the system has produced three Param Vir Chakras, 12 Ashoka Chakras, 32 Mahavir Chakras and 160 Vir Chakras.But officers have also acknowledged the existence of what they term “unscientific traditions” — informal endurance practices not sanctioned but culturally ingrained. “These sessions are not officially part of the training schedule. But they are often conducted by senior cadets in the name of toughening them up. It can lead to injuries or psychological breakdowns,” said a former physical training officer.Another veteran observed that while the intention may be to foster toughness, such practices must be replaced with structured, scientific endurance programmes. “We must stop romanticising suffering as character-building. A soldier’s resilience should be built through method, not shock,” he suggested.Another alumnus recalled his own early struggles: “In my first term, I felt completely out of place. I couldn’t meet the standards and thought of quitting. It was only in the third term that I regained confidence. The system is harsh — but it shouldn’t break you before it builds you.”An officer who was part of the TriServices Committee, which tried to reform practices at training academies in 2003, said barracks punishments are the reasons for suicides and should be stopped immediately. “Most armies have changed it. Punishments can be military-ways, but harassment during night or odd hours should end immediately,” he toldon the condition of anonymity. “The academy must evolve with the times,” said Major General Shukla. “We cannot afford to lose bright young minds to outdated systems. The goal is not to dilute training, but to make it safer, smarter, and more humane.”As the investigations into the two deaths continue, the hope is that the tragedy will become a catalyst for long-overdue change — one that ensures no more dreams are extinguished in the process of building the nation’s defenders.Far from the institutional debate lies the anguish of devastated families. Rubikumari Yadav, mother of first-termer Aditya Yadav, said her life has been shattered. “My son dreamed of serving the nation, and now I am left with nothing. The academy says there was no fault. Who is responsible for my son’s death then?” she asked.Antriksh’s family says he faced intense pressure and humiliation from a senior cadet. “He topped his school and was full of dreams,” said his uncle, A P Sengar. “But he couldn’t bear the pressure. This is not training — it’s trauma.”Reacting to the allegations levelled by Antriksh’s parents, then NDA commandant Vice-Admiral Gurcharan Singh told, “It is a regrettable incident. He was a good cadet and performing well. We are in touch with the family and extending all possible assistance. A court of inquiry has been ordered to ascertain the facts.”But that’s little consolation for Rubikumari. “At the end of the day, I lost my son — and they lost one of the nation’s best,” she said.| Cadet Aditya D Yadav dies during swimming session| Cadet Antriksh Kumar Singh dies by suicide| Gentleman Cadet S Balu dies during a swimming session| Gentleman Cadet Kumbhar Atharv Sambhaji dies during cross country run| Gentleman Cadet Umang Khar dies from a heat stroke| Cadet R Rabijith dies during training| Cadets follow a clear hierarchy within each squadron, ensuring continuous guidance.

Why the controversy erupted?



NEW DELHI: The ministry of home affairs on Sunday clarified that the central government had no intention to introduce any bill to ""alter Chandigarh’s governance or administrative structure"" in the upcoming Winter Session of Parliament.This came after a political row erupted over its plans to place Chandigarh under Article 240 of the Constitution through the 131st Amendment Bill in the upcoming winter session, bringing it in line with UTs such as the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and Daman and Diu.""The proposal only to simplify the Central Government’s law-making process for the Union Territory of Chandigarh is still under consideration with the Central Government. No final decision has been taken on this proposal. The proposal in no way seeks to alter Chandigarh’s governance or administrative structure, nor does it aim to change the traditional arrangements between Chandigarh and the States of Punjab or Haryana,"" MHA said in a statement.""A suitable decision will be taken only after adequate consultations with all stakeholders, keeping in mind the interests of Chandigarh.There is no need for any concern on this matter. The Central Government has no intention of introducing any Bill to this effect in the upcoming Winter Session of Parliament,"" it added.The BJP-led Centre had proposed bringing the Union Territory of Chandigarh under Article 240 of the Constitution. This would allow the President to appoint a lieutenant governor for the city and make regulations directly. The MHA, however, clarified that the proposal would ""simplify the Central Government’s law-making process Chandigarh"" and it was ""still under consideration with the Central Government.""The move triggered sharp reactions across Punjab’s political spectrum, with several leaders calling it an attack on Punjab’s rights over Chandigarh.Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann strongly criticised the move, calling it “a conspiracy to snatch” Punjab’s capital. In his statement, he said “Chandigarh was, is and will always remain an integral part of the state.” Mann argued that Punjab, as the “parent state,” has full rights over Chandigarh and accused the Centre of acting unjustly.If cleared, the proposal could allow the Centre to appoint an independent administrator for Chandigarh, similar to how the UT earlier had its own chief secretary. The idea already met strong opposition from the ruling Aam Aadmi Party, Congress, and Shiromani Akali Dal.AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal also launched a sharp attack on the central government. In a post on X, he said the proposed amendment was “a direct assault on Punjab’s identity and its constitutional rights” and accused the Centre of “tearing apart the federal structure”. He added that Punjab was being deprived of its rightful share, writing that it amounted to “wounding the very soul of Punjab”. He declared that “Chandigarh belongs to Punjab and shall remain Punjab’s”.Chandigarh currently serves as the shared capital of Punjab and Haryana. For decades, both states have claimed full rights over the city, but it has remained a Union Territory since 1966.","The central government had no intention to introduce any bill to ""alter chandigarh’s governance or administrative structure"" in the upcoming winter session of parliament.

How the tragic mishap occurred?

NEW DELHI: The mortal remains of Wing Commander Namansh Syal, who lost his life in the Tejas fighter jet crash during the Dubai Air Show 2025, were brought to his native village of Patialkar in Himachal Pradesh’s Kangra district on Sunday.Villagers, family members and officials gathered to pay emotional tributes as his last rites are set to be performed.The Indian Air Force (IAF) confirmed the pilot’s demise after the aircraft crashed and burst into flames during a low-level aerobatic demonstration at Al Maktoum International Airport, Dubai on Friday.Local residents and friends described Syal as a “gem” and the pride of their village and school.Sandeep Kumar, a local, said, “""We are from the same village as Namansh, Patialkar. Everyone in our village is sad. He was like our younger brother. This should not have happened. We do not have words. We met him 3-4 months ago when he visited our village.”Pankaj Chadha, who studied alongside Wing Commander Namansh Syal, recalled their school days and how he was a gem.""I have also studied in the same school as Namansh, Sainik School Sujanpur Tira. We have lost one of our gems. He was the pride of our school.We will go to his native village, Patialkar. He made all of us very proud,"" Chadha said.The mortal remains were flown from Dubai to Sulur Air Base in Coimbatore earlier in the day, where Coimbatore District Collector Pavankumar G. Giriyappanavar, Superintendent of Police Dr K Karthikeyan and IAF officials paid floral tributes. The Emirati Defence Forces also accorded Syal a ceremonial guard of honour in recognition of his bravery and service.Wing Commander Namansh Syal, 37, hailed from Patialkar village in Nagrota Bagwan tehsil of Kangra district, Himachal Pradesh. He was posted at Sulur Air Force Station in Tamil Nadu and was attached to No 45 Squadron, the “Tejas Daggers” of the IAF.Syal, an experienced fighter pilot, was a graduate of Sainik School Sujanpur Tira, Hamirpur and the National Defence Academy (NDA). He trained with the Hunter Squadron at the Air Force Academy and earned his wings with distinction.His father, Jagannath Syal, is an ex-armyman who later became a teacher, while his wife, Afsaan, also serves as a Wing Commander at Sulur Air Base. The couple has a seven-year-old daughter.Himachal Pradesh chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu paid tribute, calling Syal a “courageous, dutiful, and valiant pilot”. He added that “the nation has lost a brave son of Kangra district.”Defence minister Rajnath Singh expressing his grief wrote in a post on X, “Deeply anguished at the loss of a brave and courageous IAF pilot during an aerial display in Dubai Air Show. My heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family. The nation stands firmly with the family in this tragic hour.”Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan also offered condolences, affirming the armed forces’ solidarity with the family.The Tejas Mark-1 fighter jet was performing an eight-minute aerobatic demonstration when it could not recover from a low-altitude “negative G-turn,” plunging to the ground and erupting into flames in front of a large audience.Visuals from the Dubai Air Show showed the jet crashing and sending thick black smoke into the sky. Emergency teams rushed to the site, but Wing Commander Syal could not eject in time and sustained fatal injuries.This was the second crash involving the lightweight multi-role Tejas since its induction into the IAF a decade ago. The first crash, near Jaisalmer in March last year, saw the pilot safely eject. The IAF has ordered a court of inquiry to ascertain the cause of the crash, coordinating with Dubai aviation authorities and recovering the aircraft’s black box.Veteran pilots highlight that such accidents can occur due to sudden loss of power, control malfunction or spatial disorientation during negative G maneuvers.","Mortal remains of wing commander namansh syal reach his native village in kangra.

"Amid Bihar introspection calls, Congress focuses on 'vote chori'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-bihar-introspection-calls-congress-focuses-on-vote-chori/articleshow/125525689.cms,"While Rahul called SIR a conspiracy and said democracy was being sacrificed to protect power, Kharge said the ‘hasty’ exercise was reminiscent of unplanned demonetisation and lockdown



NEW DELHI: After the decimation in Bihar, Congress has upped the ante on ""vote chori"" as the issue of focus, with the brass collectively slamming SIR on Sunday as an ""attempt to manipulate"" voters' lists, and packing the party schedule with protests. This has put in shade the demonstrations by Congress members in Patna who are accusing election managers of bungling ticket distribution, and the general dissenting voices seeking ""introspection"" on the defeat.On Sunday, Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi slammed the ""hasty"" special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in the wake of growing cases of deaths of BLOs.Rahul said, ""Chaos has been wrought upon the country in the name of SIR. Sixteen BLOs have lost their lives in three weeks. Heart attacks, stress, suicide - SIR is not a reform, it is an imposed oppression."" He said citizens were having to find their names in 22-year-old voter lists running into thousands of pages, and this was aimed at tiring out genuine voters into giving up so that ""vote chori"" continued unabated. ""This is not a failure, it is a conspiracy; democracy is being sacrificed to protect power,"" Rahul said.Kharge said the ""hasty SIR"" was reminiscent of unplanned ""demonetisation"" and ""lockdown"".Congress on Sunday directed its state units to observe upcoming ""samvidhan divas"" on Nov 26 as ""samvidhan bachao divas"" over SIR. Congress has already announced a mass rally in the capital on Dec 14 to mark the culmination of its nationwide ""signature campaign"" against ""vote chori"".Amid the unifocal agenda, the party has not moved to look at the Bihar election management after the massive defeat, an issue that is riling many within. Facing criticism are AICC in-charge Krishna Allavaru and the state brass but also the main strategists. It is felt that concern over SIR can go along with a serious relook at how the party contests elections, which could pave the way for a rethink that helps Congress in the future.The fact that Congress lost at least four elections that it was expected to win in the last couple of years has caused unrest among many who were hoping for ""honest analysis"" in the wake of the performance in Bihar. ""How will we improve if we don't look at our mistakes,"" said a neta, who stated that airing dissenting opinions was not going to matter anymore.The review meeting held by the top brass the day after the Bihar results blamed ""electoral irregularities"" for the disastrous outcome - viewed as the reason why not many dissenting voices have come out barring those given in the immediate wake of the defeat. ""We don't think anyone at the AICC even took note of those demonstrations in Patna,"" a key party manager said.","Congress has upped the ante on ""vote chori"" as the issue of focus.

"Madani cites Al-Falah, says govt working against Muslims",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/madani-cites-al-falah-says-govt-working-against-muslims/articleshow/125525667.cms,"While Zohran Mamdani and Sadiq Khan had become mayors of New York and London, Muslims in India could not even become VCs of universities, claimed Madani (in pic), adding that even if someone progressed he would be put in jail, like Azam Khan



NEW DELHI: Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind (JUH) president Maulana Arshad Madani's remarks alleging discrimination against Muslims while citing the example of Al-Falah University, which is under the scanner in the Delhi blast probe, have triggered a storm. Accusing the govt of working relentlessly to ensure that Muslims don't progress, Madani claimed that while Zohran Mamdani and Sadiq Khan could become the mayors of New York and London, respectively, Muslims in India cannot even become vice chancellors of universities.""And even if someone does, they will be sent to jail, like Azam Khan. Look at what is happening today with Al-Falah. He (the founder) is in jail, and how many years he will spend in jail, no one knows,"" Madani, chief of one of the two JUH factions, said, speaking at a session at Jamiat headquarters in Delhi Saturday.The founder of Al-Falah University, Jawed Siddiqui, is in custody of the Enforcement Directorate. Besides the current probe, it is alleged that Siddiqui was held in Delhi in an earlier case following a complaint of cheating and spent over two years in Tihar jail. He came out on bail in Feb 2004 and was later acquitted in the case by court the next year, after he and his brother agreed to make repayments.Madani said, ""The govt, since the time India got freedom, has been working on preventing Muslims from raising their heads.It is the result of this that today you hear people saying that there is a lack of leadership among Muslims."" Citing a Hindi idiom, he said the govt wants the Muslims ""to feel the ground slipping under their feet"", and ""it is happening...""BJP netas hit back on Sunday over Madani's remarks. Party spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla told PTI, ""In the name of vote bank, the 'bhaijann of appeasement' and the 'aatanki bachao jamaat (save terrorists group)' has become active."" He added, ""Arshad Madani ji, leave aside this talk of mayor; this country has seen Muslims becoming president, vice president, chief justice, home minister. The biggest artists and businessmen have also come from the Muslim community. "" BJP member Shahnawaz Hussain slammed Madani's statement as ""very irresponsible"".However, some Congress netas saw merit in Madani's remarks. Former MP Sandeep Dikshit said, ""This govt has launched a very systematic campaign against a particular religion."" At the same time, he made it clear that Madani's linking the issue to Al-Falah is not right. ""I hope that in the case of Al-Falah doctors, the NIA will conduct an impartial probe,"" he said.Congress' Rashid Alvi said, ""Take strict action against those who are responsible, who are terrorists, spreading terror, breaking the law, whoever they may be. But that doesn't mean you destroy the entire university,"" he said.","Jamiat ulama-i-hind (juh) president maulana arshad madani's remarks alleging discrimination against muslims have triggered a storm.

'Creamy layer' cornering big share of jobs quota: CJI Gavai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/creamy-layer-cornering-big-share-of-jobs-quota-cji-gavai/articleshow/125525604.cms,"CJI Gavai (File photo)



NEW DELHI: On his last day in office, CJI Bhushan Ramakrishna Gavai, the second from Dalit community to head the judiciary, said it is worrisome that caste is being weaponised by the socially and economically uplifted among SC/ST communities to corner a major portion of reservation in jobs.CJI Gavai also expressed concern over the spiraling social tendency to indulge in hate speech and said it is for Parliament to debate and, if needed, legislate new norms and mechanisms to curb the phenomenon. Reasonable restrictions on free speech under the Constitution appear inadequate to deal with rampant hate speech on social media. ""Personally, I think that some sort of regulatory mechanism needs to be put in place,"" the CJI remarked.Speaking to TOI, CJI Gavai said it is high time that Centre and the states sub-categorised SC/ST communities to enable those who continue to be socially, economically and educationally backward among these communities to reap the benefits of quota in govt jobs.As regards the verdict of a seven-judge bench headed by him that had permitted states to sub-categorise castes within SC communities based on socio-economic backwardness and the degree of under-representation in govt jobs, ensuring that the larger pie of quota in jobs went to the most backward, the CJI said that despite criticism from his own community, he strongly feels that the 'creamy layer' among SC/ST communities must give way to the deprived among these communities.Asked about the best and worst moments in his tenure as CJI, he said that while the judgment against bulldozer justice was the most satisfying one he had delivered, the way Justice Ujjal Bhuyan criticised his majority view in a recent verdict that overturned the earlier SC verdict on Bills passed by Assemblies marked a low for him. ""He could have criticised my decision. But he was personal in his criticism. That left a bad taste,"" the CJI said.Asked about the meagre representation of women in Supreme Court , the CJI said this is mainly on account of very few women judges at present finding a place among those in the zone of consideration. ""This is because the selection of women judges for HCs picked up late, and I'm sure that in another five years, there will be many women HC judges in the zone of consideration for elevation to the apex court.""Given the option to choose between the Collegium system and one akin to the quashed National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) which was put in place unanimously by Parliament, the CJI said the present system (Collegium) has worked well, especially since the Collegium started interacting with the recommended persons individually to test their suitability.On the pendency of more than five crore cases in trial courts, he said the strength of trial court judges (around 21,000 at present) needs to be increased in a phased yet continuous manner.Among the important judgments penned by him, the series of rulings that strengthened the protection of environment, ecology and forests are closest to his heart. The unanimous verdict in the Presidential Reference, the one for sub-categorisation of SC/STs and the striking down of Tribunal Reforms Act, all of which required long hours of deliberation, too figured among the favourite judgments of CJI Gavai.",Cji bhushan ramakrishna gavai is the second from dalit community to head the judiciary.

E-tailers fined for selling walkie talkies

NEW DELHI: The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has imposed a Rs 30,000 fine on a restaurant in Patna for collecting service charge from a customer in violation of guidelines. The authority's order - monetary penalty, direction to refund service charge collected and instructions to immediately stop the practice - may serve as a reference point for similar consumer complaints in the future.This comes after the March 28 Delhi HC order which held that all restaurants must adhere to guidelines issued by CCPA on service charge. The court also made it clear that any violation of guidelines would invite appropriate action against erring establishments.CCPA in its guidelines issued on July 4, 2022, had specified that no hotel or restaurant will add service charge automatically or by default to the bill and that this should not be collected by adding it along with the food bill and GST on the total amount. Service charge is voluntary and this must be informed to customers.The instant case was taken up CCPA after Ravi Nandan Kumar filed a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline in April over Cafe Blue Bottle levying a service charge of Rs 801 in addition to GST.CCPA carried out an examination of the veracity of the claim since such a practice would have impacted a 'class' of customers.In response, the restaurant claimed that service charge was optional and that if a customer declines to pay, it is removed from the bill. It also submitted that a refund of Rs 591 would be made to the customer.An investigation found the restaurant had offered a credit note of Rs 591 (minus discount of Rs 210), without the customer's consent, which was ""not a valid substitute for monetary reimbursement"". The authority concluded that the restaurant used a software based bill generation system whereby service charge would have been automatically generated for all customers. It noted the restaurant didn't submit the number of bills with included service charge but removed or refunded subsequently to clear shadows of doubts.In two other orders, CCPA imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh each on Jiomart and Chimiya for selling walkie talkies without necessary disclosures. They have also been directed to remove advertisements and ensure that in future no product requiring statutory approval or certification is listed or sold on platforms without compliance of law.","The central consumer protection authority (ccpa) has imposed a rs 30,000 fine on a restaurant in patna for collecting service charge from a customer.
