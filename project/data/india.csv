FIR against Kamra



Opposition support



NEW DELHI: Comedian Kunal Kamra on Sunday sparked controversy after he took a jibe at Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde during a show in Mumbai.The incident drew a sharp response from Shiv Sena (Shinde faction) workers who went on to vandalise the venue where Kamra performed.During his stand-up show, Kamra performed a parody of a popular Hindi song from ""Dil To Pagal Hai,"" referring to Shinde as a ""gaddar"" (traitor). He also made jokes about recent political developments in Maharashtra, including party splits within Shiv Sena and NCP.“Meri nazar se tum dekho to gaddar nazar wo aaye. Haaye,"" Kunal Kamra said during his show.""Shiv Sena first came out of the BJP, then Shiv Sena came out of Shiv Sena. NCP came out of NCP, they gave nine buttons to one voter... everyone got confused,"" he added.According to police officials, Shiv Sena workers vandalized Hotel Unicontinental in Mumbai’s Khar area, where Kamra's show with the 'gaddar' (traitor) jibe at Eknath Shinde was filmed. They also sought an FIR against him.AN FIR was registered against Shiv Sena Yuva Sena general secretary Rahool Kanal and 19 others for vandalising the Habitat standup comedy set under various sections of BNS and Maharashtra Police Act.Shiv Sena MLA Murji Patel filed an FIR against Kamra and issued an ultimatum, demanding an apology within two days. Patel threatened to restrict Kamra's movement in Mumbai and promised to raise the issue in the assembly.""We have filed an FIR against Kunal Kamra for his comments against our leader and Maharashtra's DCM Eknath Shinde. We have demanded quick action against him. I want to tell him to apologize to Eknath Shinde within two days, otherwise, Shiv Sainiks will not let him move about freely in Mumbai,"" Patel said.""If he is seen anywhere in public, we will paint his face black... We will take up this issue in the assembly and request our state's home minister to order action against him as soon as possible,"" he added.Party leaders dismissed Kamra as a ""hired comedian"" making comments for money.""Kunal Kamra is a hired comedian, and he is making comments on our leader for some money. Let alone Maharashtra, Kunal Kamra cannot freely go anywhere in India; Shiv Sainiks will show him his place. We feel sorry for Sanjay Raut and Shiv Sena (UBT) that they have no party workers or leaders left to make comments on our leader, which is why they are hiring people like him (Kunal Kamra) for the job,"" Mhaske said.The opposition, particularly Shiv Sena (UBT), defended Kamra and condemned the attack. Aaditya Thackeray called the vandalism an act of cowardice by ""Mindhe's gang"" and questioned the state's law and order situation.""Mindhe's (read Shinde) coward gang breaks the comedy show stage where comedian Kunal Kamra put out a song on Eknath Mindhe, which was 100 percent true. Only an insecure coward would react to a song by someone,"" Shiv Sena-UBT leader and MLA Aaditya Thackeray said.Sena MP Sanjay Raut shared Kamra's video, praising it as ""Kunal Ka Kamal,"" while Priyanka Chaturvedi criticised the justification of violence over disagreement.","Comedian kunal kamra sparked controversy after he took a jibe at maharashtra deputy chief minister eknath shinde.

The action loomed even as curfew was lifted Sunday from all areas scarred by the March 17 violence.The action by Nagpur Municipal Corporation against Khan's double-storied house in Sanjay Bagh Colony will be the first such razing of a riot accused's property by the civic body. It will unfold two days after CM Devendra Fadnavis asserted that ""bulldozers will run, if the law permits"". He was responding to a query on whether his BJP-led Mahayuti govt would follow UP CM Yogi Adityanath's model of delivering justice.The demolition will unfold months after the Supreme Court imposed a pan-India ban on "" bulldozer justice "".The SC last Nov had held that such demolition of a citizen's house without following due process of law, merely because the individual is a suspect or even a convict, will be ""totally unconstitutional"". The court laid down elaborate procedures for razing illegal structures and ruled that the state could not breach a family's right to shelter only because one of its members is accused of a heinous crime.The demolition of Khan's house is expected to begin around 10am on Monday with heavy police deployments. NMC had issued notice to Khan on March 21 saying the 86.48sqm house, registered in the name of his wife Zahirunnisa, was illegal.NMC officials inspected the house on March 20 and said it violated Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966. The officials said no building plan was approved, making the structure unauthorised. Despite complaints from residents about the encroachment, civic authorities had not acted so far. TOI has a copy of the demolition notice.On Saturday, Nagpur police had sealed two shops after a probe found these were used by rioters linked to Khan's Minority Democratic Party (MDP).Meanwhile, curfew was lifted Sunday from riot-affected areas after a nearly week-long turbulence, a day after CM Fadnavis asserted that 80% of the city was unaffected by the March 17 flare-up. While the curbs were done away, security measures were retained in some sensitive pockets. The death of Irfan Ansari, a 38-year-old riot victim, in hospital on Saturday stoked security concerns. The curfew relief has coincided with festive mood setting in with Gudi Padwa and Eid later this month, followed by Ram Navami and Hanuman Jayanti in April.",Fahim khan's double-storied house in sanjay bagh colony will be razed.

Shiv Sena workers vandalize comedy venue

Political leaders' reactions

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena MP Naresh Mhaske on Sunday issued a stern warning to stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra after he took a jibe at Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde during a Mumbai comedy show .Subsequently, Shiv Sena members damaged the Habitat Comedy Club in Khar where the performance took place.During his performance at the Habitat Comedy Club in Mumbai, Kamra addressed the political division in Maharashtra. A viral video on X showed Kamra's subtle dig at Shinde's rebellion against Uddhav Thackeray and the ensuing political developments.""Shiv Sena first came out of the BJP, then Shiv Sena came out of Shiv Sena. NCP came out of NCP, they gave nine buttons to one voter...everyone got confused,"" Kamra said.Kamra also sang a parody song with reference to Thane—Shinde's political bastion—labeling him a ""gaddar"" (traitor) without naming him.The video, uploaded by Kamra, went viral in no time, garnering over 360,000 views.Sena MP Naresh Mhaske from the Shinde group accused Kamra of being a paid performer hired by Uddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena (UBT) to criticise Eknath Shinde.""Kunal Kamra is a hired comedian, and he is making comments on our leader for some money. Let alone Maharashtra, Kunal Kamra cannot freely go anywhere in India, Shiv Sainiks will show him his place. We feel sorry for Sanjay Raut and Shiv Sena (UBT) that they have no party workers or leaders left to make comments on our leader, which is why they are hiring people like him (Kunal Kamra) for the job"", Naresh Mhaske told ANI on Sunday.""We follow the ideology of Balasaheb Thackeray, and we will make sure Kunal Kamra is not free to move around- neither in Maharashtra nor in the country. Kunal Kamra will get a befitting reply, and he will come and apologise for his mistake"", he added.Hours after the video came up, Shiv Sena (Shinde faction) workers vandalized the Habitat Comedy Club in Khar, where Kamra's show was recorded. Reports suggest that the workers smashed property and warned of further action if Kamra continued his criticism.Local police verified the incident and are probing the vandalism, but no formal complaints have been registered by the comedy club as yet.Sanjay Raut, Shiv Sena UBT MP, publicly backed Kamra by sharing the comedian’s video and wrote, ""Kunal ki kamal, Jai Maharashtra,"" on X.Priyanka Chaturvedi, Shiv Sena UBT MP, also supported Kamra, referencing Voltaire in her defense of free speech. ""Dear Kunal, stand strong. The man and the gang you exposed will go after you... I will defend to death your right to speak your mind,"" she posted on X.Shiv Sena, Shinde faction, also responded. Mhaske doubled down on his position, saying that Kamra would receive a ""befitting reply"" and would eventually apologize for his remarks.

CPM trolled as red display picture of party's Bengal unit turns blue on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cpm-trolled-as-red-display-picture-of-partys-bengal-unit-turns-blue-on-social-media/articleshow/119398229.cms,"'It was just a change in the look of the logo': CPM scrambles to downplay controversy

KOLKATA: CPM is no stranger to political storms. But this time, it's a tempest of trolls. A change in the social media display picture of the party's Bengal unit - swapping the iconic red background for a blue sky and white clouds - has set off a social media frenzy, with netizens seeing shades of irony, humour, and even surrender in the move. For the once-dominant force in Bengal politics , the change is as striking as it is symbolic. The new backdrop - uncannily close to the favourite colours of CM Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress - has led to a digital avalanche of jibes, memes and one-liners.Firbe na aar se firbe na (It will not return), posted netizen Soumik Das, borrowing lyrics from a popular Bengali rock song. The message was clear: CPM, which governed Bengal from 1977 to 2011, is struggling to claw back into relevance.CPM's social media reach is still formidable. Its Instagram handle ""cpimwb"" has over 81,300 followers, while its Facebook page boasts 467,000. But the response to the new display picture has been more about ridicule than resonance - 1,100 comments, 448 shares, and a flood of snarky remarks. The party's electoral fortunes have been equally stark. Once a behemoth in Bengal, it won 26 assembly seats in 2016, clinging to 19.7% of the vote share. But by 2024, CPM had slumped to just 5.7% in Lok Sabha polls.Sensing the growing chatter, party members scrambled to downplay the controversy. ""It was just a change in the look of the logo,"" said CPM central committee member Sujan Chakraborty. ""We've changed it eight times in recent years. Our flag remains a vibrant hue of red. We are not wavering from our commitments to end exploitation.""CPM state panel member Satarup Ghosh was more blunt: ""We don't think the sky, or its allusion, is patented by Trinamool."" In fact, the change had served its purpose, he said. ""You don't see anything other than the hammer and sickle on Facebook now.""For a party whose identity has long been tied to its blood-red banner, the absence of even a speck of red in the new display picture is striking. The red flag, a symbol of socialist struggle since the French Revolution, was proudly adopted by CPM - its hammer and sickle etched in the imagination of leftist politics.But blogger Anirban Hati saw a deeper irony. He recalled how former Kerala CMs EK Nayanar and EMS Namboodiripad slammed author Arundhati Roy decades ago for describing a faded red flag in 'The God of Small Things'. ""Decades later, the Left has no hard-line left,"" Hati wrote, noting how Roy's metaphor now seems uncannily prescient.Netizen Sandip Ghosh had a more gastronomic take on the matter: ""The background fits Didi's favourite colour. Fish fry and mutton kasa will be on the menu again.""Whether the red will return - or continue fading into the blue - remains an open question. But for now, the trolls are having a field day.","A change in the social media display picture of the party's bengal unit has set off a social media frenzy.

Examination of judge's CDR will need expert help

NEW DELHI: CJI Sanjiv Khanna 's prompt move to order a judicial inquiry into charges of cash being found at Justice Yashwant Varma 's residence notwithstanding, the task ahead for the three-member panel could be tedious and time-consuming as it involves examining many people and requires assistance of experts to analyse the judge's call data records .The panel of Punjab & Haryana CJ Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Anu Sivaraman, all seasoned judges with over a decade's experience in constitutional courts, will have to take out time to list people to be examined.In the list will be the first responders to the fire in the storeroom of Justice Varma's residence on March 14 night, which the police chief claimed mostly remained locked but the judge said was accessed by staff, gardeners and PWD staff.The panel will take the help of forensic experts to verify the authenticity of the video of burnt cash shot by the first responders and also examine whether the place where cash was burnt matched with the storeroom at the judge's residence.Since Justice Varma cited the Delhi fire chief 's ""no cash found at the judge's residence"" statement in his defence, the latter may also be summoned and asked about the basis for his statement and subsequent U-turn.Security personnel who said ""debris and half-burnt"" articles were removed by the judge's staff on March 15 - a charge denied by Justice Varma - will also be examined along with their colleagues who were on security duty at the bungalow on Tughlaq Crescent for the last six months. Staff who worked at Justice Varma's residence, including his personal assistants, will be called as well.Another important aspect of the inquiry is the examination of call data records of the phones used by Justice Varma in his official and personal capacity. The inquiry panel will require assistance of experts in information technology and telecom industries for this. The judge has been asked not to delete any data from his phones.The Delhi Police commissioner had informed Delhi HC CJ D K Upadhyay on March 15 that ""the storeroom is adjacent to the guard room where Central Reserve Police Force (Battalion 70F) is posted and the storeroom used to be kept locked"". However, the judge in his defence had said, ""The room was being used as a storeroom to keep useless household articles and remained accessible to all and sundry and was not kept locked.""However, the Delhi HC CJ's report said, ""The enquiry conducted by me, prima facie, does not reveal possibility of entry or access to the room by any person other than those residing in the bungalow, the servants, the gardeners and CPWD personnel, if any. Accordingly, I am of the prima facie opinion that the entire matter warrants a deeper probe.""In his explanation, Justice Varma had said, ""I once again make it clear that no one from my house ever reported seeing any currency in burnt form in the room. In fact, this gets further corroborated from there being no cash or currency which we saw when the site was restored to us after the fire personnel and police had left the scene, quite apart from we being not apprised of any recovery or seizure made on the spot. This may also be viewed in light of the statement of the chief of the fire service which I have gathered from news reports.""",Three-member panel will have to take out time to list people to be examined.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Four-and-a half years after it began probing the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput , the CBI is learned to have closed the case and given a clean chit to actor Rhea Chakraborty , bringing curtains on a case that had gripped the country, reports Rajshekhar Jha. Rajput was found dead at his Bandra flat on June 14, 2020.The probe agency is learned to have filed a closure report in two of the cases it was investigating, sources said. While one case was filed in Aug 2021 in Patna by Rajput's father against Rhea, her kin and others, the other was filed in Sept by Rhea against Rajput's sister and doctor.The closure report in both was filed in a special Mumbai court, sources said.Rhea's lawyer Satish Maneshinde said, ""Rhea Chakraborty had to undergo untold miseries and was behind bars for 27 days for no fault of hers until Justice Sarang V Kotwal released her on bail. I salute her and her family for having kept silent and yet suffered the inhuman treatment they were meted out. Innocent people were hounded and paraded before the media and investigative authorities. I hope this does not repeat in any case.""Rajput was found dead 6 days after his PR manager Disha Salian fell off the 14th floor of a Malad tower and died.Rajput was found dead at his Bandra apartment on June 14, 2020, six days after his PR manager Disha Salian died. Mumbai police , which first probed the case, termed it as a case of suspected suicide, although no suicide note had been found. The provisional post-mortem suggested the cause of death was asphyxia due to hanging.Coincidentally, on Wednesday, Disha's father Satish Salian alleged his daughter was gangraped and murdered. He has filed a plea demanding a CBI probe into her death, alleging that Rajput was visibly frightened and repeatedly expressed fear that ""those people"" responsible for her death would not spare him and that he would be killed. He has said both deaths are interconnected and part of a larger conspiracy.The CBI FIR in Rajput's case named Rhea and her kin Indrajit Chakraborty, Sandhya and Showik apart from her associates Samuel Miranda and Shruti Modi.The FIR, initially filed by Bihar police , had sections of IPC related to criminal conspiracy, abetment of suicide, wrongful restraint, wrongful confinement, theft, criminal breach of trust, cheating and criminal intimidation.After Rajput's cremation at Vile Parle's Pawan Hans crematorium, Mumbai police began their investigation, recording statements from film and casting director Mukesh Chhabra, Rajput's girlfriend Rhea, and his managerial staff. In July that year, producer Sanjay Leela Bhansali was questioned, stating he had offered Rajput four films, but eventually featured in none.Rhea, who confirmed being in a relationship with Rajput on Twitter (now X), demanded a CBI inquiry. Mumbai police also recorded statements of filmmaker Aditya Chopra and three psychiatrists.Meanwhile, an FIR was registered against Rhea in Patna on July 28, and a team of Bihar police reached Mumbai to probe the case.The Enforcement Directorate inquired about the money laundering angle in the case and questioned Rhea but they found no substance against her. Subsequently, the NCB initiated a probe against her along with others on allegations of procurement of drugs for Rajput which led to her arrest. In Aug 2021, the CBI filed an FIR against Rhea and others, and the ED too summoned her for questioning.An AIIMS forensic team was roped in by the CBI on Aug 22, and the ED unearthed a drug angle in the case, involving the Narcotics Control Bureau .In Sept 2021, Rhea filed an FIR against Rajput's sisters and doctor, which was transferred to the CBI as well.This is the second case which has been closed as well, sources said.In Oct, reports emerged that the AIIMS panel had dismissed the murder theory, although the CBI stated they were probing all angles.","Cbi closes actor sushant singh rajput death case, clears rhea chakraborty.

From 2020 to date, Centre has provided Rs 20,660 crore for road development of Ladakh,” Malhotra told journalists in Leh.The minister showcased progress on Bilaspur-Manali-Leh railway project with an Rs 1.31-lakh crore allocation. “At present, the journey from Delhi to Leh takes 40 hours (by road) but after the railway line is ready, it will reduce the distance to 20 hours,” Malhotra said.

NEW DELHI: A CCTV video from the office of controversial preacher Bajinder Singh has surfaced online, showing him physically assaulting multiple individuals, including a woman with a child.The footage was reportedly recorded in February 2025 and has triggered massive outrage, with critics calling for strict action against the self-styled Christian prophet .In the viral video, Singh is first seen throwing a mobile phone at an employee before approaching and slapping him. Moments later, he is seen attacking a woman who had come to his office with her child.As seen in the footage, he first threw a pile of papers at her before pushing her during an altercation. The incident quickly escalated into a heated argument, with others in the office intervening to separate them.The footage comes at a time when Bajinder Singh is already under investigation in a sexual harassment case.As per PTI, a 22-year-old woman accused the pastor of harassment, stating that he took her mobile number and began sending her messages.From 2022, Singh allegedly made her sit alone in a church cabin, where he hugged her and touched her inappropriately. She further claimed that he threatened to have her and her family eliminated if she reported him. The Punjab Police registered a case against Singh on February 28, booking him under Sections 354A (sexual harassment), 354D (stalking), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.Following the complaint, a three-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed, led by Superintendent of Police Rupinder Kaur, to probe the allegations. The National Commission for Women (NCW) has also taken cognizance of the matter and demanded swift action against Singh.Singh, however, has dismissed the allegations, calling them ""baseless.""Speaking to the media earlier, he said, ""Fake chats can be easily created these days. They should provide proof against me. Everyone in the church knows that she [the complainant] suffered from fits and was troubled by evil spirits. People come here for prayers, and our job is to pray. She is like our daughter"".Singh has a history of controversy. In 2018, he was arrested at Delhi airport over a sexual harassment case filed by a woman from Zirakpur. More recently, a Mohali court issued warrants against him in that case. In 2022, he was accused of taking money from a Delhi-based family for treating their daughter, who later died.The preacher has also been on the radar of tax authorities, with income tax raids conducted at his premises in 2023.Despite these allegations, Singh remains a well-known figure with a massive social media following. His YouTube channel, ""Prophet Bajinder Singh,"" has over 3.74 million subscribers, and his sermons often attract large crowds, both in India and abroad.Celebrities such as actors Chunky Pandey and Aditya Pancholi have previously endorsed him.","Cctv video shows self-styled christian prophet bajinder singh assaulting multiple individuals.

Speaking at AAP's 'Ek Shaam Shaheedon Ke Naam' event on Sunday, Kejriwal accused both the BJP and Congress of colluding, alleging that neither party values the contributions of national icons Bhagat Singh and BR Ambedkar .""We consider Bhagat Singh and Baba Saheb Ambedkar our ideals. There are pictures of both of them in our house and in every office of the Delhi and Punjab governments. The first thing the new government in Delhi did was to remove the pictures of both. We were waiting for them (BJP) to announce Rs 2,500 to women. But they removed the pictures of Bhagat Singh and Baba Saheb and put up pictures of their leaders first,"" Kejriwal said.He added, ""When we put up the pictures of these two, Congress protested that Gandhiji's picture was not put up. However, when the BJP removed the photos of these two, Congress did not say anything. There is a collusion between these two.""Kejriwal recalled how Bhagat Singh’s letters from jail were delivered to his comrades despite being critical of the British. In contrast, he alleged that his own letter from prison never reached the Lieutenant Governor and instead led to a show cause notice against him. ""Bhagat Singh had the freedom to write any letter, but I was not even allowed to write two lines,"" he said, calling the BJP ""worse than the British.""""I wrote a letter to LG that I was in jail, so Atishi should be allowed to hoist the flag. There was nothing wrong with this. I gave a letter to the jail superintendent, but the letter did not reach LG, and I got a show cause notice that how dare I write such a letter. Bhagat Singh had the freedom to write any letter, but I could not write a letter of two lines. You (BJP) are worse than the British,"" he said.AAP suffered a major electoral setback in Delhi, losing to the BJP, which secured 48 of the 70 seats. Kejriwal’s return to public life at the Shaheed Diwas event marks a significant moment for the party as it attempts to regain momentum. The event, held at the AAP headquarters, was attended by senior leaders, MLAs, councillors, and office-bearers.Kejriwal’s comments also reflect the deepening rift between AAP and Congress, who were allies in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections but turned into fierce rivals during the Delhi assembly polls. The campaign saw Rahul Gandhi launching scathing attacks against Kejriwal, accusing him of corruption and misgovernance. The Congress had alleged that AAP was responsible for the liquor scam and criticised Kejriwal for failing to maintain the legacy of previous Congress-led governments in Delhi.Also read: Have allies-turned-rivals dealt a deadly blow to opposition's INDIA bloc? The animosity between AAP and Congress had intensified in the run-up to the elections, with Kejriwal frequently hitting back at Gandhi’s allegations. ""Modi puts people in jail even by making fake cases like the liquor scam. Why haven't you and your family been arrested in open-and-shut cases like National Herald? How did Robert Vadra get a clean chit from BJP? It is better if you don't preach on fear and bravery,"" Kejriwal had said in response to Gandhi’s criticisms.

NEW DELHI: Shahi Jama Masjid committee president Zafar Ali was arrested on Sunday in connection with the violence that erupted in Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal on November 24 last year over a court-ordered survey of the mosque.Sambhal Superintendent of Police Krishan Kumar Bishnoi confirmed that Ali had been arrested.“We had gathered evidence that he played an incendiary role during the violence last year. He was picked up by the police from his house in Sambhal Sunday morning and was interrogated at Kotwali police station by senior cops before being finally arrested,” said Kumar.""Ali has been arrested after questioning him ...

We are trying to restore peace, but all police officers and senior officials here are provoking further discord,"" he claimed.Earlier in the day, the Special Investigation Team of Sambhal police had taken Ali into custody to record his statement.The Mughal-era mosque has been at the center of a significant controversy following claims that it was built on the site of an ancient Hindu temple. The violence during protests against a court-ordered survey of the mosque resulted in four fatalities and numerous injuries, including among police personnel.The November 24 incident led to widespread unrest, with protestors clashing with police, throwing stones, and setting vehicles ablaze. The police responded with tear gas to disperse the crowd. In total, the SIT has filed a chargesheet exceeding 4,000 pages across six of the twelve cases related to this violence, naming 159 individuals as accused.The chargesheet also revealed that weapons recovered from the scene were manufactured in countries including the United Kingdom and Germany.Reports indicate that Ali was among the first to receive information about the survey, which sparked protests that escalated into violence as locals gathered outside the mosque.Since the initial outbreak of violence, Sambhal has remained relatively calm, with no further incidents reported. In anticipation of upcoming celebrations, including Holi, local authorities have maintained a heavy police presence and conducted flag marches to ensure public safety.During this period, residents celebrated Holi peacefully alongside Friday prayers at the mosque.Circle Officer Anuj Chowdhary had led a flag march along with other police personnel to ensure the law and order situation in the district before Holi.

Who was Rana Sanga?



NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday defended his party leader's "" Rana Sanga a traitor"" remark, saying that referring to a page in ""history should not be an issue"".A massive controversy erupted after SP Rajya Sabha MP Ramjilal Suman on March 21 called Rajput warrior Rana Sanga a ""traitor"" and Hindus his descendent.Attacking the rival BJP, Suman argued that ""if Muslims are called the descendants of Babur, then Hindus must be the descendants of traitor Rana Sanga"".During his speech in Parliament, Suman had said, ""Indian Muslims do not consider Babur as their idol. They follow Prophet Muhammad and the Sufi tradition. But I want to ask, who brought Babur here? It was Rana Sanga who invited Babur to defeat Ibrahim Lodi.""So, if Muslims are called the descendants of Babur, then Hindus must be the descendants of traitor Rana Sanga. We criticise Babur, but why don't we criticise Rana Sanga?""As the BJP continued to mount an attack on the Samajwadi leader, Akhilesh Yadav came out in Suman's defence, saying: ""Everyone is flipping through the pages of history. Ask BJP leaders which pages they are turning. What are they debating? They want to talk about Aurangzeb.""""If Ramjilal Suman ji has referred to a page in history that contains certain facts, then what's the issue? We didn't write history 200 years ago,"" the SP chief said, according to news agency PTI.""If BJP continues to flip through history, people will also remember that during Chhatrapati Shivaji 's coronation, no one anointed him by hand. It is said that he was anointed using the toe of a left foot. Will the BJP condemn this today?"" he said.He further added: ""Galileo was punished for his scientific assertion, and centuries later, the Church apologised for its mistake. If the BJP respects Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, will they apologise for the fact that he was anointed with a left foot toe?""Hitting back, BJP leader Amit Malviya said Yadav, ""who indulges in appeasement, is supporting his MP Ramji Lal for calling the great warrior Rana Sanga a traitor. This is an insult not only to the Rajput community but to the entire Hindu community"".""The distorted comments being made on the Maha Kumbh were also no exception but are an indication of the petty anti-Hindu mentality of the SP, due to which the people of Uttar Pradesh have pushed the SP to the lowest rung of the state's politics,"" he said.Rana Sanga (1472–1528), also known as Maharana Sangram Singh, was the Rajput ruler of Mewar and a prominent warrior king of medieval India. He united various Rajput clans to resist foreign invasions and expanded his kingdom significantly. Known for his bravery, he fought multiple battles, including against the Delhi Sultanate and the Lodis.His most famous battle was against Babur in 1527 at Khanwa, where he led a massive Rajput alliance but was ultimately defeated due to Babur's superior tactics and artillery. Despite his loss, Rana Sanga remains a symbol of Rajput valour and resistance against foreign rule in India.","Samajwadi party (sp) chief akhilesh yadav defends his party leader's "" rana sanga a traitor"" remark.
