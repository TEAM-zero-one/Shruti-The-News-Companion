It was DLTGH 50 (days left to go home) at National Defence Academy (NDA). Morning announcements at squadrons were now beginning with this cheerful count. Mid-term had passed. Termbreak — and home — were only a few weeks away when the Oct 10 morning muster in Charlie Squadron reported a missing firsttermer, Cadet Antriksh Kumar Singh.The 18-year-old was found dead in his cabin. It was the third suicide in NDA since 2014. The Lucknow boy had cleared Services Selection Board (SSB) in his first attempt and was by all accounts a very bright student. What drove him beyond the edge?Less than two weeks later, tragedy struck again. This time in the swimming pool. Bravo Squadron first-termer Aditya D Yadav, a weak swimmer, was being put through extra lessons to clear his mandatory test when he drowned.Just how he died in the presence of six instructors, other cadets and officers is not known yet.Police investigations are on into both incidents. NDA is holding a court of inquiry. Both families have alleged a conspiracy and demanded ‘impartial investigations’.The back-to-back deaths at India’s premier military academy have triggered a deep introspection within defence and training circles about SSB, the training regimen and the psychological resilience expected of boys and girls fresh out of school.Selection for NDA is one of the most gruelling in the world — some 6 lakh sign up for just 406 seats. After clearing a UPSC written exam, candidates have to undergo an SSB interview process that lasts four days for those that clear screening. Then, there are medical tests. It’s after this multi-layered filtering that cadets earn the right to wear the Ashoka emblem on their NDA beret.Then comes training. Often, night merges into sleepless night after the day’s soul-sapping ‘ ragda ’ for first-termers. “Forget the drill square or PT grounds, merely surviving from reveille to lights-out in the squadron was a challenge in my ‘ Ikki ’ (first-termer) days,” recalled an NDA alumnus, who later joined as an instructor. “The process of forging boys into soldiers needs to be hard on mind and body. Unfortunately, sometimes tragedies happen. My heart goes out to the families of these cadets.”While the two deaths occurred under different circumstances, they are an indication of the immense adjustment pressures first-term cadets face.There have been nine deaths at NDA in the last two decades, three of them suicides. Cadets quitting training is also a major concern. A 2018 news report, quoting a report jointly prepared by Integrated Defence Staff Headquarters and NDA, revealed that between Jan 2008 and Nov 2017, as many as 1,256 cadets quit NDA, or a good 16-20% of intake every year.So, what’s going wrong?spoke to former SSB assessors, NDA instructors and former commandants and deputy commandants and a common voice emerged: the need to introduce systemic reforms that can ensure cadet safety without compromising on toughness.A consensus among several former SSB presidents and instructors is that the problem begins much before cadets even reach NDA. They point out that while the SSB process rigorously tests the mental makeup of a candidate, there is a need for a more uniform and scientific physical assessment system during the selection process itself.Candidates who fare poorly on the individual obstacle course may still get recommended if they are found fit otherwise — but the physical weakness shows up in NDA’s gruelling pace. Many candidates can’t cope with the sheer physical demands and drop out or get injured or worse.On Feb 11, 2022, defence minister Rajnath Singh informed Lok Sabha that 211 cadets had been discharged from NDA, IMA (Indian Military Academy in Dehradun) and OTA (Officers Training Academy, in Chennai and Gaya) in the previous 10 years as disabled and medically unfit for service.Experts suggest that like soldier recruitment rallies, a standardised physical test — based on measurable, uniform parameters — should be introduced for officer aspirants as well. Additionally, they recommend that cadets undergo comprehensive physical fitness assessments upon reporting to NDA.“Without a scientific baseline, how can the academy know if a cadet has weak leg muscles or poor endurance?” asked a retired physical training officer. “Instead of asking a new cadet to run a few kilometres within days of joining, the academy should build endurance gradually. Those who fail to meet standards after progressive training can then be screened out,” he suggested.“The individual obstacle test at SSB includes activities like ‘Tarzan jump’, vertical rope climbing or Burma bridge-crossing — things most civilian students have never done. Candidates from non-military schools find this difficult because it’s completely new to them,” said Brigadier Laxmicharan Patnaik, former president of an SSB centre.Brigadier Jay Konnur, former president of SSB Centre-Bangalore, acknowledged that physical standards often receive less attention during selection.“Candidates are asked to complete 10 obstacles in three minutes. We observe determination, not absolute physical capability. If a candidate manages even six, we tend to overlook the shortfall. That may not reflect the actual physical preparedness required for NDA training,” he said, adding that SSB’s focus on leadership and group dynamics often overshadows baseline fitness.“Once they reach NDA, every shortcoming becomes magnified in a far more demanding environment,” he pointed out.They are equally vocal about the need for improved and sustained psychological evaluations. “Psychological tests at SSBs are not foolproof,” said Patnaik, who was also chairman of Odisha Public Service Commission. “Repeated and deeper assessments at the academy are essential.”He feels NDA should appoint a dedicated team of psychologists to conduct regular evaluations and build a psychological dossier for each cadet.“These young men are future leaders of the armed forces. Understanding their emotional and mental resilience early can prevent breakdowns later,” Patnaik pointed out, adding that psychological counselling should be made a “normal and de-stigmatised part” of cadet life. “If we normalise counselling, first-termers will open up more. Confidential sessions can help them regain confidence and adjust to the demanding environment,” he said.“Cadets from civilian backgrounds face a stunning culture shock in the first term. They are not accustomed to the regimentation, physical demands or the sheer mental toughness that’s asked of them,” said an NDA alumnus. The academy has a system of counselling but what it needs is professional counsellors, said another alumnus.According to Major General Shukla, former commandant of SSB centre-Bhopal, the problem is compounded by interpersonal challenges within squadrons.“First-term cadets are often under immense pressure to prove themselves. Some seniors, driven by tradition or competition, unintentionally humiliate or overburden them. Sensitising senior cadets about mentorship is essential. They must handhold, not intimidate,” he said, remarking that effective mentorship and emotional support from senior cadets can ease this transition provided it is guided and monitored by officers. “Else, the same system that is meant to help may break them,” he cautioned.The “buddy system” — where every fresher is mentored by a senior cadet (overstudy) — has come under sharp scrutiny after recent incidents. Several parents, including serving officers, allege the system often crosses ethical and physical boundaries.“There are cases where seniors ask juniors to perform dangerous activities in the name of maintaining squadron honour,” said a source. “A second-term cadet suffered serious neck injuries when a senior asked him to perform a dive roll — a test the senior himself had not passed. The case is under consideration and the injured cadet is likely to board out on medical grounds.”Antriksh’s parents have alleged that his overstudy ragged him relentlessly. That is yet to be borne out in the police probe.The ‘fauji’ father of a medically boarded-out cadet said, “Each squadron competes fiercely in swimming, cross-country, or equestrian events. Seniors push juniors to unrealistic limits to maintain their reputation. This is neither scientific nor fair. This practice needs to be stopped.”However, former NDA commandants defend the mentorship tradition, insisting that when implemented correctly, it helps cadets adapt to a tough environment.Lt Gen Asit Mistry (retd), a former NDA commandant, said, “The buddy system has existed for decades and works effectively. Senior cadets help newcomers cope with the rigours of training. It’s unclear what went wrong in these cases, but the concept is sound.”Another former commandant added, “There is no scope for ragging or unscientific practices. Each squadron has officers specifically responsible for cadet welfare, who personally monitor stress and morale. Deviations must be dealt with seriously.”Ex-NDAs fiercely defend the academy’s ethos, and its emphasis on physical and mental toughness, pointing out that the system has produced three Param Vir Chakras, 12 Ashoka Chakras, 32 Mahavir Chakras and 160 Vir Chakras.But officers have also acknowledged the existence of what they term “unscientific traditions” — informal endurance practices not sanctioned but culturally ingrained. “These sessions are not officially part of the training schedule. But they are often conducted by senior cadets in the name of toughening them up. It can lead to injuries or psychological breakdowns,” said a former physical training officer.Another veteran observed that while the intention may be to foster toughness, such practices must be replaced with structured, scientific endurance programmes. “We must stop romanticising suffering as character-building. A soldier’s resilience should be built through method, not shock,” he suggested.Another alumnus recalled his own early struggles: “In my first term, I felt completely out of place. I couldn’t meet the standards and thought of quitting. It was only in the third term that I regained confidence. The system is harsh — but it shouldn’t break you before it builds you.”An officer who was part of the TriServices Committee, which tried to reform practices at training academies in 2003, said barracks punishments are the reasons for suicides and should be stopped immediately. “Most armies have changed it. Punishments can be military-ways, but harassment during night or odd hours should end immediately,” he toldon the condition of anonymity. “The academy must evolve with the times,” said Major General Shukla. “We cannot afford to lose bright young minds to outdated systems. The goal is not to dilute training, but to make it safer, smarter, and more humane.”As the investigations into the two deaths continue, the hope is that the tragedy will become a catalyst for long-overdue change — one that ensures no more dreams are extinguished in the process of building the nation’s defenders.Far from the institutional debate lies the anguish of devastated families. Rubikumari Yadav, mother of first-termer Aditya Yadav, said her life has been shattered. “My son dreamed of serving the nation, and now I am left with nothing. The academy says there was no fault. Who is responsible for my son’s death then?” she asked.Antriksh’s family says he faced intense pressure and humiliation from a senior cadet. “He topped his school and was full of dreams,” said his uncle, A P Sengar. “But he couldn’t bear the pressure. This is not training — it’s trauma.”Reacting to the allegations levelled by Antriksh’s parents, then NDA commandant Vice-Admiral Gurcharan Singh told, “It is a regrettable incident. He was a good cadet and performing well. We are in touch with the family and extending all possible assistance. A court of inquiry has been ordered to ascertain the facts.”But that’s little consolation for Rubikumari. “At the end of the day, I lost my son — and they lost one of the nation’s best,” she said.| Cadet Aditya D Yadav dies during swimming session| Cadet Antriksh Kumar Singh dies by suicide| Gentleman Cadet S Balu dies during a swimming session| Gentleman Cadet Kumbhar Atharv Sambhaji dies during cross country run| Gentleman Cadet Umang Khar dies from a heat stroke| Cadet R Rabijith dies during training| Cadets follow a clear hierarchy within each squadron, ensuring continuous guidance.

Threads of history

Struggles of continuity

In 1946, when Mahatma Gandhi set foot in Sualkuchi, a picturesque village nestled along the Brahmaputra near Guwahati, he was spellbound by the artistry of the local weavers, particularly the women. Their looms seemed to weave not just silk, but dreams, he felt. His words — “Assamese women weave dreams on their looms”, have lingered like the rustle of silk ever since.Nearly eight decades later, those looms are still humming. Sualkuchi remains one of the rare places in India where handlooms, not machines, dictate the rhythm of daily life.While many historic silk weaving centres across India have succumbed to the lure of power looms for economic gain, Sualkuchi, located 35km from Guwahati, remains a bastion of handloom tradition. This steadfast commitment to authenticity is a bequest of the village’s dedication to preserving its cultural heritage. Despite govt’s push for mechanisation in places like Varanasi and Kancheepuram, Sualkuchi’s weavers, supported by their community and loyal customers, have resisted, ensuring that the artistry of handwoven Muga and Pat silk remains untouched by the clatter of machines.This village, with approximately 50,000 people, produces three exquisite varieties of Assam silk — the golden Muga, the warm Eri, and the lustrous Pat — each derived from different silkworms.Within its 8 sq km, 12,000 handlooms work tirelessly, producing around 3 lakh sq m of silk fabric a year, valued at Rs 300 crore. But beyond the numbers lies something more fragile: a cultural identity woven into every strand of yarn. This cottage industry supports nearly 6,000 families, all intricately woven into the fabric of Sualkuchi’s identity.Dr Nihar Ranjan Kalita, an adviser to the Sualkuchi Tat Silpa Unnayan Samiti and principal of SBMS (Sualkuchi Budram Madhab Satradhikar) College, explains that the village’s handloom industry thrives because it is deeply embedded in the local culture. He says that the younger generation, drawn by the allure of fashion and style, actively participates in this age-old craft, ensuring its continuity. “There is societal pressure in Sualkuchi and Assam to keep the textile industry handloombased. The community understands the exquisite value of handloom products.”In Sualkuchi, wearing a mekhela chador (Assam’s traditional two-piece garment) made of Pat and Muga silk is a mark of prestige at weddings and festive gatherings. The village’s commitment to the handloom is so strong that the word “powerloom” is almost taboo, seen as a threat to the originality of their textiles.Kalita, who has explored various textile hubs across India, observes that while other centres focus on exports, Sualkuchi’s products are cherished domestically. This local focus, coupled with govt support for semimechanisation in allied activities, helps maintain the village’s handloom legacy.This guardianship of tradition is not without struggle. In 2013, when powerloom textiles and counterfeit fabrics began flooding the market, threatening to dilute Sualkuchi’s reputation, villagers rose in protest. Their agitation eventually led to the establishment of the Sualkuchi Silk Testing Laboratory. In 2017, its centuries-old weaving tradition earned trademark status. Now, entrepreneurs submit their products in the lab where every piece of silk is tested, certified, and tagged — with a QR code, a 3D hologram and the Silk Mark logo — if they meet the standards.With a quick scan, buyers today can verify a garment’s authenticity, trace its fabric details, and even discover the specific handloom and artisan behind the weave. The trademark seal, ‘Sualkuchi’s’, acts as both a brand and a shield, protecting these handcrafted treasures from counterfeiting.During’s visit to the lab, the staffers were seen conducting three tests to confirm authenticity — burning analysis, microscopic crosssectional examination and chemical verification. The first test involves burning small thread samples to verify silk content; microscopic analysis identifies the specific silk variety, while chemical testing is performed when the first two examinations prove inconclusive.Assam is unique in producing all four recognised silk varieties in India — Muga, Eri, Mulberry, and Tussar. But it is Muga that sets Sualkuchi apart. The distinctive golden yellow silk, exclusive to Assam, comes from the Antheraea assamensis silkworm. It’s valued for its longevity and distinctive lustre.Eri, recognised for its even texture, is used in clothing and household items. In the Mulberry category, despite substantial demand for the yarn, the supply of the locally available Nuni pat variety is insufficient. Weavers often source Mulberry and Tussar yarn, a recent addition to the state’s silk portfolio, from Karnataka (Mulberry), Jharkhand, Odisha, and West Bengal (Tussar).Sualkuchi’s history dates back to the 11th century, when King Dharma Pala of the Pala Dynasty established it as a weavers’ village by relocating 26 weaver families from Tantikuchi in Barpeta. Royal patronage turned the village into a hub of silk weaving. During the 17th century, under Ahom rule, it had become Assam’s primary handloom centre. For centuries, its economy thrived not just on weaving but also on pottery, goldsmithing, and oil pressing — until the 1940s, when only the looms endured.Until 1930, silk weaving was concentrated within Tantipara’s Tanti community. World War II gave Sualkuchi its biggest push, as skyrocketing demand and prices prompted several Tanti families to establish commercial weaving units with hired workers.However, challenges like rising raw material costs, market instability, and limited cocoon availability have pressed Sualkuchi’s weavers hard. “Muga silk products of Sualkuchi have been the most precious. But inadequate supply of cocoons and high prices of yarn have confined the number of households producing Muga textile to about 50,” says Kalyan Kalita, an entrepreneur. “Once, Sualkuchi was known for Muga above all else. Now, few families can afford to produce them. ” The industry has seen shifts: Bodo weavers, mostly women, have returned home after peace talks, reviving traditional skills, and skilled weavers from Bengal found refuge in Sualkuchi post-Covid. This convergence of talent has reinforced the village’s handloom tradition.Weaver Binita Boro reflects on the enduring appeal of the craft: “Handloom cannot die. As a child, I watched my aunt weave dreams here in Sualkuchi. Now, as an adult, I am part of this enchanting village.”","Sualkuchi is a picturesque village nestled along the brahmaputra near guwahati.

ED Cracks Down On ‘White-Collar Terror Module’, Conducts 25 Raids Linked To Al-Falah University

LUCKNOW: Fresh revelations in the probe into the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) module busted in Faridabad have exposed a sophisticated weapons procurement and explosive-manufacturing network involving arrested suspects Dr Muzammil, Dr Shaheen, Dr Adeel and Amir.Investigators said Muzammil purchased a Russian assault rifle for Rs 5 lakh through a contact linked to co-accused Dr Shaheen. The weapon was later recovered from a locker belonging to Dr Adeel, marking a breakthrough in mapping the module's arms routes.Another Russian-origin rifle, an AK Krinkov, along with a Chinese star pistol, a Beretta pistol and nearly 2,900 kg of explosive precursor material, was earlier seized in Faridabad.Officials said Lucknow-based Dr Shaheen arranged for the Russian assault rifles and deep freezer—after discreet negotiations with suppliers to avoid suspicion—on Umar's request and purchases were done by Muzzamil.The agencies are also tracking the suppliers. Overall, Rs 26 lakh was raised by the suspects, majority of the share through Shaheen.The freezer was allegedly used to store temperature-sensitive precursor chemicals essential for fabricating powerful improvised explosive devices (IEDs).Forensic teams are examining the recovered samples to identify the compounds.Intelligence sources said Shaheen not only helped arrange the rifle and freezer but also tapped her network to mobilise funds for the purchase of arms and ammunition. Sources added that the possible links could be through Afirah Bibi, the wife of Jaish commander and Pulwama attack mastermind Umar Farooq.Umar Farooq, the nephew of Jaish chief Masood Azhar, was killed in an encounter in the wake of the 2019 Pulwama attack that claimed the lives of 40 personnel of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).""The AK-56 recovery from Adeel's locker is a crucial link. It highlights the level of planning, financing and operational readiness of the module,"" an official said.The probe also revealed that Umar had extensively studied bomb-making tutorials, manuals and open-source content online and was given directions by handlers from Turkiye.He allegedly sourced chemical ingredients from Nuh, electronic components from Bhagirath Palace in Delhi and Faridabad's NIT Market and used the freezer to stabilise and process the explosive mixture.Sources added that tensions had erupted between the accused inside Al-Falah University premises over money matters, an altercation witnessed by several students. After the clash, Umar reportedly handed over his red EcoSport—already loaded with explosive material—to Muzammil.","Investigators said muzammil purchased a russian assault rifle for rs 5 lakh.

GURGAON: A seven-year-old boy playing outside his house with his father was crushed to death by a car being driven by a teenager in Maruti Kunj on Friday evening.Witnesses recalled the sudden roar of a Maruti SX4 as it sped down the narrow lane and crashed into Yohan, a Class II student. The boy was dragged for almost 20 metres on the bonnet of the car before the 15-year-old driver slammed the brakes.“It all happened in a flash. The car was going too fast for a lane as narrow as this. We heard a loud thud and rushed out to see what had happened,” said a local resident.Yohan was the only son of Ashwani Kumar, a building materials supplier and his schoolteacher wife.Residents gathered at the scene, pulled the underage driver out of the vehicle and informed police. Yohan’s family rushed him to Artemis Hospital, but he had succumbed to injuries by then.The incident left the neighbourhood shocked. “Our children play here every day. We never imagined something like this could happen right at our doorstep,” said a neighbour.An FIR was registered at Bhondsi police station under sections 106 (causing death by negligence) and 281 (rash driving) of BNS. Preliminary probe revealed that the car was not registered in the name of the minor’s father, who works for a private company.“We are trying to find out the actual owner of the car,” said an officer, adding that the vehicle could have been recently purchased second hand without updating registration records.","Yohan was dragged for almost 20 metres on the bonnet of the car before the 15-year-old driver slammed the brakes.

Parents allege ‘culture of bullying’ at private school

(With agency inputs)

JAIPUR: A Class 4 student at a Jaipur school, who died by suicide weeks ago, had reportedly faced bullying in her classroom for over 18 months, including verbal abuse from classmates, while the school failed to maintain a safe and healthy environment, according to a CBSE enquiry report.Following the findings, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) issued a show-cause notice to Neerja Modi School in Jaipur. The notice comes after a CBSE-formed enquiry panel investigated the tragic death of the 9-year-old girl, who reportedly jumped off the school building earlier this month.ACP Mansarover Aditya Kakade said that an investigation in the case is underway. ""The case is being investigated. No arrest has been made so far,"" he said.The enquiry committee highlighted multiple lapses by the school, noting the persistent bullying the girl endured. It stated that her parents had initially reported the issue to teachers in July 2024. The panel further observed that the class teacher failed to respond to the child’s distress, despite the girl approaching the teacher five times in the last 45 minutes of her life.""As per the statements of the parents given to the committee, it is clear that the school did not take any preventive and proactive action on the repeated complaints of bullying and teasing by the classmates. The class teacher and the school management were very well aware of the harassment and the trauma being faced by the deceased child,"" the board noted in the show-cause.The board further said that the conversation and communications made by the parents to the class teacher and the school management went unheard, and accused the school of not taking any action or having any compliance and provisions for a grievance redressal mechanism in such circumstances.Citing the enquiry committee report, the board said, "" it seems something unusual happened in class and she is looking extremely disturbed. A few hot discussions among students are also observed, and it may be related to the use of bad words and some derogatory comments, as per parents' observation and video footage"".The class teacher, in her written statement, admitted that the deceased student informed her about her classmate using ""bad words"" for her, but the other student denied the allegations. However, other children had complained to the teacher earlier about the constant usage of ""bad words"" in the classroom between students, the show-cause read.The board also noted that the school's committee and policy mechanism were entirely ""non-responsive"".According to the report, the parents of the deceased reported the bullying to the teachers and coordinators more than three times over the 1.5 years, yet the anti-bullying committee never contacted the parents or intervened.In September 2025, the father witnessed a boy bullying the girl during a PTM and complained to the class teacher, who allegedly advised that the child ""should adjust,"" the report says.""The school failed to maintain a healthy atmosphere and lacked specific measures to tackle bullying,"" the report states, adding that these were clear violations of CBSE guidelines, Supreme Court directives and NCPCR safety norms.The Class 4 girl tragically ended her life by jumping from the school’s fourth floor on November 1. Given the gravity of the incident, a two-member CBSE committee visited the school the following day and also met with the girl’s parents.The committee’s findings reveal a troubling pattern of harassment and neglect on that day. The girl arrived at school in a cheerful mood, but after 11 am, she became visibly upset following interactions with classmates involving a digital slate, on which some boys wrote or displayed content that embarrassed and distressed her.CCTV footage reviewed by the committee shows the girl repeatedly asking the boys to stop and erase the content. It also confirms that she approached the class teacher five times in the final 45 minutes of her life, seeking assistance, the report states.The report pulled up the teacher for failing to act on the child's distress, ""even when she approached her five times in the final 45 minutes of her life. The teacher's admitted negligence and reported aggressive response (""shouting"") directly contravenes the requirement for staff to ensure a safe, supportive environment and to act as protective caregivers,"" it said.Beyond the bullying complaints, the committee identified several safety and infrastructure lapses. These include inadequate CCTV monitoring, failure to flag the child's unsupervised movement across multiple floors and the absence of floor attendants at the time of the incident.The stairway from which the child fell had railings described as ""easily scalable and unprotected,"" and the building allegedly had more floors than permissible under school safety guidelines, the report noted.The report also pointed out violations of CBSE regulations, including the mandate to store CCTV footage for 15 days, non-compliance with child protection guidelines, and the school’s failure to offer psychological support despite clear signs of the child’s distress.Several parents gathered at Shaheed Smarak Saturday to protest and demand action against Neerja Modi School, where 9-year-old Amaira Kumar fell to her death from the fourth floor on Nov 1. They alleged that incidents of bullying at the school were ""not isolated, but rampant"".","The central board of secondary education has issued a show-cause notice to neerja modi school in jaipur.

Operation Sindoor 2.0 Talk Rises As Expert Says India Must Hit Pak But Fix White Collar Terror Too

NEW DELHI: State Investigation Agency on Saturday arrested a man in Srinagar in connection with ""white collar"" terror module case, reported news agency PTI.Authorities in Jammu and Kashmir have stepped up searches across hospitals and media offices as part of the widening probe into the Delhi blast, with investigators examining possible links between medical staff, extremist modules and networks connected to fugitive operatives.Officials told PTI the intensified scrutiny follows the recovery of arms, ammunition and nearly 3,00 kg of explosive material from a “white-collar” terror module that surfaced in south Kashmir earlier this month.In Srinagar and Anantnag, police teams, along with medical officers, checked lockers used by doctors and staff in district hospitals, private facilities, medical colleges and health centres.Officers said the drive was launched to prevent misuse of storage spaces and ensure hospital infrastructure is not exploited for illegal or hazardous activities.Every rack and locker was inspected, and staff were reminded that lockers must be used strictly for official purposes. Officials added that such checks will now form part of routine vigilance across health institutions.The operation comes after an AK-47 rifle was found in the locker of Dr Adeel Rather at the Government Medical College in Anantnag earlier this month, leading to the unravelling of a wider terror network involving multiple doctors.During Thursday’s inspection at GMC Anantnag, police and hospital administrators identified unclaimed lockers and directed that records be updated to prevent further misuse.Parallel to the hospital searches, the State Investigation Agency raided the Jammu head office of Kashmir Times and the residence of its owner, Prabodh Jamwal. The agency said arms, ammunition and incriminating documents were seized during the raids.Investigators claimed the publication is accused of promoting anti-national activities and publishing content that allegedly pushed secessionist narratives. Items recovered included a revolver, empty AK-series cases, live rounds, fired bullets, grenade safety levers and suspected pistol ammunition. These will undergo forensic and technical examination.Meanwhile, the Delhi Police Special Cell identified a new link in the Red Fort car blast case, connecting the investigation to fugitive Indian Mujahideen operative Mirza Shadab Baig. Baig, wanted for the 2008 blasts in Rajasthan and Gujarat, studied at Al Falah, an institution already under scrutiny after the “suicide bomber” in the Delhi attack was found to be a professor there.Multiple agencies are now examining networks linked to the university, which is also being probed in separate cases of alleged financial irregularities and forgery, alongside Enforcement Directorate searches conducted earlier this week.","Authorities in jammu and kashmir have stepped up searches across hospitals and media offices.

NEW DELHI: A video of a couple who were based in the US has gone viral on Instagram, where a woman explains why they moved to India after 17 years in America.She says the turning point came when she became a mother. She had twins, and only six weeks of maternity leave to recover, learn how to care for two newborns, and adjust to a completely new life. ""I was expected to go back to normal life while still healing, still learning, and still exhausted,"" she says.The woman then talks about the cost of healthcare, saying they had to meet a $14,000 yearly deductible just to use their health insurance. Their premiums kept rising, and the lowest quote they got for her and her husband alone was $1,600 a month, with a $15,000 deductible.She added, ""That did not even include our twins. Even for the smallest concern, it felt like a whole saga. Calls, co-pays, approvals, just to get basic healthcare.""Appointments for their children often took weeks, visits felt rushed, and the bills added to their stress. As parents, she says, healthcare became the last thing they wanted to fight over. ""Even for small things with the kids, it was a whole process. Appointments would be weeks out, rushed visits, high co-pays, and constant anxiety,"" she says.The couple eventually moved to India. She says, ""Moving to India wasn't about perfection, but here, healthcare doesn't feel like a luxury.""According to her, in India, they found quicker access to doctors, easier appointments, and a support system that felt within reach. ""This move wasn't about running away. It was about running towards a life where healthcare wasn't a financial burden and motherhood wasn't a solo battle. India isn't perfect, but it gave us something we didn't even realise we were missing. Balance and peace of mind.""The post has received nearly 18,000 likes, with many users sharing similar experiences. One person commented, “I moved from the States to India 15 years ago; big move but worth it.”Another said both countries have their pros and cons, but India’s support system helps families with young children, even though day-to-day challenges can be difficult.","A video of a couple who were based in the us has gone viral on instagram.

Why Gond painting still needs a new audience at home



On a humid monsoon afternoon in the early 1980s, in a village most Indians had never heard of, a Delhi artist stood silently before a mud wall. The village was Patangarh, deep inside the Mandla forests of Madhya Pradesh. The wall belonged to a modest Gond home. And on that wall, painted in earth pigments and improvised brushes, a teenage boy had created a world that seemed to move – snakes curling into rivers, birds morphing into trees, forest spirits floating above hills, every surface breathing with lines, dots and patterns.The visitor, painter and thinker J Swaminathan sensed that this was not “tribal craft” or “folk ornamentation.” It had structure, language, confidence. It was, unmistakably, contemporary art. The boy was named Jangarh Singh Shyam. Within a decade, his work would travel from Patangarh to Bhopal, from Bhopal to Delhi, and eventually to Tokyo and Paris – carrying with it an idiom that came to be known worldwide as “Gond painting. ” Those closest to him, however, insist that the truer name is “Jangarh Kalam.”Long before the words “Gond painting” appeared in gallery catalogues or GI-tag notifications, there were just mud walls, red earth and the slow, attentive labour of village hands.In the forested belt of central India, in and around Patangarh in Madhya Pradesh’s Mandla district, painting was not a profession but a way of keeping faith with the world.The Gond and Pardhan communities who live here have long believed that every hill, river, tree and rock is inhabited by spirit. Art grew out of that belief. Images of tigers, peacocks, serpents, women, ancestors and deities were painted on the inner and outer walls of homes using what the land provided: charcoal for black, geru and other clays for warm reds and browns, chhui mitti for pale yellow or white, crushed leaves for green, plant sap and cow dung as binders.These images were not “artworks” in the contemporary sense. They were part of rituals marking harvests, marriages, festivals and propitiations to Bada Dev, the Gonds’ great god. The practice — digna and bhitti chitra — sat alongside oral traditions: the songs of Pardhan bards, the sound of the single-stringed bana, the stories of origins, animals and gods. The aesthetic was functional, sacred and collective.What did not exist yet was a single, named, portable “Gond painting” style. Different villages had different motifs, and the marks on the wall faded with time, rain and replastering. The leap from wall to canvas, from ritual to recognised art form, would come much later — and decisively through one young artist from Patangarh.When we speak of Gond painting today, we are usually referring to a visual language built up from fine lines, dots and dashes, filling animal and human forms with pulsating pattern and colour. Horses, stags, fish, birds and trees are often shown in improbable combinations: a tree that is also a bird, a river that coils like a snake, a tiger whose body is made of leaves.These choices are not random decoration. They grow out of the community’s close observation of the forest, but they are also filtered through individual imagination and memory. As Mayank Singh Shyam, elder son of the late painter Jangarh Singh Shyam, explains of his father’s work:“This art emerged from my father’s soul and imagination, and on that foundation, it received the identity of a distinct style. The term ‘Gond painting’ is neither historically accurate nor rooted in our traditional practices. In India, artistic styles like Mithila, Madhubani, Warli, and Kalighat carry clear geographical identities. But Patangarh never received such recognition, and my father never called himself the creator of any ‘Gond’ style. ”His description underlines two important things. First, that what we now call Gond painting is rooted in older wall traditions, but is not simply a direct transfer of those motifs. And second, that the form in which the world sees it today was decisively shaped by one individual.“I call it the Jangarh Style, because this was a revolutionary and completely new artistic form born from my father, the late Jangarh Singh Shyam. For the first time, someone created a stylistic form based on tribal memory, experience and tradition. Before him, the mural markings and motifs in our region did not have an independent artistic identity.“If you read research papers from the 1970s, you will not find any reference to ‘Gond painting’. This name was assigned later, merely because an Adivasi artist had created paintings drawn from his imagination and life experience.”The boy whose imagination lifted that visual memory onto paper and canvas grew up in the very landscape he painted — in Patangarh, among hill slopes whose very name, many scholars point out, echoes the Dravidian root kond or konda for green hill.The turning point came in the early 1980s, when the currents of urban modern art met the currents of tribal expression in Bhopal. The mediator between these worlds was J Swaminathan — painter, poet, Marxist intellectual and one of the key figures behind Bharat Bhavan, the multi-arts complex that opened in 1982.At Bharat Bhavan, Swaminathan set up the Roopankar Museum of Folk and Tribal Art with a clear conviction: that tribal and folk artists were not anonymous “craftspeople” but contemporaries of any modern painter, thinking in their own visual philosophies. To make that visible, he travelled widely through the tribal belts of Madhya Pradesh, looking for artists whose work broke the frame of mere ritual.In 1981, that search brought him to Patangarh. On the mud walls of a house, he saw something that startled him: brilliantly imaginative scenes painted with a sureness of line that felt entirely personal rather than formulaic. The hand behind them was a teenager, Jangarh Singh Shyam.Swaminathan brought him to Bhopal. For the young painter, the move meant not just a change of geography but of medium and gaze. At Bharat Bhavan, he was given paper, canvas, brushes and poster colours. The walls of his childhood were replaced by surfaces that would not be plastered over. His images could now travel; they could be exhibited, sold, collected.In this new environment, the motifs of Patangarh began to expand. Birds and animals were no longer just auspicious elements in a domestic ritual; they became central protagonists in dense narrative fields. Trees grew bodies, gods inhabited forests, and the patterns of dots and lines began to act almost like musical notation — echoing the community’s bardic tradition in visual form.As these works began to circulate, critics and curators saw that something new was happening. This was not simply a documentation of tribal life for urban consumption; it was an authorial vision.Working at Bharat Bhavan, and later in other cities and abroad, Jangarh developed a distinctive technique: inner and outer contour lines drawn with great precision, and figures filled with comb-like strokes, rows of ovals, scales and squiggles that created an intense sense of movement. The surfaces of his paintings glowed with deep reds, electric blues and greens, bright yellows and speckled textures.The art world began to refer to this as “Jangarh Kalam” — the pen or style of Jangarh. Over time, however, as more artists from Patangarh and elsewhere adopted and adapted this vocabulary, the broader label “Gond painting” took hold, especially in the market and among urban buyers.For his family and many of his peers, this shift in terminology remains unresolved. The label “Gond painting” links the work to community identity, but it also risks erasing the very individuality that allowed it to enter the world in this form. Mayank voices that tension sharply:“People still look at traditional wall drawings and say they want the ‘traditional type of work’. They send me my father’s paintings as reference. They don’t know this is not tradition—it is a new style.“It is like salt—you cannot see it, but you taste it. You can see my father’s influence in every artist’s work. That essence is not Gond—it is Jangarh.”For the purposes of history, both terms now sit side by side: Gond painting as the larger field, Jangarh Kalam as a crucial, defining stream within it.As Jangarh’s reputation grew, so did the number of brushes and Rotring pens in Patangarh. Young men and women from the village and the surrounding Mandla forests began training, first informally, then as apprentices. Some learnt directly from him in Bhopal or during his visits; others studied his works that travelled back home.Names like Anarkali Shyam, Champi Bai Shyam, Rajesh Shyam, Santosh Maravi, Sanjay Pancheshwar and many others emerged from this context. Their paintings transformed “traditional musical memory into imaginative contemporary visuals”, as one exhibition curator put it: fairytale-like images crafted out of fine lines, scales and dots that vividly express stories based on folklore and mythology. In these canvases, animals grow into trees, trees merge into forests that seem to reach the gods, and the human figure often appears small in a world dominated by nature.The shift from charcoal and mud pigment to acrylics and ink did not mean an abandonment of older themes. Instead, it allowed them to be archived, traded and displayed. Red began to stand for the heat of the sun, yellow for energy, green for the forest’s life, blue for calmness and tranquillity. The language of colour, once dictated by whatever the soil and leaves could provide, now also responded to market demands and exhibition lighting.At the same time, Gond painting retained a quality that set it apart from much urban art: a persistent refusal to place humans at the centre of the universe. Trees, tigers, elephants and peacocks are often the real protagonists. The paintings become both celebration and warning — quietly rebelling against deforestation, urban decay and the loss of habitat by insisting, again and again, on the primacy of the more-than-human world.While many Patangarh artists continued to work in a vocabulary close to Jangarh’s, others took seriously his advice that each artist must find their own way. Nowhere is this more visible than in the work of his daughter, Japani Shyam.She grew up literally at his side: “My father is my guru. I learnt painting from him. I was very young at that time, but I still worked with him. From time to time, he would teach me things while working on his paintings, and I would follow what he showed me.“The style comes naturally. Whoever learnt from him, you can see his influence in all their work. I have seen my father doing highly experimental work. He always said that every artist should create their own distinct style.”Watching him create dazzling, highly coloured works filled with detail, she chose to move in a visually opposite direction, without abandoning the underlying grammar.“My father always worked in very colourful compositions with a lot of detailing. Detailing has always been part of our work, but I felt that I should bring something different into my own work.“In traditional Gond painting, there are bright, vibrant colours and a lot of detailing. People recognise a Gond painting immediately. In the beginning, I also worked exactly like my father.“But remembering what he told all of us — ‘create your own style’ — I started working in just two colours, with a white background. At first, people could not understand it, because they were used to seeing Gond paintings in very bright colours. So black-and-white looked very different to them.“Gradually, I explained that the story is still the same, the same nature, the same themes — I only changed the colours and medium. That is how my work began to acquire a separate identity.”Her canvases often centre women and contemporary life as much as forests and animals:“In our traditional Gond painting, the focus is mainly on nature — trees, birds, animals. That still exists, but now I take ideas from what I see in front of me.“Whether it is the city, the village, or the lives of women — most of my work has been centred around women. I observe the surroundings where I live: city life, village life, what is happening in the present time, and I work on that.“Instead of creating long mythic stories, I now work on real things around me. That is what makes my work a little different from others.”In doing so, she embodies one of the most striking features of Gond painting today: its ability to remain rooted in ritual and nature while absorbing the pressures and textures of the present — from migration and urbanisation to gendered experience.The growing popularity of Gond painting, especially in urban fairs and online platforms, has raised a familiar problem in folk and tribal arts: how to tell the difference between deep, rooted work and shallow imitation. Japani’s response to this is less about policing than about attention:“As you start understanding something deeply, you begin to recognise quality in one glance.“Today many people like Gond painting, but only a few truly understand it. On the internet, in fairs, there are many artists — some from our community, some not — all working under the name ‘Gond painting’.“Some people just think it is Gond painting, no matter who made it. But there are others who know the artist’s name, understand the story and what is actually being conveyed.“I think only those who have a genuine interest in art, and who know and understand it, can truly identify which work is deeper and distinct.”Her favourite works of her father say something about what that depth looks like: “It’s very difficult for me to choose five, because I love all of my father’s work. But personally, I especially love his works based on gods and goddesses.“The way he painted gods and goddesses — whether in drawings or colourful paintings — was entirely his own style. Their eyes, faces, mouths, noses, the jewellery, the adornment — everything was very detailed and imaginative.“Perhaps nobody imagined our deities like that before. But he created them through his imagination in such a way that they do not look frightening or wrong — just astonishing.”In those faces — neither sanitised nor terrifying — one can glimpse what made his work, and by extension Gond painting as we know it, so singular.If the story of Gond painting’s rise has the feel of a fairytale — a boy from a remote village discovered by a renowned modernist, his work travelling to museums in Tokyo, Paris and London — its central figure’s death remains a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities behind such trajectories.In 2001, while working in Japan, Jangarh died in circumstances that have since been described in official records as suicide. For his family, the questions around that moment remain raw. Mayank says simply:“This question has lived in my mind for 25 years. What happened with my father remains unanswered. Why did it happen in Japan, even though he had already travelled there twice earlier? Who facilitated his travel? Under what circumstances did everything unfold there? The truth is still unknown.“People say he was depressed, but we never knew of him taking any such medication. He loved us deeply. We could not even see him one final time—his body came home after ten days. We could not embrace him and cry.“It is the deepest wish of my mother, my siblings and mine that we go to Japan and light a lamp at the place where he breathed his last.”For the art, however, that journey from Patangarh to Japan left a lasting mark. Large murals in Japanese museums, international exhibitions in Europe and America, and high-profile sales turned Gond painting from an almost entirely local practice into a recognised category in the global art market.Despite this international acclaim, the recognition accorded at home has been uneven. Jangarh received the Madhya Pradesh government’s Shikhar Samman, and his works have entered major Indian collections. Yet, as Mayank points out, the scale of his contribution — creating an entire stylistic movement and opening a path for dozens of artists — has not been fully matched by institutional honour:“Despite creating such a revolutionary artistic movement, 25 years have passed and the government has given nothing beyond the Shikhar Award. The students he trained received honours. But the one who created the style did not. That is the biggest mistake.“We all artists believe that if this style is officially recognised as the ‘Jangarh Style’ or ‘Jan-Kalam’, it would be the greatest tribute to him.”Their demand is not only personal. It speaks to a broader question: can the state and the art establishment recognise individual Adivasi artists not merely as representatives of a community form, but as authors of styles and movements? The GI tag for Gond painting from Madhya Pradesh acknowledges geographic and community origin; what Mayank and others seek is a similar clarity around authorship within that field.Globally, Gond painting — especially works from the Jangarh lineage — enjoys a steady presence. Exhibitions in Paris, London, Tokyo and New York, illustrated books, collaborations with designers and international collectors have all kept demand alive. Mayank notes from experience:“In India, people still don’t fully understand how important this art is. I have just returned from exhibiting in Paris. Abroad, there is deep respect for it. But in India, awareness is still lacking. That is why media has a crucial role.”That role involves more than celebrating “tribal art” in occasional features or festivals. It means telling the story of how a village like Patangarh became a hub of contemporary practice; how women like Japani have taken the line and dot further into new subjects; how younger artists are using the Gond vocabulary to speak of climate anxiety, migration, caste and gender. And it means listening carefully when those within the tradition say that names matter — that “Gond painting” is not a flat, singular thing, but a field in which Jangarh Kalam occupies a defining place.From mud walls washed away each monsoon to canvases that hang in climate-controlled galleries thousands of kilometres away, the journey of Gond painting is not just a story of art. It is a story of how imagination travels: from a boy in a forest village painting what he sees and dreams, to a family and a community who continue to hold that line steady, even as the world looks on.","In and around patangarh in madhya pradesh, painting was not a profession but a way of keeping faith with the world. Images of tigers, peacocks, serpents, women, ancestors and deities were painted on the inner and outer walls of homes using what the land provided.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125505358,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-793950,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Air Quality Index (AQI) categories and associated health impacts AQI Category AQI Range PM₂.₅ Associated Health Impacts Good 0–50 0–30 Minimal impact. Satisfactory 51–100 31–60 May cause minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people. Moderately Polluted 101–200 61–90 May cause breathing discomfort to people with lung disease (e.g., asthma), and discomfort to people with heart disease, children, and older adults. Poor 201–300 91–120 May cause breathing discomfort on prolonged exposure and discomfort to people with heart disease. Very Poor 301–400 121–250 May cause respiratory illness on prolonged exposure. Effects may be more severe for people with lung or heart diseases. Severe 401–500 250+ May cause respiratory impact even on healthy people; serious health effects for people with lung/heart disease. Impacts may occur even with light physical activity.

Biology of harm: How polluted air attacks the body



Residents protest the conditions they are being forced to live in.

Big concern for pregnant mothers, babies and children



Not a dystopian movie scene, not Chernobyl - this is Delhi



Delhi breathes very poor air on 16 of 21 days in November.

Who’s most at risk — and why the poor suffer most



Personal protection: What can we do?



Here are doctor's recommendations during high AQI readings:

But these measures have their own challenges:

Stop playing, running, exercising - and if possible, stop breathing!For millions who live in and around the capital, air is no longer an invisible backdrop to daily life. It has become a persistent health hazard — an omnipresent fog that coats lungs, corrodes hearts, clouds classrooms and wards, and quietly chips away at life expectancy.Winter’s seasonal smog is the headline, but the underlying crisis is year-round: sustained high levels of fine particulate matter and other pollutants that modern medicine and public-health studies now tie to respiratory disease, heart attacks, strokes, neurological damage, and other adverse outcomes right from pregnancy all the way through old age.On many winter days, the city’s daily AQI spikes into the 'very poor' to 'severe' categories, prompting emergency public advisories and activation of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) — a set of restrictions meant to limit emissions on the worst days.India's Air Quality Index (AQI) is not capped at 500, but values above that come under the same category of 'severe'. The reason for the same is reportedly to avoid public panic and because the government believes that health impact is similar, if not same, at that level.International platforms like IQAir use different models without an upper limit and can display much higher values for the same pollution levels. India's official index is calculated based on reference-grade monitors, while other platforms may use lower-cost sensors that can have different accuracy and calculation methods.Air pollution is not a single poison but a mixture: fine particulates (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, and complex organic compounds. Of these, PM2.5 — particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometres — is the most medically alarming.These particles are small enough to evade upper-airway defenses, lodge deep in the alveoli, cross into the bloodstream and travel to other organs, provoking inflammation, oxidative stress, and systemic damage.Over time, that damage accumulates; it raises the risk for heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, adverse birth outcomes and an expanding list of neurological and metabolic conditions.Dr. Kuldeep Kumar Grover, critical care and pulmonology head, CK Birla Hospital in Gurugram, explains how the current levels of air pollution in northern India significantly increase the risk of serious medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). ""Exposure to asbestos over time raises the possibility of several cancers, including lung, bladder, and breast cancer, even for nonsmokers. """"In the short term, people may experience headaches, more frequent respiratory infections, irritation of the eyes and throat, and breathing difficulties. Toxic air is estimated to reduce life expectancy in Delhi and the surrounding area by approximately eight years,"" he added.Delhi resident Aashish Saxena has been experiencing the constant discomfort of breathing toxins. ""I am sure I have lost atleast 10 years of my life because of Delhi's toxic air. Apart from constantly coughing, I have a permanent headache throughout winter because of pollution. Since offices refuse to entertain WFH option, we are forced to commute through the deadly smog, which takes a severe toll on our health,"" he says.Clinically, the short-term effects are visible in emergency rooms and outpatient clinics: spikes in asthma attacks, bronchitis, laryngitis, allergic conjunctivitis and chest pain. Longer term, sustained exposure shortens life expectancy and increases chronic disease prevalence across cohorts — especially among children, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with pre-existing conditions.Air pollution is as much a cardiovascular risk as it is a respiratory one. Fine particles and gaseous pollutants increase blood coagulability, raise blood pressure, and accelerate atherosclerosis, which translates clinically into more heart attacks and strokes on high-pollution days and higher baseline cardiovascular mortality overall.What happens when expectant mothers inhale polluted air?""High pollution levels during pregnancy are connected with complications such as low birth weight, premature delivery, and stunted foetal development. The long-term health of the mother and child may be adversely affected by these effects,"" explained Dr Grover.Children are disproportionately harmed. They breathe faster than adults, inhale more air per bodyweight, and their lungs and immune systems are still developing — which makes the same pollution dose more damaging. ""As their lungs and immune systems are still developing, young children and infants are especially prone to the adverse effects of polluted air. worsening of asthma, recurrent infections, slower lung growth, and even impacts on brain development may arise from exposure,"" he said.Pediatric clinics in Delhi report children with recurring cough, wheeze, reduced exercise tolerance, and increased hospitalizations for acute lower respiratory infections. The lifelong consequences can include reduced maximal lung function, higher lifetime risk of chronic respiratory disease, and neurodevelopmental harms that affect learning and behavior.Manya Jain, an NCR resident, has developed breathing issues. ""After 21 years in Delhi, I’ve lived through post-Diwali pollution every single year, but it never felt like it was hitting my body directly. This year is different — I’m genuinely struggling to breathe. I don't step outside without a mask, and even then, the air feels toxic. I genuinely wish I could just leave Delhi for a few weeks,"" she said.Hospitals across the capital have reported surges in pollution-linked cases. According to recent hospital and academic alerts, outpatient numbers for respiratory and related conditions rise sharply in the weeks after critical pollution episodes.Intensive-care units report more ventilator use and complicated recoveries from routine viral illnesses — the body’s capacity to heal appears reduced when a background of continuous particulate and chemical insult persists.Vulnerability is both biological and socioeconomic.The elderly, infants, people with chronic illness and pregnant women are physiologically more susceptible. But social factors compound exposure: low-income families often live in areas with higher traffic congestion or informal industries, have less access to mitigation (sealed homes, purifiers), and more often use biomass or polluting fuels for cooking and heating.Consequently, the poorest bear the highest health burden — even though the wealthier suffer too (through private costs such as purifiers, healthcare, lost productivity, or migration). The unequal burden makes clean-air policy also an issue of equity and justice.At an individual level, N-95/FFP2 masks (properly worn) reduce inhaled particulate exposure, air purifiers lower indoor PM levels, and limiting outdoor activity on high-AQI days reduces risk.• Monitor local Air Quality Index (AQI) daily and avoid outdoor activities when levels are high• Stay indoors with windows closed during peak pollution hours• Use air purifiers, especially in bedrooms and living spaces• Avoid indoor sources of pollution such as tobacco smoke and incense• Maintain good indoor ventilation when outdoor air quality improves• Ensure children, elderly, and those with chronic illnesses use special caution during high-pollution periods- mask fit and compliance vary- purifiers work only in sealed rooms- many workers (construction, street vendors, drivers) cannot avoid outdoor exposureExperts emphasise that while personal protective measures are sensible stopgaps, only systemic emission control reduces risk for whole populations.Delhi’s smog season has become an annual indictment: years of obvious causes, predictable weather patterns, and policy options that are known, yet action has been partial and often temporary.The science is clear, the clinics are ringing the bell, and the data is unambiguous: breathing in Delhi, for too many, is now a risk that begins before birth and clouds life’s final years.","India's air quality index is not capped at 500, but values above that come under the same category of'severe' the reason for the same is reportedly to avoid public panic and because the government believes that health impact is similar, if not same, at that level. Air pollution is as much a cardiovascular risk as it is a respiratory one.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125502944,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-37996,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

AIMIM: 'Mosques can be built anywhere'



NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress (TMC) MLA has sparked a major political controversy after announcing that a foundation stone for a ""Babri Masjid replica"" would be laid in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district on December 6, marking 33 years since the demolition of the disputed structure in Ayodhya.TMC MLA Humayun Kabir had said that the ceremony would be held in Beldanga and claimed that ""several Muslim leaders"" would attend the event.""We will lay the foundation stone of Babri Masjid on 6th December in Beldanga, Murshidabad district,"" he said, adding, ""It will take three years to complete. Various Muslim leaders will participate in that event…""The declaration, made ahead of the 2026 assembly elections, drew immediate and strong reactions from the BJP, Congress and several other political leaders.Reacting strongly, BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain said, ""The foundation stone for Babri Masjid replica in Murshidabad will mark the start of Mamata govt’s collapse.”He further accused the TMC of deliberately stoking tensions. ""The TMC is trying to provoke people by building a mosque in India in the name of Babri. What kind of method is this? Babar demolished the Ram Temple; now the Ram Temple has been built there. But they are deliberately creating tension, creating dispute between Hindus and Muslims on this issue...They are trying to polarize the situation through their MLA and are trying to incite Bangladeshi infiltrators. .. All this work is being done at the behest of Mamata Banerjee, and her MLAs are getting it done,"" he added.Leader of opposition in West Bengal assembly Suvendu Adhikari also dismissed the announcement, remarking, ""First let him do it as TMC leaders only talk."" He further alleged that, ""Mamata Banerjee told him to speak in this manner…”Meanwhile, BJP leader RP Singh also condemned Kabir's remarks stating that, ""TMC is targeting Muslim votes; that's why they're making such statements claiming they're laying the foundation stone for the Babri Masjid. Their MLA in Murshidabad is saying this.""""It's unfortunate that, in pursuit of vote-bank politics, they're promoting divisive issues in the country,"" he added.Union minister Sukanta Majumdar said, ""This message should be understood by the Hindus of Bengal. People like Humayun Kabir, who have the full support of Mamata Banerjee, are trying to intimidate and threaten Hindus. They are preparing to damage and destroy the atmosphere of harmony that exists in Bengal.”He added that this was not the first such instance, recalling Kabir’s earlier comment that ""in Murshidabad, where 70% Muslims and 30% Hindus live, Muslims could, if they wished, throw Hindus into the waters of the Bhagirathi, Maa Ganga, at any time...""Congress leaders, too, criticised Kabir's comments, calling them divisive. Senior Congress leader Harish Rawat said, ""Such remarks weaken social harmony, people who make such comments are like 'supari killer'.""Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury accused the ruling TMC of engaging in competitive religious politics, stating that ""...Sometimes CM Mamata Banerjee moves temples from Puri, sometimes builds Mahakal temples in North Bengal to woo Hindu votes and show she is more Hindu than the BJP. We have no objection if temples or mosques are built, but politics that divides communities must be avoided and monitored by everyone. ..""The Murshidabad MP further reiterated that ""trying to gain support in elections under the pretext of building a temple or a mosque is not right.""""She (Mamata Banerjee) is playing temple politics to portray herself as more 'Hindu-loving' than the BJP. The other leaders of her party will also have to do something. In such a situation, they are announcing the construction of the Babri Masjid. We have no objection to this, whether a temple or a mosque is built, but trying to gain support in elections under the pretext of building a temple or a mosque is not right. We must ensure that there is no politics of polarisation. .."" he added.CPI(M) State General Secretary V. Srinivas Rao criticised the announcement on constitutional grounds. ""In my opinion, it is not the responsibility of the government to construct a mosque, temple, or any religious structure. According to the Constitution, governments must act as secular institutions, treating all citizens equally, regardless of religion..."" he said.Responding to the row, Bihar AIMIM chief and MLA Akhtarul Iman said the construction of a mosque should not be controversial. ""A mosque can be constructed in any location, as it represents a fundamental principle of humanity. Temples, churches, mosques, and gurdwaras consistently promote the value of compassion,"" he said.The TMC leadership has not formally commented on Kabir's remarks, but the issue has already snowballed into a major political flashpoint as West Bengal heads toward a charged election season.","A trinamool congress (tmc) mla has sparked a major political controversy.

AAP, Congress and SAD have resolved to protest as they are planning to meet home minister Amit Shah asking him not to move ahead with the bill.They said the current scheme where Governor of Punjab also serves as administrator of UT of Chandigarh should not be disturbed. The Constitution 131st Amendment Bill, 2025 seeks to include the UT of Chandigarh in Article 240 of Constitution, and align its administration with that of UTs without legislatures; i.e., Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu, which are all governed by LGs.

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: Two days prior to taking oath as the 53rd Chief Justice of India , Justice Surya Kant on Saturday said he does not get pressured by social media trolls, many of whom attempt to misrepresent, misquote or selectively extract court observations to create a negative impression about the judiciary despite having little knowledge of law.In an informal interaction with the media, Justice Kant said, ""I have never been pressured by the campaigns and motivated reporting on social media. I think an overwhelming majority of judges would not be affected by social media trolls as they decide cases based on facts and law.""Outlining his priorities, the CJI-designate said that in his tenure of one year and three months, he would focus on chalking out a strategy, in consultation with stakeholders, to reduce the pendency of 90,000 cases in SC and around 5 crore cases in HCs and district courts. The listing of long-pending bunch cases, whether before 9-Judge, 7-Judge or 5-Judge constitution benches, would get priority as thousands of cases, raising the same or similar questions of law, are pending in various HCs, which have deferred hearing them in anticipation of SC verdicts, he said.One such matter pending adjudication by a 9-Judge bench is the entry of women into Sabarimala temple, mosque and other custom-related religious issues.He said it is a matter of concern that despite SC judges disposing of almost as many cases as are filed every year, the pendency is increasing. Judges cannot be overburdened, whether in SC, HCs or trial courts, he said, adding that some innovative measure must be devised to tackle pendency.Mediation, he said, would be a game-changer in the future and reduce pendency in courts. It is receiving an encouraging response from public sector banks and insurance companies, which are asking the judiciary to train their personnel in mediation to resolve disputes at the pre-litigation stage. ""To use mediation to the fullest extent will be the focal point during my tenure as it is litigant-friendly and cost-effective,"" he said.","Justice surya kant said he does not get pressured by social media trolls.

VADODARA: Alleged strain over EC's special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Gujarat flared Saturday after a 50-year-old booth-level officer (BLO) assistant collapsed and died in Vadodara, another BLO in Padra suffered severe chest pain, and a teacher in Godhra went live on social media threatening to end his life over ""unmanageable demands"" tied to the drive.Four BLO-linked deaths have been reported in Gujarat over the past four days - two allegedly from cardiac arrest, one by suicide, and the cause still under investigation in the latest case.Usha Solanki, a senior clerk at Gorwa Mahila ITI assigned as BLO assistant at Pratap School in Vadodara's Kadak Bazaar, collapsed while waiting for her supervisor Saturday. She was taken to a state-run SSG hospital, where doctors declared her dead. An autopsy is pending, but she is suspected to have suffered a heart attack. Officials said she had been on SIR duty for three days.Her husband Indrasinh Solanki said she had chronic health complications and had repeatedly appealed against her assignment.Vadodara collector Anil Dhameliya rejected allegations of undue pressure, saying there was no formal leave request on record. He said the administration was trying to ease the load by avoiding night work and deploying extra staff for digitisation.BLO concerns have been conveyed to EC ""to make the process more decentralised,"" he said.At Padra town in Vadodara district, BLO and teacher Zulfikar Pathan was rushed to a Vadu primary health centre Friday night with severe chest pain. His relatives alleged he had been working extended hours and eating only one meal a day for the past fortnight. He was later shifted to a private hospital.In Godhra, BLO Vinu Bamaniya went live on social media urging colleagues to boycott SIR duties and alleging he had been threatened with ""dire consequences"" if he failed to return 200 filled forms by Saturday. Bamaniya alleged an official snapped her fingers at him. ""I understand the seriousness of the work, but cannot tolerate insults,"" he said.

KRISHNANAGAR: A 51-year-old from Nadia district became the second booth-level officer (BLO) to die by suicide in West Bengal within three days, swinging the glare on the immense pressure on these govt employees engaged for special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in various states. At least six suicides by BLOs have been reported from five states.Rinku Tarafdar, a para-teacher, was found hanging at her Krishnanagar home on Friday night. She left behind a two-page suicide note in Bengali, in which she held EC responsible for her death. ""I do not support any political party. I am a very ordinary person. But, I cannot handle this inhuman work pressure,"" she wrote, adding that despite being paid poorly, she was not given a break from BLO duty.Rinku wrote that she ""wanted to live"", but feared that she would be ""unable to handle"" the ""administrative fallout"" of not completing her work. ""I have completed 95% of the offline work, but I don't know anything about the online work. Informing the supervisor also yielded no results,"" she wrote.Her family confirmed she was struggling due to her lack of digital knowledge. ""She distributed the forms on time, but didn't know anything about uploading.This is not suicide, but murder by the EC,"" her husband Ashim Tarafdar alleged.On Wednesday, a 48-year-old anganwadi worker appointed as BLO was found hanging at her home in Jalpaiguri. Her family had claimed that her inability to speak, read or write Bengali had made the SIR form-filling process and uploading of data extremely difficult for her.Besides the two deaths in Bengal, four other states - Kerala, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu - have reported suicides.CM Mamata Banerjee took to X to express her ""profound shock"".

NEW DELHI: India has just four palliative-care centres for every 10 million people, leaving millions battling cancer, chronic illnesses and terminal conditions without timely pain relief or support, according to a new study published in cancer journal ecancermedicalscience. It also showed that people often travel nearly two hours to reach the nearest palliative-care centre, and only 23.7% of the population can access such services within 30 minutes.The study - conducted by the Association for Socially Applicable Research in collaboration with NGO Pallium India - stated that compact territories like Delhi, Chandigarh and Goa fare better due to stronger infrastructure and shorter travel distances. But most large states remain severely underserved, far from the WHO's definition of qualitative palliative care.Lead author of the study, Dr Parth Sharma, said India can achieve near-universal palliative-care access without building new infrastructure. ""If effectively leveraged, the existing public health system can deliver palliative care. Training more healthcare providers would be enough to meet population needs,"" said Sharma.""The study highlights a critical gap in India's healthcare system,"" said Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant, internal medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals. He said palliative care ""is not an elective addition but the heart of humane, person-centred care"", and called for integrating services into primary health centres, scaling home-based models, expanding specialist training and ensuring district-level access to essential pain medicines.Dr Dinesh Singh, director of radiation oncology, Action Cancer Hospital, Delhi, said the findings expose ""an urgent and deeply concerning gap"", with patients' pain, dignity and quality of life compromised when palliative care is out of reach. He urged expansion of centres, integration of palliative services in all hospitals and strengthening of home-care models.Kerala is the standout model. With only 2.5% of India's population, it hosts 44.5% of all palliative-care centres, giving 94.6% of its people access within 30 minutes.In contrast, Uttar Pradesh has just 12 centres for 17% of India's population, with a median travel time of 111 minutes. In the North-east, mountainous terrain means long travel times even where centres exist.Rural-urban gaps are equally stark, with rural travel times ranging from nine minutes to 591 minutes, underscoring deep inequity. As India's burden of cancer and chronic illness rises, the study warned that geography still decides whether a patient receives comfort - or suffers without care.","People often travel nearly two hours to reach the nearest palliative-care centre.

Uranium found in breast milk in 6 Bihar districts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uranium-found-in-breast-milk-in-6-bihar-districts/articleshow/125511777.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The study was carried out by Mahavir Cancer Sansthan, Patna, under the leadership of Dr Arun Kumar and Prof Ashok Ghosh, in collaboration with AIIMS, New Delhi, led by Dr Ashok Sharma from the department of biochemistry.Conducted between October 2021 and July 2024, the research analysed breast milk from 40 mothers aged 17-35 in Bhojpur, Samastipur, Begusarai, Khagaria, Katihar and Nalanda.Uranium (U238) was detected in all samples, with concentrations ranging from 0 to 5.25 g/L. There is no permissible limit for uranium in breast milk.Khagaria recorded the highest average contamination, Nalanda the lowest, while Katihar showed the single-highest reading. Nearly 70% of infants faced exposure levels associated with potential non-carcinogenic health risks.Co-author Dr Ashok Sharma of AIIMS said the source of contamination remains unclear. ""We do not yet know the source of the uranium; the Geological Survey of India is also trying to find out. Unfortunately, uranium comes into the food chain and causes cancer, neurological disorders and affects the growth of children - which is a very serious concern,"" Dr Sharma said.Bihar's environmental conditions have compounded the issue. The state's heavy dependence on groundwater for drinking and irrigation, discharge of untreated industrial effluents and long-term use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides have already led to contamination with arsenic, lead and mercury in biological samples. The detection of uranium in breast milk signals the contamination has reached the most vulnerable population - infants.Infants are especially vulnerable to uranium because their organs are still developing, they absorb toxic metals more readily and their low body weight amplifies exposure. Uranium can cause kidney damage, neurological impairment, cognitive delays and increase the risk of cancer later in life.Globally, elevated uranium in groundwater has been reported in Canada, the US, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, Bangladesh, China, Korea, Mongolia, Pakistan and the Mekong delta. But its presence in breast milk in Bihar takes the problem to a new level.Despite the alarming results, the researchers strongly emphasised that breastfeeding should continue. It remains irreplaceable for immunity and early development, and should be discontinued only on medical advice. With uranium from contaminated groundwater being traced in the most essential nutrition an infant receives, the study calls for urgent biomonitoring, rigorous water-quality testing and immediate public-health intervention.Considering the threat it poses to the most vulnerable of humankind, the research is a call for action.","Uranium (u238) was detected in all samples, with concentrations ranging from 0 to 5.25 g/l.
