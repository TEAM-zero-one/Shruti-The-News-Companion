‘Hijab-Clad PM’ Row: Owaisi’s ‘Tubelight’ Jab At Himanta Sarma Over ‘Only Hindu PM’ Remarks

'Hindutva a political tract'

'Cherishing Hinduism is Hindutva'

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar stirred another row on Sunday after he said Hindutva is ""Hinduism in paranoia,"" which drew a strong response from the ruling BJP During the debate on ""Hinduism Needs Protection From Hindutva"", hosted by the Calcutta Debating Circle, Aiyar said Hindutva is a BJP leader ""slapping a blind, hungry tribal girl because she attends a Christmas lunch in a Church"".Aiyar also said Hindutva asks ""80 per cent of Hindus to quiver in front of 14 per cent of Muslims"".""Hindutva is Hinduism in paranoia. It asks 80% Hindus to quiver in front of 14% Muslims. Hindutva is a BJP leader slapping a blind, hungry tribal girl because she attends a Christmas lunch in a Church. Hindutva raids shopping malls to tear down Christmas decorations,"" said Aiyar during the debate.He also quoted VD Savarkar, saying that the Hindutva ideologue saw Buddhism as an existential threat to all Hindus.""He described it as the ultimate negation of Hindutva, bearing the opiate of universalism and nonviolence. He said it was disastrous to national virility and even the existence of the Hindu race,"" said Aiyar, referring to Savarkar.Drawing a distinction between Hinduism and Hindutva, Aiyar said Hinduism is ""a great spiritual religion, while Hindutva is a political tract."" He also said that Hinduism faced trials and tribulations yet managed to survive and flourish without any need for Hindutva's protection.""Hinduism is a great spiritual religion. Hindutva is a political tract. Hindutva came only in 1923; for thousands of years before Hindutva, Hinduism faced trial and tribulation and yet survived, flourished, with no need of Hindutva protection... There is no way Gandhi's and Swami Vivekananda's Hinduism can be protected or promoted by Savarkar's Hindutva,"" Aiyar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Speaking at the same event, Rajya Sabha member and BJP leader Sudhanshu Trivedi said that Hindutva represents 'Hindu tattva,' which forms the core essence of Hinduism.He further argued that Hinduism is unique among religions in granting its followers the authority to debate, even on its sacred texts.""... Which culture gives you the authority to debate even on religious texts. It is only Hindu... I would like to ask why the term Hinduism? Why is 'ism' associated with all the religions which originated in India? Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism. You have never heard of Islamism and Christianism... The 'ism' world is being associated just to demean, and what Hindutva is, 'Hindu tattva'. The basic immunity of Hinduism is Hindu tattva. .. Another thing I would like to say, when you cherish Hinduism, it is called Hindutva,"" the Trivedi said.Lashing out at Aiyar's remark, the BJP's national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari said: ""Yet again Congress attempts to create a divide between Hindus.""They want 1 Hindu to Stand up against the other Hindu. This benefits Congress whose only focus is -""Consolidate Vote Bank: Unite Minority, Divide Hindu Majority,"" he said.","Congress leader mani shankar aiyar stirred another row on sunday after he said hindutva is ""hinduism in paranoia"" the remark drew a strong response from the ruling bjp.

Bengaluru Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know.







BENGALURU: At least six people waiting on the footpath had a close shave late Thursday night when a drunk software engineer lost control of his car and rammed the wall of a restaurant on Indiranagar 100 Feet Road.The 42-year-old techie, returning home alone after a party, drove his sedan at high speed from a side lane, jumped the median, crashed through flower pots and rammed the wall of Barbeque Nation restaurant before coming to a halt.Traffic police said the accident occurred around 11.30pm.CCTV footage showed the car hurtling straight ahead instead of turning left onto the main road, sending people scrambling for safety.Six people, including women, were standing outside the restaurant when the vehicle came charging towards them. A youth sustained injuries in the crash, while two vehicles were damaged.The driver was identified as Derrik Tony, a resident of Domlur and employee of a private technology firm. Police confirmed he was driving under the influence of alcohol. ""It was fortunate that no one was run over because traffic was heavy at that time.A few seconds' difference could have resulted in multiple fatalities at the spot,"" said a traffic police officer.Based on a complaint from a staff member of the restaurant, Jeevan Bima Nagar traffic police booked Tony for rash/negligent driving and drunk driving, and his vehicle has been seized. Police said he will have to appear before court and pay a fine to secure the vehicle's release.DCP traffic (east), Sahil Bagla told TOI, ""We subjected the accused driver to medical and alcohol tests.

'Called Minor Matter, Refused FIR': Tripura Student Angel Chakma's Father Blasts Uttarakhand Police

'Oye Chinese '



Anjel Chakma

'I am an Indian'



'Do you even get Maggi there?'



Do you even get Maggi there? How do you survive with all the non-veg food? I also heard you people eat cats and dogs. A colleague asked Sushma, who hails from Assam

Fear during Covid



'My only mistake is that I look like this'



Nido Taniam

India has seen such cases for years



A legal vaccum



""You people eat dogs, cats, pigs and all your animals, right?"" This was a question Riba says she was repeatedly asked because she hails from the Northeast.Working at a high-profile firm did little to shield her from stereotypes. Friends, colleagues and acquaintances routinely questioned her food habits, appearance and even language.What hurt most, she says, was that many people did not see anything wrong with asking such questions.""It definitely triggered me being questioned every day about what I eat, how I look and where I belong,"" she recalls.That casual prejudice, civil rights activists say often escalates into something far more dangerous.These day-to-day casual slurs, which come as no surprise in the lives of people from the Northeast, reveal that even India’s so-called cosmopolitan ""melting pots"" often fail to be truly inclusive.For many from the region living outside it, these cities remain spaces where identities are questioned and belonging is never fully accepted.On December 9, what began as a routine visit to a local market in Dehradun ended in fatal violence.Twenty-four-year-old Anjel Chakma from Tripura lost his life.Anjel and his younger brother Michael had been planning a Chandrashila trek scheduled for December 22 and had even ordered new trekking shoes for the trip.The shoes arrived a day after the attack. They were never unpacked.According to Michael and other family members, the brothers were subjected to racial slurs — "" Chinki ,"" ""Chinese"" and ""Momo"" during a grocery run in the Selaqui area. One of the men allegedly sneered, ""Oye Chinese, have you come to buy pork?""Anjel objected to the abuse and asserted their identity. ""We are not Chinese… We are Indians. What certificate should we show to prove that?"" he allegedly said.What followed, according to family and friends, was brutal violence.""Soon after Anjel replied, they attacked him and his brother while hurling abuses,"" said a friend who stayed at the hospital through the two weeks that followed. ""Anjel suffered serious injuries to his neck and spine. Michael is also injured and remains in serious condition.""Dehradun senior superintendent of police Ajai Singh said the comments appeared to target the brothers’ appearance. Police said Anjel was struck with a knife and a metal kada, leaving him critically injured.The case drew national attention after Anjel’s father said his son was attacked despite clearly asserting that he was Indian.Similar incidents occur with alarming regularity.Arjun Rimo from Arunachal Pradesh recalls a recent incident in Delhi that left him shaken. ""On January 8, 2026, in Karol Bagh, New Delhi, while buying meat at a shop, I was mistreated,"" he told TOI.""As I chose to leave, I was subjected to racial abuse and called ‘Chinese’. I immediately objected and stated that I am an Indian.""He said a person associated with the shop attacked him first.""I reacted only in self-defence. I punched him, during which he sustained a facial injury. Soon after, two more individuals joined him, and the three of them assaulted me together.""As a crowd of 30 to 35 people gathered, Rimo said he became overwhelmed.""I could no longer protect myself. Fearing serious harm, I sought police assistance,"" he said, adding that he personally witnessed the accused being taken into police custody.""This episode,"" he said, ""highlights a broader, long-standing challenge faced by citizens from India’s North-Eastern region,"" who frequently encounter bias and unequal treatment when living or travelling outside their home states, particularly in metropolitan cities.For many, stepping outside the Northeast means confronting suspicion, stereotyping and casual prejudice — not as isolated incidents, but as an everyday reality.For Sushma Pegu, who works at a high-profile firm in Bengaluru, discrimination followed her into corporate spaces.She recalls being bullied, subjected to racial slurs, and questioned relentlessly about her food habits.""A colleague literally asked me, ‘Do you even get Maggi there? How do you survive with all the non-veg food? I also heard you people eat cats and dogs.’""""I took a stand,"" she said, adding that the colleague was eventually terminated.But the questioning, she said, often begins the moment she steps into a cab, with drivers routinely asking, ""Which country are you from?"" prompted solely by her appearance.Roshni recalls how racial prejudice intensified during the Covid-19 outbreak.""During my time at Lakshmibai College,"" she said, ""a group of students passed a remark about one of my friends, saying, ‘Mujhe toh isko dekh kar dar lag raha hai’ (I feel scared just looking at her).""She said the comment, though made casually, carried a deep sense of exclusion and fear.""I felt shocked, angry and deeply uncomfortable,"" she said.""It created a lasting sense of humiliation and helplessness.""In October 2025, a 27-year-old flight attendant from Meghalaya alleged that she was racially abused twice within an hour in Delhi; first in north Delhi's Kamla Nagar and later on the metro.Her Instagram video went viral after Union minister Kiren Rijiju reposted it.In the video, the woman said a group of men sitting on a scooter mocked her using racial slurs and laughed. Shaken, she walked into a nearby Tibetan eatery but found herself unable to eat.""I did not feel like eating anything. My brain could not process what had just happened,"" she said.""It breaks my heart,"" she added. ""My only mistake is that I am born in India and I look like this and I don’t look like what people expect Indians to look like.""Having travelled to several countries, she said she had never been made to feel unwelcome abroad.""But today, in my own country, my fellow Indians made me feel like I did not belong.""Addressing the alleged perpetrators, she said, ""You didn’t just insult me. You insulted every person who has ever felt ‘othered’ in their own country. India is diverse our faces, our languages and our cultures are all valid. You don’t get to decide who belongs and who doesn’t.""Such incidents are far from isolated.In November 2023, students from the Northeast reported racial and misogynistic abuse near Delhi University’s North Campus. In 2016, two youths from Mizoram were beaten in Bengaluru for not speaking the local language.One of the most chilling cases remains the killing of Nido Taniam in January 2014. The 19-year-old student from Arunachal Pradesh was beaten to death in Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar after shopkeepers mocked his hairstyle.A police investigation report detailed how Nido and his friends had gone to meet another friend when a shopkeeper made derogatory remarks about his appearance.An altercation followed, during which Nido smashed a glass pane. The shopkeeper and his associates allegedly assaulted him while making racist remarks about his caste, race and appearance.Although the immediate dispute was settled after Nido paid compensation, he was later assaulted again by the group and died in his sleep at a friend’s residence.The incident sparked widespread outrage among people from the Northeast living in Delhi, with allegations that the police failed to protect him despite repeated pleas.India is a signatory to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, yet does not have a specific law addressing racial discrimination.Following Nido Taniam’s death, the MP Bezbaruah Committee recommended criminalising racial slurs such as ""chinki"" and ""Chinese"", proposing jail terms of up to five years.While some administrative steps were taken, the proposed amendments to the IPC remain pending.In 2016, the Supreme Court directed the Centre to monitor the implementation of the committee’s recommendations. Activists, however, say enforcement remains inconsistent, with racial abuse often dismissed as a social issue rather than treated as a criminal offence.These incidents show how deeply racial prejudice is woven into everyday life. While stronger laws are necessary, activists argue they are not sufficient on their own.The fight, they say, must begin in schools, through education on diversity, history and discrimination. It must be carried forward by police, institutions, political parties and society at large.Multiculturalism cannot remain a slogan. It must be practised.","Civil rights activists say casual prejudice often escalates into something far more dangerous. Even india’s so-called cosmopolitan ""melting pots"" often fail to be truly inclusive. For many from the region living outside it, these cities remain spaces where identities are questioned.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126465493,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-68780,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

‘Attack On My Life’: Suvendu Adhikari Targets Mamata Banerjee, Levels Serious Allegation

NEW DELHI: BJP on Sunday dismissed West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee 's contention that her dramatic intervention in the ED raids at I-PAC premises in Kolkata was in her capacity as TMC president, and suggested that her compulsion to remove evidence linking "" coal scam "" proceeds to her party might be the real reason.BJP Lok Sabha member Ravi Shankar Prasad also hit out at the state govt for the alleged attack on its Bengal leader Suvendu Adhikari's convoy and said no FIR was registered despite BJP's complaint. He said BJP functionaries have often been at the receiving end of such violence, often in the presence of state police.Slamming Banerjee, he said she was seen clutching a specific green file, which was removed during ED raids, and shrugged off her assertion that the central agency was looking to steal her party's poll strategy, including the list of its probable candidates. ""Why did a CM have to personally retrieve a file during a raid? What specific incriminating evidence was in that green file? Names of coal scam beneficiaries, the TMC leaders involved, the route of the hawala money, or the list of officers who facilitated the smuggling,"" he asked.Prasad alleged that her ""desperation"" might be linked to the tunnelling of hawala money to fund her party's campaign in the last Goa assembly polls.",Bjp lok sabha member ravi shankar prasad also hit out at the state govt for the alleged attack on its bengal leader suvendu adhikari's convoy.

KOCHI/THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala Congress MLA Rahul Mamkootathil, 36, was arrested Sunday and remanded in judicial custody in a third rape case , capping a dramatic police operation following CM Pinarayi Vijayan's intervention.Police said the Palakkad MLA used his position to sexually abuse women. A court sent him to jail after Kerala police crime branch investigators said he could intimidate complainants, influence witnesses and destroy evidence.Congress on Sunday distanced itself from the MLA, with party senior K Muraleedharan saying Mamkootathil had been removed after the allegations surfaced. ""After that, he is no longer our responsibility, and the party is not answerable for anything,"" he said.The latest case stems from an alleged assault on a 31-year-old woman at a hotel in Thiruvalla on April 8, 2024. The arrest followed what police sources described as urgent directions from Vijayan after the complainant sent a voice message on Jan 8 expressing fear for her family. Police dropped plans to wait for her return from abroad for a magistrate's statement. The state police chief approved the operation around 8pm Saturday, and officers moved quickly to pre-empt a bail bid.Crime branch units in Kollam and Pathanamthitta registered a case and said Mamkootathil refused to unlock his phone. Police seized the device, conducted a potency exam, and collected blood for DNA testing. Officers arrested him at 12.30 am at a hotel in Palakkad, took him to Pathanamthitta's armed reserve camp for questioning, recorded the arrest at 7.30 am, and produced him in court.","Kerala congress mla rahul mamkootathil, 36, was arrested sunday and remanded in judicial custody in a third rape case.

Amit Shah Confident BJP Will Form Government In Kerala In 2026, Vote Share Climbing

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Union home minister Amit Shah demanded Sunday Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan 's resignation and warned of statewide BJP protests unless a ""neutral probe"" is ordered into an alleged gold heist linked to Sabarimala hill shrine.""It is time for CM Pinarayi Vijayan to go, as LDF could not safeguard Sabarimala and also could not bring development to the state,"" Shah said, addressing party workers at a felicitation function for BJP winners in local body polls in Thiruvananthapuram. He said the FIR in the case was ""designed to protect the real culprits"" and questioned how justice could be ensured ""when ministers are involved"".The alleged gold heist linked to Sabarimala in Pathanamthitta district has triggered political accusations, with BJP claiming a cover-up and seeking a probe independent of Kerala police. Left Democratic Front (LDF) govt denies wrongdoing. According to the state-appointed SIT, gold embedded in sacred structures was allegedly stripped, diverted and converted in 2015 through a planned operation involving temple officials, intermediaries and private jewellers.Setting the tone for BJP's campaign ahead of the 2026 Kerala assembly elections, Shah predicted a breakthrough. ""The lotus will bloom in the state as BJP will assume office in 2026,"" he said.""Our aim is to develop Kerala, to protect the state from anti-nationals, and safeguard the centuries-old devotion of the people.""He accused both LDF and Congress-led opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) of ""match-fixing"" that led to stagnation. ""Communist parties are wiped out from the entire world and Congress has been wiped out in India. The path to development of Kerala is with NDA under the leadership of Modi-ji,"" Shah said, linking Kerala's future to PM Narendra Modi's goal of a developed India by 2047.Citing BJP's growth, Shah said vote share rose from 16% in 2019 to 20% in 2024 and claimed the jump to ""30% to 40%"" would come in 2026. ""I am confident that BJP state president Rajiv Chandrasekhar can end this musical chair by LDF and UDF,"" he said.Drawing parallels with other states, Shah listed BJP's rise from marginal presence to govt in Assam, Manipur, Tripura, and UP.

LUCKNOW: A central GST inspector posted in New Delhi has been named an accused in a Rs 100-crore tax evasion racket uncovered by UP's Special Task Force (STF), a case that investigators said exposed deep collusion between tax officials and a network of shell firms.Inspector Mohit Agrawal, who is on the run, is accused of providing departmental protection and manipulation in return for bribes, STF officials said Sunday. Teams have been deployed to trace and arrest him.The case registered at Kavi Nagar police station in Ghaziabad district centres on large-scale GST fraud through bogus firms, fake e-way bills and forged invoices. On Friday, STF arrested four accused - New Delhi-based scrap dealer Hardeep Singh alias Prince, along with Jitendra Jha, Punit Agrawal and Shivam Singh. Investigators alleged the syndicate floated multiple shell companies and generated fake e-way bills to illegally claim input tax credit, causing estimated loss of nearly Rs 100 crore to govt.During the probe, evidence emerged showing inspector Agrawal allegedly actively aided the operation. STF officers said he accepted bribes to restore suspended firms, shield fake entities from scrutiny and manipulate records.One such firm, Adon Automobile, allegedly linked to Punit Agrawal, was suspended around three months ago but restored after inspector Agrawal's intervention. Investigators clai-med he accepted Rs 40,000 for the favour. STF also pointed to the role of Alok, a Haryana-based facilitator who allegedly supp-lied fake firms to Hardeep Singh for a lump-sum commission.WhatsApp chats recovered from Punit's phone allegedly detail discussions on payments and record manipulation, officers said, and indicated more arrests were likely as investigators widen the net across UP and neighbouring states.","Inspector mohit agrawal, who is on the run, is accused of providing departmental protection and manipulation in return for bribes.

BMC Becomes Mega Battleground As Thackerays Reunite And Alliances Shift Ahead Of Civic Wars 2026

NAGPUR: Maharashtra govt's decision to credit Mukhyamantri-Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana instalments for Dec 2025 and Jan 2026 to beneficiaries' accounts on Jan 14, the eve of municipal polls, has become a flashpoint between BJP-led Mahayuti and opposition Congress.Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) moved state election commission (SEC), objecting to govt's decision to credit two months' instalments, totalling Rs 3,000, barely 24 hours before the civic polls. It termed the release plan a ""collective govt bribe"", accusing it of violating model code of conduct to influence over 1 crore women voters. The party urged the commission to direct govt to release the funds only after polling concludes.Revenue minister and Nagpur district guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule on Sunday dismissed Congress's objections as political opportunism, asserting that women beneficiaries could not be held hostage to election schedules as the Ladki Bahin scheme predated the announcement of civic polls and had ""nothing to do with municipal elections"".""This is an ongoing welfare programme of the state govt. For polls in 29 civic bodies, women across the entire state cannot be deprived of their rightful benefits,"" he told a press conference, adding any attempt to stall payments would amount to discrimination against women.Bawankule accused Congress of hypocrisy and obstructionism. ""When this govt launched the scheme, Congress tried everything to stop it.

Congress’s in-charge for Tamil Nadu Girish Chodankar had asked if any political party “will say that they don't want the power; then we should name ourselves as NGO.”Periyasamy’s remarks assert DMK’s long-held position on governance in the state. Since 1967, both the DMK and the AIADMK have formed governments on their own despite contesting elections as part of alliances.The only exception dates back to the first assembly (1952–57) in the then Madras state, when the Congress, lacking an absolute majority, accommodated non-Congress leaders in its Cabinet.In 2006, the DMK ran a full five-year government despite falling short of a majority, relying on outside support from allies, including the Congress, but without sharing ministerial power. Congress leaders had made similar demands during that term as well, without success.","Senior dmk leader and rural development minister i periyasamy ruled out any scope for a coalition government in tamil nadu.

Deepam row: Piyush Goyal Accuses MK Stalin Govt Of Targeting Hindu Traditions

Even within TN Cong, some do not press for a coalition government

With inputs from agencies

DINDIGUL: Tamil Nadu's governing DMK has rejected demands from a section of ally Congress's state unit for a share in power after this summer's assembly polls, with minister I Periyasamy asserting on Sunday that there ""would be no coalition govt here"".Speaking in Dindigul, Periyasamy pointed out that Tamil Nadu had always been governed by a single party and the tradition would continue even after the ensuing elections. This is the first time DMK has formally rejected the demand, which has gained traction over the past several months.Periyasamy, DMK deputy general secretary and rural administration minister, admitted that Congress was within its rights to put forth the demand but made it clear that CM M K Stalin wasn't inclined to accept. ""Tamil Nadu has always had single-party rule. The CM is firm on this,"" Periyasamy said.The remarks come amid the chorus for powersharing growing louder. Sections of Congress, including MP Manickam Tagore, have stressed that no party can win elections on their own in Tamil Nadu and the time has come for a discussion on coalition govts. Tagore had said the debate was no longer just about winning power but also about sharing it.Although DMK has credited its alliance for its successive electoral victories, the party has consistently resisted power-sharing demands. DMK’s other allies, too, are divided on the issue — unlike Congress, VCK, Left parties and MDMK do not insist on coalition govts. Even within Congress, there are voices, including that of state chief K Selvaperunthagai, who do not press for the demand. However, AICC incharge for Tamil Nadu, Girish Chodankar, has pushed for coalitions, suggesting political parties should call themselves “NGOs” if they declare they don’t want power.","Dmk has rejected demands from a section of ally congress's state unit for a share in power after this summer's assembly polls.

HYDERABAD: A 26-year-old vendor was arrested on Sunday for alleged desecration of a place of worship in Hyderabad's Safilguda. Cops said the incident took place around 8.30 pm on Saturday when the man, who had come from Bidar in Karnataka a month ago, allegedly entered the Katta Maisamma temple and resorted to an indecent act before the idol.""We contacted police in Bidar and found there are no criminal cases against him. But there is a document certified by Bidar authorities that he is not mentally sound,"" said an officer, adding that the accused would be taken into police custody, after seeking the court's permission, to ascertain his mental condition and know how he reached the temple and why he was involved in the alleged offence.A purported video of the accused being confronted by locals, after he allegedly defecated near the temple's entrance, has gone viral on social media platforms, leading to dozens of protesters gathering and demanding strict action. Telangana BJP chief N Ramchander Rao, who joined the crowd, alleged the Congress govt has failed to initiate any action against those responsible for such offences. ""Hindus are under threat. We will initiate a cultural movement,"" he said.","A 26-year-old vendor was arrested on sunday for alleged desecration of a place of worship in hyderabad's safilguda.

Different words. The same grim picture.



The never-ending list of restrictions



‘Staying within limits’ does not protect women



Shifting the focus: From victims to perpetrators



The way forward

“Only when Sitaji crossed the Lakshman rekha was she kidnapped by Ravan ,” BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya said in 2013, invoking the mythological boundary as a warning for women to stay “within limits” to avoid being abducted by “Ravanas”.The remark was widely criticised at the time. Yet its underlying message was unmistakable: when violence occurs, the woman must have stepped out of line.Statements like these reflect a long-standing pattern in which responsibility quietly shifts from the perpetrator to the victim — from the act of violence itself to a woman’s choices, movements and behaviour.This is not about one leader, one party or one careless remark. It is about a mindset — deeply embedded across politics, courts, families and everyday conversations — that continues to search for causes of sexual violence in women’s conduct rather than men’s decisions.Back in 2013, Vijayvargiya’s comments were condemned. More than a decade later, the language may have softened, the metaphors may have changed — the thinking has not.Fast forward to 2025, and similar blame once again dominated headlines.Last October, a second-year medical student was gang-raped near her institute campus in Durgapur after stepping out for dinner with a male classmate. In response, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said that “girls should not be allowed to come outside at night-time.”The remark drew political backlash. BJP MP Bansuri Swaraj accused Banerjee of justifying rape and called the comment reflective of a “regressive mindset.” Banerjee later said her words had been distorted and taken out of context.But once again, the focus had shifted — away from the crime, toward policing women’s behaviour.Victim-blaming is not confined to political rhetoric. At times, it seeps into judicial language as well.In March 2025, the Allahabad High Court granted bail to a man accused of raping a woman he met at a bar in Delhi’s Hauz Khas, observing that the “victim herself invited trouble.”The comment drew sharp scrutiny from the Supreme Court. Justices B.R. Gavai and Augustine George Masih cautioned judges against such observations, stating that while bail may be granted, courts must be careful in how they speak about survivors of sexual violence.In 2021, Karnataka MLA KR Ramesh Kumar sparked nationwide condemnation after saying in the assembly that “when rape is inevitable, lie down and enjoy it” — a statement that drew laughter from some members.The remark was later withdrawn, with Kumar apologising and claiming he had no intention of insulting women or the House. But the damage lay not just in the words, but in the ease with which they were spoken and received.Time and again, public discourse around sexual violence drifts away from the crime itself and toward moral instruction for women — where they should go, how they should dress, and when they should be visible.From warnings like “don’t cross limits” to strict rules such as “don’t step out at night,” the underlying message remains the same — women must continue to change and modify their lives to prevent crimes they did not commit. For many, these limitations are not a matter of choice but an evil necessity, adopted as precautions to stay safe and protected.For many families, these restrictions are framed as protection, not control. The mother of a 19-year-old told TOI that while she had no issue with her daughter’s clothes or independence, that freedom felt conditional.“When we’re around, we feel she is safe,” she said. “But when she’s alone, it’s different.”Another woman from Noida described the same conflict. “I want my daughter to live freely,” she said. “But with crime rates so high, fear always wins.”However, no matter what measures women take, it is never really safe.A 21-year-old college student told TOI about a frightening experience returning late to her college hostel. “A car with 4-5 men slowed down near me, and one called out, ‘ee aaja’ (hey, come here). My instincts said to run, but I felt numb and just kept walking. They eventually drove off, but those few seconds traumatised me,” she said, adding that she was dressed modest.A Delhi-based corporate worker told TOI, “Though my parents are supportive and trust me, they still set what they think are ‘reasonable’ restrictions for my safety—like a curfew and discomfort with certain clothes since I use public transport here. Given the city’s crime rates, they believe dressing modestly and getting home before dark helps avoid unwanted attention. It’s as if it’s normal for women not to go out at night—that’s the reality. ”This is the quiet burden women grow up carrying — not just fear of violence, but fear of blame.The idea that safety lies in restraint collapses under data.According to NCRB figures from 2023, 97.5% of reported rape cases were committed by someone known to the victim. Homes, families and relationships — not streets alone — are often where violence occurs.Supreme Court advocate Barnali Basak told TOI that social stigma prevents many survivors, particularly from privileged backgrounds, from reporting sexual violence.“The fear of social judgment outweighs the crime itself,” she said.Children remain among the most vulnerable. Experts warn that abuse within families often goes unreported for years, silenced by fear, dependency and shame.Akansha Rastogi, a developmental psychologist at Children First, told TOI, “When a child reports abuse but is ignored or silenced, the psychological impact can be severe. Their boundaries are violated, and they lose their sense of control. This can lead to long-term mental health issues, insecurities, and difficulties trusting others.” She further added that trauma is often stored in the body, as it keeps“the score, which can affect future relationships and intimacy in unpredictable ways. ”Dr Medha, assistant professor of psychology at Patna Women’s College, explained that victim-blaming functions as a psychological defence.She explained, “Victim-blaming helps people feel safe. It reduces fear, protects social beliefs, and maintains existing power structures.”“People want to believe the world is fair,” she said. “Blaming the victim creates distance — ‘this won’t happen to me.’”But the reality, experts stress, is simple: rape is not caused by clothing, behaviour or timing. It is an act rooted in power, entitlement and control. “Rape is not caused by a woman’s clothes, behavior, or personality…rape occurs even when women are: fully covered, elderly, children, disabled, or in safe places. These cases clearly show that clothing or “attractiveness” is not the cause,” Dr Medha explained.Women are raped at home, by relatives, by husbands, in daylight, while fully covered, and even as children. If clothing or visibility were causes, these patterns would not exist.The conclusion is unambiguous: rape happens because some men choose to violate.Blaming women does nothing to prevent it. Holding perpetrators accountable does.Ending victim-blaming requires a fundamental shift — from asking “Why was she there?” to asking “Why did he do this?”Blaming the victim can create a false sense of security: “If I don’t do that, it won’t happen to me.” But this is an illusion. Sexual violence occurs not because someone was visible, friendly, or outside—it happens because someone felt entitled, lacked empathy, or chose to misuse power.According to trauma psychologist Judith Herman, healing begins when survivors are believed, not interrogated.“Blaming women is fear-based,” she writes. “Believing women is justice-based.”A society that stops blaming survivors is not becoming weaker. It is becoming more honest.","The focus has shifted away from the crime, toward policing women’s behaviour. For many, these limitations are not a matter of choice but an evil necessity.

Rare visits do not amount to shared conjugal life: HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rare-visits-do-not-amount-to-shared-conjugal-life-hc/articleshow/126472115.cms,".

KOLKATA: ""Once in a blue moon"" visits do not amount to a shared conjugal life, Calcutta high court said on Jan 8 while granting divorce to a couple living apart since 2015, ruling that a marriage stripped of empathy cannot be sustained. The court dissolved the marriage but allowed the father monthly access to his son.A division bench of Justices Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya and Supratim Bhattacharya held that irretrievable breakdown of marriage qualifies as cruelty under Special Marriage Act, extending a 2023 Supreme Court ruling under Hindu marriage law to cases governed by the 1954 statute.The wife, a medical professional posted in Kurseong in north Bengal's Darjeeling district, approached the HC after a lower court in 2022 refused divorce on grounds of cruelty and desertion. The couple married in 2007, lived in Howrah and had a son in 2011. Her earlier postings were in Malda and Birbhum, both in south-central Bengal, before she returned to Howrah and later moved to Kurseong.She argued they had been living separately since 2015, with only occasional visits by the husband and no marital relationship. She also complained the trial court had blocked testimony from her colleagues about alleged abuse at her workplace, even refusing video-conference evidence on grounds of ""insufficient infrastructure"".The HC disagreed, finding cruelty and desertion proved. It said the husband admitted living separately except for stray visits and failed to back claims of brief cohabitation. It also faulted rejection of video evidence on flimsy grounds.Judges pointed to contradictions in the husband's stand - opposing divorce while seeking continued access only to the child. ""When the convivial atmosphere is lost in a matrimonial relationship and all empathy dries up, nothing remains in the marriage for it to be sustained,"" the court said, declaring the marriage irretrievably broken.The husband may meet the child once a month, on the first Sunday, for two hours at a public place.","Calcutta high court grants divorce to a couple living apart since 2015.

Saif Ali Khan Revisits Knife Attack Horror, Admits Thought of Being Bedridden Still Scares Him

BHOPAL: A local court in Bhopal dismissed a civil suit challenging ownership of a 16.62-acre parcel of prime land once linked to the erstwhile Bhopal royal family, ruling in favour of actor Saif Ali Khan , Sharmila Tagore, Soha Ali Khan and other legal heirs of the royal family, who were respondents in the case.The dispute related to land in Nayapura area of Huzur tehsil, where three residents claimed ownership. They argued the property was gifted to their father, late Vakil Ahmed, by the last ruling Nawab of Bhopal, Hamidullah Khan, in 1936 as a reward for services rendered by him and his ancestors during the princely era.The plaintiffs relied on entries in old revenue records and claimed continuous possession of the land, including construction of rooms, engagement of caretakers and allotment of small portions to others for residence and upkeep.However, in its order last week, court rejected the claims on multiple grounds. It held the plaintiffs failed to conclusively prove the alleged inayat (gift). It also found that the disputed land formed part of the personal property of Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi as mentioned in Bhopal merger agreement signed with govt of India in 1949.Court records showed following a family partition, 12.62 acres of the land were sold to a builder in 1998 by Pataudi and his family, preceded filing of the present suit.","The dispute related to land in nayapura area of huzur tehsil, where three residents claimed ownership.
