The teacher has been arrested.""I have always dreamt of becoming a police officer. Science and maths are my favourite subjects. I'll choose my academic stream based on my board results,"" said the 15-year-old whose parents are agricultural labourers.The turmoil in her life was unleashed just 11 days after her rousing Republic Day speech on the importance of saving the girl child and educating her. The 33-year-old schoolteacher allegedly assaulted her after luring her to a hotel on the pretence of his birthday celebrations. He is also accused of threatening to fail her in the board exam.Ever since the Feb 7 horror, the girl has been living with her father's sister, who has two exam-facing daughters. ""We don't want people and relatives streaming in daily and disturbing her studies,"" her uncle said.As she maintains the same unwavering dedication to her studies as she did before her ordeal, immense emotional support has come from her two cousins, who study alongside her, offering her company in these trying times. ""We are incredibly proud of her courage and determination. We will support her every step of the way, regardless of the challenges that lie ahead,"" said her uncle.Living in a joint family, most members make a living as agricultural labourers. ""We don't want our future generation to toil as farm hands. After all, we are not landowners. We realise the importance of education,"" her uncle asserted. The praise isn't limited to the family as the girl is seen as a beacon of resilience for countless others who falter when faced with far lesser challenges.The principal of her grant-in-aid school is among a growing list of those applauding her fortitude - just as the Jan 26 audience did. ""She has been a bright student who never missed classes. It's inspirational, to say the least, the way she is navigating these challenging times with courage and resilience,"" the principal told TOI.","The 15-year-old was allegedly raped by her teacher days after winning applause for her beti bachao, beti padhao speech.

Gujarat gynaec hospital videos shared on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarat-gynaec-hospital-videos-shared-on-social-media/articleshow/118341292.cms,"RAJKOT/AHMEDABAD: In a serious breach of women's privacy , CCTV videos from a private hospital in Rajkot showing women undergoing gynecological check-ups and medical treatment were circulated on social media, prompting the police to lodge an offence.The Ahmedabad cybercrime branch, which was entrusted the probe along with its Rajkot counterparts, revealed that videos of multiple women were uploaded to YouTube and shared on Telegram channels. The footage was traced back to a CCTV camera installed in the hospital's outdoor patient department (OPD).The YouTube channel, identified as 'Megha MBBS,' not only hosted the videos but also included Telegram links in the comments section, allowing viewers to access additional content. Several subscription offers to view other such explicit content were also made in the links. Over the past month, these videos have reportedly garnered more than five lakh views.The hospital, located in a commercial complex near Raiya Crossroads in Rajkot, came under scrutiny after the breach came to light on Monday.Rajkot's deputy commissioner of crime (DCP) Dr. Parthrajsinh Gohil confirmed that a team had visited the hospital to gather more details. Cybercrime team found that the videos were first shared on Telegram in Sept 2024 and later uploaded to YouTube on Jan 6, 2025. One particularly disturbing clip showed a woman being administered an injection.Assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Ahmedabad cybercrime, Hardik Makadia, said, ""The circulation of such videos is a grave violation of privacy. A case has been registered under sections 66E and 67 of the Information Technology Act, addressing privacy violations and the publication of obscene material online,"" he said.Police are working to identify and apprehend those responsible for the breach. Efforts are also being made to remove the footage from all platforms to protect the victims' privacy.State health minister and government spokesman Rushikesh Patel said that he had been informed about the video leaks through media reports. He confirmed that the Ahmedabad Cybercrime Branch had already registered a case and that necessary action would follow once the investigation concludes.""There are technical aspects to consider, including whether the hospital's CCTV system was hacked. The hospital's version of events will also be recorded. The government will decide on further action after a thorough investigation,"" Patel said.The minister added that government hospitals do not install CCTVs in patient treatment areas to ensure privacy and that private hospitals have been instructed to adhere to similar guidelines in the past.","Cctv videos from a private hospital in rajkot showed women undergoing gynecological check-ups and medical treatment.

The petition argues that EWS candidates should have parity with candidates of other reserved classes and should not be clubbed with general category candidates in terms of eligibility criteria. Candidates from reserved classes, like SC/ST/OBC/physically disabled, get five years' relaxation in upper age limit and nine attempts.The counsel for Centre and UPSC sought time to file objections to the petition, but HC said: ""Since the last date to fill up forms is approaching, we deem it appropriate to permit the petitioner to apply for the same. UPSC is directed to accept the application of the petitioner as well as all other similarly situated candidates for CSE-2025 without reference to the existing qualification or age, but subject to compliance of other conditions. The applications will be accepted on the aforesaid condition up to seven days from today (Feb 14) and subject to further orders of this court.""""However, appointment orders of such candidates... shall not be issued without leave of this court,"" HC said.

"Accused has right to speedy trial, can get bail if it is delayed, says SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/accused-has-right-to-speedy-trial-can-get-bail-if-it-is-delayed-says-sc/articleshow/118340926.cms,"NEW DELHI: Noting that an accused has a fundamental right to speedy trial, irrespective of the seriousness of his offence, Supreme Court has held that keeping an undertrial prisoner in jail for six to seven years without verdict amounted to violation of his rights and bail could be granted to him. It released an accused, who is being prosecuted under anti-terror law UAPA, on bail as he had been in custody for the last five years.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan also questioned the tendency of prosecuting agencies to examine a large number of witnesses during trial which resulted in delay. It said the time has come to consider the issue of delay and bail in its true and proper perspective to also protect the interest of an accused who suffers a lot and is not even compensated financially if acquitted after long incarceration.""We may sound as if laying some guidelines, but time has come to consider this issue of delay and bail in its true and proper perspective. If an accused is to get a final verdict after incarceration of six to seven years in jail as an undertrial prisoner, then, definitely, it could be said that his right to have a speedy trial under Article 21 of the Constitution has been infringed,"" the bench said.It said, ""The stress of long trials on accused persons - who remain innocent until proven guilty - can also be significant. Accused persons are not financially compensated for what might be a lengthy period of pretrial incarceration. They may have lost a job or accommodation, experienced damage to personal relationships and spent a considerable amount of money on legal fees. If an accused person is found not guilty, they have likely endured many months of being stigmatised and perhaps even ostracised in their community and will have to rebuild their lives with their own resources.""In this case, the accused was arrested in March 2020 in Chhattisgarh while carrying articles generally used in naxalite activities - walkie talkie, LED lense etc. The prosecution intended to examine as many as 100 witnesses in the case but only 42 have been examined in five years.Though the bench said the court ordinarily should not exercise its discretion for the purpose of grant of bail in serious offences, it, however, stated that bail could be granted in view of violation of rights of an accused due to inordinate delay.""It's been now five years that he is in judicial custody. The learned counsel appearing for the state has no idea as regards the time likely to be consumed to complete the recording of the oral evidence. We are left with no other option but to order release of the appellant on bail,"" the bench said.","Supreme court held that keeping an undertrial prisoner in jail for six to seven years without verdict amounted to violation of his rights.

HC, in March last year, admitted the CBI appeal, saying there were some contradictions in the trial court judgment that required ""deeper examination"".In the CBI case, Raja, Kanimozhi, and 15 others were tried under provisions of the IPC and Prevention of Corruption Act for offences of criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery, using as genuine fake documents, abusing official position, criminal misconduct by a public servant, and taking bribes.","Cbi has submitted before delhi high court that its appeal against acquittal of former telecom minister a raja and 16 others is ""ripe for hearing"" a special cbi court had on dec 21, 2017, acquitted former upa-era telecom minister raja, now an mp from nilgiris.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118340885,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1260511,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

A US military aircraft landed at Amritsar airport on Saturday night, carrying 116 Indian migrants who had been deported from the United States. Among them was Daljit Singh, who had left his village in Punjab last year with hopes of a better future. Instead, he returned in shackles, his hands cuffed and legs chained throughout the journey.""Our legs were chained and hands were also cuffed throughout the journey. There were three women and three children on board who were not cuffed,"" Daljit told news agency PTI upon arrival. His experience reflects the harsh reality of illegal migration , where many fall prey to fraudulent travel agents and endure gruelling journeys, only to be deported back home.Among the deportees, over 60 were from Punjab, 33 from Haryana, eight from Gujarat, two each from Uttar Pradesh, Goa, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan, and one each from Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.Daljit recounted how he was lured by a travel agent in 2022, who promised to take him to the US legally in exchange for Rs 65 lakh. To secure the deal, he handed over an advance agreement for an acre of his land. His journey began in November 2022, when he was first sent to Dubai. After spending nearly 18 months there, he returned to India, only to be sent to South Africa for four-and-a-half months.From there, he was taken to Brazil on August 26 last year and embarked on a treacherous route through multiple countries. The journey involved walking through dense forests, crossing rivers, and surviving on minimal food. Eventually, he reached Mexico, where he was forced to stay for a month while his travel agent coerced his wife into signing over his land. Finally, he crossed into the US on January 27, only to be caught and detained by US Border Patrol. ""I was given only a bottle of water, a packet of chips, and an apple daily,"" he told PTI.Sourav, a 20-year-old from Punjab's Ferozepur district, also shared his harrowing experience. His family spent Rs 45-46 lakh to send him to the US, selling farmland and borrowing money from relatives. ""We were kept in a camp (detention centre) for 18 days,"" he said. ""A day before our deportation, we were told that we would be shifted to another camp. When we boarded the plane, they said we were being taken to India.""Sourav had travelled through Amsterdam, Panama, and Mexico before attempting to cross the border on January 27. ""Our mobile phones were confiscated, and we had no contact with our families. Our hands and legs were tied. We cooperated with the US authorities, but no one heard our appeals.""Harjit Singh, from Gurdaspur district, was deported alongside his cousin.

Harjit was caught while crossing the border on January 27 and detained for 18 days before being deported on February 13.Sahil Preet Singh’s parents, from Kapurthala district, spent Rs 40-45 lakh, selling their farmland and gold to fund his journey.

NEW DELHI: Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Monday responded to the death of a Nepali student at KIIT University in Odisha, saying that his government has dispatched two officers from the Nepalese Embassy in New Delhi to counsel affected students.“Our Embassy in New Delhi has dispatched two officers to counsel Nepali students affected in Odisha. Additionally, arrangements have been made to ensure they have the option to either remain in their hostel or return home, based on their preference,” he said.The Embassy of India in Kathmandu also issued a statement expressing deep sorrow over the student's death. Offering condolences to the family, the Embassy confirmed it has been in contact with both KIIT authorities and the Odisha State Government. Local authorities have already initiated an investigation into the incident, which is being treated as a case of suspected suicide.The incident involved the alleged suicide of Prakriti Lamsal , a third-year B-Tech student from Nepal, inside her hostel room at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT). Following the discovery of her body on Sunday, tensions escalated on campus, with Nepali students staging protests demanding justice.Her cousin filed a complaint at the Infocity police station, alleging that she took her own life due to blackmail by another student. Bhubaneswar DCP Pinak Mishra confirmed that a case has been registered on charges of abetment to suicide, and the accused student is in police custody. “We have seized the mobile phone, laptop, and other gadgets of the deceased woman. A scientific investigation is underway,” he stated, urging students to maintain peace.In response to the growing unrest, KIIT authorities issued a notice ordering all Nepali students to vacate the campus immediately. “The institute was closed sine die for all international students from Nepal, and they are directed to vacate the university campus immediately today on 17th February,” the notice read.Students were seen leaving hostels in large numbers, with reports emerging that they were given little time to prepare. Some claimed they had no clear travel arrangements or food. “We were protesting for the girl, and suddenly we were asked to vacate. We don’t know what their intentions are, but we were forcibly made to leave. I don’t have a train ticket or money,” Rajan Gupta, a Nepali student, told reporters.KIIT Registrar Prof. Jnyana Ranjan Mohanty stated that the decision to ask Nepali students to leave was made in response to their protests. “Following the incident, a few Nepali students protested. The university held discussions with them, and the situation was resolved. They accepted the decision and left,” he told ANI.KIIT University issued a statement acknowledging the incident and said the police acted swiftly. “Immediately after the incident, police investigated the matter and apprehended the culprit. The administration has taken all-out efforts to restore normalcy on campus and in the hostels to resume academic activities,” it said. The university also urged Nepali students who had left to return and resume their studies.","Nepal's prime minister kp sharma oli responded to the death of a nepali student at kiit university in odisha.

Fresh Tamil Nadu-Centre row erupts over three-language policy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fresh-tamil-nadu-centre-row-erupts-over-three-language-policy/articleshow/118339038.cms,"NEW DELHI: Responding to Tamil Nadu deputy chief minister Udhayanidhi Stalin 's accusation once again that the BJP-led Union govt is attempting to impose Hindi on the state, Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan criticised the DMK govt for ""doing politics"" over the issue while reiterating Centre's commitment to implementing the National Education Policy 2020 .The latest row erupted after Pradhan, speaking in Varanasi on Feb 15, asserted that Tamil Nadu must come to terms with the Indian Constitution and accept the three-language formula, calling it the rule of law.Arguing that the NEP-2020 provides a level playing field for students nationwide, Pradhan said, ""To create competition among students, to create a common platform, we must embrace multi-lingual education. The NEP emphasises the mother tongue. Tamil is one of the oldest languages of our civilization. But what is wrong if a student in Tamil Nadu learns multiple languages? There is no imposition of Hindi or any other language.""The political battle over the language policy has once again intensified in Tamil Nadu, with the DMK-led state govt opposing the Centre's three-language policy under NEP-2020. Tamil Nadu govt has been against the three-language formula, which has been a policy since 1968 and was reiterated in 1986. However, the state has never implemented it.The opposition to the three-language formula stems from Tamil Nadu's long standing resistance to purported Hindi imposition , a sentiment deeply rooted in the state's political history. The state witnessed strong anti-Hindi agitations in 1937 and later in the 1960s, which ultimately led to Tamil Nadu adopting the two-language policy.The state BJP dismissed the DMK's objections, calling them politically motivated. BJP Tamil Nadu vice president said, ""All private schools owned by many politicians, including the one owned by the first family of DMK, teach Hindi and other languages. They just want to do cheap politics. We condemn the CM for politicising this.""","Union education minister dharmendra pradhan criticised the dmk govt for ""doing politics"" over the issue.

He was unavailable for comment.Amid growing resentment against the twin orders, a fresh controversy broke Monday over minister of state for home Jawahar Singh Bedham purportedly saying in a viral video that many Urdu teachers in the state secured jobs with fake degrees. ""The previous (Congress) govt removed Sanskrit teachers and deployed Urdu teachers in their place.

In India, art isn't something you go looking for. It's everywhere. In the intricate carvings of temple pillars, the delicate embroidery on a grandmother's sari, the bold colours of a truck's painted bumper, the everyday rangoli at someone's doorstep.This deeply entrenched consciousness of art and aesthetics in the objects we use and the spaces we inhabit in daily Indian life made for enriching conversations at the launch of the Art of India 's (AOI) fourth edition at Mumbai's NCPA on Sunday where artists, collectors, and connoisseurs came together to celebrate the very idea that art isn't separate from life itself.""Aesthetics have been part of our civilization forever,"" said industrialist Ajay Piramal, tracing India's artistic roots back to the Vedas. ""It's in the way we dress, the way we design our homes, in our temples, and even in the way we celebrate. It's there in our music, dance, sculpture. The Samaveda talks about it. The first Raag Bhairavi is said to have come straight from the mouth of Lord Shiva. There are hundreds of objects dedicated solely to dressing up a woman-foot scrubbers, combs, intricately designed mirrors. Even in a simple Indian wedding, one sees the appreciation of art and beauty."" Yet, somewhere along the way, he feels we started looking outward for artistic inspiration instead of valuing our heritage. However, he sees hope in the govt's new education policy that includes aesthetic literacy as a key component.For author Shobhaa De, art has always been about connection. ""Coming from a middle-class Maharashtrian family, I've always felt that Mumbai lives with art,"" she said. ""We don't have to go to a museum to find it. Even something as simple as a rangoli made at home every morning is an act of artistic creation. It's how we pass down an awareness of aesthetics to the next generation.""De recounted her first modest brush with collecting her first piece of art. ""I couldn't afford an original so I bought a high-quality print of Amrita Sher-Gil's 'Three Girls' from Lalit Kala Akademi. It cost just a few hundred rupees, but it's been with me for over five decades. Now, my grandchildren look at it and that's how appreciation for art grows, by living with it.""Beyond the personal, Sabyasachi Mukherjee, director general of CSMVS museum, dwelled on how art shapes the soul of a city, too. ""At a recent museum reopening, Maharashtra chief minister (Devendra Fadnavis) said something that resonated - the greatness of a city isn't measured by its tall buildings or how many rich people live there but by its cultural heritage. That's what we need to understand and open up discussions on how cultural institutions can contribute.""Beyond the speeches, even the art showcased at the event curated with both thought and skill by Alka Pande kickstarted interesting conversations on sustainability, development and the need to give India's folk and tribal the pride of place it deserves in the Indian art pantheon. While masters like F N Souza, Arpana Caur and J Swaminathan got their due, AOI also cast the spotlight on some hidden gems like the dying art of kaavi, a mural art form found across the Konkan coast. For the show, artist Janardhan Rao Havanje had transported the geometric and floral art form usually found on limestone walls to a canvas. His kaavi Krishna with earthy reds and indigo highlighted the beauty of the art form. ""Besides painting, I also document and restore kaavi art. As buildings are demolished, there are very few sites that remain. So the attempt is to persuade people to preserve and restore them,"" says the Udupi-based artist who is deeply passionate about the cause. Lalitha Krishnan, potter and debutante sculptor from Ranikhet, is equally committed to a different cause - that of capturing humanity's impact on the environment. ""My sculpture of the Himalayan grey langur is inspired by the langurs that come to my garden to feed on my fruit trees. Their numbers are dwindling every day,"" says Krishnan. From Krishnan's leaping langurs to Bandana Jain's eco-friendly horses made with recycled cardboard, Indian artists are clearly keen to inspire change through art.As artist Nabibakhsh Mansoori whose oil on canvas 'When The Seasons Change' is on display at AOI, put it, ""Politics divides people but art brings them together. This space compels society to think differently,"" said Mansoori, who sees art as more than just expression but a way to centre oneself. ""The more creative minds come together, and the more people appreciate art, the calmer their minds will be. It's a form of meditation.""","Aesthetics have been part of our civilization forever, says industrialist ajay piramal.

They submitted that they came from Bangladesh in 2010 and settled in East Burdwan. They said they were arrested 13 months ago and sent to judicial custody.Pointing to the recent deportations from the US to India, Justice Basak said, ""Don't you see that people who illegally moved to the US are being returned to India? I would ask you to provide the documents of citizenship to the court. I can grant you bail only then.""Counsel for the petitioners submitted that his clients obtained genuine Aadhar cards, voter cards and ration cards from appropriate authorities.

The HC was taken aback by the submission.""Those who have come from Bangladesh to India do have Aadhar, voter and ration cards of India. I don't know if you are filing income tax returns, but many Bangladeshis do so after coming to India. Those who have come to India faking Bangladeshi passports have all such documents,"" Justice Basak said.Counsel for the petitioners submitted that documents of citizenship were not being given to the couple. Claiming that the petitioners were genuine Indian citizens, the counsel opposed the charge that the petitioners entered India with fake passports.The counsel pleaded that as the petitioners were Hindus and entered India in 2010 before Dec 31, 2014-the deadline set under the Citizenship Amendment Act-the petitioners would not come under the provisions of the Foreigners Act.The division bench, however, didn't buy the argument and turned down the bail applications of the petitioners.","Dulal sil and his wife, swapna sil, moved the high court praying for bail.
