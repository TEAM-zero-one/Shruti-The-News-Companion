'Without Mamata di …': Mani Shankar Aiyar's advise to Rahul Gandhi on INDIA bloc leadership,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/without-mamata-di-mani-shankar-aiyars-advise-to-rahul-gandhi-on-india-bloc-leadership/articleshow/128697359.cms,"NEW DELHI: Days after publicly hoping for Pinarayi Vijayan ’s victory in the upcoming Kerala elections, veteran Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar claimed West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is central to the survival of the opposition INDIA bloc.While talking to news agency IANS, Aiyar suggested that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi should allow leaders of smaller parties to steer the INDIA bloc.""Without Mamata di, the ‘I’, ‘N’, ‘D’, ‘I’, ‘A’ of the INDIA alliance will all be gone. Because Mamata Banerjee is the leader of this alliance,"" Aiyar said.""I hope that instead of trying to remain in this position, which belongs to smaller parties — be it MK Stalin, Mamata Didi, Akhilesh Yadav, Tejashwi Yadav, or someone else — Rahul Gandhi should let them handle it,"" he added.Recalling his early political association with Mamata Banerjee, Aiyar said he briefly joined the Trinamool Congress in 1997 and served as its first National Secretary but left within weeks, concluding that the party was rooted in Bengali identity.Responding to whether he is still in Congress, Aiyar said he still considers himself in the party but suggested possible disciplinary action against him.""I consider myself to be in Congress, but it seems they may have decided to expel me.However, I have not received any formal letter,"" Aiyar said.He added that although reports suggested he had been expelled, he had received no official communication.""If you want the Congress’ view, ask a Congressman,"" Aiyar remarked, while also saying that he believed many within the Congress support Mamata Banerjee.Earlier, Aiyar praised the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government in Kerala, led by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.Things escalated rapidly when Aiyar, speaking to ANI, dismissed the authority of the current Congress leadership and declared: ""I am a Gandhian, I am a Nehruvian, I am a Rajivian, but I am not a Rahulian.""Invoking BR Ambedkar’s description of dissent as being ""a part but apart,"" Aiyar positioned himself as an ideological insider with the right to rebel. The tone, however, soon turned confrontational.Targeting Congress spokesperson **Pawan Khera**, Aiyar said: ""I have absolutely no respect and complete contempt for Pawan Khera… He is not a spokesperson, he is a parrot.""Within hours, Congress distanced itself from the remarks and publicly severed any association with Aiyar.Khera issued a statement on X distancing the party from Aiyar’s comments: ""Mr Mani Shankar Aiyar has had no connection whatsoever with the Congress for the past few years. He speaks and writes purely in his personal capacity.""","Mani shankar aiyar claims west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee is central to the survival of the opposition india bloc. He suggested that congress leader rahul gandhi should allow leaders of smaller parties to steer the india bloc.

NMC proposes mandatory corpus fund for medical colleges; incomplete applications to be rejected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nmc-proposes-mandatory-corpus-fund-for-medical-colleges-incomplete-applications-to-be-rejected/articleshow/128696305.cms,".

NEW DELHI: In a bid to tighten the noose on regulatory compliance in medical education, the National Medical Commission (NMC) has proposed making a dedicated corpus fund mandatory for new and recently operational medical colleges, while warning that incomplete applications will be rejected outright.Under draft amendments issued this week to the 2023 regulations governing establishment and expansion of medical institutions, any entity seeking to open a new medical college will have to submit an undertaking confirming that it will maintain a dedicated corpus fund exclusively for the functioning of the institution. The amount will be determined later by the Medical Assessment and Rating Board (MARB) and may be revised from time to time. The provision also refers to already operational colleges.Dr MK Ramesh, president of the MARB told TOI that the earlier regulation had mentioned a corpus fund but did not specify any amount, making it difficult to enforce. Instead of deleting the clause, the Commission chose to retain it by seeking an undertaking from colleges, with the exact amount to be fixed after due deliberation. While the wording includes existing institutions, the intent is largely to ensure financial safeguards for new and recently opened colleges.Once decided, the corpus amount will be uniform.The draft also marks a clear shift toward stricter scrutiny of applications. It clarifies that under the NMC Act, a “scheme” is valid only when an application is complete with all mandatory documents. In the past, some applicants submitted incomplete proposals and later sought additional time — or court intervention — to furnish missing documents. The amendment aims to end that practice by stating that incomplete applications will be rejected at the outset, without further opportunity.Mandatory documents include a valid Essentiality Certificate from the concerned state or Union Territory government, a valid Consent of Affiliation from a recognised university, and a solvency certificate issued by a chartered accountant within 90 days prior to the application deadline.The regulator has also empowered itself to withhold processing or reject applications for new schemes or seat increases for specific academic years. In a strong compliance warning, the draft states that any attempt to pressurize MARB or the NMC through individuals or agencies could lead to immediate halt or rejection of the application.India has witnessed rapid expansion in medical colleges and seats over the past decade. While the growth has improved access to medical education, concerns about infrastructure gaps, faculty shortages and financial sustainability have persisted. By mandating a corpus fund and eliminating room for incomplete proposals, the NMC appears to be signalling that future expansion must be backed by financial preparedness and full regulatory compliance.The draft amendments have been opened for public consultation for 30 days, after which the Commission will decide on finalising the revised rules.",The national medical commission (nmc) has proposed making a dedicated corpus fund mandatory for new and recently operational medical colleges. The amount will be determined later by the medical assessment and rating board. The draft also marks a clear shift toward stricter scrutiny of applications.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128696372,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-931333,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

GURGAON: Eleven Class 10 students missed their CBSE board maths paper on Tuesday after their school in Sector 9 failed to get them admit cards following a dispute over affiliation, sparking nightlong protests by parents and a police complaint.Parents alleged that Educrest International School kept delaying the admit cards despite taking full fees in advance, leaving families panicked and students uncertain about whether they would be allowed to write the remaining papers. Out of a batch of 25, only 14 students received hall tickets.The rest reached the test centre without an admit card, only to be turned back despite months of preparation.The school, parents said, had a CBSE affiliation only till Class 8, but had got students registered for board exams through other institutions.

NEW DELHI: Security agencies in the capital have heightened security following intelligence reports suggesting a possible terror plan aimed at crowded religious and heritage sites.According to inputs, the Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba is reportedly planning IED attacks in major cities across India, including a temple in Chandni Chowk, as retaliation for an attack on a mosque in Islamabad on Feb 6.The alert comes three months after a blast near the same temple in the vicinity of Red Fort led to 15 deaths. Deployment of forces has been increased to strengthen surveillance and prevent any untoward incidents. Security forces have stepped up patrolling in key areas where religious and historical sites are located.Para-military forces have been deployed in large numbers to maintain continuous surveillance, particularly focusing on temple premises, to deter any potential threat.Vehicles entering Delhi are being thoroughly inspected, and parked vehicles — including those left unattended — are also being carefully checked.At the same time, security personnel are continuously monitoring real-time CCTV feeds across the city to detect any unusual movement or suspicious activity.Police are also holding regular coordination meetings with market welfare associations and resident welfare associations, along with shopkeepers, vendors, and other local stakeholders.In addition, comprehensive verification drives are currently under way at hotels, guesthouses, cyber cafes, shopping malls, cinemas, SIM card dealers, and chemical shops.

A temple in Chandni Chowk was one of the targets with its images being found in the suspects' devices. The car bomb blast reported last Nov had happened near this temple located near the Red Fort.The operation kicked off after a series of provocative posters were pasted at metro stations. The poster incident in Delhi was revealed to be a calculated act of psychological warfare and a test of the module's mobility. On Feb 8, CISF had filed a complaint with the police that unknown individuals had affixed pro-Pakistan and pro-terror posters at the Janpath and other Metro stations, a major security breach before the AI summit.The posters eulogised slain terrorist Burhan Wani and had slogans like “India stop genocide & Free Kashmir”, while others contained Urdu slogans which, when translated, stated “Hum Pakistani Hain, Pakistan Hamara Hai” (We are Pakistani, Pakistan is ours) and celebrated “Kashmir Solidarity Day"".A case was registered and investigation was transferred to the Special Cell.

Rajaji statue to replace Lutyens' at Prez house that he designed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rajaji-statue-to-replace-lutyens-at-prez-house-that-he-designed/articleshow/128690911.cms,"PM Modi heaps praise on Jayalalithaa

NEW DELHI: Architect of New Delhi Edwin Lutyens' legacy in independent India came to symbolise a rarefied milieu inhabited by those with an enviable mix of power, pedigree and influence. To the critics, govts came and went but the Lutyens' privileged elite was permanent.Since coming to office in 2014, PM Modi, who has been unabashed in his disdain for what he has at times scorned as 'Lutyens' gang' or 'Lutyens' jamaat', has been chipping away at its vestiges, spotlighted by renaming of roads and powerful addresses and by putting Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's statue on the pedestal meant for the British emperor, and importance accorded to Hindi and other Indian languages and bringing in names rooted in Indian heritage and legacy in place of British-era monikers. Now, Lutyens' own statue is set to be removed from his signature construction - Rashtrapati Bhavan.In his monthly 'Mann Ki Baat' broadcast, Modi announced that a statue of C Rajagopalachari, a freedom fighter who became the first and only Indian governor general after independence before the post was scrapped in the new republic in 1950, will replace that of Lutyens in Rashtrapati Bhawan on Monday.""His (Rajagopalachari) conduct, self-restraint, and independent thinking in public life inspire us even today.Unfortunately, even after independence, statues of British administrators were allowed to remain in Rashtrapati Bhavan, but those of the nation's greatest sons were denied space,"" he said.The PM said it is continuation of his push to rid the country of slave mentality - a call he had given from Red Fort - and accord primacy to India's own legacy and traditions. 'Rajaji Utsav' will be celebrated at Rashtrapati Bhavan and the statue will be inaugurated at its Central Courtyard, he said, lauding Rajagopalachari - the close associate of Mahatma Gandhi and former CM of the erstwhile Madras State - as someone who saw power not as a position but as a service.Speaking on Lutyens, architect and town planner A K Jain said it was only after the announcement in 1911 about the change of capital to Delhi that the idea of a planned 'New Delhi' came in a city growing in a haphazard manner.In her book 'Connaught Place and the Making of New Delhi', historian Swapna Liddle writes Lutyens was dismissive of Indian architectural styles, with Jain, who also authored Lutyens' Delhi, insisting that the credit for the city cannot go to one person, as he recalled the contribution of Maharaja of Jaipur, who gave land and money, and Indian engineers.Jain said Mahatma Gandhi wanted the erstwhile Viceregal Lodge, now the Rashtrapati Bhavan, to be converted into a hospital or an educational institution.In his remarks, Modi also heaped praise on another noted political figure of poll-bound Tamil Nadu - the late AIADMK leader and CM J Jayalalithaa. He recalled her efforts for good governance, women empowerment and his personal equation with her since he was chief minister of Gujarat. She had a special bond with women, he said.""This is also because she made many commendable efforts in govt for the welfare of mothers, sisters, and daughters. She also took concrete steps to maintain law and order in the state. The spirit of patriotism was deeply embedded within her. She was also deeply proud of India's cultural heritage,"" he said of Jayalalithaa, an early votary of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, when even most regional satraps shunned the Hindutva plank.PM recalled that she attended two of his swearing-in ceremonies as CM in Gujarat, in 2002 and 2012, and invited him to Chennai for lunch on Pongal.

The TOI can't vouch for the veracity of the video.In the video, the accused woman can be heard calling the women “momo” and asking, “Rs 500 mei massage parlour mei kaam karne waali dhandhewali (You work at massage parlours as sex workers for Rs 500). Are you sitting here to do business? Have you opened a massage parlour at home?”The women had called an electrician to install an air conditioner in their fourth-floor flat on February 20 around 3.30 pm. Dust and debris from the drilling work fell to the floor below, prompting objections from their neighbours, Harsh Singh and his wife Ruby Jain, reported PTI.What began as a disagreement soon escalated into verbal abuse and racially charged remarks targeting the northeastern community.The accused also allegedly made offensive remarks, calling the women “gutter-chaap”, telling them to “go and sell momos” and saying “northeast people are shit.”The man, Harsh Singh, was also heard using derogatory language.At one point, the accused woman claimed social and economic superiority, saying, “Teri aukaat nahi hai... custom officer ka beta hai woh... politician ka beta hai (You have no standards. He is the son of a custom officer...a politician's son).”A police officer was present during the altercation and is seen in the video attempting to calm the situation. The women confronted the couple in the footage, one of them saying, “Everyone heard what you said about my image. You made false allegations that I drink alcohol. Go check my room if you find any bottles there.”The women filed a complaint at the Malviya Nagar police station. An FIR has been registered under BNS sections 79 (word intended to insult a woman’s modesty), 351(2) (criminal intimidation), 3(5) (common intention), and 196 (promoting enmity on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc.) against the couple. Section 196 is non-bailable and cognizable. No arrests have been made so far, according to PTI.“No physical injuries were reported. However, the complainants have alleged mental harassment and humiliation,” a senior police officer said. The women have demanded a formal apology, stating that the remarks targeted the dignity of the northeastern community.The situation reportedly worsened when a building broker allegedly informed the women that they would have to vacate the flat within two months due to planned repair work. The complainants have expressed apprehension about their safety and future accommodation.Police said further investigation into the matter is underway.","Three women from arunachal pradesh allege they were subjected to racial slurs, humiliation, and intimidation by their neighbours in south delhi.

Both of them were arrested, and they revealed that anti-India posters were put up at many places in Delhi, the posters that echoed terrorists, were put up by these two. Later, it was found out through interrogation and investigation that the direction to them was being given by Shabbir Ahmed Lone, from Bangladesh. ""Police sources said that four of the eight accused had earlier come to Delhi and pasted ""Free Kashmir"" and other provocative posters at a metro station during the AI Summit before returning to Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.Investigations revealed that the module was allegedly directed by Shabbir Ahmed Lone, a resident of Ganderbal in Kashmir, currently based in Bangladesh.""In 2007, Shabbir Ahmed Lone was arrested, and AK-47, grenades were found on him, and he had come for 'fidayeen' to kill a senior political leader...He remained in jail for many years and was released in 2019.

NEW DELHI: At a high-level meeting of all senior-level officers of Enforcement Directorate in Guwahati last week, which was chaired by director Rahul Navin, all zonal offices were asked to expedite the filing of chargesheets so that the central agency can achieve its target of filing 500 prosecution complaints (chargesheets) in this financial year, which will come to a close in a little over a month's time.Senior officials from other central agencies such as Narcotics Control Bureau, Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) and from Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India were called to make presentations on the trends in financial crimes, cases of digital arrest, organised online frauds and cross-border anti-India activities.As some officers highlighted non-cooperation from some state govts, ED director Rahul Navin asked his zonal heads to enhance use of intelligence platforms such as Natgrid and Finnet, have greater recourse to international cooperation mechanisms and make efforts to diversify case typologies in line with emerging risks.Officers were advised to coordinate with Customs and other agencies concerned to detect illicit capital outflows disguised as legitimate trade transactions, to identify proceeds of crime related to predicate offences.Guwahati was also chosen as the venue for ED's quarterly conference given the increasing anti-India activities from neighbouring Myanmar and Bangladesh.In the last two to three years, the directorate has significantly expanded its footprint in the North-East, opening six new offices and establishing a presence in almost all states of the region, which has witnessed rising cases of cybercrime and drug trafficking.In Sept last year, CBI conducted its quarterly conference in Srinagar.According to the officer, the intent behind organising the high-level meet there was ""to restore confidence in the security environment of the Union territory after the unfortunate terrorist attack at Pahalgam a few months earlier"". It was done to show that J&K remains a safe, vibrant and forward-looking venue for national and international level deliberations, the officer added.",All zonal offices were asked to expedite the filing of chargesheets.

"For some Gujarat groups, parental consent for marriage written in ‘constitution’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-some-gujarat-groups-parental-consent-for-marriage-written-in-constitution/articleshow/128631922.cms,"A Patidar community meeting last month in Mehsana. Leader of a Patidar group said they want strict laws against ‘sham marriages’

'Violate ban, face boycott'

Notice

'Parents should have say'

'Love marriage no crime'

Gujarat govt’s proposal that couples must inform their parents before tying the knot is yet to become law, but ‘or - ders’ to that effect are al - ready in force in parts of Gujarat, where some villages and communities have come out with detailed ‘codes’ intended to govern how their members marry.The amendments proposed in the state assembly on Friday reflect de - mands and actions being pushed on the ground, with scattered village reso - lutions hardening into communitylevel ‘constitutions’ — resolutions and declarations that threaten couples who marry for love with boycott, ostracism, and exclusion from public life.From gram sabhas in Kheda district to caste organisations of Patidars and Thakors, the consen - sus driving such declarations is that marriage without parental consent threatens tradition, destabilises so - cial order and endangers women.The gram sabha in Nand village in Mahudha taluka recently passed a res - olution imposing total social boycott on couples who marry despite opposi - tion from their families. Such couples are barred from community facilities, religious gatherings and social func - tions. The resolution also caps wed - ding and funeral expenses, prohibits DJs and “objectionable songs”, and imposes fines for violations.Bharat Solanki, the village sar - panch, said rising cases of marriage disputes had led to the decision. “We are a village of 5,000, mostly Thakors and Darbars. There have been sagotra (intra-clan) marriages, which are not permissible. When a couple elopes, it puts parents in an embarrassing po - sition. As these incidents have been rising, we decided to declare a ban on such marriages. Violate the ban, and you face boycott. ”The rules, Solanki insisted, spare no one. All communities in the vil - lage — including OBC and SC fami - lies, which form a minority — are required to comply. “The rules are for everyone. We are not targeting one single group. Violators pay Rs 21,000 fine and are excluded from village gatherings,” he said.Similar ‘rules’ are surfacing else - where, signalling a broader social churn. Village elders argue that couples who elope — their union is known locally as ‘bhagedu lagan’ — disrupt social harmony and bring dishonour to their families.Geni Thakor, Congress MP from Banaskantha who spearheaded the Thakor community’s campaign against such unions, said “the deci - sion was taken because (they) kept seeing fraudulent marriages"".“A girl marrying outside her com - munity weakens its social fabric. There have been instances where women are deceived by men, subject - ed to abuse and, in some cases, driven to suicide. Our aim is to protect our daughters,” said Thakor, who also cit - ed demographic factors, saying “the Patidar sex ratio is collapsing”.Following the proposed amend -ments, Thakor said she “was the first to raise the issue of ‘bhagedu lagan’ when the ‘love jihad’ bill (Gujarat Free - dom of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2021) was tabled in the assembly”. She insisted that “99% of love marriages fail and bring misery to the girl”. Asked about the basis for her claim, she said, “I have found this in villages; it might not be the case in big cities.”Among Patidars, opposition to such self-choice marriages has simmered for years. Lalji Patel, who heads the Sardar Patel Group (SPG), said the movement crystallised around paren tal anguish.“During Covid, parents came to us, begging us to rescue daughters trapped in sham marriages,” Patel said. “That is why we initiated these measures.” He said the SPG has been demand - ing that the legal age of marriage for women be raised from 18 to 21 even as he acknowledged that the Constitution allows adults to marry by choice. “But society matters. Parents are every - thing. They should have a say.”One pamphlet distributed by the Patidar Sena in Mehsana went beyond parental consent to call for sweeping changes, including par - ents’ signatures on marriage regis - tration for those aged 30 or younger. It also wanted court marriages to be restricted to the bride’s local juris - diction, 40 to be the minimum age of witnesses, and couples who marry by choice after 30 to deposit Rs 10 lakh in their parents’ accounts and forfeit any claim to family property.“These demands are born from the pain parents have gone through,” said Satish Patel, leader of the Mehsana Patidar Sena. Asked about the proposed rules, he said they were “not fully satisfied” as they also wanted “only blood relatives of girls to be signatories in the marriage registration as that ensures both parents and relatives bear full accountability for every such union”.Community leaders backing these demands insist they are not against people choosing whom they want to marry, but against secrecy and deception. “If a couple wants to marry and the parents agree, we have no objection,"" Lalji Patel said. “But parents must be involved. They’re the ones who will always shield their daughters.” He, too, said the latest proposal falls short of their demands.“The govt speaks of merely ‘informing’ parents, as though a notification is sufficient. We have demanded that parents’ consent be made mandatory.”Legal experts warn that such meas - ures strike at the core of constitu - tional freedoms but those who fall foul of such diktats say that they have to face serious difficulties in their day-to-day lives.A Dalit man from northern Gujarat who married a woman from the Darbar community in 2015 — Darbars are placed higher in the social hierarchy—said they have had to change their residence at least 50 times and stay off social media to avoid being traced. Both hold postgraduate de - grees but cannot find stable work.“We’ve not been able to work at one place. We are dependent on daily wages even though we both hold PG degrees,” the man said. “We took up jobs with NGOs, but my wife’s family members or relatives traced me there during fieldwork.”Kaushik Parmar, a lawyer from Mehsana who works with intercaste couples, slammed the proposed changes in the marriage registration rules, saying that “love marriage is not the enemy of society; it is the right of a free citizen”. “Every attempt to curb it weakens the Constitution and strengthens caste hierarchies. If we truly want a progressive, equal, and just society, we must see love marriage not as a crime but as an instrument of social change. These rules amount to the murder of democracy,” he said.",Gujarat govt’s proposal that couples must inform their parents before tying the knot is yet to become law.

NEW DELHI: Around 1.2 lakh additional seats in courses on new-age emerging sectors are proposed to be added in the 1,000 industrial training institutes (ITIs) that are being upgraded under the newly launched PM SETU (Prime Minister's Skilling and Employability Transformation through Upgraded ITIs) .These additional seats will cover over 50 new courses, which are slated to be introduced in the coming years, having special emphasis on emerging sectors such as AI, solar and renewables, semiconductors, electric vehicles, advanced manufacturing and automation among others, said sources.""This additional capacity is expected to equip youth with job ready skills and make training more practical, industry aligned and closely linked to employment. This will be an important step towards expanding the scale of skill training for these new sectors,"" an official told TOI.The proposal assumes significance as estimates show that there are about 2.3 million seats in nearly 15,000 ITIs across the country, with institutions often finding it difficult to fill them as students cite redundant courses, non-availability of instructors and inadequate infrastructure.Last year, the directorate general of training (DGT), which is the apex body under the skill ministry to develop vocational education de-affiliated nearly 4.5 lakh seats in nearly 6,000 ITIs.Under the scheme, ITI clusters have been identified across 32 states and UTs, with 26 of them setting up a steering committee, indicating that governance and oversight mechanisms are being put in place.""States are strengthening institutional frameworks and financial processes, while a few have already begun taking concrete steps to roll out the scheme on the ground,"" the official added.Announced in Union Budget 2024-25, the PM SETU scheme with an outlay of Rs 60,000 crore aimed at upgrading 1,000 govt-run ITIs in a hub and spoke model with industry participation in the next five years. Of Rs 3,000 crore allotted in FY26, the skill ministry spent Rs 356 crore, although funding fiscal doubled to Rs 6,141 crore.","Around 1.2 lakh additional seats in courses on new-age emerging sectors are proposed to be added in the 1,000 industrial training institutes.

Earlier in the day, the opposition demanded a white paper on such past agreements.After the opposition once again boycotted the customary tea party on the eve of the budget session, Fadnavis told reporters at the state guest house, Sahyadri, that 13 bills will be introduced during the one-month session. He said two bills are pending from the previous session and all of them will be passed. ""We shall give sufficient time for discussions,"" he said.He said the death of deputy CM Ajit Pawar meant it had fallen upon him to present the budget.

This is being discussed all over the country,"" said Congress MLA Vijay Wadettiwar.The CM pointed to NCP (SP)'s absence at the opposition's press conference, a six-page letter from the opposition being signed by a former MLA of the Sharad Pawar group and numerous grammatical errors in the letter that highlighted 18 issues.Sena (UBT) MLA Bhaskar Jadhav later said NCP (SP) netas arrived late for the meet owing to some communication gap. ""But we are all together as MVA,"" he asserted.While Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray pointed to the vacant posts of the leader of opposition in both Houses and asked why the Mahayuti govt was ""afraid"" of the post when it has the brute majority, Fadnavis said the decisions are to be taken by the assembly speaker and the legislative council chairman.Congress MLC Satej Patil demanded the resignation of FDA minister Narhari Zirwal from NCP over a bribery case involving a staffer attached to his office in Mantrayala. The CM said his name had not cropped up in the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) investigation. Acknowledging that the incident affects govt's image, Fadnavis said, ""We have zero tolerance towards corruption and that is why you see so many cases of action being taken. I have given clear instructions to ACB that if any such act of corruption is found in his office, then it must take action.""Thackeray also took a dig at Mahayuti, saying there is a growing rivalry among its ministers, likely referring to Fadnavis and deputy Eknath Shinde, on who govt's ""infra man"" is. He also slammed govt for giving just Rs 5 lakh compensation to the family of the Mulund Metro concrete parapet crash victim.Alleging that the new India-US trade deal ""will break the backs of farmers"", Wadettiwar pointed to the ongoing farmer suicide crisis in Maharashtra.Shinde urged the opposition to attend the budget session and not sit on the steps of Vidhan Bhavan and oppose govt.

“World Will See AI Differently”: PM Modi On AI Impact Summit In Mann Ki Baat

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday used the 131st episode of his monthly radio programme Mann Ki Baat to highlight the power of organ donation, sharing the story of a one-year-old from Kerala whose parents chose to donate her organs after her death.“There can be no greater sorrow than parents losing their child,” he said, referring to Aalin Sherin Abraham. He spoke of the unimaginable grief of losing a child so young, with her entire life ahead of her. Yet, amid that pain, her parents, Arun Abraham and Sherin, decided to donate their daughter’s organs — a decision he described as an act of immense courage and humanity.PM Modi said their choice reflected strength and compassion in the face of personal tragedy. Aalin, he noted, may no longer be among us, but her name has been added to the list of the country’s youngest organ donors.Turning to the broader picture, he said awareness about organ donation is steadily increasing in India, helping patients in need while strengthening medical research. He cited examples of transplant recipients who have gone on to lead active lives.Lakshmi Devi from Delhi completed a 14-kilometre trek to Kedarnath after a heart transplant.Her heart had been functioning at just 15 percent before she received a donor organ. Gaurang Banerjee from West Bengal has visited Nathula, 14,000 feet above sea level, twice after a lung transplant. In Rajasthan, Ramdev Singh from Sikar, who underwent a kidney transplant, is now active in sports.“These inspiring examples show how one noble decision can transform many lives,” the Prime Minister said, urging citizens to view organ donation as a collective responsibility.The appeal, framed through stories of loss and renewal, reinforced a simple message: a single decision can give someone else a second chance at life.",Pm narendra modi used the 131st episode of his monthly radio programme mann ki baat to highlight the power of organ donation.

Why Borah cut ties with Congress

‘Congress separating itself from Hindu society’

Congress marred with infights?

NEW DELHI: Is Congress faltering even before the run-up to the Assam assembly elections?Earlier on Sunday, the Congress in Assam faced its most significant setback yet as former state chief Bhupen Borah formally joined the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) at their headquarters, Vajpayee Bhawan. While the defection of a state president is a seismic event in its own right, for the Congress, the true weight of the moment lies in its resemblance to the events of 2015.It appears the ""ghosts"" of the past have returned to haunt the grand-old party just as the state gears up for the 2026 assembly elections.Ahead of the 2016 assembly elections, Himana left Congress after the party high command projected Tarun Gogoi's son as the face of Assam’s Congress leadership despite Sarma's key role in managing the 2011 election campaign for the party and helping it win an unprecedented 79 seats in the 126-member assembly.Recalling the event, Sarma recently claimed that Sonia had virtually cleared his name for the chief minister’s post -- only for a phone call from Rahul Gandhi to change everything.“Madam ( Sonia Gandhi ), whom I still refer to as such, had asked me to decide on the date and I had told her that I would take oath the day after the Ambubachi Mela at Kamakhya Temple in June (2014),” he said.“The situation changed after Rahul Gandhi made the calls,” Sarma added.History repeated itself in Borah’s case. Following his resignation, Congress leaders reached out to a long-faced Borah but failed. All India Congress Committee (AICC) state in-charge Jitendra Singh stated that Borah had “withdrawn” his resignation after discussions with the party leadership, including Rahul Gandhi, and that the resignation had not been accepted.However, Borah claimed Rahul called him “but did not say a word” about his resignation letter.“He mentioned how we helped the party grow, and he helped me over the years, which is true, but he did not say a word about my resignation letter,” Borah told news agency PTI.“I had told Rahul Gandhi that I am feeling humiliated in the party, and then he said that he was also feeling humiliated. Then what is the value of my humiliation? I cannot tolerate such humiliation as I do not have so much capacity,” he added.During this time, the Assam chief minister announced that the doors of the BJP were open for Borah, promising that he would help him win from a “safe seat” in the assembly polls.Many flashpoints contributed to the bitterness between Borah and Congress. In his letter to Kharge, Borah listed his grievances against Gaurav Gogoi and Rakibul Hussain.After resigning from the party, Borah launched an attack on a section of Congress leaders without taking names. He said he was prepared to stay in the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) but not in “APCC (R),” in an apparent reference to Hussain.“The prevailing perception in Assam is that the state unit of the Congress is being steered under the influence of Rakibul Hussain, a leadership arrangement that has not found resonance with a substantial section of the majority community in Upper Assam. His apparent connivance with Shri Jitendra Singh has further propelled the party towards calamity, pushing it to the brink of disaster and leading it ominously towards political doom. Politics, after all, is as much about perception as it is about principle, and when confidence erodes across key constituencies, the consequences are neither trivial nor transient,” the letter read.Borah also accused Gogoi of subjecting him to marginalisation in the party’s decision-making process.“Personal reversals I can withstand, but self-respect and dignity are not currencies with which I may barter. I find myself neither consulted on substantive party matters nor accorded the regard befitting a senior colleague. I do not articulate these reflections in a spirit of rancour, but in genuine perplexity as to why I appear to have been subjected to marginalisation at the hands of Gaurav Gogoi and Rakibul Hussain,” the letter read.Later, he alleged that Gogoi had broken the opposition alliance that he had stitched together a few years ago, fearing that if the opposition came to power “by chance,” he might not become the chief minister.“When I was given the responsibility to take the alliance forward once again on February 9, what was the point of including Dhubri MP Rakibul Hussain in the talks?” he asked.“Gogoi perhaps felt that if the alliance took shape, then Bhupen Borah would put everything amicably before Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, threatening his existence,” he claimed.Borah, who was chairman of the ‘Assam Sanmilita Mancha’ — a front of 16 opposition parties — also claimed that before the bypolls to five assembly constituencies in 2024, it was decided that a CPI(ML) candidate would contest the Behali seat as the outfit had secured 40,000 votes in the previous election.“I agreed to it, but my proposal was not considered by the AICC. Two or three leaders from the state unit also started discussing other names. Finally, a person was named as the Congress candidate who, till then, was not even a member of the party,” he said.“The leaders of the other alliance parties then told me that if you cannot leave even one seat out of the five, what is there left to discuss for the 126 seats in the next elections? I then resigned as head of the coalition on moral grounds, and the Congress candidate lost badly,” he added.Borah also said that Congress state in-charge Jitendra Singh chaired a meeting with six leaders on February 9, where he was given responsibility for taking forward alliance talks ahead of the assembly polls.“I accepted it as it was the party’s decision. I also felt that an alliance was necessary as Congress could not tackle the BJP alone. I saw a need to unite anti-BJP votes,” he said.He added that the next day, Gogoi told him Rakibul Hussain would be actively involved in the talks.“I told him this was not the decision taken at the meeting. In the meantime, Nagaon Congress MP Pradyut Bordoloi called me and said that if Rakibul was there, he would not tolerate it,” Borah claimed.“Amid this, Gaurav publicly said I was spreading misinformation about leading the talks. I had already spoken to leaders of other parties, including Akhil Gogoi,” he said.Meanwhile, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma claimed Borah’s resignation marked a “separation” of Congress from Hindu society, calling him the last recognised Hindu leader in the state unit.“Bhupen Borah was the last recognised Hindu leader of the Congress,” Sarma said.Sarma asserted that more Congress leaders would cross over to the BJP and claimed disillusioned Muslim leaders might join Raijor Dal.“The BJP will have Raijor Dal and not Congress as its opposition in the 2031 assembly polls,” he claimed.Drawing parallels with his own journey, Sarma said Borah’s resignation reflected deeper issues within Congress.“His resignation carries the symbolic message that in Congress, no one from a normal family can prosper. Congress does not give recognition to people from ordinary families. I hail from an ordinary middle-class family, and the BJP has made me a chief minister,” he said.Assam is not the only state where Congress is facing internal rifts.In Karnataka, chief minister Siddaramaiah and deputy DK Shivakumar have publicly displayed tensions. In Odisha, Mohammed Moquim resigned, citing organisational issues.During the Bihar assembly elections, cracks resurfaced within Congress’s state unit. Rebel leaders protested after being denied tickets. The party eventually emerged as the weakest link in its alliance, recording the lowest strike rate among major partners.Borah now joins a growing list of leaders who exited Congress after clashes with the high command or state-level rivalries, including Jyotiraditya Scindia, Ghulam Nabi Azad, and Jitin Prasada, all of whom quit the party to join rivals.In the run-up to assembly elections in the state, the Congress finds itself at a crossroads, trying to navigate not only the BJP but also the familiar internal frictions that have historically hindered its momentum.","Former assam congress chief bhupen borah to join bjp, assam cm himanta biswa sarma confirms.
