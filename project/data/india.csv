Tamil Nadu can't oppose NEP and still expect SSA funds: Pradhan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tamil-nadu-cant-oppose-nep-and-still-expect-ssa-funds-pradhan/articleshow/124035634.cms,"Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan with young innovators and entrepreneurs at IIT Madras in Chennai on Sunday

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu can't expect the Centre to relent on Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan funding while stubbornly refusing to accept the National Education Policy (NEP), Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Sunday while accusing the DMK govt of ""imposing its political priorities"" on students by sticking to its two-language formula.""I have said this repeatedly in the state, and also in the Parliament, that our country has adopted NEP. We have to go by that. You have to accept the MoU offered by the Union govt. We are ready to cooperate (by releasing funds), but cooperation has to be mutual,"" Pradhan told reporters on the sidelines of an event at IIT Madras.He said the Union govt wasn't imposing any language on the state. ""I want to clarify - students wish to choose a third language.""The minister argued that only 10% of India's population spoke English, yet nobody was opposed to it.""When you can learn English, what's wrong in learning another Indian language?"" He alleged that DMK's two-language policy was ""creating fear psychosis"" in Tamil Nadu.Pradhan said it was wrong to assume the Centre had stopped funding education in the state, citing uninterrupted allocations for all schemes other than for Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.""Funds are being released regularly for the mid-day meal scheme. Tamil Nadu is getting funds for its adult literacy programme, too.""At IIT Madras's Dakshinapatha Summit, Pradhan said he wanted to learn Tamil because it was a vibrant language. He said the Union govt was planning to incorporate skill-based learning into the higher secondary curriculum per the recommendations of NEP.""Education in the past focused on science, commerce and humanities. Now, we are planning to add skilling,"" the Union education minister said, adding that students would have the option of studying drone technology or AI as part of the skilling curriculum.","Dharmendra pradhan: tamil nadu can't expect centre to relent on sarva shiksha abhiyan funding while stubbornly refusing to accept the national education policy.

PM Modi Calls For Self-Reliance As Tensions With U.S. Continue; Lauds GST Reforms | WATCH

NEW DELHI: Congress lashed out at govt on Sunday, alleging that PM Narendra Modi addressed the nation on Sunday evening to claim ""sole ownership"" of amendments made to GST regime by GST Council. Calling the latest reforms ""inadequate"", the party said the PM's talk of a ""savings festival of Rs 2.5 lakh crore"" was like ""applying band-aid after inflicting deep wounds"".The party has sought that govt apologise to the public for imposing GST on essential items. In a post on X, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge criticised the PM by citing a Hindi proverb, 'nau sau choohe khakar billi haj ko chali' ('After committing many sins, the cat goes on a pilgrimage'). ""Instead of the simple and efficient GST of Congress, your govt imposed 'Gabbar Singh Tax' by collecting from nine different slabs and collected more than Rs 55 lakh crore in eight years,"" he alleged.""Now you are talking about putting a simple band-aid after inflicting deep wounds on the public by talking about a 'savings festival' of Rs 2.5 lakh crore! The public will never forget that you collected GST on pulses, rice, grains, pencils, books, treatment, farmers' tractors, etc.Your govt should apologise to the public!"" he added.Congress general secretary in-charge of communications Jairam Ramesh, in a post on X, said, ""PM addressed the nation today to claim sole ownership of the amendments made to GST regime by GST Council, a constitutional body."" He went on to say that Congress has long argued that GST has been a ""Growth Suppressing Tax"". ""We have been demanding a GST 2.0 since July 2017. This was a key pledge made in our 'Nyay Patra' for 2024 Lok Sabha elections,"" he added.Holding that the latest ""GST reforms are inadequate"", Ramesh stressed that the key demand of states ""made in true spirit of cooperative federalism - namely, extension of compensation for another five years to fully protect their revenues - remains unaddressed"".In a scathing attack posted on X, Congress' Supriya Shrinate said, ""Modi ji is cursing the old GST as if someone else had implemented it. You yourself imposed Gabbar Singh Tax and collected it for eight years. Have you forgotten?""Other outstanding issues enumerated by Ramesh include widespread concerns of MSMEs that, he said, must be ""addressed meaningfully"". ""Sectoral issues that have surfaced - for instance in textiles, tourism, exporters, handicrafts and agricultural inputs - must be tackled,"" he said, adding, ""States should be incentivised to move towards introduction of state-level GST to cover electricity, alcohol, petroleum, and real estate as well. """"Whether this round of GST changes - delayed by eight years - will actually boost private investment that is essential for higher GDP growth remains to be seen. Meanwhile, trade deficit with China has doubled in past five years to cross $100 billion. And Indian business is crippled by fear and oligopolisation that is leading many to resettle abroad,"" Ramesh asserted.","The party has sought that govt apologise to the public for imposing gst on essential items.

Sarcophagus redraws Harappan age south-north trade map,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sarcophagus-redraws-harappan-age-south-north-trade-map/articleshow/124035553.cms,"Deposits at the archeological site in Tamil Nadu

Smoke from a funeral pyre over 3,700 years ago left behind a trail of charcoal. That faint trace, sealed inside a terracotta sarcophagus buried in Kilnamandi village of Tiruvannamalai district, has now rewritten Tamil Nadu's ancient past. Radiocarbon analysis in a US laboratory dated the deposit to 1692 BCE, placing this burial in the late Harappan age and hinting at trade links between southern India and regions as far away as Gujarat and Maharashtra.Burial offerings scattered around the stone coffin tell their own story. Etched carnelian beads, once prized in Harappan centres, lay beside graffiti-inscribed potsherds. ""Carnelian beads were available in Maharashtra and Gujarat regions. So, it clearly establishes a trade contact with the north during the later Harappan period,"" said K Rajan, professor and academic adviser to Tamil Nadu State Dept of Archaeology (TNSDA).Harappan or Indus Valley Civilization is generally dated between 3300 BCE and 1300 BCE. Rajan said the new dating also pushes TN's graffiti tradition further back. ""The grave goods contain graffiti-bearing pots, which indirectly places the date of the graffiti marks in TN to the 17th century BCE,"" he said.Symbols carved onto the shoulders of the pots include fork-like shapes, semi-concentric circles in a U-formation, and vertical strokes with wavering lines superimposed.Excavators G Victor Gnanaraj and M Suresh said in their field report that some graffiti appeared restricted to specific burials, suggesting they could belong to members of the same clan.A larger study by Rajan and TNSDA joint director R Sivanandam examined 140 archaeological sites and found striking parallels between TN graffiti and markings at Indus Valley locations - nearly 90% shared similarities. ""The AMS date of the sarcophagus gives authenticity to our study on graffiti marks,"" Sivanandam said.Objects unearthed at Kilnamandi, including iron tools and pottery finds, add to the picture of a complex society. State archaeology minister Thangam Thennarasu released on Saturday this AMS-dating result, one among 139 scientific dates collated by the department, alongside preliminary excavation reports at Keeladi near Madurai.","Deposits at the archeological site in tamil nadu suggest trade links between southern india and regions as far away as gujarat and maharashtra.

Poll Should stronger security measures be implemented in Gurgaon? Yes, it needs better safety No, current measures are sufficient





GURGAON: In yet another alarming incident of lawlessness in Gurgaon, unidentified assailants opened fire at the office of MNR Buildmark in Sector 45 late Thursday night.The attack, which took place around 9.30pm barely a few hundred meters from the Sector 40 police station, has raised serious concerns about security in the area.According to sources, four to five armed men scaled the iron gate of the premises and opened fire at the locked office.More than 15 rounds were fired, some of which struck two luxury cars — a Jaguar and a BMW — parked inside the compound. Security guards on duty rushed indoors to take cover. No casualties were reported.Soon after, gangster Deepak Nandal claimed responsibility for the attack, alleging that Nitin Talwar — a relative of Rohit Raheja, owner of MNR Buildmark — owed him money but had fled to New Zealand with his family in 2019.In a purported message, Nandal also warned others who owed him money and alleged that singer Rahul Yadav alias Fazilpuria had to return Rs 5 crore.Investigations have been complicated by the fact that the CCTV cameras at the premises were found to be non-functional at the time of the incident.Police teams, including a forensic unit and multiple CIA squads, reached the spot soon after the firing. Sub-Inspector Baljeet Singh confirmed that “multiple rounds were fired,” but stressed that no injuries occurred.The motive behind the attack remains under probe.","Unidentified assailants opened fire at the office of mnr buildmark in sector 45 late thursday night.

AHMEDABAD: A Gujarati woman was shot dead during a robbery attempt at her convenience store in Union County late Tuesday night.The victim was identified as Kiran Patel, 49, who ran DD's Food Mart on South Pinckney Street.Police said they received a call around 10.30pm about a man firing shots outside the store. When officers arrived, they found Patel lying unresponsive in the parking lot with gunshot wounds. Emergency medical services later confirmed her death.According to investigators, surveillance video captured the sequence of events.A masked man entered the store with a gun and demanded money from Patel, who was working alone.During the confrontation, the assailant fired a shot, and Patel tried to resist by throwing something at him. The robber then climbed onto the cash register counter and fired multiple rounds inside the store.Patel attempted to flee towards the parking lot, but the gunman chased her, continuing to shoot.She collapsed just 20 feet away from the store entrance after being struck by bullets. Officers also recovered shell casings and found the store's front window shattered.The Union County coroner's office confirmed Patel's identity and said she suffered fatal injuries from the gunfire.This tragedy comes at a time when the US is witnessing renewed debate over gun control laws.South Carolina, like many states, allows relatively easy access to firearms, and incidents of violence at small businesses have become frequent. Community members described Patel as a hardworking immigrant who ran the store for years and was well-known in the area.The Union Public Safety Department has launched a manhunt for the suspect, who fled the scene after the shooting.Police said they are reviewing CCTV footage and have appealed to the public for information.","Victim identified as kiran patel, 49, who ran dd's food mart in union county.

Kept inside airport for five days, taken to emergency room

'We are lost,' says Paramjit's brother





Paramjit Singh, an Indian who immigrated to the US more than 30 years ago, has been detained by the ICE and kept in custody for over a month now. Paramjit is a green card holder and has been doing business in Fort Wayne, Indiana, for the last three decades. He was detained at Chicago O'Hare Airport on July 30 as he was returning from a trip to India, as he makes trips to India several times a year.Singh's attorney Luis Angeles toldthat his detention was absolutely illegal and that the government is increasing his health risks as Singh has a brain tumor and heart issues.But why was Singh arrested in the first place? His attorney and family members said that the government cited an incident from the past when Singh used a pay phone without paying. It was a ""minor infraction for which he has already taken full accountability, served his time, and paid his debt to society,"" Angeles said.Also read: EB-5 investment visa cap reached for 2025, green card route paused till September 30 Narrating the harrowing details of what happened since Singh was detained, his family members revealed that he was kept inside the airport for five days. His health condition deteriorated to the point where he had to be taken to the emergency room. His family was not notified about his health and they only came to know when the ER bill was sent to them.""As a lawful permanent resident (green card holder), Mr Singh should never have been detained in the first place, as he has always followed the rules to the letter.

"Appointed, ignored & unpaid: Meet India's 'invisible' teachers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/appointed-ignored-unpaid-meet-indias-invisible-teachers/articleshow/124033011.cms,"In 1983, Md Aftab Alam was hired as a regular college lecturer - on paper. Forty-two years later, he's still waiting for his first salary. The appointment letter, issued by Sanjay Gandhi Mahila College in Gaya, promised pay and service conditions on a par with university faculty. What followed was four decades of unpaid teaching, no employee ID, no pension - just a man showing up to class every day with a PhD and no payslip.""I taught, I evaluated papers, I invigilated exams,"" he said. ""But officially, it's as if I was never there."" His only proof is a fading sheet of paper from 1983 and a lifetime of unacknowledged labour.Last month, in a sharply worded verdict, Supreme Court ruled that 18 assistant professors in Gujarat - hired on contract and paid far less than their regular colleagues - had been denied basic constitutional protections. The bench, led by Justice Abhay S Oka, invoked a line familiar to nearly every Indian classroom: ""Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshwara."" The words, the court said, mean little if teachers are paid a pittance. Alam and thousands of haplesss teachers like him would know.The truth is harder than what the verdict suggests: in places far from Gujarat, and in classrooms that do not appear in affidavits, teachers still work for Rs 3,000 a month.Or Rs 1,000. Or nothing at all.Alam lives in a rented two-room flat in Gaya, where the plaster peels and the only reliable light comes from a window that faces the street.Every morning, Alam folds his PhD certificate back into a drawer, picks up the same well-thumbed books he has taught from for years, and steps out toward a college that never recognised him as its own. His wife, Shamsun Nisa, said the only income now comes from occasional evaluation work during university exams. “Even private tuition stopped after Covid,” she said. “People think he’s too broken to teach. But he still reads. He still steps out in the morning dressed for work.”He began teaching English there in 1983, just after completing his master’s from Magadh University. Though formally hired under university-approved terms, the college denied him regular employee status. “When I asked for a salary,” he said, “they told me I was just a part-time teacher.” Magadh University, in response to an RTI application, confirmed Alam had indeed been appointed as regular faculty. In 2023, the state’s higher education director directed the university registrar to take necessary action. Nothing changed. “I couldn’t afford lawyers,” Alam said. “Sometimes I couldn't afford two meals a day.”India’s education system — vast, decentralised, often romanticised — rests on people like Alam. People who carry attendance registers without knowing whether they’ll be compensated for it. People who prepare lectures, invigilate exams, sign logbooks, evaluate answer sheets, and still have to take private tuition just to afford a sack of rice. Alam is not the only oneThe numbers alone tell a story that’s difficult to look away from. There are more than 10,000 teachers in 220 unaided affiliated degree colleges across Bihar. At Banwari College, commerce lecturer Deepak Kumar Singh teaches every day. His salary last year was Rs 9,000. In 2022–23, it was Rs 21,000. Before that, for four consecutive years, he received nothing. “No holidays, no leave. We come, we teach,” he said. “We mark attendance on the biometric machine like everyone else. ” The biometric scanner at the entrance does not care whether its data leads to a pay slip.Others never got even that far. Shankar Bhagat, who taught ancient Indian history in the same college, died of liver cirrhosis without treatment. Another colleague, Mukesh Kumar Mishra, is battling cancer in Muzaffarpur. His salary wasn’t enough to even consider a private hospital. “These are PhD holders,” said Arun Gautam, a senior teacher and media-in-charge of the Federation of Affiliated Degree College Teachers’ Associations of Bihar.This neglect, over time, has ossified into routine. A 2013 policy promised performance-based grants to unaided institutions — linking funding to student outcomes. But funds were never consistently released. Today, teachers are paid, if at all, from the internal revenues of their colleges: exam fees, certificate charges, hostel deposits. Many have no formal employment letters. Some earn barely Rs 1,500 a month.In Gujarat, the disparities played out on official contracts — but the outcome was no less punishing. Between 2008 and 2014, over 450 engineers were hired as assistant professors on fixed-term contracts. Some were placed in govt engineering colleges, others in polytechnics. They were paid Rs 30,000 or Rs 25,000, and told their tenure would end once Gujarat Public Service Commission filled the sanctioned posts.Naitik Gor was among them. He joined a govt polytechnic institute in 2013 and worked 32 hours a week — nearly double the regular load — and took on the full slate of responsibilities: practicals, examinations, even election duties. “There were no vacations, no earned leave. Same job, half the pay,” he said. In 2020, he walked away and took a position at a private firm in Ahmedabad.In 2018, over 300 contractual faculty like him went to Gujarat HC. They argued the disparity in pay violated Articles 14, 15, 16 and 19 of the Constitution. In 2023, a singlejudge bench agreed, calling it a “crying shame” that qualified lecturers, appointed by due process, were still kept on ad hoc contracts. The state appealed. Two division benches rejected its argument. A third overturned the decision. The matter reached SC.The apex court has now ruled in the petitioners’ favour. Gujarat govt has been ordered to pay arrears with 8% interest from 2015, and to align these teachers with the pay scale of regular assistant professors. But much of damage is already done. Gor said most of the original petitioners had left teaching.The erosion is not just economic — it is emotional, generational, institutional. Siksha Mitras — guest teachers recruited in large numbers in the early 2000s — were briefly regularised in 2015, drawing salaries of Rs 50,000. Two years later, the decision was reversed. Their salaries dropped back to Rs 10,000. “We were promoted, then demoted,” said Meenu Goswami, a Siksha Mitra in Bulandshahr, UP, who lives with a leg disability. She recounted at least a dozen suicides among demoted teachers in her district. “Some had loans, others lost homes. The salary cut killed them.” Shaily Sharma spent five years teaching at a small school in Amroha. She holds a postgraduate degree and a BEd. By 2015, she had become principal. Her salary was Rs 4,500 a month. “I loved the work,” she said. “But love doesn’t pay rent.” She left teaching in 2016.Teachers in Lucknow’s top-tier schools might earn Rs 60,000 or more. But those are few. Most private school teachers, even at well-known institutions, are paid Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000. “Even the fancy schools don’t offer more,” said Atul Srivastava, president of the Association of Private Schools, UP.The longer-term effects are showing across Uttar Pradesh. Since 2021, there has been no recruitment of govt school teachers. Thousands of schools now run entirely on guest faculty. “There’s no pipeline anymore,” said Dinesh Sharma, president of the Uttar Pradesh Primary Teachers’ Association. “People are migrating to other states.” The National Education Policy 2020 promised to restore dignity to the teaching profession. It called for better pay, regularisation, and a clear career path.","In 1983, md aftab alam was hired as a regular college lecturer - on paper.

NEW DELHI: Amid instances of builders and their agents using “govt-style terminology” to make their projects resemble official housing schemes, the Centre has asked states and real estate regulators (RERAs) to take action to stop such advertisements to prevent buyers from being deceived. They have also been asked to submit reports to ensure the protection of buyers’ interests.Sources said there was a detailed discussion on the issue at a recent meeting of the Central Advisory Council (CAC) of RERA, chaired by housing and urban affairs minister Manohar Lal Khattar. Some samples of such misleading advertisements were also shared with all members, including representatives from state govts and RERA authorities.“This has been identified as a persistent issue, and hence, there is a need to address it immediately,"" said one of the CAC members. The ministry, in its presentation, pointed out that in some cases, advertisements did not disclose the names of publishers or promoters. “By doing so, such players bypass all mandatory norms, such as disclosing specific information related to projects. It appears that many of these advertisements are being disseminated by real estate agents,” a source said.Abhay Upadhyay, a member of the CAC and president of the homebuyers’ group FPCE, has written to Khattar, emphasizing the need to crack down on misleading advertisements to protect consumers. In fact, a study conducted by the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) in Maharashtra last year found that out of 2,087 advertisements, 1,027 were in violation of the norms laid down by the Maharashtra RERA.FPCE has also raised concerns about data mismatches between RERA web pages, developers’ websites, and sanctioned plans, urging the govt to implement a system to eliminate such discrepancies.","The centre has asked states and real estate regulators (reras) to take action to stop such advertisements.

For years, she had fought for the rescue of Delhi’s only African elephant, kept in solitary confinement at the city zoo.Now, she hopes Shankar’s passing will prevent a similar fate for Rambo, the only remaining African elephant in captivity at Mysuru Zoo.Dhawan first saw Shankar four years ago on a trip to Delhi Zoo with her parents, and felt something shift inside her. The elephant, one of two brought to India in 1998 as a diplomatic gift from Zimbabwe, stood alone, his feet bound with metallic chains. His companion had died in 2001, and since then, the elephant named after former Indian president Shankar Dayal Sharma lived in isolation — a cruel fate for a species known for their social nature and desire for companionship.“At that time, he was chained for 17 hours a day. He was also in the proximity of trains, which was very harmful to his ears. He was showing a lot of stressful behaviour,” she said.Dhawan, whose love for wildlife stemmed from the many trips she made with her parents to sanctuaries, decided to channel her heartbreak into action. She started a non-profit called Youth for Animals to mobilise support and help Shankar get out of the zoo.Soon, other young volunteers joined, filed RTIs and sent letters to the Delhi Zoo and the Prime Minister. They also gathered video evidence of his physical and mental state. In 2022, they officially filed a public interest litigation in Delhi high court.“An inspection report for Shankar was ordered, but it was not done by an independent third-party. So, we didn’t feel like the results accurately reflected his condition,” Dhawan says. It was decided that Shankar would be kept at the zoo. Then, in March 2023, the Supreme Court increased the jurisdiction and powers of a high-powered committee led by Justice (retd) Deepak Verma, to conduct necessary checks and fact-finding exercises concerning wild animals, including those in captivity, across India. That brought hope to Dhawan, and she focused on getting transfer options ready for Shankar.“We knew something had to be done urgently. Elephants are very social animals, and you can’t just rip them out of the wild and make them live on their own. For nearly 13 years, Shankar had no visual or oral communication, even with the other Asian elephants at the zoo,” says Dhawan.UK-based Aspinall Foundation, which runs multiple sanctuaries across Africa, agreed to shift the lonely elephant, and take care of the expenses too. However, the domestic authorities wanted to keep Shankar in India, Dhawan says. Hence, the search for a domestic alternative began. Last summer, she visited Vantara, the animal rescue arm of Reliance Foundation in Jamnagar, which expressed interest in housing Shankar alongside other African elephants. “We sent that option to the high-powered committee, but received no response,” she says.Meanwhile, pressure began to mount on the Delhi zoo authorities. In Oct 2024, the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums suspended its license over concerns about Shankar’s living conditions. The body asked the authorities to either improve the conditions or relocate him. However, before that could happen, Shankar passed away at the age of 29, years before the species’ average life expectancy of 70. An inquiry has been ordered into the cause of the death, while zoo officials claim that Shankar showed no signs of illness and the collapse was sudden. “I feel that the zoo had the option and the funding to make a better life for Shankar, but they chose not to take it. I do believe his death was preventable,” Dhawan emphasises.Currently studying at Stanford University, she hopes that the death will urge more Indian youngsters to speak up against the exploitation of animals for public entertainment. Her focus is now Rambo, the African elephant in Mysuru who has been alone since 2016 following the death of his father. “I really hope that Shankar’s death highlights the need to save Rambo before it’s too late.”","Shankar, delhi's only african elephant, died on wednesday at the age of 29.

NEW DELHI: Popular singer Zubeen Garg will be cremated with full state honours on September 23 at a village near Guwahati, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Sunday.The decision to cremate Garg at Kamarkuchi NC village was taken during a cabinet meeting, considering the family's wish that his last rites be performed at a place in or around Guwahati, Sarma said at a press conference.There were also demands from the people of the Upper Assam town of Jorhat, where the singer had spent his formative years, that he be cremated there, he said.''We discussed both the proposals. Zubeen does not belong to the government, and so his family's choice should be given priority,'' Sarma said.His wife Garima Saikia Garg and sister Pamle Borthakur pointed out that it would not be possible for his 85-year-old ailing father to go Jorhat for the last rites and even later during anniversaries or other rituals, it would be difficult for the family to go there, the CM said.''Three of my cabinet colleagues - Ranoj Pegu, Keshav Mahanta and Bimal Borah - and also a delegation of the All Assam Students' Union (AASU) had discussed the matter with his wife and she had conveyed the family's decision to hold the last rites in Guwahati'', Sarma said.Besides, Garg had lived in Guwahati for the most part of his life, he added.''We, however, respect the sentiments of the people of Jorhat, with the Cabinet deciding that his ashes will be immersed there and a memorial will be built there,'' Sarma said.Regarding the request of the people of Jorhat to at least take Garg’s mortal remains there for one last time, the CM said that his body was not in a condition to be taken there and again brought back to Guwahati for cremation.A memorial will also be built at the place where he will be cremated near Guwahati, he added.The cremation site encompasses 3.3 acres of government land where some local people had set up a plant nursery, and they eagerly gave it for Garg’s funeral, he said.The CM said that he had visited the site while returning from Delhi on Sunday and will go there again on Sunday night to review arrangements for the cremation.He said that the place can accommodate around 5,000 people and appealed to Garg's fans to pay their last respects to him at the Arjun Bhogeswar Baruah Sports Complex, where his body will be kept till the morning of September 23.The state government had declared a three-day mourning till September 22, but it has been extended by another day for his cremation, the CM said.On the day of the cremation, the highway adjacent to the site of the last rites will remain closed for heavy vehicles.Sarma also said the Singapore government has issued the singer's death certificate, which states that he died due to drowning.''The Indian High Commission in Singapore has sent us the death certificate, and we have also requested that the postmortem report be also sent to us at the earliest,'' Sarma added.Garg died in Singapore while swimming in the sea on Friday.Regarding the investigations into the case registered by the CID following Zubeen's death, the CM said that statements of those who filed multiple FIRs against the two accused are being recorded.Both the accused - North East India Festival (NEIF) Chief Organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta and the singer's manager Siddhartha Sharma - are now not here, and ''my top priority now is to ensure Zubeen's last rites are conducted smoothly,'' he said.Besides, the place of occurrence is Singapore, so the police of that country will investigate the case, and ''we can only look into whether he was taken there as a part of a conspiracy'', Sarma said.''We shall proceed step by step, but let me first fulfil my duty and responsibility of giving Zubeen the farewell he deserves with dignity and respect,'' the CM said.","Zubeen garg will be cremated with full state honours on september 23 at a village near guwahati, assam chief minister himanta biswa sarma said on sunday.

In a significant milestone for the ambitious undersea tunnel project between BKC and Shillphata, the New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM) has successfully achieved a breakthrough for its 5 km tunnel stretch.This critical section, which runs 4.881 km, notably includes a challenging 7 km segment beneath the Thane Creek. Tunneling commenced in May 2024, and on July 9, engineers celebrated the first breakthrough for a continuous 2.7 km section, connecting the ADIT to the Savali shaft.With this achievement, excavation is now complete between the Savali shaft and the tunnel portal at Shillphata, paving the way for the tunnel's integration with the viaduct segment of the Mega Airport High-Speed Rail (MAHSR) project. To accelerate the process, an Additional Driven Intermediate Tunnel (ADIT) was constructed, enabling simultaneous excavation from both Ghansoli and Shilphata sides.The remaining 16 km of tunnelling will be executed using Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs). The tunnel will be a single tube tunnel of 13.1 meters in diameter to accommodate twin track for both up and down lines.Comprehensive safety measures have been implemented at the site, including ground settlement markers, piezometers, inclinometers, and strain gauges to ensure safe and controlled tunnelling activities without disturbing nearby structures.Proper arrangements were made to restrict access to the tunnel construction sites, preventing unauthorised entry and ensuring the safety of workers within the sensitive and complex construction environment. Provisions were made for pumping fresh air inside the tunnel for the construction workers.India's first 508 km long Bullet Train corridor, connecting Mumbai and Ahmedabad, is making significant progress. Out of the total length of 508 km, 321 km of viaduct and 398 km of pier work have already been completed.Additionally, all 17 river bridges and 9 steel bridges have been finished. To enhance noise control, more than 400,000 noise barriers have been installed along a 206 km stretch. The construction of 206 km of track bed has also been completed, alongside the installation of over 2,000 OHE masts, which cover approximately 48 km of the mainline viaduct.Currently, excavation work is ongoing for 7 mountain tunnels located in Palghar district.Meanwhile, the superstructure work on all stations in Gujarat is at an advanced stage, and construction has commenced on all three elevated stations, with base slab casting in progress at the Mumbai underground station in Maharashtra.","New austrian tunnelling method achieves milestone breakthrough in bkc-shillphata undersea tunnel project.

All electors included in the roll on the date of issue of the nationwide SIR order by EC will be given enumeration forms by booth level officers (BLOs), and whoever signs and submits the form, with or without documents as required, either directly to the BLOs or through the parties' booth-level agents (BLAs), will be included in the draft roll.""The pre-SIR activities undertaken by the states/UTs identify electors who were there in the rolls from the last intensive revision, and they shall be presumed to be citizens, as will their children, and do not need to submit any documents. They may constitute 50-60% of the current electorate; it is only the remaining 40% of electors that the BLOs will need to focus on for making house-to-house visits and collecting their enumeration forms along with documents to prove their citizenship,"" said an Election Commission functionary.The EC had written to all state/UT CEOs on July 5, 2025, asking them to begin preparations for a Bihar-like SIR exercise with Jan 1, 2026, as the qualifying date.The states/UTs have since been busy with the digitisation and uploading of electoral rolls from the last intensive revision on the CEO's website, mapping electors in the roll from last SIR with the current roll, rationalisation of polling stations to cap electors at 1,200 and the training of officials involved in SIR.The special summary revision undertaken at the end of each year, with Jan 1 of the following year as the reference date, usually begins with pre-revision activities in Aug-Sept, followed by publication of draft roll in Oct-end, the filing of claims and objections by Nov-end and their settlement by Dec-end.
