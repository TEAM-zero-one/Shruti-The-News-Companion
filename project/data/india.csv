NEW DELHI: Days after calling Rahul Gandhi “darpok” (coward) and “insecure”, former Congress leader Shakeel Ahmad on Tuesday claimed that his residence faces a threat of attack. He shared a screenshot of a WhatsApp message which he alleged was circulated by party members, calling on district and assembly-level leaders to burn his effigy in protest over his “inappropriate statements” about Rahul Gandhi.Sharing the chats on X, Ahmad wrote: “Now my information has turned out to be absolutely spot on. Many thanks to the old mates from Congress. There's a saying in our Bihar that old friends are the ones who come in handy. Is this happening without Rahul ji's orders?”The message he posted read: “Former Congress leader Shakeel Ahmad has been continuously making inappropriate statements about our respected leader Shri Rahul Gandhi. The top leadership has directed that all District Presidents and Assembly Presidents should, in their respective areas, burn an effigy of Shakeel Ahmad on 27/12/2026 to register strong protest.”Escalating the spat further, in a post late Monday, Ahmad further alleged that the Congress leadership in Bihar has ""ordered"" party workers to attack his residence.“Just now, some colleagues from the Congress have secretly informed me that the Congress national leadership has ordered the Bihar Congress/Youth Congress to attack my residences in Patna and Madhubani tomorrow, January 27, under the pretext of burning an effigy,” he wrote on X.The controversy follows Ahmad’s scathing remarks about Gandhi. “Rahul Gandhi is a coward and an insecure person. He does not get that 'boss feeling' before anyone who is senior to him or has a big public support. He is uncomfortable with any such person and is thus dictatorial and not democratic,” he told PTI.Congress leader Manickam Tagore hit back, calling Ahmad a “betrayer” and “Jaichand”. “I am not shocked. Just saddened, yet again,? by how betrayal becomes loud when courage walks the longest road,” Tagore wrote on X, adding that such attacks were about “TV time, relevance and pleasing new masters”.Ahmad, a former Union minister and ex-Congress general secretary who quit the party after the 2025 Bihar elections, has also accused Gandhi of sidelining senior leaders and influencing the 2022 party presidential poll in favour of Mallikarjun Kharge.",Former congress leader shakeel ahmad claims his residence faces a threat of attack.

'I was held hostage'

Politics erupts over the incident

NEW DELHI: Calling the new University Grants Commission (UGC) rules a ""black law,"" Bareilly city magistrate Alankar Agnihotri resigned on Monday, saying the new rules meant for higher educational institutions could foment caste-based discontent.Agnihotri alleged that the new UCC law would vitiate the academic environment in colleges and should be withdrawn immediately.Agnihotri, a 2019-batch Provincial Civil Service officer, sent his resignation by e-mail to Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel and Bareilly District Magistrate Avinash Singh, the officials told news agency PTI.The new rules notified by the UGC on January 13 -- the Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026 -- have sparked widespread criticism from general category students who argue that the framework could lead to discrimination against them.The new regulations, introduced to stop caste-based discrimination in colleges and universities, ask institutions to set up special committees, helplines and monitoring teams to handle complaints, especially from SC, ST and OBC students.Meanwhile, the Uttar Pradesh government ordered disciplinary action against Agnihotri and attached him to the Shamli District Magistrate.In his resignation letter, Agnihotri said it becomes necessary to ""awaken"" the government when it adopts policies that ""divide society and the nation"".Talking to reporters after attending the Republic Day function Monday morning, Agnihotri said that the new UGC rules would lead to atrocities against Brahmins.The provisions were discriminatory and could lead to social unrest and internal discontent, he said.Levelling a serious charge against the Bareilly district magistrate Avinash Singh, Agnihotri, an alumnus of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) where he studied B.Tech and LLB, said he was held hostage and verbally abused, with people at the DM's residence saying: """" (Pandit has gone mad).""I was held hostage at the DM's residence for 45 minutes. A call came to the DM from Lucknow. I was verbally abused, and they said, 'pandit has gone mad (pandit paagal ho gayaa hai). Keep him hostage all night.' I had already informed the media about my situation. I was released at the behest of the Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP),"" Agnihotri was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Avinash Singh, however, dismissed the allegations, saying that when Agnihotri came to see him, all the Additional District Magistrates (ADMs), Sub-Divisional Magistrates (SDMs), Circle Officers, Local Intelligence Unit (LIU) officials, and the Senior Superintendent of Police of Bareilly were present at the DM's residence.Political leaders, particularly the ruling BJP's rivals, reacted to the development, saying that the resignation was a serious indicator of administrative pressure.Reacting to the development, state Congress president Ajay Rai called Agnihotri's resignation a serious issue.In an X post in Hindi, Rai wrote, ""The lathi charge on Shankaracharya (Avimukteshwaranand) and his disciples, and the administrative pressure -- all this shows that under the BJP rule, the Constitution, faith and freedom of expression are all under threat. The truth must come out. The state will be governed by the Constitution, not by fear,"" he wrote.Senior Samajwadi Party leader and former Bareilly MP Praveen Singh Aron also responded to the development.""The true strength of governance lies in upholding the principles of righteous rule (Raj Dharma) and constitutional values. This is not a question of politics, but of the very soul of democracy,"" he added.Meanwhile, Brahmin leaders have been gathering at the state guest house in Bareilly since Monday afternoon.A resident of Kanpur Nagar, Agnihotri previously served as a sub-divisional magistrate in key districts, including Unnao, Balrampur, and Lucknow. He is known in administrative circles for his straightforward views and strict working style. He has also worked in the United States.",Bareilly city magistrate alankar agnihotri resigns over new university grants commission rules.

NEW DELHI: Soft flute notes rendering Vande Mataram kicked off Republic Day parade and 2,500 artistes drawn from every state and UT performing to a specially composed version of the national song marked its closure, as the celebration of its 150th anniversary, assiduously promoted by governing NDA to project itself as the true inheritor of its cultural legacy and to corner its opponents, took centre stage at the annual event.Mamata Banerjee-led TMC govt could not be unaware of the backdrop of the national song being sought to be put on a higher pedestal when it chose for its tableau a theme that highlighted the state's association with the song, carrying statues of not only its author Bankim Chandra Chatterjee but also iconic Bengali figures like Swami Vivekananda, Rabindranath Tagore and Subhas Chandra Bose.As the state heads for the assembly poll, BJP has stepped up its attack on TMC, accusing the party of turning away from Bengal's Hindu ethos associated with Chatterjee in pursuit of its alleged vote bank politics. TMC, in turn, has called BJP a party run by outsiders disconnected with the state's cultural impulses.The ""150 years of Vande Mataram"" was main theme of this year's parade at Kartavya Path which saw PM Narendra Modi often getting up to explain to the two chief guests, European Council president Antonio Costa and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, the intricacies of the military parade and the procession of tableaux that were a part of the spectacle.Portraits of Chatterjee were displayed at the venue, and several tableaux, including those of BJP-governed Gujarat and Chhattisgarh, paid homage to the song, deeply ingrained in the cultural agenda of BJP and Sangh Parivar.The culture ministry, in its tableau, foregrounded some of its evocative lines, a rallying cry of freedom fighters, and played its two versions, carrying a statue of ""Bharat Mata"". The CPWD's echoed a similar theme. Prints of 1923 paintings from an album on Vande Mataram by Tejendra Kumar Mitra were displayed in and around the venue to bring alive the spirit of patriotism and culture associated with the national song.","2,500 artistes from every state and ut performed to a specially composed version of the national song.

Buried Past

.

Walk down the narrow lanes of this small town — located about 45km southwest of Chandigarh — and you’d find it hard to believe that Chinese scholar Hiuen Tsang trod these very paths some 1,300 years ago. Or that north Indian ruler Prithviraj Chauhan had once passed this way at the head of his army.It’s as if history no longer felt welcome here and moved out, mournful and uncared for. But there was a time when history ebbed and flowed through its narrow lanes. Sirhind — or Sar-iHind, the crown of India — was, after all, the last major outpost before invaders reached the Yamuna. Temples of the Hindu Shahis — who made Sirhind their capital, with its grandeur said to be second only to Lahore’s — still stand south of Islamabad, the oldest surviving temples in Pakistan.But monuments and structures that are often eloquent narrators of past glories stand in Sirhind as mute spectators, listlessly dotting farmlands and alleyways. In many cases, they exist — plastered, painted over, forgotten — as bricks that were repurposed as construction material to build nameless walls of homes that have sprung up in recent decades.The town, which forms a twin city with the adjacent Fatehgarh Sahib, has not only shrunk in size and significance, it has also gone missing from Punjab’s mindscape and its cultural discourse.It is where Humayun defeated the Suris to re-establish Mughal rule and where Guru Gobind Singh’s sons were so cruelly bricked up alive. Sirhind is said by some to go back to the time of the Mahabharata, a melting pot of lore and legend. But, then, how did history itself become a victim in historic Sirhind?Dr Daljit Singh, professor of history at Punjabi University, Patiala, toldthat Sirhind is a treasure trove for archaeologists, but it hasn’t got its due. Encroachments are gobbling up what should be protected spaces. The sense one gets on talking to locals is that every brick and old structure here can tell its own history. The only tough part is to actually find and identify them for what they really are.There is little evidence of any sustained effort by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to explore the historical importance of the area. Despite its rich past as a major provincial centre, there has not been a survey in years to identify historical remains that may lie buried beneath the ground.Some sites, like Gurudwara Shri Fatehgarh Sahib, Rauza Sharif Shrine and a Jain Mandir, are well maintained. But many historical places like Jahazi Haveli of Diwan Todar Mal — not to be confused with Raja Todar Mal of Akbar’s Navratna fame — Aam Khas Bagh and Sadna Kasai Masjid have remained neglected for long. Areas like Harbanspura, Mahadian, Bara and Talanian, where one would stumble on relics three decades ago, are yet to be explored. Buildings and monuments lie crumbling in wheat fields.In the 19th century, French traveller V Jacquemont had described Sirhind as “the biggest ruins in India after Delhi”. Yet today, few ever talk of it. As if it had fallen off the map. There is no trace of the Hindu Shahis in any museum in the country.Elderly residents of Sirhind recall instances of when tilling of the land would turn up artefacts. “Every few days, we would hear someone’s plough had dug up something from history. Bricks were very common to find. Even now such articles turn up. The famous Laalan Wala Bazar near Talanian village is all farmland now,” said 77-yearold Sukhdev Singh. “There were at least four tombs in the area, but we know of two, the Ustad and Shagird tombs. We don’t know what happened to the other two,” he added.Shamsher Singh, 75, of Talanian village, said silver coins, Sirhind bricks and artefacts of various shapes were regularly found near tombs and in the fields. “There was a raised structure near the village but it gradually disappeared as people levelled it up. Now, farming is going on in the same ground. Govt should have protected these historical sites,” he said.At Mahadiyan, famed for how often buried history was dug up during farming, former sarpanch Balwant Singh, 75, said one of the mausoleums he saw as a child has vanished and houses have come up there. “Some 30-35 years ago, ‘Tailay’, which was a sort of currency, would be found in the fields every now and then. Who knows what else would have been found had there been a proper dig?” Khalifa Syed Muhammad Sadiq Raza, who manages affairs at the mausoleum (dargah) of the 17th-century Sufi saint Shaikh Ahmad Faruqi Sirhindi (Mujaddid Alf Sani), said Sirhind was an important province for the Mughals as it lay midway between Delhi and Lahore.Punjab Shahi Imam, Maulana Usman Ludhianvi, said, “Sirhind is an important historical area and needs to be explored in the historical context”.Anecdotes and tales of Sirhind’s buried and forgotten history still keep coming up in conversations. But there are not many who want the past to be dug up. Their fear is that history unearthed would before long get overrun by the present. And will Sirhind then remain the land of fables and myth? Asked about excavations in Sirhind, Sanjeev Kumar Tewari, director-tourism, culture and archaeology, said none has been carried out in the recent past. ASI is carrying out excavations at Sanghol in Fatehgarh Sahib and some other places nearby, he said.“As of now, Jahazi Haveli is being restored. Around 80% of the work has been completed,” he said. Asked why other monuments are in such a state of disrepair, he said minor restoration work was done at the Ustad and Shagird tombs and at the Tomb of Bibi Subhan. “We are getting estimates drawn up for restoration of other monuments. Also, the property towards the rear of Aam Khas Bagh is being given out for commercial usage in PPP mode,” he said.Deputy commissioner Sona Thind acknowledged that Aam Khas Bagh and other tombs needed maintenance and said she has written about it to the tourism and cultural affairs department.","There is little evidence of any sustained effort by archaeological survey of india to explore the historical importance of the area.

NEW DELHI: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi attended Republic Day parade and 'At Home' reception at Rashtrapati Bhavan but the party's criticism of govt for not offering them front row seats in the parade triggered a row, with BJP accusing it of carrying a sense of entitlement. Congress, however, accused BJP of ""petty politicking"".Party MP Vivek Tankha said, ""I was shocked. Opposition used to be treated with respect. BJP leaders of opposition were never treated in this manner. By seating Kharge and Rahul in the back, you are insulting the Constitution. But it is too much to expect grace and respect for opposition from BJP govt. It would be part of a party's behaviour only if it has fought for freedom of the country and for the Constitution.""This is not the first time that seating arrangement at the parade has triggered a controversy. In 2018, Congress objected to seating of Rahul claiming he was given a seat in one of the fourth to sixth row instead of the front row as he was chief of a party. In 2024 I-Day celebrations at Red Fort, controversy again erupted after Rahul was seated in the second-last row with Olympic medalists.Hitting back at Tankha, BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said Congress and Rahul suffer from a sense of entitlement and they believe VVIP treatment for them is more important than the country.Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal was sitting behind Rahul, he added.""Seating arrangement is decided by a set format, which goes by order of precedence,"" he said. He noted Rahul often skipped important official events, I-Day and swearing-in ceremonies of vice president and CJI.BJP recalled their own LoPs Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley used to be given back row seats when Congress-led UPA was in office. At R-Day function in 2009, a veteran politician like L K Advani was seated in the back row, one of them recalled. Poonawalla accused Rahul of insulting North-East by allegedly refusing to wear a 'patka' offered by President Murmu to guests at the 'At Home' reception.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said, ""From the President and the PM to foreign dignitaries, everyone wore the 'patka' with respect and pride. Gandhi alone stood apart, reinforcing a perception of disregard towards North-East..."" Sarma demanded an apology from Rahul.","Congress president mallikarjun kharge and leader of opposition in lok sabha rahul gandhi attended republic day parade and 'at home' reception at rashtrapati bhavan.

GURGAON: A food vendor abducted a 23-year-old woman from Leopard Trail, a popular picnic spot in the Aravalis, shoved her into a borrowed Scorpio and drove around the city with police in pursuit in the early hours of Sunday.The food seller, Gaurav Bhati (25), abandoned the Scorpio and fled when one of its tyres got stuck in mud at Pandala village, around an hour after he had abducted her. Bhati has been arrested and charged with kidnapping and snatching. Police are waiting for the woman's magisterial statement before adding sexual assault charges, sources said.Late on Saturday, the woman and a colleague had driven to Leopard Trail. They reached around 1.30am and spent an hour and a half there. Bhati allegedly harassed the two when they were sitting in their car.When the duo confronted him, an argument started. Amid a heated exchange, Bhati allegedly snatched her phone and began running towards the Scorpio he was driving. When she chased him, he grabbed her and pushed her into the SUV, locked the door and drove off, sources said. Her colleague tried to intervene, but Bhati pushed him away.As Bhati sped away with her, the colleague informed police and shared details of Bhati's vehicle.Police tracked down the SUV using the woman's phone location. Sources said Bhati drove in random directions, going to Southern Peripheral Road, Subhash Chowk and Sector 74, before taking the woman to a secluded, hilly forested area.However, the Scorpio, which Bhati had borrowed from another food vendor, stalled as he drove through mud paths. When she screamed for help, he got off and fled. Police reached the spot and rescued the woman. The Scorpio's registration details took them to its owner, who told them Bhati had taken his car to buy liquor. Three police teams that were formed to trace Bhati arrested him within a few hours, police said.A forensic team visited the area and collected evidence. Location data is being analysed to reconstruct the sequence of events, police said.""A medical examination confirmed that the accused was intoxicated at the time of the crime. When Bhati was taken back to the hills for a recreation of the crime scene, he attempted to escape. During the bid to flee, he tripped and fell in the rugged terrain, resulting in a fracture to his right leg and injuries to the face. He was hospitalised under custody,"" a police officer said.After being discharged, Bhati was produced before a local court and remanded in judicial custody. An FIR was initially registered against him under BNS sections 137(2) (kidnapping) and 304(2) (snatching).Police later added sections related to custodial escape and obstructing a public servant in the discharge of official duties.","Food seller, gaurav bhati (25), abandoned the scorpio and fled when one of its tyres got stuck in mud at pandala village, around an hour after he had abducted her.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Monday slammed Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for allegedly refusing to wear an Assamese 'Gamosa' during the reception hosted by President Draupadi Murmu after Republic Day parade.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma accused the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha of “insulting” the people of the entire Northeast and demanded an unconditional apology from him.Taking to X, Sarma said, “Times may change, but the attitude of the de facto supremo of the Congress party , Mr. Rahul Gandhi, regrettably appears unchanged. In an act that was deeply insensitive and insulting to the people of the entire North East, Mr. Gandhi chose not to wear the traditional Patka, a symbol of the region’s rich cultural heritage, at the reception hosted by the Hon’ble President of India this evening.”“From the President and the Prime Minister to foreign dignitaries, everyone wore the Patka with respect and pride. Mr. Gandhi alone stood apart, reinforcing a perception of disregard towards the North East. Such conduct explains why his party has lost the trust of the region and much of the country. Yet, this repeated insensitivity continues. Rahul Gandhi must issue an unconditional apology to the people of the North East for this affront,” he added.This comes after some media reports claimed that all guests except Rahul wore the Gamosa presented to them at the event.BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said in a post on X, ""Shameful! Rahul Gandhi has insulted the north east and also disrespected our very hon'ble President.""Meanwhile, Congress leaders shared a picture of defence minister Rajnath Singh and asked Assam chief minister if he will demand an apology from Singh also for not wearing the patka.""Hey Himanta Biswa Sarma, will you seek an apology from Rajnath ji too? Or your entire strategy to fight anti incumbency is to pick up such non issues?"" Khera asked,Congress MP Manickam also slammed the BJP over the issue and termed Biswa “2016 batch of betrayer.”""The 2016 batch of betrayer must stop this nonsense. Why is @rajnathsingh ji not wearing the North east patka then? Stop dragging the Hon'ble President @rashtrapatibhvn into your cheap politics,"" Tagore said in a post on X.This comes after he Congress accused the Centre of insulting the Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha -Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge - by seating them in the third row during the Republic Day parade event at Kartavya PathSharing pictures of their leaders seated in the back rows during the ceremony, several Congress leaders raised questions over the ""protocol mess-up"" and propriety.Meanwhile, BJP reacted sharply and accused the grand-old-party of politicising the seating arrangements at the Republic Day and called Gandhi an ""insincere politician"".""Shameful of the Congress to politicise even seating arrangements at Republic Day'.

Does it go against Article 14?

Beyond the rulebook

When the University Grants Commission ( UGC ), the statutory body under the Union education ministry that regulates universities and colleges, notified its Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026, it introduced a new set of rules that will apply across campuses nationwide.The regulations govern how colleges and universities must prevent, identify, and respond to discrimination involving students, teachers, and staff.On paper, the objective sounds straightforward. It seeks to ensure that no student, teacher, or staff member is denied dignity or opportunity in higher education because of identity.In practice, however, the new regulations reach deep into the everyday functioning of campuses, shaping everything from admissions and hostels to classrooms, committees, and corridors.The 2026 framework replaces the UGC’s earlier equity rules and shifts the burden of compliance squarely onto institutions and their leadership.Heads of universities and colleges are no longer just administrators; they are now the first line of accountability in preventing and responding to discrimination. New structures, new reporting mechanisms, and strict timelines are written into the rulebook, backed by the threat of serious penalties for non-compliance.Yet, as has often been the case with regulations aimed at correcting long-standing social inequities, the real questions lie beneath the stated intent.How wide is the definition of discrimination? How much discretion do institutional committees enjoy? What happens when complaints are contested, or when the process itself causes harm? And how prepared are campuses to balance speed, sensitivity, and fairness? And is it discriminatory against the non-reserved General Class students?The objective clause sets the tone for the entire framework. It seeks to eradicate discrimination only on specified grounds like religion, race, caste, gender, place of birth, and disability.The word “only” is significant, as it confines the scope of the regulations to discrimination based on specified identity grounds, excluding general grievances or academic disputes.At the same time, the regulations explicitly prioritise certain groups, including:This prioritisation reflects a remedial approach, focusing on historically disadvantaged communities, while formally keeping the protection available to all stakeholders.The definitions section is one of the most consequential parts of the regulations.“Discrimination” is defined broadly to include not only explicit acts but also implicit, indirect, or structural forms of unfair treatment.It extends to actions that have the effect of impairing equality or violating human dignity, even if discriminatory intent is not overt.“Caste-based discrimination” is defined as discrimination against members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes.Importantly, the regulation does not create separate categories of discrimination for different groups but subsumes them within a common framework.“Equity” is defined as providing a level playing field for all stakeholders with respect to rights and opportunities.Together, these definitions significantly expand the interpretive space available to committees tasked with examining complaints. At the same time, the breadth of these definitions leaves substantial discretion with institutional committees.Terms such as implicit or indirect discrimination, structural unfairness, and impairment of dignity are not further qualified in the regulations, offering limited guidance on thresholds of proof or standards of assessment.This ambiguity may allow flexibility in addressing complex forms of disadvantage, but it also opens the door to uneven interpretation across institutions, particularly in contested cases where intent is disputed or where academic or administrative decisions intersect with allegations of discrimination.Every higher education institution (HEI) is required to establish an Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC). The Centre is tasked with a wide range of functions, including policy implementation, counselling, outreach, awareness-building, and grievance handling.Smaller colleges that lack sufficient faculty strength are allowed to rely on the EOC of their affiliating university, ensuring that the requirement applies uniformly across institutions.The EOC is also expected to coordinate with civil society organisations, local administration, police authorities, and legal services bodies. This expansive mandate reflects an attempt to situate campus equity within a broader social and legal ecosystem.Each Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC) must have an Equity Committee, constituted by the head of the institution. Its composition is carefully structured to include:The regulations mandate representation of women, SCs, STs, OBCs, and persons with disabilities within the committee. The committee is required to meet at least twice a year and to review action taken on complaints.The committee’s core role is to inquire into allegations of discrimination and submit a report with findings and recommendations.Beyond formal committees, the regulations introduce two novel mechanisms: Equity Squads and Equity Ambassadors.Equity Squads are smaller, mobile bodies tasked with maintaining vigilance and visiting “vulnerable spots” on campus. Equity Ambassadors are designated individuals in departments, hostels, libraries, and other units who act as nodal points for reporting violations.These mechanisms signal a shift towards continuous monitoring, rather than complaint-driven intervention alone. While intended as preventive measures, they also raise questions about overreach, informal surveillance, and the potential chilling effect on campus interactions.Every HEI must operate a round-the-clock Equity Helpline. Any stakeholder in distress due to discrimination can access it, and confidentiality of the complainant’s identity must be maintained if requested.Where a prima facie case under penal law is disclosed, the information is to be forwarded to the police. This provision effectively links campus grievance mechanisms with the criminal justice system, raising the stakes for both complainants and the accused.The procedure for handling discrimination complaints is tightly time-bound.An aggrieved person can report an incident through an online portal, email, written complaint, or the helpline. Upon receipt, the Equity Committee must meet within 24 hours to decide on the next steps.The committee has 15 working days to submit its report, after which the head of the institution has seven working days to initiate action. In cases involving the head of the institution, the coordinator of the EOC chairs the inquiry.While the timelines aim to ensure prompt action, they also raise concerns about whether complex allegations can be examined thoroughly within such compressed periods.Any person aggrieved by the Equity Committee’s report can appeal to the Ombudsperson within 30 days. The Ombudsperson may appoint an amicus curiae and is expected to dispose of appeals within another 30 days.This appellate mechanism provides an external check on institutional processes. However, it primarily addresses procedural correctness, rather than offering substantive relief for non-tangible harms such as reputational damage or mental distress.The regulations empower the UGC to monitor compliance through inspections, information requests, and national-level committees. Non-compliant institutions face serious consequences, including:These penalties indicate that equity compliance is not optional, but a condition for institutional legitimacy.Despite the breadth of the framework, the regulations are silent on several issues that are likely to shape their reception and operation on campuses. While they lay out detailed mechanisms for receiving and processing complaints, they do not spell out comparable safeguards for non-reserved individuals who may be accused of discrimination, particularly in cases where allegations are contested or later found to be unsubstantiated.There is no explicit provision dealing with malicious or knowingly false complaints, nor is there any guidance on how institutions should distinguish between bona fide grievances and those driven by personal disputes, academic disagreements, or animosity unrelated to identity-based discrimination. The absence of such clarity places a significant burden on institutional committees to exercise judgment, increasing the risk of inconsistent outcomes across campuses.The regulations also do not acknowledge the mental and reputational impact that the complaint process itself can have on the accused. There are no provisions for interim confidentiality for respondents, counselling support during the inquiry, or mechanisms to repair reputational harm if allegations are ultimately not upheld. In tightly knit academic environments, even the initiation of an inquiry can have lasting professional and psychological consequences, irrespective of the final outcome.Another area of concern relates to timelines. While the emphasis on speed is intended to ensure prompt redressal for complainants, the compressed schedule may limit the ability of committees to examine complex factual disputes, especially those involving academic judgment or administrative discretion. In such cases, the pressure to meet deadlines could inadvertently prioritise procedural closure over substantive fairness.The linkage of campus mechanisms with law enforcement, particularly through the equity helpline, further raises the stakes. While intended to ensure swift action in serious cases, this provision may deter open academic engagement or encourage defensive decision-making by administrators wary of escalation beyond the institution.Historically, similar regulatory frameworks in higher education and other sectors have tended to correct outcomes through appellate or judicial review, while leaving the harms caused during the process largely unaddressed. Appeals may overturn findings or set aside penalties, but they rarely compensate for stress, stigma, or disruption suffered in the interim. In the absence of explicit procedural safeguards, this gap is likely to remain.Taken together, these omissions do not negate the objectives of the regulations, but they point to areas where further clarification or supplementary guidelines may be required. How these concerns are handled, whether through institutional practice, regulatory advisories, or future amendments, will play a key role in determining whether the framework strengthens trust on campuses or becomes a source of sustained friction.Vice-chancellors also said the new framework marks a shift from advisory guidelines to enforceable obligations.The question arises because the regulations draw explicit distinctions by prioritising protections for historically disadvantaged groups, while applying a common framework to all stakeholders.Article 14 guarantees equality before the law, but past judicial practice has allowed differential treatment where it is linked to a legitimate objective and applied through non-arbitrary procedures. In that sense, the regulations are framed as remedial rather than exclusionary, focusing on identity-based disadvantage in higher education.However, concerns stem less from the stated objective and more from the structure of implementation. The wide discretion granted to institutional committees, combined with broadly worded definitions of discrimination and the absence of explicit safeguards for those accused, particularly from the unreserved General Class, has led some to question whether outcomes could vary unevenly across campuses. Critics argue that unequal application, rather than unequal text, could create situations where similarly placed individuals are treated differently in practice.The 2026 equity regulations introduce a far-reaching framework for addressing discrimination and inclusion in higher education, expanding the role of institutional mechanisms and regulatory oversight. They formalise a set of duties, procedures, and enforcement tools that universities and colleges will be required to follow.However, the way the framework functions in practice will depend on how institutions interpret and apply its provisions. The manner in which discretion is exercised, timelines are enforced, and contested complaints are handled will shape whether the regulations operate as intended or generate friction within campuses.","Promotion of equity in higher education institutions regulations, 2026. The regulations govern how colleges and universities must prevent, identify, and respond to discrimination involving students, teachers, and staff. New structures, new reporting mechanisms, and strict timelines are written into the rulebook.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127388943,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-100582,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

KOLKATA: At least seven people were killed and 21 others reported missing after a massive fire tore through a warehouse complex in eastern Kolkata early Monday, trapping workers who had been sleeping inside units packed with flammable materials. The complex housed a decorators' unit and a factory supplying a popular momo chain.Police initially confirmed three deaths, but fire department sources later said seven badly burnt bodies had been retrieved. Identification was not immediately possible. Officials said numbers could change as search continued through smouldering debris.The blaze broke out around 2.30 am at a warehouse in Nazirabad of Anandapur - a densely populated neighbourhood off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, a major arterial road linking south and east Kolkata.According to missing-person complaints, 25 people had stayed overnight inside the decorators' unit, while three others were in the momo factory. Most of those missing are migrant workers from East and West Midnapore districts.Fire officials said the decorators' unit stored large quantities of thermocol and other highly combustible materials. Large stocks of soft drinks and packaged food kept in the warehouse may have further fuelled the flames, allowing the fire to spread rapidly across the structure.Ten fire engines were rushed to the spot, followed by 12 more in phases. Firefighters battled the blaze for hours, but pockets of fire were still burning well into the morning, hampering rescue. A bulldozer was brought in to clear debris. A nearby workers' mess and a residential house were evacuated as a precaution.Relatives of the missing gathered outside the blackened shell of the building, searching for signs of loved ones. Sonarpur resident Pankaj Haldar managed a frantic call to his family after the fire began, but the line went dead soon after, a relative said.""My father has been working here for the past seven years. There is still no news of him. We have found his cycle,"" said Nayan Haldar, standing beside a nearly burnt bicycle believed to belong to his father Basudeb Haldar, store-in-charge of the momo unit.

NEW DELHI: Actress and former Trinamool Congress MP Mimi Chakraborty has lodged a police complaint on Monday alleging harassment during a live stage performance at a cultural programme in West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district.The incident reportedly occurred late Sunday night during an event organised in the Nayagram area of Bongaon town. According to the complaint, one of the organisers allegedly climbed onto the stage mid-performance, stopped the programme abruptly and asked the actress to leave without prior communication.In her complaint to the Bongaon police station, submitted via email, Chakraborty named an organiser, Tanmay Shastri, accusing him of forcibly interrupting her performance and asking her to step down around midnight. She later said the episode left her feeling “deeply humiliated”.The actor also took to the social media platform X to share her account of the incident, linking it to broader concerns around the dignity and safety of women and artists.Referring to the timing of the incident on Republic Day, Chakraborty wrote that while the country speaks of freedom and equality, “the independence and dignity of women and artists are still too easily violated”.Explaining the sequence of events, she said she had been invited by the Naya Gopal Gunj Yubak Sango Club to perform at the event and was asked to leave the stage mid-performance, in full view of the audience.She claimed that derogatory remarks were made on the microphone, which she said not only humiliated her but also damaged her public image. “I left quietly to maintain decorum,” she said, adding that she has now approached legal authorities and believes in due process.“If I keep quiet today, this behaviour will be repeated tomorrow. Dignity on stage is non-negotiable,” Chakraborty said in her post.However, the organisers denied the allegations, saying the programme was stopped due to time restrictions. Shastri claimed the actress arrived nearly an hour late and that police permission for the event was valid only until midnight.He said that the decision to halt the programme was taken keeping in mind upcoming board examinations of students in the area.“Mimi Chakraborty was neither insulted nor harassed, and the allegations made by her are completely baseless,” Shastri said, alleging instead that her security personnel misbehaved with him. He further claimed that the actress’s bodyguards forcibly removed women members of the club who had come on stage to felicitate her.Stating that the organisers had no intention to disrespect the actor, Shastri added that if she felt insulted due to any miscommunication, the club regretted the incident.Police said that the complaint has been taken on record and further investigation into the matter is underway.",Actress mimi chakraborty has lodged a police complaint alleging harassment.

Six Sarpanches Booked in Kamareddy for Mass Killing of Stray Dogs Ahead of Elections

NEW DELHI: In yet another case of alleged mass killings of stray dogs in Telangana, about 200 canines were reportedly killed in Hanamkonda district. This takes the total number of stray dogs found dead in the state since December 2025 to around 1,100, according to animal rights activists.Animal welfare activist A Goutham, associated with the Stray Animal Foundation of India, lodged a complaint with police on Monday, claiming that the 200 stray dogs were brutally killed about a month ago in Pathipaka village of Shayampet mandal by administering poisonous injections.He alleged the act was carried out on the orders of the Gram Panchayat Secretary, news agency PTI reported.Goutham, who works as Cruelty Prevention Manager, said that he visited the village with other activists and spoke to locals, who reportedly confirmed the Panchayat Secretary's involvement.“The carcasses of the dogs were then buried in a graveyard,” he stated, seeking the registration of an FIR.A police official from Shayampet Police Station said the latest complaint has been added to an existing FIR connected to the alleged killing of around 300 stray dogs in Shayampet and Arepally villages.Earlier, nine people, including two women sarpanches and their husbands, were booked in relation to the killings.“Further investigation is ongoing,” the officer added.Several incidents of stray dog killings have been reported across Telangana in January alone. In Pegadapally village of Jagtial district, around 300 dogs were allegedly killed by poisonous injections on January 22.Animal rights activists blamed the village sarpanch and Gram Panchayat Secretary, prompting police to register an FIR under the relevant sections of the BNS and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (PCA) Act.Similarly, in Yacharam village, about 100 stray dogs were allegedly killed on January 19, leading to FIRs against the sarpanch, secretary and ward member of the gram panchayat.Another 200 dogs were reportedly killed in Kamareddy district, with six people, including five village sarpanches, booked for their alleged involvement.Activists have alleged that some elected representatives ordered these killings to fulfil promises made to villagers ahead of the December 2025 gram panchayat elections, aiming to address the stray dog menace.According to background reports, in recent weeks, mass killings of stray dogs have also been reported from Ranga Reddy and other districts, with carcasses often buried in pits. Activists have documented these incidents and continue to demand strict action against those responsible.","About 200 stray dogs reportedly killed in hanamkonda district of telangana.

Protocol and seating norms

BJP hits back

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday accused the Centre of violating established protocol and undermining democratic decorum after Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge were seated in the third row during the Republic Day celebrations. The incident has triggered sharp reactions from senior party leaders.Leading the criticism, Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala questioned whether the seating arrangement met constitutional and institutional norms. In a post on X, Surjewala said the treatment reflected the government’s mindset rather than protocol.“Does such treatment of the Leader of the Opposition in the country meet the standards of any decorum, tradition, and protocol? This only reveals the frustration of a government plagued by an inferiority complex. In a democracy, differences will persist, but this treatment meted out to Shri Rahul Gandhi is unacceptable,” he wrote.Other Congress leaders echoed similar concerns, arguing that the decision diminished the dignity of constitutional offices. Congress MP Manickam Tagore said the issue went beyond seating and reflected the government’s political approach.“Until 2014, opposition leaders like Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley and L K Advani always sat there.This is a very low level of politics by the government. Opposition leaders being insulted on Republic Day is unacceptable. Republic Day is the day when we all should be united and celebrate India's achievements that year,” he said.Tagore also shared an old photograph from the 2014 Republic Day celebrations to question the seating arrangement of opposition leaders this year.In a post on X, he wrote, ""This was in 2014—look at where LK Advani ji was seated then. Why this protocol mess-up now? Is it because Modi and Shah want to insult Kharge ji and Rahul ji? Leaders of the Opposition cannot be insulted like this, especially on Republic Day.""Senior Congress leader Rashid Alvi said both Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge held key constitutional positions and deserved front-row seating.“Rahul Gandhi is the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, and Mallikarjun Kharge is not only the Congress president but also the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha. They should have been given seats in the front row. The BJP is constantly playing with the dignity of Congress leaders,” he said.Congress leader Kumari Selja linked the controversy to a broader disregard for constitutional norms.“Protocols hold great significance. The country takes pride in the Republic Day parade, where we celebrate our democracy and the republic,” she said, alleging that the government repeatedly sought to belittle the office of the Leader of Opposition.The Leaders of Opposition in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha are placed alongside union cabinet ministers in the official Table of Precedence, which governs protocol at national functions such as Republic Day.According to the Warrant of Precedence issued by the President’s Secretariat, seating arrangements at state and ceremonial occasions are decided based on constitutional rank and office and not political affiliation.The Order of Precedence is a protocol list that applies to state and ceremonial occasions, including national events such as the Republic Day celebrations and has no application in the day-to-day functioning of the government.Under Article 7 of the Table of Precedence, the Leaders of Opposition in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha are placed alongside Union Cabinet ministers, after the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Chief Justice of India and former Prime Ministers.Rejecting the Congress’s allegations, the BJP said the seating arrangement at the Republic Day celebrations was decided strictly according to established protocol.BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla, in a post on X, launched a sharp attack on the Congress, accusing it of placing entitlement and family-centric politics above constitutional norms.“Once again Congress puts entitlement & ego, parivar and position above people. They feel parivar tantra is above sanvidhan tantra. Seating is decided by a set format – Warrant or Table of Precedence. One can see even senior Cabinet ministers around or even behind Rahul Gandhi but none of them made it an issue,” Poonawalla wrote.He also questioned Rahul Gandhi’s attendance at major constitutional events in the past.“Rahul thinks he is the owner of India? By the way why does he bunk important programs. Where was he during VP oath? CJI oath? I-Day program?” BJP's national spokesperson further wrote.The BJP has previously criticised Gandhi for skipping the oath-taking of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Vice President CP Radhakrishnan, alleging that such absences showed disregard for constitutional occasions.The party has also flagged Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge’s absence from the Independence Day celebrations at the Red Fort last year, though both leaders had issued Independence Day messages on social media.",Rahul gandhi and mallikarjun kharge were seated in the third row during the republic day celebrations.

"Agri scientists, farmers among Padma winners",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/agri-scientists-farmers-among-padma-winners/articleshow/127584792.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Prominent agriculture scientist Ashok Kumar Singh who developed over 25 rice varieties and former vice-chancellor of the Bihar-based Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University, Gopal Ji Trivedi, are among nine persons associated with farm and allied sector selected for this year's Padma Shri award.Trivedi helped farmers cultivate makhana (fox nuts) in a big way, and popularise this nutrient-dense, low-calorie, and gluten-free snack among health conscious Indians.Besides Singh, former director of the ICAR Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), there are four other scientists and four farmers in the list of awardees who not only helped farm growth through their research and innovative farm practices but also contributed towards improving livelihood of farmers in different parts of the country.Rice varieties including different Pusa Basmati and non-Basmati varieties, developed by Singh and other ICAR-IARI scientists, have significantly increased rice output over the years and helped India earn roughly around Rs 50,000 crore annually from Basmati rice export.On the other hand, the country's first genome-edited rice varieties - 'DRR Dhan 100 (Kamala)' and 'Pusa DST Rice 1' - which Singh co-developed with other scientists of the ICAR's institutes will not only enhance output but also save water and reduce greenhouse gas emission during cultivation.Besides helping farmers cultivate Makhana, the agriculture scientist Trivedi also popularised adoption of canopy management in Litchi orchards to improve yield and promoted winter maize cultivation in Bihar.Other scientists who have been selected for Padma Shri are P L Gautam, former chairperson of the National Biodiversity Authority and the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Authority; K Ramasamy, former vice chancellor of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University; and N Punniamoorthy, former dean at Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University.Four farmers who have been selected for the Padma Shri for their outstanding contributions to agriculture and animal husbandry include Raghupat Singh (posthumous), a progressive farmer from Moradabad district, who conserved more than 55 rare and nearly extinct vegetable varieties and developed around 100 new varieties; Jogesh Deuri of Assam who promoted Muga silk and helped it gain wider national and international recognition; Shrirang Devaba Lad of Maharashtra who developed the ""Dada Lad technique"" for cotton cultivation to increase yield; and Telangana's Rama Reddy Mamidi (posthumous) who strengthened cooperative models in animal husbandry and dairy development.","Nine persons associated with farm and allied sector selected for this year's padma shri award.

DEHRADUN: Close on the heels of a proposal to restrict the entry of non-Hindus at 105 ghats in the Kumbh area at Haridwar, Badrinath Kedarnath Temple Committee (BKTC), which administers the Char Dham shrines of Badrinath, Kedarnath and 47 other temples, is considering a similar move at the shrines under it. The proposal is expected to be placed before BKTC board soon, and has the support of most stakeholders, as per sources.BKTC chairman Hemant Dwivedi told TOI the proposed restriction was rooted in ""long-standing tradition"".""This has been followed since the time of Adi Shankaracharya. We see nothing wrong in preserving religious traditions,"" he said, adding that the ""entry for non-Hindus has historically been restricted at the shrines"".Citing Article 26 of Constitution, which grants religious denominations the right to manage their own affairs, Dwivedi said the committee was well within its rights to take such a decision. Dwivedi also sought to clarify that the term ""non-Hindus"" should not be misconstrued. ""Those who respect our faith are welcome. The dhams are centres of faith, not tourism.""Meanwhile, Uttarakhand govt is weighing a ban on the entry of non-Hindus at 105 ghats across Haridwar and considering declaring Haridwar and Rishikesh as 'sanatan pavitra shehar' (holy cities).

NEW DELHI: RVS Mani, a former officer in the ministry of home affairs (MHA) named for the Padma Shri this Republic Day eve, was instrumental in blowing the lid off the two contradictory affidavits filed by the UPA govt in 2009, under his signature, in the Ishrat Jahan encounter case.While the first affidavit had cited pinpointed inputs by central intelligence agencies establishing Jahan as part of an LeT module tasked to assassinate high-level political functionaries in India, the subsequent affidavit went on to dismiss the evidentiary value of these intelligence inputs and distanced the Centre from Gujarat govt's action based on the inputs.It was several years later that Mani went public, indirectly claiming ""political interference"" to revise the affidavit. Mani owned up to having drafted the first affidavit filed on Aug 6, 2009, based on intelligence reports he had seen and found to be ""precise, accurate and exact"". He said the reports had clear details regarding terror antecedents of the four-member module, comprising Jahan, Javed Shaikh alias Pranesh Pillai, Jishan Johar and Amjad Ali, and laid down the sequence of events leading up to the encounter in Ahmedabad on June 15, 2004, in which all four were neutralised.The original affidavit cited Indian newspaper reports based on the claim made in LeT mouthpiece 'Ghazwa Times' that ""the veil of Ishrat Jahan, a woman activist of LeT, was removed by Indian police and her body kept with other 'mujahideens (terrorists)'"", as a confirmation of her terror links. However, in a subsequent affidavit filed on Sept 29, 2009, MHA said all intel inputs do not constitute conclusive proof and it is for state govt and state police to act on such inputs. It was submitted Centre was in no way concerned with such action and does not condone or endorse any unjustified or excessive action. While the first affidavit said the case was not fit for investigation by CBI, the second said the Centre would not object to an independent inquiry or CBIprobe.Mani had later said the second affidavit was not drafted by him and that he had signed and filed it as he was under orders. According to a statement made in 2016 by then home minister Rajnath Singh in Parliament, the second affidavit (in 2009) was vetted by the then attorney general and approved by the then home minister (P Chidambaram). Notings on the file did not mention any reason for revising the affidavit. Rajnath's statement also cited testimony of 26/11 accused and American LeT operative David Coleman Headley, confirming Jahan as ""a female terrorist"" killed by the Indian police in a botched-up LeT operation.Mani had also said he was ""tortured"" by the chief of SIT when summoned in 2013. Mani has penned several books based on the central theme of political interference in terror investigations, including 'The Myth of Hindu Terror: Insider Account of Ministry of Home Affairs' and 'Deception: A Family that Deceived the Whole Nation'.","Rvs mani, a former officer in the ministry of home affairs (mha) named for the padma shri this republic day eve.

NEW DELHI: Delhi experienced a sharp cold spell on Monday as the minimum temperature dipped to 3.6°C in parts of the city, with isolated cold-wave conditions recorded. Safdarjung, the city's base station, logged 4.2°C - four degrees below normal - making it the coldest Republic Day since 2021, when the capital had witnessed 2.1°C.At the same time, the air quality slipped back to the 'poor' category, ending a rare two-day stretch of moderate AQI in Jan, with the 24-hour average rising to 241 at 4pm from 153 on Sunday, the lowest Jan reading in four years.Ayanagar recorded the city's lowest minimum at 3.6°C, while Ridge logged 5.3°C. The two stations met the criteria of cold wave on Monday.Clear skies and persistent northwesterly winds over the weekend contributed to the drop in temperatures. Wind speeds eased on Monday due to an approaching western disturbance, which is expected to raise the minimum temperature and bring light rain on Tuesday, officials said.IMD has issued a yellow alert for Tuesday, forecasting light to moderate rain and snowfall across the western Himalayan region on Jan 27 and 28.

NEW DELHI: Talks with US-based Purdue University for setting up a campus in India have reached an advanced stage, govt sources said, even as interest from British and Canadian universities gathers pace under India's liberalised foreign education regime. Officials said that colleges under the University of London and several Canadian universities have also conveyed keenness, with preliminary discussions underway.The momentum follows policy changes that have opened India's higher education sector to foreign universities. The National Education Policy, 2020 first articulated the case for allowing top global institutions to operate locally, and this was operationalised in 2023 through UGC regulations. The rules allow eligible foreign universities to establish independent campuses, design curricula and set admission norms, marking a decisive shift from earlier partnership-only models.There are foreign universities already running physical campuses in India - Australia's Deakin University and University of Wollongong at Gujarat's GIFT City, and the UK's University of Southampton in Gurgaon. These campuses offer programmes in high-demand areas such as STEM and management, and have demonstrated that overseas institutions can operate within India's regulatory ecosystem.University of Liverpool, University of York and University of Aberdeen, among others are working towards similar operations.Against this backdrop, Purdue University's proposed India campus is being seen as a major credibility boost for the foreign university policy. Sources said discussions have reached an advanced stage, with talks focused on academic offerings, regulatory compliance and operational frameworks. Govt officials indicated that the plan is for Purdue to offer its flagship engineering and technology programmes in India, allowing students to earn a Purdue degree without having to study overseas.","Talks with us-based purdue university for setting up a campus in india have reached an advanced stage, govt sources said.

"Aggressive low bids put NHAI in a fix, trend may impact quality",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aggressive-low-bids-put-nhai-in-a-fix-trend-may-impact-quality/articleshow/127580065.cms,"ANI file photo

NEW DELHI: Highway construction agencies, including NHAI, are in a bind over the recent trend of road contractors quoting low bids of up to 48% less than the estimated project cost, largely due to aggressive bidding, which usually has a direct bearing on the quality of work.In a recent case, the road transport ministry cancelled a tender for a project in Manipur as the contractor with the lowest bid quoted 47% less than the cost the ministry had estimated. The contractor challenged the bid cancellation in Gauhati high court, and the court ordered an interim stay. ""This case is a classic example of how highway agencies are caught in the middle. Highway contractors are getting projects quoting low bids arguing they have quoted price after carrying out detailed assessment,"" said an official.Data since April 2023 showed that because of less number of projects being offered, there is fierce competition among bidders. For each tender, the number of bidders is in the range of seven to 19.Officials and industry insiders said that while there has been a huge increase in the number of highway contractors in the past 7-8 years, with govt rolling out a large number of projects and also bringing down the qualification criteria, there has been a significant fall in the number of works being bid.""This has resulted in players quoting low bids to ensure that their manpower and machinery do not lie idle, which causes further financial stress. This trend will hurt the sector and quality of work as well since we can't reject a lowest cost or L1 bid in construction works,"" said another official.The details of some of the low quoted bids since 2023-24 showed that a project in Madhya Pradesh - four-laning of Rahatgarh to Berkhedi - was bid out at Rs 324 crore, which was 48.4% less than NHAI's bid cost of Rs 627 crore. In the case of another project in Maharashtra - augmentation of existing stretch in urban areas of Pune on the Pune-Satara section - was bid out at Rs 321 crore, around 46% less than the project cost estimated by the highway authority.Similarly, the work for four-laning from Dareota to Kalar Bala in Himachal Pradesh was tendered at Rs 435 crore against NHAI's project cost of Rs 734 crore this year, which was around 41% less.","Highway construction agencies, including nhai, are in a bind over the recent trend of road contractors quoting low bids.

Congress says Modi government not serious about caste count in Census 2027,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-says-modi-government-not-serious-about-caste-count-in-census-2027/articleshow/127579721.cms,"ANI file photo

NEW DELHI: Congress Monday raised questions about the intent of Modi govt to hold a caste enumeration in Census 2027 as it had announced earlier, pointing out that the question about the caste of the head of a household in the ""houselisting"" phase does not offer ""OBC"" as an option. Govt last week published the gazette notification for ""houselisting"" which is to start in April, and released a list of 33 questions to be asked to households being surveyed.Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh demanded that Modi govt immediately hold talks with political parties, states and civil society organisations before finalising the details of the caste enumeration exercise.Ramesh argued that ""question 12"" for ""houselisting"" asks whether the head of a household belongs to SCs, STs, or 'other' categories, but does not explicitly ask about OBC and general categories.""Since caste enumeration is to be part of Census 2027, 'question 12' as formulated does raise serious questions on Modi govt's true intentions and on its commitment to a comprehensive, fair, nation-wide caste census,"" he said.Ramesh reminded that PM Modi had rejected the demand of caste census raised by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi, even dubbing it ""urban Naxal mindset"". But, he said, Modi govt did a 'U-turn' on April 30 last year, and announced that caste enumeration would be included in Census 2027, adding that PM was ""forced to capitulate"".""Congress calls upon Modi govt to immediately initiate a dialogue with political parties, state govts, and civil society organisations before finalising details of the caste enumeration exercise,"" Ramesh said, adding that such consultations were an integral part of the caste survey that was carried out by the Telangana govt in 2025.","The question about the caste of the head of a household in the ""houselisting"" phase does not offer ""obc"" as an option. Congress spokesperson jairam ramesh demanded that modi govt immediately hold talks with political parties, states and civil society organisations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127579816,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-916613,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
