Sonam Wangchuk's Wife Blasts Modi Govt & CRPF Over 6Th Schedule, Dismisses FCRA, Pak Link Charges

NEW DELHI: Gitanjali Angmo, wife of education reformer and climate activist Sonam Wangchuk on Wednesday in a representation to the President of India Droupadi Murmu sought her intervention and requested for “unconditional release” of Wangchuk, who she said is a “person who can never be a threat to anyone, leave alone his nation”.“A full scale witch hunt has been unleashed for the past one month in particular, and for the past four years covertly, to kill the spirit of my husband and all the causes he stands for and espouses,” Angmo, who is Founder and CEO of the Himalayan Institute of Alternatives Ladakh (HIAL), states in her representation dated October 1.The copies of the representation have also been sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal and LG of Ladakh.She highlights in her representation to the President that since she was informed about her husband’s detention on September 26 under the National Security Act by the Leh police over phone, she still is completely unaware about her husband's condition. ""I am shocked and devastated,"" she added.""Is it a sin to espouse the cause of people and fight against reckless and unchecked development activities in a ecology fragile area of Ladakh, "" she asks.“Is it a crime to speak about climate change, melting glaciers, educational reforms and grassroot innovation? To raise one's voice for upliftment of a backward tribal belt which is ecologically fragile in a peaceful Gandhian manner for the last four years? It certainly cannot be termed as a threat to national security,” Angmo adds.Appealing to the President to intervene, Angmo states, “You being from a tribal community/background, would understand the feelings of the people of Leh Ladakh better than anyone else.""Wangchuk, who has been at the forefront of the movement seeking statehood and extension of the Sixth Schedule to Ladakh, was detained under NSA for allegedly instigating the violent protests on September 24 and later shifted to a jail in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.Meanwhile, Angmo has alleged in her representation that she was put under CRPF surveillance in Village Phyang, where HIAL is also situated. “Students and staff of the Institute were also put under tight surveillance. Two members of the Institute were taken into police custody over the past 3 days, presumably without any authority of law,” Angmo states“Am I not entitled to meet and speak with my husband on phone and in person where ever he is detained? Can I not be of assistance to my husband to know his ground of detention and to espouse his legal rights of seeking justice before the court of law? Am I not entitled to know the condition of my husband who is in detention?,” she asks.“Apart from the illegal detention of my husband, the manner in which the state and its agencies are hounding us and have kept us under surveillance is deplorable. It is violative of the spirit and ethos of the Constitution of India,” Angmo has alleged.She goes on to appeal to the President as the head of the state to “intervene and inject the voice of sanity in an otherwise chaotic state of affairs. As the President of India, you embody the principles of equity, justice and conscience!”","Gitanjali angmo, wife of education reformer and climate activist sonam wangchuk, seeks president's intervention.

HYDERABAD: Telangana HC cleared two cops over the 2003 death of a suspect in an alleged encounter, upholding a sessions court’s decision.Justice Juvvadi Sridevi held there was no credible evidence to sustain the charge of murder: “On the contrary, the material indicates the incident occurred in circumstances of private defence while the cops were discharging their official duties. ”HC dismissed an NGO’s plea challenging exoneration of the cops and confirmed dropping of murder charges. The suspect had allegedly stabbed one of the cops in Zaheerabad, 120km from Hyderabad, snatched his rifle and attempted to open fire. In response, another cop, a sub-inspector, shot the suspect, killing him on the spot.Stressing that concerns about ‘police excess’ must be carefully examined, HC said the facts in this instance did not support allegations of murder.","Telangana hc cleared two cops over the 2003 death of a suspect in an alleged encounter.

Zubeen’s aides booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder

GUWAHATI: Two fugitive prime accused in the probe into Zubeen Garg’s death were arrested before dawn on Wednesday and sent to police custody for 14 days, while the music icon’s 13th-day mourning rituals drew massive crowds in Jorhat, with fans crying for justice.North East India Festival organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta was detained by immigration officers at New Delhi airport around 12.30am after arriving from Singapore on the basis of an Interpol lookout notice, officials said, and handed to Assam police. An hour later, Garg’s manager Siddharth Sharma was caught near the Delhi-Haryana border in Gurgaon.Both were flown to Guwahati, produced before the chief judicial magistrate at the judge’s residence due to Durga Puja court closures, and remanded in police custody for 14 days.Security was tightened at Guwahati airport, along the convoy route, and at the magistrate’s residence, with Assam police and RAF personnel deployed. Photographs released by police showed Mahanta and Sharma in handcuffs inside a police van. DGP Harmeet Singh said: “The investigation is progressing well.”Assam police’s SIT has charged the duo with conspiracy, culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and causing death by negligence.“Interrogation has started and we are going to do everything as per law,” said Munna Prasad Gupta, special DGP (CID) heading the nine-member SIT. He said investigators had seized the two men’s mobile phones along with Garg’s own handset, which was with his manager.Over 60 FIRs have been filed demanding a full probe, 55 of them naming four men: Mahanta; manager Sharma, an employee of a Mumbai-based talent management firm; drummer Shekharjyoti Goswami, and businessman Sanjive Narain.SIT has interrogated Goswami, the singer’s cousin and police officer Sandipon Garg, actress Nishita Goswami, and singer-actress Amritprabha, all of whom were in Singapore at the time. Interpol lookout notices were earlier circulated for Mahanta and Sharma after they ignored SIT summons to appear before Oct 6.Garg’s widow Garima Saikia Garg said in Jorhat she was relieved the duo had been brought to Assam. “We are all waiting to know what happened to him in his last moments,” she said.

NEW DELHI: Chaitanyananda Saraswati, also known as Parthasarathy and the former director of a management institute, is facing multiple allegations of sexual harassment and fraud.In one of the most disturbing exchanges, the 62-year-old reportedly tried to arrange a meeting for a “Dubai Sheikh” seeking a sexual partner.When a student replied that she knew no one suitable, Saraswati pressed further, asking, “How it’s possible?” and inquiring if any of her classmates or juniors could help.Other messages suggest he addressed a victim in infantilising terms, such as “Sweetie Baby Daughter Doll,” and reportedly sent obsessive messages throughout the day and late into the night.Police say these chats are part of a broader investigation into Saraswati, who is accused of harassing multiple female students at a private institute.Investigators are examining the full extent of his alleged predatory behaviour.During the investigation, police also found a CCTV monitoring app on Chaitanyananda Saraswati’s phone, which he allegedly used to access the ashram’s security cameras remotely.Authorities questioned three women, including the institute’s dean and two wardens.“He has been continuously misleading us, but we confronted Chaitanyananda with evidence,” an officer said.

High court calls wife’s killing ‘classic case of blind faith’

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad high court has convicted an elderly man and an accomplice of strangling his wife to death in 1982 under the pretext of “driving out a ghost”, calling it a shocking case of blind faith used as a cover for murder After a 43-year-long legal battle, a division bench of Justices Rajiv Gupta and Harvir Singh sentenced Awadhesh Kumar, 71, and co-accused Mata Prasad to life imprisonment, overturning a 1984 trial court acquittal.The court also handed them three-year sentences under IPC Section 201 for destroying evidence, saying both terms would run concurrently. Two other accused died while the appeal filed by UP govt was pending.Prosecutors said Kumar killed his 23-year-old wife Kusuma Devi on Aug 6, 1982, after being caught in an illicit relationship with his younger brother’s wife.Kumar, who was then 28 years old, Prasad and two others pinned Kusuma down and throttled her, claiming they were exorcising a ghost.Her body was cremated in a hurry that same night to conceal the crime, according to witness testimony.Calling it “a classic case of blind faith”, the HC said: “Such unfortunate realities are still prevalent in remote areas in different cultures based on superstition and belief, just to bring good fortune and to appease the gods. This shocks the conscience of civilized society and is to be condemned by one and all, to curb such social evils.”Awadhesh Kumar and co-accused Mata Prasad have been ordered to surrender within two weeks.

'Resilient Despite Attempts To Crush It': PM Modi Praises RSS' Unbroken Spirit And Service

Illegal immigration threat to India’s demography: PM

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday praised the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ’s campaign against caste discrimination and untouchability, highlighting RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat ’s call for shared temples, wells and cremation grounds.“The Sangh has continuously fought against untouchability and social discrimination. Mahatma Gandhi also openly praised the Sangh’s equality and fraternity,” said Modi while speaking at an event to commemorate Sangh’s centenary celebrations.In his speech marked by a tough pitch against infiltration, Modi emphasised that successive RSS chiefs have campaigned against caste discrimination. “Na Hindu patito bhavet (No Hindu can ever be fallen),” he quoted the second Sarsanghchalak as saying.Modi also cited the third Sarsanghchalak’s statement, “If Hindu untouchability is not wrong, nothing else is wrong in the world”, and referred to Bhagwat’s statement that no Hindu can be barred from accessing temples, wells and cremation grounds used by others.Modi said these ideals represented the Sangh’s effort to eliminate internal divisions and strengthen national unity. “No discrimination, no differences of opinion, no alienation of hearts — this is the basis of harmony,” he added.The reference to RSS’s stand against untouchability is significant in view of efforts of its ideological opponents to frame the organisation as a Brahmanical outfit. He also sought to rebut the allegation about Sangh’s aloofness from the freedom struggle by saying that its founder KB Hedgewar was jailed several times by the British authorities, while its workers supported and provided protection to freedom fighters.The PM doubled down on his stand against infiltration and warned that illegal immigration posed a grave threat to India’s demography and internal security. He also tied the Sangh’s message of social equality to the broader challenges facing India and underlined that the RSS’s social reform initiatives were inseparable from its nationalist credentials, pointing to the participation of its early leaders and volunteers in the freedom struggle.Many RSS workers faced British repression during the 1942 Quit India upsurge and the Chimur agitation, he said. “From the fight against the Nizam’s oppression in Hyderabad to the liberation of Goa, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, the Sangh made many sacrifices,” Modi said, situating the organisation within the broader sweep of India’s anti-colonial and post-Independence struggles.",Pm narendra modi praised the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh’s campaign against caste discrimination and untouchability.

Better & safer

NEW DELHI: Aimed at eliminating men, vehicle and animal conflict in Kaziranga National Park (KNP), the Cabinet Wednesday approved widening and improvement of 86-km Kalibor-Numaligarh section of NH-715 in Assam, including three elevated sections of 34.5 km through the national park.The Rs 6,957 crore project will be fully funded by govt. Once the elevated section is built, the existing two-lane highway passing through the KNP will be abandoned. The existing road will be part of the national park, thereby ensuring unhindered movement of animals.Sharing the Cabinet decision with reporters, I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the project will decongest the existing corridor, improve safety, and necessary provisions have been made in consultation with entities, including National Tiger Conservation Authority and Wildlife Institute of India to prevent any harm to animals.Terming it as a historic decision for Assam and the northeast in a post on X, PM Modi said, “The Cabinet decision on widening and upgradation of the Kalibor–Numaligarh section of NH-715, including an elevated corridor with wildlife-friendly measures in the Kaziranga stretch, will boost development as well as ensure animal safety. Tourism to Kaziranga will receive a big boost.”Sources said the plan to expand the road and building elevated stretch had been in works since 2016, but it gained momentum after NHAI took up the stretch in 2023.Govt said a major part of the existing highway passes either through the national park or along the southern boundary of the park having only 16 to 32 metres of right of way. “During monsoons, the area inside the park gets flooded leading to the movement of the wildlife from the park towards the elevated Karbi-Anglong Hills by crossing the existing highway. The heavy round-the-clock traffic on the highway results in frequent accidents and deaths of wild animals,” it added.","The rs 6,957 crore project will be fully funded by govt.

'Goldification': Akhilesh Yadav hits out at Centre as gold prices cross Rs 1 lakh; accuses BJP of hoarding black money,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/goldification-akhilesh-yadav-hits-out-at-centre-as-gold-prices-cross-rs-1-lakh-accuses-bjp-of-hoarding-black-money/articleshow/124256516.cms,"Akhilesh Yadav (ANI image)

Akhilesh Yadav's X post

NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party president and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav has accused the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of hoarding gold and converting “black money into solid assets,” a process he described as goldification.Yadav alleged that the recent surge in gold prices is not the result of rising demand among ordinary citizens but due to what he called large-scale hoarding by BJP leaders. He argued that under the “goldification” process, corrupt members of the ruling party are turning their illicit funds into precious metals.In a post on X, Yadav wrote: “The reason for the skyrocketing gold prices in BJP rule is not an increase in demand for gold among the common people; rather, the cause is the ‘goldification’ process by which the highly corrupt BJP members are converting their liquid black money into solid assets.”The SP leader further questioned whether the BJP’s “iron double engine” had in fact “turned into gold,” while demanding that the government explain why prices of luxury metals continue to rise despite international market fluctuations.He also mocked the ruling party, asking whether its much-publicised drones, binoculars and bulldozers were only meant for political opponents and not for tracking gold hoarders.According to Yadav, the soaring cost of gold has pushed even silver out of reach for the poor, depriving them of traditional practices such as gifting ornaments during weddings.“Now a poor man cannot even give a single gold clove to his loved ones as a blessing during weddings,” he said.Gold prices in Delhi touched Rs 1,18,790 per 10 grams (24K) today, compared to Rs 1,17,561 per 10 grams on Tuesday. Prices of the precious metal tend to fluctuate daily, influenced by global factors such as dollar movements and international demand, along with domestic taxes and seasonal buying trends.","Akhilesh yadav accuses the ruling party of hoarding gold and converting “black money into solid assets,” a process he described as goldification.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) will finally get its long-awaited second airport — which will eventually overtake the existing Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Int’l Airport (CSMIA) in traffic handling capacity — this month. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) on Oct 8.Ahead of the inauguration, Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani visited the project site for a comprehensive review and walkthrough of the final preparations. “Every runway, every terminal, every gate here carries the imprint of thousands of hands and hearts. This is more than an airport — it is a monument to the spirit of Bharat, built by its people, for its people,” Gautam Adani said.During his visit, the Adani Group chairman undertook a detailed inspection of the airport, which, once fully operational, will have the capacity to handle 9 crore passengers annually — placing it among the largest and most advanced airports in the world. Apart from assessing technical progress and operational readiness, Adani interacted with construction workers to understand their journeys, met engineers and project teams, engaged with firefighting staff to acknowledge their critical role in safety, and spent time with differently-abled staff at one of the terminal’s retail outlets.Flights will start at NMIA a week to 15 days after getting inaugurated. Starting with 60 daily flights (30 arrivals and as many departures) in the first month, the number will double after 30 days and then reach the 240-300 mark in six months.In its first phase with a capacity of 2 crore passengers annually (CPA), the greenfield airport will handle 400 daily flights which it will ramp up to in a year, Adani Group director (airports) Jeet Adani had recently told TOI in an exclusive interaction.“We aim to have both domestic and international operations at NMIA from Day One itself. If that does not happen for some reason, both will start for sure within the same month (Oct). The ratio of domestic and international flights will be 4:1 as T1 domestic capacity is 1.7 CPA and int’l is 30 lakh per annum. We have the flexibility to increase international passengers, based on demand,” Jeet, son of group patriarch Gautam Adani, had said.While in its initial days connectivity may be an issue, eventually NMIA will be the “most well connected” airport of India with a network of roads, rail, metro, air taxis and water connectivity. An aerocity is being developed here that will, among other things, have hotels in all ranges from budget to luxury.","Prime minister narendra modi will inaugurate the navi mumbai international airport (nmia) on oct 8.

NEW DELHI: On former Union minister P Chidambaram’s statement that foreign pressure restrained the Manmohan Singh-led govt from retaliating against Pakistan after the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai, Congress fumctionary Rashid Alvi has questioned why Chidambaram made the claim after all these years and if it implied that he had acted under US pressure.“Such a statement will only benefit BJP.
