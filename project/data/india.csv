Will permanently close cough syrup unit: TN minister

CHENNAI/BHOPAL/NAGPUR: The adulterated cough syrup death toll rose to 23 after two more children died of renal failure Thursday, while police arrested Govindan Ranganathan (75), the owner of Tamil Nadu-based Sresan Pharmaceuticals, which manufactured the Coldrif medicine.The latest victims - Garvik Pawar and Mayank Suryawanshi, both between one and two years old and residents of Umreth tehsil in MP's Chhindwara district - died at GMCH in Nagpur. Doctors said they had suffered acute kidney failure and brain damage after taking the syrup laced with DEG, an industrial solvent used in brake fluids.Chhindwara accounts for 20 deaths, all recorded within 45 days. Ten children died at GMCH Nagpur, others in nearby hospitals.The deaths sparked a political blame game. While MP's BJP CM Mohan Yadav said DMK-led TN govt should explain how it renewed Sresan's licence, TN health minister Ma Subramanian said, ""Centre and MP govt had cleared the drug, but we alerted them.""Ranganathan was arrested from his residence in Chennai by a seven-member MP SIT. His manager Jayaraman and lab assistant Maheswari were also picked up. All three were presented before a Chennai court, which issued a transit warrant for their transfer to Chhindwara.Police have seized 589 bottles of Coldrif syrup in Chhindwara and 1,534 bottles statewide. Tests of Batch SR-13 by Tamil Nadu's drug control laboratory confirmed dangerous levels of DEG, prompting suspension of Sresan's manufacturing licence and sealing of its facility at Sunguvarchatram in TN's Kanchipuram district.SIT had been camping in TN for days. Ranganathan was on the run with his wife since the tragedy broke. He carried a Rs 20,000 reward. He faces charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, drug adulteration, and violations of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.TN health minister Ma Subramanian said the state found the presence of DEG and ordered criminal action against the firm. ""Centre and MP govt had cleared the drug, but we alerted them. We will permanently close the unit within days,"" he said. The minister also suspended two senior drug inspectors - Deepa Joseph and K Karthikeyan - for failing to inspect Sresan's plant as required under law. An internal audit had flagged 364 critical and major lapses across the drug's manufacturing chain - from sourcing and testing to packing.MP CM Mohan Yadav vowed to ""bring to justice the accused who killed the kids"", while accusing TN of dragging its feet. ""End-to-end responsibility lies with the manufacturer. We have sacked our drug controller and assistant drug controller for negligence, but TN govt should explain how it renewed the licence of a company that mixed poisonous brake-fluid chemicals into cough syrup,"" Yadav said in Nagpur after visiting the victims' families.The CM said the wife of the doctor in Chhindwara's Parasia, who prescribed the syrup, owned a pharmacy. This prompted disciplinary action. ""It is confirmed all the children died after taking the poisonous syrup. We're providing financial aid to the families,"" Yadav said.Opposition Congress's Kamal Nath, a nine-time MP from Chhindwara, accused BJP govt of ""deliberately weakening"" the case. ""Despite such a large number of deaths, the investigation report does not state the syrup was poisonous. By manipulating the lab findings, who is the govt trying to protect?"" he said. Congress workers held a candlelight vigil in Bhopal, demanding the resignation of deputy CM Rajendra Shukla, who heads the health department, and justice for the children killed by the toxic syrup.(Inputs from P Naveen & Suchandana Gupta in Bhopal, Sarfaraz Ahmed in Nagpur, Sindhu Kannan & Pushpa Narayan in Chennai)","Two more children die of renal failure after taking the syrup laced with deg, an industrial solvent used in brake fluids.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Thursday filled a 75-year-old constitutional vacuum that caused serious heartburn among judicial service officers, who took 15-20 years to become district judges through promotions and were left behind in career progression by advocates who with just seven years experience could become district judges through direct recruitment.A five-judge bench of CJI B R Gavai, M M Sundresh, Arvind Kumar, S C Sharma and K V Chandran interpreted Article 233 of Constitution, which was silent on the experience of career judicial officers to get promoted as district judges, to provide a uniform criteria of seven years experience for both trial judges and advocates to make them eligible to compete for the posts.CJI Gavai said, ""A person who has been or who is in judicial service and has a combined experience of seven years or more as an advocate or a judicial officer would be eligible for being considered and appointed as a district judge/additional district judge under Article 233 of Constitution."" Referring to the Shetty Commission recommendations, SC rejected the plea that permitting young trial judges with seven years combined experience as advocate and judicial officer would make them leapfrog over senior judicial officers who preferred the promotion chain to reach the post.The CJI said, ""If a person is meritorious and on account of merit alone gets selected directly as a district judge, there can be no question of heartburn for those who are not as meritorious..."" Supreme Court provided an uniform eligibility age of 35 years for both advocates and judicial officers.

₹1.8 lakh as redemption fine

Poll Should customs authorities provide clearer guidelines for classifying personal vs. commercial items? Yes, clearer guidelines are needed No, current rules are sufficient

What the court said



The outcome



Why the judgment matters



The broader context



The takeaway



A single high-value product does not automatically mean commercial intent.

Declaration rules must still be followed — non-declaration can attract penalties.

Customs authorities must base decisions on context and evidence, not assumptions.





On March 7, 2024, Mahesh Malkani, an Indian citizen living in Dubai, arrived at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport wearing a Rolex Submariner worth around AED 56,000 (approximately ₹12.7 lakh). Believing he had nothing dutiable to declare, Malkani passed through the Green Channel — reserved for passengers without goods requiring customs declaration.Customs officers, however, intercepted him, seized the watch, and issued a detention receipt. Officials claimed that Malkani had used the wrong channel and violated baggage rules. They further classified the single watch as a “commercial quantity,” implying it was intended for trade rather than personal use.Following the seizure, the Commissioner of Customs at IGI Airport issued an Order-in-Original on January 30, 2025. The order allowed Malkani to redeem the Rolex watch for re-export upon payment of the following:The order required Malkani to complete the redemption within 120 days. Instead of paying, he moved the Delhi High Court , challenging both the classification of the watch as “commercial” and the penalty terms.A Division Bench of Justices Pratibha M. Singh and Sahil Jain heard the case and delivered judgment on September 17, 2025.The High Court upheld the customs department’s right to impose a redemption fine and penalty but disagreed with the classification of the Rolex as a commercial consignment. The judges observed: “Clearly, this Court is of the view that one Rolex watch cannot be held to be a commercial quantity, and there is no reason why the same cannot be kept for personal use.”The bench noted that wearing a high-value watch during international travel does not, by itself, justify treating it as a commercial import. It emphasised that customs officials must take a practical view when distinguishing between personal and commercial use.While the court did not waive the fines or penalties, it extended the redemption deadline to October 31, 2025, thereby allowing Malkani additional time to reclaim his watch. The judgment effectively clears him to retrieve the Rolex after payment, while also reaffirming that the mere possession of an expensive personal item cannot automatically be equated with commercial intent.The High Court also strongly urged customs authorities to avoid arbitrary classifications in future cases, warning that such broad, blanket assumptions may not stand up to thorough judicial scrutiny.The decision clarifies an important grey area in customs enforcement: value alone cannot determine intent. A single high-end item, such as a luxury watch or jewellery, may still qualify as a personal belonging if it is clearly meant for personal use.Legal experts have welcomed the ruling as a sensible interpretation of customs law. Supreme Court advocate Dr. Sujay Kantawala said the judgment “underscores that customs must take a practical view of what counts as personal use versus commercial quantity.”The case also reflects broader judicial concern over how customs officers apply baggage rules, especially to international passengers carrying high-value personal goods.Under Indian customs regulations, travellers arriving from abroad are allowed to carry personal items and gifts up to a certain value without paying duty — currently around ₹45,000 (approximately AED 2,000). Anything beyond that must be declared at the Red Channel.Failure to do so can lead to detention, hefty fines, or confiscation, even if the items are clearly personal. Over the past year, courts have repeatedly reminded customs officials to exercise discretion, particularly when dealing with worn items such as watches or jewellery that are clearly intended for personal use.The Delhi High Court’s ruling sets a precedent for future customs disputes involving luxury items. It makes clear that:For travellers, the message is equally clear: when in doubt, declare. For customs, the case is a reminder that practicality and fairness must guide enforcement — not just the price tag on someone’s wrist.","Delhi high court rules single rolex watch worn by dubai resident is for personal use, not commercial import.

Departments have also been advised to create a pool of academically outstanding final-year law students, who can assist with legal research, drafting, and other aspects of litigation.Officials said that the PM urged all department heads to reduce litigations and also to draft legislations in easy to understand and simple language for convenience of citizens. The meeting had lasted for more than two hours where different secretaries had made their observations and suggestion.TOI has learnt that taking forward his swadeshi pitch and to reduce imports, Modi asked secretaries to interact with domestic manufacturers to identify products that can be produced domestically and that the departments should handhold those industries to facilitate efficient manufacturing of the identified products locally. They have also been asked to explore the possibility of having panels of accredited third party assessors and auditors under Quality Council of India for certifying the quality of products and processes to promote trust and quality. They have been asked to see that these arrangements align with international norms for accreditation.The PM has also asked departments to encourage researchers and manufacturers in defence sector to use their technologies for commercial manufacturing of products for civilian use and to promote ecosystem for indigenous development of public digital and social media platforms.The PM has also asked the ministries and departments to have a ""whole of government"" approach in implementing initiatives, policies and schemes which involve participation of multiple departments, meaning that departments should not focus on their narrow area of work but look at the larger national perspective.","Ministries and departments have been directed to put a ""ceiling"" on the number of court cases that can be filed.

NEW DELHI: In a surprise move, Arvind Kejriwal 's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has announced that it will contest all 243 seats in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections, positioning itself as an alternative to both the ruling NDA and the opposition Mahagathbandhan. The decision has added an interesting variable as strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor ’s Jan Suraaj also debuts this time in what the Election Commission has called the ""mother of elections.""Party leaders said AAP aims to introduce its ""Delhi-Punjab model"" of governance in Bihar, focusing on education, healthcare and anti-corruption measures. The leadership believes widespread public frustration with unemployment, migration and poor infrastructure has created space for a new brand of issue-based politics in the state.""We have an approved model of growth and governance. The work done by the Aam Aadmi Party is being discussed across the country. People hailing from the Purvanchal region had contributed immensely to our victory in Delhi,"" AAP's state in-charge Ajesh Yadav said while announcing the decision.""Our national convener Arvind Kejriwal asked if they can help us form a government in Delhi, then why not in Bihar?"" he added.AAP’s move comes at a time when the opposition bloc - RJD, Congress, and Left parties - is struggling to finalise a seat-sharing formula ahead of the polls. The AAP, which earlier announced its decision to part ways from INDIA bloc in July, shortly after Delhi election debacle, has again chosen to chart an independent course in Bihar.Kejriwal's move is being widely seen as a response to the rise of Prashant Kishor, who has visited almost every corner of Bihar with an aim of grassroot expansion in the last couple of years. Prashant Kishor is promising an alternative to the traditional contest between the BJP-JD(U) and RJD-Congress that heavily depends on caste politics.AAP MP Sanjay Singh explained this: ""We have already delivered on the ground, but Prashant Kishore is making promises only. Making promises and actually implementing them on the ground are two very different things,"" Singh said.Interestingly, Prashant Kishor, as a strategist, played a pivotal role in AAP's success, especially in Delhi. His I-PAC collaborated closely with AAP charting out campaign strategies that helped AAP win massive once again in 2020.The timing of this bet also seems to be perfect for Kejriwal, and Prashant Kishor, as with nearly two decades of Nitish Kumar-led governance, political fatigue seems to have set in among voters, creating what some see as an opportune moment for a third front. It's a formula that once worked for Kejriwal in Delhi where AAP dethroned Congress mired in corruption and anti-incumbency.The same story was repeated in Punjab where AAP defeated the two traditional parties of Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal that had ruled the state for seven decades. AAP was seen as a party offering a fresh, corruption-free alternative, building on its reputation for delivering welfare policies and good governance in Delhi.In Bihar, Kishor has been attempting a similar style of politics, and now Kejriwal’s party has entered the fray, vying for the same space. But will Kejriwal's party succeed in making inroads in a state like Bihar or will it just vanish in thin air? We will not have to wait long to know, as the state votes in two phases on November 6 and 11. The decision will be known on November 14 when the election result is announced.",The aam aadmi party (aap) has announced that it will contest all 243 seats in the upcoming bihar assembly elections.

When Bhushan said veracity of the affidavits can be inquired into, the bench said, ""After experiencing such false affidavits, how can we trust these? We are not in the business of conducting inquiry.""""We would have been with you had you given details of persons whose names have been deleted without intimation from the final voter list and whether their appeals have been disposed of without proper hearing. We could have intervened. Why not a single instance cited by you? It seems there is too much passion and little reason,"" the bench told ADR's counsel.However, the bench ensured that no name is deleted from the voters' list without following procedure and directed DLSA to deploy para-legal volunteers to inquire from booth level officers about the persons whose names figure in the deletion list of 3.75 lakh, which is in addition to 65 lakh, and facilitate them in filing an appeal against deletion.On EC's charge that the affidavit contained false information amounting to perjury, Bhushan said, ""It was given to me by a responsible person. If EC is having a problem with it, the court can direct legal services authorities to inquire into it.""Justice Bagchi said, ""EC has demonstrated that the facts are incorrect. If the person who has filed the affidavit is not found at the address given, how would legal services authority inquire into it. Inquiry does not rectify falsehood."" EC, through senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, said once the allegation is found to be false, the NGO would now change the narrative. ""Their aim is to create a narrative through analysis based on wrong data,"" he said.Social activist Yogendra Yadav took over from Bhushan and alleged that the SIR of Bihar's electoral rolls has been weaponised to exclude a large chunk of voters, especially women. He said because of SIR, around 80 lakh voters have been deleted from the list. Based on data and graphics presented by him, the bench said till 2023, the number of voters in Bihar exceeded the total adult population. When Yadav said it was a problem which was cured subsequently, the bench said, ""If it (total number of voters ) was 105% of total adult population, it is a crisis not a problem. ""Yadav said there are still several lakh voters with the same name and same address. EC should employ software to delete duplicate names from the final voter list, he said, which invited sarcastic comments from Dwivedi, who said, ""Till now they were seeking inclusion.

The two have alleged that Priya usurped their father's assets by presenting a forged will.During the hearing of a suit challenging division of Sunjay's assets, reportedly worth Rs 30,000 crore, senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for Samaira and Kiaan Raj, said: ""She (Priya) has made these children the cynosure of every kidnapper's dream. She has put them in danger by disclosing how much they get from the assets. Who is really greedy? She is getting 60% of the assets and 75% of the trust. She is no benign stepmother but Cinderella's stepmom. ""Jethmalani alleged before a bench of Justice Jyoti Singh that Priya was in a ""glaring hurry"" to restrict the children's share, and carried out a ""clumsy forgery"" of the will. He claimed there was ""enough evidence"" to probe the forgery, and sought a status quo on the movement of Sunjay's assets. ""She (Priya) is a nominee, and she holds the assets.How far the forgery of documents goes will have to be unravelled - there is enough evidence to conduct a probe,"" he added.Questioning the authenticity of the will presented by Priya, Jethmalani further claimed that Sunjay did not consult a lawyer while making it. ""Sunjay's digital footprints are nowhere; the digital footprints are there of the conspirators to a serious crime, which is forgery of a will,"" the senior lawyer argued, pointing out that the will's executor got it just one day before its reading.He alleged that the will was modified when Sunjay was on a holiday with his son, adding that those who forged the document got rewarded.HC will resume hearing the matter on Oct 13. The court last month asked Priya to furnish a list of his assets and allowed her to file it in a sealed cover, even as she questioned the claim filed by the two children.

The initiative is expected to benefit over 50 lakh women in the state, and the policy is likely to be notified soon.CM Siddaramaiah described the policy as a step toward creating a more humane, understanding, and inclusive workplace. With this move, Karnataka joins Bihar and Odisha in granting menstrual leave to women employees. While Bihar restricts the benefit to women government staff (two days per month), Odisha offers 12 such leaves annually to women employees across all sectors.Law Commission of Karnataka drafted the Karnataka Menstrual Leave and Hygiene Bill, 2025, proposing 12 days of leave for working women and two days every month for students. Of the 75 stakeholder responses received, 56 supported the move. The draft prescribes a fine of up to Rs 5,000 for employers who deny leave or discriminate against menstruating employees.According to the government's Periodic Labour Force Survey, Karnataka has one of the highest female labour force participation rates in the country, at 31.5%. Bengaluru, with a population of 14 million, is home to thousands of startups and MNCs such as Walmart and Google , as well as major Indian tech firms like Infosys and Wipro Labour minister Santosh Lad said the policy had been worked out over the past year. ""Women shoulder multiple responsibilities, from household chores to caring for children. During menstruation, they experience physical and mental stress. A committee had recommended six days of leave annually, but the government decided to grant 12 days of paid leave annually,"" he added.","Karnataka approves 12 menstrual leaves a year across sectors - including government offices, garment factories, it firms, mncs, and private industrial units.

"SC: There's no age bar for having kids or adoption, then why for surrogacy?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-theres-no-age-bar-for-having-kids-or-adoption-then-why-for-surrogacy/articleshow/124441445.cms,"SC: Not for state to question couple's ability to parent kids

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that an age bar on aspiring parents under the surrogacy law cannot be enforced retrospectively, and those who froze their embryos before commencement of the law, that is Jan 25, 2022, would be allowed to go for surrogacy irrespective of their age. It also raised questions over the rationality behind the age restrictions when there is no age bar for procreation or adoption.The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act sets age limits for intending parents and surrogate mothers. It says the intending mother must be between 23 and 50 years, and the intending father between 26 and 55. The surrogate mother must be married and be between 25 and 35 years, have a biological child, and act as a surrogate only once in her lifetime. It allows single women (widowed or divorced) between 35 and 45 to pursue surrogacy.The bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan rejected the plea of Centre justifying the restrictions on the ground that children born out of surrogacy would not be cared for properly if the intending mother and father, one or both, are above the prescribed age-limit(s) under the Act.""In the present case, the parenting capabilities of the couple are being used to assail their eligibility to have children through surrogacy...It is not for the State to question the couple's ability to parent children after they had begun the exercise of surrogacy when there were no restrictions on them to do so,"" the bench said.The bench allowed the plea of three couples who are in their 50s and 60s and had frozen their embryos before 2022. They moved SC after the authority under the law refused to permit them to move to the next step in the surrogacy process. Giving a ray of hope to all similarly placed couples, the court said they can approach HCs for similar relief.It also clarified that it was not questioning the wisdom of Parliament on its prescription of age limits under the Act, and the issue before it was limited to couples who had commenced the surrogacy process before the enforcement of the Act. Petitions challenging the age bar are already pending before SC.""Thus, prior to the enforcement of the Act, the right to pursue surrogacy despite one's age did not impinge on any of the above considerations and was solely in the decision-making domain of the intending couple. It was a personal decision, with personal consequences. Although the Union of India has argued that age-limits are directly related to the welfare of children, as explained above, we are unable to accept this submission in view of the unlimited freedom afforded to couples who wish to conceive children naturally, irrespective of their age,"" the bench said.""Thus, if an intending couple had - (i) commenced the surrogacy procedure prior to the commencement of the Act; (ii) were at the stage of creation of embryos and freezing after extraction of gametes; (iii) and on the threshold of transfer of embryos to the uterus of the surrogate mother, the age restriction under Section 4(iii)(c)(I) of the Act would not apply,"" the court said.Centre had taken the stand that the law should be applied retrospectively due to concerns over the declining quality of gametes with age and the potential impact of the same on children born through surrogacy.Rejecting it, SC said, ""On the basis of concerns over gamete quality, the law does not fetter couples who wish to bear children naturally. Moreover, there is no age bar for couples who wish to adopt children under the provisions of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956, which personal law applies to the intending couples herein.""",The surrogacy (regulation) act sets age limits for intending parents and surrogate mothers.

Rajasthan anti-conversion law comes into force,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rajasthan-anti-conversion-law-comes-into-force/articleshow/124441417.cms,"JAIPUR: Governor Haribhau Bagde Wednesday granted assent to Rajasthan Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Act, 2025, passed by the state Assembly in Sept this year. Law minister Jogaram Patel said the Act had now also been notified.Putting an end to the traditional notion of 'chat mangni-pat byaah (prompt wedding)', the new law mandates that priests or clerics inform the district administration of inter-religious weddings they are about to officiate over, at least two months in advance. The law also says individuals getting married must inform the district magistrate at least three months in advance.Failure to adhere to these mandates will lead to penalties for ""forced conversions"", including imprisonment of 7 to 14 years and fines starting at Rs 5 lakh. Penalties escalate significantly if the victim is from a protected group, such as women, minors, Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes, with jail terms of up to 20 years and fines of at least Rs 10 lakh. Mass conversions could result in life imprisonment and fines not less than Rs 25 lakh.The Act stipulates that all offences will be non-bailable and will be tried exclusively in a sessions court, with repeat offenders facing life sentences and fines of up to Rs 50 lakh.Additionally, marriages conducted solely for conversion purposes will be deemed void.This was Rajasthan govt's second attempt at passing the anti-conversion law. An earlier legislation passed in 2008 when Vasundhara Raje was chief minister could not be enacted as it was returned by then President Pratibha Patil.
