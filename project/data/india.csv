Portuguese-era case resolved by Supreme Court 78 yrs after Independence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/portuguese-era-case-resolved-by-supreme-court-78-yrs-after-independence/articleshow/124102488.cms,"NEW DELHI: After half a century and several rounds of litigation, Supreme Court approved on Wednesday an April 30, 1974, decision of the collector of Dadra and Nagar Haveli to rescind the erstwhile Portuguese govt’s grant of possession rights over land to Indians for cultivation.What rankled a bench of Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and N K Singh was that even after 78 years of Independence the highest court is engaged in resolving disputes relating to rights conferred by colonial powers, which exploited India’s wealth and resources.Dadra and Nagar Haveli was liberated from Portuguese occupation in 1954 and was integrated with India in 1961 as a Union Territory.Certain persons were granted inheritable possession rights over vast tracts of land in Dadra and Nagar Haveli by Portuguese govt for an indefinite period, subject to payment of annual rent. Over a century, these landowners’ progeny have divided these lands between them.Indian govt in 1969 rescinded the lands allotted by Portuguese govt and reverted these to administration. These were challenged before Bombay HC.During pendency, D&N Land Reforms Regulation, 1971, was brought in, which stipulated that land allotted by Portuguese govt to persons should have been cultivated regularly.The collector found the land uncultivated and took back the land by an order of April 30, 1974.This was challenged in the trial court by heirs of people who were given possession of land. Trial court quashed the collector’s order in June 1978.Govt appealed against this in HC, which ruled that a 1963 ruling of Lisbon court on rights of such allottees cannot serve as a precedent for Indian courts and govt, in exercise of its sovereign powers, can exercise its powers to resume land allotted by an erstwhile colonial govt.Dismissing appeals against the hcourt’s decision and writing a 79-page judgment, Justice Kant said, “The appellants’ pleas of waiver, acquiescence, delay, impossibility, and condonation have no legal or factual basis, and none of these principles render the Collector’s order, dated April 30, 1974, unsustainable.”“The Collector’s order was not tainted by mala fides and cannot be construed as having been passed with the intent to disentitle the appellants from the statutory benefits under the 1971 Land Reforms Regulation,” the bench said.","Dadra and nagar haveli liberated from portuguese occupation in 1954.

We feel Mumbai has missed being led by a definite and clear vision, which we feel we are in a position to offer,” Satam said.On a possible alliance between Raj and Uddhav Thackeray, Satam said they might have come together, but “this has not had any impact on the ground.

NEW DELHI: In a strong message to state regulatory bodies to act responsibly while dealing with complaints against advocates, SC Wednesday imposed a cost of Rs 50,000 each in two cases on Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa (BCMG) for entertaining frivolous complaints against two lawyers and ordering inquiries.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said that as per the law the bar councils concerned must record reasons for its prima facie belief that an advocate has committed misconduct requiring reference of the complaint to the disciplinary committee.It found that in both cases, references of complaints to DC were preceded by 'cryptic & laconic' orders without recording any satisfaction to the effect that the advocates committed misconduct.Interfaith marriage on the basis of fake conversion certificates is illegal, ruled Allahabad HC, adding such marriages could only be registered under Special Marriage Act, reports Rajesh Kumar Pandey. In the case, the petitioner, and a Hindu woman, sought orders directing respondents not to interfere in their marital life.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday ticked off the Union govt for opposing consideration of the plea of condemned prisoner Balwant Singh Rajoana, convicted of killing then Punjab CM Beant Singh in 1995, for commutation of death sentence.Rajoana has petitioned for reprieve on the ground that he has been on death row for nearly two decades now.Additional solicitor general K M Nataraj told a bench headed by Justice Vikram Nath that the President did not take a call on Rajoana's plea as it was filed by others and not by the prisoner himself. The bench, however, was not persuaded.Appearing for Rajoana, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said that Supreme Court has commuted death sentences of convicts who had been facing the gallows for just two years. ""Here the man has been behind bars for three decades, and two decades under the shadow of a death sentence. If SC commutes his sentence to life imprisonment, he will be released from prison,"" Rohatgi said.He cited an apex court judgment commuting the death sentence of Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar and said the man was convicted for 1993 bomb blasts in Delhi, which had killed nine persons, and had remained on death row since 2001.In 2014, SC commuted his sentence to life term on the ground that there had been an inordinate delay in his execution despite the President rejecting his mercy plea, argued the senior advocate.On Sept 27, 2019, Union home ministry informed the Punjab chief secretary that on the occasion of commemoration of 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev a decision was taken to commute Rajoana's death penalty to life term. But this was not given effect to.Rajoana, who had not appealed against the death sentence given by trial court in 2007 and its approval by Punjab and Haryana HC in 2010, moved SC seeking commutation of his death sentence on the ground that he was in prison for last 25 years and on death row for last 13 years.Rajoana and Jagtar Singh Hawara were awarded death sentences by the trial court for the bomb blast on Aug 31, 1995 which killed Beant Singh and 16 others outside the Punjab and Haryana Civil Secretariat in Chandigarh.",Balwant singh rajoana was convicted of killing then punjab cm beant singh in 1995.

Navi Mumbai Airport: Historic first landing at Navi Mumbai airport; private jet from Ahmedabad makes aviation milestone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/pvt-jet-becomes-first-aircraft-to-land-at-navi-mumbai-airport/articleshow/124052713.cms,"A private jet from Ahmedabad made history by being the first official aircraft to land at the Navi Mumbai airport, marking a significant milestone





MUMBAI: A private jet carrying passengers from Ahmedabad quietly scripted aviation history this weekend, becoming the first aircraft to officially land at the long-awaited Navi Mumbai airport.The jet, operating under a Non-Scheduled Operator Permit (charter), touched down at 10:20am on Saturday and flew back to Ahmedabad past noon the next day, completing the first-ever runway operation at the greenfield airport.Though an IndiGo Airbus 320 aircraft landed on the Navi Mumbai main runway 26 in Dec 2024, it was a validation flight mandated to test the airport's navigation systems.Prior to this, a symbolic touchdown took place in October, when an IAF Airbus C-295, a tactical airlifter, touched down on the main runway without using the airport's ground-based navigation aids.""The Airports Authority of India (AAI) on September 19 granted approval for the landing of a non-scheduled aircraft, marked 'passengers flight' at Navi Mumbai,"" said a source.To accommodate this arrival and departure, AAI cancelled its earlier notice (NOTAM to pilots, airlines) about Navi Mumbai runway's closure till 11:59pm, Sept 20.A new NOTAM was issued on Friday, which announced that the Navi Mumbai airport runway was open from 8:30am to 11am on Saturday and another three hours on Sunday.The private jet, a Pilatus PC-24 (VT-APV), took off from Ahmedabad at 9am to head south, overfly the Gulf of Khambhat, and then the Arabian Sea, from where it turned east to cross into Mumbai over Bandra and Sion, flying south of the busy city airport.It came south of the new Navi Mumbai airport, from where it turned north and then west to carry out an approach on runway 28 and land at 10:20 am. It departed Navi Mumbai airport at 12:40am on Sunday and took the land route to Ahmedabad.Over the weekend, the flight also landed on X, with @hiravaero posting a clip of the landing captured by Sandeep Pilania, a plane spotter. Industry experts pointed out that the new Navi Mumbai airport has other firsts still to come. The most awaited among these will be the first scheduled commercial airline flight.While PM Modi is set to inaugurate the airport and its terminal building on September 30, the commissioning of the airport, after the security sweeping and other procedures, is likely to take a few more months.But the landing or take-off of the first airline flight carrying fare-paying passengers will be the most significant milestone, as it would signal the start of a major capacity boost for Mumbai's overstretched airport infrastructure.","A private jet from ahmedabad made history by being the first official aircraft to land at the navi mumbai airport.

Poll Do you believe Sonam Wangchuk's actions are responsible for the violence in Ladakh? Yes No

NEW DELHI: The Union government on Wednesday said activist Sonam Wangchuk was responsible for the ongoing violence in Ladakh.“It is clear that mob violence in Ladakh was guided by activist Sonam Wangchuk through his provocative statements,” the government said in a statement.The Centre said Wangchuk's hunger strike continued despite ongoing talks through a High-Powered Committee that had delivered key concessions.""A hunger strike was started by Sonam Wangchuk on 10-09-2025 stating the demand of 6 schedule and statehood for Ladakh. It is well known that Government of India has been actively engaged with Apex Body Leh and the Kargil Democratic Alliance on same issues,"" it said.It further alleged that his provocative speeches incited a mob on 24 September, injuring over 30 security personnel and forcing police to fire, which caused casualties. The government said it remained committed to Ladakh’s aspirations.The statement came after Wangchuk defended Congress against Amit Malviya’s charge that the party was behind the violence in Ladakh. Wangchuk said, “Congress doesn’t have that kind of influence here to get 5,000 youth out on the roads. Yesterday, a Congress councillor went to a hospital in anger because two people from his village were brought there injured.”In a post on X, BJP IT Cell head Amit Malviya asked whether Congress leader Rahul Gandhi wanted this kind of unrest in Ladakh. ""This man rioting in Ladakh is Phuntsog Stanzin Tsepag, Congress Councillor for Upper Leh Ward. He can be clearly seen instigating the mob and participating in violence that targeted the BJP office and the Hill Council. Is this the kind of unrest Rahul Gandhi has been fantasising about?""

What is the protest about?

NEW DELHI: At least 4 people were killed and several were injured on Wednesday after a demonstration demanding statehood of Ladakh turned violent in the capital Leh.Climate activist Sonam Wangchuk - who is seen as the face of the protest - ended his 15-day hunger strike, expressing sadness over the violent escalation.Wangchuk termed this demonstration as ""youth's anger"" and ""Gen Z"" revolution.""I am sad to inform you that there was vandalism in Leh during a protest. Many offices and police vehicles were vandalised and burned. A bandh was announced in Leh, but the youth came in large numbers. This was youth's anger, a Gen-Z revolution,"" Wangchuk said in a video message as teargas shells were heard in the backdrop.Bharatiya Janata Party, meanwhile, said there was a conscious effort to liken this violence to that of Nepal's recent Gen Z protests, and alleged that in reality the agitation was not led by the youth but fuelled by the Congress.""Today, in Ladakh, attempts were made to portray some protests as being led by Gen Z. However, when investigated, it was discovered that these protests were not led by Gen Z, but by Congress. Congress councillor Stanzin Tsepang is the councillor from the Upper Leh ward. He is the main instigator, and numerous photos have surfaced of him and his workers instigating the violence. He can also be seen marching towards the BJP office with a weapon in his hand. He is instigating the mob and targeting the BJP office. A video of this has also surfaced, and the BJP has also posted it. Councillor Stanzin Tsepang is with Rahul Gandhi ,"" BJP MP Sambit Patra said.Additionally, government sources told news agency ANI that the situation in Leh didn't spiral on its own and it was ""engineered deliberately.""""Ladakh and its youth are paying a huge price for the narrow politics played by certain individuals and personal ambitions by Sonam Wangchuk,"" sources said.""The Centre had already fixed October 6 for the meeting of the High Powered Committee to discuss all issues posed by ABL and KDA. The Center also agreed on the new members for HPC as proposed by ABL. Upon receiving a request for preponement, some meetings were being considered on Sept 25-26. In fact, the Center has been always ready for the talks and on earlier occasions also talks were also proposed on 25th July which did not receive positive response,"" it added.Ladakh's Lt governor Kavinder Gupta also held vested interests responsible for violence.""In a democratic system, protesting is a right. However, it must be done in a peaceful manner. For the past two days, attempts have been made to incite people, and the protest held here was compared to those held in Bangladesh and Nepal. This smells of a conspiracy behind the protest,"" he said.Also read| Ladakh LG makes 'Bangladesh-Nepal' claim; vows thorough probe ""When police were deployed to control the law and order situation, a CRPF vehicle was torched. During the protest, DG's vehicle was attacked with stones. If this protest had not been stopped, then these people (protestors) would have ruined the entire city of Leh,"" he added.Wangchuk, later, backtracked from giving the ""Gen Z"" adjective to the protest and preferred to label the protest in Ladakh as a ""youth"" demonstration.In a virtual press conference, Sonam Wangchuk said, ""These people call themselves Gen Z, that's why we said that otherwise I refer to them as youths. Gen Z is not my term; people often use it to describe them. Actually, these are the youths,"" Wangchuk said.The Ladakh Apex Body (LAB) youth wing called for the protest after two of the 15 people, who were on a 35-day hunger strike since September 10, were shifted to a hospital because their condition deteriorated on Tuesday evening. The fast was to push the Centre to resume dialogue in support of their four-point demand - statehood, extension of Sixth Schedule, separate Lok Sabha seats for Leh and Kargil and reservation for employment.On Wednesday morning, Leh was completely shut down. Hundreds of people took to the streets. The situation worsened when some youth pelted stones at the headquarters of the BJP and the Hill Council. Police and paramilitary forces, deployed in strength across the town, lobbed teargas shells to bring the situation under control, the officials said.Later, the BJP office was vandalised and set on fire along with several vehicles. As the day progressed, flames and dark smoke clouds could be seen from afar.Police resorted to firing and teargas shelling to bring the situation under control after the protesters indulged in widespread violence, officials said.The administration imposed prohibitory orders under Section 163 of the BNSS to ban the assembly of five or more people, they said. Besides, Congress leader and councillor Phuntsog Stanzin Tsepag was booked for allegedly making a provocative speech at the hunger strike venue.The protest in the Union Territory gathered pace, demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh, which was carved out from Jammu and Kashmir in 2019.According to Wangchuk, the situation was the outcome of frustration among the youth because they have been kept away from jobs. He added that there is no democracy in Ladakh and the Sixth Schedule promise made to the public has not been fulfilled either.The Constitution's Sixth Schedule, meant for the tribal population of the four northeast states of Tripura, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Assam, makes special provisions in terms of governance, powers of president and the governor, type of local bodies, alternate judicial mechanisms and financial powers exercised through autonomous councils.Meanwhile, a fresh round of talks is scheduled between the ministry of home affairs and Ladakh representatives, comprising members of the LAB and the Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), on October 6.The two bodies have been jointly spearheading an agitation over the past four years in support of their demands and have held several rounds of talks with the government in the past.","At least 4 people were killed and several were injured on wednesday after a demonstration demanding statehood of ladakh turned violent.

'Will Shape India's Future as a Developed Nation': Modi Inaugurates Kartavya Bhavan | Central Vista

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday asked the country’s top bureaucrats and state chief secretaries to find ways to resolve issues plaguing infrastructure projects rather than waiting for him to hold reviews.He made these remarks while chairing the web-based Pragati meeting with the officials, where cabinet secretary T V Somananthan made a detailed presentation on the steps taken by Centre and states to expedite a couple of projects by decades, including the 83-km Nangal Dam-Talwara-Mukerian new railway line project in Punjab, North Koel Reservoir project in Bihar and Jharkhand, and the 5th Stream Refinery Expansion at Nalco’s plant in Odisha, sources said.“The PM urged officials to work out strategies for better coordination to resolve issues so that there is no delay in project execution. There has been a trend that all officials and agencies concerned expedite all approvals and clearances when any project is included for review at Pragati meeting. So, he meant that this should be a natural process,” said an official.In a statement, the PMO said Modi urged officials at both the central and state levels to adopt a result-oriented approach, translating opportunities into improved quality of life for people, while also advancing the goals of ease of living for citizens and ease of doing business for enterprises.During the meeting, the PM reviewed eight critical infrastructure projects across sectors, including mines, railways, water resources, industrial corridors, and power. These projects span 15 states and UTs, with a cumulative investment of over Rs 65,000 crore.","Pm narendra modi asked the country’s top bureaucrats and state chief secretaries to find ways to resolve issues plaguing infrastructure projects.

NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has registered a case against Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) general counsel and designated US-based terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun for having instigated Sikh soldiers to prevent Prime Minister Narendra Modi from hoisting the Indian tricolour at Red Fort here on August 15, and offering them a Rs 11 crore reward to do so.The FIR registered by NIA cites “credible” information and video retrieved from SFJ US official ‘X’ handle, on Aug 10, 2025, in which Pannun gave the call for stopping the PM Modi from hoisting the national flag. He also unveiled a map of Khalistan, envisioning Punjab, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh as its parts. Recalling his declaration that Shaheed Jatha of SFJ would fight against India, NIA said he had “indulged in activities for disrupting sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of India and spread disaffection among Sikhs against India. It added that the Centre was of the opinion that a scheduled offence under the NIA Act had been committed and must be investigated.As per the FIR, information with the Central govt indicated that Pannun had hosted a ‘meet the press’ at Lahore Press Club in Pakistan, on Aug 10, where he addressed journalists via video link from Washington, rejecting India’s sovereignty over Punjab and promoting the cause of Khalistan.“During the press meet, he also unveiled SFJ’s new ‘Delhi Banayga Khalistan’ referendum map which incorporates Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi into envisioned Khalistan,” the FIR states.Pannun has been charged with offences under Section 61(2) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (criminal conspiracy) and Sections 10 and 13 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, 1967.","The national investigation agency (nia) has registered a case against sikhs for justice (sfj) general counsel and designated us-based terrorist gurpatwant singh pannun.

NEW DELHI: The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) has written a letter to the Ministry of Civil Aviation demanding a judicial probe into the June 12 crash of Air India Flight AI 171, alleging that the officials are prematurely pushing a ""pilot error"" narrative.In its letter to the civil aviation minister, dated September 22, the FIP said the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) had ""fundamentally and irrevocably compromised the integrity, impartiality, and legality of the ongoing investigation.""The FIP alleged that the AAIB's conduct has ""moved beyond mere procedural irregularity into the realm of manifest bias and unlawful action. This has rendered the current investigation untenable, and its potential findings are likely to affect the morale of the pilots.""The federation alleged that AAIB officials visited the residence of Capt. Sabharwal’s 91-year-old father on August 30 “under the pretext of offering condolences” but instead made “damaging insinuations”.""During this interaction, these officials made damaging 'insinuations' based on a 'selective CVR interpretation and a so-called 'layered voice analysis,' suggesting that Capt. Sabharwal had deliberately moved the fuel control switches to the CUTOFF position post-take-off,"" the pilot body added.Calling the move “professionally indefensible,” the FIP accused AAIB of breaching rules by leaking protected CVR details to the media. Under Rule 17(5) of the Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Rules, 2017, disclosure of cockpit voice recordings is strictly prohibited.The leaks, FIP said, had led to the “character assassination of a decorated professional” with a three-decade career and over 15,000 flying hours.The pilots’ body further stressed that accident probes are meant to prevent future tragedies, not apportion blame, as per Rule 3 of the 2017 Rules.The letter said the probe ""contravenes the spirit and letter of ICAO Annex 13, which obligates member states to conduct independent and impartial investigations.”FIP argued that the flawed handling of the AI 171 probe risks damaging India’s credibility in the global aviation community.Urging immediate intervention, the federation added, ""The FIP submits that the circumstances surrounding the AI 171 investigation make the constitution of a Court of Inquiry not merely 'expedient,' but an absolute and urgent necessity.""Drawing parallels with the 2010 Mangalore crash of Air India Express Flight 812—where a Court of Inquiry was set up—the federation said the present case, with even greater loss of life, warranted no less.It has urged the government to constitute a Court of Inquiry led by a retired Supreme Court judge, supported by independent experts in flight operations, aircraft maintenance, avionics, and human factors.""The Federation of Indian Pilots, and the entire professional pilot community it represents, has a solemn and non-negotiable duty to the victims of Flight AI 171, to their grieving families, and to the future safety of the travelling public,"" the letter concluded.","The federation of indian pilots (fip) has written a letter to the ministry of civil aviation demanding a judicial probe into the june 12 crash of air india flight ai 171.

""State govt will not provide any financial grant, advertisement, or sponsorship to any event with which he is associated, either directly or indirectly. State govt will also request Union govt not to extend any financial assistance or sponsorship to him in any manner,"" the CM said.In Guwahati, fans gathered outside Narain's office as he addressed a press conference denying all allegations.Narain, who had travelled to Singapore, said he went to see Garg after being informed by Mahanta that the singer had met with an accident.At Gauhati high court, advocate Sandeep Chamaria filed a PIL seeking transfer of the case to CBI with court monitoring, arguing possible lapses in security for the singer in Singapore. The plea will be heard Nov 10.The singer's wife Garima Saikia Garg vowed to complete his unfinished Assamese musical film 'Roi Roi Binale', which he produced and had scheduled for an Oct 31 release.

This, despite being a body meant to regulate the medical profession in public interest.Hundreds of complaints and appeals filed by patients or their families have been rejected since NMC came into existence on Sept 25, 2020. The draft amendment of the NMC Act, put in public domain by the health ministry in Dec 2022, contains a provision that provides for the public to file appeals before NMC's Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB) against decisions or actions of state medical councils in complaints related to medical negligence or professional misconduct. A file noting acquired using RTI shows the draft amendment was approved in 2023. However, the file hasn't moved since then.The health ministry told Parliament in Aug - in response to an MP's query asking if there was ""bias in favour of doctors"" in NMC - that the mechanism to handle complaints was provided in clause 8.8 of Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002. What it did not reveal was that the EMRB division continues to reject patients' appeals, reiterating that an appeal from a non-RMP (someone not a registered medical practitioner) cannot be accepted since Section 30(3) of NMC Act states that medical professionals aggrieved by state council decisions can appeal.""Even though nothing in Section 30(3) expressly bars patients from filing appeals, NMC, in a meeting in Oct 2021, decided only appeals of doctors will be allowed.

NEW DELHI: CBSE will conduct class X and XII board exams from February 17 next year, officials announced Wednesday, unveiling a tentative date sheet for the country's largest school-level examination exercise. In a significant first, the class X exam will be held twice in the same academic year.CBSE examination controller Sanyam Bhardwaj said the class X exam will be conducted first between Feb 17 and March 6, and for the second time from May 15 to June 1. The second phase will be optional, meant for students who wish to improve their performance. If a student appears in both sessions, the better of the two scores will be retained.""The second session will effectively double up as a supplementary exam. Hence, no separate supplementary exams will be conducted under this new system,"" Bhardwaj said. He added that the scheme of studies, syllabus and the examination pattern will remain unchanged across both sessions.Currently, students are allowed to appear in supplementary exams to improve their results, but the two-session model marks a major shift in CBSE's assessment approach.For class XII, the board has fixed the exam schedule from Feb 17 to April 9. Bhardwaj also detailed the evaluation timeline, noting that answer-script checking will begin roughly 10 days after the conduct of each paper and conclude within 12 days. ""For example, if the class XII Physics paper is held onFeb 20, evaluation will likely start on March 3 and finish by March 15,"" he explained.The scale of the exercise will be vast. Around 45 lakh candidates are expected to appear for the examinations across classes X and XII in 204 subjects, with candidates spread not only across India but also in 26 other countries.Officials said the two-session model for class X was introduced after extensive deliberations, with the aim of reducing student stress and giving them another chance to improve their performance within the same academic year. Educationists believe the move will align CBSE closer with global assessment systems that focus on flexibility and student choice.","Cbse will conduct class x and xii board exams from february 17 next year.

Supreme Court Says Flaws In Bihar SIR Can Nullify Exercise; Ruling To Extend Across The country

NEW DELHI: Election Commission now requires an applicant seeking fresh enrolment or inclusion/exclusion of a voter from the electoral roll via online mode to mandatorily verify his identity through OTP-based Aadhaar authentication.While online applications related to the electoral roll - through Form 6 (fresh enrolment), Form 7 (objection to inclusion/exclusion of voter in roll) and Form 8 (corrections) - would henceforth require'e-sign' based on Aadhaar authentication, those who do not have Aadhaar number can always fill out the physical forms and personally submit them to the electoral registration officer (ERO) or the booth level officer (BLO).The 'e-sign' requirement for online applications related to the voters' list, EC sources told TOI, was conceptualised in Aug and rolled out quietly in the second week of Sept. The reform, it was underlined, preceded Congress MP Rahul Gandhi's Sept 18 press conference during which he had alleged unauthorised attempts at deletion of over 6,000 voters in Aland assembly constituency of Karnataka in Dec 2022.The 'e-sign' initiative is meant to ensure that the applicant's name in the electoral photo identity card (EPIC) and phone number - as declared in the online Forms 6, 7 or 8 - matches with his/her details recorded in the Aadhaar system.Form 7 allows an elector to object against the proposed inclusion or exclusion of a voter in the electoral roll of a constituency in which he himself is also registered. Such an applicant must mention his name, EPIC number and mobile number of self 'or' relative (father/mother/husband/legal guardian) in the form. The e-sign option prompts the applicant to complete his OTP-based Aadhaar authentication before submitting the form.EC had, soon after Rahul's presser, clarified only 24 of the 6,018 applications for deletions in Aland were found genuine, while the remaining 5,994 were found incorrect, and rejected. An FIR was filed on Sept 6, 2023 by the Aland ERO in the case and all available details handed over to the investigation agency.","Ec now requires an applicant seeking fresh enrolment or inclusion/exclusion of a voter from the electoral roll via online mode to mandatorily verify his identity.
