The art of giving without glory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-art-of-giving-without-glory/articleshow/123585835.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. At a recent award ceremony featuring stars, YouTubers, and comedians, I saw a young woman seemingly out of place — quiet and shy — When her name was announced, the hall fell silent — Selva Brinda of Trichy, a young mother who donated more than 300 litres of breast milk over 22 months to premature and malnourished infants in government hospitals. Her act of silent generosity reminded me of a verse from the Thirukkural : Eaththuvakkum Inbam AriyaarKol Thaamudaimai Vaiththizhakkum Vanka Navar “Do the hard-hearted, who hoard their wealth only to lose it someday, Not know the joy of giving?” ( Kural 228) Thiruvalluvar does not preach here—he questions, almost with disbelief, why anyone would cling to what would eventually slip away. I was fortunate to learn the art of giving from my grandmother. She never went to school but taught us something no school could teach. When beggars came to our door, she would hand us small coins, and we would run joyfully to give them. When the poor asked for rice instead, she would give it herself. I once asked her why and said, “My palms are bigger than yours—they can hold more.” From this wonderful woman, I learned three lessons that shaped my understanding of giving. The first is that giving should be silent. My grandmother gave because she wanted to, not because anyone was watching. Today, I sometimes see social media reels of influencers distributing food or clothes to the poor—always with cameras turned on. The act of kindness is shared, but so is the humiliation of the receiver. The second lesson is that if you choose to give, give the best. I still remember the days after the tsunami, when we received ten large sacks of relief material filled with torn clothes, broken slippers, cracked vessels—discards rather than gifts of the heart. Giving is not about clearing cupboards. If your hands extend to another, let them carry the best you own—the blanket you would choose for your own child, the food you yourself would eat. The third lesson is that giving must be immediate. The more we wait, the more our minds bargain—why give so much, why give at all? The Mahabharata has a story of Karna that captures this. One day, while eating, he was approached by a poor man seeking alms. Without pausing, he scooped a handful from a heap of gold coins beside him, with his left hand, and gave it. The old man, surprised, gently reminded him that alms should not be offered with the left hand. Karna apologised and explained, “I was eating, yes, but I feared that if I delayed it even for a moment, I might give less than I intended.” Such was his urgency to give, as if the opportunity itself was sacred. When I see acts like Selva Brinda’s, I’m reminded of these three lessons again: a young mother who gave quietly, gave the best she had, and gave without delay. Science today tells us that generosity releases oxytocin, the ‘love hormone’, and floods the giver with joy. But long before science measured it, human hearts knew it. The bliss of giving is not just an emotion—it is the only wealth that grows by sharing. Why hoard what must one day be left behind? To give is to live twice—once for oneself, and once for the other.","Thirukkural with the times explores real-world lessons from the classic tamil text.

'Let's together fight larger battle': Why Kapil Sibal's advice may not stop Arvind Kejriwal from targeting Congress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lets-together-fight-larger-battle-why-kapil-sibals-advice-may-not-stop-arvind-kejriwal-from-targeting-congress/articleshow/123588172.cms,"Arvind Kejriwal, Kapil Sibal (C), Rahul Gandhi (R)

NEW DELHI: ""Stop the bickering. Let's together fight the larger battle!"" - Kapil Sibal 's advice to Arvind Kejriwal after the AAP convener's latest offensive against the Congress is unlikely to impress the former Delhi chief minister.Sibal, who served as Union minister in the UPA governments and is currently an Independent Rajya Sabha member, counselled Kejriwal after the AAP convener alleged a nexus between the BJP and the Congress and questioned why no ""big leader"" of the grand old party had been arrested in the National Herald case ""We keep on getting offers for a compromise. Now, even people are seeing that Congress has reached a compromise with the BJP. The National Herald case is an open and shut case. But no big leader of the Congress has gone to jail. Five of our big leaders were sent to jail in a fake case,"" Kejriwal said at a meeting of AAP MLAs and councillors in the national capital.Citing examples from Goa, the AAP supremo emphasised, ""People ask why the BJP has sent five of AAP's top leaders to jail but not a single Congress leader. They shout endlessly about the National Herald case, which I myself read about online.As per facts, it looks like an open-and-shut case. Yet despite serious allegations, no one from the Gandhi family has gone to jail, while we are jailed in completely fabricated cases. ""Kejriwal also made a mention of the land scam cases of Haryana and named Robert Vadra to highlight his point. ""In 2014 the BJP built its campaign around 'jija ji' (brother-in-law) and corruption, shouting about Vadra, 2G and coal scams. Yet today, all those cases have quietly been shut. The people are not fools. They can see the reality--that Congress and BJP are in a hidden alliance,"" he said.Kejriwal and several other AAP leaders were booked and arrested in the alleged liquor scam case and other cases. All the AAP leaders were eventually granted bail. However, Kejriwal resigned ahead of the assembly elections and made Atishi the chief minister of Delhi.Sibal, who has been associated with the grand old party for a long time, was quick to remind Kejriwal about the consequences of his baseless allegations against political rivals in the past.""Kejriwal ji: When you made allegations against several politicians and others and was dragged to court you apologised! Today you made baseless allegations against the Gandhi family (National Herald case). Stop the bickering. Let's together fight the larger battle!"" Sibal said in a post on X.But the question is: Will Kejriwal heed Sibal's advice? Well, it seems unlikely as the ties between the two parties nosedived during the last Delhi elections when Congress played a key role in the defeat of AAP at the hands of the BJP.While both Congress and AAP are part of the opposition's INDIA bloc, the two parties have all along shared uneasy ties - characterised by threats, warnings and blackmails. When INDIA bloc was formed, Kejriwal made AAP's participation conditional to Congress's support against the Centre's Delhi ordinance. The two parties did join hands in Delhi for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections after a lot of back and forth, but the experiment failed to stop the BJP from winning all the 7 Lok Sabha seats in the national capital for the third time in a row.In the assembly elections, the two allies turned into bitter rivals and went all out to discredit each other. With the Congress putting all its might against AAP, the BJP gained and managed to return to power in the national capital after a long gap of 27 years.In Haryana assembly elections, the two parties tried to stich an alliance but could not reach a common ground. In several other states like Gujarat, Goa, the AAP has successfully contested on its own and managed to spread its reach. Till they lost elections in Delhi, AAP was the only party besides BJP and Congress to have government in two states.The Congress, on the other hand, despite all its electoral reverses in the last 11 years, remains the only opposition party with pan-India presence and hence takes the position of principal challenger to the BJP.Any attempt to broker peace between AAP and Congress is unlikely to succeed as the two parties remain rivals in Punjab where assembly elections are due early in 2027. Both the parties have huge stakes in the state. In the last assembly elections in 2022, AAP had decimated the Congress and stormed to power winning 92 of the 117 assembly seats in the state.For AAP, Punjab remains the only state where it has government and hence led by Kejriwal the party will go out to retain the state. On the other hand, the Congress which has considerable presence in the state, will do everything possible to return to power.In the given scenario, it will be difficult for AAP and Congress to come together for the larger fight - the 2029 Lok Sabha elections, when the INDIA bloc will once again try to challenge the dominance of BJP-led NDA.","Sibal counselled kejriwal after the aap convener alleged a nexus between the bjp and the congress.

Mahua Moitra Under Fire: TMC MP’s ‘Cut Amit Shah’s Head’ Jibe Draws Sharp BJP Backlash

NEW DELHI: TMC MP Mahua Moitra has lit a political powder keg with her explosive remark targeting Union home minister Amit Shah , allegedly saying his ""head should be cut off"". The BJP condemned the statement as a ""distasteful and hate remark,"" with the party lodging a complaint at Krishnanagar's Kotwali police station.While speaking on the issue of illegal immigration along India’s eastern border, Moitra, addressing in Bengali, reportedly said: ""Amit Shah’s head should be cut off and placed on the table.""However, there is no independent confirmation of the statement.Meanwhile, the BJP hit back at TMC MP over her statement, calling it ""distasteful and hate remarks"" and asking whether it represented the TMC's official position.Moitra, speaking to reporters in Nadia district during an event, accused the Union government of neglecting its responsibility on border security. ""They are repeatedly talking about infiltrators; but the border of India is protected by five forces, and that is directly the Home Ministry's responsibility,"" she said.She also referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech. ""Standing at Red Fort, the PM himself said infiltrators are causing demographic changes.But even as he was saying this, his Home Minister was standing in the front row, smiling and clapping,"" she added.The BJP's West Bengal unit later amplified her comments on X, sharing Moitra's picture with the statement as its caption, while intensifying its attack on the TMC leader.Later in the day, TMC MP Moitra hit back at the BJP over the row surrounding her alleged remark on Union home minister Shah.In a post on X, she wrote: ""Modus operandi of BJP troll cell – pick one issue, give it to all resident twits (and an ‘a’ instead of an ‘i’ would be just as well) and make it ‘viral’ on social media. Today’s theme is Mahua Moitra’s Off With His Head metaphor. Long live my infamy, guys. Love it.""Defending Moitra, her TMC colleague Kunal Ghosh told PTI that the remark was symbolic. ""Mahua Moitra's comment has no physical implications, nor did she intend to attack Union home minister Amit Shah. She was trying to make a symbolic statement, which did not translate well,"" he said.Reflecting on TMC MP's comment, BJP's Pradeep Bhandari called it a language of ""urban naxals"", saying, ""This is the language of political urban naxals. Mahua Moitra, Rahul Gandhi and all Opposition leaders are trying to provoke violence in the minds of people through their words. This is their culture that they abuse the late mother of the Prime Minister...All of this makes it clear that their 'niti' and 'niyat' are not in the interest of the nation or the public. ""On TMC MP's remark, BJP spokesperson RP Singh said, ""Be it Mahua Moitra or Congress party - one party abuses PM's mother and the other party's leader says that Amit Shah should be beheaded. It shows their frustration. They know that they are going to lose Bihar and Bengal is next. So, such language is being used out of frustration.""","Tmc mp mahua moitra reportedly said: ""amit shah’s head should be cut off and placed on the table"" the bjp condemned the statement as a ""distasteful and hate remark,"" with the party lodging a complaint at krishnanagar's kotwali police station.

This is a property of the state government, right?

Do you want commission?

Social media reacts



A video from the Jharkhand high court surfaced online showing a judge sternly reprimanding an IAS officer during a hearing. In the clip, which is now going viral on social media, the judge can be seen calling out the officer over alleged discrepancies and irregularities.The IAS officer’s name and posting remain unverified, but the judge is heard warning that an FIR will be filed to initiate an investigation.The incident reportedly took place when the judge was hearing a case related to land acquisition and compensation, but the IAS officer had objected to the compensation being offered to the petitioner.“Who are you to object? Ye state ka property hai na? () the judge can be heard saying in the video.""If the state has recognised any person as a ryot, who are you to say that person is not a ryot. You are an alien to the dispute,"" the judge further added.The judge also accused the officer of taking commissions while questioning his authority to object, saying he was preventing rightful awards from being given.“Commission chahiye aapko? () You want commission in each and every case? Under what authority you have objected? The award has been prepared.You are depriving the person of getting the award” the judge said.“You have to take contempt or I will lodge an FIR against you” he said.“Don’t raise a dispute if you are an outsider. In a property dispute, will you come in like a monkey to claim a share?” the judge can be heard saying.The video has drawn appreciation for how the judge handled the situation.“Wow!! Simply awesome. So satisfying to watch this episode. The bureaucrat thought he was above law for a moment. Hats off to you, the judiciary, and judge,” a user commented.“If all Judges take the right approach and ask all IAS officers, EC, and ED to apply law as per the Constitution, 50 percent cases will go away from court,” commented another.“Judicial accountability in action! The judge's sharp questioning demonstrates that courts are taking corruption seriously. This direct approach could deter future misconduct if consistently applied across all levels of bureaucracy,” read another comment.","A video from the jharkhand high court surfaced online showing a judge sternly reprimanding an ias officer during a hearing.

Dharmasthala Mass Burial Case: Whistleblower Arrested by SIT After Inconsistencies Found

NEW DELHI: Sujata Bhat, who had previously alleged that her daughter Ananya disappeared from the Dharmasthala temple premises in 2003, had reportedly expressed her desire to withdraw the complaint during the Special Investigation Team's (SIT) interrogation.During the interrogation on Friday, the SIT found Sujata's statement to be contradictory to her earlier claims, suggesting she was lying and obstructing the legal process. Investigators noted that she appeared to be under significant pressure and was struggling with the sustained interrogation, PTI reported.While Sujata had earlier claimed that the disappearance of her daughter was part of a larger conspiracy, she disclosed the names of certain individuals allegedly involved in it on Friday.However, the SIT officials did not confirm the details, stating that the disclosures are being verified.The case has drawn widespread attention following allegations that the narrative of a missing girl may have been fabricated. The SIT's ongoing efforts focus on verifying Sujata’s claims and finding evidence to substantiate the complaint.Legal experts said even if Sujata formally withdraws her complaint, the SIT would likely continue the investigation, as the matter involves serious allegations and has already entered the judicial process.The case, which has triggered political sparring and public debates, remains under close watch, with the SIT expected to submit an interim report in the coming weeks, said a senior police official.","Sujata bhat, who had previously alleged that her daughter ananya disappeared from the dharmasthala temple premises in 2003, had reportedly expressed her desire to withdraw the complaint.

Japan PM Ishiba Roots For Make-in-India, Outlines Three Initiatives To Strengthen Delhi-Tokyo Ties

NEW DELHI: As Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Tokyo on Friday for the India-Japan Economic Forum, Modi Archive, which narrates his life through archival records, recalled his first visit to the country in 2007, when he was Gujarat chief minister In April 2007, PM Modi had embarked on a six-day visit to Japan, leading a 40-member delegation of bureaucrats and industry leaders. His mission: to showcase Gujarat as India’s gateway for investment in industry, infrastructure, and innovation.Traveling through Tokyo, Osaka, Hiroshima and Kobe, PM Modi courted corporate heavyweights including Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, Suzuki, Toshiba, Nippon Steel, and Tsuneshi Shipbuilding. The trip resulted in MoUs between JETRO (Japan External Trade Organization) and Gujarat’s Industries Department.""Ports, logistics, infrastructure and human resource development were on the table at the Japan Chambers of Commerce and Industries and Indo-Japan Friendship Forum, with Gujarat pitching itself as the natural entry point for Japan into India’s growth story,"" wrote Modi Archives on X.A key highlight was PM Modi’s meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, where the two leaders discussed the Delhi–Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC).PM Modi presented Abe with a CD on Gujarat’s Buddhist heritage and a handwoven tribal shawl, inviting him to visit the state. In return, Abe assured Japan’s full support for Gujarat’s segment of the DMIC, cementing a foundation for deeper Indo-Japan economic and cultural ties.""Perhaps the most iconic moment of the visit came when he stepped into the cockpit of a Japanese Bullet Train . What if such high-speed rail transformed Indian connectivity? That seed of an idea in 2007 would blossom years later into the Mumbai–Ahmedabad Bullet Train project, the flagship of Indo-Japanese cooperation.In April 2007, PM Modi walked through Hiroshima’s Peace Memorial Park, pausing at the Prayer of the Fountain and the Suzuki Miekichi Literary Monument. Later in Kobe, he joined a cultural programme at The India Club, a historic hub for the Indian diaspora since 1904. That visit planted the seeds of deeper business and cultural ties between Gujarat and Japan.By July 2012, PM Modi returned on a much larger stage. Invited formally by the Government of Japan for a five-day tour (22–27 July), he was accorded a Cabinet-rank reception — an honour rarely extended to a state leader. It was the 60th anniversary of India–Japan diplomatic ties, and PM Modi’s packed itinerary covered 44 engagements across Tokyo, Hamamatsu, Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe.PM Modi had met key Japanese ministers — Koichiro Gemba (Foreign Affairs), Yukio Edano (Trade & Industry), Yuchiro Hata (Infrastructure & Transport), and Deputy PM Katsuya Okada — along with governors Hideaki Omura of Aichi and Toshizo Ido of Hyogo. At JETRO’s investment seminars, he pitched Gujarat as an investor-friendly, power-surplus state, emphasizing ports, logistics, and industrial corridors.Business diplomacy was central: PM Modi had held extensive meetings with corporate leaders, including a landmark session with Osamu Suzuki, Chairman of Suzuki Motors. Touring facilities and sharing lunch with him, Modi pitched Gujarat as Asia’s next automotive hub. Round-tables at Mizuho Corporate Bank and the Imperial Hotel deepened corporate ties further.Infrastructure was another highlight. Riding the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Hamamatsu, PM Modi explored possibilities for high-speed rail and metro projects in Gujarat, focusing on Japan’s model of speed, efficiency, and safety. At Kobe Port, he studied maritime systems that could guide Gujarat’s own port expansion, reaffirming the state’s centrality in the Delhi–Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC).Cultural outreach balanced the diplomacy. PM Modi had addressed the Gujarat Samaj of Japan, met members of the India Centre Foundation, and was honoured at a reception hosted by HCCI Chairman Mimuro. At Kobe’s India Club, he engaged with the diaspora and even took a symbolic boat ride at the port.","Prime minister narendra modi arrived in tokyo on friday for the india-japan economic forum.

Amit Shah Condemns Congress Culture Of Hatred, Demands Apology For Remarks On PM Modi’s Mother

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will fulfil its promise of making the country free of infiltrators.Speaking at a programme in Guwahati on the birth centenary of Assam’s first non-Congress chief minister, Golap Borbora, Shah said the high-power demography mission announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Independence Day would help study demographic patterns and identify infiltrators.""We had made a promise to Assam, but we have not been able to fulfil it in 10 years. But we will keep our promise and make Assam and the entire country free of illegal foreigners,"" he said.""I am among those people who believe that not a single infiltrator should stay in our country,"" he added.Shah recalled that Borbora, who led a Janata Party government in Assam from March 1978 to September 1979, had ordered a drive to clean up the voters' list during the Mangaldai Lok Sabha by-election.""Even in the absence of computerised electoral rolls, Borbora's government detected names of 36,780 illegal foreigners, and this cleansing of the voters' list can be deemed as the origin of the Assam Agitation,"" he said.He said the Election Commission is now cleaning the voters' list through the SIR process, but some parties are opposing it. ""It shows the moral degradation in today's politics,"" he said.Shah said Borbora would have opposed the parties that are against the SIR exercise.He also praised the Assam government for its measures against ""infiltrators"", including eviction of encroachments. He appreciated chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and his government for honouring Borbora, noting that Borbora was a socialist leader with no links to the BJP.Earlier in the day, Shah, in an apparent reference to state Congress president Gaurav Gogoi's alleged ""links"" with the foreign nation, said Assam cannot be led by people who make frequent visits to Pakistan.He asserted that the BJP-led NDA will form the third consecutive government in Assam next year.","Home minister amit shah said the bharatiya janata party (bjp) will fulfil its promise of making the country free of infiltrators.

New Delhi: Govt on Friday approved extension of ex-servicemen contributory health scheme (ECHS) to around 500 officer cadets who over the years have been boarded out of military academies on medical grounds after being injured during rigorous physical training.The one-time Rs 1.2 lakh subscription fee applicable to ex-servicemen officers for joining ECHS will not be charged from officer cadets, a defence ministry official said. Cadets who join National Defence Academy, Officers Training Academy and Indian Military Academy were till now not eligible for ECHS as they are not granted ex-servicemen (ESM) status on being boarded out before completing their training.""While a small number of cadets annually are affected, the financial and emotional burden on their families is significant. In such instances, the practice is to extend a monthly ex gratia payment to such cadets,"" the official said.""In addition, based on the extent of disability (20-100%), a monthly ex gratia disability award is also made available to such cadets. With this approval, these cadets will now be eligible for availing cashless and capless healthcare facilities under ECHS,"" he added.","The one-time rs 1.2 lakh subscription fee applicable to ex-servicemen officers for joining echs will not be charged from officer cadets, a defence ministry official said.

ED secures first Interpol 'Purple Notice',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-secures-first-interpol-purple-notice/articleshow/123592590.cms,".

NEW DELHI: In a first, the ED has secured an Interpol Purple Notice on trade-based money laundering modus operandi. The notice was published on August 21 and alerts all investigative agencies across Interpol's 196 member countries to keep watch on shell entities engaged in such activities.The enforcement agency has shared an organised network of domestic and foreign shell entities engaged in large-scale laundering of funds under the guise of international trade. ""The conspirators exploited trade mechanisms and banking channels by under-invoicing imports, using sham duty-free imports (such as semiconductors), forging compliance documents, and carrying out circular re-exports through third-country entities to disguise illicit remittances,"" the ED said.The Purple Notice is one of eight types published by Interpol, providing member countries with information on modus operandi, objects, devices and concealment methods used by criminals.""The circular trading created a false narrative of international commerce, masking large-scale laundering of funds. The scheme exhibited hawala-like features but operated through formal banking systems, shell companies, and forged trade documentation to evade regulatory detection,"" the ED said, and added that the publishing of the notice is an attempt at generating awareness and sensitising its global counterparts to these new emerging money laundering trends.The agency said timely and precise gathering of information through informal cooperation is vital to effective domestic investigation. India has been sensitising expert groups and organisations active at international level which may be instrumental in facilitating informal cooperation between jurisdictions.India through ED is utilising platforms like Globe Network and Asset Recovery Interagency Network-Asia Pacific to shape global policies for combating money laundering and preventing safe havens for the proceeds of crime. ""The publishing of this Purple Notice also serves as a testimony to the leadership role being assumed by India, through ED on various international platforms,"" a senior officer said.","The notice was published on august 21 and alerts all investigative agencies across interpol's 196 member countries.

NEW DELHI: New Delhi: Kohima, Visakhapatnam and Bhubaneswar are top scorers among seven cities that qualified as safest for women in the 'Index on Women Safety (NARI) 2025' - based on a survey conducted in 31 major cities covering all states. Ranchi and Srinagar have the lowest scores on the index.Among metropolitan cities, Mumbai figures among the top seven cities, while the set of seven cities with the lowest scores also includes capital Delhi and Kolkata.Besides Kohima, the northeastern cities of Aizawl, Gangtok and Itanagar figure among the top cities in the safety rankings, often correlating with higher gender equity, infrastructure, policing or civic participation.Faridabad, Patna and Jaipur are the other cites with the lowest score, correlating with poorer infrastructure, patriarchal norms or weaker institutional responsiveness, according to the survey, which captured perceptions and lived experiences of 12,770 women to generate the index.As far as the national average is concerned, the mean score is 65%, and cities in the index have been categorised as ""much above"", ""above"", ""below"", and ""much below"" this benchmark.The 'National Annual Report & Index on Women's Safety (NARI) 2025' conceived by data science company Pvalue Analytics was released by National Commission for Women chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar at a programme here.The NCW chief said a safe environment was crucial for building a developed and inclusive India and assured that the commission will build on the suggestions in the survey report to bridge the gaps to strengthen women safety.The report highlights that National Crime Records Bureau data presents only the tip of the iceberg -crimes actually registered. NARI shows that two out of three women do not report - meaning NCRB could miss two-thirds of events experienced by women.The report showed that while 60% of women surveyed felt ""safe"", a significant 40% felt ""not so safe"" or ""unsafe"" in their cities. Perceptions of safety drop sharply at night, highlighting ongoing concerns about public infrastructure (lighting, patrolling) and societal factors, it said.However, when it comes to reporting of unsafe incidents, reporting remains low with only 33% of victims reporting their experiences to authorities, while 67% choosing not to report.Prevalence of harassment remains high with 7% women reporting at least one incident of harassment in public spaces in 2024.However, when it comes to reporting of unsafe incidents, reporting remains low with only 33% of victims reporting their experiences to authorities, while 67% choosing not to report.","Kohima, visakhapatnam and bhubaneswar are top scorers among seven cities that qualified as safest for women.

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear on Monday RJD 's request for a week's extension of the Sept 1 deadline for people in Bihar to submit their claims and objections to the draft voter list prepared by the Election Commission after special intensive revision (SIR).Appearing for RJD, advocate Prashant Bhushan told a bench of Justices Surya Kant, Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi that a large number of applications seeking inclusion of names in the voter list is streaming in and pleaded that it would be prudent for the EC to extend the Sept 1 deadline by a week to enable every person left out of the voter list to take corrective measures.The bench asked Bhushan as to why RJD is not making such a request to EC. ""If the EC finds the request genuine and backed by facts, it will surely extend it,"" the bench said. But Bhushan persisted with the request for an urgent hearing to which the bench acceded and posted the applications for hearing on Monday.Appearing for some other applicants, senior advocates Shoeb Alam and Shadan Farasat told the bench that prior to the Aug 22 order of the SC impleading all 12 recognised political parties in Bihar in the proceedings, as many as 80,000 claims and objections were filed. Since Aug 22, nearly 95,000 more such applications have been filed, which is indicative of more people finding discrepancies in the draft voter list.","The supreme court on friday agreed to hear on monday rjd's request for a week's extension of the sept 1 deadline for people in bihar to submit their claims and objections.

New Delhi: The govt will soon rank states on parameters of quality of land records, ease of land acquisition and their active participation for taking up highway development works. Delay in getting land and poor land records are the biggest hindrances in execution of road projects.“We are planning to carry out ranking of states on quality of land records, ease of acquisition and the support that we get for completing land acquisition. Then we can fix timelines for projects based on the assessment of which parameters a state has fulfilled,” said road transport and highways secretary V Umashankar while speaking at a workshop on effective project preparation and robust monitoring by Build India Foundation.The secretary said there have been instances where issues of missing plots (plots not acquired) came to light after getting project approval and during tendering process. “You come to know about this after 7-8 months. So, a part (a stretch of the project) comes to a standstill. We go through another exercise, which has its own set of complications and then leads to a prolongation issue at a later stage...There is a disease of missing plots.There are specific states that have 100% such problems. So, the land plan becomes a very important element in the entire project,” he added.On project preparation, the secretary said it’s not easy. Giving an example, Umashankar said in the US, which is often referred for expressway development, 38% of all land is owned by federal and state govts.",Delay in getting land and poor land records are the biggest hindrances in execution of road projects.

NEW DELHI: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday said that the Sambhal report, which the judicial commission submitted, revealed how a conspiracy for riot unfolded in 2024.The three-member panel met the CM on Thursday and submitted its report concerning the violence that erupted near the Shahi Jama Masjid on November 24 during an ASI-monitored survey of the mosque. The unrest resulted in four fatalities and injuries to several others. In the document, a sharp demographic shift is observed.Highlighting major demographic shifts in Sambhal, the report notes that the Hindu population declined from 45 percent at the time of Independence to 15 percent currently, while Muslims now constitute 85 percent of the population.Speaking at the inauguration and foundation-laying ceremony for various development projects in Sambhal, the UP CM asserted that the state is transitioning from ""appeasement"" to ""satisfaction,"" leaving no room for any demographic shift. Adityanath linked the violence to a history of “targeted actions” against Hindus under previous state governments.“The judicial commission submitted its report on the Sambhal incident on Thursday, revealing parts of how a conspiracy for riot unfolded in 2024,"" Adityanath said.“During the tenure of the Samajwadi Party and Congress, Hindus were selectively targeted, their demography was reduced, they were continuously subjected to oppression, and areas were made Hindu-free through riots. But there is a double-engine govt in place today, which will not allow the demography to change. Whoever dares to change the demography will be forced to flee because every citizen is now getting the benefits of government schemes without any discrimination,” he added.According to the PTI's sources, the judicial panel report asserts that Hindus have been ""consistently made the primary target in every riot since 1947"" and were again the focus of a plot during the Sambhal flare-up.The report credits Uttar Pradesh Police with preventing a ""massacre"" and notes that the rioters were brought in from outside the region. The report also links internal clashes to enduring Turk-Pathan tensions and states that the controversy over the Harihar temple, allegedly replaced by the mosque, was exacerbated by references to Babur's legacy, intensifying the atmosphere, the sources told PTI.Report alleges that radical organisations and illegal arms and drug networks were activated to destabilise the region, while praising the swift action taken by the state.According to the PTI, the panel traces Sambhal's history of communal strife to a 1953 Shia-Sunni clash, with major riots occurring in 1956, 1959, 1962—when Jan Sangh MLA Mahesh Gupta was stabbed—1966, and 1976, when a mosque committee dispute and the murder of a maulvi triggered temple attacks and curfews.Meanwhile, minister of state for secondary education Gulab Devi flagged the issue and asked where did the 30 per cent of Hindu population go.Commenting on the report, Devi, said, “The investigation shows that the Hindu population in Sambhal dropped from 45 per cent at the time of Independence to 15 per cent now.“Where did this 30 per cent go? Did they migrate? Did they convert? Or were they killed? The high court or our government will take action based on the facts mentioned in the report.”","'congress partitioned bharat in name of appeasement': yogi adityanath remembers 1947 tragedy.
