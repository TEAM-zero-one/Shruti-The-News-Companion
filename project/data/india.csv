NEW DELHI: Terming Congress the ""proud flagbearer"" of the national song, Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge Friday said ' Vande Mataram ', which was first publicly sung by Rabindranath Tagore at Congress session in 1896, awakened the collective soul of the nation and became the rallying cry for the freedom struggle.He alleged RSS never accepted the song and has stuck to its ""Namaste Sada Vatsale"" despite the national song's universal reverence. Kharge said the song echoed across the land from the Partition of Bengal in 1905 to the last breaths of the country's brave revolutionaries, and terrified the British into banning it.He recalled that Mahatma Gandhi in 1915 wrote that 'Vande Mataram' had become the ""most powerful battle cry among Hindus and Musalmans of Bengal during the Partition days"", while Jawaharlal Nehru said in 1938 that ""for more than 30 years now, the song is related directly to Indian nationalism.""Kharge claimed the UP assembly started reciting 'Vande Mataram' in 1937.

KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee fell victim to cyber fraud , with around Rs 56 lakh siphoned off from his bank account using another 'dormant' account linked to him.The bank has filed a complaint with Kolkata Police's cybercrime unit, reports Dwaipayan Ghosh. Between 2001 and 2006, when Banerjee was the MLA from Asansol South, an account was opened in his name, along with other legislators, at a public sector bank's legislative assembly sub-branch, which is under the high court branch. All his allowances as an MLA were deposited into this account.Banerjee, who is now an MP from Serampore, stated that there were no transactions in this old account for a long time, rendering it a 'dormant' account. The fraudsters exploited this account for their scheme. Banerjee said the manager of the HC branch called him up on Thursday to inform him about the fraud.Police suspect that using the MP's photo and mobile number, Rs 56 lakh was transferred from his Kalighat branch account to the 'dormant' account, and subsequently, the entire amount was withdrawn. ""The fraudster forged a PAN and Aadhaar card by superimposing a different image on the apparently genuine documents.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Friday accused India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of committing a ""historic sin"" by truncating certain parts of Vande Matram which hailed Goddess Durga.In a social media post on X, BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan said that Congress, under Nehru's presidentship, adopted only a truncated Vande Mataram as the party’s national song in its 1937 Faizpur session. He also cited Nehru's letter to Subhash Chandra Bose where Nehru said that Vande Matram has nothing to do with Goddess Durga and opines that Vande Mataram is not suitable as a national song.""It is imperative for our younger generation to know how the Congress party brazenly pandering to its communal agenda under the Presidentship of Nehru, adopted only a truncated Vande Mataram as the party’s national song in its 1937 Faizpur Session, while PM Narendra Modi today will inaugurate the 150th year commemoration & participate in the mass recital of the full version of our glorious Vande Mataram across the nation,"" Kesavan said.""The glorious Vande Mataram became the voice of our nation’s unity and solidarity, celebrating our motherland, instilling nationalistic spirit and fostering patriotism. Chanting it was made a criminal offense by the British. It did not belong to any particular religion or language. But the Congress committed the historic sin and blunder of linking the song with religion. Congress under Nehru citing religious grounds deliberately removed stanzas of Vande Mataram which hailed Goddess Ma Durga,"" he added.The BJP leader also attacked leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, claiming that ""Hindu Virodhi mentality"" of Nehru finds a pungent echo in Congress leader's recent remarks on Chatth Puja.""In a letter dated Sep 1, 1937, Nehru spitefully writes that anybody considering the words in Vande Mataram as anything to do with a Goddess was absurd. He also derisively opines that Vande Mataram is not suitable as a national song. Netaji Subash Bose had strongly advocated for the full original version of Vande Mataram. On Oct 20, 1937 Nehru wrote to Netaji Bose claiming that the background of Vande Mataram was likely to irritate Muslims. He went on to say that there does seem to be substance regarding outcry against Vande Mataram and people who are communalistically inclined have been affected by it,"" he said.""In 1937 if Nehru as Congress president blanked out the mention of Goddess Ma Durga by truncating Vande Mataram, Rahul Gandhi in March 2024 maliciously remarked ‘ There is a word called Shakti in Hindu Dharma and we are fighting against Shakti’. The Hindu Virodhi mentality of Nehru finds a pungent echo in Rahul Gandhi who recently demeaned and maligned the sacred Chatth Puja as a drama, hurting the sentiments of crores of devotees,"" he added.This comes as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to launch year long celebrations to commemorate 150 years of national song at Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium on Friday. He will also release a commemorative stamp and coin during the event.The programme will mark the formal launch of the year-long nationwide commemoration of the composition that inspired India's freedom movement and continues to evoke national pride and unity.Composed by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, 'Vande Mataram' was first published in the literary journal 'Bangadarshan' on November 7, 1875.""Later, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee incorporated the hymn in his immortal novel 'Anandamath' which was published in 1882. It was set to music by Rabindranath Tagore. It has become an integral part of the nation's civilisational, political and cultural consciousness,"" a government statement said.","Bharatiya janata party accuses india's first prime minister jawaharlal nehru of committing a ""historic sin"" by truncating certain parts of vande matram.

Supreme Court Directs Dogs Be Shifted From Schools, Bus Stands To Shelters; Petitioner Breaks Down

'Stray dogs not to be released back to site from where they are picked up'





Also read:

NEW DELHI: Noting that India continues to report one of the world's highest rabies-related mortality rates and there has been an alarming increase in dog-bite incidents, making public places unsafe, Supreme Court Friday directed that stray dogs be removed from premises of educational institutions, hospitals, sports complexes, bus stands and depots, and railway stations. The court made it clear the authority concerned will face consequences for non-compliance.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria said the ""menace of dog bites"", particularly in public and private institutions that serve as spaces of learning, healing and recreation, is a matter of human safety, and govts are under an obligation to protect life and health of citizens.In its order, the bench mentioned incidents of dog bites which grabbed headlines recently, including a Welsh entrepreneur being bitten during a morning run in Bengaluru and two coaches (from Kenya and Japan) being bitten in Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. Similar incidents in educational institutions, railway stations and hospitals were highlighted, including at Kannur railway station, where a rabid stray reportedly bit 18 people on a platform.It shall be the responsibility of the jurisdictional municipal body/authority to forthwith remove every stray dog found within the premises of an educational institution, hospital (public or private), sports complex, bus stand/depot (including inter-state bus terminals) or railway station, and to shift such animal/s to a designated shelter, after due sterilisation and vaccination, in accordance with the Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules, 2023,"" the bench said.""Stray dogs so picked up shall not be released back to the same location from which they were picked up. We have consciously directed the non-release of such stray dogs to the same location from which they were picked up, as permitting the same would frustrate the very effect of the directions issued to liberate such institutional areas from the presence of stray dogs,"" it said.No sooner had the bench read out the operating part of its order in open court than animal activists and dog lovers urged it not to sign the judgment and requested it to grant them a hearing. However, the bench turned down the request.It directed that the management or administrator of such institutions shall designate a nodal officer for the upkeep and cleanliness of premises, and ensuring that stray dogs do not enter or inhabit the campus. ""The recurrence of such incidents, particularly within institutional spaces meant for learning, healing and recreation, reflects not only administrative apathy but also a systemic failure to secure these premises from preventable hazards,"" the bench said.The situation calls for immediate judicial intervention to safeguard the fundamental right to life and safety of citizens, especially children, students, patients and sportspersons, it said.The directions, SC said, are being issued in continuation of and in furtherance of its order, dated Aug 22, to ensure that the menace of stray dog attacks within institutional areas is curbed through effective preventive and administrative mechanisms. ""The primary objective is to safeguard the fundamental right to life and safety of citizens...while ensuring compliance with the principles embodied in the ABC Rules, framed under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act,"" it said.It also directed chief secretaries of states and UTs to implement its direction and file status reports after eight weeks. The Animal Welfare Board has been directed to file a report on the nationwide status of sterilisation and vaccination drives as well as formulation of uniform standard operating procedures for prevention of dog-bite incidents. ""Any reported non-compliance of any of the above directions shall be viewed very seriously and may invite penalties/consequences including but not limited to the initiation of suo motu contempt proceedings against erring officials,"" the bench said.It said the administrative heads of these institutions shall through their respective local or municipal authorities, under the overall supervision of the district magistrate, ensure that premises are secured by fencing, boundary walls, gates and other such structures, or administrative measures as may be necessary to prevent the ingress of stray dogs.","India has one of the world's highest rabies-related mortality rates.

Probe suggests SI Kumar died of head injury, say police



HISAR: A police officer was beaten to death allegedly by hooligans outside his home in Haryana's Hisar late Thursday. Sub-inspector Ramesh Kumar, 57, tried to stop the assailants from creating a ruckus in the neighbourhood but was allegedly battered with bricks and sticks. The officer's nephew was also injured in the attack. Police have arrested five suspects.Kumar was posted in the office of ADGP, Hisar range, and lived with his family. Around 11 pm, a group of men parked themselves on the street outside his home and began drinking and using abusive language.The sub-inspector asked the hooligans not to create a nuisance in a residential area. The group dispersed but returned 20 minutes later with a few more men and began creating a ruckus again. When SI Ramesh Kumar stepped out to confront the men, they set upon him and allegedly bludgeoned him with bricks and construction debris. The SI's nephew Amit Kumar rushed out to protect him but he too was attacked by the hooligans.When some neighbours stepped out after hearing their screams, the attackers fled, leaving behind a car and a couple of two-wheelers on which they had arrived. Both victims were rushed to Hisar general hospital, where doctors declared Ramesh dead on arrival.Amit is under treatment. Word quickly spread that a cop had been murdered. Additional director general of police KK Rao and SP Shashank Kumar Sawan rushed to the spot and inspected the scene.Multiple teams were sent after the accused.

VIP counts on consolidation in the end

A peculiar contest has emerged in Darbhanga’s Gaura Bauram constituency. Amid uncertainty and confusion during seat-sharing within the Mahagathbandhan, RJD had initially allotted the ticket to Afzal Ali Khan. Later, the seat was handed over to Mukesh Sahni’s VIP. Sahni then fielded his younger brother Santosh Sahni from here but Afzal Ali refused to withdraw. Treating this as indiscipline, RJD yesterday expelled Afzal Ali for six years with immediate effect.This sets up a potential split in the Muslim vote between Afzal Ali and Santosh Sahni, this could end up benefiting the BJP.BJP has fielded former IRS officer Sujeet Kumar Singh.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday accused Congress of “removing important stanzas” from the original Vande Mataram while adopting it during party's 1937 Faizabad session. PM Modi said that the decision not only “broke the song into pieces” but also “sowed the seeds of partition.”Speaking at an event marking 150 years of the national song ‘Vande Mataram’ at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium, PM Modi said, “Unfortunately, in 1937, important stanzas were removed from the original Vande Bharat song. Vande Bharat was broken into pieces. This also sowed the seeds of partition. Why was this injustice done? The same divisive ideology remains a challenge for the nation.”The Prime Minister said the song continues to inspire generations and called upon the youth to remain focused on building a Viksit Bharat despite attempts to mislead them. “On our way to Viksit Bharat, we will find people who misguide us. People with a pessimistic outlook will try to sow doubt in our minds. In such times, Vande Mataram inspires us. How can a mother who has crores of children be weak? Bharat Mata has 140 crore children, has 280 crore arms, and more than 60% are young. We have the world’s biggest demographic advantage. Nothing is impossible for us,” he said.Meanwhile, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge accused the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) of saying those celebrating Vande Mataram’s anniversary have never sung it in their offices or shakhas.“It is deeply ironic that those who today claim to be the self-proclaimed guardians of nationalism — the RSS and the BJP — have never sung Vande Mataram or our National Anthem Jana Gana Mana in their shakhas or offices. Instead, they continue to sing Namaste Sada Vatsale, a song glorifying their organisations, not the nation,” Kharge said in an official statement.He added, “Since its founding in 1925, the RSS has avoided Vande Mataram, despite its universal reverence. Not once in its texts or literature does the song find mention.”Kharge also drew a contrast with Congress traditions, noting that Vande Mataram has been part of every party meeting and event since 1986. “The Congress Party takes immense pride in both Vande Mataram and Jana Gana Mana. Both songs are sung with reverence at every Congress gathering and event, symbolising India’s unity and pride,” he said.Continuing his criticism, Kharge accused the Sangh of having “stood with the British” during India’s independence movement. “It is a well-known fact that the RSS and Sangh Parivar supported the British against Indians in the National Movement, did not raise the National Flag for 52 years, abused the Constitution of India, burnt effigies of Bapu and Babasaheb Ambedkar, and, in the words of Sardar Patel, were involved in Gandhiji’s assassination,” Kharge said.Recalling the song’s history, the Congress president said the party had been the “proud flagbearer of Vande Mataram” since the late 19th century. “It was during the 1896 session of the Congress in Calcutta, under the leadership of the then Congress President Rahmatullah Sayani, that Vande Mataram was sung publicly for the first time by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore. That moment infused new life into the freedom struggle,” Kharge said.He added that Vande Mataram emerged as a song of unity and defiance against the British policy of divide and rule. “The Congress understood that the British Empire’s manipulation of religious, caste, and regional identities was designed to break India’s unity. Against this, Vande Mataram rose as a song of unflinching strength, uniting all Indians in devotion to Bharat Mata,” he said.Recalling the circumstances under which Vande Mataram was written, PM Modi said Bankim Chandra Chatterjee composed it when India was struggling under British rule and economic exploitation. “When Bankim Babu composed Vande Mataram, India was far removed from its golden era. Foreign invaders, their attacks and the exploitative policies of the British had left our country in the clutches of poverty and starvation. Even in those dire circumstances, Bankim Babu called for a prosperous India,” he said.“During that period of slavery, the British justified their rule by portraying India as inferior and backward. The first line (Sujalam, Suphalam) completely destroyed that propaganda. Vande Mataram not only became the song of independence, but also presented that prosperous, fruitful dream of what an independent India would be like,” PM Modi added.The Prime Minister quoted Rabindranath Tagore’s remarks on Bankim Chandra’s Anandamath, describing it as more than just a novel. “Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore once said that Bankim Chandra’s ‘Anandmath’ is not just a novel. It is a dream of an independent India. Every word written by Bankim Babu had deep meaning. This song was created during the time of slavery, but it is not limited to that time. The Vande Bharat song is relevant in every era. One-fourth share of global GDP was with India just a few centuries ago,” he said.Highlighting India’s civilisational ethos, PM Modi said the idea of the nation as a mother has been deeply rooted in Indian tradition. “Our Vedas have taught us that the nation is our mother and we are her children. We have worshipped our nation in this form since the Vedic period. The emotion that a nation can be a mother can be surprising for those who view nations as a geopolitical entity. But India is different. Here, a nation is also the one that gives birth and the one that nurtures. She is also a destroyer if a child is in danger. Because of this emotion of considering the nation as mother and a form of Shakti, mahila shakti was forefront in building the nation,” PM Modi said.He added, “The concept of India is the ideological force behind it. The sense of one's independent existence. Only from the depths of the heart and the infinity of emotions does a composition like Vande Mataram emerge. In that period of slavery, Vande Mataram became the proclamation of this resolve. And that proclamation was of India's independence. The chains of slavery would be broken by the hands of Mother India, and her children would become the makers of their own destiny. ”Calling the day a moment of national pride, PM Modi said, “Today, November 7, is a historic day. We are having a grand celebration of 150 years of the creation of Vande Mataram. This event will generate new energy among crores of Indians. My greeting to every citizen on the 150th anniversary of Vande Mataram.”Earlier in the day, BJP spokesperson C.R. Kesavan accused former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of committing a “historic sin” by truncating stanzas from Vande Mataram that hailed Goddess Durga during the 1937 Faizpur session of the Congress. He claimed Nehru’s letter to Subhash Chandra Bose from that year described the hymn as unsuitable for adoption as a national song.Kesavan alleged that the Congress “deliberately removed” the Durga stanzas to appease communal sentiments. He also drew a link between Nehru’s position and Rahul Gandhi’s recent remarks on Shakti, calling it a continuation of a “Hindu Virodhi mentality.”The government has announced a year-long celebration to mark the 150th anniversary of ‘Vande Mataram’, including the release of a commemorative stamp and coin.‘Vande Mataram’, composed by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, was first published in 1875 in the journal ‘Bangadarshan’ and later included in his novel ‘Anandamath’. The song was set to music by Rabindranath Tagore and became a rallying cry during India’s freedom struggle.",Pm modi calls vande mataram a ‘mantra of unity and courage’ as the song completes 150 years.

Accommodated request twice, AG not being fair to court: CJI





NEW DELHI: Unaffected by the rebuke from Supreme Court for seeking reference of petitions challenging the validity of the Tribunal Reforms Act to a five-judge bench half-way through the final hearing in the matter, attorney general R Venkataramani made a fresh request for adjournment on Thursday, upsetting CJI B R Gavai, who wondered why the top law officer wasn't being direct enough to seek adjournment of the hearing beyond Nov 24, when a new CJI assumes office.Venkataramani, who had already been granted two adjournments to enable him to participate in an international arbitration proceeding, through ASG Aishwarya Bhati, requested the bench to adjourn the hearing scheduled for Friday to Monday.The CJI, who on Nov 3 had refused to accept the Centre’s application seeking reference of the case to a five-judge bench and termed it as an attempt to drag the matter beyond his retirement date of Nov 23, told Bhati that the AG is “not being fair to the court” despite the bench, also including Justices K Vinod Chandran and Vipul Pancholi, accommodating his request for adjournment twice in the past.“If you want to have the hearing after Nov 24 (when Justice Surya Kant takes over as CJI), you should frankly say that,” the CJI said, adding that “every now and then it is told to us that the AG is busy with international arbitration and yet the Centre comes out with a midnight application seeking reference of the case midway through the final hearing to a five-judge bench.”“We have highest regard for the office of the highest law officer.But when we were practising in HCs, we used to give up cases if we were engaged in a part-heard matter before any bench to enable the HC to complete the hearing as scheduled,” CJI remarked. Though the CJI reluctantly agreed to adjourn the case to Monday, he pointed out that the bench needed enough time to write the judgment. The petitions before SC challenged the provisions of the Tribunal Reforms Act which put in place a uniform tenure of four years for the chairperson and members of different tribunals, even though SC had ruled that the tenure should be of five years.On Nov 3, the bench had said, “We did not expect the Union govt to indulge in such tactics. After we have heard the petitioners fully, the Union govt cannot be permitted to take the plea for reference to a larger bench.” However, it clarified that “if on consideration of the arguments, we arrive at a conclusion that the matter involves substantial questions of law requiring reference to a 5-J bench, we will do so”.","Cji gavai: accommodated request twice, ag not being fair to court: cji.

"It’s time to reform sale/purchase of immovable property to make it simple, fraud free: SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/its-time-to-reform-sale/purchase-of-immovable-property-to-make-it-simple-fraud-free-sc/articleshow/125164323.cms,"Supreme court

NEW DELHI: Observing that sale or purchase of immovable property is a distressing and traumatic task fraught with risk of fraud as it is still regulated by colonial laws, Supreme Court on Friday said the time has come to reform the procedure to make it simpler, transparent and fraud free by use of technology and making property registration a conclusive proof of ownership.A bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Joymalya Bagchi said property laws have long witnessed dichotomy between registration and ownership as registration does not confer ownership and this leads to massive litigation, which is 66 per cent of all civil disputes in the country. It said the problem could be addressed by achieving convergence of conclusive titling with registration, which is now possible due to technological advancement.Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Narasimha said more than a century has passed and the country must dare to think and look for alternatives. The efficiency and transparency with which immovable property is bought and sold is demonstrative of a nation’s institutional maturity and a testament of the confidence and trust its citizens repose in the integrity of its legal framework, he said. The judgement can be a turning point in bringing much needed reform in transaction of real estate propertiesSC passed the order while quashing the Bihar govt’s decision to make ‘jamabandi’ — holding allotment — of a land mandatory before its transfer or sale.The court appreciated the intention of the state to synchronise the registrable document with real-time land holding but said the process of mutation and the process of survey and settlement are nowhere near completion.“Under these circumstances and considering the nascent stage at which the empirical data is translated as mutation into the relevant records, and the fact that for this purpose survey and settlement are to be conducted, interlinking and restraining registration till jamabandi is effected would be illegal, as it has a direct impact on the right and freedom to purchase and sale property,"" the bench said.SC said the present legal framework for purchase and sale of immovable properties suffers from several systemic deficiencies that undermine reliability, transparency and efficiency. It asked the Centre and the Law Commission to examine use of technology such as Blockchain in sale or purchase of property as it would address the problems related to fake and fraudulent property documents, land encroachments, role of intermediaries etc.“Fortunately, due to technological advancement this process is duly and more accurately achievable. We have incorporated emerging technologies as instruments of institutional reform. Blockchain technology has garnered particular attention for its potential to transform land registration into a more secure, transparent and tamper-proof system,” the bench said.“It is suggested that adoption of the technology would ensure immutability, transparency and traceability, thereby minimising fraud and unauthorised alterations. The technology is said to offer an alternative paradigm by encoding land titles, ownership histories, encumbrances, and by recording transfers on a ‘Distributed Ledger’ in an immutable and time stamped form,” it said.SC said each entry, once validated into the ‘Distributed Ledger, becomes part of a cryptographically linked chain of information that cannot be retroactively altered without detection, and this cryptographic immutability could perhaps address the structural fragility of the Indian record keeping system. “The Blockchain design could integrate cadastral maps, survey data and revenue records into a single verifiable framework, which, while maintaining a transparent audit trail, is accessible to multiple departments and the public,” it said.",Supreme court quashes bihar govt’s decision to make ‘jamabandi’ — holding allotment — of a land mandatory before its transfer or sale.

'Up and functional': Airports Authority's update on technical glitch in Delhi; flight operations to be normal soon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/over-300-flights-hit-technical-snag-triggers-chaos-at-delhi-airport-key-developments/articleshow/125157720.cms,"Massive ATC System Breakdown At Delhi Airport Disrupts Flights; Airlines Urge Patience And Care

What failed: AMSS breakdown and impact on flight-plan distribution

Scale of disruption: Number of flights delayed and average wait times

From automated to manual

Restoration efforts and status updates

The Airports Authority of India said that the air traffic control messaging system (AMSS) at Delhi airport was ""up and functional"", after a technical glitch disrupted over 800 flights. However, it said that due to ""some backlogs, there may be some delays in the normal functioning of automated operations"".""The AMSS systems are up and functional now. Due to some backlogs, there may be some delays in the normal functioning of automated operations, but the situation will be normal soon,"" it said in a post on X.Chaos erupted at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport on Friday after a glitch in the AMSS system caused over 800 flight delays, PTI reported citing sources. At least 20 flights have been cancelled, according to the report. The Mumbai airport also issued a statement announcing that its air traffic was impacted due to the malfunction.The glitch occurred in the AMSS system that prompted the ATC to abandon automation and switch to manual procedures. The slowdown began showing network-wide effects from Thursday afternoon.As India’s busiest hub, IGIA typically manages about 1,500 aircraft movements a day with peak rates near 60–70 per hour in normal conditions, leaving little slack when automation falters.The problem started at the Automatic Message Switching System, a system responsible for transferring the flight plan data to the air traffic controllers' screens, which crashed. This caused the controllers to process each data manually, significantly delaying the arrival and departure process. The disruption that began to impact the operations since Thursday 3pm, had been occurring since Wednesday evening.The technical failure has affected more than 100 flight operations as per PTI. The glitch has largely increased the wait times for all the passengers at the airport. The airport officials have assured the passengers that resolution efforts are under way.Air traffic control oversees aircraft movements in the sky and on the ground, keeping safe separation and efficient air traffic flow. The system that ingests flight plans, tracks positions, and streams real-time data to controllers’ consoles is automated. The Auto Track System presents this live picture to controllers for sequencing departures, arrivals, and taxi movements, while the Automatic Message Switching System (AMSS) relays high-volume flight plans, weather, and operational notices between ATC and airlines each day.Since these automated layers went down with technical failures, controllers were forced to shift to manual methods—noting flight details by hand, calculating separation standards, and coordinating via voice circuits—which preserves safety but greatly reduces throughput and creates operational choke points compared with normal automated rates.Announcing the expected delays due to manual processing, Airport Authority of India shared a post on their X on Friday stating, ""Flight operations at Delhi Airport are experiencing delays due to a technical issue in the Automatic Message Switching System (AMSS), which supports Air Traffic Control data. Controllers are processing flight plans manually, leading to some delays. Technical teams are working to restore the system at the earliest. ""Delhi Airport also shared the announcement on its Instagram. It assured the passengers of addressing the matter on a priority basis and asked them to stay in touch with their respective airlines for further advisories. ""We regret the disruption being experienced at IGIA due to a technical issue at ATC that is affecting flight operations. This matter is being addressed on priority with close coordination among ATC, DIAL, and other stakeholders. Passengers are requested to follow updates from their airlines regarding revised schedules. Thank you for your cooperation,"" it wrote.Following the disruptions, various airlines issued advisories for their respective flyers. IndiGo announced that the AMSS system is being resolved and shared a link for the passengers to check the latest flight status before flying. ""Customers with upcoming departures are advised to check the latest flight status before starting their journey and to arrive at the airport a little earlier than usual to allow additional time for travel formalities,"" IndiGo wrote.SpiceJet assured its flyers that, amidst the delay chaos, its ground staff is present at the airport to assist the passengers. ""Our crew and ground teams are assisting passengers and working closely with the authorities to minimise the impact and resume normal operations as soon as possible,"" they wrote further, asking the passengers to keep checking the flight status.Air India, while regretting for the delay, also asked the passengers to keep in touch with the updates about their flights so that they could efficiently manage their travel time. ""Our cabin crew and on-ground staff at the airport are extending immediate assistance to reduce passenger inconvenience,"" they wrote, ""We request you to check your flight status before heading to the airport.""Akasa Air announced the longer wait times at the airport for the passengers as the situation was beyond their control. ""This may lead to longer wait times at the airport and delays for some of our flights. While this situation is beyond our control, we sincerely regret the inconvenience to your travel plans and seek your understanding during these times,"" read its post on X.Air India Express also shared a notice asking for patience and advising passengers to check the flight status before heading to the airport.

BUDGAM: J&K CM Omar Abdullah Friday attacked the PDP , accusing it of betraying people’s trust in 2014 by joining hands with the BJP after the assembly polls to form the govt in the state.He was addressing a gathering in Budgam, the assembly constituency going to vote in the bypoll on November 11. Omar had vacated the seat he won in last year’s assembly polls in the state along with his traditional seat of Ganderbal.“This seat will have no impact on the NC government, but we cannot overlook its significance. This election can send out several important messages,” he said.“A year ago, my colleagues and I asked you to vote for me so that we could keep the BJP out of power and form our own government. The people accepted that appeal and gave us their mandate, and we have remained steadfast in our principles, staying away from the BJP,” he said.“Earlier, another party also sought votes on the same slogan,” Omar said. “In 2014 our rival PDP asked people to vote for them to keep the BJP out. And from Qazigund to Kupwara, people did so. But they betrayed that trust. The very next day, PDP joined hands with BJP and formed the govt.”The CM blamed the PDP-BJP alliance of 2014-2015 for the political changes that followed in J&K, including the abrogation of Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019, and downgrading of J&K from a state to a union territory.“What happened in 2019 and after was because of that alliance,” Omar said.The CM said that had the NC, like PDP, formed a governmentt with BJP after last year’s elections, Jammu and Kashmir could have become a state. “But I was not ready to deceive my mandate,” he said.Despite being a UT CM, Omar said, his govt has carried out developmental works in the region. “I vacated the Budgam seat because the law does not allow holding two constituencies. But I have continued to work for Budgam,” he said, announcing that Budgam would be developed as a model assembly constituency and that a university would be established here.There are three main contestants in Budgam — NC’s Aga Syed Mehmood, PDP’s Aga Syed Muntazir Mehdi, and BJP’s Aga Syed Mohsin. With NC MP Aga Ruhullah, a former MLA from Budgam, staying away from the party’s campaign and accusing the leadership of abandoning the struggle for the restoration of Article 370, the NC is pushing hard to win the seat to send a message to both the PDP and its own dissenting MP that it remains popular among the people.","J&k cm omar abdullah accuses pdp of betraying people’s trust in 2014.

Sprinkling being done across city to suppress dust: Sirsa

NEW DELHI: As smog thickens in Delhi and people complain of burning eyes, scratchy throats and breathing problems, are the official air quality monitors accurately reflecting the capital's air quality? A ground check by TOI at several stations found glaring inconsistencies and questionable practices that may be influencing readings.At Anand Vihar - a pollution hot spot - the area around the monitoring unit was being repeatedly doused with water using high-pressure hoses. The practice, officials on site said, was part of routine dust suppression. Experts said such measures can distort readings.At Dilshad Garden, the AQI was in 'poor' zone but better than most other spots in the afternoon. The station is deep in a forested patch of a medical institute - covered by trees and away from the city dust and traffic.Similarly, the Mandir Marg station stood within a green belt and remained largely inaccessible, while at ITO, the monitor was located next to a regularly sprinkled stretch.At Lodhi Road, two stations barely a few blocks from each other, gave readings that differed by as much as 80 points at the same time.These observations raise serious questions over the credibility and representativeness of the capital's air quality network.Delhi environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa, however, defended the data. ""How would we suppress the dust? It's natural, through sprinkling. It is being done throughout the city, including around stations. We are successfully able to control pollution,"" he said. Experts, meanwhile, warned that excessive sprinkling near stations is ""unethical"" and could mislead both policymakers and the public.""These are state-of-the-art stations approved by all relevant agencies, designed to capture air quality over a two to three kilometre radius,"" said M P George, former additional director, Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC). ""They measure a well-mixed air package, so cleaning one small patch doesn't change the bigger picture."" He added that while there's no concrete study linking water sprinkling to altered AQI readings, such actions increase humidity and are more cosmetic than corrective. ""In fact, they can be counterproductive - higher humidity promotes secondary particulate formation. Sprinkling near monitors serves no scientific purpose.""Manoj Kumar from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) agreed that sprinkling may briefly lower particulate levels near sensors but said it doesn't change overall air quality. ""The worst pollution peaks occur in early morning and late evening, when sprinkling doesn't happen. So, while readings may look cleaner for a few hours, overall exposure remains hazardous,"" he said.Sunil Dahiya, founder of Envirocatalysts, said there was no evidence of post-collection data tampering but the choice of locations - often inside green or shielded areas - and nearby sprinkling clearly influence results. ""Such practices give a false sense of safety and prevent citizens, especially vulnerable groups, from taking precautions. They also distort forecasting and policy responses.""Environmental activist Bhavreen Kandhari went a step further, calling it a case of ""cleaning data, not air."" ""These sensors measure pollution through light scattering. When mist or water is sprayed nearby, it suppresses dust and alters humidity, creating an artificially 'clean' AQI that may appear 50-90% better for a few hours. It's detectable - sudden humidity spikes and abrupt PM2.5 drops are red flags. When this happens under official watch, it's data distortion, not management,"" she said.Lawyer and environmentalist Akash Vashishtha said air pollution control must be rooted in accuracy, not optics. ""Prevention, control and abatement can only work when data is truthful. Hiding reality doesn't bring relief - it delays real solutions. The govt must ensure monitors are placed in representative, high-footfall and industrial areas, not in pockets of greenery,"" he said.",Toi at several stations found glaring inconsistencies and questionable practices that may be influencing readings.
