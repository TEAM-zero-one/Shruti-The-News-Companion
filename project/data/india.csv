TOI’s Akhilesh Singh

Prasenjit Mund

PM Narendra Modi has spoken of turning India into a $5 trillion economy. What would be MP’s contribution to it?

Where do you see MP tomorrow in terms of industry?

Investment promises are part of every such summit. How will you ensure that plans turn into reality?

What are your plans to decentralise development and take it to small towns and villages?

What inspired you to personally tour cities and hardsell Madhya Pradesh as an investment destination?

Madhya Pradesh won seven Krishi Karman Awards. Do you see the state winning industry accolades too?

How will you convince industrialists about MP’s ease of doing business?

MP has had political stability for a long time, and this is a major area of operation for BJP and RSS. Do you see this as an opportunity or a challenge?

‘Double-engine govt’ is a much talked about phrase. How has it benefited Madhya Pradesh?

What is the status of MP’s river-linking projects?

Your govt has banned liquor at 19 religious sites and you said this was the first step. Is your govt working towards prohibition, and if so, is there a timeline?

Will you move in the same direction?

If you had to pick the top three industrial sectors as ones with the biggest potential for MP’s growth, which would they be?

Would you be willing to reduce power tariffs for industries?

Congress was once strong here, but has been weakened drastically. Don’t you think a weak opposition is not healthy for a democracy?

Congress is facing consequences of its ‘own karma’, saidin an exclusive interview withand. Criticising the opposition for its devotion to a single family, he suggests it should have democratised its structure instead. Ahead of hosting an investment summit in Bhopal, Yadav exuded confidence in the state’s turnaround■ We are working on PM Modi’s vision and aligning our work in the same direction. We aim to double our economy in 5 years. MP’s success will be counted in India’s growth story. PM Modi has said that India will be the third largest economy in the world. That can be possible only when every state contributes to achieving the vision. Our aim is to exceed expectations. We will keep striving towards this.■ We want to make MP the No. 1 state in the country. Our state has the potential and it has everything going for it. All that we need to do is to make the most of opportunities in the best interests of the state and our people. It’s not a one-day job. We have to persist with long-term vision and long-term goals. By tapping MP’s potential and bringing more investment, we want to stop the brain drain from the state. Bright youngsters from MP are leaving the state to work in other cities or abroad. We will ensure that they get enough opportunities here so that they can contribute to their home state’s growth.■ Earlier, things were limited to speeches and talk. We decided to work. We created new policies, tailormade for specific sectors, and threw open the state to investors. They will come only when they see the state has the wherewithal and the determination to keep its word. We know that it won’t work if we do this once and sit back. We have been at it. We held regional conclaves. I went out and held business meetings in India and abroad. When you do it every month, it becomes a part of work culture and becomes part of a system. It picks up momentum. Since we are present at so many platforms, we keep meeting industrialists. If someone promises an investment, they will keep running into us somewhere or the other and the project will, of course, come alive.■ Every region of Madhya Pradesh must grow and develop, which is why our plans encompass the entire state. Every district is unique, it has its own set of potentials and possibilities. The districts that are rich in minerals, can excel in mining. Where agriculture is bountiful, there can be farmbased growth. Spiritual sites have their inherent, almost autonomous economy of religious tourism. This, too, will grow in a big way. MP has tremendous potential in forests and wildlife tourism. We will augment infrastructure to make it even bigger. After all, we have cheetahs and the brand of ‘Tiger State’. Where roads and railway tracks are needed, we are taking care of it. We look at the needs of today and tomorrow, and are flexible in our approach. For instance, BRTS was adversely affecting Bhopal traffic, so we had it removed. What was yesterday’s need is past. We are planning for the future. And we are taking decisions swiftly. There is a big advantage in that.■ I learnt from PM Modi that when you sit in a position of responsibility, if you don’t project your vision and immerse yourself entirely in the effort to achieve it, you will not succeed. When I was chairman of tourism corporation, I followed this rule for myself. Until the seed ends its own existence, no new plant can grow. If one has a vision, one has to also lead the way. My presence makes a difference at such meets. I believe it imbibes faith and trust in the minds of investors. Besides, God’s blessings also come my way for the hard work.■ We are already winning awards. We have got a wards in mining, tourism and education. We are one of the fastest growing economies in the country. Our GDP in the 2023- 24 fiscal grew by nearly 9.4%. We have even been awarded for good governance. Our revenue reforms have been well appreciated. We are No. 1 in agriculture, and we will soon be known as an industry powerhouse.■ We have simplified the application and approval process. What took 28 permissions earlier, now requires only 10. Our intention is that when an investor thinks of coming to MP, they will have already made up their minds because of the environment they will get here. When an investor comes to us with a proposal, our aim is to give him all the clearances in 28 days, maximum. Earlier, it used to stretch on for six months to even a year. They would grow frustrated from the uncertainty. We have made things simpler.■ We gain a lot from the strength of our organisation. We work like a family. Our work happens not because of someone’s post or designation but from a meeting of minds. It’s an administrative necessity that I am chief minister, otherwise there are so many veteran leaders, more senior to me, who we respect and work with perfect understanding.■ Oh, we benefit greatly from it. We don’t have to even think twice on so many issues. Take GST. We get around Rs 1.25 lakh crore from the Centre on this account. If it wasn’t PM Modi’s sarkar, we couldn’t even think of so much funds, that too on time. In Ken-Betwa river-linking project — the first of its kind in the world — or the project to link Parbati, Kalisindh and Chambal (PKC) rivers, we are getting Rs 75,000 crore. We only have to pitch in with 10% of the project cost, 90% comes from the Centre. This is the power of ‘double engine’.■ Projects dragged on for 20 years but now Bhoomi-pujan has been performed and tenders have been issued. There’s a new culture that has developed under PM Modi. States used to fight with each other earlier whereas there should be solidarity. After all, we are part of the same country. Now we are working closely with Uttar Pradesh not only on this but also sharing solar energy. In PKC river-linking, 13 districts each in Rajasthan and MP will benefit. Our relations with Rajasthan are great. We have another major project on Tapti river with Maharashtra. The aim should be to find common ground and a way to work in tandem for the betterment of people. All this is possible because of double-engine sarkar.■ At many places in MP, we had haphazard liquor bans. I said liquor should be banned completely in religious places. No half measures. Like Ujjain, liquor was prohibited in only 1km periphery. I extended it to the entire corporation area. So too with Omkareshwar, Datia, Orchha, Panna… If it’s a panchayat, nagar parishad or municipality, the entire area will be freed of liquor.■ Who has seen the future?■ I can name 13. We are very strong in energy sector, in all three forms – thermal, pump-storage hydroelectricity, which is big these days, and renewable energy. We are doing a lot of good work in solar and wind energy. Electricity from MP is powering the Delhi Metro. We sell power at the cheapest rates — solar at just Rs 2.10 per unit, where the rest of the country is selling it for Rs 4. We are doing a service to the nation. Similarly, mining sector is huge for us. We have diamonds. And now even gold mines. We are a mineral-rich state. Agriculture has tremendous potential, of course. We aim to turn into a powerhouse in lithium-ion battery manufacturing. Pharma firms are lining up to come to MP. Our policies for start-ups and semiconductors are proving to be very attractive. Tourism is one of our strengths. We will do even better in this sector. We are the first in the country to launch air ambulance.■ We are giving industries so much benefit here, too. We encourage them to set up captive power plants.■ For that, Congress has to first believe in ‘lok-tantra’ (democracy). Congress believes in ‘parivar-tantra’ (dynastic politics). Four generations ruled after Independence, like Raja-Maharaja. Congress should think about it. BJP believes in a strong democracy. This is why no one from PM Narendra Modi’s family is no CM. No one from my family has ever been an MLA, minister or CM. It’s the same with Rajasthan CM Bhajan Lal and Odisha CM Mohan Charan Majhi. There is a long line of such leaders. We are flag-bearers of lok-tantra. Congress is paying a heavy price for it. It cannot shake off ‘parivarwaad’, which is why people are distancing themselves from it.",Madhya pradesh chief minister mohan yadav speaks exclusively to toi. He says the state is working on pm modi’s vision and aligning its work in the same direction. Yadav: we want to make mp the no. 1 state in the country.

Gupta, who secured a decisive victory in the recently concluded assembly elections from Shalimar Bagh, will take the oath of office on Thursday at Ramlila Maidan.A seasoned BJP leader, Gupta has held several key positions within the party. She previously served as the general secretary and president of the Delhi University Students' Union (DUSU) and is a member of the party’s national executive.

Cops: Supplementary chargesheets to come as probe progresses

BAREILLY: UP Police 's special investigation team in Sambhal submitted chargesheets in six cases related to the Nov 24 violence, totalling over 4,400 pages, on Thursday. Officials said their investigation revealed that Shariq Satha , a native of Sambhal who is believed to be in the UAE, orchestrated the violence that resulted in the deaths of five men and injuries to several others.Satha, who previously ran a car theft gang that stole over 300 vehicles from Delhi-NCR, is linked to Dawood Ibrahim and Pakistan's ISI, cops said, adding that he fled the country using a fake passport.Circle officer Kuldeep Kumar and additional district govt counsel Hari Om Prakash submitted the chargesheets in the court of chief judicial magistrate Archana Singh.

The chargesheets name 79 accused, all currently in jail, under various sections of BNS.Sambhal SP Krishan Kumar Bishnoi told TOI, “Satha’s involvement came to light during the investigation, and based on evidence recovered by us, we can say that he orchestrated the violence. Chargesheets include members of Satha’s gang. This is the first lot of chargesheets, and we will file a supplementary chargesheet as the investigation progresses.”The probe uncovered “unusual money transfers to account holders in Sambhal” and “foreign-made cartridges” at violence sites. According to officers, Satha’s associates were responsible for the gunfire that killed four of the five victims. No FIR was lodged for the fifth death.Asked about the chargesheet in which Samajwadi Party MP Ziaur Rahman Barq and local MLA Iqbal Mahmood’s son Suhail Iqbal were named, a senior officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, told TOI, “Satha has good political connections in Sambhal and neighbouring districts.

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Rekha Gupta and her ministers, sworn in on Thursday at a public function at Ramlila Maidan that was attended by PM Modi , Union ministers and many chief ministers, hit the ground running. Soon after a visit to the secretariat, the cabinet were on the Yamuna banks before convening for a meeting in the evening.The portfolios were announced at night. Among the key departments, Gupta will handle finance and revenue; Parvesh Verma PWD and water; Ashish Sood home, power, urban development and education; Manjinder Singh Sirsa industries and environment; Kapil Mishra law and justice; Dr Pankaj Kumar Singh health and transport; and Ravinder Indraj Singh social welfare.Vijender Gupta is likely to be the new Speaker.A hoarding of the CM and PM, positioned on opposite sides, served as the backdrop of the stage with 'Viksit Dilli Ka Shapath Samaroh' inscribed in the centre as lieutenant governor V K Saxena administered the oath to Gupta and her council of six ministers. She took the oath amid chants of ""Jai Shri Ram"" from a large crowd of party supporters.Sood incorporated his parents' names in the oath while Sirsa, a former Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) member, delivered his oath in Punjabi. The audience enthusiastically applauded Kapil Mishra, a Brahmin from Poorvanchal, when he took the oath.The cabinet composition reflects a careful balance of regional and caste representation, including Pankaj Singh, who is a Thakur from Poorvanchal, Indraj, who is a representative of the Scheduled Castes, and the chief minister, who is a Bania.Gupta, Sood, Singh and Indraj are first-time MLAs.The choice of venue was politically significant as it had witnessed the Jan Lokpal protests by anti-corruption activist Anna Hazare which eventually gave birth to AAP. This was the place where Arvind Kejriwal and his cabinet had been sworn in on Feb 14, 2015. Kejriwal had promised to rid the city of corruption and warned his party against ""ahankar"" (arrogance).Gupta, who became the fourth woman — and ninth overall — CM of the capital, offered prayers at Marghat Wale Hanuman Temple at Kashmere Gate before reaching the venue. She was followed in the swearing-in ceremony by New Delhi MLA Parvesh Verma who too drew enthusiastic cheers from the audience with some shouting, “Parvesh ji ko Jai Shri Ram”. Newly-elected MLAs Ashish Sood (Janakpuri), Dr Pankaj Singh (Vikaspuri), Manjinder Singh Sirsa (Rajouri Garden), Ravinder Indraj (Bawana) and Kapil Mishra (Karwal Nagar) followed.People had started gathering at the venue since early morning with many showing their support for Prime Minister Modi by wearing his masks and holding up his cutouts. Many were waving the Tricolour and party flags. A band performed patriotic and devotional melodies like ""Ram Aayenge to angna sajaenge"" and ""Aai watan"".Union home minister Amit Shah was among the first senior leaders to reach the venue, followed by BJP national president JP Nadda and Rajasthan chief minister Bhajan Lal Sharma. The loudest cheers were, of course, for Modi when he entered the stage with ministers, NDA leaders and others on the stage standing up to greet him. The PM and CM exchanged greetings with Gupta wearing a broad smile. Several women who have worked with Gupta in the party’s women’s wing had turned up in large groups to show their support to the chief minister.The event was also attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh, Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. The stage was a showcase of NDA unity with Bihar deputy CM Vijay Kumar Sinha, Rajasthan deputy CM Prem Chand Bairwa, Goa CM Pramod Sawant, Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu, Haryana CM Naib Singh Saini and Madhya Pradesh CM Mohan Lal Yadav also present on the stage.Spiritual leaders were also put centre stage at the event that concluded with the national anthem.Rajya Sabha MP from the Aam Aadmi Party, Swati Maliwal, whose relationship with the party turned bitter in recent times, and Congress’s Delhi president Devender Yadav were the only representatives of the Opposition.Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Modi conveyed his best wishes to Rekha Gupta on X. “Congratulations to Smt Rekha Gupta ji on taking oath as Delhi’s chief minister. She rose from the grassroots, being active in campus politics, state organisation, municipal administration, and now MLA as well as chief minister.

NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta and her ministers on Thursday hit the ground running with focus on ""Maa Yamuna."" The chief minister attended a grand ""Yamuna Aarti"" on Vasudev ghat before chairing her first cabinet meeting which announced implementation of the Ayushman Bharat scheme - one of the key poll promises made by BJP to the people of Delhi during elections.That ""clean Yamuna project"" was important for the BJP was evident from the fact that the process to start cleaning the river had started even before the government was formed. ""We want to make Maa Yamuna clean and free-flowing. This marks the beginning of the BJP's commitment,"" party's Delhi unit chief Virendra Sachdeva had said emphasising the government's dedication.Yamuna pollution has been one of the key election issues in Delhi for long. When Arvind Kejriwal became the chief minister in 2015 with a massive mandate, he promised to clean the Yamuna in 5 years. Ironically, ten years into power, he did little and in 2025 the people of Delhi turned to the BJP which promised a slew of measures in its manifesto to restore the lost glory of Yamuna river A month back, when the campaigning for assembly elections was at its peak, Kejriwal, who failed to live up to his promise of cleaning the Yamuna, added a completely new dimension to the Yamuna politics. The AAP chief accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna water that comes to Delhi.""BJP's Haryana government has poisoned the water in Yamuna. If this water would have entered Delhi only to be mixed with the drinking water, many people would have died in Delhi. It would have caused mass genocide,"" the former Delhi chief minister had then alleged.""A few countries use biological weapons to poison river water. But, the same has been done by the BJP government. They have done this to create chaos in Delhi so that the people of Delhi die and the blame comes on AAP. I want to tell BJP to not stoop this low,"" he also added.Clearly, this was an extreme which took everyone, even the people of Delhi, by surprise. BJP leader and former Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar claimed that Kejriwal's posioned water statement cost him very dear in elections. ""If he had not made such a statement, his party would have won 5-7 seats more,"" Khattar asserted, adding ""More than 40 per cent of Delhi's residents are from Haryana. This statement insulted people of Haryana and Delhi both.""Well, it would be difficult to quantify the extent of loss that the poison attack caused, one thing is sure that the people of Delhi did not buy the theory as the results showed.Interestingly, Arvind Kejriwal had also performed Yamuna Aarti at Gita ghat in November 2015 after becoming the chief minister to mark the beginning of his promise to clean the river. However, 10 years down the line Yamuna pollution was one of the key factors that led to his defeat. The BJP realises the importance of Yamuna in capital politics and that perhaps explains why Rekha Gupta did not want to miss the opportunity of sending out a strong message to people of Delhi on Day 1.","Delhi chief minister rekha gupta and her ministers on thursday hit the ground running with focus on ""maa yamuna"" the chief minister attended a grand ""yamuna aarti"" on vasudev ghat before chairing her first cabinet meeting.

Back to the 60s? Congress mulls making district units great again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/back-to-the-60s-congress-mulls-making-district-units-great-again/articleshow/118430292.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Adopting a back-to-basics approach in the face of prolonged political slump, Congress is mulling leaving major decision-making functions to its district units, the building blocks of the party organisation which have been marginalised in the recent decades.Sources said the idea of reorganising the party around District Congress Committees (DCCs) was discussed in the Wednesday meeting of the party brass, with office-bearers managing state units. While president Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi are learnt to have spoken about focusing on district units, ranging from strengthening its structure to promoting loyal workers, sources said the future decision on the issue may revolve around giving greater importance to DCCs.Sources said the party may make district units crucial in selection of candidates for elections. While the present process involves recommendations starting from DCCs and then moving to state units and then to the All India Congress Committee (AICC), the leadership believes there is greater centralisation, with marginalisation of the first recommending authority. Some said the party was organised around the districts in the 1960s, before the shift towards the AICC happened. Also, the leadership of district units may get greater say in strategy and campaign, with the party building on their inputs. While Congress mulls returning the political primacy to districts, the lesson has been learnt at a big cost. As an insider said, the party did not have its DCCs constituted in Haryana for over seven years, a key reason behind the failure to manage better in the recent assembly elections. The same has been true for many other states.""The idea is to give greater responsibility, along with accountability, to DCCs in decision making,"" a party manager said.With the recent assembly defeats providing a reality check to Congress after the euphoria of Lok Sabha results in which the opposition did better than expected, Rahul has urged the states' managers to strategise better to take on the resource-rich BJP. Sources said he warned that the party had become predictable, which was providing an advantage to the rivals. Rahul is said to have stressed the importance of being unpredictable, citing the example of Bharat Jodo Yatra, and urged them to come up with out-of-the-box ideas in states. The importance of unpredictability was likened by a neta to that of Shivaji's guerrilla warfare.",Congress is mulling leaving major decision-making functions to its district units.

In a letter addressed to residents of both the Valley and Hills, Bhalla called for an end to hostilities and a return to normalcy.He appealed particularly to the youth, urging them to voluntarily return looted or illegally possessed weapons to the nearest police station, security outpost, or camp. ""Your single act of returning these weapons can be a powerful gesture towards ensuring peace. I want to assure you that no punitive action would be initiated if such weapons are returned within the stipulated time. Thereafter, strict action will be taken for possession of such weapons,"" he warned.""People of Manipur, both in Valley and Hills, have suffered immense hardship for the last over 20 months due to a series of unfortunate incidents affecting peace and communal harmony. In the greater interest of restoring normalcy, so that people can return to their normal day-to-day activities, all communities in the State must come forward to ensure cessation of hostilities and maintenance of peace & order in the society,"" the governor said.The ultimatum comes amid ongoing violence and security operations in Manipur, where security forces have been conducting widespread crackdowns on militant groups. In recent operations, authorities have arrested multiple militants, including members of the United Kuki National Army and the banned Kangleipak Communist Party.Over the last two days, security forces seized a significant cache of arms and ammunition, including rifles, pistols, grenades, and mortars, from various districts. The rising stockpiling of illegal weapons has been a major concern for authorities, leading to repeated calls for disarmament.The imposition of President’s Rule in Manipur on February 13 has further intensified security measures in the state. The decision came following the resignation of chief minister N Biren Singh, who stepped down amid prolonged ethnic violence that has claimed over 250 lives since May 2023. The state government had earlier withdrawn from the Suspension of Operations (SoO) agreement with the Kuki National Army and other armed groups, leading to renewed clashes.The Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity (COCOMI), a Meitei civil society group, criticised the move as ""undemocratic"" and an attempt to destabilise the state further. In contrast, the Kuki Inpi, the apex body of Kuki tribes, welcomed it as a ""necessary intervention"" and reiterated their demand for a separate administration under Article 239(A) of the Constitution.","Manipur governor ajay kumar bhalla issued an ultimatum to the people of the state urging them to surrender illegally held weapons.

Why it's good to be a first-time MLA in BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-its-good-to-be-a-first-time-mla-in-bjp/articleshow/118419086.cms,"From left - Gujarat CM Bhupendra Patel, Delhi CM Rakhi Gupta and Rajasthan CM Bhajan Lal Sharma

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), on several occasions, has given reasons to believe that it is good to be a first-time MLA in assembly elections. Picking dark horses over front runners has been a consistent strategy by the BJP's top brass while choosing chief ministerial face in states the party has won, particularly after 2014.The BJP's first bet on a first-timer for the chief ministerial post was in 2014 when the party chose Manohar Lal Khattar to serve Haryana as CM.In 2014, Khattar was a first-time MLA, an unknown face in the state's politics who had surprised everyone by being handed the top post after BJP won 47 seats in the assembly election.Associated with the Rashtriya Swamsevak Sangh (RSS) for over four decades and BJP for 20 years, Khattar had worked as the organising secretary of BJP in Haryana and established his reputation as a key strategist for the party in the state.Khattar had worked closely with the PM when the latter was BJP in charge of Haryana in 1996. When Modi was contesting from Varanasi in the 2014 general elections, Khattar was in charge of 50 wards in the constituency.His ability to align and consolidate the non-Jat voters in favour of the BJP endeared him to the party even as the Jat community, which dominated the Haryana politics for a long period, strongly resented the BJP for reasons such as farming issues and Jat quota agitation.Another such surprise move by the party came in 2024 when it picked Bhajan Lal Sharma the chief minister of Rajasthan.Bhajan Lal Sharma, a general secretary in the BJP's state unit and a first-time MLA from Jaipur's Sanganer constituency, kept a low profile in the party before his sudden rise to the top post.Interestingly, when a group photo was taken at the BJP office ahead of the legislature party meeting, the photo showed Bhajan Lal Sharma in the very last row. However, during the Rajasthan legislature party meet Bhajan Lal was announced as the leader.Considered a hardcore RSS man, Sharma was actively involved in the agitation for the Ram temple in Ayodhya at the site where the Babri mosque stood. In 1992, he spent time in jail for this. That was around the beginning of his political career. Over the past 30 years, Sharma had held various posts in the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) and in the party organisation.The list of first-timers becoming CM only got longer on Wednesday when the BJP's top leadership backed Rekha Gupta for the Delhi CM post over Parvesh Verma who defeated Ex-Delhi CM Kejriwal in assembly elections.Rekha Gupta rose through the ranks of the RSS-affiliated outfit Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad. She has held key positions in government and the party.Gupta's political journey began in DUSU, in which she served as secretary in 1995-96, before winning the president's post in 1996-97 as an ABVP candidate. Her trajectory mirrors BJP's strategy of grooming leaders from grassroots movements.In a political purge that was seen as BJP's most audacious experiment, the party in 2021 replaced all 22 ministers from the erstwhile Vijay Rupani cabinet. The tsunami of transformation capped a frenetic six days for the state, starting with Rupani’s sudden resignation as CM. More surprising was the elevation of first-time MLA Bhupendra Patel to the chief ministership.Unanimously elected as the BJP legislature party leader, Bhupendra Patel made his way up in the state politics from the municipality level. His name was floated by outgoing CM Vijay Rupani himself.Fondly called 'Dada' by many, Patel (59) had contested his maiden assembly election from Ghatlodia constituency in Ahmedabad in 2017 and won it by a margin of over 1.17 lakh votes, which was a record during that election.BJP's move to pick CM face is not restricted to only MLAs, the party gave top post responsibility to Yogi Adityanath, who was MP from Gorakhpur, to serve as Uttar Pradesh CM in 2017.When it comes to selecting chief ministers, the BJP's script has been the same - state after state. Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Odisha, Gujarat, Haryana - all these BJP-ruled states have chief ministers who were relatively unknown figures in the party till they were picked to lead the state.The heavyweights and the frontrunners in these states lost the race to the top post. This also helps the BJP in delivering the message that a grassroots leader with an apolitical backdrop can reach the helm of electoral politics.",Picking dark horses over front runners has been a consistent strategy by the bjp's top brass. The bjp's first bet on a first-timer for the chief ministerial post was in 2014 when the party chose manohar lal khattar to serve haryana as cm. Another such surprise move by the party came in 2024 when it picked bhajan lal sharma the chief minister of rajasthan.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118422608,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1577912,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

The court also directed Mhada and the Nashik deputy collector (urban land ceiling) to take measures to cancel allotment of the flats after the appeals period was over.On a plea moved later, the court granted bail to the NCP functionary and his brother to enable them to appeal against their conviction before a sessions court in Nashik. Under the Representation of the People Act, a legislator attracts disqualification if convicted for two years or more, unless the conviction is stayed.Kokate is the second minister of Ajit Pawar's NCP to face the heat after Dhananjay Munde, who is under attack in the murder case of Massajog sarpanch in Beed district.Kokate, who was in court, later told reporters, ""It's a 30-year-old politically motivated case. Then MLA and former minister Tukaram Dighole raised the matter, and a police complaint was registered against me by a govt official. I haven't yet read the judgment but we will certainly file an appeal.""The court said, ""The accused no.1 at the time of the alleged incident was having post in a political party... also, he is an advocate and now he is a minister in agriculture department... therefore such approach of accused no.1 for getting the flats at a low rate by concealing information regarding his income is highly dreadful (sic).""","Manikrao kokate and his brother, vijay, convicted and sentenced to two years' rigorous imprisonment for securing a flat each in 1995 under the state govt's 10% housing quota for economically weaker sections.
