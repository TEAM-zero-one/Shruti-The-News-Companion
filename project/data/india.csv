Why India’s betting on new tactic against digital arrest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-indias-betting-on-new-tactic-against-digital-arrest/articleshow/126211416.cms,"AI image

Central teeth for national problem

Banking, telecom breaches

What’s the counterpunch?

Over to CBI

As another year winds down, a cybercrime epidemic of mindboggling proportions continues unabated in India. Striking with impunity and alarming frequency, there is seemingly no tactic that’s too bizarre and no target that’s out of reach for cyber fraudsters. Earlier this year, a doctor in Gujarat was kept under video surveillance for three months, reportedly losing Rs 19 crore during her digital-arrest ordeal. More recently, a former Punjab Police IG was defrauded of more than Rs 8 crore in an investment scam. The shock led him to shoot himself in the chest.While the law of the land does not specifically recognise the concept of “digital arrest”, cases are reported every day from across India — mostly, instances of cybercriminals impersonating police and central security officials and using panic and manipulation to wipe people’s bank accounts clean.But there are many more ways in which they come for your money (see box), like infecting your phone with forwards that transfer control, catching you by surprise with a video call and morphing the footage for blackmail, or ‘pig butchering’ you with texts about lucrative investment returns.The number of cases, and the swindled cash involved in those, has seen an exponential rise: 23 lakh cybercrime complaints were registered on the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal (NCRP) in 2024, a 42% jump over 2023.And the money lost to such frauds in 2024 was estimated to be Rs 23,000 crore, a 200% jump from Rs 7,500 crore in 2023. As a hydra-headed monster that takes new forms virtually every month, cybercrime is no longer a battle that state police can fight within their own limited jurisdictions and win. Which would explain why Supreme Court this month ordered CBI to launch a sweeping probe into all digital arrest scams.Bringing in the might of a central agency was an overdue move. As a senior cyber cell officer in Delhi pointed out, “the core challenge lies in the complex inter-state and geographical nexus of these operations, where the victim and the perpetrator are separated not just by distance but also by an intricate web of digital and financial layering.”Cybercrime presents a challenge entirely different from that posed by conventional crime. In a ‘digital arrest’ scam, which is perpetrated over a video call that can last hours, weeks, days, or even months, the money moves quickly through a series of what are known as ‘mule accounts’.These are usually located in places far apart and opened using forged documents or with the connivance of bankers. For example, money from a ‘digital arrest’ in Delhi, Gurgaon, Bengaluru or Hyderabad could be routed to mule accounts in West Bengal, Uttarakhand and Gujarat. That is why recoveries are only a fraction of the defrauded cash because, by the time the labyrinth of transactions has been decoded, the money has vanished.In India, two key hubs of cybercrime have been identified in Jharkhand’s Jamtara and the triangle of Bharatpur (Rajasthan), Mathura ( Uttar Pradesh ), and Nuh (Haryana). But an even more concerning dimension is the rise of large organised overseas operations in countries like Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and, of late, Myanmar.These are operations that run call-centre-style scam compounds, drawing their manpower from human trafficking victims, including Indians who are snared by local placement agents with the lure of foreign jobs in data entry, IT and management. “Once trapped, these recruits are held in prisonlike conditions and coerced into undertaking cybercrimes targeting their own countrymen,” said a Delhi Police officer.Several of these international operations have been traced to Chinese criminal syndicates that provide technical infrastructure like apps and VoIP. “CBI is uniquely positioned to connect these disparate dots: like a SIM card issued in one state, a bank account opened in another, and an IP address originating at a third location,” said a government official.The digital epidemic has fed on an explosive growth of the internet user base. While India has become an increasingly digital society, large sections of people remain digitally naïve because initiation to new technology and devices happened at a later stage in life. But cybercrime’s uncontrolled spiral has also exposed major vulnerabilities in two critical pillars — the telecom sector and the banking system. Both have failed to build adequate safeguards.“Fraudsters routinely exploit lax Know Your Customer (KYC) norms to illegally procure huge numbers of SIM cards. They are similarly also able to open mule bank accounts, the lifeblood of their operations,” said a Delhi cyber cell investigator. Systematic targeting of senior citizens with pension funds in their accounts and women makes it clear that scammers have access to banks’ customer data, investigators said.Recently, CBI arrested the manager of a prominent bank in Mumbai for allegedly accepting illegal gratification to process account-opening forms, creating channels for rapid layering of cybercrime proceeds. The accused is said to have facilitated the use of accounts that are linked to multiple cybercrime cases.Similar crackdowns across states, like ‘Operation Insider’ by Telangana Police, have led to the arrest of many bank officials for opening current accounts without due diligence in exchange for commissions from fraudsters.It’s the transnational cybercrime syndicates in Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar and Vietnam that execute the most complex frauds, increasingly deploying AI and deepfakes. These are the crimes that have so far proved the hardest to crack for police across Indian states. “Funds siphoned from Indian victims are quickly laundered, often converted into cryptocurrency and then moved internationally to accounts in countries like China, Singapore and Vietnam to evade detection,” explained a senior police officer.Sleuths may still have to play catch-up with new tactics, but the fight against cybercrime is much more organised now than it was two years back, which will help CBI.The Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C), through its Citizen Financial Cyber Fraud Reporting and Management System, has helped save around Rs 7,130 crore by facilitating rapid freezing of funds. NPCI (National Payments Corporation of India), too, has helped freeze scam proceeds in real time. A centralised toll-free helpline number, 1930, has been operationalised for quick assistance in lodging cybercrime complaints.Govt has blocked over 11 lakh SIMs and around 3 lakh IMEI numbers linked to frauds, underscoring the necessity of a coordinated, technological counteroffensive. Creation of a ‘Suspect Registry’ by I4C to flag suspect bank accounts and use of the ‘Pratibimb’ module to map criminal locations based on telecom and crime data are among other tech responses that have taken shape.“A state-of-the-art Cyber Fraud Mitigation Centre has been set up at I4C. It has brought together representatives of major banks, financial intermediaries, payment aggregators, telecom service providers, IT intermediaries and representatives of states/UTs and police to tackle cybercrime,” a government official said.By combining domestic reach and collaborations with security agencies globally, CBI can serve as the lead enforcer and nodal point for busting complex, transnational cybercrime networks. Through specialised initiatives like Operation Chakra, CBI has been coordinating simultaneous raids on financial nerve centres of cybercrime with organisations like FBI and Europol. This is something that no state police force can do.CBI can ensure that the digital trail of a crime — which might involve a victim in Delhi, a server in Europe, and a perpetrator in Southeast Asia — is traced and documented for prosecution. By utilising the Bharatpol portal and its Global Operations Centre, CBI can also create a bridge between state police forces and international intelligence, allowing real-time sharing of data. CBI’s strength also lies in its role as National Central Bureau for Interpol in India, which gives it a direct line to law enforcement in over 190 countries.The agency is also equipped to lead large-scale crackdowns on illegal call centres that have been operating as hubs for international extortion. Besides, it has extraterritorial mandate under Section 75 of the IT Act, which gives it legal authority to investigate any individual, regardless of nationality, whose digital actions impact systems within India.","The number of cases, and the swindled cash involved in those, has seen an exponential rise. 23 lakh cybercrime complaints were registered on the national cybercrime reporting portal (ncrp) in 2024. The money lost to such frauds in 2024 was estimated to be rs 23,000 crore, a 200% jump from rs 7,500 crore in 2023.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126211438,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-98250,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

CHANDRAPUR: The SIT probing illegal sale of a farmer's kidney in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, has uncovered a direct operational link to China. Fresh disclosures indicate that a Chinese surgeon, Dr Chiang, conducted transplant procedures in Cambodia and supplied harvested organs to clients in his home country.The revelations, based on statements of two key accus-ed during interrogation, have prompted officials to expand the scope of inquiry across international networks.Police sources said Ramakrishna Sunchu of Solapur (who also posed as 'Dr Krishna' and Mallesh) and Himanshu Bhardwaj from Mohali, Punjab, told interrogators Chiang performed the surgeries and ensured that all procured kidneys were routed to Chinese recipients.The kidney of Roshan Kule, a marginal farmer from Minthur village who was lured into selling his organ, was allegedly transplanted to a patient in China within 12 hours of the kidney removal, sources said.Investigators believe Chiang played a key role in recruiting intermediaries, allegedly enticing Sunchu and Bhardwaj with significant financial rewards to supply donors. Police are pursuing the third accused in the chain from West Bengal, who remains on the run.Himanshu Bhardwaj once ran a tour and travel business. His life took a turn when he fell in love with a young woman and began taking care of all her expenses.When she expressed her desire to travel to the US, Himanshu decided to fulfil her dream — even if it meant selling his own kidney.That decision made him enter the kidney trade.","Sit probing illegal sale of a farmer's kidney in chandrapur, maharashtra, has uncovered a direct operational link to china.

MUMBAI: After a routine trip to the market with his father to purchase vegetables on a winter morning in 2023 led to the death of a 30-year-old junior engineer with Konkan Railways, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal in Mumbai ordered Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) to pay approximately Rs 2.21 crore (inclusive of interest) to his bereaved family.The tragedy occurred on Dec 21, 2023, when Aniket Dabholkar, father to a one-year-old boy, was standing near his parked scooter while his father purchased vegetables. A speeding state-owned bus veered into the side margin of the road and struck Dabholkar, causing fatal head injuries.During the proceedings, MSRTC attempted to shift blame onto the deceased, suggesting he suddenly entered the path of the bus. However, the tribunal dismissed these claims, noting evidence and police reports clearly showed the scooter was stationary and the bus driver lost control. ""The fact that the driver of the offending bus drove the vehicle at a high speed and recklessly and caused the accident resulting in death of a person standing still by the side of the road indicates negligence,"" it said in the verdict.The family had moved the tribunal on January 20, 2024.""The claimants have duly proved negligence on the part of the accused driver,"" the tribunal said.In determining the compensation, it took into account Dabholkar's monthly salary of approximately Rs 84,000 and his promising career.It awarded Rs 1.95 crore as principal amount, which includes loss of dependency, funeral expenses, and ""consortium"" for emotional suffering of his 24-year-old widow, infant son, and elderly parents.It directed MSRTC to deposit the funds in 30 days, emphasising that the compensation must include 7% annual interest. Of the total award, it ordered Rs 95 lakh each be allocated to the wife and son, and the remainder shared between the parents.","Aniket dabholkar, a junior engineer with konkan railways, died in 2023.

‘Woman married 2nd time, not entitled to maintenance’

MUMBAI: In an unexpected turn, a woman’s current husband took the witness stand to depose on behalf of her ex-spouse, ending a nearly 17-year-old domestic violence case.The case, initiated in 2009 by the woman, alleged years of torture by her first husband. She sought protection and monetary relief, claiming she was ousted from her home. However, a Borivli court ruled that with her current husband confirming marriage, she was not entitled to maintenance.Additional chief judicial magistrate B N Chikne said, “As such, in such facts and circumstances and the evidence on record, it appears to me that it is proved from the evidence and documents produced on record, after divorce from the respondent No. 1 (ex-husband), the applicant (woman) performed a second marriage. Therefore, she is not entitled to get maintenance from respondent No. 1.”The judgment centred on the revelation that the woman had entered into a second marriage while her original maintenance claim was still active.In her plea, the woman said she married her ex-husband in 2005 through an arranged setup. She alleged that she later found out that the man was already married and his first wife began to frequent their home.Along with the ex-husband, his first wife would abuse her too. She alleged numerous incidents of physical, emotional and economic abuse. In Dec 2009, the first husband was directed to pay the woman an interim monthly maintenance of Rs 3,200 until the disposal of the case.While the woman’s sister served as a witness to support her allegations, the man brought to court an imam who officiated the woman’s second marriage, a handwriting and fingerprint expert who testified on the signatures and thumb impression on the nikahnama of the second marriage, and her husband.The trajectory of the trial shifted dramatically when her ex-husband produced her current husband as a defence witness to confirm their marital status. By confirming the second marriage through the evidence of the current husband himself, the defence nullified the woman’s status as a dependent of her former spouse.The court ruled the existence of this second union, confirmed by the man who entered into it, extinguished the woman's right to seek further maintenance or protection from her first husband.","The case, initiated in 2009 by the woman, alleged years of torture by her first husband.

JAIPUR: Over 1,230 mining leases, most of them disputed, continue to exist across Rajasthan's Aravali region. Together, these leases cover 17,393 hectares within the Aravali system.""At present, most leases in the Aravalis are under dispute and pending before courts. Some mines are closed, while others continue to operate,"" a senior mining official said.Incidentally, Rajasthan mining department was considering a proposal to lease out additional pits for excavation in the Aravalis but the Centre invoked a blanket ban on the grant of new mining leases in the mountain range following public outcry over a proposed ""new definition"" of one of the world's oldest mountain ranges.An official source said, ""The mining department issued notifications for 126 new leases in Nov 2025. Of these, 50 are located within Aravali districts, while 76 fall outside the Aravali region.""District-wise data highlights the scale of concentration, with Rajsamand district alone accounting for over 540 leases. Udaipur follows with 162 leases and Jaipur has 139. Alwar, Sirohi, and Bhilwara together account for over 250 leases, reflecting how deeply mining has penetrated the Aravali belt.Mining expert Pradeep Singh said the new ban does not cancel existing permissions retrospectively, allowing hundreds of leases to continue, particularly in Rajasthan. ""In many areas where leases are operational, environmental degradation is visible and, in several places, irreversible. Hills have been hollowed out, forest cover has thinned, and natural drainage systems have been disrupted,"" he said.Across Rajasthan, the mining footprint extends far beyond the Aravalis. The state has 16,116 mining leases, of which around 10,060 are operational, along with nearly 18,000 quarry licences.Mining expert Kishore Kumawat said area-wise data within the Aravali region shows Udaipur accounting for 6,084 hectares under mining, followed by Sojat with 2,575.4 hectares, Bhilwara with 1,229 hectares, and Rajsamand with nearly 800 hectares.","Over 1,230 mining leases, most of them disputed, continue to exist across rajasthan's aravali region.

BENGALURU: What began as a tattoo of ""another woman"" on the husband's forearm ended in the murder of his wife and a sentence of life imprisonment for him.Earlier this week, a city court convicted 33-year-old Vinay Kumar, a resident of A Narayanapura in Mahadevapura, of killing his wife Ashwini D, 29, inside their home in April 2021. Since his arrest, Kumar had remained lodged in Bengaluru Central Prison at Parappana Agrahara, with his attempt to secure bail failing.Kumar and Ashwini, an engineer and his younger sister's classmate, met at a family wedding, fell in love, and married in 2018. But the marriage began to unravel three years later when Kumar returned home with a tattoo reading ""Roopa"" inked on his right forearm. When Ashwini questioned him about the tattoo and demanded to know who Roopa was, Kumar gave evasive answers. She later discovered that he was having an affair.According to the prosecution, Kumar feared she might take legal or personal action against him. Unwilling to end the relationship with Roopa, he decided to eliminate his wife.Public prosecutor Satyavati HR told TOI the murder was planned carefully. On the night of April 16, 2021, Kumar purchased a can of beer and a strip of 10 sleeping tablets before returning home.After having chicken biryani for dinner, he forced Ashwini to drink the beer, secretly mixed with the tablets. She soon slipped into a deep sleep. Kumar believed the overdose would be fatal. When he found Ashwini still breathing early the next morning, Kumar strangled her using her dupatta.""Afterwards, he stepped out of the house and raised the alarm, claiming his wife was lying motionless,"" Satyavati said. With a neighbour's help, he took Ashwini to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared her brought dead. Kumar initially managed to convince Ashwini's parents and relatives that it was a natural death. However, Mahadevapura police ordered an autopsy, while viscera samples were sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory.The autopsy revealed the death was due to strangulation, leading to Kumar's arrest. Subsequent FSL reports confirmed the presence of alcohol and sleeping tablets in Ashwini's system.During the trial, circumstantial evidence sealed Kumar's fate. Testimonies from a wine shop cashier and a medical store assistant, backed by CCTV footage, established that Kumar had purchased the beer and sleeping tablets on the night of the murder.After police filed the charge-sheet, Kumar filed his bail application. Police, however, discovered that the surety documents submitted were fake and informed the court that his family had distanced themselves from him after the crime. The bail plea was rejected, forcing him to spend time in prison.","Vinay kumar, 33, convicted of killing his wife ashwini d, 29, inside their home in april 2021.

'Tragic that patriotic people of northeast are referred to as Chinese and attacked'

DEHRADUN: A 24-year-old MBA student from Tripura, who confronted a group of men hurling racial slurs at him and his younger brother, died in a Dehradun hospital on Friday after fighting for his life for over 14 days. The stabbing happened on Dec 9, minutes after Anjel Chakma said, ""We are not Chinese... We are Indians. What certificate should we show to prove that?"" The six men allegedly responded with brutal violence.What began as a regular grocery run to the local market in the Selaqui area of Uttarakhand's capital city turned into a fatal confrontation that evening.Anjel and his brother Michael, both students in Dehradun for over a year, were stopped and taunted by a group of men who allegedly referred to them in derogatory terms. When Anjel calmly stood his ground, the situation turned uglier.Michael would later tell police and friends how his brother calmly but firmly corrected them. That assertion, of identity and dignity, was met with knives. ""Soon after Anjel replied, they attacked him and his brother while hurling abuses,"" said a friend of Anjel's, who remained at the hospital through the two weeks that followed.""Anjel suffered serious injuries to his neck and spine. Michael is also injured and still in a serious condition. ""The friend requested anonymity, but his voice carried anger and disbelief. ""He was one of the calmest, friendliest people. We're all broken by what happened."" Anjel's body was flown to Agartala on Saturday, as Tripura erupted in anger. His family was assisted by Pradyot Bikram Manikya Debbarma, chairman of Tipra Motha Party and a member of the erstwhile Tripura royal family, who had been in touch with the family since the day of the incident and had supported his medical treatment.Speaking to TOI, Debbarma said on Saturday, ""It's tragic that the patriotic people of the northeast are called Chinese and attacked. Those who hurl racist slurs forget that it is because of the brave people of the northeast that China cannot enter the country. These incidents don't just hurt families. They divide our people. And when we are divided, we are vulnerable. We don't want that. We want justice.""Suraj Debbarma, state president of Youth Tipra Federation, the youth wing of Tipra Motha, who helped coordinate Anjel's last rites, said: ""People from the northeast face racial slurs and xenophobic attacks in the north regularly.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has taken suo motu cognisance of concerns linked to the definition of the Aravali Range, signalling fresh judicial scrutiny of an issue that has sparked protests and debate over mining and environmental protection.According to news agency ANI, a three-judge vacation bench headed by Chief Justice of India Surya Kant will hear the matter on Monday.The court’s decision comes amid widespread concern over how the Aravali hills are being defined for regulatory purposes, particularly in relation to mining activities.The definition accepted earlier by the apex court has triggered objections from environmentalists and civil society groups, who fear it could weaken conservation safeguards for one of India’s oldest mountain systems.The Union environment ministry has moved to address some of these concerns by deciding to further expand areas where mining will be prohibited across the Aravali range.The ministry has directed the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) to identify additional landforms and zones where mining should be banned, beyond areas already under restriction.Currently, only about 0.2 per cent of the Aravali’s total area of around 1.4 lakh sq km is eligible for mining, and the new exercise could reduce this further.The ministry has said this step would “further enlarge the coverage of areas protected and prohibited from mining in the entire Aravalis, keeping in mind the local topography, ecology and biodiversity”.States spanning the Aravali range, including Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat, have also been told not to grant any new mining leases until a comprehensive Management Plan for Sustainable Mining (MPSM) is finalised.The controversy centres on a 100-metre height-based definition of Aravali hills adopted by the Supreme Court on November 20 for mining-related decisions.Under this definition, a hill is identified as a landform rising 100 metres or more from the lowest enclosing contour, with nearby hills within 500 metres grouped as a range.Environmentalists argue this approach could significantly shrink the area officially recognised as Aravali hills, as much of the range is low-lying.Despite the criticism, the environment ministry has maintained that the new definition does not dilute mining controls and that existing safeguards remain in place. It has also clarified that for mines already in operation, state governments must ensure strict compliance with environmental norms and Supreme Court directions.",The supreme court has taken suo motu cognisance of concerns linked to the definition of the aravali range.

Congress Rift Out In Open? Digvijaya Singh's Modi-RSS Praise Draws Jibes From BJP Amid CWC Meet

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Saturday created a stir by praising the organisational strength of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh -- a group the Congress has long opposed ideologically. Sharing a black-and-white photograph from a social media platform that showed Narendra Modi seated on the ground while BJP veteran Lal Krishna Advani sat on a chair in the background, Singh acknowledged how the RSS shapes leadership within the organisation.He pointed to the image as an example of how a grassroots worker from the RSS and Jan Sangh rose to become prime minister of the country.Posting the picture on X, the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister wrote, ""I found this image on the Quora site. It’s very impressive. How an RSS grassroots swayamsevak and Jan Sangh @BJP4India worker sat on the floor at the feet of leaders and became the state’s Chief Minister and the country’s Prime Minister. This is the power of the organisation.""But later in the day, he issued a clarification, saying, ""I support the organisation. I am against the RSS and Modi ji... You have misunderstood... I have praised 'sangathan'. I was, am, and will remain a staunch opponent of the RSS and Modi... Is it a bad thing to strengthen and praise the organisation?...""BJP leader Gaurav Vallabh, once a staunch Congress member, weighed in on Digvijaya Singh's remarks and used the moment to criticise the grand old party.Speaking to news agency ANI, he said Singh’s comments confirm that it is a ""family-owned company"".Also read: BJP attacks Gandhi-Vadra family over Kharge's treatment in presser; shares Jairam clip Vallabh said, ""Digvijay Singh is saying that the Congress party has today become a 'family-owned company' where only the person born into that family can make all the decisions...

SRINAGAR: A day after Mirwaiz Umar Farooq justified the removal of the “Chairman, All Parties Hurriyat Conference” designation from his X account as a “Hobson’s choice,” People’s Conference chairman and MLA Sajad Lone on Saturday urged people to question the Kashmir chief cleric’s “surrender in lieu of protocol and CRPF security. ”“I visited my constituency, where villagers told me that a young man was arrested for sharing a Facebook post and released after two years, while another was picked up 15 days ago merely for liking a post,” Lone said, adding that in contrast, Mirwaiz modified his X bio to receive “five-star treatment”.Accusing the Kashmiri separatist of double standards, Lone recalled how Hurriyat brass vilified him as an “agency man” after he entered mainstream politics decades ago.“There was intense militancy at the time, and how I am alive today is known only to God,” Lone said. While asserting that he does not seek public vindication, he added, “He (Mirwaiz) should apologise for what was done to me in the past. That is the least he can do.”After removing the Hurriyat chairman designation from X on Thursday, Mirwaiz said on Friday, “I was being pressured by the authorities to make changes to my X handle as Hurriyat chairman, as all constituents of the Hurriyat Conference, including the Awami Action Committee that I head, have been banned under the UAPA.”“At a time when public space and avenues of communication stand severely restricted, this platform remains among the very few means available to me to reach out to my people... Under such circumstances, it is a Hobson’s choice I was left to make,” Mirwaiz said.PDP and National Conference have backed Mirwaiz, calling the removal of bio as a personal choice and condemning the authorities for harassing Mirwaiz.Commenting on the Dec 23 HC judgment dismissing former CM Mehbooba Mufti ’s plea seeking the transfer of Kashmiri political prisoners from jails outside J&K to prisons within the UT, Lone said, “I am convinced Madam (Mehbooba Mufti) is doing drama.”The People’s Conference chief also criticised the growing incidents of harassment of Kashmiris in different parts of the country. “It is eroding the very foundations of national integration and must be treated as a matter of national security...

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Saturday targeted the Gandhi–Vadra family, alleging that ""their hate for Dalit is so open."" The charge from the saffron party came shortly after the Congress held a press conference in which party president Mallikarjun Kharge initially said he would not read the full note aloud and would instead circulate it to the media, before being interrupted moments later by the party's general secretary, who urged him to read it out.Sharing a clip of the exchange, BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari accused the Congress leadership of disrespecting Kharge. He wrote on X, ""Be it Rahul Gandhi Priyanka Gandhi or Jairam Ramesh, their hate for a 'DALIT' is so open!

This is how Gandhi - Vadra family treats their own President!""At the press conference, the Congress announced a nationwide protest against the Centre's decision to replace the rural employment scheme MGNREGA with what it called the VB G Ram G Act.Following the Congress Working Committee meeting, Kharge said replacing a scheme named after Mahatma Gandhi amounted to an insult to the Father of the Nation.Meanwhile, leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the decision to scrap MGNREGA without consulting relevant ministers or even the Union Cabinet.The LoP also pledged to oppose the move, saying, ""As Kharge ji has said, we are going to resist it.

JAMMU: A large number of protesters on Saturday gathered outside Lok Bhavan in Jammu, demanding revocation of the MBBS admission list of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence (SMVDIME) in Reasi district.The protesters were mostly activists of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Sangharsh Samiti, who are up in arms against 42 of the total 50 seats going to Muslim candidates.Waving flags and holding banners, around 250-300 activists shouted slogans against Jammu and Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha, who is the chairperson of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board as well as SMVDIME, as they struggled to make their way into the Lok Bhavan. A strong police contingent foiled their bid.Later, the protesters were joined by J&K BJP’s women members and several trade leaders, including president of Jammu Chamber of Commerce and Industries Arun Gupta.Talking to media persons, convener of the Sangarsh Samiti, Colonel Sukhvir Singh Mankotia, said the protest would continue “till the resolution of our genuine demands which are related to our faith”.“We are not against students of any particular religion. We just want the seats in the medical college to be reserved for Hindu students alone,” he said, adding that the selected Muslim students be transferred to other colleges.The controversy erupted after seats for the inaugural MBBS batch of 50 students were filled through the NEET merit list last month. While 42 Muslim candidates, mostly from Kashmir, were selected for admission, only seven Hindu students from Jammu and one Sikh made it to the list.Meanwhile, Shiv Sena (UBT) has demanded a resolution of the dispute, saying it was possible through the joint efforts of the Centre and Omar Abdullah govt.The party’s J&K unit chief Manish Sahni, in a veiled attack on BJP, said, “Those who are fanning the flames of agitation from behind the scenes are largely responsible for the dispute. Even when Articles 370 and 35A were abrogated in J&K in 2019, no interest was shown in amending the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University Act to prioritise Hindus.”He also demanded that Hindus should be granted minority status in J&K.",Protests outside jammu lok bhavan against mbbs admission list of shri mata vaishno devi institute of medical excellence.
