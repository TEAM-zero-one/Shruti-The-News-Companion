NEW DELHI: Observing that issuing summons to any person by a court on the basis of a frivolous or vexatious complaint is very serious as it tarnishes the image of the person, Supreme Court has said that in such cases HCs should intervene to protect the person by quashing the case as it would do not only justice to the accused but would save precious court time.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and Sandeep Mehta laid down four steps to be considered by HCs to come to the conclusion for quashing a criminal case. It said step one is to find out whether the material relied upon by the accused is sound, reasonable, and indubitable, step two is whether the material relied upon by the accused is sufficient to reject assertions contained in the complaint, step three is whether the material relied upon by the accused has not been refuted by the prosecution/complainant or it cannot be justifiably refuted by the prosecution/complainant and step four is, whether proceeding with the trial would result in an abuse of process of the court, and would not serve the ends of justice.""If the answer to all the steps is in the affirmative, the judicial conscience of the high court should persuade it to quash such criminal - proceedings, in exercise of power vested in it under Section 482 of the CrPC. Such exercise of power, besides doing justice to the accused, would save precious court time, which would otherwise be wasted in holding such a trial (as well as, proceedings arising therefrom) specially when, it is clear that the same would not conclude in the conviction of the accused,"" the bench said.Applying the above test, the bench quashed a rape case against a man after noting that there was four years delay in filing complaint and the complainant also refused to accept notice from the apex court to contest the case. ""It is very apparent on a plain reading of the complaint, more particularly, considering the nature of the allegations that the same doesn't inspire any confidence. There is no good explanation offered, why it took four years for the respondent no.2 to file a complaint,"" the bench said.It said not only the appellant was dragged into the criminal proceedings but even the parents of the appellant were arrayed as accused and various other offences have been alleged. ""This itself makes the entire case doubtful. None of the allegations levelled in the complaint are substantiated by any other independent evidence on record,"" the bench said.","Supreme court says hcs should intervene to protect the person by quashing the case. A bench of justices j b pardiwala and sandeep mehta laid down four steps to be considered by hcs. It said step one is to find out whether the material relied upon by the accused is sound, reasonable and indubitable.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123798266,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-952615,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Credit WWF-India)

NEW DELHI: A wildlife survey conducted in Arunachal Pradesh has brought out first-ever photographic evidence of the elusive Pallas’s cat in the state, reaffirming the eastern Himalayan terrain as a global biodiversity hotspot.The survey, conducted by WWF-India in association with the forest department of the Arunachal Pradesh government, also recorded the presence of other wild cats - snow leopard, common leopard, clouded leopard and marbled cat - above 4200 metres, indicating the landscape’s unique wild cat diversity.“The discovery of Pallas’s cat in Arunachal Pradesh at nearly 5,000 metres is a powerful reminder of how little we still know about life in the high Himalayas,” said Rishi Kumar Sharma, head-science and conservation, Himalayas programme, WWF-India.Pallas’s cat is one of the most elusive and rarely photographed wild cats, and remains one of the least studied feline species. Its documentation in Arunachal Pradesh extends the known distribution of the species in the eastern Himalaya, adding to earlier confirmed records from Sikkim, Bhutan, and eastern Nepal.Though WWF-India conducted the survey during July-Sept last year, its findings were released only recently.The organisation claimed to have deployed 136 camera traps in 83 locations across 2,000 sq km of rugged high-altitude rangelands in West Kameng and Tawang districts, making it one of the most extensive wildlife monitoring exercises.Besides getting photographic record of Pallas’s cat, the survey documented the highest elevation records for common leopard at 4,600 metres above sea level (masl), clouded leopard at 4,650 masl, marbled cat at 4,326 masl, Himalayan wood owl at 4,194 masl and grey-headed flying squirrel at 4,506 masl.WWF-India’s findings noted that the elevation records for these species were the “highest in India to dateand may exceed previously known global elevation limits”.“The discovery of Pallas’s cat in Arunachal Pradesh is a milestone for wildlife research in the eastern Himalayas. These findings reaffirm the state’s importance as a global biodiversity hotspot and highlight the need for continued investment in scientific monitoring and conservation,” said Ngilyang Tam, state’s principal chief conservator of forests and chief wildlife warden (wildlife and biodiversity).",First-ever photographic evidence of the elusive pallas’s cat in arunachal pradesh.

Omar Abdullah seeks long-term solution as NH closure worries Kashmiri fruit growers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/omar-abdullah-seeks-long-term-solution-as-nh-closure-worries-kashmiri-fruit-growers/articleshow/123794512.cms,"SRINAGAR/JAMMU: The Srinagar-Jammu highway (NH-44) has remained shut for traffic for the past 15 days due to landslides at several stretches, leaving Kashmiri fruit growers worried about their produce rotting in view of the prolonged closure.CM Omar Abdullah Tuesday assured them that restoration work on NH-44 was being monitored hourly and all possible measures were being adopted to restore highway connectivity. He also said long-term solutions — such as introducing a rail cargo service for Kashmir’s fruit produce — are being explored to prevent future disruptions during peak seasons.J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha visited Thard village in Udhampur district on Tuesday and reviewed the ongoing restoration work along NH-44. He also assured assistance to flood-hit residents of Jammu city.Senior officials, meanwhile, said NH-44 is likely to be opened on Wednesday for light vehicles. “The highway is still closed from Jakheni (Udhampur) towards Srinagar and vice versa due to blockages between Jakheni and Balli Nallah. No vehicular movement shall be allowed from Nagrota (Jammu) towards Reasi, Chenani, Patnitop, Doda, Ramban, Banihal, Srinagar, and vice versa,” a traffic official said.Jammu and Kashmir Apple Farmers Federation has warned that prolonged highway closure could push the horticulture sector — which generates around Rs 10,000 crore income and employs around 35 lakh people — to the brink of crisis. “Whenever Srinagar-Jammu highway is opened, only fruit trucks should be allowed to ply at night,” said Federation president Zahoor Ahmad Rather. He said several trucks stranded on the road had to return from Qazigund and unload apple boxes, leading to enormous losses.Border Roads Organisation’s 118 Road Construction Company, meanwhile, managed to restore the critical Gulabgarh-Chasoti road, which was reopened for traffic Tuesday. Twin cloudbursts in Kishtwar’s Chasoti on Aug 14 had triggered flash floods, killing 65 people and leaving several missing. Heavy downpour following the disaster had further damaged crucial road links in the area.""The vital link was severed following catastrophic torrential rains and subsequent landslides on Aug 26 and 27, cutting off numerous remote villages in Jammu division,” Army’s Jammu-based PRO Lt Col Suneel Bartwal said.“Working in treacherous and unforgiving conditions, the BRO Karmyogis under the command of Maj Jivitesh Razora, worked round-the-clock for 13 days, battling unstable hillsides and debris, and finally succeeded in clearing a formidable 14km stretch,” Bartwal said.“The operation was an example of inter-agency coordination. While 118 RCC tackled the more extensive damage from Chasoti, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana initiated clearance from Gulabgarh end, opening a 7km stretch. The combined effort of both agencies ensured that the entire 21km blocked route was made motorable in record time,” Bartwal added.",The srinagar-jammu highway (nh-44) has remained shut for traffic for the past 15 days due to landslides at several stretches.

ED Raids Aap Leader Saurabh Bhardwaj In Alleged Hospital Construction Scam Across Delhi-NCRatishi

Aam Aadmi Party Delhi president Saurabh Bharadwaj has asked the Bharatiya Janta Party to clarify the position of Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta's husband, alleging that he frequently attends government meetings.The AAP leader added that it was the chief minister, Rekha Gupta, and not her husband who had taken the oath of the Constitution. ""Delhi CM Rekha Gupta has taken the oath of the Constitution... No country's law allows her husband to be included in government meetings. But we have seen that her husband is attending meetings with them, conducting inspections, giving instructions to officers..."" Bharadwaj said.Stating that CM's husband is a businessman the AAP leader asked ""How can he run the government or have a stake in running the government? This is completely unethical and unconstitutional. .. My question to the BJP. They should say what position Rekha Gupta's husband holds?""Earlier in the day, Bharadwaj in a post on X termed Rekha Gupta's husband at official government meetings as ""completely unconstitutional"".In his X post, Bharadwaj compared the situation to that portrayed in the popular web series ""Panchayat"" which portrays the functioning of a Gram Panchayat in the fictional village of Phulera.""DelhiGovernment Becomes Phulera Panchayat. Just as in Phulera's panchayat, where the woman sarpanch's husband acted as the sarpanch, today in Delhi, the CM's husband is sitting in official meetings.We had previously mentioned that the CM's husband attends official meetings, conducts meetings with officials, and carries out inspections,"" Bharadwaj said in X post.""This is completely unconstitutional. In the nation's capital, democracy and the constitutional system are being mocked in this manner,"" he said.Bharadwaj further questioned whether the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which often criticises Congress for dynastic politics, would justify such a move.""The BJP, which relentlessly criticises Congress for dynastic politics, should explain--is this not dynastic politics?"" he asked.Bharadwaj raised several other questions: ""Does the CM of the world's largest party have no worker left whom she can trust? What is that work which only a family member can do? What are the reasons that the CM wants to establish her husband's authority? Why is her husband being made a part of the government administrative system in this way?""He also said that photos of the meeting were posted on both the official Instagram handle of the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) and CM Rekha Gupta's Instagram.","Aam aadmi party delhi president saurabh bharadwaj has asked the bharatiya janta party to clarify the position of delhi chief minister rekha gupta's husband.

They should also affirm that they are not members of any other registered political party.EC sources on Tuesday said some recent cases of applicants, who had submitted manipulated and/or false affidavits in an attempt to secure registration under Section 29A, had come to its notice.The intensive scrutiny of randomly picked 20 affidavits submitted by the applicant parties - by the state/UT chief electoral officers (CEO) concerned through the district election officers (DEOs) - is aimed at detecting such false affidavits, which will serve as an adverse input while deciding on their registration.As part of its efforts to clean up the political space and weed out non-existent or inactive RUPPs that tend to misuse tax exemptions and serve as money laundering vehicles, EC had in Aug delisted 334 RUPPs, bringing down their total strength to 2,520 from 2,854.

However, the poll panel made it clear that Aadhaar shall be accepted and utilised only as proof of identity and not as proof of citizenship.The EC's instructions, conveyed in a letter to the Bihar chief electoral officer, are in pursuance of Supreme Court's directions issued Monday.While asking for Aadhaar card to be treated as the 12th document accepted with the signed declaration to be attached with the SIR enumeration form, EC cited section 9 of Aadhaar (Delivery of Financial And Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 that states ""Aadhaar number or the authentication thereof, shall not, by itself, confer any right of, or be proof of citizenship or domicile in respect of Aadhaar number holder"".This means that though Aadhaar number, once authenticated, can be taken as proof of identity, the applicant will still need to submit one of the 11 listed documents, or an alternative document since the list is only indicative and not exhaustive, to establish Indian citizenship, a key criteria laid down by Article 326 of the Constitution for enrolment as an elector.EC Tuesday said section 23(4) of Representation of People Act, 1950, already enumerates Aadhaar as one of the documents for the purpose of establishing a person's identity.Even the enumeration form under SIR has an Aadhaar field; it comes pre-filled for electors included in the 2003 roll and have shared their Aadhaar, or must be filled by applicant on a voluntary basis.The commission Tuesday directed the Bihar CEO to bring its directive on Aadhaar, to the knowledge of all district election officers, electoral registration officers, assistant EROs and other authorities for ""strict implemention"".

Kerala says governor must play collaborative role,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kerala-says-governor-must-play-collaborative-role/articleshow/123797868.cms,"1

NEW DELHI: Kerala govt on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that governors must play a collaborative role with state govts on bills passed by legislatures, and said they must follow the nuanced yet non-confrontationist approach of Arif Mohd Khan - the present governor of Bihar who was Kerala governor from Sept 2019 to Jan 2025.For the Pinarayi Vijayan-headed Kerala govt, nonagenarian and acclaimed senior advocate K K Venugopal remembered the amiable tenure of Khan, and said, ""The practice followed in Kerala has been that the governor sends for the minister concerned, who had moved the bill in the assembly, to discuss with him his concerns about the contents of the bill.""""After discussion with the minister, the governor, if satisfied, would grant assent, but in the alternative may decide to send the bill back to the legislature with suggestions for amendment. If, on the other hand, there is no agreement on either of these two counts, the governor would indicate that he intends to withhold assent."" Venugopal asked why of the 28 states and three UTs with legislatures, only five states are repeatedly coming to SC being aggrieved by the governor's attempt to stall bills by sitting on them indefinitely. That is because governors in all other states have adopted a collaborative approach towards law-making power of the govt through the legislature, he said.Venugopal said, ""This approach would be most appropriate as the governor being a part of the legislature and head of a state would collaborate and ensure that bills passed by the legislature are implemented, straight away, in the best interests of the people of a state."" He warned that fastening of timelines on governors and the President would tempt states, which used to resolve differences of opinion with governors on bills, to approach the court the moment assent is even slightly delayed.Supplementing Venugopal's arguments on collaborative effort but adding to it the ornamental character of the posts of governor and President, Punjab through senior advocate Arvind Datar said the role of governors and the President is that they have the right to be consulted, right to encourage and a right to warn. They may warn the govt about the unconstitutionality of a bill and may return it to legislature for reconsideration, but once it is approved for the second time by the assembly, a governor would have no option but to grant assent, Datar said.",Kerala govt told the supreme court that governors must play a collaborative role with state govts on bills passed by legislatures.

This declaration from Imphal Hmar Displaced People Committee captures the defiance of Kuki-Zo groups who said they will boycott events tied to PM Narendra Modi's likely Sept 13 visit to Manipur.Preparations are underway in Imphal and Churachandpur, though PMO is yet to confirm his itinerary. Displaced people's associations, including Eastern Vaiphei IDPs Welfare Committee & Chandel District IDP Welfare Committee, echoed Hmar committee's stand, signalling that Modi's arrival will 'meet a wall of grief' rather than celebration.Ethnic violence that broke out in May 2023 has killed more than 260 people, displaced over 60,000 and burned hundreds of villages, hardening divides between Kuki-Zo tribes in the hills and Meiteis in Imphal valley. Relief camps still house thousands.Apex tribal union Kuki Inpi Manipur (KIM) said Modi ""should be welcomed upon his visit"" but stressed it must become a platform ""to press for justice and recognition of Kuki-Zo people's collective aspirations"". Its demand: a political solution addressing root causes of the conflict. ""Temporary relief measures cannot substitute for a lasting settlement,"" KIM said.The group also hit back at the Sept 4 suspension of operations (SoO) extension signed by two Kuki armed groups, Centre and state, which included a clause affirming Manipur's territorial integrity.KIM said the deal applies only to those armed groups, not the wider Kuki-Zo community. ""Separation from Meiteis has been a lived reality since May 3, 2023,"" it said, adding SoO groups had already told MHA the chapter on ""Manipur integrity"" was closed. ""Kuki-Zo people do not recognise or uphold the idea of Manipur territorial integrity in any form,"" KIM said.Secrecy over PM's itinerary has sharpened tensions. Naga groups have launched a trade embargo, Meitei organisations are pushing back against peace overtures, and Manipur remains under President's rule since Feb. Observers said Modi's visit, if it goes ahead, will happen in a landscape of ethnic fragmentation and competing demands for autonomy. His engagement - who he meets, what he announces, and whether he acknowledges the fractured realities - could potentially set the course of peace and governance for years.","Kuki-zo groups say they will boycott events tied to pm narendra modi's likely sept 13 visit to manipur.

MUMBAI: In the case of a major security breach at Navy Nagar - the Navy's residential area in Mumbai's Colaba - where a man impersonating a naval personnel fled with a rifle and ammunition after taking it from a junior sailor, the role of an accomplice who collected the rifle from the impersonator after it was thrown over the compound wall has emerged. Further, the intruder spent three hours inside the complex before fleeing, police said.A board of inquiry has been initiated against the junior sailor to determine if he followed SOPs for entering weapon details during duty sign-off and executing handover procedures to the man who posed as his 'reliever' in naval uniform.CCTV footage captured an alleged imposter wearing a mask to conceal his identity and dressed in civilian attire throwing the stolen INSAS rifle and 40 bullets over the compound wall at a spot inside Navy Nagar at around 8pm Saturday. The accomplice collected it before the suspect fled.Cuffe Parade police, who registered a case of theft, will add more stringent sections once there is more clarity on the offence. It is suspected the suspect conducted reconnaissance before carrying out the act.The incident occurred between 4.30pm and 8pm Saturday. ""A probe is on to find out if there is any insider role. The suspect captured on CCTV had masked his face and changed into civilian attire soon after the 20-year-old junior sailor left for his quarters.The suspect covered his face before heading towards the wall and threw the weapon over the compound wall. CCTV cameras captured it all,"" said a cop from Cuffe Parade police station.Officials said the way the intruder was dressed, the timing of guard change, and confidence with which he walked into the defence area and convinced the sailor he had come as his reliever strongly points to the suspect being someone who knows the system inside out.The intruder approached the sailor, claiming to be his senior officer from Quick Response Team (QRT), and said there was an orange alert and hence he had come to check on him. After checking the sailor's identity and other details, the intruder asked him to leave as he was his 'reliever'. The sailor handed over his rifle and magazine and left for his hostel, only to reappear an hour later to realise the man was missing.Six teams from zone-1 of Mumbai police, along with other agencies, are searching for the accused. With the help of the junior sailor, police have created a sketch of the suspect.""CCTV captured the imposter entering through the main gate with a laptop bag in which he is suspected to have carried the Navy uniform. He used some ID cards to gain access. After staying inside for almost three hours, the imposter approached the junior sailor and took his INSAS rifle and 40 bullets. He calmly entered Navy Nagar through the main gate and left without getting caught,"" said the officer.A source in the know of the matter said the junior sailor, was among the Agniveer recruits who, after completing basic training at Odisha's INS Chilka, were assigned to Navy Nagar a few months ago.Navy officials are also working on tightening security measures. In a press statement on Tuesday, the Navy said loss of a rifle along with ammunition from a sentry post was reported.",A man impersonating a naval personnel fled with a rifle and ammunition after taking it from a junior sailor.

They have also been asked to add or include new eligible beneficiaries so that deserving people get govt aid.Sources said such a move will ensure lakhs of “deserving” people waiting for inclusion in the list get the benefit. For example, while around 10 lakh new beneficiaries can be added to the list in Delhi, in Maharashtra over 50,000 can be included.Some of the state food secretaries who attended a meeting convened by the food ministry said that they have been urged to expedite the process for ‘correct targeting’ of beneficiaries. “As per the norm, state govts are empowered to create their own criteria for inclusion and exclusion of beneficiaries under the food security scheme. The food ministry has just asked us to follow our own criteria and if any state wants to change the norm, they can do so,” said a state govt official who attended the recent meeting.Earlier an exercise by the food ministry had found that about 10% of the existing 80 crore beneficiaries under PM Garib Kalyan Ann Yojna were found to appear in one or more databases such as taxpayers, car owners or company directors. This also included beneficiaries who have not lifted free foodgrain for more than six months and they have been put under the “silent ration cards” category.Sources said states including Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh had initiated steps to weed out ineligible beneficiaries even before the Centre shared the indicative list.","Food ministry has urged states to complete the weeding out of ineligible beneficiaries for the govt’s free foodgrain scheme.

"Assam Cabinet approves SOP to detect, deport 'illegals' in 10 days",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assam-cabinet-approves-sop-to-detect-deport-illegals-in-10-days/articleshow/123797628.cms,"GUWAHATI: Assam Cabinet approved on Tuesday a new standard operating procedure empowering district commissioners and senior superintendents of police to identify and expel illegal immigrants within 10 days, sidestepping the long route through the Foreigners' Tribunals.Illegal immigrants detected within 12 hours of crossing into Assam, or found near zero line along the border, will be pushed back immediately, the SOP mandates. If proof of Indian citizenship is not furnished within 10 days, the DC must issue an expulsion order, giving the person 24 hours to exit through a designated route.CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said the overhaul was necessary to unclog Assam's burdened tribunal system. ""The current route through Foreigners' Tribunals till conclusion is a long one, which may stretch to the HC and SC. There are 82,000 pending cases in our tribunals. This Cabinet decision bypasses the tribunal system for the first time,"" he said.The move marks a sweeping shift in how Assam tackles illegal immigration, particularly from Bangladesh. Bangladeshi Muslims have long been at the heart of the state's demographic anxieties and were central to the anti-foreigner agitation of the 1980s, a movement that reshaped the state's politics and culminated in the Assam Accord of 1985.The new framework draws authority from the Immigrants (Expulsion from Assam) Act, 1950, a law enacted specifically for the state but largely overshadowed by later Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act.IM(DT) Act was enforced only in Assam from Oct 15, 1983. Other states continued under the Foreigners Act, 1946. Supreme Court struck it down as ultra vires in 2005 after a petition filed by then students' leader and current Union minister Sarbananda Sonowal.SC called it discriminatory and violative of Art 14 on equality and Art 355, which obliges Centre to shield states from external aggression and disturbance. The law made detection and deportation of illegal immigrants cumbersome with stiff procedural barriers. Unlike Foreigners Act, where suspects must prove citizenship, IM(DT) shifted the burden onto state, weakening enforcement.Post-IMDT, Assam defaulted to tribunals until a constitutional bench last Oct ruled the 1950 Act ""shall be effectively employed for the purpose of identification of illegal immigrants"". The 1950 Act empowers Union govt to order the removal of any person or class of people entering Assam from outside India, if their stay is deemed detrimental to public interest or to the rights of scheduled tribes in the state.The SOP says only when officials cannot make a prima facie call will a suspected immigrant's case be sent to a tribunal. People already declared foreign nationals by tribunals, having exhausted all appeals, will face immediate expulsion without further verification.Under the new system, once a suspect is flagged, SSP must capture biometric and demographic data on Foreigners Identification Portal. If an expulsion order is ignored, the person will be placed in a holding centre or handed to BSF.","Assam cabinet approves new standard operating procedure to identify and expel illegal immigrants within 10 days.
