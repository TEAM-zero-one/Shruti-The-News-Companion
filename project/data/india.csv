Dictatorial mentality led to Emergency: Amit Shah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dictatorial-mentality-led-to-emergency-amit-shah/articleshow/122059728.cms,"NEW DELHI: On the eve of the 50th anniversary of imposition of Emergency by Indira Gandhi in 1975, home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday said it was an attempt to turn a multi-party democracy into a dictatorship as he hit out at DMK, socialists and others who have joined hands with Congress, saying they were sitting with a party that had ""murdered democracy"".Shah justified the Modi govt's decision to commemorate the day as 'Samvidhan Hatya Diwas', saying the people should remember how the country suffers terrible consequences when a govt becomes dictatorial.""Emergency was not a product of circumstances and compulsion but of dictatorial mentality and hunger for power. It was the beginning of the conspiracy to convert multi-party democracy into one-party dictatorship. It was the 'anyaaykaal' of the then governing party,"" Shah said, addressing an event, '50 Years Since Emergency'.He said June 25 - the day Emergency was imposed - reminded everyone how far Congress could go for power. ""It's difficult to define Emergency in one sentence, but I've tried; it was a conspiracy to turn a multi-party democracy into a dictatorship,"" he added.Shah said after imposition of Emergency, 1.1 lakh people - opposition members, student activists, journalists and editors - were arrested across the country.Non-Congress govts in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu were dismissed by Indira Gandhi, he added.""Unfortunately, many of those who faced the wrath of Emergency are now aligned with Congress. I want to ask these parties - DMK, Samajwadi (socialists) and others - rather than Congress, what right do you have to ask questions about democracy since you have joined hands with the party which murdered democracy in the country,"" he said.""The night before Emergency was the longest night after independence, because its morning came 21 months later, when the country's democracy was revived again,"" he added.""The main reason for Emergency was hunger for power; there was no external threat to the country, nor was there any internal crisis, the threat was only to the chair of the then PM Indira Gandhi,"" he said.Shah said India could not accept dictatorship as the country was the birthplace of democracy.Recalling the 1977 Lok Sabha polls, which Congress lost, Shah said, ""I remember, from our village, we were in a truck outside The Times of India building watching Lok Sabha results.

For the man, senior advocate Sanjay Hegde said his client had paid an OTS of Rs 3 crore to the woman, from whom he had sought divorce because of her adulterous life.However, the bench said ""there is no OTS when children are concerned"".

INDORE: New CCTV footage that surfaced on Saturday in Raja Raghuvanshi murder case shows prime accused Raj Kushwaha holding a white shroud and a floral garland while standing outside the victim's residence on the day of his funeral.The footage, captured on June 4 when Raja's body was brought to his Indore home, shows Raj not only participating in the rituals but also consoling Sonam Raghuwanshi's father, Devi Singh. Raj is seen placing his hand on Devi Singh's shoulder and remaining close to him throughout the mourning.While pictures of Raj consoling Sonam's father had gone viral on social media earlier, this footage has raised suspicion as it shows him making repeated phone calls during the funeral. Investigators suspect he may have been relaying real-time updates from the house, possibly to Sonam.Officials are now trying to determine whom Raj was communicating with during the funeral and whether the calls were connected to a larger conspiracy behind Raja's murder. ""He was so confident and had the audacity to place a shroud on the coffin of my brother whose murder he conspired. He kept talking to someone on phone during the mourning.We realised this later when we checked the CCTVs. Probably he was talking to Sonam,"" said Vipin Raghuwanshi, Raja's brother.Both Sonam and Raj Kushwaha were produced in court on Saturday and have been sent to judicial custody for 13 days. Three other co-accused are already in jail.A Shillong police team, which is stationed in Indore since Tuesday, continues to question individuals linked to the case.

Yes, absolutely No, they're unnecessary





MUMBAI: Almost one-third of those who have died on the railway lines in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region over the past 15 years have remained unclaimed, an RTI response has revealed.The number of people who remained unidentified after losing their lives in train accidents on the suburban network make up 31% (14,513) of the total people (46,969) who died. They could not be restored to their next of kin despite efforts of the Govt Railway Police (GRP).Data obtained through the RTI plea by orthopaedic Dr Sarosh Mehta shows the percentage of unclaimed bodies started to rise from 2019 onward.Establishing the identity of a railway accident victim is challenging, said police personnel. Sometimes the bodies are mangled beyond recognition and belongings like phones or identity cards are not found.The GRP used to run a website called Shodh, where pictures of unidentified victims were put up along with their details and helped their families find them. But the project was wound up. The GRP also started a campaign where banners with pictures of accident victims were put up at railway stations in a bid to identify them, but passengers found them to be disturbing and they were taken off.""Typically when the victim's identity is not known, the body is kept at a morgue for 15 days to a month. The victim's photograph is sent to police stations across the metropolitan region to find out if a missing complaint has been registered by his/her family. If a claimant does not come forward, then the body is cremated or buried as per the victim's faith (if it is known),"" said a police officer. A piece of clothing or the victim's personal belongings are retained in the police records along with the victim's photo in case his/her family is traced later. Despite challenges, police teams sometimes track down the next of kin through tatoos on the victim's body or tags on his/her clothing.Dr Mehta said often the morgues are full and unclaimed bodies cannot be kept beyond a few days.Between 2002 and 2024, over 72,000 people lost their lives on railway lines due to various reasons, a majority run over while crossing tracks.Data shows overall fatalities have been decreasing every year since 2012. The only exception was 2022 when people stuck at home due to the pandemic started returning to work on the city's lifeline.Dr Mehta said that incidents like track crossing and falling off trains were preventable with measures like boundary walls and closed-door coaches.The Railways have been constructing foot over-bridges and installing escalators to discourage track crossing. But with the number of annual deaths still in four-figures, there is a long way to go to achieve the Railways' mission of zero deaths.","Almost one-third of those who have died on the railway lines in the mumbai metropolitan region over the past 15 years have remained unclaimed.

Also the software was not updated to the current version,” the DGCA said in a statement.“All the findings observed during the surveillance have been communicated to the concerned operators for taking necessary corrective actions within seven days.”The critical areas under surveillance include: flight operations, airworthiness, ramp safety, air traffic control (ATC), communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) systems, and pre-flight medical evaluations. “Throughout the surveillance, ground activities and aircraft movements were closely monitored to check the compliance of regulatory requirements and to identify weak areas for improvement,” an official said.The action comes after the DGCA on June 19 ordered a focused assessment of the aviation ecosystem to strengthen safety measures across the sector.","The audit was announced on june 19 and since then two teams of the directorate general of civil aviation (dgca) led by joint dgs have fanned out at major airports.

NEW DELHI: The two Kashmiris arrested by National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Sunday not only harboured the three Pahalgam attackers for two days in their 'dhok' (hut) in Hill Area, located around 2 km from Baisaran, before the latter headed out to massacre 26 civilians but also tipped them off on the deployment of security personnel in and around the attack site ""in return for a few thousand rupees"".Sources aware of NIA probe told TOI that three Pakistani terrorists affiliated to Lashkar were sheltered by accused Parvaiz Ahmad Jothar and Bashir Ahmad Jothar in the seasonal 'dhok' on April 20 and 21, immediately preceding the fateful day. NIA had said on Sunday the accused ""knowingly provided the Pakistani terrorists food, shelter & other logistical support"".On Monday, Parvaiz and Bashir were produced before the NIA court in Jammu, which remanded them to NIA custody for five days. The agency said though the accused had disclosed the identities of the three attackers, it was carefully analysing a ""large body of evidence"" gathered, including eyewitness accounts, video footage, technical evidence and sketches released by J&K police. ""NIA has not reached any conclusions. .. the identities and further details of the terrorists will be made public at an appropriate time,"" the agency said.A source told TOI that Parvaiz and Bashir were not just passive supporters but active facilitators in the April 22 terror act involving the gunning down of 25 tourists based on their religious identity.""They studied the area domination exercises undertaken from time to time and the pattern of security deployment at the attack site in Baisaran, and shared the report or findings with the Pakistani terrorists, helping them plan their approach to the attack site, the actual massacre as well as the subsequent escape,"" an officer told TOI.""The accused were fully aware of the plans to hit tourists since Baisaran was teeming with visitors at the time. Since they were also operating pony rides in the area, they were fully aware of the police/security pickets at the attack site, the gap between consecutive area domination exercises and the pattern of deployment of troops at the site. Despite being aware of the terrorists' intentions, they willingly shared these details, making themselves active participants in the Pahalgam terror attack conspiracy,"" a source said.When confronted by NIA, Parvaiz and Bashir claimed that though they knew of plans to unleash a terror strike, they had no idea that tourists in Baisaran were the target. This explanation, however, has few takers.

Poll Do you think the extension of the deadline for opting into the Unified Pension Scheme is beneficial for employees? Yes, it provides more clarity. No, it delays the decision.

NEW DELHI: After a campaign for assured pension, there is only a small proportion of central govt employees who have opted for the Unified Pension Scheme , offering assured 50 per cent pension, with several seeking further clarifications to exercise the one-time option.As a result, govt has extended the June-end deadline by three months. Employees want to be absolutely sure about the terms of the agreement before deciding to switch to UPS.A concern for employees who joined national pension system from 2004 is the lack of clarity on death benefits. While an assurance was given last week, there are still a few issues that are to be resolved.Under the UPS, while an employee will contribute 10 per cent of his or her salary towards pension, a matching contribution will be made by the Centre, which was 14 per cent under NPS. Under the new scheme, apart from the 10 per cent pension payment, another 8.5 per cent contribution is to be made by the Centre which will not reflect in the balance of the subscriber’s account. While most employees understand the change, there are some who believe that the payout may be lower.Further, some of the all India service officers want to know about the difference in contribution between the Centre and states, which don’t have a scheme yet.An IAS, IPS or Indian Forest Service officer spends time in the state with some of them also opting for central deputation. While the rules are quite clear, some of the officers have raised doubts.Meanwhile, fund managers, who have been asked to conduct outreach programmes, are smelling a rat and allege that some private players are sowing doubts as they stand to lose out on the annuity business under UPS.Employees now have time to exercise the switching option up to the end of September. The option can be exercised by 23 lakh government employees.",Only a small proportion of central govt employees have opted for the unified pension scheme.

Mamata Banerjee Slams BJP as Over 300 Bengal Workers Jailed in Rajasthan for Speaking Bengali

Poll Do you believe that language should be a criterion for labeling individuals as illegal immigrants? Yes, it should be considered. No, it should not be considered.

Centre steps up crackdown on illegal Bangladeshis

Centre vs state over illegal Bangladeshis

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee alleged on Tuesday that Bengali migrant workers speaking their native language outside the state were being ""labelled as Bangladeshis and sent to Bangladesh"".Accusing the BJP of ""playing politics over language"", the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief said many such cases come to her notice and that her government has brought the workers sent to Bangladesh back.""People from every section live in our country. This is India’s secular tradition... but the BJP is doing politics based on language... The migrant workers from Bengal are taken to other states for work because of their skills, but when they speak in the Bengali language among themselves, they are labelled as Bangladeshis and sent to Bangladesh. Many such cases have come to us, and we have brought them back (from Bangladesh),"" the West Bengal CM was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.She futher said: ""Another such case has come from Rajasthan, where 300 to 400 people have been labelled as Bangladeshis. What is happening? They are not Bangladeshis, they have their own identity, they are residents of West Bengal, and West Bengal is a state of India.""Last month, as many as 121 suspected Bangladeshi nationals were apprehended in a week and sent to a detention centre in a fresh, widespread crackdown to curb illegal immigration.The 121 had allegedly crossed the border illegally a few years ago and were working as ragpickers or doing odd jobs in Delhi.During the investigation, police also detained five Indians who provided the suspected Bangladeshis accommodation on rent. These people were questioned to determine their role in facilitating the illegal stay of the foreigners.Last week, thirty-six people, believed to be Bangladeshis residing in Delhi illegally with no travel documents, were held in Bharat Nagar in the north-west of the city. The Delhi police said mobile phones that contained banned messaging apps, which allowed them to communicate with relatives in Bangladesh, were found on them.In January this year, Mamata Banerjee had accused BSF of allowing illegal border-crossing by Bangladeshis into the state as part of a ""central government blueprint"", alleging the infiltration was politically motivated to discredit her government.""The border is not guarded by TMC or police; it is guarded by BSF,"" she said.""They are facilitating infiltration, allowing criminals to cross the border, commit murders, and escape. I will write a strong letter to Centre about this issue.""In response, BSF expressed disappointment over the allegations but refrained from escalating the matter. ""We are a responsible force performing our duty at the border. Statements like these dent our morale,"" said Nilotpal Kumar Pandey, spokesperson for BSF's South Bengal Frontier.Later in March, Union home minister Amit Shah, while replying in the Lok Sabha on the Immigration and Foreigners Bill, 2025, accused the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government of obstructing border security efforts by not providing land for fencing and showing mercy to infiltrators.He said, ""The fencing work of 450 km is pending because the West Bengal government is not giving land for it... Whenever the process of fencing is done, the ruling party workers indulge in hooliganism and religious sloganeering. The fencing work of 450 km of border has not been completed because the West Bengal government is showing mercy to the infiltrators.""","West bengal chief minister mamata banerjee accuses bjp of ""playing politics over language"" she says migrant workers from bengal are taken to other states for work because of their skills.

The man, wearing a burqa to conceal his identity, had entered her fifth-floor home posing as a friend, after which an argument broke out between them.“Following which he pushed her off the balcony of her home,” the source said. The victim later succumbed to her injuries during the treatment, an official reported on Tuesday.The incident was reported around 8.30 am at Jyoti Nagar police station.
