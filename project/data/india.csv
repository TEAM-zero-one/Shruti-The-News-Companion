Prospects of Leh talks' resumption brighten,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prospects-of-leh-talks-resumption-brighten/articleshow/123960928.cms,"NEW DELHI: The prospects of early resumption of talks between the Centre and the Apex Body, Leh (ABL) on the latter's demand for safeguards for Ladakh, have brightened with ABL agreeing to drop political parties' representatives from its negotiating team and veteran leader Thupstan Chhewang consenting to lead the dialogue once again.Chhewang and Congress leader Nawang Rigzin Jora had resigned from key positions in ABL ahead of a crucial meeting with the home ministry in July this year. This was after the home ministry, following a round of talks with Ladakh representatives in May 2025, introduced a new reservation and domicile policy for the Union Territory, guaranteeing 85% quota to local domiciles in jobs and reserving one-third seats for women in Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Councils (LAHDC).Jora withdrew from the apex body soon after, affirming the Congress' commitment to securing statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh, ostensibly with an eye on upcoming LAHDC elections. Chhewang, on the other hand, objected to ""partisan agendas"" of some ABL constituents and insisted on the talks remaining ""non-political"". These developments had put the talks in a limbo.With the ABL now agreeing to exclude political parties from its delegation negotiating Ladakh's safeguards, in a move to depoliticise the process, Chhewang has finally agreed to return to lead the talks.The decision follows a resolution by the Ladakh Buddhist Association (LBA), urging separation of politics from ABL and persuasion of Chhewang to head the delegation.ABL has now requested the Centre to resume dialogue, amid concerns that political influence and upcoming LAHDC Leh polls had hindered negotiations. Meanwhile, Sonam Wangchuk's hunger strike over demands for statehood and Sixth Schedule status has evoked mixed response, with many netas favouring talks. ""Given the changed circumstances, the home ministry is inclined to call the APL to the negotiating table soon,"" a central govt officer told TOI.","Talks between centre and the apex body, leh (abl) on the latter's demand for safeguards for ladakh have brightened.

Sanitation worker dies in bid to save 1 from manhole,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sanitation-worker-dies-in-bid-to-save-1-from-manhole/articleshow/123960509.cms,"'No mask, oxygen or even cloth given to cover face'

NEW DELHI: A labourer, 40, died and two of his colleagues are critical after being sent into a manhole to repair and clean it in northwest Delhi's Ashok Vihar Phase-II late on Tuesday night. None of them had any safety equipment.When the first worker collapsed after inhaling poisonous fumes, another went in to save him and died. The third, who tried to rescue the two, lost consciousness.Police called the manager of a company, which engaged the three on contractual basis, for questioning. They registered a case under several sections, including one banning manual scavenging.According to police, information about the people falling inside a sewer near Harihar apartments was received via a PCR call at Ashok Vihar police station at 11.30pm.""Arvind, along with three others, Sonu and Narayan, also from Kasganj, and Naresh from Bihar, entered a sewer as part of ongoing cleaning work when they fell unconscious, allegedly due to toxic gases,"" a senior police officer said.Arvind was rushed to DDU Hospital, where he was declared brought dead. The other two, Sonu(45) and Naresh (30) remain in critical condition in the ICU.At Deep Chand Babu Hospital's ICU ward, Narayan (32), one of the workers, told TOI, ""I was the one who opened the lid of the sewer that day,"" he said.""After that, Sonu was told to go inside. We had tied a rope around his waist, but no safety equipment was provided to him. He wasn't given any mask, no oxygen, not even a cloth to cover his face. He was just asked to go down and cut a pipe that was inside the sewer for some repair and cleaning work.""The moment Sonu cut the pipe, we saw him collapse. He just fell unconscious inside. To save him, Arvind immediately tied himself with the same rope and went in. But as soon as he reached down, he too fell unconscious. After that, Naresh tried to go in and bring them out, but the same thing happened to him. One after another, all three of them collapsed inside that sewer,"" Narayan said. ""I raised an alarm and shouted for help. Some locals gathered and together we somehow managed to pull them out with the rope. But by then all three were completely unconscious. They went in only to save each other. That's how we lost him.""Arvind was the sole breadwinner of his family, which includes his wife and two young sons aged 12 and 7. His daily earnings ranged between Rs 500 and Rs 800 and the family depended entirely on that income.

Not God But Man?

Anxiety & Anger

KULLU/DEHRADUN: This monsoon, from Kullu to Kalimpong, Kishtwar to Karnaprayag, landslides, flash floods and ground subsidence sharpened the focus on how India's expanding network of highways, tunnels, ropeways and hydropower dams is affecting the fragile Himalayan terrain. While officials insist these were natural calamities, a growing number of residents, scientists and campaigners point to unscientific construction as a key driver.In many towns and villages in India's hills, protests have intensified over cracked homes, vanished springs and roads that collapsed as quickly as they were built.Earlier this week, Supreme Court said the entire Himalayan range was facing an ecological crisis. And that conditions were ""very violent"" this year. Talking about its suo motu examination of environmental issues facing not just Himachal but also Uttarakhand and other states, the top court wondered if there was a link between the spate of rain-related events and the fast-paced construction of roads, hydro schemes, buildings and other big infrastructure projects currently on.Visible scars appeared recently on the 197km Chandigarh-Manali highway, where large sections slumped after cutting by National Highways Authority of India left near-vertical slopes of sand and gravel vulnerable to heavy rain.Carriageways were buried, tunnels flooded, and the Beas was choked with debris.""There used to be hardly any landslides,"" said Kullu environmentalist Guman Singh. ""Then came NHAI with its vertical cuts and created a mess of a road."" Former Geological Survey of India director Om Narain Bhargava called the technique ""a horrible mistake"". Villagers demanded relocation and compensation after their homes developed cracks.Activist Madan Sharma called it ""the most dangerous road ever built,"" while state rural development minister Anirudh Singh launched a 'Justice for Himachal' campaign, saying the highway had created ""more problems than it solved."" A state climate report had already warned that such cutting would ""exacerbate land instability.""Sharp disagreements over the cause of recent calamities have surfaced in Uttarakhand next door. Chief secretary Anand Bardhan told TOI there was ""no technical or scientific study"" linking large infrastructure to natural disasters, citing the flash flood in Dharali, which killed several, as an example of a disaster in a zone without major projects. He added that ropeways to Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib had not yet begun and cautioned against speculation.Campaigners, however, said the impacts were widespread. ""All ecological and local factors have been sidelined,"" said Brijesh Sati of the Char Dham Teerth Purohit Mahapanchayat. ""It would not be wrong to say these disasters are man-made. We are not against development, but it must respect ecology."" He said 50,000 pilgrims completed the Char Dham yatra in 1905 without roads and that even in 2000, road broadening was done without felling trees.Expert opinion from the Supreme Court's high-powered committee on the Char Dham project underscored the risks. Environmentalist Ravi Chopra, who chaired the committee, explained that Uttarakhand's Himalayan ranges emerged from three major faults. ""Even though the rock may be strong, the slopes are weak. During field visits we saw them weakened further by deforestation and unscientific road-cutting - slopes of 60 degrees were carved where even 30 degrees is unsafe. "" He added that climate change had increased the frequency of disasters.Evidence of man-made pressures came from across the scientific community. S K Bartarya, former senior hydrogeologist at the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, said both human activity and climate change were to blame. ""Drying of water bodies are surfacing across the Himalayas. To understand the impact of projects we need cause-factor analysis to separate man-made pressures from climatic ones.""Lived memory offers its own testimony. Uttarkashi-based campaigner Suresh Bhai said, ""Floods from Kedarnath in 2013 to Joshimath in 2023 show the health of the Himalayas is being spoiled. Development at the cost of ecology requires reassessment.""IPCC author Anjal Prakash called big projects in the mountains ""disaster multipliers"" that destabilise slopes. Shruti Narayan of C40 said infrastructure in fragile zones must be based on scientific evidence ""or risk becoming victims of the very calamities they claim to overcome.""Anxiety has become part of daily life in Sikkim, where a glacial lake outburst flood in Oct 2023 destroyed the Rs 1,200 crore Teesta III dam within minutes, swept away more than a dozen bridges on NH-10, and killed over 90 people. A July 2025 report said many families now kept their bags packed at night, unsure of early warning systems. The Sevoke-Rangpo railway tunnel continued beneath slopes some locals said were still settling. In Pakyong and Namchi, natural springs used for drinking and irrigation had begun drying. A travel magazine recorded complaints that newly widened roads lacked drainage. ""We are not engineers,"" a villager said, ""but we live here. We know when the mountain is being hurt.""In Himachal's Lahaul & Spiti, hundreds marched in May against the proposed Seli and Miyar schemes, alleging that avalanche risks had been ignored and impact assessments withheld.With landslides increasing, extreme rain events rising and traditional water sources vanishing, the future of infrastructure in the Himalayas now hinges on whether engineers and planners can align ambition with the limits of the land.","India's expanding network of highways, tunnels, ropeways and hydropower dams is affecting the fragile himalayan terrain. Residents, scientists and campaigners point to unscientific construction as a key driver. Protesters have intensified over cracked homes, vanished springs and roads that collapsed as quickly as they were built.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123960372,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-2015235,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Key cultural and social themes of this year’s celebrations include:

Unity and national pride among Emirati citizens.

Inclusion and participation of the UAE’s large expatriate community, invited to take part in public festivities.

A continued emphasis on modernity integrated with tradition, evident in the use of drone shows and digital storytelling alongside heritage performances.





The United Arab Emirates is preparing for an especially elaborate celebration of its 54th National Day, observed annually on December 2. Authorities have officially declared December 2 and 3 (Tuesday and Wednesday) as public holidays, with strong speculation that December 1 (Monday) may also be granted as a holiday—potentially creating a four- or even five-day weekend. As the country marks more than half a century of union, preparations are underway for one of the largest Eid Al Etihad commemorations to date, blending deep-rooted cultural traditions with high-tech spectacles across the seven emirates.The UAE Cabinet has confirmed December 2 and 3, 2025 as official public holidays in honour of Eid Al Etihad, or Festival of the Union, commemorating the founding of the nation on December 2, 1971. With these days falling on a Tuesday and Wednesday, the inclusion of Monday, December 1, as a holiday could extend the break to four days, or possibly five depending on the weekend alignment.This potential long weekend is expected to benefit both social and economic activities. Residents and families will have more time to travel within the country, participate in public festivities, or take advantage of the extended holiday period for leisure or short-term vacations.Authorities have not yet confirmed the status of December 1, but based on prior years and UAE holiday policies, there is growing anticipation that an official announcement will follow soon.The UAE’s 54th National Day celebrations are set to feature a series of expansive and coordinated events across all emirates, with major public and private venues playing host to cultural, entertainment, and community-focused programs.These innovations highlight the UAE’s unique fusion of cultural heritage and modern innovation.Public transportation services across major cities are expected to extend operational hours, while law enforcement and municipal bodies are preparing traffic and safety protocols to manage the anticipated increase in footfall at celebration venues.At the centre of the celebrations will be a grand official ceremony on Tuesday, December 2, to be attended by the UAE’s leadership. While the venue for the main event has not yet been revealed, organisers have confirmed it will be a site of deep cultural and national relevance.In 2024, the ceremony was held at Jebel Hafeet in Al Ain, where the nation’s heritage and vision for the future were presented through immersive storytelling and performances. A similarly meaningful location is expected to be selected for the 2025 event, and details are expected to be made public in the coming weeks.Preparations officially began on Union Pledge Day, marking the symbolic start of a nationwide effort to build an inclusive, celebratory experience that reflects the UAE’s values of unity and diversity.The 54th National Day serves as a reminder of the UAE’s evolution from its unification in 1971 into a global centre for innovation, commerce, and cross-cultural engagement. Eid Al Etihad is not only a time of celebration but also of reflection—honouring the nation’s history while highlighting its ambitions for the future.Organisers have also released behind-the-scenes footage from the 2024 ceremony, showcasing the depth of planning and artistic execution that goes into these annual events. The footage aims to build excitement and demonstrate the UAE’s commitment to making National Day a culturally resonant and visually compelling occasion.On the economic front, long public holidays like these are known to boost local tourism and retail sectors, with increased activity in hotels, restaurants, and shopping destinations. Travel agencies typically report a spike in bookings, as residents look to make the most of the extended break for domestic or short international getaways. This year’s celebrations are also expected to set new records in tourism and retail spending, reflecting the growing impact of National Day on the UAE’s economy.","Uae national day 2025 includes december 2–3 holidays, major cultural events, fireworks, and possible long weekend.

Tejashwi Yadav's Bihar Adhikar Yatra: Consolidating Rahul Gandhi's gains or establishing pre-eminence in alliance?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tejashwi-yadavs-bihar-adhikar-yatra-consolidating-rahul-gandhis-gains-or-establishing-pre-eminence-in-alliance/articleshow/123951337.cms,"Tejashwi Yadav launched 'Bihar Adhikar Yatra' to challenge Nitish Kumar's government on unemployment and crime, following the 'Voter Adhikaar Yatra' led by Rahul Gandhi. This solo move, amidst CM face debates and seat-sharing talks, aims to assert RJD's dominance in the Mahagathbandhan.

'No Confusion Regarding CM's Face' Tejashwi Yadav’s Sharp Reply on INDIA Bloc CM Candidate

NEW DELHI: RJD leader and former Bihar deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav on Tuesday launched 'Bihar Adhikar Yatra' from Jehanabad to raise pitch against Nitish Kumar-led NDA government over issues of unemployment and increasing crime incidents among others ahead of the upcoming assembly elections.Interestingly, Tejashwi's solo yatra comes close on the heels of the much-hyped ""Voter Adhikaar Yatra"" which included all Mahagathbandhan leaders and was led by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi . Tejashwi was part of the Voter Adhikaar Yatra, but the limelight was hogged by Rahul - who has been leading a campaign against alleged vote theft across the country accusing the Election Commission of helping the BJP.The RJD, which is going all out to dethrone Nitish Kumar led NDA government in the state, asserted that Tejasjwi's yatra will cover districts which were left out in the 'Voter Adhikaar Yatra'.""After the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', some districts were left out. All our workers and leaders from these districts demanded that these areas should be covered, so Tejashwi ji took the decision to take out this yatra respecting their feelings,"" RJD MP Sanjay Yadav said yesterday when asked about the launch of the yatra.Also read: 'Hydrogen bomb' incoming? Rahul Gandhi to hold special presser on Sept 18; 'vote chori' row set to intensify However, the fact that this new yatra comes amid an ongoing debate over Mahagathbandhan's CM face and also inconclusive seat-sharing talks makes one wonder if the RJD leader has other objectives in mind also.Recently, the RJD leader had surprised all when during a rally in Muzaffarpur he pronounced: “And this time, Tejashwi will contest all 243 seats, whether it is Muzaffarpur, Kanti or Bochahan.”Tejashwi's remarks, more than anything, was perhaps an attempt to stamp his pre-eminence as the leader of the opposition alliance across the state.However, Tejashwi later explained that there is ""no confusion"" regarding the chief ministerial face in the opposition bloc and the name will be announced at the ""right time.""So, the question is why was such an assertion needed in the first place? After all, RJD is the largest party in the alliance and in the last elections had won 75 seats, which was the highest as it was one more than BJP's tally.However, as the opposition alliance gears up for the assembly elections, the Congress has refused to openly endorse Tejashwi as Mahagathbandhan's CM face. During the ""Voter Adhikaar Yatra"", when Rahul Gandhi was pointedly asked why Congress was not endorsing Tejashwi as the CM face, he evaded a direct reply and instead spoke of a good understanding between the partners. This, despite the fact, that Tejashwi had earlier openly announced that Rahul would become the Prime Minister once the opposition won the next Lok Sabha elections.When asked why the Congress was not backing Tejashwi Yadav as the chief ministerial face in Bihar, Rahul Gandhi said: ""A very strong partnership had been forged. All the parties (in the bloc) are working in sync. There's no tension, and there's mutual respect to help each other as we are ideologically and politically aligned. The result will be good. But the vote theft needs to be stopped.""Rahul's reply was clearly a calculated and clever deflection of announcing party's stand on the leadership issue in Bihar. The Congress leader, riding high on his successful ""vote chori"" campaign, was perhaps not willing to lose the bargaining chip so easily.Also read: Bigger, in colour: EC's new norms for EVM ballot papers; first roll-out in Bihar polls

The seat-sharing talks are underway and all parties are posturing for a higher share. In the 2020 assembly elections, the Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested 144 seats and won 75. The Congress had the worst strike rate as it contested 70 seats but won only 19. In fact, the Left parties had performed very well with the CPI-ML winning 12 out of 19, CPM 2 out of 4 and CPI 2 out of 6.This time around more parties have joined the opposition alliance and hence seat-sharing will not be an easy exercise. Already there are reports of pressure on both the RJD and the Congress to reduce their share so that other parties can be accommodated.While the Congress in Bihar is in no position to question his leadership within the alliance, they can pile pressure on the RJD during seat sharing talks. This, perhaps, explains why RJD and its leader Tejashwi have embarked on a campaign to ensure their pre-eminence in the alliance is not questioned.","Tejashwi yadav launched 'bihar adhikar yatra' to challenge nitish kumar's government on unemployment and crime.

Media is requested to be seated by 9.30 am.""This comes after Rahul had warned Bharatiya Janata Party of a new expose on alleged ""vote chori"" claims, claiming that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would not be able to ""show his face to people after we bring hydrogen bomb of 'vote chori'.""""I want to tell the BJP people. Have you heard of anything bigger than an atom bomb, it is a hydrogen bomb. BJP people, be ready, a hydrogen bomb is coming. People are soon going to find out the reality of vote chori,"" he said.""In the coming time, I am guaranteeing you that after the hydrogen bomb (comes), Narendra Modi ji will not be able to show his face to the country,"" he added.Earlier, Rahul had unveiled what he had described as an “atom bomb” of evidence against the Election Commission On August 7, citing data from the Mahadevapura assembly segment, which falls under the Bengaluru Central parliamentary constituency in Congress-ruled Karnataka, he accused the poll body of “colluding” with the BJP.Rahul said the Congress had analysed the Mahadevapura electoral rolls over six months and found that out of 1,00,250 alleged bogus voters, 40,009 had “fake and invalid addresses” and 10,452 were “bulk voters” registered at common addresses. Examples included entries with “0” in the address field, non-existent locations, and addresses that could not be verified.Rahul also accused the EC of colluding with the BJP to “destroy Indian democracy and steal elections,” and argued that if the EC does not provide electronic voter data of 10–15 years and CCTV footage, then it is “partaking in crime,” since these are now “evidence of crime.” He urged the judiciary to intervene to save Indian democracy.Citing the study, Rahul claimed the BJP won Bangalore Central by 32,707 votes while 1,00,250 fake votes were polled in its favor. He said the fake votes fell into five categories: duplicate voters (11,965), fake/invalid addresses (40,009), bulk voters at a single address (10,452), invalid photos of voters (4,132), and “misuse of Form 6” for first-time voters (33,692).Showing files, he cited examples to argue that people had voted multiple times in different booths of the seat, while voter list addresses included “Street 0” and “House no. 0.” He said there were cases where as many as 80 voters were shown at one address, or 50 in a single one-bedroom house, and that attempts to cross-check resulted in either researchers being beaten up or confirmation that the voters did not live there.","Congress leader rahul gandhi will hold a ""special press briefing"" on thursday.

19 dead this year: 'Brain-eating' amoeba sparks political slugfest in Kerala House,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/19-dead-this-year-brain-eating-amoeba-sparks-political-slugfest-in-kerala-house/articleshow/123956442.cms,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The ""brain-eating"" parasitic infection amoebic meningoencephalitis has killed a three-month-old, a 52-year-old, and 17 others across Kerala this year. On Wednesday, grief turned into fury in the assembly, where opposition accused LDF government of presiding over a health system in free fall.Congress-led UDF moved an adjournment motion, saying 19 people had died this year from the rare infection, including Lathakumari of Thiruvananthapuram last week. The notice charged the government with ignoring awareness campaigns at local level, where those exposed to stagnant water are most at risk. It also flagged rising cases of jaundice, dengue, leptospirosis, typhoid and diarrhoeal diseases - calling the situation a ""collapse of public health management"".Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is rare. Globally, fewer than 500 cases have ever been reported. Yet Kerala has seen over 120 so far, including 68 this year. Infection occurs when contaminated freshwater enters the nose, letting the amoeba reach the brain through the sinus and destroy tissue.On Sept 1, an infant and a woman died while under treatment at Kozhikode Govt Medical College Hospital. ""We are providing the best possible treatment, including the imported drug miltefosine,"" principal KG Sajeeth Kumar had said, adding that both were infected by the same Naegleria fowleri strain.Govt has launched Jalamanu Jeevan (water is life), a statewide chlorination drive covering wells, swimming pools and tanks.Congress' VD Satheesan lashed out: ""Eight people died in 15 days. What is the protocol? What are people supposed to do? Even a baby was infected - was that child in a swimming pool?""Health minister Veena George hit back with a data-heavy defence, calling the charges a smear. ""Congress is trying to run down health sector. They say treatment outside govt hospitals is cheaper-who are they helping?""She highlighted Kerala's gains: infant mortality down from 12 during UDF's tenure to five today; liver transplants successful and free at Kottayam MCH; 13 district hospitals equipped with cath labs. She cited crisis response: ""When Nipah, with 70% fatality rate, struck, we brought it down to 33%."" But her repeated comparisons with UDF's record from a decade ago rang hollow to critics.Satheesan accused George of dodging accountability: ""Kerala's health is on a ventilator, yet the minister hides behind old numbers. From Rs 5,419 in 2016-17, per capita out-of-pocket health expense has risen to Rs 7,889 Instead of acting, state govt reacts after lives are lost.""","Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is rare.

PATNA: The court of Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM), Darbhanga, Junaid Alam has rejected the regular bail plea of the man who is currently under judicial custody on the charges of using abusive language against the PM Narendra Modi and his mother on August 27 from a platform erected by the local Congress leaders to welcome party leader Rahul Gandhi during his ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ from Darbhanga to Muzaffarpur in Bihar.“The court of the CJM rejected the regular bail plea of accused Mohammad Rizvi alias Raja (20) on Tuesday. The bail petition was rejected mainly on the ground that the accused Rizvi has confessed his involvement in the crime during his statement before the investigating officer,” advocate Md Murshid Ansari, who moved the bail petition, told TOI over phone from Darbhanga on Wednesday.The accused Mohammad Rizvi alias Raja (20) is lodged in the Darbhanga district jail since August 29. He was sent to jail hours after his arrest on the same day.Mohammad Rizvi came into the spotlight on Aug 28 after a video in which he allegedly used abusive language against the PM and his mother went viral on social media. This prompted BJP’s Darbhanga district president Aditya Narain Choudhary to lodge an FIR with Simri police station against certain persons.During investigation, Simri police identified the man in the viral video as Rizvi of Bhapoora village. According to police, he had used abusive language against the PM and his mother on Aug 27 from a platform erected by local Congress leaders to welcome party leader Rahul Gandhi during his ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’ from Darbhanga to Muzaffarpur.Police, in its investigation report, said Rizvi allegedly mounted the dais and used abusive language after Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders had already left for Muzaffarpur.","Mohammad rizvi came into the spotlight on aug 28 after a video in which he allegedly used abusive language against the pm and his mother went viral on social media.

NEW DELHI: After Bihar, the stage is set for a special intensive revision of electoral rolls in Delhi, with the Election Commission on Wednesday uploading the voter list of 2002 and mapping it with present constituencies.In a post on X, CEO Delhi wrote, “CEO Delhi has started preparations for successful conduct of SIR-2025 in Delhi. Voter list of SIR-2002 and mapping with present constituencies uploaded.”Earlier, as a precursor to ordering a pan-India special revision of electoral rolls, the EC held a meeting with chief electoral officers (CEOs) of all states and UTs to assess their preparedness. The meeting focused on reviewing records of the last intensive revision, the current status of the voter list, and gathering suggestions on state/UT-specific documents that may be accepted to establish eligibility for inclusion in the rolls.The EC is expected to announce a nationwide SIR soon, possibly later this month or early next month. This exercise will replace the annual Special Summary Revision (SSR), with January 1, 2026 as the reference date, as earlier reported by TOI.The Bihar SIR, announced in June, faced sharp criticism from opposition parties, which alleged that crores of eligible citizens risked losing their voting rights due to lack of proper documents. Following this, the Supreme Court directed the EC to ensure that no eligible voter is excluded from the rolls.According to the poll panel, the primary aim of the SIR is to identify and remove “foreign illegal migrants” by verifying place-of-birth details of applicants and existing voters.","After bihar, stage is set for a special intensive revision of electoral rolls in delhi.

It has said that any ""unauthorised subcontracting and subcontracting beyond permissible limits will be classified as 'undesirable practice', thereby attracting penalties on par with fraudulent practices"".The changes in the bid document have been made months after the issue of subcontracting at multiple levels was raised at a meeting chaired by PM Narendra Modi. TOI on June 9 had reported about the PM's direction to the road transport and highways ministry to formulate ""clear norms and standards"" for subcontractors.NHAI said instances had been observed where concessionaires or selected bidders had engaged contractors without the required prior approval of the authority or exceeded the permissible subcontracting limits. It added that such practices not only violated contractual norms but also posed risks to quality assurance, project timelines and regulatory oversight.The parliamentary PAC in its recent report had raised concerns over the practice of subcontracting in highway projects while flagging that ""unchecked layering"" of contractors and subcontractors had led to diffusion of accountability.NHAI said the provision of ""similar work"" criteria in bid qualification had been clarified considering how it had been often misrepresented by contractors seeking to become eligible for large-scale projects despite having experience only in minor or peripheral works.","National highways authority of india (nhai) has tightened norms to check ""unathorised"" subcontracting of works by main highway builders.
