‘GST Bachat Utsav’ Kicks Off: Modi Unveils Reforms for Middle Class, Farmers

(Inputs from agencies)

KOLKATA/T'PURAM: Bengal and Kerala welcomed lower GST rates for easing costs to households but warned that states will shoulder crippling losses in revenue, accusing Centre of passing the burden while taking credit.Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said Monday her state would forfeit Rs 20,000 crore because of the decision, though she backed it for the sake of consumers. ""How will I run the state in such a condition?"" she asked after inaugurating a Durga Puja in Kolkata. ""No compensation was given to states on account of lowered GST rates, the money was simply cut from our GST share.""""I will place the truth before the people, take out ads to make sure they know the loss we suffered. This is no credit to central govt,"" she said. Banerjee reminded that she was the first to demand insurance be exempt from GST and pointed to anomalies: ""Many life-saving medicines and small items had GST. There was GST on jeere (cumin) but not on heere (diamond)."" Banerjee demanded whether Delhi would return funds withheld for 100 days' work, Awas Yojana, roads, Jal Swapno and Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.Trinamool national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee sharpened the attack.""PM Modi yesterday said 'GST Bachat Utsav'. Was it 'GST Loot Utsav' since 2017?"" he asked.In Kerala, finance minister KN Balagopal warned of a ""substantial fall"" in revenues. He estimated Kerala's potential loss at between Rs 50,000 crore and Rs 2 lakh crore, directly affecting social security pensions, salaries and development projects. ""States have no alternative avenues to raise such revenue. With 41% of overall state income coming from GST, the impact will be severe if this loss materialises,"" he said, accusing Delhi of pushing reforms without appropriate study. Balagopal cautioned that companies might not pass on the benefit. ""Even Union ministers admitted this concern,"" he said.","Bengal cm mamata banerjee said monday her state would forfeit rs 20,000 crore because of the decision.

"Slow start, tech glitches mar Karnataka caste survey on Day 1",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/slow-start-tech-glitches-mar-karnataka-caste-survey-on-day-1/articleshow/124059348.cms,"BENGALURU: The much-publicised socioeconomic, educational, and political representation survey got off to a sluggish start on Monday, with 1.7 lakh enumerators covering barely 400 houses and 1,100 people in Karnataka by noon. Officials said the pace is expected to pick up in the coming days, with field timings fixed between 9am and 5pm.K A Dayanand, member-secretary of Karnataka State Commission for Backward Classes (KSCBC), attributed the slow beginning to teething troubles. ""Today being Day 1, we expected a slow start, as enumerators had to download these applications and start using them. We will see more traction in the next couple of days,"" he told TOI.Complaints poured in from across the state about delays and glitches in the mobile application used for the exercise. Delays in receiving OTPs for Aadhaar authentication left many respondents impatient.""With enumerators having a larger area to cover, 150 houses per block and asking responses for 60 questions per household, a delay of 2-5 minutes in verifying credentials of respondents has become time-consuming,"" one enumerator said.In several cases, final submissions were not accepted by the software, while poor network connectivity in rural areas compounded the problem.In Bengaluru Urban and Dakshina Kannada districts, fieldwork did not start even by Monday. While officials cited incomplete training as a reason for delays in Bengaluru, confusion reigned in Dakshina Kannada, where enumerators doubling as booth-level officers were also burdened with Election Commission's forthcoming special intensive revision of voter lists.Teachers pressed into the survey raised concerns about downloading the app and securing uninterrupted mobile network. Chandrashekar Nugli, president of Primary School Teachers' Association, said, ""We expect these things to stabilize, with our teachers picking up pace from tomorrow.""Enumerators spoke of the hurdles they faced on Day 1. ""We collected the kit at Ron tahsildar's office. We could only download the app - KSBC Social and Educational Survey - by noon. We were told to do a census of 4-5 houses, but could not do it due to technical difficulties. Some of our colleagues, though, started it, but many of us couldn't,"" Vijayalaxmi, a teacher in Gadag district, said.Kamala, a teacher in Haveri district, said: ""...I started the survey, but the first family failed to provide adequate information, so I couldn't upload the details. I successfully uploaded details from the second house after 3 hours.""","The much-publicised socioeconomic, educational, and political representation survey got off to a sluggish start on monday.

NEW DELHI: Number of polluted river stretches in country has shown a consistent decline from 351 in 2018 to 311 in 2022 and further to 296 in 2025, shows an assessment report of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) released Monday.Two or more polluted locations identified on a river in a continuous sequence are defined as Polluted River Stretch (PRS). Stretches where biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) exceeds 3mg/l are identified as polluted stretches. BOD beyond prescribed levels affects health of aquatic life. A stretch where BOD concentration exceeds 30mg/l is categorised as most polluted stretch.The 2025 assessment, based on river water quality data of 2022 and 2023 at 2,116 locations on rivers across country, shows 37 of 296 PRS were classified as most polluted. This number, however, has dropped from 46 in 2022. These 37 stretches were identified across 14 states, with five each in TN, UP and Uttarakhand; four in Gujarat; and three in Karnataka.Yamuna's stretch from Palla to Asgarpur in Delhi, Sabarmati in Ahmedabad, Chambal's stretch from Nagda to Gandhisagar dam in MP, & stretches of Tungabadhra and Sarabanga in Karnataka and TN, respectively, were among most notable PRS during the assessment period.Jhelum in J&K; Ganga, Ramrekha and Sikrahna in Bihar; Hasdeo and Mahanadi in Chhattisgarh; Sal and Mapusa in Goa; Cauvery and Tungabhadra in Karnataka; Periyar in Kerala; and Amba & Savitri in Maharashtra are among prominent rivers where PRS were seen to have deteriorated in water quality.The report, at the same time, observed improvement in water quality in 220 stretches that were identified as PRS in 2018. ""Of the 220 PRS, 149 river stretches are not identified as polluted stretches due to compliance with BOD criterion,"" said the report.","Number of polluted river stretches in country has shown a consistent decline from 351 in 2018 to 311 in 2022.

Top Maoist Commander Modem Balkrishna Among 10 Killed, 26 Arrested In Chhattisgarh

New Delhi: With the elimination of two more CPI (Maoist) central committee members - Kadari Satyanarayana Reddy alias Kosa and Katta Ramchandra Reddy alias Raju - by security forces on Monday in Chhattisgarh's Narayanpur district, the strength of the outfit's top decision-making body has shrunk by half in the current year, to just 10 members now.The neutralisation of the Maoists drew praise from home minister Amit Shah , who on X said, ""Our security forces are systematically dismantling the top naxal leadership, breaking the backbone of red terror"". The killings reflect the govt's and counter-Naxal forces's stand on dealing firmly with Maoists, notwithstanding the Sept 15 statement by CPI(Maoist) central committee member Mallojula Venugopal Rao alias Sonu, under the nom de guerre 'Abhay', offering to lay down arms and seeking a temporary halt to counter operations.Sonu's peace move has now been disowned by the CPI (Maoist) central committee, politburo, Dandakaranya special zonal committee (DKSZC), in a joint statement dated Sept 20 as ""his individual decision"", not reflecting the view of the party that favours continuation of ""armed struggle"". Earlier, the Telangana state committee too had distanced itself from Sonu's statement.Stating that Sonu had cleverly misrepresented the May 7 opinion of then general secretary Basavaraju on laying down arms, the latest statement - also signed by 'Abhay', a generic name used by any CPI(Maoist) spokesperson - discloses that a subsequent discussion in the core group had led to a rethink, with the military wing, PLGA, and 'rebel cadre' being instructed to continue their armed struggle.The statement - the veracity of which is still being established though senior officers said it appears authentic - called the suggestion of Sonu to consult all CPI(Maoist) formations on talks an ""evil move to break the party"". ""Laying down arms and surrendering before the enemy means converting CPI(Maoist) from a revolutionary outfit to a revisionist outfit...Sonu has no right to digress from the basic line of the party,"" it said.Since Jan 19, 2025 - when central committee leader Chalapathi was neutralised in Gariaband, Chhattisgarh - his colleagues in the apex panel have fallen one after the other. Vivek Manjhi was eliminated in an encounter in Jharkhand on April 21, followed by the 'big kill' - that of general secretary Nambala Keshav Rao alias Basavaraju in Narayanpur on May 21. In June, Thentu Lakshmi alias Sudhakar was neutralised in Chhattisgarh and Gajarla Ravi in Andhra Pradesh. In Sept alone, four central committee members have been eliminated - Modem Balakrishnan alias Bhaskar on Sept 11 in Gariaband, Sahdev Soren on Sept 14 in Jharkhand, and on Monday, Kadari Reddy and Katta Reddy. Another central committee member Sujatha had surrendered before the Telangana Police this month.As of today, CPI(Maoist) has four surviving politburo members - general secretary Thippiri Tirupathi @ Devji, Sonu, Ganapathy and Misir Besra - who are also in the central committee. The other 'active' central committee members are Pulluri Prasad Rao alias Chandranna, Ganesh Uikey, Anal Da, Malla Raji Reddy, Ramder and Madvi Hidma.","The neutralisation of the maoists drew praise from home minister amit shah.

NEW DELHI: The country is set to get an apex empowered agency for preparation of comprehensive transport strategies for all modes of transport and end-to-end mobility . The proposed Integrated Transport Authority comprising planning heads of all related ministries will also carry out monitoring to ensure timely project completion. The proposal is likely to be placed before the Cabinet soon as govt focuses on accelerating transport infrastructure development to enable faster movement of people and goods, and reduce logistics costs.At present, there is a National Project Group under department for promotion of industry and internal trade that evaluates large-scale projects, but it only has an advisory role. Officials said a group of secretaries has recommended the need for an authority similar to those in the US, the UK, Germany, Australia and Japan to handle all transport-related issues. However, they also cautioned the new agency must not become just another bureaucratic layer for going through presentations.",The proposed integrated transport authority comprising planning heads of all related ministries will also carry out monitoring to ensure timely project completion.

"Courts and police are not recovery agents, says SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/courts-and-police-are-not-recovery-agents-says-sc/articleshow/124059217.cms,"NEW DELHI: With police continuing to register FIRs in civil disputes, Supreme Court on Monday said the judiciary and police are not recovery agents and that threat of arrest could not be leveraged to settle such disputes.The remark from a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N K Singh came after it found that a purely civil dispute, involving a monetary amount between two parties, had been converted into a criminal case by the Uttar Pradesh police by registering a case of cheating. Additional solicitor general K M Nataraj said police ends up getting the stick from both sides.If it does not follow the SC diktat for immediate registration of FIR on receiving a complaint disclosing an offence, it is criticised by courts, and if it registers one, it is accused of not applying its mind. The bench understood the damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't predicament of police and said, ""Registration of an FIR does not mean the person accused of the crime is required to be immediately arrested in every case. Police must apply its mind to the nature of the crime and whether it is a civil or criminal offence.""Justice Kant said, ""Such misuse of the criminal law is posing a serious threat to the legal system for dispensation of justice.People think they can use the judiciary and police as recovery agents by instituting criminal cases even when the dispute is purely civil in nature.""The bench suggested that the states could appoint a nodal officer for each district, preferably a retired district judge, who could be consulted by police whenever they have a doubt about the nature of the offence - civil or criminal - reported in the FIR. It asked the additional solicitor general to deliberate the proposal and report back to the court.In April 1 last year, the SC, in Sharif Ahmad vs UP, had ruled that ""any effort to settle civil disputes and claims which do not involve any criminal offence, by way of applying pressure through criminal prosecution, should be deprecated and discouraged."" In another case in April this year, a CJI-led bench had said, ""Converting civil cases into criminal ones by police is unacceptable. If any such incident comes to light in future, we will not hesitate to impose heavy costs on police. """,Supreme court says judiciary and police are not recovery agents.

In a big cheer at the start of the festive season, the next generation GST reforms announced by the Modi government come into effect today, on September 22, 2025.From today, a plethora of household items, cars, TVs, bikes will become cheaper for the common man and middle class. Many food items have been moved to the NIL or 0% tax bracket. These include roti, parantha, paneer, khakra etc. Importantly, health and life insurance premiums will be exempt from GST.The new GST rates, first announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this month, reduce the tax slabs to two broad rates - 5% and 18%. While most items under GST have seen rate cuts, some limited items will now also be dearer with higher tax rates - such as clothes priced above Rs 2,500 will now attract a higher GST rate of 18% compared to 12% before.Ahead of the GST rate cuts becoming effective, PM Narendra Modi addressed the nation saying, “With sunrise on September 22nd, the first day of Navratri, the Next Generation GST reforms will come into effect.In a way, a GST savings festival is going to begin in the country from tomorrow. This GST Savings Festival will increase your savings, and you'll be able to purchase the things you want more easily. The poor, middle class people, neo middle class, youth, farmers, women, shopkeepers, businessmen, entrepreneurs of our country, everyone will benefit a lot from this savings festival. ”“Due to reduction in GST, it will now be easier for the citizens of the country to fulfill their dreams. Be it building a house, buying a TV, a refrigerator, or buying a scooter, bike, or a car, you'll have to spend less on all of these. Travelling will also become cheaper for you, as GST has been reduced on rooms in most hotels,” he added.","New gst rates 2025: full list of items in 0%, 5%, 18% & 40% tax brackets. The 40% tax is for goods that are either categorized as sin or luxury. Citrus fruit, such as oranges, mandarins, tangerines and satsumas; clementines, wilkings and similar citrus hybrids, grapefruit.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124031450,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-61380,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Poll Do you think stricter gun control could prevent such incidents? Yes, stricter laws are needed No, current laws are sufficient





AHMEDABAD: A Gujarati woman was shot dead during a robbery attempt at her convenience store in Union County late Tuesday night.The victim was identified as Kiran Patel, 49, who ran DD's Food Mart on South Pinckney Street.Police said they received a call around 10.30pm about a man firing shots outside the store. When officers arrived, they found Patel lying unresponsive in the parking lot with gunshot wounds. Emergency medical services later confirmed her death.According to investigators, surveillance video captured the sequence of events.A masked man entered the store with a gun and demanded money from Patel, who was working alone.During the confrontation, the assailant fired a shot, and Patel tried to resist by throwing something at him. The robber then climbed onto the cash register counter and fired multiple rounds inside the store.Patel attempted to flee towards the parking lot, but the gunman chased her, continuing to shoot.She collapsed just 20 feet away from the store entrance after being struck by bullets. Officers also recovered shell casings and found the store's front window shattered.The Union County coroner's office confirmed Patel's identity and said she suffered fatal injuries from the gunfire.This tragedy comes at a time when the US is witnessing renewed debate over gun control laws.South Carolina, like many states, allows relatively easy access to firearms, and incidents of violence at small businesses have become frequent. Community members described Patel as a hardworking immigrant who ran the store for years and was well-known in the area.The Union Public Safety Department has launched a manhunt for the suspect, who fled the scene after the shooting.Police said they are reviewing CCTV footage and have appealed to the public for information.","Victim identified as kiran patel, 49, who ran dd's food mart in union county.

Mahagathbandhan in Bihar: Will arithmetic of seat-sharing overshadow chemistry of vote yatra?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mahagathbandhan-in-bihar-will-arithmetic-of-seat-sharing-overshadow-chemistry-of-vote-yatra/articleshow/124003792.cms,"Rahul Gandhi with Tejashwi Yadav and RJD Chief Lalu Prasad during the Voter Adhikar Rally in Sasaram.

'No Confusion Regarding CM's Face' Tejashwi Yadav’s Sharp Reply on INDIA Bloc CM Candidate

Poll Should Congress support RJD's Tejashwi Yadav as the Chief Minister candidate? Yes, he deserves it. No, Congress should lead.

Why seat-sharing deal may be a tough nut to crack?

CPI's D Raja

VIP's Mukesh Sahani

Congress's Krishna Allavaru

RJD, Congress under pressure?

NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi's ""Voter Adhikar Yatra"" in Bihar was a picture-perfect show of unity - with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and RJD 's Tejashwi Yadav joining hands to unleash a coordinated offensive against the Election Commission and the BJP, accusing them of stealing elections. It was a campaign that brought together all the Mahagathbandhan leaders.The chemistry between the allies was obvious and was aptly summed up by Rahul Gandhi when he asserted during the course of the yatra: ""A very strong partnership had been forged. All the parties (in the bloc) are working in sync. There's no tension, and there's mutual respect for each other as we are ideologically and politically aligned. The result will be good.""Ironically though, Rahul made this statement to evade a direct reply to a pointed question - ""Why Congress was not backing RJD's Tejashwi as CM candidate?"" Clearly, the bonhomie on display notwithstanding, the Congress leader was not willing to endorse the leadership role of the senior partner in the Bihar alliance. This despite the fact that Tejashwi had already openly proclaimed during the yatra that if the opposition is voted to power in the next Lok Sabha elections, Rahul will become the Prime Minister.Little wonder then, with the yatra over, realpolitik has taken over. The yatra bonhomie between the allies seems to have given way to pressure games as they finalise the seat-sharing deal. While claims and counterclaims by allies do point to fissures in the alliance, most of this could be posturing to extract the best deal.In the 2020 assembly elections, RJD had contested 144 seats and won 75. The Congress had the worst strike rate as it contested 70 seats but won only 19. The Left parties had performed very well five years back with the CPI-ML winning 12 out of 19 it got under seat-sharing, while CPM won 2 out of 4 and CPI 2 out of 6.This time around, there are at least three more parties joining the opposition alliance: Vikasheel Insaan Party of Mukesh Sahani, JMM and the breakaway faction of LJP - headed by Chirag's uncle.Interestingly, five years back, VIP was part of Mahagathbandhan till the seat-sharing deal was announced. While the announcement was being made, VIP's Sahni walked out of the opposition alliance and crossed over to the NDA. This time around he has sought 60 seats and the post of deputy chief minister if the alliance wins.Sample some of the statements made by the allies for a better bargain this time around, and one understands why finalising a deal may not be easy.""We will try to get more seats. If other parties are demanding, our party has a great history in Bihar and it has a widespread presence and organisational strength and our party can decide the political course in different district. So we should get reasonable number of seats.""""The Vikasheel Insaan Party will contest 60 seats in 2025, with candidates from our allied parties contesting all remaining seats.""""We have always believed that if new parties come into the alliance, then every party will have to contribute from their kitty. In every state there are good seats and bad seats (in terms of winnability) and we believe that one party should not get all the good seats and the other gets the bad ones. In the sharing of seats, there should be a balance between good and bad seats.""""Hopefully, Congress would adopt a ""more realistic"" approach in the ongoing seat-sharing talks for the upcoming assembly elections, drawing lessons from its performance in the 2020 polls when it had ""bitten off more than it could possibly chew. Maybe contesting fewer seats than last time but winning more and performing better... would be in the interest of the Congress, and definitely that of the entire INDIA bloc. ""The pressure is mostly on the RJD, which is the biggest party in the alliance and has maximum stakes. Little wonder, Tejashwi has already embarked on a solo yatra to perhaps assert his dominance in the coalition.For the Congress also, its 2020 performance is a hurdle notwithstanding the claimed gains from Rahul's 'Voter Adhikar' yatra. It remains to be seen how much the two parties are willing to compromise to accommodate the other parties. Clearly, for the Mahagathbandhan, after a smooth yatra, the road ahead appears to be bumpy.","Rahul gandhi's ""voter adhikar yatra"" in bihar was a picture-perfect show of unity.

A joint team of security forces launched a cordon-and-search operation in Malhar area of Kathua district on Monday after the alleged sighting of two terror suspects in the area.

Poll Do you believe that the alleged theft from the Tirumala temple should be thoroughly investigated? Yes, it should be investigated No, it's not necessary

NEW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh’s ruling Telugu Desam Party ( TDP ) leader and MLA Nara Lokesh has alleged that over Rs 100 crore was stolen from the parakamani (donation box) of the Tirumala temple during the YSR Congress Party government led by YS Jagan Mohan Reddy.Lokesh, who is also TDP’s general secretary, shared purported CCTV footage on X on Saturday, claiming it shows large-scale misappropriation of Lord Venkateswara’s offerings.“YCP thieves have looted the sacred property of Lord Venkateswara. YCP leaders are behind the ‘hundred crore Parakamani theft’. During Jagan’s five-year rule, corruption reigned supreme. Anarchy ran rampant. Jagan turned Andhra Pradesh into a haven for thieves, looters, and mafia dons. The Jagan gang plundered mines, lands, forests, and all resources, along with exploiting the people... and in the end, they did not even spare the sacred property of Lord Venkateswara in Tirumala,” Lokesh said in his post.He also accused former Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) Chairman Bhumana Karunakar Reddy of facilitating the scam and claimed that “shares of the loot” reached Tadepalli Palace, the residence of then chief minister Jagan.TTD is the official custodian of Sri Venkateswara temple in Tirupati, the richest Hindu shrine in the world.Lokesh alleged that the stolen funds were diverted into real estate and attempts were made to “settle” the matter in a Lok Adalat. “With the backing of power, Jagan’s gang committed every possible sacrilege against Lord Venkateswara,” he added.""The sins of Jagan’s gang, the former rulers who looted the temple and its hundi, have now come to fruition. The Parakamani videos have surfaced today. Tomorrow, the accused themselves will reveal the full list of YCP’s sins,"" he further said.BJP leader Bhanuprakash Reddy also reshared the video posted by Lokesh.In 2024, the TTD had faced a separate controversy after lab reports found that the ghee used in its laddu prasadam contained adulterated animal fats.","Andhra pradesh’s ruling telugu desam party ( tdp ) leader and mla nara lokesh has alleged that over rs 100 crore was stolen from the tirumala temple.

Surprisingly, leading them is Uttar Pradesh - once clubbed as a prominent member of Bimaru states - with Rs 37,000 crore surplus in the fiscal year 2023. In fact, UP is joined in the elite club by Madhya Pradesh, another member of the erstwhile sick states, with more revenue receipts than expenditu re.UP is followed by Gujarat (Rs 19,865 crore), Odisha (Rs 19,456 crore), Jharkhand (Rs 13,564 crore), Karnataka (Rs 13,496 crore), Chhattisgarh (Rs 8,592 crore), Telangana (Rs 5,944 crore), Uttarakhand (Rs 5,310 crore), Madhya Pradesh (Rs 4,091 crore) and Goa (Rs 2,399 crore).The northeastern states of Arunachal, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura and Sikkim are also among the states on this coveted list. Of the 16 states with revenue surplus, at least 10 are led by BJP.The report, released on Friday by CAG Sanjay Murthy, found that in 2022-23, at least 12 states were in revenue deficit. These included Andhra Pradesh (-Rs 43,488 crore), Tamil Nadu (-Rs 36,215 crore), Rajasthan (-Rs 31,491 crore), West Bengal (-Rs 27,295 crore), Punjab (-Rs 26,045 crore), Haryana (-Rs 17,212 crore), Assam (-Rs 12,072 crore), Bihar (-Rs 11,288 crore), Himachal Pradesh (-Rs 6,336 crore), Kerala (-Rs 9,226 crore), Maharashtra (-Rs 1,936 crore) and Meghalaya (-Rs 44 crore).The composition of revenue deficit states is fast changing with West Bengal, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab joining the league of those surviving on Revenue Deficit Grants from the Centre.West Bengal received the largest share of 16% grants in FY 2023 to bridge the gap between its revenue receipts and expenditure, followed by Kerala 15%, Andhra Pradesh 12%, Himachal Pradesh 11%, and Punjab 10%, CAG said.At the same time, there are states that have boosted their own revenue sources, both tax and non-tax. Haryana tops this list, having the highest own tax and non-tax revenue of over 80% of the state's total revenue. (The other revenue a state receives is through central taxes and grants). Telangana is second with over 79% of its own revenue, followed by Maharashtra 73%, Gujarat 72%, Karnataka 69%, TN 69% and Goa 68%.""In 2022-23, six states: Haryana, Maharashtra, Telangana, Karnataka, Gujarat and TN had States' Own Tax Revenue (SOTR) of more than 60% of their total revenue receipts. Arunachal, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim & Tripura had SOTR of less than 20%,"" CAG noted.The share in Union taxes and grants-in-aid and central assistance, including finance commission grants, constituted 27% and about 17%, respectively, of the states' revenue receipts. States received a total of Rs 1,72,849 crore as finance commission grants, of which Rs 86,201 crore was Revenue Deficit Grants.The own revenue receipts of Karnataka, TN, Goa and Kerala are in the range of 60%-70%; and Andhra, Rajasthan, Punjab and Chhattisgarh between 50% to 60%. The revenue receipts of Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, UP, West Bengal and Uttarakhand are between 40%-50%.""The share of states' own tax and non-tax revenue in revenue receipts of all eight northeastern states, and Bihar and Himachal Pradesh were below 40%,"" CAG said.Among the various streams of states own revenue, a large collection comes from States' Goods and Services Tax (SGST) as well as from VAT and excise duty on alcoholic drinks, petroleum products and electricity (which are outside the GST framework).","Federal auditor cag, in a first of its kind report on state finances, has found that 16 states are revenue surplus.

"Appointed, ignored & unpaid: Meet India's 'invisible' teachers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/appointed-ignored-unpaid-meet-indias-invisible-teachers/articleshow/124033011.cms,"He Was Hired As A Teacher. Now He's Everything From Peon To Entertainer | I Witness

Poll Should teachers in India receive a minimum salary guarantee regardless of their employment status? Yes, every teacher deserves a minimum salary. No, salaries should depend on the institution's funding.

(Reporting by Abdul Qadir in Gaya, BK Mishra in Patna, Saeed Khan and Bharat Yagnik in Ahmedabad, Rahul Singh in Meerut, Isha Jain in Lucknow, & Mohd Dilshad in Agra)

In 1983, Md Aftab Alam was hired as a regular college lecturer — on paper. Forty-one years later, he’s still waiting for his first salary. The appointment letter, issued by Sanjay Gandhi Mahila College in Gaya, promised pay and service conditions on par with university faculty. What followed was four decades of unpaid teaching, no employee ID, no pension — just a man showing up to class every day with a PhD and no payslip. “I taught, I evaluated papers, I invigilated exams,” he said. “But officially, it’s as if I was never there.” His only proof is a fading sheet of paper from 1983 and a lifetime of unacknowledged labour.Last month, in a sharply worded verdict, India's Supreme Court ruled that 18 assistant professors in Gujarat — hired on contract and paid far less than their regular colleagues — had been denied basic constitutional protections. The bench, led by Justice Abhay S Oka, invoked a line familiar to nearly every Indian classroom: “Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshwara.” The words, the court said, mean little if teachers are paid a pittance. Md Aftab Alam and thousands of teachers like him would know.The truth is harder than what the verdict suggests: in places far from Gujarat, and in classrooms that do not appear in affidavits, teachers still work for Rs 3,000 a month.Or Rs 1,000. Or nothing at all.Alam lives in a rented two-room flat in Gaya (Bihar), where the plaster peels and the only reliable light comes from a window that faces the street. Every morning, he folds his PhD certificate back into a drawer, picks up the same well-thumbed books he has taught from for years, and steps out toward a college that never recognised him as its own. His wife, Shamsun Nisa, said the only income now comes from occasional evaluation and invigilation work during university exams. And a little bit of private tuition. Just enough to get by, sometimes with financial help from friends and relatives. “People think he’s too broken to teach. But he still reads. He still steps out in the morning dressed for work.”He began teaching English there in 1983, just after completing his master’s from Magadh University. Though formally hired under university-approved terms, the college denied him regular employee status. “When I asked for a salary,” he said, “they told me I was just a part-time teacher.” Magadh University, in response to an RTI application, confirmed that Alam had indeed been appointed as regular faculty. In July 2023, the state’s higher education director directed the university registrar to take necessary action. Nothing changed. “I couldn’t afford lawyers,” Alam said. “Sometimes I couldn’t afford two meals a day.”India’s education system — vast, decentralised, often romanticised — rests on people like Alam. People who carry attendance registers without knowing whether they’ll be compensated for it. People who prepare lectures, invigilate exams, sign logbooks, evaluate answer sheets, and still have to take private tuition just to afford a sack of rice. Alam is not the only one.The numbers alone tell a story that’s difficult to look away from. There are more than 10,000 teachers in 220 unaided affiliated degree colleges across Bihar. At Banwari College, commerce lecturer Deepak Kumar Singh teaches every day. His salary last year was Rs 9,000. In 2022–23, it was Rs 21,000. Before that, for four consecutive years, he received nothing. “No holidays, no leave. We come, we teach,” he said. “We mark attendance on the biometric machine like everyone else. ” The biometric scanner at the entrance does not care whether its data leads to a pay slip.Others never got even that far. Shankar Bhagat, who taught ancient Indian history in the same college, died of liver cirrhosis without treatment. Another colleague, Mukesh Kumar Mishra, is battling cancer in Muzaffarpur. His salary wasn’t enough to even consider a private hospital. “These are PhD holders,” said Arun Gautam, a senior teacher and media-in-charge of the Federation of Affiliated Degree College Teachers’ Associations of Bihar. “They teach because that’s all they know how to do. But the state hasn’t paid unaided colleges in eight years.”This neglect, over time, has ossified into routine. A 2013 policy promised performance-based grants to unaided institutions — linking funding to student outcomes. But funds were never consistently released. Today, teachers are paid, if at all, from the internal revenues of their colleges: exam fees, certificate charges, hostel deposits. Many have no formal employment letters. Some earn barely Rs 1,500 a month.In Gujarat, the disparities played out on official contracts — but the outcome was no less punishing. Between 2008 and 2014, over 450 engineers were hired as assistant professors on fixed-term contracts. Some were placed in govt engineering colleges, others in polytechnics. They were paid Rs 30,000 or Rs 25,000, and told their tenure would end once Gujarat Public Service Commission filled the sanctioned posts.Naitik Gor was among them. He joined a govt polytechnic institute in 2013. He taught 32 hours a week — nearly double the regular load — and took on the full slate of responsibilities: practicals, examinations, even election duties. “There were no vacations, no earned leave. Same job, same responsibilities, half the pay,” he said. In 2020, he walked away from academia and took a position at a private firm in Ahmedabad. “Teaching was never supposed to feel like charity.”In 2018, more than 300 contractual faculty like him went to Gujarat high court. They argued that the disparity in pay violated Articles 14, 15, 16 and 19 of the Constitution. In 2023, a single-judge bench agreed, calling it a “crying shame” that qualified lecturers, appointed by due process, were still kept on ad hoc contracts. The state appealed. Two division benches rejected its argument. A third overturned the decision. The matter reached Supreme Court.The apex court has now ruled in the petitioners’ favour. Gujarat govt has been ordered to pay arrears with 8% interest from 2015, and to align these teachers with the pay scale of regular assistant professors. But much of the damage is already done. Gor said most of the original petitioners had left teaching. “We waited years for that verdict. When it finally came, only 44 of us were still in the classroom.”The erosion is not just economic — it is emotional, generational, institutional. Siksha Mitras — guest teachers recruited in large numbers in the early 2000s — were briefly regularised in 2015, drawing salaries of Rs 50,000. Two years later, the decision was reversed. Their salaries dropped back to Rs 10,000. “We were promoted, then demoted,” said Meenu Goswami, a Siksha Mitra in Bulandshahr, UP, who lives with a leg disability. “We’ve been doing the same work as govt teachers who earn Rs 65,000 or more. But they said we don’t deserve it.” She recounted at least a dozen suicides among demoted teachers in her district. “Some had loans, others lost homes. The salary cut killed them.”Shaily Sharma spent five years teaching at a small school in Amroha. She holds a postgraduate degree and a BEd. By 2015, she had become principal. Her salary was Rs 4,500 a month. “I loved the work,” she said. “But love doesn’t pay rent.” She left teaching in 2016. She hasn’t returned.Teachers in Lucknow’s top-tier schools — the ones with tall gates and English-medium boards — might earn Rs 60,000 or more. But those are few. Most private school teachers, even at well-known institutions, are paid Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000. “Even the fancy schools don't offer more,” said Atul Srivastava, president of the Association of Private Schools, UP. “Fees are low, CSR support is absent, govt help is negligible. Everyone wants good teachers, but no one wants to pay them.”The longer-term effects are showing across Uttar Pradesh. Since 2021, there has been no recruitment of govt school teachers. Thousands of schools now run entirely on guest faculty. “There’s no pipeline anymore,” said Dinesh Sharma, president of the Uttar Pradesh Primary Teachers’ Association. “People are migrating to other states — Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh. They’ve given up hope here.”The National Education Policy 2020 promised to restore dignity to the teaching profession. It called for better pay, regularisation, and a clear career path. In theory, it still does. In hundreds and thousands of classrooms in the country, though, it's cruel fiction. Ask Aftab Alam, who still walks to the college, notes in hand, and still dresses like a teacher. One with empty pockets and lost youth.","In 1983, md aftab alam was hired as a regular college lecturer — on paper. Forty-one years later, he’s still waiting for his first salary.
