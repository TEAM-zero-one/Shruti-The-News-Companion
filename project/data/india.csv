"In 2023 too, -40 was good enough for NEET PG",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-2023-too-40-was-good-enough-for-neet-pg/articleshow/126663852.cms,"There is much outrage in the medical community that the cut off for NEET PG 2025 has been reduced to zero percentile for the reserved category, which is equivalent to a score of minus 40. However, this is not the first time a score of minus 40 was good enough to qualify. The cut off was similarly reduced to zero percentile in 2023 for all categories and then too the equivalent score was minus 40.In 2023, when the medical counselling committee announced the reduction to zero percentile, it did not reveal that this was equivalent to a score of minus 40. TOI had analysed the NEET scores and pointed out that zero percentile meant 14 candidates who scored zero marks, 13 with negative marks and the one getting the lowest mark of -40 out of 800 would also qualify. In 2025, there are 126 candidates who have scored zero or less. Zero percentile means the lowest score or that none of the candidates got less. In 2023 and in 2025, one candidate got the lowest score of -40.Interestingly, in July 2022, in response to a petition filed by three students seeking lower cut off, the government had stated in court that ""minimum qualifying percentile for admission is required to be maintained to ensure minimum standard of education and general standards for admission to professional courses"".Taking the government's argument into consideration, the court dismissed the petition and ruled against lowering the standards of medical education as it ""involves in its ambit the matter of life and death"".In 2023, govt officials were quoted in news reports justifying lowering the cut off to zero as a one-time measure to fill vacant PG seats. However, this has become a regular feature with cut offs being lowered to abysmal levels every year. About 2 lakh to 2.3 lakh students appear for NEET PG for over 70,000 seats (about 57,000 MD/MS seats and the rest are DNB and PG diploma seats). However, the seats in private medical colleges remain vacant as the fees for clinical subjects in many of them runs into crores which most candidates cannot afford. Lowering the cut off increases the pool of 'qualified' candidates and improves the chance of finding candidates with deep pockets who can afford the fees even if they have rock bottom scores.""To lower NEET PG qualifying marks to abysmal level is driven solely by commercial considerations. This decision 'reserves' post-graduate medical seats to the rich and mighty in commercial fiefdoms called private medical colleges. This is shameful and must be condemned as unadulterated corruption,"" tweeted former principal health secretary of Andhra Pradesh Dr PV Ramesh.","The cut off for neet pg 2025 has been reduced to zero percentile for the reserved category, which is equivalent to a score of minus 40. In 2023 and in 2025, one candidate got the lowest score of -40.

Your vote for BJP will ensure no Sandeshkhali, says Modi

SINGUR: “Maha jungle raj” must end if Bengal is to regain law and order, attract industry and restore investor confidence, PM Narendra Modi said Sunday, launching a blistering attack on Trinamool Congress govt as the state heads towards assembly elections due in about three months.Addressing a rally at Singur — about 40km northwest of Kolkata in Hooghly district — Modi framed the contest as a straight fight between “Trinamool’s maha jungle raj and BJP’s sushasan (good governance)”, accusing Bengal’s governing party of playing with national security by protecting infiltrators for vote-bank politics.“Infiltrators who have settled using forged documents must be identified and sent back,” Modi said, urging voters to replicate Bihar’s verdict against “jungle raj” and end what he called Trinamool’s 15-year misrule.He charged TMC with facilitating infiltration by denying land for fencing along Bangladesh border. “For the past 11 years, Centre has repeatedly written to state govt that a barbed-wire fencing must be erected along Bengal’s border and land is required for it. But TMC has shown no concern,” he said.This story continues on page 9 in the newspaper. For your reading convenience we have added it below.“Your vote for BJP will ensure there is no more Sandeshkhali or theft of jobs,” Modi said.Modi accused Trinamool of blocking central schemes such as Ayushman Bharat, PM Matsya Sampada Yojana and PM Shree Schools, alleging Bengal followed the path of erstwhile Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi govt in stopping benefits.Despite BJP’s pre-rally pitch built around “Tata”, “Nano” and land-for-industry, Modi made no reference to Singur’s past as flashpoint of land acquisition protests that helped Mamata Banerjee end Left Front’s 35-year govt in 2011 and drove Tata’s Nano project to Gujarat. Instead, he linked industry’s return to law and order. “Industry and investment will come to Bengal only when there is proper law and order. If voted to office, BJP will end syndicate tax and rioters,” he said.Earlier, Modi inaugurated and laid foundation stones for port-led development projects worth 830 crore, including an “extended port gate system” at Balagarh, about 60km north of Kolkata along Hooghly river.He said project would ease pressure on Kolkata Port, turn Hooghly into a warehousing and trading hub, draw hundreds of crores in investment and create jobs. “New markets will open for farmers here,” he said, flagging export potential for local produce.Outlining BJP’s economic script, Modi promised district-wise capacity building, a one-district-one-product push, a special plastic policy and immediate encouragement to jute packaging. Hooghly anchors Bengal’s jute belt and hosts nearly 60 mills. Turning to women and youth, Modi invoked social reformer Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, urging them to become agents of change.“Children will not get good education or jobs so long as TMC is in govt,” he said, alleging education sector was under grip of a mafia and Hooghly had been shamed by an education scam. “If voted to office, we will ensure they are behind bars.”Modi credited his govt for Durga Puja in Kolkata securing Unesco’s intangible cultural heritage tag, Santiniketan — about 160km northwest of Kolkata in Birbhum district — gaining world heritage status, classical language recognition for Bengali and installation of Subhas Chandra Bose’s statue at India Gate. “TMC was part of Sonia Gandhi’s govt but made no effort. It happened only after BJP formed govt in Delhi,” he said.","Pm modi says bengal ready to end tmc’s ‘15-year mega-jungleraj’your vote for bjp will ensure no sandeshkhali, says modi.

FIR In July 2023, Suspects Not Even Identified Yet







IMPHAL: A 20-year-old from the Kuki-Zo community, who became the unseen face of mob-fuelled sexual violence during the May 2023 ethnic rioting in Manipur, has died waiting for justice.Eighteen when she was abducted and allegedly ""handed over"" to members of an armed group, the woman carried physical and psychological injuries that never healed, culminating in her death on Jan 10, the Indigenous Tribal Leaders Forum said.The FIR, filed two-and-a-half years ago, is still pending at Porompat police station in Imphal East. None among her alleged attackers has been even identified.Kuki-Zo organisations, including Committee on Tribal Unity, held a candlelight vigil Saturday, demanding accountability for the woman's trauma through the 30-odd months she lived since the assault. She first reported the alleged crime to Kangpokpi police on July 21, 2023, two months after it occurred.This was after she fled the Imphal Valley amid spiralling unrest there. The FIR states that she was abducted on May 15 that year from near an ATM booth in Imphal's New Checkon. Some women from a group involved in the ethnic clashes allowed four armed men belonging to a valley-based outfit to take her to a hilltop, where three of them allegedly took turns sexually brutalising her before dumping her in a creek.The woman survived when an autorickshaw driver ferrying vegetables found her. The next day, she fled Imphal and sought treatment at a Kangpokpi hospital. She was referred to a hospital at Kohima in Nagaland and later to Guwahati in Assam.Despite months of medical care, the woman continued to suffer from uterine complications and deep psychological trauma, ITLF said. The organisation termed her death ""emblematic"" of the atrocities faced by the community during the ethnic violence.The Committee on Tribal Unity urged the Union govt to ensure justice was done to the young woman, saying punishing the perpetrators would ""uphold the spirit of the PM's Beti Bachao vision"".","20-year-old from kuki-zo community became the unseen face of mob-fuelled sexual violence.

"When winter burns: Uttarakhand to Kashmir, Himalayan forests are catching fire out of season",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-winter-burns-uttarakhand-to-kashmir-himalayan-forests-are-catching-fire-out-of-season/articleshow/126661834.cms,"‘Mountains where we’ve lived our lives don’t feel as pleasant anymore’

The pattern extends further north

But does dryness alone explain the scale or spread?

DEHRADUN/KULLU/SRINAGAR: For decades, forest fires in the Himalayas followed a predictable calendar. They started simmering in late spring and early summer, when rising temperatures, dry winds and accumulated leaf litter turned forests combustible. Winter, by contrast, was the season of snow, moisture and relative calm. That rhythm has been breaking for the past few years.This winter, forests across Uttarakhand - and increasingly Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir - have been burning with an intensity and frequency that forest officials and scientists say is no longer an anomaly, but indicative of a shifting ecological pattern. ""Forest fires are part of a natural cycle, but climate variability is compressing and intensifying that cycle,"" said Amit Kumar Verma, senior scientist at Dehradun's Forest Research Institute, who is involved in a five-year study to understand shifting forest fire regimes across the country.Data from Doon-based Forest Survey of India (FSI) shows that since the onset of the winter wildfire season on Nov 1, Uttarakhand has recorded the highest number of fire alerts in the country - 1,756 - surpassing states traditionally more forest fire-prone, such as Maharashtra (1,028), Karnataka (924), Madhya Pradesh (868) and Chhattisgarh (862).While officials emphasise that not every satellite alert translates into an active forest fire, the pattern itself is difficult to dismiss.December, typically a low-fire month, emerged as the most active in the state in nearly three years.Data from Doon-based Forest Survey of India (FSI) shows that since the onset of the winter wildfire season on Nov 1, Uttarakhand has recorded the highest number of fire alerts in the country — 1,756 — surpassing states traditionally more forest fire-prone, such as Maharashtra (1,028), Karnataka (924), Madhya Pradesh (868) and Chhattisgarh (862).While officials emphasise that not every satellite alert translates into an active forest fire, the pattern itself is difficult to dismiss.Dec, typically a low-fire month, emerged as the most active in the state in nearly three years. Forest officials attribute much of the spike to extreme dryness. “We have had a completely rainless December. Moisture levels in forest floors are very low,” a senior official said. Like Uttarakhand, Himachal, too, has not received any rainfall since the first week of October last year, and snowfall has been largely absent from major apple-growing belts such as Kullu, Mandi, Shimla and Chamba. This has led to fires sparking across the state’s forests -- maximum at Shimla forest circle (62), followed by Rampur (16), Mandi (8), the Great Himalayan National Park-Kullu (6), Chamba and Kullu (4 each), and Bilaspur and Wildlife (South) circle (2 each) as per data from the state forest department.Kashmir’s forests have been enduring a harsh, snow-deficient winter too. Fires have been reported across the Valley and the Pir Panjal range, including Uri, Bandipora, Nishat and Poonch. In Dec, a forest guard died while fighting a blaze in south Kashmir’s Anantnag district, and on Jan 12, a forest fire in Poonch triggered a series of landmine explosions along the Line of Control after flames spread into mined areas in Balakote and Mendhar sectors. “There is nearly a 40% snowfall deficit after three consecutive dry winters,” said Mudasir Mehmood, DFO Awantipora. “With no soil moisture, it’s no surprise that grass becomes highly flammable.”Officials point to stubble burning in farms close to forest fringes, biomass and solid waste burning, and in some cases, villagers setting fire to forest floors to encourage fresh grass growth for cattle. Anti-forest activities — including poaching and attempts to flush wildlife from cover — are also cited by forest and wildlife experts as possible reasons.According to former Uttarakhand head of forest force Jairaj, forest fires are rarely driven by a single cause. “In high-altitude areas with valuable wildlife like musk deer, poachers sometimes light fires to corner animals during winter when they are already vulnerable. Climate change adds another layer — everything is dry, and even a small spark can escalate into a big blaze,” he said.What is compounding the situation is that traditional forest management practices have eroded. The gradual decline of grazing and community-led clearing has allowed dry grass and leaf litter to accumulate on the forest floor, creating a potent mix that can erupt into a blaze if a carelessly-thrown beedi or half-lit match comes its way. “Earlier, villagers regularly cleared jungle grass. With migration and alternative livelihoods, that practice is fading,” an official said.On the ground, residents are already feeling the impact. In Jyotirmath (formerly Joshimath), 61-year-old Sarvani Devi has been watching, with a wary eye, smoke spiralling from the forest near her house for the past few days. “If these fires spread, everything will turn to ash. That is our biggest fear. Somehow, these mountains, where we have lived all our lives, don’t feel as pleasant anymore.”","Since the onset of the winter wildfire season on nov 1, uttarakhand has recorded the highest number of fire alerts in the country.

MUMBAI: As Maharashtra heads to elections on Thursday for 29 municipal corporations, all eyes are on Mumbai, where the BJP-led Mahayuti is locked in a battle with the united Thackeray front for control of the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Polling for the 2,869 seats spread across 893 wards will begin at 7.30 am and conclude at 5.30 pm on January 15. A total of 3.48 crore voters are eligible to decide the fate of 15,931 candidates, including 1,700 in Mumbai and 1,166 in Pune. Counting of votes will take place on January 16.More than 25,000 police personnel, including senior officers, will be deployed across Mumbai to oversee elections to the BMC and vote counting. Except for Mumbai, the other 28 urban bodies have multi-member wards.This will be the Shiv Sena’s first BMC election since the 2022 split, when Eknath Shinde broke away with a majority of the party’s legislators, along with its name and symbol. The undivided Shiv Sena had held sway over the country’s richest civic body for 25 years.In a political turn ahead of the elections, estranged cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray reunited after two decades in their bid to consolidate Marathi votes, even as rival NCP factions forged a local alliance in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.In this election, the Opposition Congress has asserted its presence in Mumbai by stepping out of the shadow of its Maha Vikas Aghadi allies — Shiv Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar's NCP (SP). The Congress has joined hands with Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) and the Rashtriya Samaj Paksh in the state capital, even as it contests independently in Nagpur.Elections to 29 municipal corporations are being held after a gap of over six years, with their terms having ended between 2020 and 2023. Of these, nine fall within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the most urbanised belt in India.The battlegrounds include Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Kalyan-Dombivli, Kolhapur, Nagpur, Mumbai, Solapur, Amravati, Akola, Nashik, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Pune, Ulhasnagar, Thane, Chandrapur, Parbhani, Mira-Bhayandar, Nanded-Waghala, Panvel, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Latur, Malegaon, Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad, Jalgaon, Ahilyanagar, Dhule, Jalna, and Ichalkaranji.Chief Minister Fadnavis, along with his deputies Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar, campaigned extensively across Maharashtra, while cousins Uddhav and Raj Thackeray concentrated their efforts on Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, and Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, where Uddhav held a rally. Telangana minister Mohammad Azharuddin, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, and Tamil Nadu BJP leader K Annamalai were also among the star campaigners for the polls.Populist promises for women were the highlight of the manifestos of both the Mahayuti and the Shiv Sena (UBT)-MNS. The Mahayuti has promised a 50 per cent concession for women in BEST bus travel, while the Thackeray cousins have assured a Rs 1,500 monthly allowance for women domestic helps and a property tax waiver on houses up to 700 sq ft. The Congress manifesto, by contrast, prioritises combating Mumbai’s pollution, upgrading the BEST fleet, and strengthening the city’s financial health.The race for Mumbai’s mayoral post took centre stage in the campaign, with the BJP claiming that a Sena (UBT) victory could lead to a Muslim mayor, a charge the Uddhav Thackeray-led party countered by assuring voters of a Marathi mayor. CM Fadnavis also guaranteed that the mayor will be a ""Hindu and Marathi.""In the 227-ward Mumbai, the BJP is contesting 137 seats, the Shiv Sena 90, while the NCP is fighting separately on 94 seats. The Shiv Sena (UBT) has fielded 163 candidates, the MNS 52, the Congress 143 and the VBA 46. The Congress has fielded 1,263 candidates across the rest of the state.The Maharashtra State Election Commission on Friday announced that Thursday, January 15, will be a public holiday in areas falling under the 29 municipal corporations where polling will be held, an official said.The holiday will apply to government and semi-government offices, corporations, boards, public undertakings, banks, and central government offices within the jurisdiction of the civic bodies.The poll comission said administrative preparations, including readiness of EVMs, have been completed and urged the public to take an active part in the democratic exercise.","Elections to 29 municipal corporations are being held after a gap of over six years, with their terms having ended between 2020 and 2023.

It has urged the ministry to withdraw the revised provisions to ongoing projects, claiming that such a move will “impair project cash flow and debt servicing ability”, “trigger lenders concerns” as well as shift financial stress to the banking system.In a separate letter to Sitharaman dated Jan 17, the federation has submitted that the revised dispute framework, in its present form, discourages investment, increases project cost, delays execution and transfers the financial risk to the banking system.“Given the long concession periods, high leverage, dependence on stable cash flows and sensitivity of financing structures, dispute resolution mechanisms for highway projects require sector-specific calibration,” the NHBF said.Separately, NHBF has flagged the issue with bankers and financial lenders, suggesting they assess the impact of ending arbitration on highway loan portfolio with respect to ongoing projects as well as bankability of future projects under the amended model concession agreements of BOT, HAM and EPC.",The national highway builders federation (nhbf) has opposed the road transport ministry’s move to end arbitration in disputes with claims of over rs 10 crore.

‘He Was Screaming For Help’: SUV Plunges Into Flooded Pit, Techie Dies In Noida

NEW DELHI: An FIR has been lodged against two real estate developers after 27-year-old, Yuvraj Mehta, died when his car skidded off the road and plunged into an over 20-feet-deep, water-filled pit in Greater Noida amid dense fog. The victim’s family alleged that repeated requests to install barricades and reflectors at the accident-prone site were ignored, leading to the tragedy.The deceased, Yuvraj Mehta, was a resident of Tata Eureka Park society in Sector 150 and worked as a software engineer with a reputed company in Gurugram. He was returning home from work when the accident occurred in the early hours of Saturday, police said.ACP Hemant Upadhyay told PTI that the FIR has been lodged against the two developers on the basis of the complaint filed by Mehta’s family in connection with the incident.Moninder, a delivery agent and eyewitness, alleged that rescue efforts were delayed and said the techie could have been saved if timely action had been taken.Additional Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Rajeev Narayan Mishra described the incident as unfortunate but denied negligence. He said, ""Police and fire department teams made efforts to save the youth. A fire department crane, ladder, makeshift boat and searchlights were used, but there was zero visibility at that time.""Police earlier said preliminary findings suggested fog and possible overspeeding as factors behind the accident. The body has been sent for post-mortem examination.Mishra added that further investigation is underway. ""Strict action will be taken as per law,"" he said.Local residents staged protests and held a candle march on Sunday evening demanding justice for Mehta. They alleged negligence on the part of the local authority and area developers that led to the tragedy. Following the protest, the Noida Authority installed barricades at the site.","Yuvraj mehta, 27, died when his car skidded off the road and plunged into an over 20-feet-deep, water-filled pit in greater noida amid dense fog.

The woman was waiting at ITI Chowk in Sonipat for an auto-rickshaw when a youth from her village, travelling in a car with two others, stopped and offered her a ride, PTI reported.Police said the accused later stopped at a liquor outlet, purchased alcohol and consumed it inside the vehicle.The car was then driven to a secluded spot, where the men allegedly forced the woman to drink alcohol before raping her.Bahalgarh station house officer Mahesh Kumar said the victim lodged a complaint the same day, following which an FIR was registered under Sections 70(1) (gang rape) and 3(5) (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. One accused has been arrested, while the others, aged between 20 and 25, remain absconding, he said.The case comes weeks after another disturbing incident in Haryana involving a woman who accepted a late-night lift. In early January, a 25-year-old woman was allegedly raped by two men inside a van after being picked up on the Gurgaon–Faridabad Road. She was held captive for nearly three hours, assaulted inside the moving vehicle and later thrown out while it was still in motion, sustaining serious facial injuries that required multiple stitches.In that case, the woman’s family later claimed the vehicle was posing as an ambulance, an allegation police said was under investigation. The accused were detained and an FIR registered under gang rape and other sections of the BNS.","A 19-year-old woman was allegedly gang-raped by three men in haryana’s sonipat district.

NEW DELHI: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Maharashtra civic elections 2026 have marked a decisive shift in the urban political landscape. Held after a delay of nearly four years due to legal challenges and prolonged administrator rule, the elections across 27 municipal corporations and 2,869 seats were widely seen as a test of governance credibility and of existence for some.The verdict was emphatic. The BJP-led Mahayuti alliance emerged as the dominant force in urban Maharashtra, winning 25 of the 29 municipal corporations across the state. In Mumbai, the Mahayuti crossed the majority threshold in the 227-member BMC, with the BJP seizing over 89 wards alone in its favour.With this, there ended the Shiv Sena 's uninterrupted control of the civic body since 1997 and marked the BJP’s first real capture of India’s richest municipal corporation.The biggest and the obvious winner of the civic polls verdict is Devendra Fadnavis and the Bharatiya Janata Party.The BJP has won over 89 wards of the BMC on its own, compared to 82 in 2017. In key wards such as Mulund West (Ward 103), the BJP defeated the MNS by a margin exceeding 12,000 votes.The BJP has emerged as the single largest party in Navi Mumbai with 65 seats, Kalyan-Dombivli (50), Mira-Bhayandar (78), Nashik (72), Panvel (55), Pune (119), Pimpri-Chinchwad (84), Solapur (87), Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar (57), Nanded (45) and Nagpur (102).The saffron party stunned the Pawars in the Pune polls, clinching 119 seats, with Ajit Pawar-led NCP coming in distant second with 27 and its ally NCP (SP) getting three seats, while the Congress managed 15 seats.In the 151-member Nagpur civic body, the BJP held sway, getting 102, while the Congress bagged a mere 34.Nashik saw the BJP bagging 72 seats, Shiv Sena 26, Shiv Sena (UBT) 15, Congress 3 and NCP 4.The BJP's victory streak continued in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, where it won 57 seats, followed by Shiv Sena with 15, Congress with one, while other parties registered with the SEC, especially the AIMIM, bagged 33 seats.With the BMC’s annual budget exceeding Rs 60,000 crore, control over Mumbai’s civic machinery also enhances the BJP’s long-term institutional leverage ahead of the 2029 assembly elections.For the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, the civic results offered political validation.Since the 2022 split, the Shinde faction’s central challenge has been legitimacy. The civic verdict, particularly in Mumbai and Thane, strengthened its claim. The party won 399 wards and emerged as the second largest party in Maharashtra civic polls.In Mira-Bhayandar and Ulhasnagar, the Shinde faction recorded near-sweeps, reflecting voter preference for continuity in infrastructure delivery over symbolic politics.The BJP–Shiv Sena–NCP Mahayuti alliance once again sealed the victory in Maharashtra.Despite contesting separately in some cities, the alliance demonstrated effective vote transferability in Mumbai, Nashik, and Nagpur.The alliance won 1,991 of 2,869 wards across Maharashtra.With a major victory, Mahayuti showed how to converted state-level power into grassroots and civic dominance.The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) made modest but consequential gains in Maharashtra civic elections.It won 33 seats in the Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Municipal Corporation and bagged a total of 126 seats across Maharashtra.The improved tally in Sambhajinagar marked a clear jump from the 2015 municipal corporation elections, when the party had secured 24 seats.AIMIM also registered gains in several urban pockets across the state.The party has won 21 seats in Malegaon, 14 in Nanded Waghala, 12 in Amravati, 10 in Dhule, 8 in Solapur, and eight in Mumbai. It also secured six seats in Nagpur, three in Akola, two each in Ahilyanagar and Jalna, and five seats in Thane.While these numbers remain small, AIMIM’s presence seems to have fragmented the opposition vote, particularly hurting Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT).When the results of the Maharashtra civic elections were being tallied, one of the most unexpected stories to emerge was not about seats won or wards lost. It was about narrative currency — how a Tamil Nadu BJP leader emerged as a winner without contesting.And it all started with the 'rasmalai' controversy which begun when while campaigning in Mumbai for the BMC elections, Annamalai had said the city didn't belong to Maharashtra alone as it was an international city.The remarks triggered a sharp exchange at a joint Shiv Sena (UBT)–MNS rally in Mumbai. MNS chief Raj Thackeray took a swipe at Annamalai, mocking him as 'rasmalai' and questioning his authority to comment on Mumbai. He also raised the slogan “hatao lungi, bajao pungi”, a phrase long used derogatorily against South Indians in the city.However, Mahayuti won and BJP MPs and supporters were soon having a field on social media, posting photos of 'rasmalai' and mocking Raj Thackeray.The biggest electoral setback was suffered by Uddhav Thackeray. From over 130 BMC seats in 2017, Sena (UBT) fell to 65 seats. Even traditional strongholds such as Gorai and parts of Mahim witnessed defeats.The loss of control of the BMC is a big blow to Uddhav the Sena has always maintained its control over the civic body.His long-anticipated reunion with estranged cousin Raj Thackeray also failed to make any impact on the ground.Overall, the party managed to bag only 155 across the state.The Indian National Congress emerged as one of the biggest losers of the BMC and Maharashtra civic elections because the results exposed its near-total erosion in urban politics.In the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Congress, which fought in alliance with Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), bagged 24 seats, a sharp fall from its already diminished presence in 2017, when it had crossed 30. Across Maharashtra’s 27 municipal corporations, the party managed roughly 324 wards out of 2,869.The Congress, which ran a muted campaign in the run-up to the polls, managed significant victories in Bhiwandi, where it won 30 seats, Chandrapur 27, and Latur 43.In Pune, once a Congress-influenced city, the party was restricted to fewer than five seats out of 162, while in Mumbai it failed to emerge as a serious contender in most wards.In Pune, it was reduced to fewer than five seats. The party which decided to go solo after that Thackeray cousins jouned hands, failed to make any impact in BMC polls where Uddhav's Sena won 72 seats.It seems that lack of a city-specific agenda, factional infighting and minimal national leadership presence during the campaign compounded the decline.For Raj Thackeray, the civic polls reinforced a long-term downward trajectory.The leader joined hands with his cousin Uddhav to keep the BJP at bay. But the results show how he failed miserably.During the election campaign, he tried to appeal around the idea of the 'Marathi Manoos' while invoking Balasaheb Thackeray. This politics of sentiment obviously has deep roots in Maharashtra’s history.He relied on fiery speeches, symbolic gestures and cultural flashpoints to command attention, often targeting migrants, linguistic outsiders, or perceived cultural dilution in Mumbai. Unlike mass welfare or governance-driven politics, his appeal was rooted in 'Marathi asmita'.This, however, failed to resonate with the voters. The MNS failed to secure major wins, while getting only 6 of 227 wards in Mumbai.At the state level, the party managed to get only 13 of 2869 wards.Sharad Pawar emerged as one of the biggest losers of the BMC and Maharashtra civic elections as the results exposed the steady erosion of his once-formidable grip over urban and organisational politics.For decades, Pawar was seen as the master strategist of Maharashtra, capable of shaping outcomes even when not in direct power. The civic verdict punctured that perception. The NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) failed to make any meaningful impact in the BMC, getting just 1 win in Mumbai wards and remaining marginal in Pune, a city long considered central to Pawar’s political influence.His strategy to join hands with nephew Ajit Pawar for the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal elections also failed as the BJP secured victory in these bodies.Statewide, the faction’s ward tally was 36 of 2869 wards, far below expectations for a party led by a veteran of his stature.Crucially, Pawar’s traditional role as an alliance-builder also lost relevance. Fragmentation within the opposition and the rise of a dominant Mahayuti alliance reduced his ability to act as a power broker. This time, though reports suggested he wanted the Maha Vikas Agadi to fight as a unit, he failed to keep the parties together, especially after the Thackeray cousins joined hands, pushing Congress to go solo.Despite being part of Mahayuti, Ajit Pawar has emerged as one of the losers this election. During the civic poll campaigns, Ajit Pawar repeatedly hit out at his own Mahayuti allies, Eknath Shinde and Devendra Fadnavis, exposing visible faultlines within the ruling alliance.As election date approached, he finally decided to unite with his uncle Sharad Pawar to contest Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad elections as a united front.His attacks were also unusually sharp for an alliance partner, with Pawar questioning why local bodies under BJP–Shinde control still struggled with water supply, roads and urban planning. In several rallies, he projected his faction as a corrective force within the government rather than a stakeholder in its record. .The civic results however suggest the tactic backfired. Ajit Pawar’s faction underperformed in Pune and Nashik, reinforcing the perception that public sparring with allies during elections diluted his credibility and bargaining power within the Mahayuti rather than strengthening it.Eventually, the Pawar lost their strongholds, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, to BJP with huge margin.",Mumbai and pune verdict shake thackeray and pawar dynasties as legacy politics faces reality check. Here are the top 10 winners and losers of maharashtra civic poll elections 2026. The bjp–shiv sena–ncp mahayuti alliance once again sealed the victory in maharashtra.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126574048,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1406256,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Mamata Banerjee Hits Streets, Leads Kolkata Rally Against ED Raids

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress (TMC) national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee on Sunday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of blocking central funds meant for West Bengal. His remarks came on a day when the prime minister addressed a rally in the poll-bound state, urging voters to end the TMC’s 15-year “maha jungle-raj. ”“You blocked funds meant for the people of Bengal and harassed them. You inflicted miseries on the people of Bengal over the last five years, and so your party will be reduced to below 50 seats in the assembly polls,” Banerjee said while addressing a rally in West Bengal’s Nadia district.His aunt, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee—who also heads the TMC—has repeatedly accused the BJP-led Union government of withholding central funds for the state and has made the issue a key poll plank.The Diamond Harbour MP further asserted that the fall of the BJP-led government at the Centre would begin in West Bengal.“In the coming days, the people of Bengal will throw you out of power in Delhi after electing the TMC for the fourth time. ‘Poriborton habe’ (there will be change at the Centre),” he remarked.On the recent Enforcement Directorate raids at the Kolkata office of I-PAC—a leading political consultancy that has been working with the TMC since 2021—Banerjee accused the Centre of “misusing” central agencies against opposition-run states.“They tried to steal our data before the elections, but we have people’s support. They (the BJP ) have everything—from the ED and CBI to a section of the media. They put central agencies behind me before the 2021 elections but failed. Now they are resorting to falsehood,” he stated.Referring to the ongoing revision of electoral rolls, Banerjee claimed that despite allegations of large numbers of illegal immigrants, the exercise had identified 54 lakh “unmapped voters"" in the state.“Now, unhappy with the findings, they are planning to delete over one crore names from the electoral rolls. We will not allow this to happen,” he alleged.Buoyed by its success in the recent assembly elections in neighbouring Bihar, the BJP is eyeing its first stint in power in West Bengal, where the TMC, under Mamata Banerjee, has been in office since 2011.","Abhishek banerjee accused prime minister narendra modi of blocking central funds meant for west bengal.
