City 'love crime victim' was actually lone witness in a murder case: Cops,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/city-love-crime-victim-was-actually-lone-witness-in-a-murder-case-cops/articleshow/120501637.cms,"Committed crime to 'prove himself', says hired killer

NEW DELHI: What had initially appeared to be a case of a 'spurned lover's rage' turned out to be a calculated murder-for-hire plot . Twenty-year-old Sayra Parveen was shot dead on April 14 in east Delhi's GTB Enclave, not over jealousy as her 'boyfriend' Rizwan (20) first claimed when he was arrested, but because she was a key witness in a murder case, say cops. Delhi Police has now arrested two more men who allegedly masterminded the conspiracy to silence her. The accused were identified as Kishan Kumar (39) and Firoj Khan alias Aman (22).The case came to light on April 14 when Parveen was found murdered. She had gone to meet Rizwan, whom she befriended through social media. Police nabbed Rizwan from Karnal in Haryana based on CCTV footage that showed the duo together before the murder.DCP (Shahdara) Prashant Priya Gautam stated that Rizwan initially misled investigators by claiming he killed Parveen out of jealousy, alleging she was with someone else. However, during sustained interrogation, Rizwan confessed that he was actually hired by Kishan and Firoj to kill Parveen.The inquiry revealed that Parveen was a key witness in the murder case of Rahul, which occurred four months ago. ""The incident took place when Parveen was harassed and assaulted by a group of local boys in Nand Nagri. Rahul, who was passing by, intervened to help her. The confrontation turned violent and ended in Rahul's killing. Parveen was made a witness in the murder case,"" police said.According to a police source, Kishan, Rahul's uncle, and Firoj, a friend of the deceased, harboured resentment towards Parveen. They blamed her for Rahul's death, believing that if she wasn't involved in the altercation, Rahul wouldn't have intervened and been killed. Additionally, they feared that Parveen's friendship with some of the suspects would weaken the case, as she might turn hostile in court. This led them to plan her killing.The accused hired Rizwan to befriend Parveen through social media. They met twice. On April 14, Rizwan found the opportunity and executed the plan.The duo paid Rizwan Rs 15,000 and gave him a pistol to kill Parveen, promising Rs 1 lakh more. Rizwan, 'aspiring to be a gangster', confessed to the crime to prove himself. Kishan and Firoj were arrested. The weapon used in the crime and cash were recovered, along with mobile phones.","Sayra parveen, 20, was shot dead on april 14 in east delhi's gtb enclave.

A career cut short by family tragedy

NEW DELHI: In a shocking twist to the death of former Karnataka DGP Om Prakash, Bengaluru Police have detained his wife, Pallavi, after she allegedly threw chilli powder in his face and stabbed him to death in their HSR Layout residence.Their daughter, Kriti, has also been detained for questioning as investigators dig deeper into what appears to be a domestic dispute turned deadly.The development comes following a formal complaint filed by the deceased officer’s son, who alleged that both women had a role in the killing.According to police sources, the 68-year-old retired IPS officer was killed following a heated argument with Pallavi, who reportedly lost control and attacked him with a knife after blinding him with chilli powder, reported PTI.The murder is said to have occurred on the ground floor of their three-storeyed home on Sunday, where Prakash was found lying in a pool of blood.What makes the case more chilling is what followed: PTI sources say Pallavi made a video call to a friend immediately after the incident and declared, “I have killed the monster.”Prakash's son Kartikesh has come forward with a damning accusation that his mother Pallavi had been threatening to kill his father for a week, and that his sister Kriti pressured him to return home just two days before his death.“Due to these threats, my father had gone to stay at his sister’s house,” Kartikesh said in his police complaint. “My younger sister Kriti went there and brought him back against his will.”According to the complaint, the fatal incident came to light around 5 pm on Sunday when a neighbor alerted Kartikesh while he was at the Karnataka Golf Association. “I rushed home and found police and others already there. My father was lying in a pool of blood with injuries on his head and body. A broken bottle and a knife were found near his body,” he said, adding that his father was taken to St John’s Hospital.“My mother Pallavi and sister Kriti used to fight with my father often.

The association moved SC and challenged the appointment on grounds that Pandit was ineligible to be appointed to the post on deputation for five years and his appointment stood vitiated on account of an arbitrary selection process that was initiated without issuing any open advertisement as per mandate of the law.",The petition filed by around 600 group-a patent officers is virtually a revolt by them against the centre's decision to pandit's appointment.

"After 9 months of wait, India’s 1st Aadhaar recipient gets Ladki dues",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-9-months-of-wait-indias-1st-aadhaar-recipient-gets-ladki-dues/articleshow/120501511.cms,"‘I will use Ladki dues of 9 months to pay son’s fees & for other expenses’

Pune: Ranjana Sonawane ’s happiness knew no bounds on Monday when she received a demand draft for Rs 13,500 as a Mukhyamantri Mazhi Ladki Bahin Yojana beneficiary after Nandurbar’s collector Mitali Sethi intervened.Ranjana from Tembhli village in Shahada tehsil of Nandurbar district in Maharashtra was the first recepient of Aadhaar in 2010. But she was deprived of the Ladki Bahin benefits as her card was linked to someone else’s bank account in Mumbai where the monthly welfare benefit was deposited for the last nine months.A TOI report on April 18 highlighted Ranjana’s plight where she made futile efforts to rectify the error.After receiving the demand draft, Ranjana told TOI, “I waited for so long and made several rounds of govt offices and banks for the benefits. The administration acted promptly after the media report. I will use the amount for my son’s college fees, and other family expenses,” she said.Sethi, who had told TOI that she would look into Ranjana’s case, coordinated with the bank’s officials in Mumbai for delinking the fraudulent account.She said: “We initiated the recovery process from the account where her benefits were being transferred. The bank gave us a demand draft on Monday. It was handed over to Ranjana by Shahada tehsildar Deepak Girase.”Sethi also supervised the opening of a new post office savings account for Ranjana on Saturday for the Ladki Bahin benefits transfer.Girase said, “We have handed over the DD to the recipient and will check for any more fraudulent accounts like hers.”The bank will complete its investigation into the account where Ranjana’s Ladki Bahin amount of Rs 1,500 was being transferred since July 2024 when the Mahayuti govt in Maharashtra launched it before the Nov 2024 assembly election.Vivek Walvi, Nandurbar district’s women and child development officer, said, “We ensured that Ranjana got the entire amount from July. Her new account in the post office has been linked to her Aadhaar and the April amount will flow to this account.”Both Girase and Walvi will also check the entire list of beneficiaries and monitor others’ complaints.Sethi said Rajana’s case may not be the only one among the state’s 2.5 crore Ladki Bahin beneficiaries. She has set up a dedicated helpline for Nandurbar district to assist others facing similar issues. Complaints can be registered on the state grievance redressal portal or on 02564210047.The collector said she will look into Rajana’s gas subsidy too which has the same Aadhaar linked problem. “An investigation will be carried out into how such fraudulent accounts are created, and action will be taken against those involved,” she added.",‘i will use ladki dues of 9 months to pay son’s fees & for other expenses’ ranjana sonawane was the first recepient of aadhaar in 2010.

In many cases, they couldn't get it in time leading to complications and even death.While the intensity of the drug crisis may have waned with the end of the pandemic, doctors say, the struggle to manage fungal infections continues due to the scarcity of antifungal drugs and growing resistance against the existing ones.A first-of-its-kind report released by the World Health Organisation (WHO) warns that if steps are not taken to increase the pool of antifungal medications soon, the shortage may lead to a public health crisis .""Invasive fungal infections threaten the lives of the most vulnerable, but countries lack the treatments needed to save lives,"" said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Antimicrobial Resistance ad interim.He said, ""Not only is the pipeline of new antifungal drugs and diagnostics insufficient, but there is also a void in fungal testing in low- and middle-income countries, even in district hospitals. This diagnostic gap means the cause of people's suffering remains unknown, making it difficult to get them right treatments.""Dr Rajesh Chawla, a critical care specialist at Delhi's Indraprastha Apollo hospital said even now they keep getting patients with serious fungal infections and it is becoming increasingly difficult to manage them because in many cases the fungi causing the infection are found to be resistant to existing drugs.","A first-of-its-kind report released by the world health organisation (who) warns that if steps are not taken to increase the pool of antifungal medications soon, the shortage may lead to a public health crisis.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120501445,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-54992,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

The notice states, “It is hereby notified for the information of all concerned that the following matters, previously listed before the division bench comprising Justice Yashwant Varma and Justice Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar, in which a next hearing date was assigned but no orders were drawn, shall be re-listed and heard afresh.”Justice Varma was transferred from Delhi HC to Allahabad HC following an ongoing in-house probe into allegations that a semi-burnt pile of cash was discovered at his residence last month. A majority of the 52 cases that will now be heard afresh by a new bench relate to tax matters, including GST-related disputes.Recently, his swearing-in was conducted privately instead of at the customary public ceremony after the bar bodies of Allahabad opposed his transfer. Before his transfer, Justice Varma served at Delhi HC where his tenure was marked by handling key cases across constitutional and corporate law.His name became embroiled in controversy after a substantial amount of cash was allegedly discovered at his residence during a fire on March 14. The Supreme Court conducted a preliminary inquiry into the matter and published a report, but due to the sensitivity of the case, it kept the findings redacted, restricting public and parliamentary access. SC has also constituted an in-house panel comprising three sitting judges to inquire into the matter before further action.","Delhi high court has issued a public notice informing that fresh hearings will be conducted in 52 pending cases.

Respecting the judiciary shouldn’t be contingent upon the favourability of its decisions. Selective approbation erodes public trust and the foundational principles of our democracy,” Sarma posted on X, amid a row over Dubey’s remarks on the SC and the CJI Sanjiv Khanna.Sarma said the impeachment motion against Justice Misra was initiated by Congress and other opposition parties while alleging “misconduct without substantial evidence”. “Justice Ranjan Gogoi: Subjected to severe criticism following landmark judgments, including the Ayodhya verdict,” Sarma said, adding that Justice Arun Mishra was allegedly “targeted” for his decisions and alleged proximity to the executive.",Assam cm himanta biswa sarma reaffirmed bjp’s commitment to upholding the independence and dignity of india's judiciary.
