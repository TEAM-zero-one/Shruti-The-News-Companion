"Highway projects of 4L cr delayed, 200 bid out, await start",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/highway-projects-of-4l-cr-delayed-200-bid-out-await-start/articleshow/123128712.cms,"NEW DELHI: : Around 580 National Highway (NH) projects with total cost of nearly Rs 3.9 lakh crore are delayed and another 200 projects worth Rs 1.6 lakh crore are yet to take off months after they were bid out.Delay in land acquisition, issues relating to contractors and pending statutory clearances have been identified as main reasons that have held up these projects, sources said.However, the road transport and highways ministry has been able to reduce the number of projects, which are delayed by more than three years, by almost 50% in the past one-and-a-half years - from 152 in April 2024 to 81 in July 2025 - through greater focus on regular monitoring to resolve all pending issues. Officials said even the number of all delayed projects has been reduced by around 16% in first four months of the current financial year due to stricter and regular monitoring.""The target is to reduce the number of delayed projects significantly as these cause cost escalation and deprive people of the desired benefit,"" said an official.TOI has learnt that there is a monthly meeting of all highway building agencies to expedite project execution.Among the major factors impacting the projects, land acquisition is the leading one (28% of cases), followed by issues relating to contractors (19%) and forest clearances (13%). Officials said there is special thrust on completing projects where small works are pending to reduce overall number of delayed projects significantly.Data show while total number of delayed NH projects stood at 690 in April 2024, it went down to 686 in April 2025 and to around 580 by July-end. Over 50% of projects are delayed by up to six months, while more than one-third are delayed by 1-3 years.Officials said the factors delaying project execution also impact new works being bid out. For example, the highway agencies are yet to bid out 276 sanctioned projects worth Rs 1.4 lakh crore. As per the new norm, bids cannot be opened for a project unless the highway building agency has at least 80% of the required land in its possession.","Delay in land acquisition, issues relating to contractors and pending statutory clearances have been identified as main reasons that have held up these projects.

DEHRADUN: A man narrowly escaped death after the flash flood swept through Dharali village in Uttarkashi on Tuesday, triggering a massive pile of debris.He was seen crawling out from the rubble, covered in mud and visibly injured, moments after the deadly waters destroyed homes, shops and roads in seconds.The man's identity and his current condition remained unknown as of Tuesday evening, but widely circulated videos have already hailed him as a hero.Officials have not yet confirmed whether he was later taken to hospital or rescued by disaster response teams.The video captured by a local resident from an elevated area showed the moment a sudden torrent of water, mud, and rocks came crashing down from the hills over the Kheer Gad stream.The flood's strong current flattened everything in its path.

"Uttarkashi mayhem: In Dharali, the calendar is written in floods; here, clock ticks to the roar of Kheer Gad",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/uttarakhand-flash-flood-dharali-mountain-village-that-marks-calendar-by-number-of-times-it-sinks-river-arrives-unannounced-and-dragging-centuries-of-stone/articleshow/123130541.cms,"



DEHRADUN: In Dharali, disaster isn't the exception. It's the architecture. And each time the Kheer Gad river roars to life, villagers climb to the roof and wait - not for rescue, but to see what's left standing when the river leaves.The river doesn't knock before entering the hamlet near Gangotri on the old Indo-Tibetan Silk route. It doesn't announce itself with thunder or rain, just arrives - sudden, swollen, dragging centuries of stone behind it.In this village tucked into a crease of Uttarkashi, flood isn't a headline. It's a season in the calendar. Locals mark the years not by festivals or elections, but by the floods: the one in 2010 that soaked the school walls, the one in 2012 that swallowed a shop, another in 2018 that buried apple orchards under boulders taller than men. The Kheer Gad, a seemingly harmless trickle for most of the year, turns violent when cloudbursts hit Srikanth Parvat. And when it does, it doesn't rise - it lunges.Despite the frequency and intensity of these disasters, Dharali had been extraordinarily fortunate so far: in all recorded incidents between 2010 and 2018, no lives were lost. The river took homes, orchards, roads, and livelihoods - but never a person.Dharali, with a population just over 500, sits along the Char Dham yatra route, 20km before the Gangotri shrine.In summer, its guesthouses and dhabas are packed with pilgrims and tourists, more than doubling the population; by mid-July, the rains begin and the village watches the stream. The 2018 flood - the worst before Tuesday's - came in the early hours, leaving behind silence and the smell of wet iron. Nearly two dozen homes and hotels were reduced to rubble, two hectares of apple orchards disappeared under muck, and the road to the shrine was choked with silt and broken tin roofs.Lokendra Bisht, an Uttarkashi resident, remembers 2018 clearly. ""We dug out furniture from mud two days later,"" he told TOI. ""That time, no one died. But the loss - of homes, of work - it stayed with us longer than the flood."" He remembered 2012 the same way: quieter, but damaging. The Kheer Gad had risen again, this time pushing through homes and shops without warning.The pattern has grown hard to ignore. Over those years, the Kheer Gad behaved less like a stream and more like a fuse - short, volatile, and primed to detonate without warning. And each year, the debris has crept closer to the village centre. The stream begins on Srikanth Parvat and empties into the Bhagirathi river just downstream. The short run belies its power. When it floods, Dharali becomes a basin.Before the recent floods etched Dharali into disaster maps, destruction had already marked the valleys around it. In 1978, a dam breach near Dabrani, roughly 35km downstream, sent a rush of water through villages along the Bhagirathi. In 1984, a cloudburst over the Gyansu nala - just 15km from Dharali - triggered a flood that turned fields into silt flats overnight. And in 2003, a section of Varunavat mountain peeled off above Uttarkashi town, 40km away, burying homes and snapping roads. Dharali was spared each time, but the events traced a ring around it - as if the landscape had been circling the village, waiting.And the pushing hasn't stopped. A 2013 report by the Uttarakhand Disaster Mitigation and Management Centre classified Dharali and nearby villages like Sukhi and Jhala as high-risk zones. The warnings were clear, but so were the incentives to ignore them. Hotels continued to rise on riverbeds. Pilgrim traffic swelled. Roads were widened. Slopes were cut.Experts who have studied the region's topography have dire warnings. With glacial melt accelerating and rainfall patterns shifting, cloudbursts are now more frequent, and the consequences more immediate. ""People think the mountain breaks in one night,"" a geologist from the Wadia Institute once said. ""But in reality, it's been breaking slowly for years.""","Dharali, with a population just over 500, sits along the char dham yatra route, 20km before the gangotri shrine.

It was hit by a devastating flash flood following a cloudburst in the Kheer Ganga river catchment area.“Bhaag bhai bhaag, arre bhaag bhaag!” people screamed from a distance, as a man frantically tried to wade through the thick sludge and gushing water, mere moments after a powerful flash flood flattened Uttarakhand’s Dharali village. Surrounded by the shattered remains of homes and uprooted trees, he carefully made his way through the wreckage.Another chilling video from the scene showed residents screaming and fleeing as torrents of water ripped through the hillside village. The footage captured the chaos and fear as the surging floodwaters swept away structures and debris, leaving a trail of devastation in their wake.The TOI couldn't independently verify the video.Another visual showed the Jyotirmath-Malari motor road, which has been completely washed away near Saldhar, cutting off access to several remote areas.The damage severely impacted connectivity, posing challenges for rescue operations and the movement of essential supplies.Landslides have blocked 163 roads across the state, including five national highways, seven state highways, and two border routes, severely disrupting rescue efforts and cutting off access to the remote area, located about 140 km from Dehradun and typically a five-hour drive away.Another footage showed a village submerged by the flash floods. According to state disaster management secretary Vinod Kumar Suman, the raging waters split into two streams, surging down opposite sides of the same hill, one toward Dharali and the other toward Sukki village.Cloudbursts are among the most destructive natural disasters in the Himalayas, bringing intense rainfall over small areas in a short time. Defined by the IMD as rainfall exceeding 100 mm per hour with strong winds and lightning across 20–30 sq km, cloudbursts are part of a broader pattern of extreme weather events in the region.These events, including flash floods and avalanches, are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change.","Multiple cloudbursts triggered flash floods across several uttarakhand regions on tuesday.

'Kaan Khol Ke Sun Lo...': Mamata Threatens EC, BJP Over Bengali Harassment, Voter Roll ‘Conspiracy’

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday suspended four officials posted in West Bengal for allegedly sharing login credentials of their elector roll (ER) database with ""unauthorised persons"".Taking note of the grave lapses committed by the officers, the poll body said that action came after Bengal's chief electoral officer informed the ECI ""about the wrongful addition of names in the electoral rolls by the four officers"" in Baruipur Purba.The four officials suspended were posted in the capacity of the electoral registration officer (ERO) and assistant electoral registration officer (AERO), who are responsible for the preparation, revision and correction of the electoral rolls.The Election Commission said that suitable disciplinary proceedings will be initiated against Debottam Dutta Choudhury (ERO), Tathagata Mondal (AERO), Biplab Sarkar (ERO) and Sudipta Das (AERO), adding that FIRs will be lodged against them ""for their actions, which potentially amount to criminal misconduct"".The poll body said that FIR will also be lodged against the casual data entry operator Surojit Halder.A few days ago, the ECI gave the nod to FIRs against two electoral registration officers (EROs) in Bengal for anomalies in the voters' list.The two officers shared their passwords with data entry operators, which allowed the latter to feed 102 bogus voters' data into the EC portal.TOI reported that the EROs of Nandakumar in East Midnapore and Rajarhat-Gopalpur in North 24 Parganas were questioned by EC and were under scrutiny for failing to give a satisfactory reply to the commission.The office of the chief electoral officer sent a report to the EC, indicating that names of non-existent voters were entered directly by data entry operators by using the passwords of the two EROs. The two EROs have admitted to sharing the passwords.In this case, it was found that even booth level officers (BLOs) were not sent to verify the names. The lack of physical verification allowed the electoral rolls to be inflated with bogus voters, sources said. The district electoral officers were then asked to probe the malpractices.","The election commission of india (eci) on tuesday suspended four officials posted in west bengal.

They confirmed a massive mudslide in Dharali village at 1.45pm on Tuesday, which caused a sudden rush of water and debris through the settlement.","The cloudburst took place in the catchment area of the kheer ganga river near harsil in uttarkashi. Several houses, along with 20–25 hotels and homestays, have reportedly been swept away.

Poll Do you think social media plays a significant role in raising awareness about animal cruelty? Yes, absolutely Not really

A disturbing case of animal cruelty has emerged from Navi Mumbai's Kopar Khairane residential area, where a 16-year-old stray dog, roughly equivalent in age to an 80-year-old human was brutally assaulted by a man using a heavy wooden plank. The helpless dog was left injured and visibly shaken until a team of animal rescuers arrived and intervened.The video of the incident was originally shared on Instagram by one of the rescuers, Mohammed Raiz. In it, the young man can be seen repeatedly striking the defenseless animal with a thick stick of plywood. The footage quickly went viral, sparking widespread outrage across social media platforms.In his post, Raiz wrote: ""Hats off to PFA’s brave warriors for standing up for the voiceless!""The rescue operation was carried out by the People for Animals (PFA) Mumbai Unit 2, led by Vijay Rangare. The team comprising Mohammed Raiz, Aditya, Tarun and Sanket Bhatt acted swiftly, tracked down the accused and confronted him directly. Due to their quick response, the dog was rescued and is now safe.n a follow-up post, Raiz also revealed that the accused’s mother had allegedly provoked her son to commit the act. Shockingly, she reportedly justified the cruelty and even claimed they would repeat it if necessary.The video has garnered over 77.9K views on social media. Reactions have been overwhelmingly critical of the attack.Reacting to the video one user commented, “Please give him the same treatment he gave to the poor dog.” “So much he beat the dog… please tell me, is the dog okay?” commented another concerned netizen.The situation escalated further when a crowd confronted the man in public. He was thrashed by locals, including a woman who beat him with her slippers in the middle of the road, shaming him for attacking an innocent animal.Giving an update about the condition of dog, the official page of Street Dogs of Bombay posted: ""The senior dog who was badly beaten is now safe. He’s getting better, thanks to Dr. Kartik Iyer and his kind team. They are giving him all the care, love, and attention he needs. We’re hopeful he will soon go back to his usual spot at his little home on the street.""","A 16-year-old stray dog was brutally assaulted by a man using a heavy wooden plank.

NEW DELHI: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) will not extend invitations to the embassies of Pakistan, Turkey and Bangladesh for its 100th anniversary celebrations, though it is reaching out to other diplomatic missions it has been in touch with. The list of invitees also includes representatives of minority communities, sports and cultural icons, thought leaders, and entrepreneurs from emerging fields such as Indian knowledge systems and start-ups.The highlight of the centenary year will be a three-day dialogue in Delhi from August 26, led by Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat, focusing on the Sangh’s century-long journey, its role in nation-building and its vision for “new horizons.”Bhagwat’s Delhi address will be part of a series of four major events in the run-up to the Vijayadashami centenary on October 2. Similar dialogues are scheduled in Bengaluru in November, Kolkata thereafter, and Mumbai. Each will feature two days of lectures by Bhagwat and a third day devoted to a pre-submitted question-and-answer session.

But all four corporations decided to go ahead with the protest.The strike is being held over demands including the release of 38 months of unpaid salaries, implementation of wage revision from January 1, 2024, opposition to privatisation, end to worker harassment, and a demand that company drivers be assigned to electric buses as well.Talks between the government and transport unions had failed before the strike.The high court had issued an interim stay on the strike on Monday, saying that a complete halt of public transport would cause hardship to the public. However, the unions have decided to go ahead with their protest.Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah had urged the workers to cancel the strike. However, union leaders said the government’s offer to clear only two years of arrears was not acceptable and that there was no clear assurance on salary revision.KSRTC Staff and Workers' Federation president H V Anantha Subbarao said, as quoted by PTI, ""We are not satisfied. We want full 38 months' arrears.""","Buses stopped running from 6.00 am after workers of bengaluru metropolitan transport corporation (bmtc), karnataka state road transport corp ( ksrtc), and kalyana karnataka road transport corporation went on strike.

Panchmiya shared the details of the incident in a post on X, describing it as the most difficult 48 hours of his travel experience.“We had just landed in Barcelona after a heavy week at ETHCC Cannes. It was a chill morning for us,” he wrote. Panchmiya said he stepped outside for a call, leaving his small black bag under the table. “Something I’d done a hundred times on trips like these.” When he returned, the bag was gone.The missing items included his passport, US visa, credit cards, and a large amount of cash. He approached Starbucks staff to check the CCTV footage but was told the police would need to be involved first. “I ran to the Starbucks staff, begged them to show me the CCTV. They couldn’t, said the police had to get involved first,” he said.At the police station, Panchmiya was informed that reviewing the footage would take time. “Police said: ‘It’ll take 15 to 20 days for us to even review the CCTV footage,’” he wrote. With his return flight to India scheduled for Monday and the Indian embassy closed for the weekend, he waited until Monday to seek help.“I walked in as soon as they opened. And I cannot thank them enough, they issued me an emergency certificate (a temporary passport) in just 4 to 5 hours. That same evening, I was back on a flight to India,” he wrote.Now back in India, Panchmiya is reapplying for his passport and visas. He said he shared the experience to inform others who may find themselves in a similar situation while travelling.“If you travel often, especially around Europe, this can happen to anyone. Even if you’re cautious. Even if you’re ‘experienced,’” he wrote.Offering guidance, Panchmiya said, “Don’t panic. Immediately go to the nearest police station. File a report. Walk into your embassy in person. Don’t just email or call. Explain everything clearly.” He added, “Ask for an emergency certificate. If your flight is close, they can issue one in hours.”Reflecting on the situation, he noted, “I’ve never had my passport stolen before. But now I’ve seen firsthand how quickly things can flip. And also, how supportive the Indian embassy and the Web3 community around me can be in tough times.”He concluded the post by stating that he is now safe at home and shared the story in the hope that it helps others navigate a similar situation.","Ayush panchmiya lost his passport, us visa, credit cards, and cash while in barcelona, spain.

It also directed that an FIR be filed against them for ""criminal misconduct"".In a letter sent to the West Bengal chief secretary on Tuesday, the poll panel said it has ""taken serious note of the grave lapses and has decided the officers shall be placed under suspension for their failure in supervising the election related work... and suitable disciplinary proceedings initiated against them without any delay"".The action against West Bengal civil service officers and EROs of Baruipur Purba AC and Moyna AC, Debottam Dutta Choudhury and Biplab Sarkar, respectively, and assistant EROs Tathagat Mondal and Sudipta Das, came after the state chief electoral officer (CEO) reported that they had been disposing of applications for inclusion in the electoral roll without proper verification or allowing a window for claims and objections. They also violated the policy of data security by sharing their login credentials for the electoral roll database with unauthorised persons.

Glacier collapse or lake burst likely caused Dharali destruction: Experts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/glacier-collapse-or-lake-burst-likely-caused-dharali-destruction-experts/articleshow/123127901.cms,"DEHRADUN: A glacier collapse or glacial lake breach upstream, rather than the initially suspected cloudburst, likely triggered the flash flood that ravaged Dharali village in Uttarkashi district on Tuesday, experts studying meteorological and satellite data told TOI. As rescue and relief operations continued, scientists began investigating evidence suggesting that a significant avalanche, glacier collapse or lake burst upstream may have unleashed the destructive torrent.IMD recorded minimal rainfall around the time of the disaster, raising questions about the cloudburst theory. Harsil had only 6.5mm rain on Tuesday, and cumulative rainfall over 24 hours was just 9mm in Harsil and 11mm in Bhatwari - figures significantly below levels typically associated with cloudburst-induced flooding.Rohit Thapliyal, senior scientist at IMD's regional meteorological centre, said, ""Only very light to light rain was observed in the affected area over 24 hours. The highest rainfall recorded anywhere in Uttarkashi was merely 27mm at the district headquarters."" Another senior scientist added, ""This volume is insufficient to trigger floods of such severity, suggesting a powerful event such as a glacier burst or a GLOF.Satellite images independently accessed by TOI confirmed the presence of significant glaciers and at least two glacial lakes situated directly above the affected site. ""There is a glacier right above Kheer Gad stream; a sudden release of water, either from glacial lake outburst or glacier burst, could lead to a high-energy flash flood, similar to the Raini disaster in Chamoli in Feb 2021,"" said the scientist. The Raini incident involved a rock-ice avalanche that triggered floods devastating the Rishiganga hydel project and severely damaging the Tapovan-Vishnugad power plant, resulting in more than 200 deaths.According to Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, Uttarakhand has 1,266 glacial lakes ranging from small bodies to large reservoirs, several of which pose significant downstream threats. National Disaster Management Authority identified 13 glacial lakes as high-risk, classifying five as extremely dangerous.Senior geologist and former exec director of Uttarakhand Disaster Management Authority Piyoosh Rautela said, ""Such disasters occur when water accumulates at higher elevations and discharges suddenly... Heavy rainfall alone can't cause such a disaster.""","Imd recorded minimal rainfall around the time of the disaster, raising questions about the cloudburst theory.

"Central green nod not needed for constructions of 20,000-150,000 sqm",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/central-green-nod-not-needed-for-constructions-of-20000-150000-sqm/articleshow/123127694.cms,"Development activities can't be stalled altogether, says SC

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court Tuesday reactivated stalled construction activities related to housing, industrial sheds, schools, colleges, universities and hostels with covered area between 20,000 and 1,50,000 square metres by ruling that these can go ahead with the state environmental authority's nod, exempting them from the rigours of securing environmental clearance from the Centre.On Feb 24, SC had ex parte stayed the Jan 29 central notification on environmental clearance norms for building and construction projects on a plea by NGO Vanashakti, which alleged that dilutions in norms would damage nature and forests. This had stalled thousands of projects - educational, industrial and national - across the country.A bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran upheld the environment ministry's notification and said no central environmental nod would be required for these categories of constructions.SC quoted additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, who said the Centre did not have wherewithal to carry out environment scrutiny of projects in states.However, the bench struck down total exemption from environmental scrutiny to industrial sheds, schools, colleges, universities and hostels in the Jan 29 notification of the environment and forest ministry. Supreme Court said these could be constructed after clearance from the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA).Importantly, the bench resolved an ambiguity over which authority - State or Centre - should grant clearance to projects located in eco-sensitive areas, wildlife protected areas, critically and severely polluted areas (CPA/SPA) and those near inter-state boundaries. SC upheld the notification granting the power to the state.Appearing for Godrej's real estate arm, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said the regime exempting such projects from central nod has been in place since 2006 and that the Jan 29 notification was introducing no new concept.He was supported by senior advocate Atmaram Nadkarni, who appeared for CREDAI, the apex body of private real estate developers.CJI Gavai and Justice Chandran said, ""No country can progress without development. Duty to protect the environment and ecology is paramount, but development activities cannot be stalled altogether.""Bhati informed the bench that because of the ex parte stay granted by the SC bench led by Justice A S Oka on Feb 24, thousands of building construction projects across the country in the educational and industrial sector have been stalled and applications seeking clearance are piling up before SEIAA, with Maharashtra alone having more than 700 such pending applications.When the bench asked NGO Vanashakti's counsel Gopal Sankaranarayanan why SEIAA be not permitted to give clearance to such projects, the counsel said it would dilute the stringent environment protection regime for constructing huge projects with covered areas of nearly 2 lakh to 15 lakh square feet. It should be subjected to environmental clearance from the Centre, he further said. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said that environmental impact assessment authorities at the central and state levels have similar expertise and pointed out the qualifications of members comprising the two authorities.","Housing, industrial sheds, schools, colleges, universities and hostels with covered area between 20,000 and 1,50,000 square metres can go ahead with the state environmental authority's nod. This exempts them from the rigours of securing environmental clearance from the centre.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123127695,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1445974,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
