NEW DELHI: In a tense contest between two BJP colleagues, former Union minister and Saran MP Rajiv Pratap Rudy seemed to have gained an unassailable lead over another ex-Union minister Sanjeev Balyan in the polls for the post of secretary (administration) at Constitution Club of India. Rudy was steadily widening his margin when reports last came in late on Tuesday.What was once a low-profile election acquired exciting dimensions this year, drawing prominent netas from various parties to cast their votes, thanks to Baliyan being in the fray with open support of another prominent BJP face, Nishikant Dubey.The Saran MP, of course, held on to his core support base among BJP colleagues.Union ministers Amit Shah, J P Nadda, Piyush Goyal and Kiren Rijiju from BJP, along with Congress's Sonia Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge, voted in the keenly contested election.Himachal Pradesh governor Shiv Pratap Shukla also turned up to cast his vote as the candidates lobbied intensively to rally supporters.Balyan's campaign had appeared to be growing in strength but a vigorous pitch for him by Dubey, a vocal critic of the Congress leadership led many from the opposition benches to develop an interest in the outcome of what had started as a BJP versus BJP affair. Rudy may have benefited from the twist, noted a keen watcher.Of the 1,295 current and former MPs eligible to vote, 679 cast their ballots in person, with an additional 38 postal ballots, totalling 707 votes - over 60% turnout.With a decisive lead, Rudy reacted by saying, ""When Congress leader Sonia ji arrived along with Kharge saheb, and from our party Amit Shah ji and Nadda saheb came, the true spirit of democracy was seen in the Constitution Club elections."" ""For the first time, people learned about an institution called the Constitution Club, a body of MPs and former MPs with history and dignity,"" Balyan said.

Here is what happened during the hearing

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal , appearing for RJD MP Manoj Jha, said that the exclusion of about 65 lakh voters from the draft electoral roll published on August 1 is illegal.

, appearing for RJD MP Manoj Jha, said that the exclusion of about 65 lakh voters from the draft electoral roll published on August 1 is illegal. However, the top court said that as per the rules, the persons excluded have to submit applications for inclusion, and it is only at this stage that anyone's objection will be considered.

Sibal argued that most of the population of Bihar does not posses the documents specified by the ECI as acceptable. “Bihar people don't have these documents, that's the point.”

Justice Kant said it was a “very sweeping argument” to suggest no one in Bihar possessed valid documents, noting Aadhaar and ration cards existed but could not be treated as definitive proof.

“Bihar is part of India. If they don't have them, other states won't either,” the top court said. “There must be something to prove you are a citizen of India… everybody possesses some certificate - you need it even to buy a SIM. OBC, SC, ST certificates.""

Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for Association for Democratic Reforms, said that the poll body not published a list of names of the 65 lakh persons who have been deleted from the draft roll. He also accused the EC of not specifying who are dead or migrated persons.

""Today, what they have done is something mischievous. Till the 4th of August, the draft of the roll was searchable. After the 4th of August, the document is not searchable. They say, go and ask the Booth Level Agent of the political party. Why should I, as a citizen, not know from their document and should ask an agent of the political party?"" Bhushan said.

Meanwhile, appearing for the EC, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said an exercise of this nature was “bound to have some defects”, but errors could be corrected before the final roll is published on 30 September. Opposition leaders and civil society groups have petitioned against the EC’s June 24 decision.

Senior Advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi said ""You cannot start by presumptively doubting the citizenship of 5 crore of voters (who are in the post-2003 roll). The presumption is that they are citizens unless established otherwise through a procedure in accordance with the law....If you declare 5 crore people to be not valid and give them 2.5 months.""

Political activist Yogendra Yadav, who addressed the court in person, questioned the data given by the poll panel and said instead of 7.9 crore voters there was total adult population of 8.18 crore and the design of SIR exercise was to delete the voters. ""They (EC) were not able to find any individual whose name was added and the booth level officers visited house to house for deletion of names,"" Yadav said, calling it a case of ""total disenfranchisement"".

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday reiterated that it can set aside the results of the entire special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral bonds in poll-bound Bihar - in as late as September - if its illegality is established.While hearing a bunch of petitions against poll body's exercise, a bench of justices Surya Kant and Joymala Bagchi said that logjam over the exercise is largely due the ""trust deficit"" between the poll body and the opposition.The hearing will resume again on Wednesday.On July 29, the top court warned it would step in immediately if there was “mass exclusion” of voters.

Four days later, just before she was due for her final vaccine dose, she died.For her family, the Supreme Court’s order on Monday to remove stray dogs from all Delhi localities and place them in shelters is not only a policy decision but also a form of justice.""We don't want even our enemies to go through what we underwent.

I hope there are no more Chhavis, who are hurt elsewhere. Nobody should go through the cruel fate we underwent,"" she said.The Supreme Court described the stray dog situation in Delhi as “extremely grim” and directed the Delhi government and civic bodies to immediately start picking up stray dogs and keeping them in shelters.It also warned of strict action against anyone obstructing the process.Chhavi’s family said the order brought them some relief. ""We heard about the Supreme Court's verdict on TV. The first thing we felt was a sigh of relief. Now I hope they take these animals to places where they can't hurt us,"" Krishna Devi was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.""Just like gaushalas (cowsheds) are built for cows, something must be built for these dogs. We are not fighting the animals; we just want them kept separate so they don't hurt us. And those who feed them should be made accountable — they feed them on the streets and leave, and these dogs form packs and chase children,"" she added.Another family in the city has also faced a similar incident. Dheeraj Ahuja, a resident of Ashok Vihar, said his seven-year-old son, who often fed stray dogs, was mauled by one in their neighbourhood.""We welcome this Supreme Court order. It is a great, though delayed, step. My son, who is in Class 7, had to take 10 injections. The child who once fed these dogs was brutally attacked,"" he said, as quoted by PTI.Ahuja also addressed those opposing the order. ""They should come forward, adopt these dogs and keep them in their homes. Our suffering is personal and we hope this is implemented strictly,"" he added.","Six-year-old chhavi sharma was bitten by a stray dog while walking to her aunt's house.

NEW DELHI: Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday alleged “vote-chori” (vote theft) in 48 Lok Sabha constituencies, including Bengaluru Central, which he had previously flagged, news agency ANI reported.According to Congress sources, Gandhi told a meeting of senior party leaders chaired by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge that these constituencies — where the party lost to the BJP by narrow margins — saw the same “module” of irregularities used in Bengaluru Central. “The party will share details about these seats in 7–8 phases,” the sources added.In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP won 240 seats — 63 fewer than in 2019 — while the Congress nearly doubled its tally, rising from 52 to 99 seats.Following the Maharashtra assembly elections, held just months after the Lok Sabha polls, Gandhi has repeatedly alleged a “fixed match” between the Election Commission and the ruling BJP. In the general elections, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance — which includes the Congress — had won more seats than the BJP-led Mahayuti in Maharashtra. However, the Mahayuti went on to sweep the state assembly polls.On August 7, Gandhi unveiled what he had been describing as an “atom bomb” of evidence against the Election Commission. Citing data from the Mahadevapura assembly segment, which falls under the Bengaluru Central parliamentary constituency in Congress-ruled Karnataka, he accused the poll body of “colluding” with the BJP.The Election Commission has firmly rejected the allegations and asked Gandhi to sign an affidavit to formalise his complaint.

'Who Runs the House, You or Amit Shah?' Kharge Attacks Speaker In Rajya Sabha, Rijiju Responds

Prominent leaders of different parties, including Union ministers Amit Shah and J P Nadda of the BJP and Sonia Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge of the Congress, voted on Tuesday in the keenly contested Constitution Club of India polls, as two seasoned ruling party members slug it out for a key position.Incumbent Secretary (Administration) Rajiv Pratap Rudy , a fifth-term Lok Sabha MP, is facing a spirited challenge to his nearly 25 years at the helm from fellow BJP leader Sanjeev Balyan , a two-term former Lok Sabha MP.Over 690 votes were cast out of the total electors of 1,295 current and former MPs, officials said, making it one of the highest turnouts for the election to the club's office-bearers.Rudy had a slight lead over Balyan after initial rounds, with results expected to be out late in the night.Several Union ministers, including Piyush Goyal and Kiren Rijiju, and governors like Shiv Pratap Shukla of Himachal Pradesh, voted as contestants lobbied intensively to rally their supporters.Rudy has been a dominant presence, winning several elections uncontested, before Baliyan, spurred by the support from some BJP leaders with Lok Sabha MP Nishikant Dubey being the most visible campaigner, decided to test the Bihar leader's strength.The elections include 14 members vying for the position of 11 executive members.Both former Union ministers, Rudy and Baliyan, may be from the same party but present two contrasting personalities drawn from different social milieus.Rudy, a commercial pilot, is a suave and polished leader who is at home with social elites, mixing his urbane personality effortlessly with his background as a savvy parliamentarian who has got the better of the likes of Rabri Devi and her daughter Rohini Acharya in Lok Sabha elections from Saran.Baliyan, who is from western Uttar Pradesh, is a representative of rural sensibilities and grassroots ruggedness. Warm and upfront, he has his share of close friends in the BJP and outside.That Rudy is a Thakur and his rival a Jat has given the contest an expected caste angle, but personal ties and behind-the-scenes manoeuvring are likely to play a big role in the final outcome.While Rudy has listed the addition of numerous facilities to the club under his tenure to seek another term, Balyan is rooting for a change, claiming that the club should focus on catering to MPs and former MPs and not ""outsiders"" like IAS and IPS officers.The Lok Sabha Speaker is the ex-officio president of the club. But the Secretary plays a crucial role in the executive functioning of the facility.","Incumbent secretary (administration) rajiv pratap rudy is facing a spirited challenge to his nearly 25 years at the helm from fellow bjp leader sanjeev balyan.

Aadhaar 'not conclusive proof': SC backs EC in Bihar SIR; Sibal alleges ID rejection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bound-to-have-defects-ec-defends-bihar-voter-roll-exercise-sc-seeks-details/articleshow/123253782.cms,"Poll Should Aadhaar be accepted as valid proof of residence for electoral roll updates? Yes No

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday backed the view that Aadhaar cannot be accepted as conclusive proof of residence in the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar.Kapil Sibal, appearing for the petitioners, argued that despite residents holding Aadhaar, ration and EPIC cards, officials were “not accepting it” as proof of anything. Justice Kant said such documents could “bonafide show you’re resident of that area”, as quoted by LiveLaw.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi heard senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing RJD leader Manoj Jha, who alleged discrepancies — including people listed as dead being found alive, and vice versa.The top court said that the logjam over the revision of electoral rolls is largely due the ""trust deficit"" between the poll body and the opposition.Justice Kant said it was a “very sweeping argument” to suggest no one in Bihar possessed valid documents, noting Aadhaar and ration cards existed but could not be treated as definitive proof.Appearing for the EC, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said an exercise of this nature was “bound to have some defects”, but errors could be corrected before the final roll is published on 30 September.Opposition leaders and civil society groups have petitioned against the EC’s June 24 decision.On July 29, the top court warned it would step in immediately if there was “mass exclusion” of voters.

NEW DELHI: In a relief to owners facing the threat of their overage vehicles being impounded by city authorities, Supreme Court Tuesday directed no coercive action be taken against them and agreed to re-examine its 2018 order by which it had banned the plying of over 15-year-old petrol and 10-year-old diesel vehicles.The respite came after SG Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for Delhi govt, appealed to a three-judge bench led by CJI Gavai to recall the order on the grounds it was causing hardships to citizens of Delhi and that pollution, contrary to assumption, is not directly related to the age of vehicles due to advancements in technology and use of BS VI emission norm.Also read: Delhi govt requests SC to review 2018 blanket ban affecting middle class the most In its application, govt said there was a need for a graded, balanced and technology-driven regime to handle vehicular pollution, and that instead of an age-based blanket ban, a scientific and data-driven framework should be developed that considers all relevant indicators to ascertain pollution by individual vehicles. It submitted such a policy would ensure not only the protection of the environment through the phasing out of polluting vehicles but also preserve the rights of responsible vehicle owners.A senior citizen and owner of a 2011 BMW car, apprehending impounding of his vehicle, also moved the court and his lawyer Charu Mathur contended that a complete ban on vehicles based on their age rather than fitness or compliance with emission norms was wrong and needed to be examined.The bench, also comprising Justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria, after a brief hearing, agreed to examine their plea. ""Issue notice. Returnable in four weeks. In the meantime no coercive steps should be taken against the owners of (such) vehicles on the ground... List it after four weeks,"" it said.The 2018 SC order was not vigorously implemented by authorities and was done only last year, which led to public outcry, following which the drive to impound the vehicles was halted. This compelled govt to seek recall of the SC order.The govt in its application said, ""It is submitted that if the order of this court dated 29.10.2018 continues to operate, it will result in road worthy, non-polluting BS-VI vehicles also going off the roads in a matter of a few years without a scientific basis for the same.

1 of every 3 faculty posts vacant across 20 AIIMS



NEW DELHI: There is an exodus of doctors from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) across the country, with as many as 429 resigning from 20 institutes from 2022 to 2024, data shared by the govt with Parliament has revealed. The govt was responding to a question on doctors leaving AIIMS for private jobs.The data showed the maximum number of doctors - 52 - resigned from AIIMS Delhi, which is the parent institution and the most prestigious of all AIIMS. It was followed by 38 resignations at AIIMS Rishikesh, 35 at AIIMS Raipur, 32 at AIIMS Bilaspur and 30 at AIIMS Mangalagiri. The resignations have come at a time when most AIIMS are struggling with a faculty/doctor crisis.Nearly one out of every three faculty positions was lying vacant across all 20 AIIMS, including Delhi AIIMS, the data showed. Recently, the govt told Parliament in response to another question that provision has been made for hiring on contract basis of retired faculty members - from Institutes of National Importance and govt medical colleges - at the level of professor, additional professor and associate professor in new AIIMS, up to 70 years.In addition to this, the govt said, a visiting faculty scheme has been formulated to allow professors, additional professors and associate professors who are holding academic positions in govt institutions within India or academic institutions outside India, to be visiting faculty in new AIIMS for teaching purposes. However, doctors say further action is needed to stop the brain drain.AIIMS Delhi has 1,306 sanctioned faculty positions. Of these, 462 (35%) are vacant. AIIMS Bhopal has 71 (23%) vacant faculty positions, while AIIMS Bhubaneswar has 103 (31%) vacant positions. The percentage of vacant faculty positions in other AIIMS also ranges between 20% and 35%.Many non-faculty positions, including those of nurses, OT technicians and other crucial staff are also lying vacant."" over the last few years, focus has shifted towards improving the services and often we receive complaints about the lack of 'protected time' to carry out research, which is an important reason for the brain drain,"" a senior doctor from AIIMS who recently joined the private sector said.The senior doctor added that salaries in the private sector are four to 10 times the salary offered at AIIMS.","There is an exodus of doctors from all india institute of medical sciences (aiims) across the country.
