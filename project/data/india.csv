NEW DELHI: A petition has been filed in Supreme Court challenging Uttar Pradesh government's directive to shopkeepers to put up QR codes at their eateries along the route of Kanwar Yatra, which could be scanned to reveal the names of the owners. SC is likely to hear the matter on July 15.In July last year, SC had stopped govts of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, among others, from implementing their directives to shop owners and hawkers along the routes of Kanwar Yatra to display their names, along with those of staff members, at their outlets, and held that food sellers only needed to mention the kind of food they were serving. ""We deem it appropriate to pass interim order prohibiting the enforcement of the impugned directives.

GOKARNA: A Russian woman and her two minor daughters were escorted to safety by the police from a cave near Ramateertha Falls in Gokarna forest on Friday.

Upon interrogation, the woman revealed she had come to India on a tourist visa in 2017 and had been residing in Goa ever since, before entering Karnataka four days ago.A team led by inspector Sridhar SR from Gokarna police station was on patrol to ensure tourist safety in Ramateertha Hill Friday evening when they noticed some suspicious movements in a cave, prompting the team to take a closer look.The cops discovered, much to their dismay, that there was a Russian woman named Nina Kutina living there along with her two daughters, six-year-old Prema and four-year-old Ama.Nina claimed she had come to Karnataka for meditation. Police found an idol of Lord Rama in the cave, which Nina said she worshipped.However, the location that Nina said she chose for her meditation has raised many an eyebrow. Ramateertha Hill is a dangerous and landslide-prone area, inhabited by snakes and other poisonous creatures.While the woman and her daughters were temporarily moved to a women's rehabilitation centre, police and forest department staff conducted a search at the cave and found Nina's passport and visa, with the latter bearing April 17, 2017, as expiry date.Police have contacted the Foreigners Regional Registration Office in Bengaluru to arrange for the repatriation of the woman and her kids to Russia.","Came to k'taka for meditation: russian woman named nina kutina.

We went there, but to our surprise, everything appeared to be normal. Everyone was sitting quietly in the examination hall—it was a mathematics paper.”“I noticed that only this student did not have his question paper.

Tejashwi Yadav Questions Validity Of 80% Bihar Voter Forms, Flags ECI Silence On Fake Uploads

Official: Poll rolls will be purged of anyone flagged as foreigner

PATNA: Bihar’s ongoing special intensive revision of electoral rolls has unearthed an unspecified number of illegal immigrants from Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar residing in the state and aiming to become voters with Aadhaar, ration cards and domicile certificates acquired through fraud, Election Commission sources said Sunday based on reports from booth-level officers.The purported findings of the door-to-door voter verification campaign have already become a political hot potato, with RJD’s Tejashwi Prasad Yadav dismissing these as “rubbish”. EC is still to make an official statement.Officials said that the final poll rolls would be purged of anyone flagged as a foreigner during the survey.The rolls are to be published on Sept 30. The house-to-house verification exercise started on June 25 with the focus on verifying places of birth. Teams conducting the survey have found “a considerable number of people from neighbouring countries” during their visits across the state, sources said.Tejashwi, leader of opposition in the state assembly, held a presser in Patna to question the credibility of the sources behind the “claim” that foreigners had infiltrated the rolls with fake papers.“Has Election Commission issued any document or press release on the matter? This claim is based on ‘sources’ whom I have no reason to believe,” he said.BJP shot back, saying Tejashwi and the rest of the opposition were “nervous” about losing their allegedly “illegal vote base”. “If Tejashwi had his way, he would allow citizens from Bangladesh and Pakistan to vote through postal ballots. No wonder the intensive rolls revision has left the entire opposition worried,” said state BJP spokesperson Manoj Sharma.He accused RJD supporters of helping illegal immigrants get their names included in the rolls. “Why else is Tejashwi concerned about illegal migrants being weeded out, but not Bihari migrants outside the state who have still to be included in the electoral rolls?""",Official: poll rolls will be purged of anyone flagged as foreigner during the survey.

Emotional distress a key factor

Investigation and post-mortem underway

NEW DELHI: The body of 19-year-old Sneha Debnath, a Delhi University student who went missing on July 7, was recovered from the Yamuna River under the Geeta Colony flyover, Delhi Police confirmed on Sunday. The discovery marks a tragic end to a week-long search operation that began after a suspected suicide note was found at her residence, ANI repoted.Sneha, a resident of South Delhi’s Paryavaran Complex and a B.Sc. Mathematics (Honours) student at Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College, had reportedly told close friends and family through messages and emails on the morning of her disappearance that she was in emotional distress.According to investigators, Sneha’s family discovered a note indicating her intention to jump off the Signature Bridge. A cab driver later confirmed he had dropped her there on the same day. Technical surveillance placed her last known phone location at the bridge, while eyewitnesses also reported seeing a girl standing alone at the edge of the bridge around sunrise.Moments later, she was no longer in sight.Police registered an FIR at Mehrauli Police Station under Section 140(3) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).A joint operation with the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) was launched, covering a wide area along the Yamuna, from Nigam Bodh Ghat to Noida. The operation led to the recovery of a female body that matched Sneha’s physical description and clothing.“We had been conducting an extensive search since July 7. The body recovered matches the description shared by her family,” a senior police official said.Friends close to Sneha revealed she had been withdrawn and visibly upset in recent months. On the morning of July 7, she sent farewell messages via email and WhatsApp to several people in her circle, raising alarms about her mental state.Although initial assessments suggest drowning as the cause of death, the police have initiated a forensic examination to rule out foul play and confirm the circumstances.Sneha hailed from Sabroom in South Tripura and had come to Delhi for higher education. Her death adds to a growing number of mental health-related incidents in the national capital, sparking renewed conversations around support systems for young people in distress.The case remains under investigation.","Sneha debnath, 19, a delhi university student, went missing on july 7.

From having legs hacked off to getting Rajya Sabha foothold: A Master's journey of grit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-having-legs-hacked-off-to-getting-rajya-sabha-foothold-a-masters-journey-of-grit/articleshow/122424644.cms,"File photo: Sadanandan Master, who lost both legs in political violence, got nominated to Rajya Sabha

NEW DELHI: It was May 2016. Speaking at a rally in Kasaragod, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held up the hand of C Sadanandan Master as he lamented the silence imposed on the story of the victim of barbaric poll violence. Coming from a family of hardcore CPM members, the 30-year-old school teacher was influenced by the writings of poet Akkitham and turned into a votary of RSS's philosophy of cultural nationalism. He was dubbed a traitor by his comrades, who punished the defection by hacking off both his legs in 1994. The limbs were mutilated so that they could not be rejoined. The PM breached the ""silence"" on Sunday that he complained about nine years ago by announcing Sadanandan Master's nomination to Rajya Sabha - a move that lakhs of members and sympathisers of RSS would applaud.For, if the atrocity was meant to intimidate him into submission, the attackers failed miserably. Sadanandan, popularly known as Master or 'Maashay', who is now dependent on his prosthetic legs, did not let the gruesome attack deter him from taking on the powerful CPM in their stronghold of Kannur and elsewhere, and propagating Hindutva. Importantly, he has been arguing against the use of violence to settle political and ideological disagreements.If the recognition of Sadanandan Master helps explain his enduring appeal among lay supporters of RSS, the PM gave them another reason to celebrate on Sunday: the nomination of historian Meenakshi Jain. Part of the rare breed that challenged the dominant Left historiography, Jain had to endure resistance and ridicule in academic circles. She, however, earned the admiration of Hindutva circles by detailing the destruction of temples in the medieval period, a taboo area for 'mainstream' historians. Her books - 'Flight of Deities and Rebirth of Temples', 'The Battle for Rama: Case of the Temple at Ayodhya', and 'Rama and Ayodhya' - are evidence of the tenacity with which she pursued her passion. Ujjwal Nikam , the Mumbai lawyer who successfully argued for death penalty for Ajmal Kasab of 26/11 infamy and had earlier argued the 1993 Mumbai serial bomb blasts case, is not known for his links with RSS. Yet, his nomination appears to be part of Modi rewarding those who turn out to be symbols of the cause.Ditto for Harsh Vardhan Shringla, the career diplomat who served as foreign secretary under Modi 2.0. He was seen as BJP's choice for the Darjeeling LS seat in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections before the leadership deferred to the in-house wisdom that the incumbent be retained. The PM may have gone along with the majority view, but did not let the former ambassador slip off his radar.A Leftist-turned-RSS karyakarta, Sadanandan Master's life has been one of sacrifices and a symbol of resilience and unwavering public service in the face of a brutal political attack on him in 1994 in Kannur. For 31 years, Sadanandan Master has been living with these scars when CPM workers severed both his legs, mutilated them on the surface of the road so that he couldn't undergo limb replantation and left him writhing in pain.The brutal attack didn't deter Sadanandan Master as he returned to his teaching job and social service on prosthetic legs. He has consistently spoken out against political violence, especially in Kannur, and has advocated peace and dialogue.""The psychology of violence is that of action and reaction. I am a victim of political violence, and I have always maintained that in my individual capacity, I am willing to take on any role to end this violence,"" he had told TOI in 2016.Sadanandan Master unsuccessfully contested the 2016 and 2021 assembly elections in Kerala on a BJP ticket from the Koothuparambu constituency in Kannur district. Currently, he is the vice president of BJP's Kerala unit.","C sadanandan master, who lost both legs in political violence, got nominated to rajya sabha.

The initiative aims to target those exploiting people’s faith in Devbhoomi by defrauding them in the name of religion.According to senior superintendent of police (SSP) Ajay Singh, 23 individuals pretending to be saints and sadhus were arrested across various police station areas in Dehradun on Saturday. He confirmed that 10 of the arrested are residents of other states.Speaking to ANI, Singh said, “Under this campaign, the police took action in various police station areas on Saturday and arrested 23 fake babas roaming around in the guise of saints and sadhus. Among the arrested fake babas, 10 persons are residents of other states.”The CM instructed all station in-charges to identify such individuals and take firm action. Police say these fake seers often target women and young people, promising solutions to personal or domestic problems, only to defraud them.“In line with the instructions, all the station in-charges have been instructed to identify such persons in their respective police station areas, who disguise themselves as saints and mislead people, especially women and youth, and lure them to solve their personal or domestic problems and commit fraud with them, and take strict action against them,” Singh told ANI.Hindu religious bodies have welcomed the campaign, describing it as necessary to protect the sanctity of Sanatan Dharma. They called for strict punishment for those misusing religion for personal gain.Ravindra Puri, President of the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad, supported the move and emphasised the need to safeguard Kanwariyas from fraud.“Kanwar is being conducted in Haridwar and we welcome this decision by the Chief Minister and thank him as well... The fake saints ask for money from and cheat Kanwariya and abuse those who refuse to give money; these people should be subjected to strict action... Our Chief Minister's vision is a safe Uttarakhand, and doing justice to all the Kanwariya and all of us are with him,” Puri said.The Akhand Parshuram Akhada also extended support, urging authorities to verify the identity of such individuals.“We welcome this campaign... There are some fake seers who bring disgrace to our respected saints, the Aadhar card of such imposters should be checked... While India is about to become Vishwaguru, only original saints must be there... There are some seers (fake ones) who have committed a crime, and action must be taken on such people...” said its president.State BJP President Mahendra Bhatt also said that anyone trying to disrupt social harmony should be subjected to strict action.“Some criminal elements try to ruin social environment. Everyone must follow the laws made by the government...

CBI HIDING RAPISTS: Shocking Cover-up Allegation by RG Kar Victim's Father, Vows to Reveal Truth

KOLKATA: A forensic team collected Sunday soft drink and water bottles, two types of hair strands, and other samples from a sealed hostel room in a premier Kolkata management institute, where a 24-year-old psychologist accused a student of drugging and raping her during a supposed counselling session. However, the probe hit a wall as the ""woman and her family refused to cooperate"".""In an ideal situation, we would have spoken to the survivor at length, got her medico-legal test done, and collected her clothes and phone, which are all crucial evidence in such a probe. However, we haven't been able to do this as the survivor is not cooperating. We called her to the police station, but she has not come,"" said a senior officer.The woman alleged she was offered pizza and a drink after being invited to the male student's hostel room Friday. But the case took a turn within 12 hours of the complaint when her father publicly denied any crime had occurred and accused police of coercion. The family's two-storey house in a semi-urban village, 12km from the B-school, may hold answers to the silence. The village is a curious mix of modernity and tradition - paved roads, gaming computers, and women running sewing schools - yet still bends under the weight of conservatism.Cellphones buzz in every household. As does silence when questions of justice arise.Attempts to reach the survivor's family were thwarted by four youths on bikes. ""They have nothing to say. They are not at home,"" one of them said curtly. The woman's advocate father declined to speak. Kamal Mia, a 60-year-old village elder who prays thrice daily at the local mosque, said: ""My grandson is studying medicine. There's a big difference between new and old generations.""A nine-member SIT began work amid what officials called ""zero help"" from the complainant and her family. Police collected logbooks from the main gate and hostel entrance, along with CCTV footage from multiple campus zones, in an attempt to build a timeline and verify claims.The family's silence isn't restricted to police. Both state and national women's panels have launched suo motu probes, but failed to speak with the woman or her family.","Kolkata b-school rape probe hits wall as'survivor', her advocate father won't speak.

ON CAM: Flash Floods Wreak Havoc In Himachal Pradesh's Kullu, Over 20 Vehicles Damaged

KULLU: It does take a village to raise a child. An 11-month-old baby was left all alone when her parents and grandmother were swept away in flashfloods following a cloudburst in Mandi district on June 30. What followed the tragedy was a heartwarming tale of a community turning into a family.Orphaned, yet surrounded by love, little Nikita still looks for her mother in the crowd of familiar and unfamiliar faces but gentle hands and kind eyes try to fill the void.There was no dearth of hearts reaching out to adopt her but Nikita's relatives decided Sunday, after her parents' last rites - she would live with her paternal aunt, Kirna Devi. Several schools have also called up the family, offering to enrol Nikita, who turns one on Aug 14, for free when the time comes.Nikita had a miraculous escape on the night of June 30 when a flashflood, triggered by a cloudburst, struck Talwara village of Gohar subdivision in Himachal Pradesh's Mandi district. While Nikita survived the gushing torrents, most of her family members were swept away.Her 31-year-old father, Ramesh Kumar, was trying to stop the water from entering the house when the waters roared in.His body was later found amid debris nearby. The baby's 24-year-old mother, Radha Devi, and 59-year-old grandmother, Poornu Devi, were also washed away. No trace has been found of them.Talwara village lay devastated. When villagers went about checking on families and assessing damage, an elderly neighbour heard Nikita crying and alerted relatives.Nikita's aunts, Tara Devi and Kirna Devi, took her in their care. And the entire community reached out to the orphaned child.When word got around, Nikita's relatives and the Mandi district administration began receiving calls from couples, even from abroad, to adopt her. However, the family got together and decided against adoption.""Nikita is our blood and we couldn't possibly give her to anyone outside the family. I will raise her like my own,"" said Kirna Devi of Shakauri village near Thunag in Seraj area of Mandi district.On Sunday, the family gathered to cremate Nikita's father and perform the last rites of her mother and grandmother though their bodies are yet to be found.""All close relatives gathered in Talwara to take part in the last rites. It was decided that Nikita would stay with us,"" said Tara's husband, Ramesh Kumar. ""Me and my wife already wanted Nikita to be with us,"" Kirna's husband Aantraran Singh said.Krishan Chand Thakur, a revenue officer posted in Gohar, who visited Talwara village, said a bank account had been opened in Nikita's name as people are coming forward with financial aid.","Nikita had a miraculous escape on the night of june 30 when a flashflood, triggered by a cloudburst, struck talwara village in hp’s mandi district.

Martyrs Day clampdown: ‘Jammu and Kashmir government under detention’ to prevent visits to graveyard; CM calls it a ‘shame’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/martyrs-day-clampdown-jammu-and-kashmir-government-under-detention-to-prevent-visits-to-graveyard-cm-calls-it-a-shame/articleshow/122423538.cms,"File photo: J&K CM Omar Abdullah

SRINAGAR/JAMMU: J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah was barred Sunday from visiting a graveyard of 1931 martyrs in Srinagar, and most of his cabinet colleagues were detained in their homes along with scores of others to keep them away from the site, virtually putting the National Conference (NC) govt under lockdown.Among the other key political figures J&K police confined to their homes were Omar’s father and NC president Farooq Abdullah, former ex-CM Mehbooba Mufti and Peoples Conference chief and MLA Sajad Lone.Omar called the restrictions a “shame” and described “13th July massacre as our Jallianwala Bagh” as he slammed the first such clampdown since his govt took charge in Oct 2024. The Omar-led govt does not control police or security, whose reins are in the hands of the Centre-appointed lieutenant governor (LG) Manoj Sinha, an arrangement that took shape after the 2019 abrogation of J&K’s special status under Article 370.Nasir Aslam Wani, Omar’s political adviser, said the CM had been outside J&K and returned to Srinagar on Sunday but was not allowed to proceed towards Naqshband Sahib, the resting place of 22 people killed during an uprising against Dogra ruler Maharaja Hari Singh on July 13, 1931. The date is significant in Kashmir’s history.According to Wani, Omar remained in his house after being stopped. Deputy CM Surinder Choudhary of NC was in Jammu but his Srinagar house was locked.Wani said he himself had been shut in since 3 am Sunday. “An elected government was placed under house detention in J&K by the very people who hailed the 2024 assembly elections as a triumph of democracy. The irony is not just strange, it is tragic,” NC spokesman Tanvir Sadiq told TOI.Omar expressed anger, calling the curbs “blatantly undemocratic” with troops deployed as jailers and major bridges in Srinagar blocked. “I will never understand what the law-and-order govt is so afraid of,” Omar said in a swipe at authorities under LG Sinha.Since early Sunday, authorities shut down major routes. Security was tightened at Gupkar Road, home to top politicians including Farooq, Omar, education minister Sakina Itoo and CPM MLA MY Tarigami. I too posted that she had been “put under house arrest since last (Saturday) night”. The NC head office was sealed with concertina wire. PDP office was shut, too. A popular Sunday flea market in the Lal Chowk area was not allowed. All roads leading to the graveyard at Naqshband Sahib were closed. Senior cops were at the site.Amid the restrictions, Omar sought to counter the established narrative on the 1931 uprising by likening it to Jallianwala Bagh and claiming it was against the British. “The people who laid down their lives did so against the British. Kashmir was being ruled under the British Paramountcy. What a shame that true heroes who fought against British rule in all its forms are today projected as villains only because they were Muslims. We may be denied the opportunity to visit their graves today but we will not forget their sacrifices,” the CM posted.PDP chief Mehbooba called for “acceptance” of the martyrs. “The day you accept our heroes as your own just as Kashmiris have embraced yours, from Mahatma Gandhi to Bhagat Singh, that day, as Prime Minister Modi once said, the dil ki doori (distance of hearts) will truly end,” Mehbooba said. Former PDP minister Naeem Akhtar, also locked in, posted that “it feels like we are in 1931”.In Jammu, the BJP leader of opposition, Sunil Sharma, sought to contest projections of the 1931 episode as martyrdom. He had sparked bedlam in the assembly this March by calling the martyrs “traitors”. “Communal violence was given a false narrative of martyrdom. The recent remarks by Omar, equating Islamist rioters with freedom fighters, are an insult to the nation and its true freedom struggle,” Sharma said Sunday.Deputy CM Choudhary hit back with a veiled jab at the BJP. “If they admire Nathuram Godse, who killed Mahatma Gandhi, what’s wrong in remembering the July 13 martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the rights of people?” Choudhary asked as NC functionaries in Jammu paid tributes.",Omar abdullah was barred from visiting a graveyard of 1931 martyrs in srinagar. Most of his cabinet colleagues were detained in their homes along with scores of others to keep them away from the site. Omar called the restrictions a “shame’ and described “13th july massacre as our jallianwala bagh’ deputy cm choudhary hit back with a veiled jab at the bjp.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122423560,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-30674,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A Russian woman, whose visa expired in 2017, was found and rescued from a secluded cave in the Ramatirtha hills of Kumta taluk, Uttara Kannada district in Karnataka , with her two young children.The 40-year-old Russian national, Nina Kutina, also known as Mohi, who came to India on a business visa and found her way to the sacred coastal town of Gokarna via Goa, was deeply drawn to Hinduism and Indian spiritual traditions, PTI reported.She had been residing in the cave for approximately two weeks with her children, Preya (6) and Ama (4), completely isolated from civilisation.The family had established a basic living space within a natural cave, situated amidst dense forest and challenging terrain.Inside the cave, Mohi maintained a Rudra idol and devoted her time to 'Puja' and meditation, while caring for her children in their isolated dwelling.On Friday, during a standard patrol following a landslide incident, Circle Police Inspector Sridhar's team noticed clothing displayed outside the cave entrance.The officers navigated through the dense vegetation of Ramatirtha Hill to discover Mohi and her children inhabiting the cave.Uttara Kannada Superintendent of Police M Narayana told PTI on Saturday, ""Our patrolling team spotted saree and other clothes being hung for drying outside the cave in Ramatirtha Hill. When they went there, they spotted Mohi along with her children Preya and Ama.""He noted, ""It was quite surprising how she and her children survived in the woods and what they ate. Thankfully, nothing untoward happened to her or the children during their time in the forest.""Officials believe she reached the cave location from Goa.Investigations revealed her visa had lapsed in 2017, with uncertainty surrounding her total duration of stay in India.Narayana stated, ""We have arranged her stay in an ashram, run by a Sadhvi. We have initiated the process to take her to Bengaluru from Gokarna and begin the deportation process.""The authorities have contacted the Russian Embassy through a local NGO to commence deportation procedures.","Nina kutina, also known as mohi, rescued from cave in uttara kannada district.
