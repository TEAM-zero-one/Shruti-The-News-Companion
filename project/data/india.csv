NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) on Thursday conducted raids at multiple locations across Jammu and Kashmir in connection with an ongoing terror conspiracy investigation, officials said, reported news agency PTI.According to the officials, the searches were carried out in 32 locations and include the districts of Pulwama , Kulgam, Shopian , Baramulla, and Kupwara.This is a developing story.","The searches were carried out in 32 locations and include the districts of pulwama, kulgam, shopian, baramulla, and kupwara.

Judges taking poll plunge or govt posts after retirement improper: CJI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judges-taking-poll-plunge-or-govt-posts-after-retirement-improper-cji/articleshow/121635797.cms,"CJI BR Gavai (file photo: PTI)

NEW DELHI: Taking a swipe at judges who resign to contest polls, as Calcutta HC’s Justice Abhijit Ganguly did last year, or take govt posts after retirement, CJI B R Gavai said such decisions raises “significant ethical concerns” and could undermine public trust in judiciary’s integrity.Delivering a lecture at a round table organized by the UK Supreme Court on Tuesday evening, CJI Gavai said, “If a judge takes up another appointment with the government immediately after retirement, or resigns from the bench to contest elections, it raises significant ethical concerns and invites public scrutiny.”“A judge contesting an election for a political office can lead to doubts regarding the independence and impartiality of the judiciary, as it may be seen as a conflict of interest or as an attempt to gain favour with the government,” he said.“The timing and nature of such post-retirement engagements could undermine the public’s trust in the judiciary’s integrity, as it could create a perception that judicial decisions were influenced by the prospect of future government appointments or political involvement,” Justice Gavai said.Flagging this tradition of judges accepting post-retirement assignments, roles and positions from the government, which is as old as the institution, Justice Gavai said, “In light of this, many of my colleagues and I have publicly pledged not to accept any post-retirement roles or positions from the government.This commitment is an effort to preserve the credibility and independence of the judiciary.”The first of the SC judges to accept the post of governorship was Justice S Fazl Ali, whose appointment as Governor of Orissa (now Odisha) was announced by Jawaharlal Nehru government in 1952 when he was still a judge of the Supreme Court. It had raised ethical issues in the legal circles. Since then, many SC judges – Fathima Beevi, P Sathasivam and S Abdul Nazeer - have accepted gubernatorial posts after retirement.Justice Ganguly’s plunge into politics immediately after resigning from Calcutta HC and contesting elections on a BJP ticket was dramatic as he had judicially castigated TMC govt in many cases, including the teachers’ recruitment scam. But there were many such precedents involving SC judges.The much-admired Justice V R Krishna Iyer epitomized the politician-turned-judge-turned-politician. Justice Baharul Islam, an out and out congressman was elected to Rajya Sabha in 1962 and re-elected in 1968, in between unsuccessfully contesting Assam Assembly elections. Islam resigned from RS in 1972 to become a judge of Gauhati HC and retired in 1980 to immediately return to active politics. Nine months after his retirement, the Indira Gandhi govt appointed him as a judge of the SC. He resigned in 1983, weeks after giving a verdict favouring Bihar COM Jagannath Mishra in a corruption case, to contest for the Barpeta Lok Sabha seat. When the elections got countermanded, the Congress elected him to Rajya Sabha in 1983.Even Justice K S Hegde was a congressman and was elected to RS in 1952 for a two-year term and then again in 1954. In 1957, he resigned to become a judge of Mysore HC and became a SC judge in 1967. He, along with Justices J M Shelat and A N Grover, resigned in 1973 when they were superseded by Indira Gandhi govt in 1973 to appoint Justice A N Ray as CJI.Hegde contested and won from Bangalore North constituency in 1977 on a Janata Party ticket and became Speaker of LS. He later joined BJP and was one of its vice-presidents from 1980-86. He had unsuccessfully contested the 1984 LS elections. There are many former judges of the Sc and HCs who gleefully accept govt roles or positions after retirement. Some of the statutes require retired constitutional court judges to head certain institutions.Justices A M Thipsay, Vijay Bahuguna, M Rama Jois, Rajinder Sachar had plunged into politics after retiring as HC judges. Former CJI Ranganath Misra became NHRC chief and then was elected to RS on a congress ticket. Ex-CJI Ranjan Gogoi was nominated to RS.","Cji b r gavai said judges who resign to contest polls or take govt posts after retirement could undermine public trust in judiciary’s integrity. “a judge contesting an election for a political office can lead to doubts regarding the independence and impartiality of the judiciary,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121635881,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-752927,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Supreme Court dismisses Delhi Wakf Board’s claim over Shahdara Gurdwara,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-dismisses-delhi-wakf-boards-claim-over-shahdara-gurdwara/articleshow/121635792.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bringing curtains over a 50-year-old dispute relating to Delhi Wakf Board’s claim over a Delhi gurdwara as waqf property, the Supreme Court on Wednesday said the Sikh religious place has been in existence since 1947 and rejected the Board’s claim that the property was ‘wakf by user’ since time immemorial.Appearing for the Board, senior advocate Sanjay Ghosh told a partial working day bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and Satish Chandra Sharma that the Delhi HC erred in reversing the concurrent findings of trial court and appellate court that it was a wakf by user. He said, “some kind of gurdwara was built over the mosque”.But the bench said the evidence shows that the gurdwara at Shahdara has been functioning at the suit property since 1947. “Not some kind of gurdwara was constructed as you claim. It is a functional gurudwara. This has been admitted by the witness produced by the Board before the trial court. You should voluntarily relinquish any claim over gurdwara.”The bench dismissed the appeal filed by the Board in 2011 against the Delhi HC’s September 24, 2010, judgment. Interestingly, the matter was taken up for hearing by the SC after a gap of 12 years, the last hearing in chamber being before Justice A K Sikri.The HC judgment by Justice Indermeet Kaur had discussed in detail what ‘wakf by user’ meant by relying on several judgments including one by a division bench of the Lahore HC in 1937 and those of the Supreme Court.The Lahore HC had ruled, ""In the absence of any such intention or declaration, no wakf can be said to have been created. It is true that a wakf can be created by user, but that user too must be preceded by an intention on the part of the owner to create a wakf. If no such intention is established, user alone will not be sufficient to divest the property of its private character."" A stand which is similar to that of the Centre in defence of validity of the Wakf Amendment Act, 2025, before the Supreme Court.In the Shahdra gurudwara case, the HC had said the oral and documentary evidence establishes that the disputed property was a private property. “There is no evidence forthcoming to substantiate the Board's claim that there was a permanent dedication of this property by the owner as waqf; there is not a whisper of this either in the pleadings or in the oral version of the witnesses (produced by the Board).”“A mere bald statement in the plaint that this property was being used since time immemorial as a wakf property was not sufficient to establish this plea… in fact there is a admission by a witness that the said property was used as a gurdwara since partition of the country,” the high court had said.","Supreme court rejects delhi wakf board’s claim over a delhi gurdwara as waqf property. Justices sanjay karol and satish chandra sharma dismissed the appeal filed by the board in 2011.

NEW DELHI: At least 11 people died and 33 others were injured as a stampede occurred at Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru after a large number of people gathered to participate in the RCB victory celebrations. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the incident ""absolutely heartrending"" and prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured people. Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah held a press conference and announced Rs 10 lakh as compensation to the kin of those deceased. He also ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident.What was meant to be a day of jubilation turned tragic as a massive crowd gathered to celebrate Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s (RCB) first-ever Indian Premier League (IPL) title win. Scattered shoes, broken sandals, and torn pieces of sports jerseys littered the area, marking the aftermath of the chaos that unfolded when crowds spiralled out of control.Lakhs of young fans had converged outside the stadium with ""RCB"" chanting. Many were seen climbing trees, scaling walls, and clinging to poles in a desperate attempt to catch a glimpse of their cricketing idols.As excitement peaked, the situation turned dangerous.People began to fall, some losing consciousness. Panic spread quickly as the jubilant cheers turned into screams for help. Emergency services rushed the injured to nearby hospitals.Even amid the unfolding tragedy, groups of young fans were seen sitting atop compound walls near Saint Mark's Cathedral, cheering for RCB as sirens wailed and police tried to restore order.Despite a heavy deployment of police personnel, the sheer scale of the crowd overwhelmed security arrangements. Officials acknowledged they were heavily outnumbered by the surging masses.Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the stampede in Bengaluru as ""absolutely heartrending"". In a post on X, he said, ""The mishap in Bengaluru is absolutely heartrending. In this tragic hour, my thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that those who are injured have a speedy recovery.""President Droupadi Murmu also expressed deep sorrow over the loss of lives in a stampede and called the incident 'shocking and heartbreaking'.In a social media post on X, Droupadi Murmu wrote, ""The loss of lives in the tragic happening at a stadium in Bengaluru is shocking and heartbreaking. My condolences to the bereaved families and prayers for the speedy recovery of the injured.""Chief minister Siddaramaiah, while addressing a press conference gave details of the incident, saying that 11 lives were lost and 33 others were reported injured. He added that the stadium has capacity of hosting 35,000 people, but around two or three lakh people gathered to witness the event, and the crowd was unexpected.""11 are dead and 33 injured due to stampede near Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. More than 2-3 lakh people came, and no one expected this much crowd,"" Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah said at a press conference.Further, the CM said that he would not justify the mishap but drew comparisons with similar tragedies elsewhere, like in Kumbh Mela, as BJP criticised his government for the tragedy.""Such incidents happened in so many places. I am not going to defend this by comparing it with them now by saying it happened here and there. In Kumbh Mela, 50-60 people died, I didn't criticise it,"" he said.""If Congress criticises, then that is a different matter. Did I or the Karnataka government criticise?"" CM Siddaramaiah said.The BCCI called the incident shocking adding that the organisers should have been better-prepared.""It's most unfortunate, organisers should have planned RCB's IPL-winning celebrations better,"" BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia told PTI.""When one organises a victory celebration of this magnitude, proper precautions and security measures need to be taken,"" he added.IPL chairman Arun Dhumal said, ""Whatever inquiry that needs to be done, the concerned authorities will do that. It was not a BCCI event. It is sad and tragic.""According to eyewitnesses, fans thronged the venue of felicitation. Visuals showed police shifting the injured persons and those who had fallen unconscious to ambulances.Cops were seen using mild force to manage the crowd outside stadium. They had a tough time in crowd management as a large number of cricket enthusiasts tried to gain entry, at the same time, into the stadium.According to a traffic advisory from the Bengaluru police, entry to Chinnaswamy Stadium was limited to only those with valid tickets and passes. ""As there is limited parking facility available near the Chinnaswamy Stadium, those who are attending the event are advised to use public transport and Metro. The public is requested to cooperate,"" it had said.Karnataka BJP President BY Vijayendra arrived at Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital to meet the injured people.""The state government should take full responsibility for this tragedy. When the whole country and Karnataka were celebrating RCB's victory, the state government's haste to hold a victory rally without any prior preparations led to this tragedy. The state government never cared about prior preparations. They were more interested in publicity. This resulted in the death of more than 11 people. Some people are in ICU. I spoke to some victims, there was no police inside, no ambulance facility. The CM should send the matter for judicial investigation,"" Vijayendra said.The IPL champions and several political leaders, including Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah marked their presence at the victory parade.Also read: Tragedy at RCB's IPL 2025 victory parade: KSCA, franchise break silence on stamped","Prime minister narendra modi called the incident ""absolutely heartrending"" karnataka chief minister siddaramaiah announced rs 10 lakh as compensation to the kin of those deceased.

The announcement caught cops unawares as they had no communication about it. But it sent the already-electrified fanbase into overdrive.Then came the colossal collective failure: Police honchos failed to act swiftly and draw up crowd-control plans. Politicians turned the celebration into a photo-op frenzy, brushing aside warnings in their race to bask in reflected glory.

But the political bosses were in no mood to listen, they wanted us to go ahead with bandobast,"" a policeman said.Till mid-afternoon, there was no clarity whether there was a parade and where the events would be held.

With a rented scooter, a borrowed smartwatch, and the kind of wide-eyed excitement the newlyweds carry, Raja and Sonam Raghuvanshi set off from Indore to the lush, rain-drenched trails of Meghalaya.On May 22, the couple reached Mawlakhiyat village and began the steep 3,000-step trek to Nongriat - home to the famed living root bridges. They spent the night there, surrounded by clouds and forest silence. The next morning, they checked out of their homestay and vanished.What followed was a slow unraveling of a horror no one had imagined.Their scooter was discovered abandoned on May 24, near a café on the Shillong-Sohra road. Then came days of agonising silence until Raja's decomposed body was found deep inside a gorge near Weisawdong Falls.“There is no doubt it was a murder,” said East Khasi Hills SP Vivek Syiem. “We have recovered a dao. It was new and used for this very purpose.”The body was identified by a tattoo on his hand — “Raja and a lady” — and the waterproof smartwatch he had borrowed from his brother. His wallet, gold jewellery, and four mobile phones were gone.A raincoat, possibly belonging to the couple, was later recovered in Mawkma village, just a few kilometres away.Police are still trying to piece together what happened. “Whether the motive was robbery, vendetta or personal enmity, we need to look for more evidence before drawing any conclusions,” SP Syiem added.The search for Sonam continues with drones, sniffer dogs, NDRF teams and mountaineers combing the thick wilderness. But relentless rain has slowed progress.For Raja’s family, the grief is compounded by frustration. His brother Vipin, who has been aiding in the search, said authorities ignored early pleas to explore the very area where the body was eventually found. He also alleged that misleading information may be hampering the investigation.Adding to the chilling puzzle is a voice recording Raja’s mother received from Sonam on May 23 — the last known contact. In it, Sonam can be heard short of breath, telling her mother-in-law she was trekking to a waterfall and refusing to break her religious fast. The call ended suddenly. That was the last time anyone heard from her.The family has refused to cremate Raja’s body in Shillong. They are bringing him back to Indore so his parents can say goodbye.Their demand is clear: a CBI probe and Army assistance. For now, all they have are questions, empty silence - and a borrowed watch that told the time, but not the end.","Raja and sonam raghuvanshi set off from indore to the lush, rain-drenched trails of meghalaya.

NEW DELHI: What was supposed to be a jubilant occasion to celebrate Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s (RCB) first-ever IPL title turned into a tragedy on Wednesday. A deadly stampede near Chinnaswamy Stadium claimed at least 11 lives and left over 30 injured, with two in critical condition. The chaotic scenes have sparked political uproar, a magisterial inquiry, and a call for accountability.Here are the top developments from the scenes:Thousands of RCB fans swarmed the stadium gates and surrounding areas in anticipation of the victory celebrations after RCB’s historic IPL 2025 win. The huge crowd overwhelmed police and security personnel, leading to a deadly stampede near the gates.According to police, eight people died immediately after being rushed to Bowring Hospital, while the death toll later rose to 11. At least 33 others were injured, with several admitted to ICUs.Authorities had deployed a large police contingent, but controlling the massive crowd proved difficult. At Vidhana Soudha, where the felicitation program was held, Karnataka police resorted to mild cane-charge to disperse surging fans.Several people attempted to climb gates, trees, and fences to catch a glimpse of players.Deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar told the media, “I have spoken to the Police Commissioner and everyone.

We are trying to make everything normal... lakhs of people came.”On BJP’s allegations of mishandling, Shivakumar said, “They are there to allege and we are there to protect… Yes, I am going to the hospital.”Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah expressed deep sorrow and said, “This tragedy should not have happened. The government expresses deep sorrow. Most of the deceased are youth.”He announced Rs 10 lakh compensation for families of the deceased and free treatment for the injured.“I don't want to defend this incident. Our government will not do politics on this. I have ordered a magisterial inquiry and given 15 days' time. People even broke the gates of the stadium. There was a stampede. No one expected such a huge crowd. The stadium has a capacity of only 35,000 people, but 2-3 lakh people came,” Siddaramaiah said.In a social media post, the CM wrote, “The pain of this tragedy has even erased the joy of victory. May the souls of the deceased rest in peace, and may the injured recover soon. My condolences to the bereaved families. I appeal to the public to prioritise safety above everything else.”BJP Karnataka president BY Vijayendra slammed the state government, alleging poor planning and lack of preparedness. “The state government should take full responsibility for this tragedy. When the whole country and Karnataka were celebrating RCB’s victory, the state government’s haste to hold a victory rally without preparations led to this. More than 11 people have died. There was no police inside, no ambulance facility. The CM should order a judicial investigation.”BJP MLC Chalavadi Narayanaswamy called the incident a “clear security failure,” saying the government underestimated the crowd size and ignored necessary precautions.Congress leaders expressed their condolences and called for stronger safety protocols.Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge said, “I am deeply saddened by the tragic stampede. My thoughts and prayers are with the families who lost loved ones, and I wish a speedy recovery to the injured.”Rahul Gandhi called the tragedy “heartbreaking” and said, “This tragedy is a painful reminder: no celebration is worth a human life. Every safety protocol for public events must be reviewed and strictly enforced — lives must always come first.”AIMIM Chief Asaduddin Owaisi termed the incident “very unfortunate and heartbreaking” and called for major preventive steps to avoid such tragedies.Union minister HD Kumaraswamy said that the Congress government must take full responsibility, calling the tragedy a result of “lack of proper planning and complete failure to take precautionary measures.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed grief in a social media post, saying, “The mishap in Bengaluru is absolutely heartrending. My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that those who are injured have a speedy recovery.”Fans trapped outside described a “nightmarish” experience. One fan said, “Inside, all the seats are full, and they’re not letting us go in. We want to go back, but we aren’t allowed to. The gates are crowded, and if they open them, more people will rush in. A lot of people have been injured already.”One fan trying to climb a gate to get in fell and broke his leg. Several others climbed trees and fences for a view of the players.BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia criticized the lack of preparedness, saying, “When one organises a victory celebration of this magnitude… safety and security measures need to be taken.”The hastily arranged program sold tickets quickly but security failed to manage the crowds at gates 10, 12, and 13. Police eventually closed gates to prevent ticketless fans from entering, further escalating tensions.Anticipating large crowds, the Karnataka government had cancelled a victory roadshow citing security concerns. The stampede raises questions about the adequacy of the alternative arrangements.BJP national spokespersons Shehzad Poonawalla and Pradeep Bhandari accused the Congress government of “state-sponsored negligence” and “criminal negligence,” demanding accountability from chief minister Siddaramaiah and home minister G Parameshwara.","Stampede claims 11 lives, 33 injured; two in critical condition.

NEW DELHI: A political slugfest erupted between the BJP and the Congress in Karnataka after a celebratory event for Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s IPL victory turned into a deadly stampede in Bengaluru. As the BJP slammed the Congress-led state government for ""gross negligence"" and ""publicity-driven haste"" that led to the loss of lives, deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar defended the decision to continue the event after stampede saying the program was shortened to just 10 minutes.Speaking to the media, Shivakumar said, “I have spoken to the police commissioner and everyone.

NEW DELHI: Despite achieving near-universal enrolment in primary education, India faces persistent challenges in ensuring learning outcomes and strengthening school leadership, says Unesco's Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report 2024-25 released on Wednesday, reports .And the problem is not limited to the country.New Delhi: ""Most teachers are women, but few lead"" is the central message of ""Leadership in Education: Lead For Learning"" section of Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report 2024-25, released on Wednesday by Unesco. The report highlights what is a problem across countries: under-representation of women in leadership positions at all levels of the education system - from schools to education ministries, reports Manash Gohain.Globally, women make up 57% of secondary school teachers, but in most countries the proportion of female principals lags the share of female teachers by at least 20 percentage points. This disparity exists despite growing evidence that gender-diverse leadership correlates with better learning outcomes and more enabling school environment. Similar is the story at the higher education level. While women comprise 45% of higher education faculty, they account for only 30% of leadership roles in universities and colleges.India is no exception to this phenomenon. While women dominate the teaching workforce in primary schools - accounting for over 60% of elementary teachers - their number declines sharply in leadership positions, particularly at the secondary and tertiary levels.The report also examines political leadership in the education sector.

"Census to begin April 2026, caste to be part of survey",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/census-to-begin-april-2026-caste-to-be-part-of-survey/articleshow/121632736.cms,"With tech, census data to be out much faster than in past

NEW DELHI: The Census exercise, put on hold over five years ago due to the Covid outbreak, may start on April 1, 2026, ending with the population count to be taken with the midnight of March 1, 2027 as the reference date. The caste of each resident of the country will be recorded, in a first since the decennial headcount of 1931, as part of the exercise, which potentially holds the key to two other decisions of far-reaching significance - delimitation and implementation of women's quota in legislatures.Sources in the home ministry said the Census - the first one to capture data digitally - will follow a schedule similar to Census 2011; it will be held in two phases - the houselisting phase to be conducted non-synchronously over a 45-day period across states and UTs anytime between April 1, 2026 and Sept 30, 2026; followed by the population enumeration phase, which will also record caste this time, between Feb 9 and 28, 2027. The population count will be recorded as on March 1, 2027, followed by a revisional round from March 1 and 5, 2027.The snow-bound areas of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and J&K, along with Ladakh, will undertake population enumeration six months before the rest of India, that is, sometime in Sept 2026, with the midnight of Oct 1, 2026, being their 'non-synchronous' reference date.There was no clarity on whether National Population Register updation will be done along with the population enumeration phase, like it was done in 2011.The intent to conduct Census after 15 years is bound to be welcomed by policymakers and beneficiaries alike. The exercise is an important data-source for delimitation and reservation of constituencies across all three tiers of govt. It provides a snapshot of the country's population at a given point of time and forms a critical input for planning and formulation of policy initiatives. Census tables also aid research in fields like demography, economics, anthropology, sociology etc.Since the upcoming Census will embrace the digital mode - with respondents free to self-enumerate or have the enumerators capture data on their phones or tablets through the Census app or portal - govt sources said the tables relating to various data fields captured will release much sooner than the earlier decadal counts involving a lag of 5-6 years. A senior functionary said caste data may be released in three years. However, it is unlikely that the caste count by itself will form the basis for reservation.Though a countrywide socio-economic caste census was done in 2011, it returned around 46 lakh castes, with inaccuracies that kept the data from being made public. In recent years, Bihar, Karnataka and Telangana have undertaken their own caste surveys.Census 2027 may also fulfil the condition set under the delimitation law, for being the basis for the next delimitation, which is crucial not only to decide the representation of states/UTs in Lok Sabha but also for implementing 33% reservation for women in LS and state assemblies. As per the law, the next delimitation exercise must be conducted based on the first Census to be undertaken after 2026, though no day or month has been specified.The home ministry on Wednesday said the notification regarding the intent to conduct Census 2027 will tentatively be issued on June 16. Refresher training of enumerators and Census staff may follow; sources did not rule out a fresh pre-test, last conducted in Aug-Sept 2019, in view of digitisation of the process and adding of new data fields like caste.Though only Rs 574 crore was allotted for Census - set to cost over Rs 13,000 crore, along with NPR updation - in 2025-26 Budget, govt sources said finding additional resources was not an issue.Five states/UTs - West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Kerala and Puducherry - are due to go to the polls in May-June 2026 but will have the flexibility to choose a 45-day houselisting schedule anytime between April 1 and Sept 30 to avoid a clash.","The caste of each resident of the country will be recorded, in a first since the decennial headcount of 1931.

Rijiju said Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs (CCPA) has sent the recommendation for the monsoon session to President Droupadi Murmu.The minister said although opposition parties would formally respond in a couple of days, he had been assured of their support and was confident of the same, as there was no scope for politicking as corruption in the judiciary could not be approached through a ""political prism"".Rijiju said he would also reach out to smaller parties as govt wants all parties to ""jointly"" move the motion.""Govt feels the matter related to corruption is not one political party's agenda. It is a stand of all parties to fight against the menace of corruption, whether it is the judiciary or any other space,"" he said.He , however, said the decision on which House the motion would be brought in - LS or RS - would be taken based on the business of each House.According to the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, once a motion to remove a judge is admitted in any of the Houses, the Speaker or the Chairman, as the case may be, will constitute a three-member committee to investigate the grounds on which the removal has been sought.The committee will consist of the CJI or an SC judge, an HC chief justice and a ""distinguished jurist"".Meanwhile, Congress said govt had announced dates for the monsoon session 47 days in advance to run away from the opposition's demand for an immediate special session to discuss Pahalgam terror attack and Centre's ""failure"" to bring the terrorists to justice, the impact of Operation Sindoor and its ""blatant politicisation"".","If justice yashwant varma doesn't resign and holds on to his argument of being ""innocent"", he may earn the unenviable distinction of being the only judge to be removed through parliament's removal motion.

What more can be done beyond banning select single-use plastic (SUP) items, increasing the thickness of plastic carry bags, and notifying extended producer responsibility (EPR) to achieve the desired results on the ground?

What is an obstacle before developing an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution? What is India's stand in this context?

What is India’s plan on updating the country’s climate action pledges (Nationally Determined Contribution) and its submission to the UN body?

What would be the impact of the recent Supreme Court decision of striking down retrospective environmental clearances, specifically the 2017 notification and the 2021 Office Memorandum (OM) that allowed post-facto clearances for projects that began without prior approval?

India has decided to speed up pending and proposed projects (hydro-power, irrigation canals, and others) in the Indus River Basin in Jammu & Kashmir after keeping the Indus Water Treaty in abeyance following the Pahalgam terrorist attack. But many of these projects need environmental and other relevant green clearances. Will the ministry fast-track the clearance process to achieve the country’s objective of completing the projects without further losing precious time?

NEW DELHI: Union environment minister Bhupender Yadavin an interview to TOIresponded to certain questions on critical environmental issues including plastic waste, India's stand on developing an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, implication of the Supreme Court 's recent order of striking down retrospective environmental clearances and the country's plan to update its climate action pledges ahead of the 30th session of the UN climate change conference (COP30) in Brazil later this year. Excerpts:Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made it clear that India is determined to reduce single-use plastic and micro-plastic pollution for sustainable development. In order to address the plastic pollution caused by unmanaged and littered plastic waste, the government focuses on two key pillars: banning identified SUP items with low utility and high littering potential, and effective implementation of EPR on plastic packaging. Ban has already been imposed on identified SUP items since July 1, 2022. The “whole of government” and “whole of society” approach adopted for implementation of the ban has led to development of innovative eco-alternatives to banned SUP items and development of new business models.The ministry is continuously taking steps to promote the use of eco-alternatives. State governments and local bodies have been asked to incentivise the manufacture of eco-alternatives. A compendium of manufacturers and sellers of eco-alternatives has been prepared for wider use by citizens. It is a comprehensive document providing detailed information on manufacturing capacities of eco-alternatives and their availability across the country. Local bodies across the country are being encouraged to set up eco-alternatives stores.The mandate for the use of recycled content in plastic packaging has come into force from April 1. This has played a transformative role in moving towards super clean recycling technologies in plastic packaging waste recycling. More than 130 lakh tonnes of plastic packaging waste have already been processed since 2022. The implementation of SUP ban coupled with extended producer responsibility on plastic packaging will lead to a reduction in pollution caused by littered and unmanaged plastic waste.India believes that the success of negotiations at the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) mandated to develop a legally binding international instrument on plastic pollution requires consensus-based decision-making with a spirit of mutual trust and cooperation for reaching an agreement on various provisions. We believe that in order to reach agreement the instrument should focus on aspects related to plastic pollution only. Aspects which are not directly related to plastic pollution should not be taken up.We need to strike a critical balance between preventing plastic pollution without affecting the right to sustainable development of developing countries, keeping in view their respective national circumstances. As developed countries have higher per capita generation of plastic waste and have historical responsibility, they need to provide financial and technical assistance by setting up a stand-alone multilateral fund which provides incremental cost for transition to developing countries for meeting compliance obligations.At the outset, I would like to highlight that there are 195 countries, which are party to the Paris Agreement. As per information, 171 countries have not submitted their successive NDCs. This is due to a combination of factors, including capacity constraints in developing countries, need for extensive modelling and studies, and careful consideration of the national circumstances and development needs.A pragmatic approach and careful consideration of national circumstance and development priorities is essential for development of necessary policies to enable ambitious NDCs. For this purpose, the government has initiated a series of studies.The nature of goals under India’s successive NDC will be based on outcomes and subsequent consultations thereon. However, it should be noted that the Paris Agreement casts an obligation on the developed nations to take lead by undertaking economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets.The need of the hour is ambitious climate action.
