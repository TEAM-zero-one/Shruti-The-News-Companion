ASI preps for deeper digs to trace Krishna's ancient Dwarka,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/asi-preps-for-deeper-digs-to-trace-krishnas-ancient-dwarka/articleshow/126460369.cms,"Remains of ancient settlement off the Dwarka coast in the Arabian Sea

Upcoming Dwarka exploration phase to be more extensive: ASI

AHMEDABAD: Dwarka, the ancient Gujarat coastal town closely associated with the legend of Lord Krishna and home to the revered Dwarkadhish Temple, is set to witness renewed rounds of archaeological excavations, both on land and underwater, senior officials of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) have said. The proposed work aims to explore previously unexamined areas using modern technology to gain a deeper understanding of the region's historical and cultural past, reports Parth Shastri.Underwater archaeological excavations at Dwarka were last carried out between 2005 and 2007, while limited exploratory studies were conducted again in 2025.According to ASI officials, the upcoming phase will be more extensive and systematic. Alok Tripathi, additional director-general of ASI, told TOI that new areas at Beyt Dwarka and unexplored underwater zones will be covered by the agency's Underwater Archaeology Wing (UAW).""Dwarka has been under study for nearly 40 years, but the work so far has been limited in scope and objectives. We are now examining the other side of the mouth of the Gomti river,"" Tripathi said.Experts said modern tools and technology would be deployed to enable larger and deeper excavations in the Arabian Sea.Tripathi himself was part of the five-member UAW team that conducted underwater exploratory work at Dwarka in Feb last year. During that time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also dived underwater off Dwarka coast to view submerged remains discovered on the seabed, drawing national attention to the site.On land, the focus will be on relatively undisturbed areas of Beyt Dwarka. Earlier excavations were largely concentrated near the cliff area. ""We are now going deeper inside the forest area, where we have observed signs of a significant settlement. The site has some remarkable features, and excavations at lower levels could reveal important details about settlement planning, economic activities, arts and crafts, and the way of life of the inhabitants,"" Tripathi said.The site has attracted attention alike due to the legend of the sunken city of Dwarka, believed to be founded by Lord Krishna. The ASI website indicates that explorations were carried out to understand the submerged archaeological remains off the coast of Dwarka as sculptures and stone anchors were found during low tide in coastal areas.The excavations so far have yielded many antiquities, including terracotta objects, beads, fragmented bangles, copper rings, iron ingots and pottery among others, according to the ASI website.Apart from Dwarka, the ASI has also initiated excavations at other key sites in Gujarat. Work has begun at Valabhipur, the ancient capital located in Bhavnagar district, and at Lothal, the Harappan-era site renowned for its water structure believed to be among the world's oldest dockyards. With the upcoming National Maritime Heritage Complex near Lothal, archaeologists are exposing a larger area of the site using advanced tools and techniques. Tripathi emphasised that archaeology goes beyond excavation. ""Our task is to place findings in perspective and fill gaps in historical understanding,"" he said, adding that India's use of technology in archaeology is on par with global standards and increasingly relies on interdisciplinary approaches.Gujarat has seen significant archaeological activity over the past decade, including extensive ASI-led excavations at Vadnagar in Mehsana district, PM Modi's hometown, uncovering evidence of continuous habitation over two millennia. The state is also home to major Harappan sites such as Dholavira, now a Unesco World Heritage Site, and Lothal, highlighting Gujarat's rich and layered archaeological heritage.","Dwarka, the ancient gujarat coastal town closely associated with the legend of lord krishna, is set to see renewed rounds of archaeological excavations.

""People are scared of police. When children study here, they and their parents see a different face of the police.For us, watching children study inside a police station is a huge stress buster,"" he said.The makeshift school runs entirely on contributions from police station staff. ""We have consciously avoided donations so that the initiative remains simple and transparent,"" Agarwal said. Among the three teachers is an elderly former schoolteacher who lives in a nearby old age home after being abandoned by his family. ""This school has given him dignity and purpose again,"" Agarwal said.Classes are held in three batches, mostly for children studying in govt schools.

BMC Becomes Mega Battleground As Thackerays Reunite And Alliances Shift Ahead Of Civic Wars 2026

PUNE: Estranged cousins Ajit Pawar and Supriya Sule came together for the first time on a political platform on Saturday to release the joint manifesto of NCP and NCP (SP) for the Pune civic polls nearly two-and-a-half years after the split in the family and party. However, both remained non-committal on a possible merger of their outfits. ""Wait and watch,"" said Ajit Pawar, without giving a specific answer to the issue of speculation over the parties' merger.Ajit Pawar's NCP and Sharad Pawar's NCP (SP) formed an alliance for the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporation elections despite being on opposite sides in the state govt and at the Centre. NCP is with the governing alliance in both govts, while NCP (SP) is in the opposition. After the two NCPs forged the alliance, some workers from both sides were disappointed. Speaking on the issue, Sule said, ""When any alliance is formed, some party workers get disappointed. But we will not leave them on their own. On both sides of the alliance, our focus is on workers and not on netas.""When Sule was asked about her absence in the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporation (PCMC) poll campaign, her cousin Ajit Pawar came to the rescue.""She told me to take the lead in the campaign as I am older to her and promised that she would follow me,"" he said.

They had trained guns on each other during the Lok Sabha and assembly polls in 2024 following the split in NCP in July 2023. Sharad Pawar's NCP (SP) approached the court against Ajit Pawar's NCP, claiming ownership of the party's name and the ""clock"" symbol.Asked about speculation over the parties coming together when the case was still in court, the deputy chief minister said, ""We respect the court's order and follow it.

MUMBAI: Just four days before her retirement on Jan 3, former DGP Rashmi Shukla submitted a report to the state home department saying an offence should be registered against ex-DGP and former Mumbai police commissioner Sanjay Pandey, along with two other police officers, for conspiring to arrest Devendra Fadnavis, who was opposition leader, and Eknath Shinde, who was UD minister, during the tenure of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) govt.An SIT was formed to probe the issue raised in the assembly by MLC Pravin Darekar, and it submitted its report to the govt. Shukla was asked to submit her opinion on the report. Pandey declined to comment.The SIT had investigated the allegation of a criminal conspiracy to implicate Fadnavis and Shinde in an urban land ceiling (ULC) certificates scam case. The scam pertained to builders who allegedly submitted bogus ULC certificates and were exempted from surrendering 5% excess land to govt. During the MVA govt's tenure, Thane police had investigated businessman Sanjay Punamia, who was in a dispute with his business partner Shaymsundar Agarwal, in the scam. Afterwards, Punamia had alleged he was pressured to give a statement against Fadnavis and Shinde.Shukla suggested the govt register an FIR against Pandey and police officers Laxmikant Patil and Sardar Patil for criminal conspiracy, a public servant disobeying the law, fabricating evidence, threatening a person to give a false statement, and for conspiring to implicate Fadnavis and Shinde in an old case registered in Thane in 2016.A retired police officer said there is no provision in law where a mere alleged intention to arrest, when no arrest was made, becomes an offence.Laxmikant Patil, then DCP, crime, Thane, used a govt vehicle to visit Mantralaya, Vidhan Bhavan, office of the DGP and Sahyadri guest house in Mumbai, but instead of mentioning the exact location, his drivers wrote only ""Mumbai"" in the vehicle's log book. It was also alleged Laxmikant Patil exerted pressure on the accused and witnesses. It was further said Shukla found that while Punamia was in custody in a 2021 case registered in Thane, Patil interrogated him regarding the ULC scam and pressurised him to give a false statement that Fadnavis extorted money from builders. Retired ACP Sardar Patil was investigating the case.The investigating officer conducted a re-investigation on the basis of an application submitted by one Raju Shaha to the then DGP Pandey in May 2021. The chargesheet in the case was submitted in 2017. The SIT said that on the instruction of Pandey, Laxmikant Patil arranged an appointment for Shaha with him (then DGP) for submission of an application, based on which police started the re-investigation of the Thane case with an intention to implicate Fadnavis and Shinde. Subsequently, Pandey became Mumbai police commissioner, and he allegedly pressured a junior officer to file charges against Fadnavis in an offence registered with cyber police in BKC. Pandey spent five months in jail after retirement on charges of alleged money laundering.BJP Mumbai president Ameet Satam said there ""was an invisible hand which was none other than that of then CM Uddhav Thackeray"" behind Pandey's act.",Former dgp rashmi shukla submitted a report to govt just 4 days before her retirement on jan 3 against ex-dgp and former mumbai police commissioner sanjay pandey.

'Harassment of citizens'

'Lack of social sensitivity'



NEW DELHI: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee condemned the Special Intensive Revision going on in the state, alleging the process that was expected to be constructive has already claimed 77 lives while leaving multiple others needing hospitalisation.In her letter to the Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, the CM wrote, ""It is shocking that an exercise which should have been constructive and productive has already seen 77 deaths with 4 attempts to suicide and 17 persons falling sick and necessitating hospitalisation.""She further stated that the process was ""relentlessly harassing the ordinary citizens"" and that the revision of the voter lists is being done strictly on technical data without any human judgment.Mamata alleged that the ECI has undertaken the procedure without proper planning, which has caused fear and intimidation. ""This is attributed to fear, intimidation and disproportionate workload due to unplanned exercise undertaken by ECI,"" the CM wrote.‘77 deaths due to SIR’: Mamata makes explosive charges on EC again; flags ‘inhumane’ conditions""Mamata Banerjee attacked the ECI, claiming the revisions are subjecting the citizens to unreasonable pressure and administrative scrutiny. She wrote, ""I am deeply shocked and disturbed by the manner in which the Election Commission of India (ECI) appears to be relentlessly harassing ordinary citizens during the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR).""Highlighting the importance of human intervention and judgment in the process, she said that this revision forms the foundation of democracy and the constitutional framework.""The hearing process has become largely mechanical, driven purely by technical data and is completely devoid of the application of mind, sensitivity and human touch that are indispensable for an exercise of this nature-one that directly forms the bedrock of our democracy and constitutional framework,"" she wrote.In her claims, the Bengal CM, calling the practice ""lack of social sensitivity"" and ""grave insult to women"", alleged that many women voters who moved to their matrimonial homes are being questioned and summoned to prove their identity.The CM wrote, ""Women electors who have shifted to their matrimonial homes and changed their surnames after marriage are being questioned and summoned for hearings to prove their identity. This not only reflects a complete lack of social sensitivity but also constitutes a grave insult to women and genuine voters. Is this how a constitutional authority treats half of the electorate?""She also highlighted the names of prominent personalities like Amartya Sen, Joy Goswami, and Mohammed Shami, who have been asked to establish their credentials, calling it ""profound shame"".The letter ended with a handwritten postscript from the CM saying, ""Though I know you won't reply or clarify. But it was my duty to inform you the details.""On Monday, Mamata Banerjee had announced her plan to move to the Supreme Court over the ""inhumane treatment"" of the citizens during SIR.

Supreme Court Directs Dogs Be Shifted From Schools, Bus Stands To Shelters; Petitioner Breaks Down

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday continued hearing pleas seeking changes to its earlier order on stray dogs, with actor Sharmila Tagore appearing as one of the applicants through her counsel.The top court sharply pushed back against the submissions made on Tagore’s behalf, saying such arguments were “completely removed from reality.""Appearing for Tagore, counsel told the court that there cannot be a “one size fits all” solution when it comes to stray dogs on the streets. It said the issue must be looked at through science and psychology, adding that while the Animal Birth Control (ABC) rules may not be perfect, they need to be reviewed, not discarded.The counsel said the law already recognises a difference between normal street dogs and aggressive dogs and argued that some aggressive dogs can improve after treatment and behavioural care, though it accepted that aggression can return in some cases. Such dogs, he said, must be clearly identified by designated committees.When the Counsel cited example of a long-standing stray dog at AIIMS, the court said any dog living on the streets is likely to carry ticks and warned that allowing such animals inside hospitals could have “disastrous consequences”. The judges told the counsel not to romanticise the presence of dogs in sensitive public spaces.""Was she being taken to the hospital theatre also? Any dog that’s in the streets is bound to have ticks.And a dog with ticks in a hospital will have disastrous consequences. Do you understand? We’ll let you know the reality of what is being argued. You (the dog lover’s side) are completely removed from reality. Don’t try to glorify these dogs in the hospitals,"" the bench said.Suggestions like colour-coded collars to identify dogs with a history of biting were also raised by Tagore's counsel, citing examples from other countries. The court questioned the comparison and asked lawyers to remain realistic, pointing to differences in population size.The Supreme Court was hearing petitions seeking modification of its earlier directions in the stray dog matter.","The supreme court was hearing petitions seeking modification of its earlier directions in the stray dog matter.

2026 assembly elections: Survive or revive? Congress's alliance dilemma in states,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2026-assembly-elections-survive-or-revive-congresss-alliance-dilemma-in-states/articleshow/126451589.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress is gearing up for the latest round of electoral challenges in 2026. With assembly elections due in four key states - Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu , and Kerala, as well as one Union Territory, Puducherry - there is a lot at stake for the grand old party. The Congress is the principal challenger to the ruling dispensation in Kerala and Assam, while in Tamil Nadu, it will try to win a second term along with its ally, the DMK.2025 was a disastrous year for the Congress electorally. It could not open its account in the Delhi assembly elections, while it was reduced to its lowest score in Bihar.So, will 2026 see a change in the electoral fortunes of the Congress? Well, it all depends on how the grand-old party negotiates with its “grand-old problems.”And one of the biggest problems of the Congress in recent times has been its dilemma over alliances. The party, which successfully ran two coalition governments at the Centre between 2004 and 2014, has been struggling to get its alliance arithmetic right ever since it was pushed out of the ‘centre’stage of Indian politics by the BJP in 2014.A string of electoral defeats and the simultaneous winning spree of the BJP forced the Congress to join hands with parties that were once its political opponents in several states.And this perhaps explains why the grand-old party struggles when it comes to forming alliances. While on the one hand, the Congress wants to use coalitions to stay politically relevant, on the other, it also does not want to cede much space to the regional partners to ensure that it does not lose its political ground and influence. Torn between these two objectives, the Congress often finds itself juggling between “bullying”, “blackmailing” and “bargaining” to stitch alliances.2026 is unlikely to be any different, as the initial developments show. In Tamil Nadu, the Congress seems to be flexing its muscles with the DMK, with which it has had a stable alliance for a very long time, but is not part of the state government.Congress MP Manickam Tagore had set the stage for this arm-twisting earlier this week when he said that alliances remain the political reality in Tamil Nadu and the time has come to move beyond seat-sharing and initiate discussions on the sharing of power.However, with his statement leading to speculations on the future of the alliance, Manickam Tagore was quick to do damage control and said: ""Tamil Nadu is an important state, and we all know that the INDIA alliance is a significant alliance, with Congress being a part of it and the DMK as its major partner. We have contested eight elections together, as the DMK is a long-term ally of Congress.""Tagore’s remark was the second time that a Tamil Nadu Congress leader had spoken of the party joining the state government. Months ago, Killiyoor MLA S Rajeshkumar had said that the party legislators and office bearers would urge the All India Congress Committee to persuade the DMK to accept ""coalition government"" and allot more seats to the party.So, is the Congress-DMK alliance really under strain? Or is the Congress trying to use pressure tactics to renegotiate its position within the alliance?The emergence of Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) under Vijay as the third regional player in the state’s politics has made the game of alliances in the state interesting.Vijay has had a growing political presence in Tamil Nadu politics and the public response to his meetings and rallies has been impressive. The TVK chief has made it clear that he will not join hands either with the “corrupt” DMK or the “communal” BJP.While the party has kept the alliance cards close to its chest, a comment by its national spokesperson Felix Gerald triggered speculations about its preferences.""The Congress and TVK are natural allies in terms of secularism and their stand against communalism. In that sense, we have always been natural partners. Rahul Gandhi and our leader are also friends,"" Gerald had said.Later, when senior Congress leader and head of the party's Data Analytics Unit, Praveen Chakravarty, met TVK leader Vijay, it added fuel to the fire. While Chakravarty called the meeting personal, it did little to help end the speculations.The Congress perhaps wants to use Vijay’s TVK to increase its bargaining power vis-a-vis the DMK. But it should be careful of the flip side of these pressure tactics.History is replete with instances when Congress has suffered due to its botched alliance experiments.The most recent example is Bihar, where the Congress and the RJD could not come to an agreement on seat sharing even after the date for filing of nominations for the first phase was over. The fallout of this was that when RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav went to file his nomination papers, no Congress leader was by his side. Though the allies did manage to come to an agreement eventually, it was perhaps too late for them to pose any real challenge to the NDA.In Madhya Pradesh, the Congress refused to give seats to the Samajwadi Party, leading to an open war of words between the two parties. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav had then reacted strongly to the Congress’s move. However, the two parties eventually managed to iron out differences and contested the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in alliance in Uttar Pradesh.In Delhi, the Congress and Arvind Kejriwal’s AAP have been in and out of alliance several times. While they contested the 2024 Lok Sabha elections together, in the last assembly elections, they went all out against each other. Analysis of the results later showed that Congress played a key role in the defeat of AAP at the hands of the BJP, facilitating its return to power.In Maharashtra, the Congress has walked out of the opposition alliance Maha Vikas Aghadi and is contesting the civic polls alone. This was after the Thackeray brothers decided to join hands for the BMC polls and also the NCP factions scripted a union of sorts.In West Bengal, which also goes to polls in a few months, the Congress and Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress are allies at the national level under the INDIA bloc, but are bitter political rivals in the state. The two parties have made several unsuccessful attempts to reach an understanding. The ruling Trinamool accuses the Congress, which has been literally wiped out in the state, of being unreasonable in its demand for seats. The Congress, on the other hand, argues that complete surrender to Trinamool would mean that the doors for the party’s possible revival in future are closed forever.Clearly, in many of these states, the Congress seems to be stuck between the devil and the deep sea in terms of its choices. The party’s first predicament is to decide if it wants an alliance or wants to contest alone to start the process of revival. Once it decides on an alliance, the priority shifts to safeguarding its long-term interests by not conceding too much to the regional partner. This often results in protracted bargaining, bullying and even blackmailing. And at the end of all this, more often than not, the Congress ends up having egg on its face.So, the question is: Has the Congress learnt its alliance lessons? Well, we will have answers in the next few months.","The congress is gearing up for the latest round of electoral challenges in 2026.

Amit Shah Outlines Foolproof NIDMS Mechanism To Counter Future Terror Attacks

JAIPUR/JODHPUR: Union minister Amit Shah Saturday credited the Bhajan Lal Sharma-led BJP govt in Rajasthan with streamlining the recruitment system in the state, putting an end to the paper leak scandals, which he alleged had become a recurring feature during the previous Congress dispensation.Shah was addressing newly recruited police constables, while distributing appointment letters at the Rajasthan Police Academy. He said nearly 9,000 candidates were recruited, including over 2,500 women, and symbolically handed appointment letters to 10 constables.""Before coming here, I learnt about the entire (recruitment) process. I want to tell the people of Rajasthan that these 9,000 youths got jobs without paying anything, and without any recommendation, purely on merit and hard work,"" Shah said. He added that the recruitment process ensured transparency, eliminated corruption and respected skills.The home minister maintained that the 2025 constable recruitment examination was conducted transparently with the use of technology.Highlighting the challenges of policing in the state, which has a 1,070-km international border with Pakistan, rugged ravines and the Thar Desert, Shah urged the new recruits to undergo training with full dedication to contribute to the goal of a ""surakshit (safe) Rajasthan"".Shah said this would be the first batch to join Rajasthan Police after the introduction of three new criminal laws, and claimed that once the laws are fully implemented, any FIR registered will have a system in place for justice to be delivered up to the Supreme Court within three years.On the occasion, CM Sharma announced the establishment of Rajasthan Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (R4C) on the lines of Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) to tackle cybercrime. He said the R4C would be developed as a centre of excellence and provide a centralised framework for coordination, information sharing and research on cyber crimes across all districts.Addressing a convention in Jodhpur later, Shah praised the Maheshwari community for its sustained contributions to India - from the era of battles against Mughals through the freedom struggle and into post-Independence nation-building.","Shah was addressing newly recruited police constables, while distributing appointment letters at the rajasthan police academy.

Mamata Banerjee Hits Streets, Leads Kolkata Rally Against ED Raids

Multiple FIRs filed 'in malicious manner' against officers: ED

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has decided to move Supreme Court seeking remedy against the ""unfortunate action of West Bengal chief minister"" in obstructing the probe and tampering with evidence in a PMLA case against I-PAC, and a nod to continue with its probe against the political consultancy agency. The petition is likely to be filed late in the night or early Sunday morning.Lawyers aware of the developments told TOI that ED has, in its petition, accused the West Bengal police of actively acting under the directions of the TMC govt to thwart the probe into the money laundering case against I-PAC, by an FIR against the directorate officials to coerce them not to conduct investigations in the case.ED is trying to get the petition listed for Monday amid indications that the solicitor general may represent it if the Supreme Court entertains the plea.The West Bengal govt has already filed a caveat in SC to preempt ED from seeking and getting an ex parte order, amid its continuing political slugfest with central agencies which began with the state govt in Nov 2018, withdrawing general consent to CBI to investigate cases inside the state.ED, it is learnt, has argued that its attempt to raise its grievances before Calcutta HC was unsuccessful as unruly scenes during the hearing on Friday forced the judge to adjourn hearing on a case which required urgent interim orders to protect the sanctity of investigations.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also contemplating requesting Supreme Court to transfer the pending petitions, one by ED and the other by Trinamool Congress relating to I-PAC case, to Delhi high court to be in an atmosphere conducive to adjudication by a constitutional court.The agency had petitioned Calcutta high court on Friday to order a CBI probe against West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee , DGP Rajeev Kumar, Kolkata Police commissioner Manoj Varma and others for ""theft of digital and other evidence, wrongful restraint and confinement of central govt officers, and breakdown of the rule of law"".It said that multiple FIRs had been registered ""in a malicious manner"" against its officers for conducting an investigation under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) into the financial dealings of political consultancy I-PAC, which has been associated with TMC and the Bengal govt for years.The 28-page petition, filed in response to Mamata and the police brass's allegedly ""illegal and unconstitutional interference"" in ED's search of addresses linked to I-PAC, details how the Bengal CM and her entourage tailed the central agency throughout Thursday - from the Loudon Street residence of the firm's director Pratik Jain to its office in the tech hub of Salt Lake's Sector V.The petition alleges that Mamata entered Jain's residence around 12.05pm and ""took possession of all digital devices along with key incriminating documents"" from an ED officer, ignoring requests not to interfere with the investigation into I-PAC's alleged role in money laundering linked to a 2020 coal scam.At I-PAC's Salt Lake office, ED officers were ""obstructed"" while performing their duties as the CM and a contingent of Trinamool functionaries and workers refused to budge from there for nearly four hours, the petition stated.Countering the CM's allegation that Union home minister Amit Shah had sent ED to ""snatch"" documents and digital storage containing Trinamool Congress's poll plans under the garb of an investigation into I-PAC's dealings, ED informed the high court that its officials officially recorded the sequence of events in a panchnama.","The enforcement directorate (ed) has decided to move supreme court seeking remedy against the ""unfortunate action of west bengal chief minister"" the petition is likely to be filed late in the night or early sunday morning.

BJP Targets Mamata Banerjee Over ED Raid At I-PAC, Alleges Evidence Tampering

KOLKATA: Coinciding with its fight against ED over searches on I-PAC, Trinamool Congress released on Saturday a three-minute campaign song and music video titled 'Jotoi koro hamla, abar jitbe Bangla' (Attack as much you can, Bengal will win) to galvanise workers ahead of the Bengal elections this summer.The song has echoes of TMC's 2021 campaign theme, ""Bangla nijer meye-kei chaye"" (Bengal wants its own daughter), in a reference to chief minister Mamata Banerjee . This time, weaving ""Bengali asmita"" (pride) into its campaign narrative, the video outlines TMCs core campaign planks in the run-up to the polls.The video highlights attacks on religion and Bengali language, stressing that the political battle is also about ""saving Bengal's plurality"" both in religion and personal choices. Protests against attacks on Bengali-speaking migrants also feature in the clip.According to a TMC senior, two images spell out the narrative for party workers. One is Mamata's fighter perception, reinforced by a split-second image in which she transforms into a Royal Bengal tigress. The second is the positioning of black-and-a-white images of PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah - to mark out the key adversaries.The campaign this time is a repositioning of TMC's 2024 Lok Sabha election theme, ""Jonogoner Gorjon, Banglay BJP er Bisorjon"" (Roar of the people, BJP's ouster from Bengal), TMC's senior functionaries said.TMC had first used this theme ahead of the 2021 assembly elections, a contest that came with a series of firsts for Mamata.""This was the first time she contested from a seat outside Kolkata. It was the first time she had to deal with poll-eve defections on a large scale, including two senior ministers led by Suvendu Adhikari,"" a TMC senior said.Listing the other milestones, the senior pointed out that it was the first time that Mamata led an entire 50-day election campaign, ""not on her feet but on a wheelchair"" after she was injured in a pre-poll car mishap. ""It was the first time she had allowed a poll strategist to recalibrate her political strategy,"" the senior said, alluding to I-PAC founder Prashant Kishor.","The song has echoes of tmc's 2021 campaign theme, ""bangla nijer meye-kei chaye"" (bengal wants its own daughter) this time, weaving ""bengali asmita"" (pride) into its campaign narrative, the video outlines tmcs core campaign planks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126460307,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1384303,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
