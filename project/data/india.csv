"SC ends logjam: TN gets power to appoint, sack VCs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-ends-logjam-tn-gets-power-to-appoint-sack-vcs/articleshow/120111193.cms,"CHENNAI: Long-term constitutional consequences apart, the immediate impact of the Supreme Court's landmark ruling on the governor's duties and powers will be the end of stalemate over appointment of vice-chancellors to nine of Tamil Nadu's 22 state universities. Many of these universities have remained headless for more than two years as Raj Bhavan had been sitting on the bills.The AIADMK govt's Fisheries University Bill, which seeks to rename the university after the late former chief minister Jayalalithaa, too has been pending for more than four years.Also, these bills also empower the state govt to remove vice-chancellors on grounds of wilful omission or refusal to carry out the provisions of the law or abuse of powers vested in them. Nomination of members to Senate and Syndicate, besides academic councils of universities, will also become the sole prerogative of the state govt henceforth.""The bills have now become acts, and they would come into force once the state govt notifies them. The governor will not have any more role to play in the appointment of vice-chancellors to state universities,"" senior advocate and DMK MP P Wilson told TOI. The state can now proceed with the constitution of search panels for the appointment of VCs, he said.However, the governor will continue to be chancellor of universities, Wilson said, adding that he would be toothless as all powers, including conducting campus inspections, will be taken over by govt. ""Today's judgment has reiterated the fact that the power of the governor under the Constitution is limited. The governor does not have any vested constitutional right to be a chancellor of the university. The state can make any law that comes under the purview of its law-making power,"" said senior advocate K M Vijayan.As of now, Anna University, Bharathiar University, Bharathidasan University, Madurai Kamaraj University, Tamil Nadu Teachers Education University, Annamalai University, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University and Tamil Nadu Physical Education and Sports University have been functioning without vice-chancellors.Though the other universities may get vice-chancellor search committees, the University of Madras may have to wait a little longer as the amendment to the University of Madras Act, 1923 would need the President's assent. Now that the state has wrested the power to appoint VCs, educationists urged the state govt to take great care in nominating members to vice-chancellor search committees.",The supreme court's landmark ruling on the governor's duties and powers will be the end of stalemate over appointment of vice-chancellors to nine of tamil nadu's 22 state universities.

The HC had in 2019 quashed the FIR registered against them by holding that no offence under Sections 153A, 295A, 509 of the IPC was made out from the complaint but said that it would be appropriate to impose the costs of Rs 10 lakh each so that in future they may not mock a religious sect head just to gain publicity on social media.Quashing HC's order, the SC bench said, ""We are of the view that after finding that absolutely no offence was made out when exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 of the CrPC, high court ought not to have exercised advisory jurisdiction by telling the appellant that the contribution made by the priest was much more than what the appellant and the other accused have contributed. Function of the court is not to do moral policing"".""Perusal of the impugned judgment shows that the high court upheld the fundamental right of the appellant of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India.

"Appropriated by BJP, Congress tries to reclaim Patel legacy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/appropriated-by-bjp-congress-tries-to-reclaim-patel-legacy/articleshow/120108284.cms,"AHMEDABAD: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is learnt to have told party members that there should be no reservation in naming a group that is targetted, as he reiterated that Congress stands for all religions and groups.Rahul is learnt to have mentioned that a community, be it Christian, Muslim, Sikh, OBC or deprived classes, be named. He said Congress is not associated selectively with any group.The remark at the meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) reportedly came after some questions from party leaders about clarity on political strategy. It has been a subject of debate in political circles and in Congress on how to address the hard polarization pitch of BJP. Rahul stated he had no confusion about the strategy.The extended CWC, led by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul, met at the Patel Memorial here for around four hours to discuss the resolution that will be placed before the AICC session on Wednesday.Sources said the mention of the Palestine-Israel conflict also came in for suggestions from members. Some reportedly felt the passing reference about the Modi govt's silence on bombardment of innocents was not enough and required detailing. Rahul also pitched strongly for ""social justice"" issues like caste census, even as he rubbished that Congress could be confined merely to Dalits, minorities, as is the case in popular parlance.Many members gave their views on different aspects of the resolution. Sources said senior MP from Kerala Shashi Tharoor argued that Congress should not just criticize but should be constructive and should also offer alternatives and options. There was a discussion on US tariffs on India, and also the foreign policy. MP Manish Tewari, sources said, expressed strong views on the Chinese encroachment in the Ladakh region. Some also demanded greater emphasis on the waqf bill's criticism.While the resolution remains under the wraps, it is learnt that the document contains all the national issues, from alleged ""divisive politics"" and ""Hindu vs Muslim"" of the BJP-RSS to ""assault on the Constitution and federalism"", ""compromised foreign policy"" of Modi regime based on ""personal branding"", with references to US, Chinese encroachment, return of hardline in Bangladesh. A key reference is likely to be on social justice, with a focus on caste census and higher quotas, and Congress's role in the first Constitutional amendment of 1951 to safeguard reservations, implementation of Mandal commission and OBC quota in educational institutions, and Modi govt's ""dereservation"" drive through privatization and contractual employment.","Rahul is learnt to have mentioned that a community, be it christian, muslim, sikh, obc or deprived classes, be named.

In subsequent attacks, Banerjee did not spare Ray, and Kirti Azad, another TMC MP.In a no-holds-barred attack, Banerjee questioned how a woman MP could ask BSF personnel at Nirvachan Sadan ""to arrest him"" and refer to him as a ""chhotolok"". Banerjee also referred to Ray's role in the Narada sting tapes and hit out at Azad for ""advocating for a sweet shop"". He said he had complained to the party's ""top leadership"".The issue referred to the April 4 deputation by TMC MPs to EC on the duplicate EPIC issue. Party MP Mahua Moitra , who was to be part of the delegation, arrived there to find her name missing from the list of signatories.Banerjee claimed he did ""only as instructed"" and said he asked Moitra not to make it an issue. ""She shouted at me, and so did I,"" he added.""The allegations that I denigrated her (as a woman) and abused her are false. There can be heated arguments among colleagues too, that is not the issue, but she asked the BSF (posted at EC) to arrest me. How can she say that? I am in politics for 40 years. I have all along fought against CPM, Congress and now BJP. She only speaks of Adani-Modi and not against a single BJP functionary. I protested that strongly, and yes, I spoke loudly,"" Banerjee said.Moitra, in Nadia, couldn't be reached for comment. Since the controversy, she has not spoken about it in public.On April 4, Banerjee apparently wrote about this in a WhatsApp group that only TMC MPs have access to. On Tuesday, BJP's Amit Malviya, and later Bengal BJP, shared on X WA screenshots and videos on the incident.The videos showed Banerjee shouting at his colleagues while entering EC office as party netas tried to calm him down. In the WA chats, Banerjee was seen having a tiff with Azad with the former referring to an unknown ""versatile international lady."" In the purported chats, Banerjee had posted a message saying he had reached Kolkata.Then he added, ""Send your BSF and Delhi Police to arrest me. Your home ministry connection is very strong international great lady.""If this was the first trigger for Banerjee's outburst, the second was Ray when he confirmed the BJP allegations. Ray told reporters Banerjee should be removed as the chief whip of TMC in LS. ""But I leave it to Mamata Banerjee's judgment. That Kalyan is not fit to be in the post is apparent to me. I've not said it so far, but because of his behaviour and his incorrect English...

Waqf Act amended to neutralise changes made by Congress for 'appeasement': PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/waqf-act-amended-to-neutralise-changes-made-by-congress-for-appeasement-pm-modi/articleshow/120107903.cms,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi

, everyone else will benefit from Waqf Act: Modi

NEW DELHI: PM Modi Tuesday aggressively defended the amendments to the Waqf Act, asserting these were necessary to neutralise the changes made by the Congress-led UPA as part of "" politics of appeasement "", which primarily served the interests of fundamentalists and land grabbers, and had also led to India's Partition.""The 2013 changes placed the interests of... land mafia above the Constitution and effectively shut out avenues for justice for their victims,"" the PM said as he referred to the appropriation of plots belonging to govt, churches, temples, gurdwaras and farmers by declaring them waqf property. The new law, which came into force on Tuesday, aims at rectifying these issues, he said.The PM made these remarks at the ""Rising Bharat Summit"" organised by News-18 Group.The PM's comments came on a day govt filed a caveat in the challenges filed by Islamic clerics and others, and a day after SC announced it would soon set a date for hearings.Commending Parliament for passing the legislation to protect common Muslims, Modi said, ""At the core of the controversy surrounding the Waqf Act is the politics of appeasement; its seeds were sown before independence. Other political parties empowered radical elements through waqf protests and also encouraged land mafias. Pasmanda Muslims and everyone else will benefit from this law.""""Many colonies gained independence but did anyone have to pay the price of dismemberment for freedom?"" he asked. The PM said, ""Very few countries got their independence through partition. But it happened to India because politics was kept above national interest.""In a reference to the widespread allegation about the misuse of the waqf law, especially because of the provision in the 2013 law that the designation of a property as waqf asset could not be challenged in a civil court, the PM said, ""The law was meant to be an instrument of justice but it became a source of fear instead and gave rise to a false sense that it was above the Constitution.""Asserting the amended Act is ""in the interest of society and the Muslim community"", he highlighted the democratic process behind the legislation, noting that Parliament passed it after a debate lasting over 16 hours - the second-longest debate in its history.In additional, he said, ""Over 1 crore people shared their views with the joint parliamentary committee (on the waqf bill)"", which had sought public opinions online. ""Democracy is no longer contained within the four walls of Parliament; it is strengthened with the participation of the people.""Modi said politics of appeasement was at the root of the debate over the issue of waqf and it brought Congress to power and some Muslim fundamentalists became rich. ""But, the moot question is what benefits did the ordinary Muslims get? What did the poor Pasmanda Muslims get? They were only subjected to neglect. They did not get education, they faced unemployment and Muslim women faced injustice like Shah Bano, where their constitutional rights were sacrificed at the altar of fundamentalism,"" Modi said.The PM said a similar attitude led to the country's Partition in 1947, when Congress leaders did not wipe out the idea of a separate nation that was nursed by ""some fundamentalists"" and not ordinary Muslims, and Congress succumbed to their pressure for ""lust of power"".","Prime minister narendra modi aggressively defended the amendments to the waqf act.

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress MP Saugata Roy on Tuesday said he saw Mahua Moitra in tears following a spat with party colleague Kalyan Banerjee outside the Election Commission office last week, and urged that Banerjee be removed from his position as the party’s chief whip in the Lok Sabha over repeated ""uncivilised"" conduct.“I was not there when this altercation between Kalyan Banerjee and Mahua Moitra took place. I was at Vijay Chowk and the spat took place in front of the Election Commission office. I saw Mahua crying and complaining to several MPs, of other parties also, about Kalyan's behaviour,” Roy told reporters in Kolkata, according to a PTI report.According to a PTI source from TMC, the spat occurred on April 4 when a party delegation went to the Election Commission to raise the issue of duplicate voter ID numbers. Following the meeting, the group also marched to Parliament.Kalyan Banerjee had been tasked with getting TMC MPs to sign a memorandum to be submitted to the EC. Moitra reportedly confronted him after discovering her name was not included among the signatories and slammed him for it outside the EC office, reported PTI.A war of words ensued. Kalyan Banerjee later alleged that Moitra had even asked security personnel at the EC office to arrest him.Roy said Moitra had not spoken to him directly, but told another MP about Kalyan Banerjee’s behaviour. “She said that he (Banerjee) behaved in an uncivilised manner,” he said.Taking a sharp dig at Kalyan Banerjee, Roy said, “I feel it is beneath my dignity to reply to whatever Kalyan Banerjee may have said. His uncivilised behaviour had been in our focus several times.”He cited a string of past incidents: “He called (Union Minister) Jyotiraditya Scindia ‘lady killer’ and later apologised to him. During the JPC meeting on Waqf, he broke a bottle and threw it at the chairman of the panel. Kalyan is known for his intemperate and uncivilised behaviour. So far, I did not speak about it because it’s beneath my dignity. I heard from you that he has said things against me and that’s why I have replied.”Roy said Kalyan Banerjee was not fit to serve as the party's chief whip in the Lok Sabha. “That Kalyan is not fit to be on the post is apparent to me. I have not said it so far, but because of his behaviour and his incorrect English. But now, I think the time has arrived to see into it,” he said.“I do not expect Kalyan to uphold my dignity. I think I can do that... I have been in Parliament for five years, in Assembly for another five and these are pretty long tenures for people to judge. I don't want Kalyan Banerjee's certificate. Let him learn his English first,” Roy added.He said he would leave the final decision to party supremo Mamata Banerjee: “But I leave it to Mamata Banerjee’s judgment.”Meanwhile, BJP leader Amit Malviya shared purported screenshots of a WhatsApp group of TMC MPs, showing Kalyan Banerjee clashing with party MP Kirti Azad. The screenshots suggested that Kalyan Banerjee had referred to Moitra in veiled terms, calling her a “versatile international lady”.In one message, Kalyan Banerjee allegedly wrote: “Send your BSF and Delhi Police to arrest me. Your home ministry connection is a very strong international great lady.”Another message read: “Today I congratulate the gentleman who opened the beautiful activities of a versatile international lady. That day not a single boyfriend of hers stood behind her. This foolish man whom she wanted to arrest by BSF, stood behind her. Today of course 30 years famous player stood behind her to get me arrested.”Kirti Azad, in response, could be seen asking Kalyan Banerjee not to act like a “juvenile delinquent.”An undeterred Kalyan Banerjee continued his tirade, reportedly calling Azad the “captain of... internal politics” and further wrote: “Your popularity is so much that you lost election in cricket. Let me see your power to get me arrested for your friend. Do not worry I will go to Durgapur and open your musk (sic).”According to another TMC source, tensions between Kalyan Banerjee and Azad had flared earlier as well — over something as mundane as a proposal by Azad to open a stall selling sandesh, a Bengali sweet, in Parliament. Kalyan Banerjee reportedly objected to the idea unless it was a franchise of the West Bengal government.","Trinamool congress mp sougata roy said he saw mahua moitra crying after a spat kalyan banerjee. ‘he behaved in an uncivilised manner,’ says roy.

A third is on the run.Police said they were acting at the behest of an ISI-backed terror module involving Zeeshan Akhtar, an associate of jailed gangster Bishnoi, and Pakistan-based Shahzad Bhatti.BJP neta Manoranjan Kalia, who was at his Jalandhar home when the grenade attack occurred around 1.03am on Tuesday, initially mistook it for a transformer blast.It was only when he saw dust and smoke in the courtyard that the BJP functionary realised something was amiss.The ex-minister's Innova, a parked motorbike, an aluminium door and some glass windows were damaged in the explosion.""I called the commissioner of police and the ACP, but they did not take my calls. So, I sent my security guard to the police station barely 300 yards from my home to report the blast,"" Kalia said.Suspected mastermind Zeeshan, whose roots are in Shankar village of Jalandhar's Nakodar subdivision, is an accused in the Oct 12, 2024 murder of former Maharashtra minister and NCP functionary Baba Siddique in Mumbai.He is also a suspect in a March 16 grenade attack on the house of UK-based social media influencer Navdeep Singh Roger Sandhu's in-laws in Jalandhar's Raipur Rasoolpur. On that occasion, the grenade didn't explode.Bhatti named Zeeshan and gangster Happy Passia, who is believed to be based in the US and has links with Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) terrorist Harwinder Rinda, as his accomplices in the attack targeting the house of Sandhu's in-laws. He accused Sandhu of producing social media content denigrating Islam.In June 2024, a purported video call between Bhatti and Bishnoi surfaced online, reinforcing suspicions about their collaboration. This Feb, another video showed Zeeshan addressing Bhatti as ""an elder brother"" and thanking him for assisting in his escape from India.A senior police officer said Zeeshan was possibly in Europe.Before allegedly orchestrating the grenade attack on Kalia's residence, Zeeshan had at least 10 criminal cases filed against him between Sep 3, 2021, and March 16 this year for offences ranging from murder to violation of the Arms Act. Zeeshan, whose aliases include Mohammad Jaseen, Jaisy Silander and Jazzy, is 21 and has served time in jails in Punjab.At a presser in Chandigarh, Punjab's special DGP (law & order) Arpit Shukla said police cracked the grenade attack case within 12 hours. He said investigators were verifying leads about the suspects having links with Pakistan-based BKI and gangster Happy Passia.An FIR was registered under sections 109 (attempt to murder), 324 (3) (mischief causing loss or damage to any property) and 61(2) (criminal conspiracy) of the new penal code BNS and the Explosive Substances Act.BJP and AAP jousted over the attack on Kalia's home, with the saffron party demanding CM Bhagwant Mann's resignation. BJP workers staged a protest in Patiala to condemn the attack. Minister Mohinder Bhagat, who visited the BJP national executive member's house, blamed the Union govt for ""activities orchestrated by Lawrence Bishnoi from jail in collaboration with Pakistan"".Late Tuesday, Praveen Kumar Sinha, a 1994-batch IPS officer and additional DGP, was named as Punjab's new intelligence chief. The home department's order mentioned that incumbent Jaiswal's new posting would be announced later.","Two suspects, identified as jalandhar residents harry and satish kumar, alias kaka, were arrested on charges of lobbing the grenade at manoranjan kalia's house from an e-rickshaw.

SC sets timeline for state governors to decide on bills sent to them,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-sets-timeline-for-state-governors-to-decide-on-bills-sent-to-them/articleshow/120107361.cms,"Constitution doesn’t let guvs exercise absolute veto: SC

NEW DELHI: Frowning upon the Tamil Nadu governor for acting in violation of constitutional provisions by sitting on bills forwarded to him after being passed by the state assembly, Supreme Court, in an extraordinary and first-of-its-kind decision, held that 10 bills reserved by the governor be deemed to have been assented by him, and fixed a timeline for Raj Bhavans to decide on giving or denying nod to bills passed by state legislatures in a time-bound manner in order to prevent what happened in Tamil Nadu.As the Constitution restricts itself to saying that the governor has to act ""as soon as possible"" but does not prescribe any timeline, a governor can delay the decision on assent, a prerequisite for a legislation to become law, for months. The court said if assent was to be given, then it has to be done within a month. The court set a timeframe of three months in case a bill is sent to the assembly for reconsideration or to the President. In case a bill is re-sent after reconsideration by the assembly, the governor must grant assent in a month. The court also said any breach of the timeline could be challenged in court. In Tamil Nadu's case, one bill has been pending for over five years.While saying that the Tamil Nadu governor had acted in violation of constitutional provisions by sitting on bills, a Supreme Court bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan on Tuesday said he had shown “scant respect” to various verdicts of the apex court and did not act with bona fides while referring the bills to the President after it was re-sent by the state assembly after reconsideration. It held that governor has no option but to give assent once the bill has been sent back to him after reconsideration by the assembly. The Constitution does not allow him to exercise “absolute veto” or “pocket veto” by indefinitely delaying decision on bills, the bench said.Reading out the operative part of the verdict, Justice Pardiwala, who penned the judgment, said as per Article 200 of the Constitution, governor has only three options when a bill is placed before him — grant assent, withhold it and send it back for reconsideration, or reserve it for the President. It said a bill could be reserved for the President only at the first instance and not when it was sent after reconsideration by the assembly.“As a general rule, it is not open for the governor to reserve a bill for the President after the bill has been re-presented by the govt after being passed again by the assembly. The only exception is when the bill presented in the second round is different from the first version,” Justice Pardiwala said.On Tamil Nadu governor’s contention that he could withhold assent to bills without sending them back to the assembly for reconsideration, the court said such an option was not available under the Constitution.“Withholding of assent or reservation of bills for the consideration of the President, after their due reconsideration by the state legislature, being in contravention of the procedure prescribed under Article 200, is declared erroneous in law and thus hereby set aside. As a result of the above finding, any consequential steps that might have been taken by the President on these 10 bills is set aside,” the bench said.“Having regard to the unduly long period of time for which these bills were kept pending by governor, before the ultimate declaration of withholding of assent, and in view of the scant respect shown by the governor to the decision of this court in ‘State of Punjab’ (case), and for other extraneous considerations that appear to be writ large in discharge of his functions, we are left with no choice but to exercise our inherent powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to declare these 10 bills to have been deemed to have got assented,” it said.","Constitution doesn’t let guvs exercise absolute veto: sc.

'He misbehaves and insults everyone'

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has an onerous task at hand. The Trinamool chief needs to identify the black sheep in the party who leaked videos and purported chats of an ugly spat between her senior MPs - first at the office of Election Commission and then on the WhatsApp group of the party MPs.Mamata and her party have been left embarrassed after BJP leader Amit Malviya shared story of alleged infighting between leaders of the Trinamool Congress along with video clips and WhatsApp chats on his X handle.Read also: Feud within TMC? Kalyan Banerjee blames Kirti Azad for leaking 'infighting' WhatsApp chats The BJP leader claimed that two Trinamool MPs had a public spat in the precincts of the Election Commission of India on April 4, 2025 - the day a Trinamool delegation had gone to the EC office to submit a memorandum.""It all started after one MP, who was carrying the memorandum, went to the EC office directly ignoring party's instruction to first meet other members of the delegation at party's Parliament office to get the document signed by all of them. This angered the other MP, who confronted him when they came face to face at the commission office,"" Amit Malviya wrote in his post on X.""Later the fight continued in the ‘AITC MP 2024’ WhatsApp group with MPs trading barbs at each other,"" he added.Read Also: 'Just because she speaks fluent English ...': Kalyan Banerjee blames 'woman MP' for public spat The leaked video shows a visibly agitated TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee taking out his anger while other party leaders try to pacify him and calm him down.Kalyan Banerjee continues with his rant even when prodded that the media is watching his actions. ""So what! I want the media to see this,"" says Kalyan Banerjee when he is warned about media presence. The TMC MP goes on to say that he will not tolerate such things as he has not come through quota or from any other party.Then the fight spilled on to the WhatsApp group of the Trinamool MPs where Kalyan Banerjee and Kirti Azad - who joined Mamata's party in 2021, engage in an ugly spat.Ironically, the purported WhatsApp conversations not just brings to fore the infighting within the party, but also indicate that not two but three MPs were involved in the incident.In the chat, Kalyan Banerjee refers to a ""versatile international lady"" and makes several strong comments on her. When Kirti Azad confronts him, he vents out his anger against him.Later, speaking to reporters in Kolkata, Kalyan Banerjee admitted that an altercation did take place, but pinned the blame on a woman MP - whom he did not name.""I have been in politics for the last 40 years. This woman MP was asking the security personnel outside the EC office to arrest me. Who are they to send me to jail? She hurled abuses towards me. It is I who fight in Parliament; I am not someone who is only obsessed with a specific industrial house,” he said.""Just because the woman MP speaks fluent English doesn't mean she can insult anybody,” added Kalyan Banerjee, who is also the party's chief whip in the Lok Sabha.Following the altercation, the woman MP exited the WhatsApp group and sent letters to both Mamata Banerjee and TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, news agency PTI said citing sources.A senior TMC leader, who requested anonymity, told PTI the argument occurred last week when a party delegation had gone to the EC to submit a memorandum.“After the TMC delegation arrived at the EC office, Kalyan Banerjee had a verbal spat with the woman MP over the signing of the memorandum. She then asked the security personnel to intervene and demanded his arrest, alleging misconduct towards a woman parliamentarian,” he said.The matter further escalated when Kalyan Banerjee and Kirti Azad had an argument on the MPs' WhatsApp group.""It was Kirti Azad who provoked me and was lecturing me on what to do. He has leaked the WhatsApp chats,"" Kalyan Banerjee claimed.Reacting to the controversy, senior TMC MP Sougata Roy blamed Kalyan Banerjee for tarnishing the party's image.“What he has done has maligned the party. Party should immediately remove Kalyan Banerjee from the post of chief whip. He misbehaves and insults everyone in the party. It must take stern action against him,” Roy told reporters.Roy also said that he saw Mahua Moitra crying after the spat. ""I was not there when this altercation between Kalyan Banerjee and Mahua Moitra took place. I was at Vijay Chowk and the spat took place in front of the Election Commission office. I saw Mahua crying and complaining to several MPs, of other parties also, about Kalyan's behaviour.""Clearly, for Mamata Banerjee, who is gearing up for the assembly elections next year, this public display of infighting within the party is the last thing she would want. More so, when the school jobs scam has already given the BJP a strong weapon to nail her and the Trinamool.",Bjp leader amit malviya shared story of alleged infighting between leaders of the trinamool congress along with video clips and whatsapp chats on his x handle.

"'Shadow cabinet, Seva Dal': Sanjay Jha's 5-point prescription for revival of Congress",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shadow-cabinet-seva-dal-sanjay-jhas-5-point-prescription-for-revival-of-congress/articleshow/120099394.cms,"Rahul Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge and Sonia Gandhi at CWC meet in Ahmedabad.

Five recommendations for the Congress to reform itself:

1. Announce a shadow cabinet

2. Decentralise Congress

3. Create a model state of development and governance

4. Make Seva Dal strong

5. Make the CWC relevant

NEW DELHI: The Congress Working Committee is meeting in Ahmedabad to chalk out party's roadmap for upcoming assembly polls and decide on slew of measures for the much-needed organisational reforms. The grand old party, which themed its Ahmedabad session as ""Nyaypath: Sankalp, Samarpan aur Sangharsh"", on Tuesday asserted it's claim to Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel's legacy with Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge accusing the BJP and RSS of trying to usurp it under a ""well-planned conspiracy"" against the national heroes.But will that be enough to counter the BJP?The Congress has seen a steady decline in its political fortunes since 2014. After a decade of disappointments, the 2024 Lok Sabha elections offered a glimmer of hope as the party nearly doubled its tally in the Lower House. However, the cheer was short-lived as the Congress put up a dismal show in several assembly elections in a row - Haryana, Maharashtra and DelhiSo, what does the Congress need to do to change its political fortunes and prevent this slide. Former party leader Sanjay Jha, who writes ""Congressi by DNA"" in his X bio, has a prescription for the revival of the grand old party. In an exclusive interaction with TOI.com, Sanjay Jha shares a 5-point action plan to rejuvenate the Congress.The Congress must announce a shadow cabinet - just like the leader of the opposition is supposed to be a shadow Prime Minister. The shadow cabinet should name people for at least key portfolios like home, defence, foreign policy, agriculture, industry, finance, HRD etc. If that is done, it will give a massive advantage because people will be able to compare the incumbent govt with what could be the potential cabinet of the opposition govt.More importantly, they can always take on the media and the public can ask questions to the shadow cabinet on policy issues like tariffs and foreign policy. These are the things Congress needs to seize the initiative.Congress is too strongly focused on Delhi-centric president model. This is a big country. It is not easy to run with one president supported by general secretaries of each and every state or a few states. Instead, there should be five vice-presidents for different regions - North, East, West, South and a separate one for North East because it is a very complex area and needs separate attention.These VPs will report directly to the president and the general secretaries within these of diferent states can report to the vice president. This is how Congress will become a lot more focused, it will have a lot more empowerment within the leaders running the party across the country and will open opportunities for people like Sachin Pilot, DK Shivkumar, Shashi Tharoor, Randeep Sujrewala and Manish Tewari who are just not leveraged at all at present.The Congress party needs to create a model state of governance and development - perhaps any one where they are in govt at present like Karnataka, Telangana or Himachal. The party can create a model to tell the people that this is how we run a state.Create a parameter on investment, law and order, job creation, no corruption - basically how it is very citizen friendly and how it has been able to make the youth more successful with startups, ability to extract funds, law order, development and transparency.They create a model state that they can take it across the country to say 'give us a chance and we can make the entire country similar to this.' This is what BJP did with Gujarat, even though it was a fake model, it impressed people and that brought them to power in 2014.The Congress has neglected this very, very crucial organisation that it has. The party should actually put good talent, make a young man the head of it and make sure that the Seva Dal becomes what the RSS is to the BJP.Its ability to work in crisis situations, pan out across communities in India, reach farmers, do household campaigning and actually do social work and not just political, work in areas that require more support. Become a bridge like a political NGO that works between the common people of India, the communities and the political parties that represent them in the parliament.The Congress Working Committee has got too many people in it, it has too many invited members especially guests. It has really become a place where you give people reason to feel promoted or happy and basically used to distribute goodies here and there.The CWC has to be a criticial-thinking organisation that should take all the big calls about alliances, big policy issues and should not be left to a handful of people to make big calls. That is the only way to stop a caucus or coterie to emerge.All the big decisions of the Congress should be left with the CWC where it should be a body of not more than 22 or 24 people. Meeting should not be held for over 25 people.Reduce the bureaucracy, don't make it too unwieldy to manage. These 24-25 people should be having decision-making ability to even tell the president that they don't agree with you. And if the majority of CWC does not agree with the decision, the president should not enforce it.This is how transparency will be built. CWC needs overall restructure - it needs new faces and needs a completely dynamic team of people - some elected, some bright and intellectual and some not even elected but having a core ideology but more importantly, CWC should become the crucial body to run the entire party.","The congress working committee is meeting in ahmedabad to chalk out party's roadmap for upcoming assembly polls.

NEW DELHI: A defiant V Senthil Balaji , who was reappointed as minister in the M K Stalin govt after being released on bail, has told Supreme Court that he could continue to be part of the Tamil Nadu cabinet because ""he enjoys popular mandate and he cannot be chastised for seeking a political office in pursuance of the popular mandate"".Responding to the court's query on how he could take charge of a ministry immediately after being granted bail as his holding the post could influence witnesses, Balaji, who is facing serious corruption charges , asserted that courts could not read into the Constitution a disqualification in appointment of a minister.In an affidavit, the TN minister said he had been scrupulously following bail conditions fixed by the court and no case was made out to recall the order granting him bail. Opposing the contention that his continuation as minister may influence witnesses in the case, he said, ""The entirety of criminal prosecution (state as well as by ED) came to be instituted against Respondent No.2 (him) while he was a minister in power and he even suffered adverse judicial orders. If the alleged influence of the minister was so strong, the prosecution would not have come to be launched and continued against him.""The case takes on significance as ministers in many other govts, including former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, held on to their positions during the period they were in jail. Balaji's affidavit further said, ""Even this court was acutely aware of the magnitude of the scheduled offence trials, and that they would take many years to conclude, and by its own estimation, at the very least three to four years or even more. Therefore, any exercise to modify the bail conditions would necessarily have to consider that Respondent No.2 enjoys popular mandate and he cannot be chastised for seeking a political office in pursuance of the popular mandate. This would not only be contrary to the popular mandate but would also be violative of his cherished right under Article 21 of the Constitution to participate in public life.""Balaji said there was not even a whisper of violation of any bail condition meriting interference by the court and the contention of influencing witnesses was specifically argued before and addressed by the SC in its judgment while granting him bail. He said he had been appearing before the trial court on every date after his release on regular bail and there was no ground whatsoever to suggest that he was either delaying the ED trial or attempting to influence any witnesses.","V senthil balaji was reappointed as minister in the m k stalin govt after being released on bail.

If the governor agrees with the Bill, a decision must be made within one month.

If the governor wants to return the Bill for reconsideration, it must be done within three months.

If the Bill is to be sent to the President, that must also happen within three months.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday criticised Tamil Nadu governor RN Ravi, saying that a governor cannot withhold assent to Bills passed by the state assembly or use an absolute veto or pocket veto.The court said the governor acted against the law by not approving 10 Bills that were passed again by the assembly after being returned earlier. The court declared these Bills as passed.""Governor must give assent to a bill when a bill is presented to him after re consultation in state assembly and he can only refuse assent when the bill is different. Action of governor to reserve the 10 bills for the president is illegal and arbitrary, and thus the action is set aside. All actions taken by governor thereto for the 10 bills are set aside. The 10 bills shall be deemed to be clear from the date it was re presented to the governor,"" the Court said.A bench of Justices JB Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said the governor did not act in good faith. They pointed out that the Bills were kept pending by the governor for a long time and then sent to the President shortly after the Supreme Court's judgment in the Punjab governor’s case, which had made it clear that governors cannot withhold assent by simply not taking any action on Bills.The apex court was delivering judgment on petition filed by the Tamil Nadu government against governor RN Ravi's refusal to grant assent to several bills passed by the state legislative assembly, including those concerning the appointment of vice chancellors to state universities.The judgment written by Justice Pardiwala said that the Constitution does not allow for an ""absolute veto"" or ""pocket veto."" According to Article 200 of the Constitution, the governor has three options when a bill is presented—grant assent, withhold assent, or reserve the bill for the President. The Court clarified that a bill can be reserved for the President only the first time it is presented.""Neither pocket veto or absolute veto is there in the constitutional scheme behind article 200.. this article 200 uses ""shall declare"" so that there is no scope of inaction and the governor has to adopt one of three courses available to him. Governor cannot sit on bills and excercise pocket veto over them,"" the SC said.The Supreme Court said the governor’s action of not giving assent to 10 Bills — with some pending since January 2020 — and then sending them to the President after they were passed again by the State Legislature was ""illegal and erroneous"" and should be set aside. Any step taken by the governor after that was also set aside.In its order, the court also fixed time limits for governors to act on Bills:The court said that if a governor does not follow this timeline, their decision can be challenged in court.The court said a governor should follow the Constitution and respect the decision of the state assembly, not act based on political reasons.Quoting B R Ambedkar, the court said, “However good a constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it happen to be a bad lot. However bad a constitution may be, it may turn out to be good if those who are called to work it happen to be a good lot.”Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin welcomed the Supreme Court's verdict, hailing it as 'historic'.""The Constitution mandates Governor to approve the bills once adopted for the second time but he didn't...he was also delaying..."" Stalin said, adding that the state government moved the SC against this.The SC accepted the state government's just arguments and ruled ""it has to be considered as the Governor having given his assent and gave the historic verdict,"" Stalin said.","Supreme court criticises tamil nadu governor rn ravi.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday quashed the CBI probe ordered by Calcutta high court against those responsible for preparation of a note based on which the West Bengal cabinet had allowed creation of supernumerary posts for appointment of teachers in May 2022 and said attaching criminality to cabinet decisions would be devastating for the country's federal structure.""How can one attach criminality to a cabinet decision when no appointment has been made pursuant to the decision?"" asked a bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar.The CJI said, ""How can a central investigating agency investigate a cabinet decision of a state? Will it not defeat the entire purpose behind federalism? There are clear provisions under Articles 74(2) and 163(3) which bar inquiry into any cabinet decision.""The same bench on April 3 had quashed the recruitment of over 25,000 teachers and teaching staff to govt and aided schools, calling it ""tainted beyond repair"".It said the cabinet note clearly mentioned that certain appointments were made illegally by the WB Schools Services Commission, and it was clarified that the decision to create supernumerary posts for appointment of teachers was subject to the outcome of the litigation challenging the recruitment process, which was pending before the HC.On May 19, 2022, based on the cabinet decision, and after approval from the governor, the state had issued a direction for creation of supernumerary posts. This was not challenged before the HC nor was a prayer made seeking probe by the police or CBI into the creation of supernumerary posts, the bench said.""The May 5, 2022, note records that the power under Section 19 of the WB School Services Act, 1997, is being issued in respect of waitlisted candidates, but the same shall be subject to the outcome of the pending litigation before Calcutta HC.The cabinet decision was taken at a time, which was accepted (by the governor), when there was pending litigation in the HC regarding the possibility of finding tainted candidates,"" it said. The May 5 note mentioned the view expressed by WBSSC that there were wrongly appointed candidates because of various irregularities and nothing was hidden, it said. HC was not justified in directing CBI probe into the preparation of the cabinet note, the bench said and referred to Art 74(2) and 163(3), which specifically bar courts from inquiring into cabinet decisions advising the President/governor.Senior advocates Maninder Singh, Bikas Ranjan Bhattacharyya and Rauf Rahim attempted to show, from the application filed by the state before Calcutta HC stating that supernumerary posts were created with the sole purpose of accommodating candidates who did not figure in either the merit or wait list. The bench said this argument was wrong as the cabinet note did not say this at all. It mentioned that the supernumerary posts would be subject to the outcome of litigation pending before the HC.Singh said the decision was a colourable exercise of power and hence would not be protected by provisions of Art 74(2) and 163(3). But the bench disarmed him by asking whether the petitioner had made a prayer for police or CBI inquiry into the cabinet note? If it was not made, then it could not be raised for the first time before the SC, the bench said.","Sc: hc not justified in asking cbi to probe cabinet note preparation.

The appointment letters issued by both banks had specified that any dispute between the parties leading to legal action must be resolved before a competent court in Mumbai.When they were terminated in 2016 and 2017 respectively, they challenged their terminations before courts in Patna and Delhi. HCs concerned gave rulings holding that the employees could challenge their terminations before the court where they were posted prior to severance of service.Writing the judgment, Justice Datta said, ""...The right to legal adjudication cannot be taken away from any party through contract but can be relegated to a set of courts for the ease of the parties. In the present dispute, the clause does not take away the right of the employee to pursue a legal claim but only restricts the employee to pursue those claims before the courts in Mumbai alone.""",Supreme court said private employers can validly include a clause in appointment letters restricting employees to a court in a particular city/town for raising any legal dispute relating to employment.
