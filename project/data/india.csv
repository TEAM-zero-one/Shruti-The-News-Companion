BENGALURU: While Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) lit up Chinnaswamy Stadium with high-octane cricket action Saturday, drama of a different kind unfolded off the pitch - right inside the elite Diamond Box. The families of two high-ranking govt officials, one a senior IPS officer and the other an income tax commissioner, clashed over who was entitled to which seat!The clash of egos quickly spiralled into a full-blown showdown, turning the VIP box into a war zone of words and tempers. The duel escalated so dramatically that it spilled beyond the stadium and landed both parties at Cubbon Park police station, turning the cricket fever into a criminal case. The IPS officer's family charged the income tax commissioner's family with intimidation, sexual harassment and outraging modesty, which the latter has denied.""But what's more shocking is it all took place in the complimentary hospitality box even as several senior govt officials watched without intervening,"" a senior cop said. The incident happened when the IPS officer's daughter and son were at the seating area enjoying the game. ""The daughter stepped away to use the washroom, leaving her purse on the seat to indicate it was occupied. That is when a man came and occupied her seat. When the brother told him to vacate as his sister was all set to return, the man did not budge and an argument broke out between the two. Soon, the sister joined her brother while the man was joined by his wife, the income tax official, and their son. The argument intensified with each hurling abuse at the other. At one point, the confrontation between the IPS officer's daughter and the man almost went out of control as the man was arguing in her face,"" the cop elaborated.The brother-sister duo called their parents, who were watching the match at home on television. The IPS officer and his wife rushed towards the stadium, and worried about their children, called senior police officers in the city to intervene. With no help coming, the IPS officer's wife told her kids to move out of the stadium as she rushed to Cubbon Park police station and lodged a complaint. She accused the man ""of making unwelcome physical contact and intruding on her (daughter's) privacy with an intention to offend her"". She stated that visuals of the rowdy behaviour of the man was captured by her son on his mobile phone. She also pointed out that there were no cops on duty in the Diamond Box when the incident took place, between 9.40pm and 10.20pm.Based on her complaint, police registered a case against two unknown persons under BNS Sections 351 (criminal intimidation), 352 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 75 (sexual harassment which includes physical contact involving unwelcome overtures), and 79 (insulting a woman's modesty).After two hours, the man in question and his wife were summoned to the police station, and they were later allowed to leave. When contacted, the police brass chose not to comment and claimed necessary action would be taken after investigation. A police officer claimed helplessness, stating: ""One is a senior IPS officer and another is a senior income tax officer, we are in a spot.""","'no cops on duty in box' as families of two high-ranking govt officials clash over who was entitled to which seat.

"Maternity payout covers just 20% of births, claim activists",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maternity-payout-covers-just-20-of-births-claim-activists/articleshow/120912531.cms,"NEW DELHI: Right to Food activists have expressed concern over barely 20% of births each year being covered by govt's maternity benefit scheme, despite the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, guaranteeing Rs 6,000 as legal entitlement of all pregnant women.Data given to RS in March showed that only 54 lakh beneficiaries were paid in 2024-25, much lower than almost 73 lakh in 2022-23, but an improvement over 22.5 lakh beneficiaries in 2023-24. The estimated number of births per year in India is 270 lakh.Giving maternity benefit of Rs 6,000 per child for 90% of the 270 lakh births would require an annual expenditure of over Rs 14,500 crore. However, the allocation for the maternity benefit scheme, Prime Minister's Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), has stagnated below Rs 2,000 crore in the last few years. The entitlement has not been revised since 2013, which means in real terms it has gone down after adjusting for inflation. Even by a very conservative estimate, maternity benefits should have been raised to at least Rs 12,000, argued the Right to Food activists.In April 2017, the women and child development ministry told Supreme Court that all pregnant women would receive Rs 6,000 under Section 4 of the NFSA. But instead, the PMMVY was implemented, reducing the benefit to Rs 5,000, restricting it to the first child (or second if it's a girl), and imposing multiple conditionalities.To get Rs 3,000 (first instalment), pregnancy must be registered and one ante-natal check-up done within six months at an approved facility. For Rs 2,000 (second instalment), childbirth must be registered and the child vaccinated with the first cycle of immunisations.Eligibility is limited to disadvantaged women who must prove it with documents like ration or BPL cards. Further, women below age of 18 years and seven months are not eligible. Many documents are required, including Aadhaar card, Aadhaar-mapped bank/post office account details, mobile number, eligibility proof, Mother and Child Protection card or Reproductive and Child Health card, date of last menstrual period, date of ante-natal check-up, child's birth certificate, and child immunisation details.Due to these conditions, most women are excluded. In 2023-24, only 2.7 lakh women (about 1%) received the second instalment. In contrast, Tamil Nadu and Odisha provide Rs 18,000 and Rs 10,000 per pregnancy, with 84% and 64% birth coverage respectively.","Right to food activists have expressed concern over barely 20% of births each year being covered by govt's maternity benefit scheme.

NEW DELHI: Limited flushing and desilting of reservoirs of two run-of-the-river hydro-power projects - Baglihar and Salal - on the Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir—are being undertaken by India in an immediate move to prepare them for storing and regulating flow of water to Pakistan during the winters. More dams will undergo the process in coming days to ensure better storage in India.The move is part of the country’s detailed roadmap, prepared after suspension of the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) following the Pahalgam terror attack last month, to prevent and regulate flow of western rivers - Indus, Jhelum and Chenab - to the neighbouring country.Flushing is a process to clear sediments from the reservoir by operating it in a particular way using high water flow whereas desilting can be done through dredging to remove large deposited sediment.“Since the Treaty is on pause and there is no obligation to follow its provisions, we may do flushing on any project without any obligation. It will ensure longer effective life of such projects,” Kushvinder Vohra, former chairman, Central Water Commission, told TOI.He said typical projects like Baglihar and Kishanganga with smaller live poundages may complete the flushing process in about one to two days.Desilting/flushing of reservoirs is part of short-term measures under the roadmap whereas expediting under construction hydro-power projects such as Pakal Dul (1000 MW), Ratle (850 MW), Kiru (624 MW) and Kwar (540 mw) would be the medium-term measure.Curbing flow of nine cusecs of water from Kishanganga as required as per earlier award and using it for production of more power for India would be another measure that can be taken up in short-term, Vohra said.There are four more power projects which are in the pipeline as long-term measures which will make it possible for India to utilise adequate water from the western rivers using accompanying reservoirs. These projects will not only increase India’s hydro-power capacity in Jammu & Kashmir from nearly 4,000 MW to over 10,000 MW but also increase the water storage capacity which can be used in the UT and neighbouring states.Other measures under the roadmap include taking up Tulbul project on Jhelum which was stalled earlier; works on Wuller lake and Jhelum for better flood management; lift projects which may take comparatively lesser time to use water; and adequate use of existing Ranbir and Pratap canals to ensure more water for Jammu region.“Many other things can also be done which may unfold at an appropriate time,” said Vohra.","Flushing and desilting of reservoirs of two run-of-the-river hydro-power projects - baglihar and salal - on the chenab river in jammu and kashmir.

Don’t want to reserve any judgment: Outgoing CJI

NEW DELHI: CJI Sanjiv Khanna on Monday passed the baton to incoming CJI B R Gavai for deciding the validity of the contentious Waqf Amendment Act, 2025, and said certain points and figures about waqf properties raised in the affidavit filed by the Centre to oppose the plea for pausing the law needed detailed hearing even for the purpose of passing interim orders.Heading a bench also comprising Justices Sanjay Kumar and K V Viswanathan, CJI Khanna at the outset, with the consent of counsel for the rival sides, referred the bunch of petitions challenging the Act to CJI-designate Gavai and fixed hearing for May 15, a day after the new CJI takes oath. CJI Khanna retires on May 13.CJI Khanna told solicitor general Tushar Mehta that the court had gone through, even if not minutely, the Union govt’s preliminary response to the petitions. “The govt has raised certain points with regard to registration of land (for a valid waqf) and some figures about waqf properties. These require some consideration. There are some aspects, which require clarification also,” he said.Mehta said the govt had answers to every apprehension expressed by the petitioners and that the Act was intended to benefit individuals in the Muslim community and streamline the management of huge waqf properties. Lead counsel for the Muslim side, senior advocate Kapil Sibal who had pressed for the law to be stayed, responded sarcastically, “He has an answer for everything.”The CJI brought this to an abrupt end by informing the counsel that he did not want to reserve any judgment, or even an interim order for that matter.Tushar Mehta said govt had answers to every apprehension expressed by the petitioners and that the Act was intended to benefit individuals in the Muslim community and streamline the management of huge waqf properties.

On April 17, Mehta had pre-empted the SC from staying certain provisions of the law by assuring that the Centre would make no appointments to the Central Waqf Council and Auqaf Boards and maintain status quo on waqfs, including ‘waqf by user’, already registered or declared under the Waqf Act, 1995.Defending the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025 as a secular law, Centre in its 1,332-page response, which included 1,100 pages of documents, had said the objection to mandatory registration of waqf properties, including ‘waqf by user’, was baseless as it had been in vogue for more than 100 years. It had also given data about huge increase in waqf properties in the last 12 years. All India Muslim Personal Law Board , in its rejoinder affidavit, accused Centre of misleading the SC by giving figures of properties which though were part of waqf prior to 2013 but had not been entered in the centralised portal, Waqf Management System of India.","No stay, next cji b r gavai to decide waqf act validity.

Show material to link C’garh scam accused to proceeds of crime, SC tells additional SG

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday flagged what it called the Enforcement Directorate making allegations against accused in money laundering cases without backing them with evidence, and said it has witnessed this trend in many cases.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan expressed concern over the investigating agency not substantiating its claims with material to link the accused with proceeds of crime . ""This is what we have seen in umpteen number of cases filed by the ED. This is the pattern, just make allegations without reference to anything,"" the court said. Additional solicitor general S V Raju responded to the remark by saying he would submit evidence to ""dispel the court's impression"" that the agency had been filing cases without having necessary evidence.The court made the observation while hearing the bail plea of one of the accused in the Chhattisgarh liquor scam case, Arvind Singh, after it was not convinced with the agency's submission linking the accused with Rs 40 crore proceeds of crime. Raju said Singh was involved in the multi-crore liquor scam.Additional solicitor general S V Raju said Chhattisgarh liquor scam case accused, Arvind Singh, was involved in the multi-crore liquor scam and he was instrumental in procuring empty liquor bottles through a company Anurag Traders. The ASG said he was running a parallel liquor business in the state causing a scam of over Rs 2,000 crore.The bench asked the ASG to show material to link Singh with the company and with Rs 40 crore proceeds of crime unearthed by the agency. When the court noted that Singh was neither managing director nor director nor held any post in the company, Raju said he was indirectly managing the affairs of the company.As the bench seemed unconvinced, Raju, who was arguing online, sought time to appear in court and place relevant documents to substantiate the allegations against Singh and dispel the bench's impression that allegations were made without proof.Pressing for bail, senior advocate Siddarth Agarwal said his client had already spent 10 months in jail and trial was unlikely to commence in the near future as the probe was still on. He said there were 21 accused in the case and documents running into 25,000 pages had been filed with over 150 witnesses named.Raju, however, said bail could not be sought on ground of filing of voluminous documents and probe was complete on Singh's role. He said the accused had not spent one year in jail, a timeframe considered by the court for granting bail. The bench, however, said there was no such yardstick that bail could be granted only after an accused had spent one year in custody.Interestingly, while speaking at ED's foundation day a few days ago, Raju, who has been the agency's main counsel, cautioned ED not to rush to arrest an accused and said it should be done at a later stage (of investigation) after making a watertight case. ""Gather evidence before arrest and make sure the accused has been linked to 'proceeds of crime' rather than the predicate offence alone,"" he had said. If an accused was arrested at an early stage of investigation, it may not meet the requirement of the law and the accused may get relief from courts, he had suggested, adding that extracting confessions and collecting evidence were easier before an accused was arrested for alleged money laundering, rather than after his arrest. ""Material evidence can be gathered when ED is still investigating a case, so get evidence before arrest. Don't be in haste in arresting,"" he had said.","The court made the observation while hearing the bail plea of one of the accused in the chhattisgarh liquor scam case, arvind singh.

NEW DELHI: Sultana Begum , who claims to be the geat-granddaughter-in-law of the last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar , broke down in disappointment on Monday after the Supreme Court dismissed her plea seeking possession of the Red Fort .The court, led by Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar, dismissed her petition as “completely misconceived.” The bench said, “Why only Red Fort? Why not Fatehpur Sikri? Why leave them also.”The ruling came as a final blow to Begum, who has spent years trying to reclaim what she says is her rightful ancestral property.Speaking to ANI news agency with visible emotion, she said, ""I did not mention Lal Qila (Red Fort), I only sought possession of Bahadur Shah Zafar's house. I don't know whether it is Lal Qila (Red Fort), Zafar Mahal or Fatehpur Sikri...that the government knows...I was hopeful that I would get justice from the SC, but today that hope has shattered. Now, where should I go? Should I go and beg now or defame him? What should I do? Bahadur Shah Zafar did so much for his nation; he sacrificed his son, his crown was taken, but he never betrayed his country...I got an offer of help from so many countries, but I said that I will not leave my nation. I am completely shattered after this...Those who betrayed their country are living a lavish life, and the man who was loyal to his country, his family is suffering today...There is no one to listen to us...I denied the public's help because I had faith in the SC. But now, when no options are left, I will get help from the public...""Begum had approached the apex court after the Delhi high court rejected her plea in both 2021 and 2024. The high court had cited an “inordinate delay” of over 150 years in bringing the matter to court.In her petition, Begum said that the Red Fort was taken from her family after the 1857 revolt against East India Company , when the British exiled Bahadur Shah Zafar and seized control of the property.She claimed the central government is now the “illegal occupant” and sought either possession or financial compensation for its use since 1857.Begum also stated that her late husband, Mirza Muhammad Bedar Bakht - believed to be the great-grandson of Zafar - was officially recognised by the Nehru government in 1960 and granted a political pension. She married him in 1965 and received a pension after his death in 1980.Now, with the Supreme Court closing the door on her legal claim, Sultana Begum says she has no choice but to turn to the public for support.","Sultana begum claims to be the geat-granddaughter-in-law of the last mughal emperor bahadur shah zafar.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday modified an order by Bombay high court to constitute a special investigation team (SIT) under Lakhmi Gautam, the joint commissioner of police, Mumbai, to probe allegations against policemen in the Badlapur 'fake' encounter case and directed Maharashtra's director general of police (DGP) to supervise the probe.Seeking modification of HC order, solicitor general Tushar Mehta , appearing for the state, told a bench of Justices Bela M Trivedi and P B Varale that the govt has no issue with the constitution of the SIT but submitted that it should be under the supervision of the DGP. Allowing the plea, the bench modified the high court's direction and said Maharashtra's DGP will constitute an SIT to probe allegations against five policemen for the custodial death of Badlapur sexual assault case accused Akshay Shinde.Shinde, accused of sexually assaulting two minor girls at a school in Badlapur in Thane district, was allegedly shot in a police van on September 23, 2024, when he was being taken to Kalyan from the Taloja prison for questioning in another case.Supreme Court said, ""...it is directed that the SIT shall be constituted by the DGP consisting of officers as he may deem appropriate."" It aso directed the state CID to hand over papers to the DGP in two days.Bombay HC had ordered an FIR against five policemen and the setting up of an SIT under the supervision of JCP Lakhmi Gautam . Modifying the high court's direction, the apex court said the Maharashtra DGP would constitute the SIT which would continue the probe.Since Shinde's father, who had moved the HC for an SIT or CBI probe into the death, had withdrawn himself from the proceeding before the HC, the SC bench decided not to issue a notice to him. ""We may clarify that the complainant, if he has any grievance, may approach the competent court i.e the magistrate concerned or sessions court as the case may be for appropriate relief,"" the judges said.","Sc allows dgp to oversee sit in badlapur death case.

""How long can this go on,"" he asked.The bench of Justices Kant and N Kotiswar Singh perused the ACRs of Prem Kumar, who was a direct recruit to the post of additional district and sessions judge in Punjab in 2014, and said his track record and integrity was termed good by the supervising judge. However, it suddenly dipped to poor with 'doubtful integrity' in the next year only to dramatically improve to good both in performance and integrity criteria.The rollercoaster evaluation of performance and integrity became routine for Prem Kumar and in April 2022, the HC in administrative side dispensed with his services.To safeguard his dignity, Kumar challenged his dismissal before the high court through a writ petition.In January this year, a division bench of the HC allowed the writ petition, quashed the full court's march 7, 2022, recommendation as well as the order of April 20, 2022 dismissing him from service. The HC appealed against the division bench's order before the SC.Dismissing the appeal, Justice Kant-led bench said, ""Just because he belongs to a lower caste, he is being targeted. It is a big problem in the high court. The HC should be fair in treating its judicial officers.""The bench ordered Prem Kumar's immediate reinstatement in service with deemed seniority, full arrears of wages and dropping of vigilance inquiry.","Supreme court derided systematic targeting of a senior judicial officer just because he was a cobbler's son.

Cop becomes 1st ‘candidate’ acquitted in Vyapam case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cop-becomes-1st-candidate-acquitted-in-vyapam-case/articleshow/120910851.cms,"BHOPAL: In a blow to Madhya Pradesh's Special Task Force (STF), a CBI special court in Bhopal has delivered the first-ever acquittal of a 'candidate' named in the infamous Vyapam scam - India's largest recruitment and exam scandal that has engulfed over 3,000 accused, including students, officials, and middlemen.The lone acquitted candidate, 32-year-old Sajan Singh Thakur , is a police constable posted at Kotwali police station in Harda. A native of Damaria village in Seoni Malwa tehsil of Narmadapuram district, he was accused of fraudulently securing his post by using a proxy to appear in the 2013 Professional Examination Board (PEB) recruitment test.The case against him was initiated in Oct 2021, when a confidential complaint reached the additional director general of police, STF Bhopal, alleging that Thakur paid Rs 5 lakh to a proxy exam-taker - referred to as a 'Munna Bhai' - with financial help from his brother, Pappu Thakur.STF investigators collected Thakur's handwriting and fingerprints, retrieved original recruitment documents, and sent them for forensic analysis. The prosecution claimed there were discrepancies, indicative of impersonation.An FIR was registered in Dec 2022, and Thakur was arrested in March 2023. He was granted bail while the trial progressed. A chargesheet was submitted before the special court in Aug 2024, and he was subsequently suspended.On May 2, 2025, the CBI special court dealing with Vyapam cases ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove charges beyond reasonable doubt. Citing inconclusive forensic results, lack of eyewitness testimony, and unproven elements of conspiracy and intent, the court acquitted Thakur.Speaking to TOI after the judgment, advocate Gopesh Sikkewal, counsel for Thakur, said, ""The prosecution was unable to provide substantial explanations on several technical issues during cross-examination. Since he has been acquitted of the charges, we will be filing a petition to get him reinstated in the police force, along with all financial benefits that he deserves till date.""The court ordered Thakur's acquittal under IPC sections 419, 420, 467, 468, 471, 120B, and provisions of the MP Recognised Examinations Act, 1937. His bail bond was cancelled, and a copy of the judgment was sent to the Bhopal district magistrate. The prosecution is likely to file an appeal in the case.This case is among hundreds tied to the Vyapam scam, a massive network of exam fraud that rocked Madhya Pradesh, involving the rigging of entrance exams for medical colleges, govt jobs, and professional courses. Over the past decade, the scam has exposed a nexus of candidates, impersonators, officials, and politicians - undermining public trust in the recruitment process and triggering national outrage.","Sajan singh thakur, 32, is a police constable posted at kotwali police station in harda.

: Seven people, including three medical students and a doctor, were arrested in Rajasthan and Bihar for being involved in impersonation fraud in NEET-UG, conducted on Sunday, while a woman in Kerala was taken into custody for handing over a fake admit card to a student.Jaipur police busted a racket involving dummy candidates and hi-tech cheating devices, and arrested five people, following information received from the special operations group.A raid at an apartment in Jagdamba Nagar in Karni Vihar led to the arrest of Ajit Kumar and Sohan Lal Chaudhary, both postgraduate students of National Institute of Ayurveda in Jaipur, and Jitendra Sharma, a first-year MBBS student from Karnataka with a background in Ayurveda. Police seized counterfeit admit cards, AI-edited photographs, Bluetooth earpieces, SIM cards and Rs 50,000 cash, which was allegedly received as advance payment.Two candidates, Rohit Gora and Sanjay Chaudhary, were taken into custody later for being involved in the plan.DCP Amit Kumar, who led the operation, said the racket was masterminded by the two PG students, motivated by the prospect of quick money. Sharma was allegedly prepared to impersonate Gora in NEET and Chaudhary in an upcoming paramedical test.In Bihar, Dr Ranjit Kumar, a doctor posted at Begusarai jail, and Rambabu Malik, a resident of Darbhanga, were arrested in Samastipur district on Sunday for being part of a cheating operation that involved tampering with admit cards and sending proxies to take the exam on the behalf of the candidates.""Two people were found sitting near an exam centre in a suspicious manner, and were questioned. On checking their mobile phones, we found the admit cards of several students.

Greeshma, a resident of Thirupuram, admitted during questioning that she accepted a payment of Rs 1,850 from the student's mother, who had approached the centre to apply for NEET, but failed to submit the application on time. When the student followed up, asking for the admit card, Greeshma got one forged to cover up her negligence.The forgery came to light when an invigilator at the Pathanamthitta exam centre noticed inconsistencies in the admit card.The student, who was arrested and questioned, told police that the admit card was handed over by the Akshaya Centre employee.","Jaipur police busted a racket involving dummy candidates and hi-tech cheating devices.

She is expected to travel on Tuesday to strife-scarred pockets of Samsherganj and Suti.Mamata also alluded to last month's Pahalgam terror attack in which 26 tourists, including three from Bengal, were killed. ""Please take care of India's international borders instead of facilitating communal violence. Please take care of India. Please give justice to those who have lost their dear ones,"" she said, referring to the J&K carnage.Mamata then took a dig at the ""acting PM"". While she did not name anyone, she had in recent weeks accused Union home minister Amit Shah and his department of failing to stop people from across the Bangladesh border entering Murshidabad and stoking tension. ""I have seen all of them (PMs) from close quarters as an MP. I am not talking about the PM now but the 'acting PM'. Who is the acting PM? I do not know. Perhaps the BJP can answer. I will tell him, take care of the borders instead of creating communal tension,"" Mamata said.The CM pointed out that teams of BJP, NHRC and others had come to Murshidabad in the aftermath of the violence and alleged that no such visits were made to other trouble spots, including strife-scarred Manipur. ""You (BJP) came here the very next day after the incident (on April 13). NHRC came here but did not go to Manipur in two years. Nor did they go to Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha, Bihar or Delhi,"" Mamata alleged.The CM accused BJP of ""taking away"" the family of riot victims Haragobinda and Chandan from their home two days before her visit.

MUMBAI: Observing that a parent suffering from mental illness is not per se disqualified from custody unless it is shown to endanger the child's welfare, a sessions court dismissed a man's plea to take custody of his 16-year-old son. The man had filed an appeal against a magistrate awarding custody to the mother.""...It is evident that the magistrate interacted with the child, considered the best interest and welfare of the minor, and directed the parties to undergo mediation before passing the order. The magistrate, while granting temporary custody, considered the curriculum course of the child and the natural affection of the mother in the right prospect,"" the judge said.The judge said it is well settled in matters of custody that a minor's welfare is paramount and not parents' legal rights. ""...The minor is nearing adulthood, and the order is only for temporary custody...The magistrate did not commit any jurisdictional error or perversity warranting interference.""The mother had filed a complaint against the father under Domestic Violence (DV) Act in 2022. In March and April this year, orders were issued granting temporary custody of the son to the mother till May 15, and the father was directed to present him in court in Mumbai every month after visitation. A production warrant was also issued following the father's alleged failure to produce the child.The father's counsel said the magistrate's order was passed without giving him a fair opportunity to be heard, thus violating the principle of natural justice. The appeal also said the lower court failed to prioritise the child's welfare, who was already in the father's care in Patna, where he is studying in Class 11. The father's counsel questioned the magistrate's jurisdiction under DV Act to issue such custody orders and said there was no change in circumstances warranting a transfer of custody. Concerns were also raised about a potential trauma to the child due to the sudden change in custody without proper assessment.The mother's advocate highlighted the father's alleged non-compliance with the initial custody order and that he filed the appeal only after the production warrant was issued. Allegations regarding the mother's mental health were dismissed as unsubstantiated and defamatory, with a medical report presented as evidence of her sound mental state. The court was also told that the father had previously filed a transfer application before the chief metropolitan magistrate, which was rejected in Dec 2024, and that he had not complied with similar custody directions in the past.The sessions court found no evidence to support the father's claims that the magistrate ignored the child's academic commitments or that the mother has a mental illness.",A sessions court dismissed a man's plea to take custody of his 16-year-old son.

BHUBANESWAR: An Odisha govt probe has dismissed allegations that surplus wood from Puri Jagannath temple had been used to craft idols at the newly consecrated Jagannath shrine in Bengal's Digha, with officials attributing the controversy to a servitor's 'slip of tongue' in a television interview.Servitor Ramakrushna Dasmohapatra, who attended the Digha temple's inauguration, had claimed during a TV interview in Kolkata that he used surplus wood from the 2015 Nabakalebara to craft the Digha shrine idols.""We got it investigated by the Shree Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA) and found no truth in his claim. Dasmohapatra was summoned and asked by SJTA. Dasmohapatra admitted that it was a slip of tongue,"" law minister Prithiviraj Harichandan said.The minister confirmed that SJTA officials spoke to temple craftsmen, who verified that excess wood was not taken out of the Puri shrine for the construction of Digha temple idols.An investigation revealed that Dasmohapatra had commissioned a Bhubaneswar-based artisan for the Digha idols. The SJTA's questioning of the artisan confirmed that he had sourced neem wood from a timber supplier for the project.""Dasmohapatra's lies and wayward media statement hurt the sentiments of devotees. It is now officially clear that our temple's surplus wood was not taken outside for any other purpose. Dasmohapatra has been asked to submit a written explanation. He is likely to face action (possible suspension for some days) as per the temple act,"" a SJTA official said.Minister Harichandan also announced enhanced security measures for Daru Ghara (where surplus wooden logs are stored) inside the shrine. ""In 1995-96, following a faulty govt decision, the Daitapati Nijog had stored some surplus wood in their office within the temple premises. Now, we have decided to streamline the system. A committee has been set up to count the leftover wood in Daru Ghara and Daitapati Nijog's office.

Will bring SOPs for Jagannath temples outside Puri: Odisha

BHUBANESWAR/KOLKATA: Odisha government threatened on Monday legal action against Bengal for naming a newly inaugurated Jagannath temple in Digha as ""Jagannath Dham"", escalating an already bitter row that now spans religious tradition, regional pride, and political rivalry.Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee hit back, accusing BJP-governed Odisha of ""jealousy"" and of targeting Bengalis, while social media campaigns flared with hashtags like #BoycottPuri and #BoycottOdisha.Odisha law minister Prithiviraj Harichandan declared that ""Dham"" can only be associated with four sacred places - Badrinath, Dwarka, Rameswaram, and Jagannath Puri - and said using it for Digha has ""created anguish among devotees everywhere"".""We will also ask Bengal to stop referring to the beach near the Digha temple as Mahodadhi, a term found in scriptures describing the beach at Puri,"" Harichandan said.Puri's titular king and Lord Jagannath's chief servitor Gajapati Dibyasingha Deb condemned the use of the term ""Jagannath Dham"" for the Digha shrine, which was inaugurated on April 30. He said the term is exclusive to Puri. Citing ancient scriptures and Muktimandapa Pandit Sabha, Deb urged Digha temple authorities to ""desist from calling it Jagannath Dham"".Odisha announced it would introduce SOPs for all Jagannath temples outside Puri, defining the roles of servitors after some participated in the Digha temple's consecration - a move seen by many in Odisha as a breach of sacred tradition.For her part, CM Banerjee lashed out at Odisha and other BJP-governed states, accusing them of hostility and discrimination. ""When Mamata Banerjee builds skywalks at Dakshineswar or Kalighat, nobody raises a question. When I celebrate Durga and Kali puja, there's no outrage. Then why this animosity over Jagannath Dham?"" she asked. ""Why is there so much jealousy?""Speaking in violence-hit Murshidabad, Banerjee accused Odisha of ""thrashing"" Bengali-speaking people and said Bengalis are being assaulted in several BJP-governed states, including Maharashtra, Bihar, and UP.""You are attacking our migrant workers for speaking Bengali but we will not do the same. That is the difference between you and me,"" she said. ""We have reached out to Odisha, Bihar, and Rajasthan. Our DGP has spoken to Odisha's DGP. Our chief secretary is writing to the Union home secretary. I hope good sense prevails.""TMC MP and former cricketer Yusuf Pathan claimed that 20,000 Bengali workers fled Odisha after recent assaults - a charge Odisha revenue minister Suresh Pujari dismissed, advising Pathan to ""stick to cricket commentary"". Odisha police reported no complaints of such attacks.Banerjee reminded Odisha of Bengal's support during natural disasters. ""You seek engineers from us during cyclones. Bengal sends the maximum number of tourists to Puri. So why the outrage if we build a Jagannath Dham in Digha?"" she asked.Odisha government earlier notified that people should not visit the Digha temple, a move Banerjee condemned. ""We all visit Puri, but never ask questions. Why is this bothering them so much?"" she said. ""I love Puri. I love Odisha.

It cannot be allowed to go on like this (reserving judgments and forgetting about it),"" Justice Kant said.The Jharkhand HC registrar general's report, without mentioning the four appeals, said division benches had reserved judgments in as many as 56 matters between Jan 2022 and Dec 2024, but no final order had been passed yet.Single judge benches had reserved orders in 11 cases between July-Sept 2024 in which verdicts were yet to come.The court also referred to a newspaper report which said that Jharkhand high court had disposed of 75 appeals within a week of the apex court order of April 23 seeking details of four cases in which judgments were reserved without pronouncing judgments.The bench sought details of the 75 appeals disposed of in a week and soft copies of the judgments. It also asked the high court to inform about the fate of the four appeals, which advocate Shakil had mentioned.Expanding the ambit of adjudication from Jharkhand to all high courts, the bench asked registrars general of all 25 high courts to submit within four weeks reports on cases in which division benches and single judge benches had reserved verdicts before Jan 31 and were yet to pronounce verdicts.However, it decided to hear the Jharkhand related issue on May 11 while asking the Jharkhand Legal Services Authority to take immediate steps to find out those who have not been able to appeal against conviction in Supreme Court because of the HC indefinitely reserving orders on their appeals.",Sc bench seeks details of 75 appeals disposed of in a week by j'khand hc.

The report details the sequence of events after the fire incident and the mysterious disappearance of cash captured in a video shot by first responders.However, there was no information about the nature of the voluminous report or its findings. The report is learned to have annexed statements of over 50 witnesses examined by the panel.The witnesses included the Delhi police commissioner, the Delhi Fire Services chief who had given contradictory statements, some Delhi high court staff, the first responders to the fire as well as the security personnel deployed at the judge's residence.Eight days after the incident, the CJI had constituted a panel comprising Punjab & Haryana chief justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Justice Anu Sivaraman to conduct an inquiry into the allegations against Justice Varma. Under the memorandum of procedure, the CJI is the sole authority to decide the course of action depending on the contents of the report even though the panel's findings are not binding. If the report is adverse to Justice Varma, who has since been repatriated to Allahabad HC, the CJI could order lodging of an FIR for a formal investigation by police.The CJI, if he thinks fit, may also recommend to Union govt to initiate removal motion against the judge in case the panel has recorded specific findings of wrongdoing and his prima facie involvement in stashing of cash in the outhouse of his residence that caught fire.If the panel detects no evidence of wrongdoing on part of judge, then, too, the CJI could order a formal investigation or decide to close the case and allow Justice Varma to resume judicial work, which has been withdrawn since March 22.The fire broke out at 11.30pm on March 14. Delhi Police commissioner informed Delhi HC CJ D K Upadhyay the next day at 4.50pm, who in turn informed the CJI on March 16. Police also handed over to the Delhi HC CJ photos and videos of burning cash inside a room.Later, CJI Khanna uploaded the video of burning cash to SC's official website. He also asked Justice Varma not to delete any data from his personal phones. In his response to the HC CJ, Justice Varma had said, ""I unequivocally state that neither I nor any of my family members had stored or kept any cash or currency in that storeroom at any point of time. What baffles me is the absence of any sacks of allegedly burnt currency which were ever recovered or seized.""","Panel's findings not binding, ball now in cji's court.
