"Biren quits as CM of Manipur, assembly session suspended",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/biren-quits-as-cm-of-manipur-assembly-session-suspended/articleshow/118099815.cms,"Governor change hinted at Biren power shift

GUWAHATI: Manipur CM N Biren Singh's defiance of repeated resignation calls over his handling of the ethnic conflict raging there since May 2023 ended Sunday when he put in his papers on eve of the assembly's budget session, and a possible no-trust motion by Congress against the BJP-led government.Governor A K Bhalla accepted Biren's resignation and asked him to continue ""till alternative arrangements"". Late Sunday, the governor's secretariat notified that its Jan order summoning the assembly session stands ""null and void"" with immediate effect.The buzz around his resignation grew after Biren flew to Delhi, his second trip in a week, late Saturday. After a lengthy meeting with home minister Amit Shah on Sunday - BJP chief J P Nadda was also present - he returned to Imphal along with BJP's Northeast coordinator Sambit Patra.The closest that Biren had come to stepping down before this was on June 30, 2023, when a crowd of supporters, most of them Meitei women, waylaid his convoy en route to Raj Bhavan. An elderly woman then dramatically snatched his resignation letter and tore it to shreds.Over the next 19-odd months, the footballer-turned-politician would brave mounting pressure from within and outside BJP to quit as Manipur vacillated between violence and short-lived calm.As fissures within BJP deepened over the continuing conflict, Biren found himself in an increasingly vulnerable position.Last Nov, majority of BJP legislators, including those from the Meitei community, abstained from an emergency meeting convened by him to assess the situation in the wake of more violence attributed to tribal militants. Meghalaya CM Conrad Sangma’s NPP, a BJP ally, withdrew support to govt specifically over Biren’s handling of the conflict. Sangma said his party would reassess its stand if there was a change at the helm.In Manipur’s 60-strong assembly, NDA bloc consists of 37 BJP legislators, six from NPP, five of NPF, one from JD(U) and three Independents. Congress has five MLAs and Kuki People’s Alliance two. One seat fell vacant with the NPP incumbent’s death.The first signs of Biren’s position getting weaker came after Bhalla, a former Union home secretary, was appointed governor last Dec. Speculation about a change intensified last week with talk of a no-trust move.In his resignation to the governor, Singh said, “It has been an honour to serve the people of Manipur thus far. I am extremely grateful to central govt for time actions, interventions, developmental work and implementation of various projects for safeguarding the interests of every single Manipuri.”","Governor change hinted at biren power shift.

NEW DELHI: Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh submitted his resignation to Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla at the Raj Bhavan on Sunday. Singh, who was accompanied by 14 BJP and NPF MLAs, had just returned from Delhi before making the move. State BJP president A Sharda and senior BJP leader Sambit Patra were also part of the delegation.Singh's resignation comes amid growing political tension, with the opposition Congress pushing for a no-confidence motion against his government. Just a day earlier, he had convened a meeting with BJP-led alliance MLAs to discuss the upcoming assembly session, set to begin on February 10. In his letter to the governor, Singh expressed gratitude for the central government's interventions and developmental initiatives, stating that it had been an honour to serve Manipur.In 2023, Singh found himself at the centre of a political storm when he attempted to resign following intense pressure over the state's ongoing ethnic violence. The resignation drama, was marked by protests and a torn letter.Thousands of supporters, mostly elderly women, blocked his convoy as he attempted to reach Raj Bhavan. Singh got down from his vehicle and tried to convince them, but they refused to budge, forcing him to return home. The six-hour-long demonstration outside his residence culminated dramatically when cabinet minister L Susindro Meitei read out Singh's resignation letter in front of the crowd, only for the women to snatch it from his hands and tear it apart.The build-up to this political drama began when women protesters at Ema Market issued an ultimatum to the government to end the unrest following a deadly gunfight between security forces and rioters. Hours later, tensions escalated as mobs vandalized BJP offices in Thoubal and Imphal West. Early the next morning, Singh held a meeting with his ministers, where the decision to resign was takenEventually, he was forced to clarify on social media that he would not be resigning. ""At this crucial juncture, I wish to clarify that I will not be resigning from the post of chief minister,"" he posted on Twitter.At the time, security forces had been stretched thin, dealing with both the protests and violent clashes between Meitei and Kuki communities. The state had been placed under strict restrictions, including internet shutdowns, to prevent the spread of inflammatory content. As the situation escalated, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi visited Manipur and met with Governor Anusuiya Uikey, appealing for peace, stating that violence was not the solution.","Manipur chief minister n biren singh submitted his resignation to governor ajay kumar bhalla on sunday.

However, he later clarified that they were in Prayagraj for Maha Kumbh.“May this sacred gathering strengthen our collective spirit and guide us toward a brighter future,” Biren posted Thursday. “...I pray for peace, prosperity, and the well being of our great nation and the beloved people of Manipur.”The sudden move comes ahead of the upcoming assembly session where Congress planned to move the no-confidence motion against the CM.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh claimed that Biren resigned from the top job sensing that Congress was set to move a no-confidence motion against him and his council of ministers.In a social media post on X, Ramesh said, "" The Congress was all set to move a no-confidence motion against the chief minister and his council of ministers in the Manipur assembly tomorrow.

"After Delhi loss, does AAP need 'new model' to keep hold in Punjab?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-delhi-loss-does-aap-need-new-model-to-keep-hold-in-punjab/articleshow/118087335.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the political analysts believe, must develop a "" Punjab-specific development model "" to strengthen its position in the state after its ""Delhi model"" failed to gain traction in the national capital in the recently concluded assembly elections.Following the party's embarrassing defeat in Delhi, the opposition in Punjab is expected to become more aggressive in their efforts to challenge AAP ahead of the 2027 state elections.Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is set to form the government in Delhi for the first time after 27 years after securing 48 out of 70 seats in the polls.Political experts suggest that AAP's loss in Delhi poses a significant challenge for the party in Punjab, where it must work to maintain its unity and enhance its governance.AAP came to power in Punjab in 2022 with a sweeping victory, winning 92 out of 117 assembly seats. It campaigned on the promise of replicating the ""Delhi model,"" which included benefits such as free electricity, financial assistance for women, improved healthcare, and better education facilities.Ronki Ram, a political science professor at Panjab University, told news agency PTI that Delhi voters rejected this model as they deemed it unsustainable.""If people of Delhi did not support that model then why would people of Punjab support it?"" he asked.Pramod Kumar, chairperson of the Institute for Development and Communication, echoed similar sentiments.""They (AAP) promised to implement the Delhi model of development in Punjab. What fate that model has met in Delhi, the same fate it will meet in Punjab. They will have to plan a Punjab-specific model. The lesson is that the Delhi model will not function in Punjab,"" he stated.According to the experts, AAP’s setback in Delhi not only poses a challenge for the party but also provides an opportunity for opposition groups in Punjab as the next assembly elections approach.""Now, Punjab will come into an election mode and the AAP will be shifting its total focus in Punjab. For AAP, this is the challenge of how to keep the party consolidated which means to keep its MLAs together so that they could not be poached by any party,"" Kumar said.""The second challenge is how to give a better performance. There will be a direct intervention of party leader Arvind Kejriwal in day-to-day affairs to improve the party's performance in the state,"" he explained.As for the opposition, Kumar noted that the future of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and BJP depends on whether they decide to form an alliance. Otherwise, both parties would struggle to pose a strong challenge to AAP individually.The Congress, on the other hand, will have to strategise on how to regain prominence and take an assertive stance in Punjab.Before the Delhi assembly elections, AAP’s Punjab leadership, including chief minister Bhagwant Mann, cabinet ministers, MPs, and MLAs, actively campaigned for the party’s candidates in Delhi.They highlighted achievements in Punjab such as providing 50,000 government jobs, offering 300 units of free electricity, launching 850 'mohalla clinics,' and acquiring a private thermal power plant.Mann, a key campaigner, led roadshows in Delhi, promoting his government's work in Punjab to garner support for AAP candidates.Meanwhile, opposition parties in Punjab have been highly critical of the AAP government, citing concerns over deteriorating law and order, increasing debt, and drug-related issues.Following AAP’s defeat in Delhi, political opponents in Punjab accused the party of misleading voters.They asserted that the people of Delhi had ""exposed the lies and deceit"" of the Arvind Kejriwal-led party and condemned the Mann government for ""misgovernance"" and ""deceiving voters with false promises.""Delhi assembly results mark AAP’s second major electoral setback after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, where it managed to win only three out of Punjab’s 13 parliamentary seats.With AAP facing a critical juncture, its future in Punjab remains uncertain as political opponents ramp up their attacks, sensing an opportunity to weaken the party’s hold on the state.Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa predicted internal strife within AAP’s Punjab unit, claiming, ""There would be an internal power struggle between Bhagwant Mann and Arvind Kejriwal.""Union minister Ravneet Singh Bittu echoed similar sentiments on X, posting, ""History rewritten in Delhi! After 27 years, the people have given BJP a resounding mandate, embracing PM @narendramodi's vision of Viksit Bharat. This victory is a testament to trust, development, and a brighter future. Thank you, Delhi.""He further accused AAP of harbouring ""the most corrupt leaders"" and suggested that the party’s downfall in Punjab was imminent.","Aam aadmi party (aap) must develop a punjab-specific development model, analysts say. The party's ""delhi model"" failed to gain traction in the national capital in the recently concluded assembly elections. The opposition in punjab is expected to become more aggressive in their efforts to challenge aap ahead of the 2027 state elections.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118094902,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1469686,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

He motivated them, acknowledging that they contested the elections strongly despite the entire machinery being against us and the MCC being openly violated,"" Sisodia said.AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan, who won in Okhla echoed similar sentiments, expressing disappointment over the election outcome. ""We are deeply saddened by the result. It feels like the system, Election Commission, police, and all powers were used by them (BJP) to intentionally cause the loss (to AAP). The margin was too small,"" Khan said.The allegations come after AAP suffered a significant defeat in the Delhi Assembly elections, securing only 22 out of 70 seats, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 48, marking a decisive return to power in the national capital after 27 years. Among the AAP stalwarts who lost their seats were former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Sisodia, and ministers Satyendra Jain and Saurabh Bharadwaj.Before the elections, AAP had already raised concerns about MCC violations, accusing the BJP of using government machinery to manipulate the electoral process. The party had claimed that BJP workers were distributing cash and gifts to voters and using state institutions to harass AAP candidates. These claims were dismissed by the Election Commission at the time, which maintained that the elections were conducted fairly.Interestingly, Sisodia and Khan's comments come a day after Kejriwal had conceded defeat and congratulated the BJP. ""We accept people's mandate with humility and I congratulate the BJP for its victory. I hope they will fulfil the expectations of the people of Delhi,"" he said in a video message. He acknowledged the work AAP had done in education, infrastructure, and utilities over the past decade and pledged to serve as a constructive opposition. ""We are not in politics for power; we consider it a medium to serve people,"" he added.BJP’s Parvesh Verma defeated Kejriwal in the New Delhi constituency by a margin of 4,089 votes. Manish Sisodia lost his Jangpura seat to BJP’s Tarvinder Singh Marwah by 675 votes. Congress, once a dominant force in Delhi, failed to win any seats for the third consecutive election.","Aam aadmi party (aap) suffered a significant defeat in the delhi assembly elections, securing only 22 out of 70 seats.

A Reflection of Voter Sentiment A Major Political Shift

NEW DELHI: As AAP reels from its crushing defeat in the Delhi elections, social activist Anna Hazare has delivered a scathing rebuke of Arvind Kejriwal, blaming his downfall on greed for power and money. Hazare, who once mentored Kejriwal during the anti-corruption movement, said their ties ended when the AAP leader ""took the wrong path."" Criticising the liquor policy, Anna said that the AAP leader's focus on power and liquor policies ultimately led to the party's demise after more than a decade in power.""Initially, I was not unhappy with him, but when he took the wrong path, came into power, and his thinking changed—focusing on liquor shops and all—our ties ended,"" Hazare said. ""Alcohol causes immense suffering to women. I am 90 but still healthy; if I had consumed alcohol, I would not be healthy,"" he added.The activist recalled Kejriwal’s earlier promises of simplicity and service to the people, which he believes were abandoned once AAP came to power. ""He used to say that he will stay in a small room all his life... Happiness is not found outside... Doing good work for society makes one happy from within. He did not understand this... Otherwise, he would have never thought of making the 'Sheesh Mahal',"" Hazare said.Speaking from his village Ralegan Siddhi, Hazare criticised Kejriwal's choices, saying that Kejriwal's governance strayed from the principles they had once fought for. ""When he formed the party, people trusted and supported him. Later, however, he started promoting liquor and went after money, which has drowned him and his party today,"" Hazare remarked.Hazare’s remarks come in the wake of AAP’s crushing defeat in the Delhi assembly elections, where the BJP secured over two-thirds of the seats, ending more than a decade of AAP’s rule in the capital. Kejriwal himself lost his long-held New Delhi seat to BJP’s Parvesh Verma by 4,089 votes. Other AAP bigwigs, including former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and senior party figures like Satyendra Jain and Saurabh Bharadwaj, also faced defeats.The BJP’s return to power in Delhi after 27 years was met with strong remarks from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who called it a “historic” victory. ""The people of Delhi have driven out 'AAP-da'. Delhi has been freed from the 'AAP-da',"" Modi said in his victory speech, using a play on words to compare AAP to a disaster. He credited the victory to the BJP’s commitment to development and governance.","Social activist anna hazare has delivered a scathing rebuke of arvind kejriwal.

Poll What Do You Think Played the Biggest Role in Election Outcomes? Challenges in Governance and Public Services Effective Campaigning Strategies

BJP-AAP vote share gap is quite small. So, what swung the election decisively in BJP’s favour? Some short takes:

Saffron's long march

Taking the middle out



‘Fakes’ among freebies

Brand Kejriwal loses sheen



Modi hai toh…

NEW DELHI: The national capital on Saturday witnessed a saffron tsunami with the BJP securing a resounding victory in all parliamentary constituency areas, winning 48 out of 70 assembly seats.Aam Aadmi Party, however, maintained a stronghold in Muslim- and Dalit-dominated constituencies.What seemed to have worked in favour of the BJP was the, middle class andfactor (excise policy case), along with the ""sheeshmahal"" attack on AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal during the poll campaign.What seemed to not have worked in AAP's favour were issues like poor roads, traffic congestion, Yamuna pollution, and poor air quality.BJP’s campaign for Delhi started much before polls were announced. Every bad headline against AAP was followed by a sustained BJP campaign, hurting the incumbent. Closer to elections, ‘sheesh mahal’, as BJP cleverly named the generously refurbished CM residence, hurt AAP’s image even more.Also Read: 'Hold BJP accountable for poll promises': Kejriwal's directive to Delhi AAP MLAs After initially criticising AAP’s freebie game, BJP, too, made populist promises with gusto. BJP also talked up the idea of a double-engine sarkar, even as perceptions of govt dysfunctionality took hold, in part thanks to the LG-AAP fight. By the time polls were held, many voters had bought BJP’s argumentVote-share stats make it clear AAP has lost little of its core low-income vote. BJP would have always strategised with that assumption — and therefore it targeted Delhi’s neo-middle class and middle class, who were more upset with the state of roads, traffic, Yamuna, and air pollution than they were impressed by free water, power and primary health care.To that, BJP added the announcement of the 8th Pay Commission — Delhi voters include many govt employees and their families — and the Budget’s income tax cuts.BJP campaigned hard against some elements of AAP’s welfare policy regime. ‘Fake medicines’ and ‘ghost patients’ in free mohalla clinics was one such campaign. AAP contested these claims hotly.Also Read: Delhi loss may trigger churning in AAP's Punjab den But some of those charges stuck when coupled with demonstrable failures like Yamuna ﬂowing as dirty as ever and desperate AAP claims like Haryana’s BJP govt ‘poisoning’ Yamuna water.That AAP suffered big losses in seats along the Haryana border tells this story powerfully.Kejriwal started as a ‘humble man of the people’ who didn’t want to stay in govt bungalows. But he came into these polls as a very different leader. He and his colleagues didn’t recognise that aside from anti-incumbency against AAP, there was anti-incumbency against Kejriwal himself.When things turned against AAP, Modi’s appeal, dormant in the last two assembly polls, came to the fore. He was front and centre in BJP’s campaign and his sharp attacks and promises of smooth coordination between the Centre and Delhi made an appreciable difference","Bjp secured a resounding victory in all parliamentary constituency areas, winning 48 out of 70 assembly seats.

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party's sacked co-founder Prashant Bhushan on Sunday held former ally Arvind Kejriwal responsible for the party's loss in Delhi assembly elections . Bhushan also accused Kejriwal of turning the party into a ""supremo-dominated"" and ""corrupt"" organisation.In a social media post on X, Bhushan accused Kejriwal of building 'sheesh mahal' for himself and travelling in luxury cars.""Kejriwal is largely responsible for AAP’s Delhi debacle. A party formed for alternative politics which was supposed to be transparent, accountable & democratic was quickly transformed by Arvind into a supremo dominated, non transparent & corrupt party which didn’t pursue a Lokpal & removed its own Lokpal,"" Bhushan said.""He built a 45 crore sheesh mahal for himself & began travelling in luxury cars. He binned 33 detailed Policy reports of expert committees set up by AAP, saying that the party will adopt expedient policies when the time comes. He felt that politics could be done by bluster & propaganda. This is the beginning of the end of AAP,"" he added.Bhushan also shared an open letter addressed to Kejriwal in 2015 after AAP's disciplinary committee leadership expelled him and activist Yogendra Yadav, accusing them of anti-party activitiesIn the letter, Bhushan had warned Kejriwal that the dream of clean, principled politics could well turn into a ""nightmare"".""You feel that you can rectify everything by running the Delhi government well in the 5 years that you have. You think that if you deliver on governance, people will forget what you have done to the party. I wish you well in that endeavour. Even traditional political parties like Congress, BJP have done some governance. But the dream that we started with for clean and principled politics and corruption free governance was much much bigger. The fear that I have, is that after how you have behaved and the character traits that you have showed, this dream of clean and principled politics that the Aam Aadmi party was founded on may well turn into a nightmare. But still, I wish you well,"" Bhushan had written.BJP won a historic mandate in Delhi, returning to power after 27 years.

Notable mention: Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Riding on the wave of recent successes in Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections just a few months ago, the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) registered a big win in the Delhi assembly elections. Arvind Kejriwal 's Aam Aadmi Party suffered an embarrassing loss as most of its heavyweights lost the contest.The BJP secured a significant victory in Delhi, winning 48 seats in the 70-member assembly. AAP , which had dominated the previous two terms with a substantial majority, managed only 22 seats. The Congress party failed to secure any seats for the third straight time.The BJP and its NDA allies celebrated the Delhi win, attributing it to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership. The Congress, however, maintained that the results reflected a verdict on AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal rather than Modi's governance.The Congress defended its decision to contest against Aam Aadmi Party, criticising those who questioned their stance. They pointed out that similar concerns about opposition unity were not raised when AAP contested elections in Goa, Gujarat, Haryana and other states, potentially dividing the secular vote.The BJP, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi swept the Delhi assembly elections with a comfortable majority. This victory marks the third major electoral success for the BJP in the last four months after winning the states of Haryana and Maharashtra. With this, the 27 years exile of the BJP in Delhi also comes to an end. This major win also indicates approval by the middle class to Modi government’s big tax relief in the Union budget 2025 last week have got the approval of middle-class consumers.With this, PM Modi yet again proves to be the star campaigner for the BJP.In a high-stakes battle for New Delhi assembly seat, BJP leader Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant slayer by defeating former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal by 4,089 seats.Son of former CM Sahib Singh Verma, Parvesh was was entrusted to take on Kejriwal who has held in to the seat last three times. In 2013, Kejriwal had emerged as giant slayer by defeating then CM and Congress veteran Sheila Dixit.After dethroning the three-time CM, Verma is also in now a strong contender for the top post.BJP leader Tarvinder Singh Marwah emerged as another giant slayer as he defeated former deputy CM and AAP senior leader Manish Sisodia. Marwah defeated three-time MLA Sisodia to win Jangpura seat by 675 votes. Sisodia had switched seats from Patparganj to Jangpura this time hoping for a comfortable win.Marwah, who was in Congress for a long time and elected three-time MLA from Jangpura, had switched to BJP in 2022 after complaining of not getting time with Sonia and Rahul Gandhi for a meeting.Also read: Delhi election results: How the OGs of AAP became Kejriwal’s biggest critics over the decade As the heavyweights of Aam Aadmi Party fell one by one, Atishi stood tall and won the Kalkaji assembly seat. In a high-stakes contest, Atishi won by 3,521 votes defeating BJP's Ramesh Bidhuri and Congress's Alka Lamba.""I thank the people of Kalkaji for showing trust in me. I congratulate my team who worked against 'baahubal',"" Atishi said.""We accept the people's mandate. I have won but it's not a time to celebrate but continue the 'war' against the BJP,"" the 43-year-old said.Her victory is a standout for the AAP as its top leaders Arvind Kejriwal and former Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia lost their constituencies.With the defeat served to Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia, Atishi may now also take charge as the leader of opposition in Delhi assembly.The Congress leader may have lost the contest today but he surely has emerged as the 'Baazigar' of this poll season. Son of veteran Congress leader and three-time CM Sheila Dikshit, Sandeep got his ultimate revenge against Arvind Kejriwal today.Though he did not win the New Delhi seat, he managed to eat in to Kejriwal's votes that eventually led to the AAP chief's defeat.It was a matter of prestige for Sandeep, who was finally given a ticket from New Delhi, his mother's bastion, which had been the stronghold of Kejriwal since 2013.It's no surprise there. The one at the top of this list is AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal. The politician, who rose to power as a anti-graft crusader found himself embroiled in corruption cases.After walking out of jail on bail, Kejriwal resigned from the top post seeking validation from the public of Delhi. The union territory, however, refused to give the stamp of 'Mr Clean' to Kejriwal.The AAP suffered a major blow this election and now will have to look at ways to reinvent itself.The former deputy chief minister of Delhi and second-in-command of AAP, Sisodia, also faced defeat against BJP candidate Tarvinder Singh Marwah in the Jangpura constituency.Having previously served as a three-term MLA from Patparganj in east Delhi, he chose to contest from Jangpura in this election.Following his arrest in 2023 over alleged corruption in the liquor policy case, Sisodia was imprisoned for approximately 18 months until he secured bail. Similar to Kejriwal's stance, he declined to accept a governmental position prior to receiving the ""people's verdict"".Delhi, however, decided to give him another chance this time.After governing Delhi for a decade, AAP faced significant anti-incumbency and lost the election to BJP. This is the first time since its inception that AAP will not hold power in Delhi.With the Delhi loss, AAP is now in power only in Punjab. With this, the national expansion plan of the party has hit a roadblock.The party will now have to regroup and reorganise itself as it now sits in opposition in Delhi.The Congress party has recorded its third consecutive blank in the Delhi assembly elections, marking a stark contrast to its earlier dominance when it governed the capital for 15 consecutive years from 1998 to 2013.Delhi's electorate has consistently rejected the party in three successive assembly elections.After snapping alliance with AAP for Delhi elections , Congress mounted an assertive campaign with former party president Rahul Gandhi spearheading the criticism against Arvind Kejriwal.Despite these efforts, the party failed to secure any constituencies in Delhi. Their sole minor comfort lies in achieving a modest improvement in vote share, rising by approximately 2% from its previous figure of less than 5% in the 2020 assembly elections.Omar Abdullah’s X post captured the mood of INDIA bloc today -- 'Aur lado aapas mein'. The jibe came as AAP and Congress fought against each other which eventually benefitted BJP.With the bitter and ugly fight and AAP’s eventual loss in Delhi, the focus now turns to if it's an end to INDIA bloc.The AAP defeat also comes as an embarassment to Trinamool Congress and Samajwadi Party who actively campaigned for AAP in Delhi.While Congress may have not been able to open its account in Delhi once again, Rahul Gandhi cannot be put in the list of losers. Rahul, who personally took charge to dent Kejriwal's image during the election campaign, was successful in his mission.The defeat also limits AAP within the INDIA bloc who had the capability to challenge Congress' position as a national party. The Delhi blow also gives Congress a little immunity within the bloc where allies SP, TMC, Sena (UBT) chose Kejriwal's party over Congress.","The bjp secured a significant victory in delhi, winning 48 seats in the 70-member assembly.

NEW DELHI: BJP leader Parvesh Verma on Sunday paid floral tributes at his father’s memorial, Dr Sahib Singh Verma Samadhi Sthal, in Mundka, saying his father’s life was an inspiration and that he would work to complete his “unfinished works.” He added that all BJP MLAs would work to beautify Delhi as per Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision.Later in the day, Verma said that February 8 would be written in ""golden letters"" in Delhi’s history, asserting that the entire city was waiting for a “good government” to take charge. ""This is Delhi's victory, not just mine. The whole of Delhi was waiting for a good government to come. The BJP government under the leadership of PM Modi in the country is working for the country. In Delhi, on the same note, we will do all the work with honesty and utmost determination,"" he said at a public gathering in his native village, Mundka.The BJP stormed to power in Delhi's assembly elections, securing a two-thirds majority, while the AAP suffered a major setback, losing key seats. The Congress failed to open its account for the third consecutive time.Verma, who emerged as a giant-killer, defeated former Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal by over 4,000 votes in the New Delhi constituency, while Congress' Sandeep Dikshit secured over 4,500 votes but finished third.Addressing supporters, Verma credited outer Delhi for the BJP’s victory and drew parallels to the 1993 elections. ""Yesterday, the entire Delhi, especially the areas of outer Delhi, made BJP win. This reminds us of 1993. February 8 will be written in golden letters in the history of Delhi,"" he said.Verma said that BJP legislators would dedicate 20-22 hours daily to working for Delhi’s development. ""We have to do a lot of development, but we have lots of challenges too. Nobody looked after the development of Delhi Dehaat... A lot of things will be done in Delhi. Your (people’s) role was only till the elections; from here onwards, we—all the BJP MLAs—will work day and night with the blessings of PM Modi and will take all his schemes to Delhi,"" he said.Verma also received a rousing welcome in Mundka and offered prayers at Dada Bhairav Temple.The BJP secured 48 seats, marking a historic return to power in Delhi after 27 years. Several AAP leaders, including Kejriwal, lost their strongholds, while Atishi managed to retain her seat.The result came months after the BJP-led coalition swept the Maharashtra polls and won Haryana, further consolidating its national dominance. The Congress, once a dominant force in Delhi politics, continued its downward slide, failing to win a single seat in the assembly for the third straight time.Counting of votes took place on Saturday morning, following polling on February 5.","Parvesh verma paid floral tributes at his father’s memorial, dr sahib singh verma samadhi sthal, in mundka.
