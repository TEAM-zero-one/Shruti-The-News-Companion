Owaisi Calls SIR a ‘Backdoor NRC’ in Lok Sabha, Warns of Selective Religious Disenfranchisement

UGC Equity Regulations Explained: What Exists What Changed And Why It Has Sparked Protests

New Delhi: As University Grants Commission’s regulation on promotion of equity in higher educational institutions has stirred a huge debate with a few sections split along the caste divide, a petition has been filed in the apex court for declaring it illegal and unconstitutional for being discriminatory and not covering harassment of non-SC/ST/OBC students.UGC framed the law on the suggestion of the apex court to put in place a mechanism to prevent ragging, sexual harassment, and discrimination on the basis of caste, gender, and disability in educational institutions.The bone of contention is its Section 3(1)(c) which says “caste-based discrimination’’ is against members of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, and other backward classes. The petition sought SC’s intervention to direct UGC and the Centre to ensure everything prescribed under the regulation, be caste-neutral and not only for SC/ST/OBC.",University grants commission’s regulation on promotion of equity in higher educational institutions has stirred a huge debate.

Census 2027 To Kick Off As Government Seeks Data On Homes, Food, Internet And How India Lives Today

New Delhi: The home ministry on Tuesday countered the ""deliberate misinformation campaign"" by the opposition painting the govt as non-serious about caste enumeration, based merely on the Census 2027 ""houselisting"" questionnaire notified last week, despite govt's well-known public stand that caste will be captured in the second stage of the census, that is, population enumeration phase due in Feb next year, that is 2027.Sources said that the sequencing is not something new and recalled that the questionnaire for population enumeration stage of Census 2011 was notified by the then UPA govt only towards the end of the first stage of the census - the ""houselisting and housing"" phase held from April 1 to Sept 30, 2010. As per the notification issued on Aug 31, 2010, a total of 29 questions were listed for the census officer to collect information from persons within his or her area, through the housing schedule.The ""houselisting"" schedule or questionnaire for Census 2011, notified on Feb 25, 2010, had listed 30 questions, unlike 33 questions included in the Census 2027 ""housing"" schedule notified on Jan 22.""Full information on Census 2027 was put out in a press statement dated Dec 12, 2025. Yet, some people are intentionally trying to spread falsehoods about Census 2027, particularly the caste census,"" the home ministry spokesperson said on X a day after Congress's Jairam Ramesh reiterated his allegation questioning the govt's intent to conduct a caste-wise enumeration.""It has been clearly outlined that Census 2027 shall be conducted in two phases, with the caste census due only in the second phase. This two-stage schedule - the first stage being 'houselisting and housing phase' and second, 'population enumeration' - replicates the practice followed in all previous censuses,"" ministry said while attaching its Dec 2025 press statement put out after the Union cabinet approved a proposal to conduct Census 2027 at a cost of Rs 11,718 crore.Sources said the questions to be asked during the population enumeration phase in Feb 2027, including those intended at recording a respondent's caste, may be notified only in Aug or Sept this year.In fact, the questionnaire for the second stage of Census 2021 was yet to be notified when the Covid pandemic forced its postponement days before it was scheduled to start on Apr 1, 2020.","Census 2027 will be conducted in two phases, with the caste census due only in the second phase.

BENGALURU: What a passer-by reported as a road crash turned out to be bone-chilling act of murder on Ananthnagar Road in Electronics City late Sunday evening. The deceased, Prashanth M, 33, and accused, Roshan Hegde, 36, were friends, said police. Roshan works as a software engineer with a firm in Domlur.The murder came to light when M Narayana, DCP (Electronics City), noticed the car dashcam and ordered the footage to be examined. Police said Roshan intentionally crashed the SUV twice to kill Prashanth -- who was clinging to the front-left side of the car -- after driving for 600 metres.Prashanth was a resident of Veerasandra in Electronics City. Roshan is a resident of Vignananagar and a native of Udupi district.Based on a complaint by Prashanth's mother Anu, police have registered a murder case against Roshan.A passerby mistook the scene for a road crash and alerted police, following which, Roshan was rushed to a hospital. The case was initially treated as an accident until M Narayana, DCP (Electronics City), noticed the dashcam on the vehicle and ordered the footage to be examined.Dashcam footage revealed that Roshan had suddenly accelerated and deliberately rammed the vehicle, an SUV, first against a compound wall and then reversed and crashed it again against a tree.In the twin blows, victim Prashanth, who was clinging on the vehicle from outside, suffered serious injuries and died on the spot.""After confirming it was an intentional act, we went to the hospital where Roshan was undergoing treatment. Doctors informed us that his tongue was almost severed and that he underwent a minor surgery. He was discharged on Monday and was taken into custody for interrogation,"" Narayana told TOI.Police said a group of men had gathered to play cricket in Kammasandra on Sunday evening and later consumed alcohol. In a drunken stupor, Prashanth allegedly approached Roshan, seeking a lighter and abused him, triggering an argument. ""In a fit of rage, Roshan assaulted Prashanth and both attacked each other with beer bottles. As the situation escalated, Roshan got into his Tata Safari and tried to leave,"" the police officer said.As Roshan drove away, Prashanth jumped onto the SUV's left footboard and clung on to the front-left window. Dashcam footage showed Roshan initially driving around 35 kmph before accelerating on a deserted stretch, ramming the vehicle into a compound wall, reversing it, and crashing into a tree.Police said the dashcam also captured the two abusing and threatening each other, adding that Sunday's altercation was the fallout of a feud during a cricket match played Saturday.","The deceased, prashanth m, 33, and accused, roshan hegde, 36, were friends.

Captain Samira Zeenat Buttar, from Chandigarh’s Sector 36 led the Integrated Operational Centre tableau themed on Operation Sindoor on Kartavya Path, a role that brought together her recent commissioning, a rare multi-decorated military lineage, and a contemporary operational showcase at the national ceremony.Commissioned into the Indian Army in 2021, Captain Buttar represents a rare continuity of service across four generations. Her great-grandfather served with the 4th Hodson’s Horse in the British Indian Army. Her grandfather, Brigadier Sampuran Singh, then a Lieutenant Colonel, earned the uncommon distinction of being awarded both the Mahavir Chakra and the Vir Chakra for his role in the 1965 Indo-Pak war. He later raised the 19 Punjab Regiment and remained in service until he passed away in 1971 due to battle casualties sustained during the 1965 conflict.The lineage continued with her father, Sarbjeet Singh, an officer of the 8 Mechanised Infantry. Captain Buttar is the only child in the family and the fourth successive generation to wear the uniform.She credits her early grounding in discipline to her schooling. “As a boarding school student, I knew no other way of life than discipline,” Captain Buttar said. “Routine, structure and accountability were part of everyday life, and that shaped how I approached responsibility.”At the Republic Day parade, Captain Buttar led the Integrated Operational Centre tableau, which depicted coordinated planning and operational control. The assignment placed her in command of a display reflecting how contemporary military operations are planned and executed through integrated systems rather than single-arm deployments.Captain Buttar is an alumna of Lawrence School, Sanawar, where she spent her formative years. She said the boarding school environment prepared her for the demands of uniformed service. “You learn to manage yourself early. That stays with you,” she said.She was commissioned into the Army in 2021 after completing her training at Officers Training Academy, Chennai. She pursued a degree in law from the Army Institute of Law, Mohali. She is currently pursuing a PhD from the same institution, focusing on the study of military law in India.Captain Buttar’s presence at the Republic Day parade brought together region’s contemporary contribution to the Army and a family history that has moved with the institution itself- from colonial cavalry regiments and post-Independence infantry formations to today’s integrated operational doctrine.","Captain samira zeenat buttar, from chandigarh’s sector 36 led the integrated operational centre tableau themed on operation sindoor on kartavya path.

Beyond the rulebook

When the University Grants Commission ( UGC ), the statutory body under the Union education ministry that regulates universities and colleges, notified its Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026, it introduced a new set of rules that will apply across campuses nationwide.The regulations govern how colleges and universities must prevent, identify, and respond to discrimination involving students, teachers, and staff.On paper, the objective sounds straightforward. It seeks to ensure that no student, teacher, or staff member is denied dignity or opportunity in higher education because of identity.In practice, however, the new regulations reach deep into the everyday functioning of campuses, shaping everything from admissions and hostels to classrooms, committees, and corridors.The 2026 framework replaces the UGC’s earlier equity rules and shifts the burden of compliance squarely onto institutions and their leadership.Heads of universities and colleges are no longer just administrators; they are now the first line of accountability in preventing and responding to discrimination. New structures, new reporting mechanisms, and strict timelines are written into the rulebook, backed by the threat of serious penalties for non-compliance.Yet, as has often been the case with regulations aimed at correcting long-standing social inequities, the real questions lie beneath the stated intent.How wide is the definition of discrimination? How much discretion do institutional committees enjoy? What happens when complaints are contested, or when the process itself causes harm? And how prepared are campuses to balance speed, sensitivity, and fairness? And is it discriminatory against the non-reserved General Class students?The objective clause sets the tone for the entire framework. It seeks to eradicate discrimination only on specified grounds like religion, race, caste, gender, place of birth, and disability.The word “only” is significant, as it confines the scope of the regulations to discrimination based on specified identity grounds, excluding general grievances or academic disputes.At the same time, the regulations explicitly prioritise certain groups, including:This prioritisation reflects a remedial approach, focusing on historically disadvantaged communities, while formally keeping the protection available to all stakeholders.The definitions section is one of the most consequential parts of the regulations.“Discrimination” is defined broadly to include not only explicit acts but also implicit, indirect, or structural forms of unfair treatment.It extends to actions that have the effect of impairing equality or violating human dignity, even if discriminatory intent is not overt.“Caste-based discrimination” is defined as discrimination against members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes.Importantly, the regulation does not create separate categories of discrimination for different groups but subsumes them within a common framework.“Equity” is defined as providing a level playing field for all stakeholders with respect to rights and opportunities.Together, these definitions significantly expand the interpretive space available to committees tasked with examining complaints. At the same time, the breadth of these definitions leaves substantial discretion with institutional committees.Terms such as implicit or indirect discrimination, structural unfairness, and impairment of dignity are not further qualified in the regulations, offering limited guidance on thresholds of proof or standards of assessment.This ambiguity may allow flexibility in addressing complex forms of disadvantage, but it also opens the door to uneven interpretation across institutions, particularly in contested cases where intent is disputed or where academic or administrative decisions intersect with allegations of discrimination.Every higher education institution (HEI) is required to establish an Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC). The Centre is tasked with a wide range of functions, including policy implementation, counselling, outreach, awareness-building, and grievance handling.Smaller colleges that lack sufficient faculty strength are allowed to rely on the EOC of their affiliating university, ensuring that the requirement applies uniformly across institutions.The EOC is also expected to coordinate with civil society organisations, local administration, police authorities, and legal services bodies. This expansive mandate reflects an attempt to situate campus equity within a broader social and legal ecosystem.Each Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC) must have an Equity Committee, constituted by the head of the institution. Its composition is carefully structured to include:The regulations mandate representation of women, SCs, STs, OBCs, and persons with disabilities within the committee. The committee is required to meet at least twice a year and to review action taken on complaints.The committee’s core role is to inquire into allegations of discrimination and submit a report with findings and recommendations.Beyond formal committees, the regulations introduce two novel mechanisms: Equity Squads and Equity Ambassadors.Equity Squads are smaller, mobile bodies tasked with maintaining vigilance and visiting “vulnerable spots” on campus. Equity Ambassadors are designated individuals in departments, hostels, libraries, and other units who act as nodal points for reporting violations.These mechanisms signal a shift towards continuous monitoring, rather than complaint-driven intervention alone. While intended as preventive measures, they also raise questions about overreach, informal surveillance, and the potential chilling effect on campus interactions.Every HEI must operate a round-the-clock Equity Helpline. Any stakeholder in distress due to discrimination can access it, and confidentiality of the complainant’s identity must be maintained if requested.Where a prima facie case under penal law is disclosed, the information is to be forwarded to the police. This provision effectively links campus grievance mechanisms with the criminal justice system, raising the stakes for both complainants and the accused.The procedure for handling discrimination complaints is tightly time-bound.An aggrieved person can report an incident through an online portal, email, written complaint, or the helpline. Upon receipt, the Equity Committee must meet within 24 hours to decide on the next steps.The committee has 15 working days to submit its report, after which the head of the institution has seven working days to initiate action. In cases involving the head of the institution, the coordinator of the EOC chairs the inquiry.While the timelines aim to ensure prompt action, they also raise concerns about whether complex allegations can be examined thoroughly within such compressed periods.Any person aggrieved by the Equity Committee’s report can appeal to the Ombudsperson within 30 days. The Ombudsperson may appoint an amicus curiae and is expected to dispose of appeals within another 30 days.This appellate mechanism provides an external check on institutional processes. However, it primarily addresses procedural correctness, rather than offering substantive relief for non-tangible harms such as reputational damage or mental distress.The regulations empower the UGC to monitor compliance through inspections, information requests, and national-level committees. Non-compliant institutions face serious consequences, including:These penalties indicate that equity compliance is not optional, but a condition for institutional legitimacy.Despite the breadth of the framework, the regulations are silent on several issues that are likely to shape their reception and operation on campuses. While they lay out detailed mechanisms for receiving and processing complaints, they do not spell out comparable safeguards for non-reserved individuals who may be accused of discrimination, particularly in cases where allegations are contested or later found to be unsubstantiated.There is no explicit provision dealing with malicious or knowingly false complaints, nor is there any guidance on how institutions should distinguish between bona fide grievances and those driven by personal disputes, academic disagreements, or animosity unrelated to identity-based discrimination. The absence of such clarity places a significant burden on institutional committees to exercise judgment, increasing the risk of inconsistent outcomes across campuses.The regulations also do not acknowledge the mental and reputational impact that the complaint process itself can have on the accused. There are no provisions for interim confidentiality for respondents, counselling support during the inquiry, or mechanisms to repair reputational harm if allegations are ultimately not upheld. In tightly knit academic environments, even the initiation of an inquiry can have lasting professional and psychological consequences, irrespective of the final outcome.Another area of concern relates to timelines. While the emphasis on speed is intended to ensure prompt redressal for complainants, the compressed schedule may limit the ability of committees to examine complex factual disputes, especially those involving academic judgment or administrative discretion. In such cases, the pressure to meet deadlines could inadvertently prioritise procedural closure over substantive fairness.The linkage of campus mechanisms with law enforcement, particularly through the equity helpline, further raises the stakes. While intended to ensure swift action in serious cases, this provision may deter open academic engagement or encourage defensive decision-making by administrators wary of escalation beyond the institution.Historically, similar regulatory frameworks in higher education and other sectors have tended to correct outcomes through appellate or judicial review, while leaving the harms caused during the process largely unaddressed. Appeals may overturn findings or set aside penalties, but they rarely compensate for stress, stigma, or disruption suffered in the interim. In the absence of explicit procedural safeguards, this gap is likely to remain.Taken together, these omissions do not negate the objectives of the regulations, but they point to areas where further clarification or supplementary guidelines may be required. How these concerns are handled, whether through institutional practice, regulatory advisories, or future amendments, will play a key role in determining whether the framework strengthens trust on campuses or becomes a source of sustained friction.Vice-chancellors also said the new framework marks a shift from advisory guidelines to enforceable obligations.The question arises because the regulations draw explicit distinctions by prioritising protections for historically disadvantaged groups, while applying a common framework to all stakeholders.Article 14 guarantees equality before the law, but past judicial practice has allowed differential treatment where it is linked to a legitimate objective and applied through non-arbitrary procedures. In that sense, the regulations are framed as remedial rather than exclusionary, focusing on identity-based disadvantage in higher education.However, concerns stem less from the stated objective and more from the structure of implementation. The wide discretion granted to institutional committees, combined with broadly worded definitions of discrimination and the absence of explicit safeguards for those accused, particularly from the unreserved General Class, has led some to question whether outcomes could vary unevenly across campuses. Critics argue that unequal application, rather than unequal text, could create situations where similarly placed individuals are treated differently in practice.The 2026 equity regulations introduce a far-reaching framework for addressing discrimination and inclusion in higher education, expanding the role of institutional mechanisms and regulatory oversight. They formalise a set of duties, procedures, and enforcement tools that universities and colleges will be required to follow.However, the way the framework functions in practice will depend on how institutions interpret and apply its provisions. The manner in which discretion is exercised, timelines are enforced, and contested complaints are handled will shape whether the regulations operate as intended or generate friction within campuses.","Ugc equity regulations explained: what exists what changed and why it has sparked protests. The regulations govern how colleges and universities must prevent, identify, and respond to discrimination involving students, teachers, and staff.

Possibilities for TVK

NEW DELHI: When Prashant Kishor entered Bihar’s electoral arena with Jan Suraaj, he set out to challenge the state’s entrenched caste politics with a different pitch — one centred on governance failures, migration and the promise of jobs. The message found an audience. The votes, however, did not follow.Kishor’s transition from celebrated strategist to politician fell short, highlighting just how hard it is for political outsiders to break through systems built on long-standing loyalties and social networks.Another such case was Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi. After a successful ""India against corruption"" campaign, Kejriwal launched his party and contested its first election in Delhi in 2013. The managed to winning 28 seats in a hung assembly.In 2015, Kejriwal was sworn in as the chief minister after AAP registered an overwhelming mandate and won 67 out of 70 seats.As Tamil Nadu prepares for another assembly election, a familiar outsider story is taking shape once again. Actor Vijay Thalapathy has positioned himself as an alternative for the people in a state where politics, for a very long time, has revolved around the Dravida Munnetra Kashagan ( DMK ) and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK).But will Vijay face the same fate as Prashant Kishor? There is one key difference. This is Tamil Nadu — a state where cinema does not merely entertain, but also governs.Film stars are worshipped like gods in Tamil Nadu. Before the screening of their films, fans offer milk baths on towering cut-outs of these stars. Many stars even have temples across the state.This level of popularity could be one of the reasons that motivates these stars to pivot to politics and attempt to transform their fan base into a voter base. The best examples are M G Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa, who withdrew from active stardom and went on to occupy the top job in the state. While MGR served as chief minister of Tamil Nadu for more than a decade, Jayalalithaa was chief minister for over 14 years across six terms.Similarly, several other actors like Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan, Sivaji Ganesan and Vijayakanth have experimented with politics and turned into full-time politicians.However, many stars were unable to convert their stardom into votes and fell flat during polls.Kamal Haasan launched his party - Makkal Needhi Maiam - in February 2018, positioning it as a centrist, non-Dravidian alternative to the DMK and AIADMK. However, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the party failed to win a single seat. In the 2021 Tamil Nadu assembly elections, Kamal Haasan himself contested from Coimbatore South but lost to the BJP.Additionally, MNM could garner only a little over 2.6 per cent of the statewide vote, as per electoral records.In March 2024, MNM joined the DMK-led Secular Progressive Alliance ahead of the general elections, choosing alliance-building over ideological isolation. Haasan was subsequently offered a Rajya Sabha seat as part of the alliance’s power-sharing arrangement.Rajinikanth, too, had made a euphoric announcement to his fans that he would launch a political party, claiming that his outfit would contest all 234 assembly seats in the state.However, he soon made a U-turn and dropped the plan to take the plunge into politics, citing health concerns.“With extreme sadness, I say that I can’t enter politics. I alone know the pain I went through while announcing this decision,” Rajinikanth said in a three-page statement.“Without entering electoral politics, I will serve the people. This decision of mine will disappoint my fans and people, but please forgive me,” he added.Unlike Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan, Vijay has decided to bid farewell to films after a long career spanning 33 years.His upcoming film Jana Nayagan (if released) would be his last.“Politics is not a time pass for me. It is a deep quest. I wish to immerse myself completely in politics. I have decided to dedicate myself entirely to the service of the people after completing my responsibilities towards one more film I have signed up for,” the 51-year-old Vijay said.Meanwhile, actors like Kamal Haasan and Vijayakanth had to face unfavourable electoral results after deciding to remain active in both films and politics.By stepping away from cinema altogether, Vijay is attempting to address a credibility gap that has historically hurt actor-politicians. Full-time political commitment — rather than episodic engagement between film releases — has often been a prerequisite for voter trust in Tamil Nadu, as demonstrated by stalwarts like MGR and Jayalalithaa in the state.Ahead of the upcoming elections, TVK has been successful in pulling crowds. In October 2024, TVK drew over 8 lakh people during its first state conference in Vikravandi.Thousands of people attend Vijay’s rallies to hear him speak or catch a glimpse of him. The superstar has supporters across every class, gender and age group in different regions of Tamil Nadu.Unlike many film stars, Vijay’s supporters are organised and politically active. In the 2021 local body polls, his “fan club” candidates won 115 of the 169 seats they contested.Meanwhile, his fan clubs have also taken on the role of foot soldiers on social media and regularly conduct blood-donation camps, free medical check-ups, education support drives and disaster-relief work.Additionally, TVK has a significant social media presence. Vijay has claimed that his party has the largest social media force in India.“TVK’s social media army is the biggest in India — not just our claim, but what others are saying after witnessing it. You are no longer just fans on social media; you are TVK’s virtual warriors,” he had said.Yet, Tamil Nadu’s electoral history suggests that crowd mobilisation does not automatically translate into seat conversion. Booth-level organisation, caste arithmetic and alliance mathematics continue to play a decisive role — factors that even popular actors have struggled to master in their first electoral outings.After the Karur stampede, Vijay’s die-hard fans defended him and his party even after the top leadership of TVK went off the radar.However, Vijay and his party may also have to bear the brunt of the stampede in Karur, which claimed 41 lives. Both the AIADMK and DMK have pinned the blame on TVK functionaries and accused Vijay of mismanagement that allegedly led to chaos in September last year.Moreover, the CBI is also grilling Vijay over the stampede, taking up a significant chunk of his time that could otherwise have been used for pre-poll strategy or campaigning.On January 19, the central probing agency questioned the TVK chief for over six hours at its headquarters in New Delhi for the second time in connection with the stampede case.According to officials, several questions related to decision-making about the rally, reasons for his delay, continuation of the speech, his knowledge of the chaos, turnout and crowd mismanagement were put to him.The call on attributing responsibility to individuals in the chargesheet will be taken only after a thorough analysis of the statements of the actor, senior political officials of his party, and police and district administration officials involved in granting clearance and managing the rally, they said.Politically, the impact of the probe remains ambiguous. While rival parties have sought to frame the stampede as evidence of administrative inexperience, sections of Vijay’s support base view the investigation as pressure politics — a narrative that could either erode confidence or consolidate sympathy, depending on how the case unfolds closer to polling.Since Independence — barring a brief stint of Congress rule — the chief minister’s post in Tamil Nadu has largely alternated between the two Dravidian parties — DMK and AIADMK. Vijay’s entry into state politics as a challenger has given voters a third option.At the same time, Vijay’s emergence has introduced new calculations for both the DMK and AIADMK. While the DMK appears wary of losing sections of its youth and urban vote, the AIADMK is closely watching whether TVK dents its traditional base or cuts deeper into the ruling party’s support.Amid reports that the BJP has been pressuring him to join the NDA — citing the CBI inquiry into the Karur stampede and the CBFC sitting on the certification of his film Jana Nayakan — Vijay has said he will not give in to any pressure.He said TVK would contest the assembly elections on its own and win if other parties chose not to align with it. “Unlike the party that ruled and the one that is ruling, we will not allow corruption … I won’t touch a paisa, you know that I don’t need to touch that,” Vijay said, asking his party functionaries and cadres to be as clean.Cleaning up the system cannot be done overnight, he said, adding, “It’s a process.”Even if TVK were to emerge only as the third-largest party, its presence could still alter Tamil Nadu’s political arithmetic. In a fractured mandate, a strong TVK showing could place Vijay in the role of a potential kingmaker — reshaping alliances and bargaining power within the state.In a tripartite contest, it will be interesting to see whether Vijay can emerge as a winner — or whether his entry ends up splitting votes to the advantage or disadvantage of the DMK or AIADMK.Just as the box office determines whether a film is a hit or a flop, election results will reveal whether Vijay succeeds or fails in his political endeavour.","Actor vijay's foray into tamil nadu politics mirrors past celebrity transitions, but his decision to quit films entirely sets him apart. While his fan base is large and organized, the success of tvk hinges on converting this popularity into votes, a challenge that has tripped up other stars.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127623112,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-855573,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Talks with US-based Purdue University for setting up a campus in India have reached an advanced stage, govt sources said, even as interest from British and Canadian universities gathers pace under India's liberalised foreign education regime. Officials said that colleges under the University of London and several Canadian universities have also conveyed keenness, with preliminary discussions underway.The momentum follows policy changes that have opened India's higher education sector to foreign universities. The National Education Policy, 2020 first articulated the case for allowing top global institutions to operate locally, and this was operationalised in 2023 through UGC regulations. The rules allow eligible foreign universities to establish independent campuses, design curricula and set admission norms, marking a decisive shift from earlier partnership-only models.There are foreign universities already running physical campuses in India - Australia's Deakin University and University of Wollongong at Gujarat's GIFT City, and the UK's University of Southampton in Gurgaon. These campuses offer programmes in high-demand areas such as STEM and management, and have demonstrated that overseas institutions can operate within India's regulatory ecosystem.University of Liverpool, University of York and University of Aberdeen, among others are working towards similar operations.Against this backdrop, Purdue University's proposed India campus is being seen as a major credibility boost for the foreign university policy. Sources said discussions have reached an advanced stage, with talks focused on academic offerings, regulatory compliance and operational frameworks. Govt officials indicated that the plan is for Purdue to offer its flagship engineering and technology programmes in India, allowing students to earn a Purdue degree without having to study overseas.","Talks with us-based purdue university for setting up a campus in india have reached an advanced stage, govt sources said.

'Plan to Attack My Residence' Ex‑Congress Leader Claims After Calling Rahul Gandhi ‘Darpok’

Congress hits back with Rajnath's photo

'Insult vs insult'

NEW DELHI: The 77th Republic Day celebration, besides its opulence and exuberance, witnessed a full-throttle political slugfest as political rivals, the BJP and the Congress, engaged in a no-holds-barred spat over something that connects to the poll-bound Assam. A Gamosa!Both parties trained guns at one another after the BJP alleged that Rahul Gandhi refused to wear the traditional Assamese scarf given to all the guests at a reception hosted by President Droupadi Murmu. BJP called it an insult to the northeast, with Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma snubbing what he called the attitude of the ""de facto supremo"".As the BJP levelled serious charges against the Lok Sabha leader of opposition, the Congress didn't hold a punch back, with party member Pawan Khera countring by pointing out that defence minister Rajnath Singh had also not worn the ""patka (scarf)"".Calling the act deeply insensitive, Sarma alleged that the Congress leader’s decision not to wear the traditional patka reflected disregard for the region’s rich cultural heritage.BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla, citing media reports, said in a post on X, “Shameful! Rahul Gandhi has insulted the north east and also disrespected our very hon'ble President.”“From the President and the Prime Minister to foreign dignitaries, everyone wore the Patka with respect and pride.Mr Gandhi alone stood apart, reinforcing a perception of disregard towards the North East,” the Assam chief minister wrote on X.Intensifying his attack, Sarma futher charged that the event explains why the Congress has “lost the trust of the region and much of the country,” adding that “this repeated insensitivity continues”.“Mr Rahul Gandhi must issue an unconditional apology to the people of the North East for this affront. The people of the region deserve respect,” Sarma said.The Congress, however, hit back sharply. Party media and publicity department head Pawan Khera countered the BJP’s charge by posting a picture of Rajnath Singh on X and asking whether the Assam chief minister would also demand an apology from Singh for not wearing the patka.“Hey @himantabiswa, will you seek an apology from @rajnathsingh ji too? Or your entire strategy to fight anti incumbency is to pick up such non issues?” Khera asked, tagging both leaders.Congress MP Manickam Tagore also slammed the BJP, questioning why the defence minister was not targeted over the same issue.“The 2016 batch of betrayer must stop this nonsense. Why is @rajnathsingh ji not wearing the North east patka then? Stop dragging the Hon'ble President @rashtrapatibhvn into your cheap politics,” Tagore said in a post on X.The spat unfolded on a day the Congress also accused the NDA government of insulting the leaders of opposition in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge respectively, by seating them in the third row during the Republic Day parade at Kartavya Path.Sharing pictures of their leaders seated in the back rows, several Congress leaders alleged a “protocol mess-up” and questioned the propriety of the seating arrangement.Responding, Poonawalla accused the Congress of placing “entitlement and ego” as well as “parivar and position” above constitutional norms.“They feel ‘parivar tantra (family system)’ is above ‘sanvidhan tantra (constitutional system)’. Seating is decided by a set format — Warrant or Table of Precedence. One can see even senior cabinet ministers around or even behind Rahul Gandhi but none of them made it an issue,” he said.“Rahul thinks he is the owner of India? By the way, why does he bunk important programmes? Where was he during the VP Oath? CJI Oath? I-Day programme?” Poonawalla added.Another BJP national spokesperson, Pradeep Bhandari, accused the Congress of politicising even the seating arrangements at the Republic Day event, calling Gandhi an “insincere politician”.“Shameful of the Congress to politicise even seating arrangements at Republic Day. Rahul Gandhi is an insincere politician, who chooses politics over national interest,” Bhandari charged.",The bjp and the congress engaged in a no-holds-barred spat over something that connects to the poll-bound assam. The bjp alleged that rahul gandhi refused to wear the traditional assamese scarf given to all the guests at a reception hosted by president droupadi murmu.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah lost his cool during a rally in Bengaluru on Tuesday after some youth Congress leaders started shouting slogans in favour of deputy CM DK Shivakumar before his address.As he rose from his chair and walked towards the podium, a section of party workers began shouting “DK, DK,” with the chants growing louder by the second.Visibly irritated, Sidda snapped at the crowd and asked them to maintain silence, but his appeal went unheeded, prompting him to angrily demand to know who was raising the slogans.""Who are those shouting ‘DK, DK’,"" an irked Siddaramaiah asked the Congress leaders.The situation forced the event’s compere to intervene, publicly warning Youth Congress leaders to stop interrupting the chief minister and listen quietly.""The Youth Congress leaders should keep quiet.

.

NEW DELHI: Highway construction agencies, including NHAI, are in a bind over the recent trend of road contractors quoting low bids of up to 48% less than the estimated project cost, largely due to aggressive bidding, which usually has a direct bearing on the quality of work.In a recent case, the road transport ministry cancelled a tender for a project in Manipur as the contractor with the lowest bid quoted 47% less than the cost the ministry had estimated. The contractor challenged the bid cancellation in Gauhati high court, and the court ordered an interim stay. ""This case is a classic example of how highway agencies are caught in the middle. Highway contractors are getting projects quoting low bids arguing they have quoted price after carrying out detailed assessment,"" said an official.Data since April 2023 showed that because of less number of projects being offered, there is fierce competition among bidders. For each tender, the number of bidders is in the range of seven to 19.Officials and industry insiders said that while there has been a huge increase in the number of highway contractors in the past 7-8 years, with govt rolling out a large number of projects and also bringing down the qualification criteria, there has been a significant fall in the number of works being bid.""This has resulted in players quoting low bids to ensure that their manpower and machinery do not lie idle, which causes further financial stress. This trend will hurt the sector and quality of work as well since we can't reject a lowest cost or L1 bid in construction works,"" said another official.The details of some of the low quoted bids since 2023-24 showed that a project in Madhya Pradesh - four-laning of Rahatgarh to Berkhedi - was bid out at Rs 324 crore, which was 48.4% less than NHAI's bid cost of Rs 627 crore. In the case of another project in Maharashtra - augmentation of existing stretch in urban areas of Pune on the Pune-Satara section - was bid out at Rs 321 crore, around 46% less than the project cost estimated by the highway authority.Similarly, the work for four-laning from Dareota to Kalar Bala in Himachal Pradesh was tendered at Rs 435 crore against NHAI's project cost of Rs 734 crore this year, which was around 41% less.","Highway construction agencies, including nhai, are in a bind over the recent trend of road contractors quoting low bids.

Affidavit rider to complaints to offer relief to public servants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/affidavit-rider-to-complaints-to-offer-relief-to-public-servants/articleshow/127655809.cms,"New Delhi: An allegation made against a public servant before a magistrate will not be sufficient to put in motion proceedings against him as Supreme Court Tuesday ruled that the complaint must be backed by an affidavit. The court said it was needed to ensure that judicial proceedings were not misused ""to settle a score"".While interpreting section 175 of Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Manmohan said that the section was somewhat confusing and needed judicial interpretation.""Suffice it to record at the outset that BNSS being a statute of recent origin, which has been enacted after exactly half a century of its precursor (CrPC), governing the field of criminal procedure, one would have expected the legislative drafting thereof to be of the highest order with clear expression of the will of the people. Sadly, Section 175 BNSS is somewhat confusing and requires ironing out the creases in the legislation without altering the material of which it is woven,"" the bench said.The court said the legislative intention behind insertion of sub-section (4) of Section 175 was clear: Parliament intended it as an additional safeguard for public servants when a complaint was made against them. ""Cognizant of practical realities and to prevent false or frivolous allegations, it appears to us that the mandate is to obtain a report from the accused public servant's superior officer and to extend to such a public servant an opportunity to explain his side of the story.While society's interest is served by prosecuting offenders, it is equally vital, if not more, to ensure that prosecution is not launched against individuals, including public servants, to settle a score or wreak vengeance or put them in such an awkward position that it becomes difficult for them to act in a similar future occasion. The responsibility, nay duty, after all, is not just to pursue the actual culprit, but also to protect the innocent from being falsely implicated, wrongly accused and unnecessarily victimised,"" it said.Section 175(4) says any judicial magistrate empowered under Section 210 may, upon receiving a complaint against a public servant arising in course of the discharge of his official duties, take cognizance, subject to - (a) receiving a report containing facts and circumstances of the incident from the officer superior to him; and (b) after consideration of the assertions made by the public servant as to the situation that led to the incident so alleged.The court said sub-section (4) was not an independent provision but operated subject to the procedural safeguards that sub-section (3) embodied, including the requirement that the application be supported by an affidavit.","Justices dipankar datta and manmohan said that the section was somewhat confusing and needed judicial interpretation.

NEW DELHI: In response to a Right to Information application, National Medical Commission (NMC) has revealed it has taken up 185 appeals by doctors against state medical councils' decisions from its inception in Sept 2020 till Jan 2026, while it has returned 256 appeals filed by patients in the same period.Recently, health ministry had asked the commission to consider hearing appeals filed by patients and/or their relatives against state council rulings on alleged negligence by doctors.Responding to a complaint by an RTI activist and ophthalmologist Dr KV Babu, who has been following up the issue of patients' appeals being rejected, policy division of health ministry asked NMC to ""take necessary action in accordance with the law"". In his complaint, Dr Babu urged the ministry to take action against NMC members who took ""an illegal decision"" in 2021 to return appeals filed by patients claiming that NMC Act did not allow them to appeal.In Oct 2021, NMC's Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB) had decided that in keeping with NMC Act, 2019, ""only medical practitioners or professionals should be allowed as (sic) appeals before EMRB"". Section 30(3) of NMC Act states that medical professionals aggrieved by state council decisions can appeal.Though nothing in the section expressly bars patients from filing appeals, EMRB inserted the word ""only"" medical practitioners into its reading of the section in its Oct 2021 meeting.""Ever since NMC was formed, they have been rejecting, on average, one patient appeal every week, 256 rejections in more than five years. There is no explicit provision in NMC Act which bars the hearing of appeals from the public. If anything, the act clearly mandates that NMC is to adopt earlier statutory provisions of MCI. Rejecting patient appeals has been illegal right from the start. Moreover, in 2024, in the 16th meeting of NMC it was agreed that all appeals received by EMRB will be entertained. However, EMRB has continued to reject appeals coming to it,"" said Dr Babu.The draft amendment of NMC Act put in public domain by health ministry in Dec 2022 contains a provision that explicitly provides for the public to file appeals before NMC's EMRB against decisions of state councils in complaints related to medical negligence or professional misconduct. A file noting acquired using RTI showed that the amendment was approved in 2023. However, the file hasn't moved since then.","Non-med practitioners can’t file appeals, nmc’s ethics board ruled in 2021.

New Delhi: Suggesting amendments to penal laws to provide harsh punishment to acid attack convicts, Supreme Court on Tuesday opined that the present reform-oriented sentencing system must not apply to such convicts and their properties should be auctioned to compensate acid attack survivors.After acid attack survivor-petitioner Shaheen Malik narrated her pains, legal fight for 16 years and acquittal of all accused, a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices R Mahadevan and Joymalya Bagchi said, ""Some extraordinary punitive measures are needed to be taken to deter people from assaulting others with acid or other corrosive substances.""The bench asked additional SG Archana Pathak Dave to get the Centre's response in four weeks.The bench asked additional SG Archana Pathak Dave to get the Centre's response in four weeks on creating a dedicated corpus to compensate acid attack survivors and on bringing amendments to penal laws to shift the onus of proving innocence on the accused by carving out an exception to the general rule ""innocent till proven guilty in a court of law"".The CJI Kant-led bench said it will also examine whether personal properties of an acid attack case convict should be attached and auctioned to compensate the survivor.To prevent an accused from creating third party interest in their assets, the trial court should attach the properties and auction it after the accused is found guilty, it said, adding that ""the system, police and courts must adopt a harsh approach towards acid attack accused"".The court was informed by advocate Sija Nair that the trial gets vitiated because of the snail-paced process and said trial in an acid attack case in West Bengal is pending for the last 23 years.She said 15 high courts have submitted pendency of acid attack trials in their jurisdictions and the highest number of trials at 198 are pending in Uttar Pradesh, followed by West Bengal (160), Gujarat (114) and 60-odd each in Bihar and Maharashtra.","Supreme court opined that the present reform-oriented sentencing system must not apply to such convicts.

Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Tuesday said that the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code in the state has ushered in a new era of women's empowerment.Addressing a programme marking the first anniversary of UCC implementation, celebrated as 'UCC Day', Dhami said that discrimination, inequality, and injustice prevailed in society due to different personal laws for certain communities.He said, ""The implementation of the UCC has not only given equal rights to all citizens of the state but has also ushered in a new era of women's empowerment in the state.""""Not a single case of ' halala ' has been reported since the implementation of UCC,"" the chief minister said.Dhami said, ""Now the Muslim sisters and daughters of Uttarakhand have been freed from social evils like halala, iddat, polygamy, child marriage, and triple talaq. Not a single case of halala has been reported in Uttarakhand since the implementation of the UCC, and that is why Muslim women have welcomed this law.""The chief minister, however, also said that some cases of polygamy have been reported in the state, and the strictest action will be taken against them.Uttarakhand is the first state in the country to implement the UCC.Dhami said that for decades after independence, due to ""vote bank politics"", no one dared to implement the UCC, while a uniform code is already in force in all developed and civilised countries, including major Muslim nations.He said that all the framers of the Constitution, including Baba Saheb Ambedkar, had included the UCC in the Directive Principles of State Policy under Article 44 of the Constitution.Dhami said that before the 2022 Assembly elections, he had promised to bring the UCC, and the public supported him on this.Dhami said that work started as soon as the new government was formed, and after completing all the procedures, it was implemented on January 27, 2025.Describing this day as a ""golden chapter"" in the history of Uttarakhand, he said that it was a matter of immense personal pride for him that he had successfully implemented the law.The chief minister reiterated that the UCC is not against any religion or sect, but rather a legal effort to eliminate social evils and establish ""equality and harmony"" among all citizens.He said, ""Through this law, the fundamental beliefs and practices of any religion have not been changed; only the harmful practices have been removed.""Dhami said that the state government recently brought an ordinance related to necessary amendments in the UCC, under which there is a provision to annul marriages if a person conceals their identity or provides false information at the time of marriage.He said that, along with this, strict punitive provisions have been ensured for any kind of force, coercion, fraud, or illegal acts in marriage and live-in relationships.Dhami also honoured the officers who contributed to the UCC and those who did commendable work in its registration.","Uttarakhand is the first state in the country to implement the ucc.

Some even commented how (former chief minister) Tarun Gogoi's son could be like this,"" he said.Sarma said the cabinet decided to bring in a formal memorandum on the topic to decide the future course of action on the case in its next sitting on February 7.""Whether the report will be forwarded to the Union Home Minister for an investigation by the NIA, RAW or IB, or Assam Police will continue probing the matter -- this will be decided on February 7.On February 8, we will close the chapter,"" he added.Sarma stressed that the SIT report is going to be a ""very sensitive and shocking"" document for the public.""The cabinet also authorised the CM to address a press conference to make the public aware of the findings of the SIT to the extent possible. Some secret and sensitive information may not be shared, but most of the facts will be presented before the public,"" he added.Accordingly, a press conference will be organised at 10:30 am on February 8 to reveal most of the SIT findings, the CM said.""If anyone from the national media wants to come from outside the state to cover the press meet, we will be happy to facilitate them,"" he added.Sarma had last year announced to make public all evidence related to Gogoi's alleged link by September 10, 2025. Earlier this month, he had said that the hullabaloo over popular singer Zubeen Garg's death on September 19 caused a delay.The Assam CM and the BJP have been attacking Lok Sabha MP Gogoi over his wife's alleged connection with Pakistan's spy agency ISI.A Special Investigation Team (SIT) probed a case of alleged interference of Pakistani national Ali Tauqeer Sheikh, who was claimed to have links with Gogoi's British wife Elizabeth Colburn, in India's internal affairs.""Sheikh is a Pakistani national, so there is no doubt about him. The SIT found that Gogoi and his wife have direct links with Pakistan, and they presented the proofs in front of the cabinet,"" the CM claimed.He said that Colburn was examined by the SIT sleuths during the course of the investigation, besides quizzing 22-25 more people.Referring to the citizenship of Gogoi's wife and children, Sarma said, ""In the family, there is one Indian and three foreigners. If he (Gogoi) had any shame, he should have immediately given Indian citizenship to his children after the controversy erupted.""Sarma claimed that the Assam Congress chief considers Indian citizenship as ""second-class"" and gives more importance to British citizenship.Earlier, the BJP leader had claimed that the opposition leader is a ""100 per cent Pakistani agent"".Sarma had alleged that Colburn had travelled 19 times between India and Pakistan and Gogoi had visited the neighbouring country on an invitation from its spy agency ISI and undergone training there.He also claimed that Colburn was collecting various classified government documents, mainly IB reports, on behalf of the Pakistani climate lobby.Hitting back, Gogoi had slammed Sarma over his accusation and questioned his mental state due to issues at the home front. He even said the CM's remarks were ""ridiculous, baseless, insane and nonsense"" and that he was behaving like an ""IT cell troll"" without talking with facts.","Assam chief minister himanta biswa sarma said the cabinet will take a formal decision on the future course of action on the sit report on gaurav gogoi's alleged links with pakistan on february 7.

NEW DELHI: The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) on Tuesday rescued 60 people, including 40 soldiers of a Rashtriya Rifles unit, after they were stranded in a snowbound area of Jammu and Kashmir’s Doda district following heavy snowfall.The high-altitude rescue and road restoration operation was carried out under Project Sampark at Chatergala Pass on the Bhaderwah–Chatergala axis, located at an altitude of about 10,500 feet.The operation began on January 24, a day after continuous snowfall for nearly 40 hours blocked the route.According to the spokesperson, personnel of the 118 Road Construction Company (RCC) under the 35 Border Roads Task Force (BRTF) cleared around 38 km of road buried under five to six feet of snow.The route was reopened by the evening of January 25, allowing the safe evacuation of 20 stranded civilians and 40 personnel of the 4 Rashtriya Rifles, along with their weapons and supplies.The rescue mission was completed by the early hours of January 26 with no casualties. The operation was conducted in close coordination with the Army and helped restore critical communication links in the region despite extreme weather and difficult terrain.Meanwhile, the BRO also restored road connectivity in the Kandi-Kotranka area of Rajouri district after heavy snowfall disrupted movement in the Pir Panjal region.Snow accumulation of up to three feet had cut off the Kandi-Kotranka subdivision from Rajouri town, affecting both civilian and military movement, including medical emergency services.Personnel of the 110 RCC under the 31 BRTF launched round-the-clock snow clearance operations, using specialised equipment and manpower. A single-lane road was initially opened within 14 hours to allow controlled movement of vehicles, including emergency services.The spokesperson said that the clearance and widening work continued. Around 35 km of road was fully restored within 24 hours, ensuring safer and smoother movement in the area.","60 people, including 40 soldiers of a rashtriya rifles unit, were stranded in a snowbound area of jammu and kashmir’s doda district following heavy snowfall.

"Stillbirths rose 44% after Covid, national study finds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stillbirths-rose-44-after-covid-national-study-finds/articleshow/127604577.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Even as hospital deliveries resumed after Covid, India recorded a sharp rise in babies dying just before birth in the post-pandemic period, according to a major national study analysing births between 2019 and 2022. The findings point to serious gaps in pregnancy care—losses that often go unnoticed and are grieved in private.The rise was driven by disrupted antenatal care, delayed referrals and weakened pregnancy and delivery services during and after the Covid-19 pandemic, researchers said. The study documented a 44% increase in the stillbirth rate between the pre-Covid and post-Covid periods.The study, published in BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth, was conducted by researchers from the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) with support from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). It is based on a nationally representative mortality survey covering nearly one million people across nine states—Assam, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh.Data show that India’s stillbirth rate increased from 12.7 per 1,000 births before Covid to 14.4 during the pandemic, and then rose sharply to 18.3 per 1,000 births in the post-Covid period.The increase was most pronounced in rural areas, where rates reached nearly 20 per 1,000 births, compared to about 14 in urban areas, highlighting gaps in access to timely antenatal care and emergency obstetric services.Based on detailed interviews of 745 stillbirths, the study found that 44.7% occurred in public hospitals, 39.2% in private hospitals and 16.1% at home. The dominant place of delivery varied sharply across states: stillbirths were reported mostly from private hospitals in Kerala (66.7%), Gujarat (60%) and Haryana (50%), while public hospitals accounted for the majority in Odisha (72.6%), Assam (69.6%), Maharashtra (54.8%) and Tamil Nadu (54.6%), reflecting differences in health system utilisation rather than state-wise stillbirth rates.More than half of all stillbirths occurred at nine months of pregnancy or later, often just days before delivery, pointing to failures in late-pregnancy monitoring and delivery-time care.Explaining this, Dr Renu Gupta, Director (Obstetrics & Robotic Gynaecology), Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute, Delhi, said: “The rise in late-term stillbirths points to failures in timely risk detection and action, not gaps in early pregnancy care. After Covid, third-trimester monitoring—blood pressure, fetal growth and movement, Doppler studies—has become inconsistent, especially in overstretched public hospitals. Referral delays, staff shortages and weak transport systems mean warning signs are often missed. While delivery numbers have recovered, quality and continuity of care have not, leading to preventable losses just before birth.”Delays were a major factor. Nearly one in five women whose babies were stillborn had been referred between facilities during labour, sometimes being sent back to return later.Only about one-third of mothers were told why their baby died. Despite registration being mandatory, just 1% of stillbirths were officially registered, keeping most cases out of official records.The study also highlighted the emotional toll on families. Nearly half of mothers neither saw nor held their stillborn baby, often due to family decisions or medical advice.Researchers warned that without stronger antenatal surveillance, faster referrals and better quality care during labour and childbirth, India may miss its target of a single-digit stillbirth rate by 2030 under the India Newborn Action Plan.","India recorded a sharp rise in babies dying just before birth in the post-pandemic period.
