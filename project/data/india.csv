DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami recommended Friday a CBI inquiry into the ""mystery VIP"" connected with the 2022 murder of a 19-year-old receptionist at a Rishikesh resort owned by a BJP functionary's son, reports Kautilya Singh.The decision came following days of protests by several civic groups and opposition Congress on the issue, as well as two days after the chief minister met the victim's parents, who had handed him a letter seeking a CBI probe under the supervision of a Supreme Court judge. In the letter, the girl's father said his daughter was murdered because of a ""VIP"" whose identity remains unknown.A day later, the parents had reiterated their demand, adding they ""won't rest"" till they ""find out about the VIP"".Announcing the decision, CM Pushkar Singh Dhami said, ""From the very beginning, our aim has been to ensure justice in a fair, transparent and sensitive manner, and that commitment will continue.

'I cannot hear anything': Judge said, leading to adjournment

KOLKATA: Aftershocks of the showdown between Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee over raids on Trinamool-linked political consultancy I-PAC jolted Calcutta high court Friday, prompting Justice Suvra Ghosh to postpone hearing petitions filed by either side till Jan 14 on grounds of ""enormous disturbance and commotion"" in the courtroom.The judge, seemingly annoyed at her repeated pleas for ""order"" being ignored by lawyers and apprentices seeking to outshout each other, walked out of the courtroom after quickly announcing the forced adjournment.Justice Ghosh specified in her order that she would have heard both petitions as scheduled had a large gathering of lawyers and others not entered the courtroom and caused a ruckus. ""Several requests made by the court to maintain decorum and dignity fell on deaf ears. The environment in the courtroom is not conducive to commence/continue with the hearing,"" she said.Enforcement Directorate, the first mover in the legal battle over Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee's alleged interference in the probe against I-PAC, immediately approached acting Chief Justice Sujoy Paul for an urgent hearing. The plea was turned down. Acting CJ Paul told the agency's counsel Dhiraj Trivedi that there was no justification in pushing for an urgent hearing after the judge assigned to take up its petition had fixed a date.The face-off between ED and Mamata started Thursday afternoon after she drove to the Loudon Street residence of I-PAC director Pratik Jain when the agency was searching the premises for evidence linked to an investigation in a 2020 money laundering case. The CM next went to I-PAC's office in Salt Lake's Sector V, staying put for almost four hours and allegedly taking away sheaves of documents and storage devices that she claimed contained TMC's election strategy.Besides Mamata, ED's petition accuses DGP Rajeev Kumar and Kolkata Police commissioner Manoj Varma of ""theft of digital devices and other evidence, and wrongful restraint and confinement of central govt officers"". Mamata's petition against ED alleges that the central agency was doing BJP's bidding and targeting I-PAC addresses to ""snatch"" Trinamool-specific and other data pertaining to the upcoming assembly elections.Friday's hearing was scheduled for 2.30pm, but the crowd in court no. 5 started to swell after the lunch break ended at 2pm. ED counsel Trivedi and Trinamool's Kalyan Banerjee complained that they were finding it impossible to reach the bench to argue their cases. ""Anyone not associated with the case, please leave,"" Justice Ghosh pleaded.After 15 minutes of chaos, HC officials and a Kolkata Police officer posted outside the courtroom managed to clear a section of the crowd, but the commotion refused to die down. ""I cannot hear anything,"" Justice Ghosh declared, leading to the adjournment.","Enforcement directorate and bengal cm mamata banerjee in legal battle over raids on political consultancy i-pac.

BJP Targets Mamata Banerjee Over ED Raid At I-PAC, Alleges Evidence Tampering

ED raids I-PAC-linked locations; Mamata alleges political vendetta

NEW DELHI: Several Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders, including MPs Mahua Moitra and Derek O’Brien, were detained by Delhi police on Friday while protesting outside Union home minister Amit Shah’s residence and office.The protest was staged against the Enforcement Directorate (ED) raids conducted at the office of the political consultancy firm I-PAC in Kolkata on Thursday.TMC MPs gathered with placards reading “Bengal rejects Modi-Shah’s dirty politics”, highlighting their opposition to the ED action, which they termed politically motivated and aimed at intimidating the party ahead of the West Bengal Assembly elections.Speaking to the media during the protest, Mahua Moitra said, “Yesterday, entire India, Bengal witnessed how ED was misused by the Home Ministry. The ED was sent to steal our party's political, strategic information. Mamata Banerjee is a lioness, she protected our party's properties.”TMC MP Kirti Azad added, “They are acting undemocratically; even the raid was illegal. They loot and accuse us of scams. They took away our strategy and candidate lists. BJP’s internal survey shows they won’t get more than 25 seats. But Mamata Banerjee will secure a massive mandate as CM and go on to become the Prime Minister.”The protest comes ahead of a planned march in Delhi led by West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Banerjee will lead the march from Jadavpur 8B Bus Stand to Hazra More at 2 pm to protest the ED raids, news agency PTI reported.The raids at I-PAC offices targeted two locations in Kolkata on Thursday. Apart from providing political consultancy to TMC, I-PAC manages the party’s IT and media operations, making the action sensitive for the party’s electoral preparations.Banerjee visited the I-PAC premises during the ongoing search, accusing the central agency of attempting to seize internal documents, hard disks, and digital data linked to the party’s election strategy.The TMC has described the ED action as politically motivated harassment, intensifying the standoff between the ruling party in West Bengal and the Union government ahead of the assembly elections.On Thursday, ED conducted searches at multiple locations, including the residence of I-PAC chief Pratik Jain.Reacting sharply to the raids, CM Banerjee accused the Centre of pursuing a political vendetta and misusing central agencies ahead of elections. She alleged that party documents, hard disks and sensitive data were being seized under the guise of an investigation.Questioning the role of the ED and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Banerjee said, “Is it the duty of the ED, Amit Shah to collect the party's hard disk, candidate list?... The nasty, naughty Home Minister who cannot protect the country and is taking away all my party documents. What will be the result if I raid the BJP party office?”She also linked the agency action to the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise in West Bengal, alleging that voter names were being deleted ahead of the polls.“On one side, they are deleting the names of all the voters by carrying out the SIR in West Bengal...Because of the elections, they are collecting all the information about my party,” she said. Banerjee further dared the BJP to fight the TMC politically if it wanted to win Bengal.Banerjee visited I-PAC’s Salt Lake office during the searches, asserting that the Trinamool Congress is a registered political party that pays income tax and cannot be “bulldozed using money and muscle power”.The BJP hit back at the chief minister, accusing her of interfering in a central agency probe. Leader of the Opposition in the West Bengal Assembly Suvendu Adhikari termed Banerjee’s visit to Pratik Jain’s residence during the ED raid as “unconstitutional” and alleged it amounted to direct interference in the investigation.Adhikari further said the ED should take action against the chief minister, claiming her presence along with that of the Kolkata police commissioner, was improper while the search was underway.Officials said the ED raids were conducted at 15 locations in connection with a fake government job scam, allegedly run by an organised gang that duped people by promising employment.",Several trinamool congress (tmc) leaders detained by delhi police on friday.

After 5th August 2019...’ Army Chief Counters Mehbooba’s Charge Against Centre Over J&K Situation

SRINAGAR: Former J&K chief minister and PDP Mehbooba Mufti on Friday described the National Medical Commission’s order withdrawing permission to Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence (SMVDIME) in Reasi to run an MBBS course as one with far-reaching consequences, warning that it could embolden “communal forces” across the country to exclude Kashmiri Muslim students from educational institutions.Mehbooba also questioned the role of J&K’s elected govt, stating that just hours before the NMC announced its decision, CM Omar Abdullah had publicly said the medical college should be shut. “Was there some understanding or discussion going on that whatever he said happened? The chief minister should have stood up against the decision to close the college,” she said, addressing a presser at PDP headquarters.She alleged that the decision was taken solely under pressure to remove Kashmiri Muslims from the medical institution. “The larger question is that Kashmiri Muslim students didn’t get space in their own state. If this is their fate in J&K, how will they be treated in other parts of the country?” she said.The NMC on Tuesday withdrew its Letter of Permission to start the MBBS course at SMVDIME with 50 seats for the 2025-26 academic year, citing major deficiencies in faculty strength, clinical material and infrastructure. It said students admitted during counselling would be accommodated in other govt medical colleges.Many political parties have questioned this, asking if the minimum standards were not met, how was the permission granted just four months ago, on Sept 8, 2025?Omar had on Thursday reacted strongly, saying people across the country fought to get medical colleges while those in Jammu were celebrating the shutting down of one after protests on religious lines. He said Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, which was running SMVDIME, should be asked why the NMC withdrew permission. “Who is the chancellor of the university? You should ask him too,” he told reporters.The chancellor of the university is LG Manoj Sinha.The controversy erupted in Nov last year after 42 of the 50 seats went to Muslim students, mostly from Kashmir, while only seven Hindu students from Jammu made the list.This led to protests by the Jammu-based Shri MataVaishno Devi Sangharsh Samiti, an umbrella group of about 60 religious and civil society groups, which argued that an institution funded by Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board should give preference to Hindu students.BJP later backed the agitation, with party leaders making representations to LG Sinha, who heads the shrine board. They sought a review of the admission policy, arguing that “faith” should be the admission criteria in a college run on the donation of Hindus.",National medical commission withdraws permission to run mbbs course at shri mata vaishno devi institute of medical excellence (smvdime) in reasi.

70 posts of faculty members lie vacant at Safdarjung hospital,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/70-posts-of-faculty-members-lie-vacant-at-safdarjung-hospitals/articleshow/126443210.cms,".

NEW DELHI: One of the country's largest central govt hospitals is functioning with a significant shortage of teaching faculty, potentially straining patient care and medical education.An RTI reply from Vardhman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital administration on Dec 27, 2025, shows that 70 out of the 398 sanctioned teaching posts are vacant.While department-wise data show while 365 faculty members are currently in position - 346 are occupied by regular faculty members and 19 by contractual faculty - 37 are posted in excess in some departments, leaving the 70 posts vacant elsewhere due to uneven faculty distribution.This has resulted in persistent staffing gaps in several critical departments as well as internal imbalances, rather than uniform faculty deployment.Among the core clinical disciplines facing acute shortages, clinical haematology has nine vacancies out of 11 sanctioned posts, while neurology is short of eight faculty members. Cardiology, a high-burden tertiary-care service, has seven vacancies out of 12 posts, and neurosurgery is functioning with five vacant posts.Anaesthesia, central to surgical services, has six vacancies.There are also gaps in departments linked to cancer care and advanced diagnostics. Medical oncology has two sanctioned posts but none currently in position, while nuclear medicine and urology have three and four vacancies, respectively. There are similar shortages in pathology, physiology, pulmonary medicine, endocrinology and forensic medicine, according to the RTI reply.Responding to the RTI findings, Sakshi Chhugh, public relations officer, VMMC & Safdarjung Hospital, said the hospital has a sanctioned strength of 398 teaching posts, of which 345 are presently occupied by regular faculty and 18 by contractual faculty. She said interviews for the remaining 35 posts had already been conducted, and appointments would be finalised in due course as per prescribed recruitment procedures.""The hospital continues to ensure that academic activities, teaching programmes and patient care services remain uninterrupted,"" Chhugh said.Health experts warn that sustained faculty shortages in teaching hospitals can translate into longer waiting times, heavier clinician workload and reduced teaching and supervision for medical students, with direct implications for service delivery at high-volume centres like Safdarjung.","Vardhman mahavir medical college and safdarjung hospital has 70 out of 398 sanctioned teaching posts vacant.

Supreme Court Directs Dogs Be Shifted From Schools, Bus Stands To Shelters; Petitioner Breaks Down

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday continued hearing pleas seeking changes to its earlier order on stray dogs, with actor Sharmila Tagore appearing as one of the applicants through her counsel.The top court sharply pushed back against the submissions made on Tagore’s behalf, saying such arguments were “completely removed from reality.""Appearing for Tagore, counsel told the court that there cannot be a “one size fits all” solution when it comes to stray dogs on the streets. It said the issue must be looked at through science and psychology, adding that while the Animal Birth Control (ABC) rules may not be perfect, they need to be reviewed, not discarded.The counsel said the law already recognises a difference between normal street dogs and aggressive dogs and argued that some aggressive dogs can improve after treatment and behavioural care, though it accepted that aggression can return in some cases. Such dogs, he said, must be clearly identified by designated committees.When the Counsel cited example of a long-standing stray dog at AIIMS, the court said any dog living on the streets is likely to carry ticks and warned that allowing such animals inside hospitals could have “disastrous consequences”. The judges told the counsel not to romanticise the presence of dogs in sensitive public spaces.""Was she being taken to the hospital theatre also? Any dog that’s in the streets is bound to have ticks.And a dog with ticks in a hospital will have disastrous consequences. Do you understand? We’ll let you know the reality of what is being argued. You (the dog lover’s side) are completely removed from reality. Don’t try to glorify these dogs in the hospitals,"" the bench said.Suggestions like colour-coded collars to identify dogs with a history of biting were also raised by Tagore's counsel, citing examples from other countries. The court questioned the comparison and asked lawyers to remain realistic, pointing to differences in population size.The Supreme Court was hearing petitions seeking modification of its earlier directions in the stray dog matter.","The supreme court was hearing petitions seeking modification of its earlier directions in the stray dog matter.

Stray dogs: NGO asks SC to involve experts

NEW DELHI: As animal rights activists submitted that stray dogs need not be removed from premises of public institutions like hospitals and colleges as they are not a threat to humans and that both can live peacefully, Supreme Court on Friday said the picture projected by them in favour of the canines is different from ground realities.Seeking rollback of SC's order to make these premises free of strays, a lawyer told a bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria that recently a picture showing a dog walking along with monks across the US went viral while, in another recent case, a dog came to the rescue of a toddler.The bench, however, said cases of dog bites give a different picture. ""We will tell you the reality at the end of the arguments,"" the bench said.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for NGO 'All Creatures Great and Small', urged the court to involve domain experts, as was done in the Aravali case.The obligation of the court to enforce rights is in the absence of legislation. The court will be building a new edifice if you enter into that territory,"" Singhvi told the bench.""While our amicus is great, the concept of amici are basically law advisers.They are not domain experts. The court must have domain experts along with the amicus. In the recent Aravali judgment, the reconsideration was because that committee had 90% bureaucrats - generalists, not domain experts. Reconsideration was done because the domain experts had to come in. It will improve the quality of court orders,"" Singhvi said.SC has said it would give a hearing to whoever files an application in the matter. Over the past three days, the hearing has spanned for six-and-half-hours and the court has heard the views of 20 individuals and NGOs. It will resume on Tuesday.","Animal rights activists say stray dogs need not be removed from public institutions like hospitals and colleges as they are not a threat to humans.

The row involves land in what used to be ‘Hathroi village’ in official records

JAIPUR: Supreme Court has reopened proceedings in a Rs 400-crore land dispute between Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) and the family of former royal and deputy CM Diya Kumari, setting aside a Rajasthan high court order that allowed a 2011 trial court decree in favour of the princely estate to ""stand without examination on merit"".The bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Vishwanathan held that there was no justification in the high court declining to consider JDA's appeal on technical grounds. The judges directed the HC bench to decide JDA's first appeal on merit within four weeks and submit a compliance report.The dispute involves land in what used to be ""Hathroi village"" in official records before becoming part of central Jaipur's urban sprawl, including prime real estate, schools, hospitals and other civic infrastructure.JDA pegs the value of the land parcel, mentioned in revenue records as ""Siwai chak"" (uncultivable govt land), at Rs 400 crore. The petition says the civic administration took possession of the land in the 1990s, challenging the erstwhile royal family's claim that it was registered as private property under the 1949 Covenant linked to Jaipur's accession to the Indian Union.JDA insists the land was never listed as the former royal family's private property in the covenant schedule, and that swathes of land were lawfully acquired between 1993 and 1995 after paying compensation.In 2005, the royal family filed a civil suit, seeking declaration of ownership. On Nov 24, 2011, the trial court decreed the suit in their favour, declaring them owners. The court set aside revenue entries in favour of the state and restrained JDA from interfering with possession.JDA filed its first appeal in 2012. It was dismissed in Nov 2023, before being restored just over a year later.On Sept 15 last year, HC declined to intervene in the dispute, leaving the trial court decree intact without appellate scrutiny. JDA approached Supreme Court on Dec 10, arguing that public land was lost on technical grounds despite issues involving public title, completed acquisitions, settled revenue records and a constitutional bar under Article 363.","Dispute involves land in what used to be ‘hathroi village’ in official records.

AGARTALA: Tripura HC struck down a 25-year-old state govt policy mandating fixed pay for the first five years to newly appointed employees recruited through competitive examinations, calling it ""unconstitutional"", reports Biswendu Bhattacharjee.The policy - introduced by the Left Front govt in 2001 and 2007 for Group C and Group D posts, respectively - required recruits to sanctioned posts to serve at least five years on fixed pay before being placed on a regular pay scale.The practice continued after the BJP-led govt assumed office in 2018, prompting teachers appointed through Teachers Eligibility Test to move HC, which held that all govt employees were entitled to draw full regular salary from first day of employment.Petitioners' counsel Purushottam Roy Barman said the division bench of Chief Justice M S Ramachandra Rao and Justice Biswajit Palit heard long-pending writ petitions challenging the policy.The 18 employees who filed the writ petitions were directed to pay Rs 2,000 each as court costs.

It was then decided that the staff would be asked to report back to the office from Friday to ""restore normal work"" as quickly as possible.""There was an apprehension that ED would seal our office premises.

BJP Targets Mamata Banerjee Over ED Raid At I-PAC, Alleges Evidence Tampering

KOLKATA: TMC alleged on Friday ED was targeting I-PAC's current chief Pratik Jain, not its founder Prashant Kishor , in its coal scam-linked probe and that the move was linked to the latter's role in ""helping BJP"" in Nov 2025 Bihar elections ""This ED complaint dates back to 2020. Who was at the helm of I-PAC then? It was Prashant Kishor. Then why is Pratik Jain being targeted by ED and not Kishor? The answer is simple. Jain is now helping TMC with its party strategy. And Kishor, with his Jan Suraaj party in Bihar, divided opposition votes, which helped BJP,"" Trinamool spokesperson Arup Chakraborty said.Chakraborty claimed ED's raids on I-PAC betrayed its real motives. ""ED's complaint refers to events that took place in Goa, when Kishor was leading I-PAC. The cat is now out of the bag. ED's real target was TMC's candidate list, strategy documents and SIR-related data,"" Chakraborty said.While TMC's unease with Kishor was evident in 2021 after the party came to office for a third time, the party has never publicly spoken against him. Kishor parted ways with I-PAC to float Jan Suraaj in 2024.Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee referred to Kishor on Friday fleetingly during her protest march against ED's raids.
