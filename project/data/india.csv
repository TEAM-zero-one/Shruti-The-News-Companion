Booze-related health problems spiked in AP from 2019 to 2024: Data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/booze-related-health-problems-spiked-in-ap-from-2019-to-2024-data/articleshow/121066692.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Liver and kidney problems induced by alcohol consumption went up manifold in Andhra Pradesh between 2019 and 2024, a study by the state's health department has found, with the period under question coinciding with the YSRCP regime that is also facing charges of a massive ""liquor scam"".Studying the admissions under the Arogyasri scheme for free treatment to patients between 2014 and 2024, a three-doctor team set up by the health department found that alcohol-associated liver patients went up from 14,026 in 2014-19 to 29,369 in 2019-24.The worst affected were people in the 35-44 years age group - the number of patients in this category shot up from 4,419 to 9,362 during the two five-year periods, a startling 100% increase.Similarly, alcohol-related neurological patients shot up from 1,276 to 12,663 between 2014-19 and 2019-24, with the younger segment (35-44 years age group) being the worst hit - the number of patients in this segment rose from 260 to 2,882, a 1000% increase.Following the same pattern, alcohol-related kidney patients rose from 49,060 to 90,385, an 84% increase.While the jump in the number of patients associated with alcohol consumption would have been just a health problem, the backdrop of the alleged ""liquor scam"" during the Jaganmohan Reddy govt has added a political dimension to the medical woes of locals. The spike overlapped the change of govt in AP, and now, the comparative study of health department under the TDP govt indicts the previous YSRCP dispensation.Speaking with TOI, Krishna Babu, special chief secretary (health and family welfare) said making sense of the results of the study was tricky as medical problems because of alcohol use have shot up massively without the matching spike in alcohol consumption year-on-year.He said, ""We have to check the reason why it has happened. The reasons can be excess consumption, nature of alcohol used and the process of distillation.""The finger, thus, may point to the quality of liquor available in the state during the same period - a point that may be politically fraught given the backdrop of the ""liquor scam"", whereby the allegation is that national brands disappeared from liquor stores in AP and were replaced by unknown and lesser-known labels. YSRCP has denied the allegations of a scam, calling it a narrative peddled by the governing TDP to castigate the opposition party and besmirch its tenure.","Alcohol-associated liver patients went up from 14,026 in 2014-19 to 29,369 in 2019-24.

As she lists one mansion, Taylor Swift transforms another possibly for life with Travis Kelce

After taking some well-earned time off, Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift are slowly easing back into their busy schedules. Following the Kansas City Chiefs ’ Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in February and the conclusion of Taylor’s monumental “The Eras Tour,” the couple took a step back from the spotlight to relax and reconnect in private.As Taylor Swift renovates her Rhode Island mansion into a potential family home, Kelce is back to training for what could be his final NFL season while also upgrading his lifestyle to match their evolving relationship.Taylor Swift is already focused on her next musical chapter, with a new album in development and plans reportedly underway for a 2026 tour, according to sources. Meanwhile, she’s also making moves in real estate, listing her former Cape Cod mansion owned briefly between 2012 and 2013 for sale.The most notable step is Taylor Swift’s decision to renovate her $17.75 million mansion in Watch Hill, Rhode Island. This historic 12,000-square-foot estate, perched on a scenic coastal cliff, is undergoing a $1.7 million transformation to become a primary residence. The upgrades include expanding the bedroom suite and lounge by 400 square feet, redesigning the kitchen, and adding a new bedroom.The living room is also being remodeled, and the front portico will be reconstructed. Permits were quietly filed in late 2024, with construction expected to finish by the end of 2025. Sources suggest Taylor Swift envisions this property as a future family retreat with Kelce.Now, as the off-season winds down, Travis Kelce is back at the Chiefs’ training facility, gearing up for what many believe could be his final NFL season. With a decorated career behind him, this upcoming chapter is set to be both meaningful and emotional.Alongside his return to football, Travis Kelce is also continuing his popular podcast, New Heights, which he co-hosts with his older brother and former Philadelphia Eagle, Jason Kelce. The podcast has become a fan favorite, offering a candid and often humorous glimpse into their lives both on and off the field.Parallel to Swift’s efforts, Kelce is also making big changes to accommodate their shared future. In response to safety concerns following a high-profile burglary at his Kansas City mansion where over $100,000 in valuables were stolen Kelce has significantly enhanced the security of his home. He installed a $40,000 alarm system, multiple CCTV cameras, motion detectors, and floodlights.Additionally, Kelce built a fortified safe room and an underground man cave. Two guard dogs, costing $9,000, and 24/7 private security at $6,000 per month have also been added. These improvements are largely aimed at ensuring Swift feels safe during visits, especially given the intense public and media attention surrounding their relationship.Beyond these two main properties, Swift is reportedly eyeing new real estate in Nashville and Kansas City. Nashville, her long-time base, offers proximity to family and friends, while Kansas City would place her closer to Kelce during the NFL season. Sources indicate that the couple may even be considering purchasing a home together in Kansas City, a move that strongly suggests they are planning for a more settled, domestic life.Also Read: “External forces trying to unbalance them”: Living Nostradamus claims cosmic fate ties Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, warns of looming challenges ahead All these developments point to a serious turn in their relationship.

These property moves go beyond luxury they’re deliberate steps toward building a stable future together.","Taylor swift is renovating her $17.75 million mansion in watch hill, rhode island.

Jerry Jones had his eyes on a Ravens star before settling on George Pickens for the Cowboys



The Dallas Cowboys made headlines with a strategic offseason trade, securing wide receiver George Pickens from the Pittsburgh Steelers in a move aimed at elevating their offensive firepower. Fans are eager to see how Pickens, known for his dynamic playmaking, will pair up with star wideout CeeDee Lamb . But as excitement builds around this fresh duo, it’s now known that Pickens wasn’t the front office’s top target—Baltimore Ravens’ Rashod Bateman had originally been in Dallas’ sights.FOX Sports insider Jordan Schultz confirmed Dallas had initially pursued Rashod Bateman. “During their pursuit of a receiver, the #Cowboys also looked into a trade for #Ravens WR Rashod Bateman,” Schultz shared via social media. “Those talks didn't go far, and Dallas ultimately struck a post-draft deal with the #Steelers for George Pickens.” According to Schultz, the Cowboys' effort to land a wideout had been part of a “months-long process.”The pursuit of Bateman was no surprise given his recent surge in performance. Bateman posted a career-high 756 receiving yards in 2024 and recorded nine touchdowns, securing the second spot on the Ravens’ receiving leaderboard. He extended his strong form into the postseason with two more touchdowns, underlining his value as a red-zone asset.Though injuries have plagued parts of his four-year NFL career, Bateman’s totals—138 receptions, 1,923 yards, and 13 touchdowns—demonstrate consistency and a skill set that could have meshed seamlessly with Prescott’s offensive rhythm. His route-running, in particular, would have added precision to Dallas' aerial attack.But when trade talks with Baltimore lost traction, Dallas turned its attention to Pickens, whose upside and youth offered a different kind of promise. The Cowboys ultimately struck a deal that sent a 2026 third-round and a 2027 fifth-round pick to Pittsburgh in exchange for Pickens, while also receiving a 2027 sixth-round selection from the Steelers.Pickens enters the fold with undeniable playmaking ability. Known for his acrobatic catches and fearless contested grabs, he had moments of brilliance in Pittsburgh despite the team's instability at the quarterback position. His physicality, vertical threat potential, and highlight-reel hands give Dallas the kind of weapon that can stretch defenses and draw attention away from Lamb.However, the former Steeler also brings with him some off-field concerns. Questions surrounding his maturity and emotional control have trailed him since his college days and persisted throughout his early NFL career. For Pickens to thrive alongside Lamb and Prescott, proving he can maintain composure and focus will be essential.Still, there’s no denying the upside of this pairing. With Lamb commanding double coverage and Prescott’s willingness to air it out, Pickens could quickly become a breakout star in Dallas. The Cowboys' front office, often cautious with future draft picks, took a calculated gamble with this move—one that could pay dividends if Pickens evolves into the reliable WR2 they need.Although the Bateman deal didn’t materialize, Dallas may have found a higher-ceiling option in Pickens, provided he grows into the role. With the 2025 season looming, the Cowboys’ offense suddenly looks more explosive—and more dangerous—than it did just a few weeks ago.Also Read: Shedeur Sanders opens up on hate he receives, says ‘99% of hatred’ is actually directed at dad Deion",Dallas cowboys signed wide receiver george pickens from the pittsburgh steelers.

From sweet to sour: Distress crops up as watermelon & muskmelon yield withers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/from-sweet-to-sour-distress-crops-up-as-watermelon-muskmelon-yield-withers/articleshow/121071438.cms,"Congratulations!

In the fertile plains along the Ghaghara river, a silent crisis has gripped farmers, primarily in Barabanki and adjoining areas of Sitapur district. Once heralded as a goldmine, watermelon and muskmelon crops — cash crops that transformed livelihoods — have succumbed to a mysterious affliction, leaving fields littered with rotten, exploded fruits and farmers grappling with confusion and loss.Menthol to Melons: A Lucrative ShiftFor 58-year-old Ramchandra Verma, a farmer from Barabanki’s Gangapur village (Fatehpur tehsil), the journey into hybrid watermelon and muskmelon farming began around 2010. Ditching traditional menthol, which fetched a modest Rs 50,000 per acre, he embraced high-yield melons. By 2018, his gambit paid off as fields yielded 150 quintals (15,000 kg) per acre with a staggering return of Rs 5 lakh per acre.“It was a dream come true. Melons were our ticket to a better life,” Ramchandra recalls.Other farmers followed suit, transforming blocks like Fatehpur, Suratganj, Nindoora, and Dewa into melon hubs. Today, watermelon sprawls across 2,500 hectares, while muskmelon blankets 7,000 hectares, thriving in the riverine soils near Ghaghara.The region became a beacon of agricultural success, with neighboring Sitapur and Ayodhya districts joining in. For years, the sweet, juicy fruit fueled prosperity, until 2025 brought an unprecedented catastrophe.Melons Rotting in the FieldsThe fields that once brimmed with promise have become graveyards for watermelons and muskmelons. Across Barabanki, farmers are reporting a bizarre phenomenon: fruits exploding and rotting on the vine before they can ripen or reach market stalls.“Our fields have become deathbeds. We are confused. Why is this happening? Were the seeds adulterated, or has climate change cursed us,” Ramchandra laments, standing amid wilted vines.The scale of devastation is staggering. Farmers who invested Rs 50,000 to Rs 2.25 lakh per kg on hybrid seeds now face near-total crop failure.Manish Kumar (32), another farmer, says: “I invested Rs 60,000 for muskmelon in four bigha (2.47 acre) and Rs 80,000 for watermelon in eight bigha (4.95 acre). The entire crop is rotting in the field, and I have no idea how to return the loan taken from money lenders and shops from where I bought seeds, pesticide, fertilizer, and mulching sheet.”For one acre, farmers sow 150-200 grams of seeds, five to seven rolls of mulching sheet (each costs Rs 1,500 per roll), 25 kg fertilizer (Rs 1,600) and pesticides depending on the need (average expenditure is Rs 2,500).Hybrid seeds of watermelon such as Saraswati, Anmol and Vishala cost around Rs 60,000-70,000 per kg, while the premium quality Jannat hybrid seed costs up to Rs 2.25 lakh per kg this year, which generally costs Rs 75,000-1.2 lakh. The cheapest was Chirag (Rs 30-35k per kg. In muskmelon, hybrids such as Babi and Muskan which usually cost Rs 80,000 per kg, reached up to Rs 2.25 lakh per kg.Deshraj Verma, a farmer from Kedarpur village (Mahmudabad block) in Sitapur district who also incurred huge loss in melon farming, says: “This year, the price of seeds was exorbitant, as many farmers of neighbouring areas also wished to grow melons. I think we will return to traditional menthol next year onwards.”The Culprit: Fusarium Wilt, Climate, or Bad Seeds?District agriculture authorities are scrambling for answers, but clarity remains elusive. Several theories have emerged, each pointing to a complex web of factors.“District plant protection department is claiming that it’s a fusarium wilt (soil borne fungus) issue, while farmers are claiming that there is an issue with the batch of seeds which was sold this year,” district horticulture officer, Barabanki, Dhirendra Singh tells TOI.District plant protection officer, Barabanki, Vijay Kumar says, “It seems that hybrid seeds (imported from Taiwan) were infected, that’s why there was less supply, and demand spiked. Crops of those farmers survived who used Trichoderma biocontrol agent.”Rajit Ram Verma, district agriculture officer, Barabanki, on Monday issued a circular to all seed distributors, asking them to cooperate in investigating the quality of seeds and provide detailed information about it. Seed distributors have been asked to submit details in three days.“It might not be the seed as all varieties (both Indian and imported) have been infected. It could be soil borne fungus fusarium wilt. Recently, there was rain, and the day temperature is touching 40 degrees Celsius, while temperature goes down in night hours,” he says.“Had the farmers treated the soil with Trichoderma biocontrol agent, their crop could have survived. We advise farmers to conduct crop rotation or leave the soil in open by turning upper surface soil down and let it dry to prevent fusarium wilt,” he adds.","Once heralded as a goldmine, watermelon and muskmelon crops have succumbed to a mysterious affliction. Farmers who invested rs 50,000 to rs 2.25 lakh per kg on hybrid seeds now face near-total crop failure. Culprit: fusarium wilt, or bad seeds. Several theories have emerged, each pointing to a complex web of factors.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121071485,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-12082758,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

"Shedeur Sanders opens up on hate he receives, says ‘99% of hatred’ is actually directed at dad Deion",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/shedeur-sanders-opens-up-on-hate-he-receives-says-99-of-hatred-is-actually-directed-at-dad-deion/articleshow/121071405.cms,"Shedeur Sanders says 99% of the hate he receives is actually directed at his father, Deion Sanders, not him personally. (Credit: @Browns/X)

Shedeur Sanders says most hate he gets is actually aimed at Deion



As Shedeur Sanders starts his NFL journey with the Cleveland Browns , the young quarterback finds himself entangled in a web of criticism that, according to him, has more to do with his famous last name than his own play. The former Colorado standout and 2025 fifth-round pick is determined to change that narrative.Speaking to reporters during the Browns' rookie minicamp, Shedeur Sanders candidly addressed the scrutiny he faces and attributed much of it to his father, Deion Sanders , a Hall of Fame cornerback and current head coach at Colorado.""Ninety-nine percent of hatred is towards Pops,"" Sanders said. ""I'm just his son, so it really just comes from that and I told him that.""His comments point to an unusual burden—being judged not just for what he does on the field but for who raised him. Sanders believes this wave of criticism is mostly generational, coming largely from older fans who associate him with his father’s outsized personality. ""It's the older generation that do it to me rather than the younger people because when I come in person, there's no negativity I see but it's all over online,"" he explained.His draft-day slide became one of the most talked-about stories of 2025. Despite an impressive college career, Sanders fell to the fifth round and was even passed over by his own team, which had already taken Dillon Gabriel in the third. Many analysts speculated that Deion Sanders’ polarizing presence may have played a role in his son's diminished draft stock.Now entering a Browns quarterback room crowded with names like Deshaun Watson, Kenny Pickett, Joe Flacco, and Gabriel, Shedeur has no shortage of competition. Yet, for the first time, he stands without the immediate influence of his father—who coached him from high school through Jackson State and Colorado.His NFL debut will be the true test of his ability to rise beyond the shadow of Deion’s “Prime Time” legacy. While the college spotlight followed Shedeur wherever he went, the NFL presents a clean slate—an opportunity for the younger Sanders to earn respect through action rather than pedigree.In an effort to connect directly with fans and shed the preconceived notions surrounding his name, Sanders has already begun visiting schools in the Cleveland area. The initiative is not just about community engagement—it’s a subtle yet firm statement that he wants to be known for who he is, not just whose son he is.While criticism may be inevitable, Sanders appears ready to take it all in stride. His story isn’t just about football—it’s about identity, perseverance, and a young athlete striving to separate his own legacy from one of the game’s most iconic names. For Shedeur Sanders, this NFL chapter is more than a career move—it’s a chance to finally step out of the shadow and into his own spotlight.Also Read: Shedeur Sanders looks sharper than Dillon Gabriel at Browns rookie minicamp day 1","Shedeur sanders says 99% of the hate he receives is actually directed at his father, deion sanders, not him personally.

LUCKNOW: It was a chilly Dec morning of 2021 when the cellphone of Priyanka Maurya, a local State Rural Livelihood Mission (SRLM) functionary in Sultanpur, rang.It was a call from a state govt official who broke what was indeed a big news – Priyanka, a local banking correspondent Sakhi (BC-Sakhi), was adjudged the best performing worker in providing mobile banking services to the locals at the peak of the pandemic and was now scheduled to be felicitated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“It was the biggest day of my life. Everything changed since then,” recalls a beaming Priyanka.She moves door to door to help people deposit and withdraw money from their bank accounts and subsequently submits all the records at the local Bank of Baroda branch, which acts as her centre.Priyanka’s individual turnover has often ranged around Rs 2 crore per month – fetching her a commission of around Rs 50,000 per month.“This is a sizable amount that helps me support my family and makes me feel proud,” said Priyanka, who also got felicitated by chief minister Yogi Adityanath in 2022.Priyanka is not alone. UP has nearly 40,000 BC Sakhis who have carried out nearly 13.5 lakh bank transactions in the state. The transaction amount has been a whooping Rs 34,588 crore and the ‘Sakhis’ have earned a commission of nearly Rs 95 crore.The concept of ‘Sakhi’ that seeks to empower women has, in fact, many versions like Vidyut Sakhi, Samuh Sakhi, and Krishi Ajivika Sakhi.Just like BC Sakhis, Vidyut Sakhis are essentially entrusted to collect electricity bills, primarily in rural areas.Rajshree Shukla is one of them.A resident of Silauta village in Barabanki, Rajshree has been offering essential service to her community by collecting electricity bills by going door to door. In the financial year 2024-25, Rajshree collected around Rs 9 crore, which translated into a commission of over Rs 12 lakh annually.The Vidyut Sakhi initiative was launched by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in May 2020. UP now has more than 30,000 identified Vidyut Sakhis. Over 13,900 of them have collected over Rs 1,870 crore in UP in the past four years, earning Rs 24.6 crore in commission, since the launch of the initiative.“The uniqueness of the Sakhi project is its structure. Besides being women oriented, the entire programme is internally well connected,” says Deepa Ranjan, Mission Director of the State Rural Livelihood Mission (SRLM).The Sakhi initiative has also been tweaked to be rechristened as ‘Didi’. For instance, Alpana Devi, a resident of Mandirar village in Bijnor, has been nicknamed ‘Drone Didi’ for her pioneering use of drone technology in rural applications, which has had a significant impact on her community.It all started in 2023 when Alpana joined a local self-help group (SHG) and got an opportunity to get trained in flying drones.Alpana used drones to increase worm productivity, monitor crop health, identify pest infestations, and assess water requirements. This technology enabled the precise application of pesticides and insecticides, reduced labour costs and environmental impact.The approach improved yields and brought about more sustainable varieties. She also applied drone technology for surveying and mapping. Creating detailed land maps helped resolve land problems and improved land management. Her work also included planning and monitoring rural infrastructure projects such as roads and irrigation systems, allowing better implementation and maintenance, according to an internal draft record of SRLM. UP SRLM cadre system identifies and trains local women to become community resource persons. These cadres mobilize rural women into SHGs, fostering collective action and financial discipline. The cadre system creates a robust network that enhances savings, access to credit, and income-generating activities, injecting vitality into the rural economyCadres provide hands-on training in skills like bookkeeping, financial literacy, entrepreneurship, and sustainable livelihood practices (for example, farming, animal husbandry, or handicrafts). This empowers rural women to diversify their income sources beyond traditional agricultureCadres such as Bank Sakhis assist SHG members in opening bank accounts, securing loans and managing funds like the revolving fund and community investment fund provided under DAY-NRLM.By linking SHGs to formal banking systems and govt schemes, the cadre system ensures a steady flow of capital into rural households, encouraging investment in micro-enterprisesThe cadre system supports women in setting up micro-enterprises by helping them develop livelihood business plans and connecting them to markets, technology, and resourcesSRLM cadres work to integrate SHGs with schemes from ministries like agriculture, animal husbandry, and micro, small & medium enterprises. This convergence amplifies the economic impact by providing rural women with assets, subsidies, and technical support, fostering a multiplier effect on rural growthThe Lakhpati Didi Initiative aims to enable SHG members to earn a sustainable annual income of at least Rs 1 lakh, transforming them into ‘Lakhpati Didis’. The UP SRLM cadre system is instrumental in achieving this goalThe cadre system’s efforts have a cascading effect. Empowered women reinvest their earnings into education, healthcare, and household improvements, stimulating local demand and economic activity","Priyanka maurya, a local banking correspondent sakhi (bc-sakhi), was adjudged the best performing worker in providing mobile banking services.

When you meet Dr Parul Saxena , a physician in the home guards department who lives on the SGPGIMS premises, you see calmness and confidence. But behind her composed demeanour lies a journey of struggle, tough choices, and deep love. Her only son was diagnosed with high-functioning Asperger’s Syndrome, a form of autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) that affects communication and social interaction.“At first, everything seemed normal. Until the age of one, there were no signs. But then I noticed regression in speech and repetitive behaviour. A team of experts in New Delhi confirmed the diagnosis — a moment that shattered me emotionally, despite my medical training. As a physician, I understood the technicalities. But as a mother, I was devastated. There’s no cure — only support, therapy, and patience.”Dr Parul and her husband, a neurosurgeon, were doing well in Delhi but the diagnosis changed everything. They moved closer to family, and she took a year-long career break. “It wasn’t easy. Professionally, I was thriving, but early intervention was critical. My child needed me more than my job did.”They followed a structured therapy plan — speech therapy, occupational therapy, and special education. Regular visits to Delhi every three months helped track his progress. Slowly, signs of improvement began to show. Today, her son studies at a campus school and thrives as a talented tabla player.“Every small improvement — a new word or a social gesture — is a victory,” she says, eyes glowing with pride. She adds that living on a medical campus helped — there was empathy and understanding. But outside that bubble, awareness remains low. “People judge or question your parenting. But I’ve learned to ignore it. No one is at fault. Every child is different, and every journey deserves respect.”Her biggest challenge? Balancing work and caregiving. “Even now, every day is a juggling act. But the smile on my child’s face gives me strength,” she says.Asked about the message she would like to give on Mother’s Day, she says: “Support your child unconditionally, seek help early, and never be ashamed. Our children are not broken, they are different. And with love, they can bloom.”For Tanu Goel Srivastava , a legal professional from Chowk in Lucknow, the journey began with confusion and concern. Her only son showed food texture preferences and mild speech delay around two-and-a-half years of age. “At first, I thought he was just a picky eater. But soon, we realised it was more than that.”A detailed evaluation confirmed he was neurodivergent and likely on the autism spectrum. Tanu, Section In-Charge in the Legal/HR department of a PSU, faced a tough choice—continue her job or become a full-time caregiver. She chose the latter. “It was both the hardest and the easiest decision. Hard, because I worked so hard to reach where I was. Easy, because my child needed me,” she recalls. Occupational and behavioural therapies began. But unlike quick results expected in the professional world, progress was slow and unpredictable. “Some days were tough but I learned to slow down and take each day as it comes.”Tanu, wife of a corporate employee, believes society still struggles to understand the needs of neurodivergent children. “My child is often left out — no birthday party invites. At school, he tries to participate but often needs handholding. The attitude of other parents matters. Their lack of cooperation hurts.”Despite Indian laws mandating inclusive education, she says the ground reality is different. “There’s a lack of sensitivity. We need awareness — not just among teachers but among parents of neurotypical kids too.” Financially , the family managed; emotionally, they leaned on each other. “My husband, family, and close friends became my pillars,” she adds.Tanu dreams of a future where her son is independent —understanding money, managing daily tasks, and, most importantly, feeling accepted. Her advice to other mothers is that they should start with their own mental health.“Read, ask, learn. Stay involved in therapy. Your child will thrive if you are strong. Happy mothers raise joyous children,” she says. Riya (name changed), an assistant manager in a leading firm in Noida, left her job just before the pandemic. Her only son, now 10, was diagnosed with autism after she noticed signs like limited communication, social withdrawal, and a strong aversion to loud sounds. “He was physically active, but something felt off. At a family wedding, while other kids played, he sat alone with a phone. Then he stopped speaking altogether,” she says.Wife of a businessman, Riya sought assessments, enrolled him in special education, and began therapy. But finding skilled professionals was a hurdle. “Many centres had untrained staff. That wasted precious time,” she says.With her husband’s support, she left her job. “It was emotionally hard. I studied and worked so much. But no one understood my child the way I did. I had to be there,” she says.Her days revolved around therapy sessions, school prep, and managing behavioural triggers. “Even now, he struggles to express discomfort. If he’s hungry or unwell, he won’t say it. That can be scary,” says Riya, who remains optimistic despite challenges. Her son now attends school and is making steady progress. “He’s calmer and learning. But as he grows, expectations — and challenges — keep rising,” she says. “All expenses were out of my own pocket. I wasn’t even aware that any govt programme existed. That’s another issue — we don’t know where to turn. Society must do more than offer sympathy. Don’t pity our children. Talk to them. Include them.Understand them. They are different, not inferior to anyone,” Riya says. “I’ve accepted this life. I no longer grieve for my lost career. I celebrate every step my son takes forward,” she says. Her message to mothers: “You don’t need to be perfect — just be present. Be patient, loving, and always believe in your child.”","Dr parul saxena's son was diagnosed with high-functioning asperger’s syndrome.
