Yes, timely support makes a difference No, some outcomes are unavoidable

LUCKNOW/SHILLONG/INDORE: First, it was a case of missing honeymooners in Meghalaya. They might have lost their way on a trek, it was thought.On June 2, as Raja Raghuvanshi's body was found in a gorge, it was suspected to be a robbery gone wrong. A 'dao' (machete) and phone lay near his body, and a blood-stained raincoat found a few kilometres away. His gold ring and chain, it turned out, were missing. As cops dug deeper, the case took a chilling turn.Also read: ‘Happy to marry whoever you choose,’ Sonam had told father Police formed an SIT with SDRF, NDRF, and central and state intelligence units to crack what became a nationwide sensation. Both families demanded a CBI probe. Even after cops claimed to have cracked the case Monday and arrested Raghuvanshi's bride, Sonam, from a dhaba in UP, and four suspects, including her alleged lover Raj Kushwaha, the stories kept coming. She initially told Ghazipur police that miscreants robbed and killed Raja near the falls, but refused to disclose where she had been or how she escaped.""I didn't kill my husband. They killed him for the jewellery,"" Sonam said, referring to the four arrested men. Those were Akash Rajput, 21, from Lalitpur (UP), Vishal Singh Chauhan, 22, and Kushwaha, 21, both from Indore, and Anand Kurmi, 23, from Satna in MP.Indore additional DCP Rajesh Dandotiya said Akash, Vishal and Raj were produced in court and sent on seven-day transit remand.Anand is being brought to Indore & will be presented in court Tuesday.Raj, suspected to be the prime co-conspirator, used to live near Sonam's home and worked as an accountant in Sonam's family business. He moved away a year ago but remained employed. Police claimed Sonam's family was against her relationship with Raj. Eventually, her marriage was arranged with Raja through a Kushwaha community network.Just four days after her wedding, Sonam returned to her parental home for a post-marriage ritual. She allegedly plotted her husband's murder with Raj during that visit. The plot, investigators alleged, was to eliminate him in the next few days so she could reunite with Raj.East Khasi Hills SP Vivek Syiem alleged Sonam had been sending her location to Raj throughout the trip. Investigators believe the killers trailed the couple after they visited Kamakhya temple in Guwahati. Raj remained in Indore, while Akash, Vishal and Anand travelled by train to Assam, police alleged.""The murder weapon was purchased in Guwahati,"" an officer in Indore said. Sonam reportedly pushed Raja to extend their stay in Shillong - a move now seen as part of a premeditated plan.Tourist guide Albert Pde told investigators he saw the couple with three Hindi-speaking men on May 23 as they climbed 3,000 steps from Nongriat to Mawlakhiat. That detail was key - pointing to outsiders shadowing the honeymooners.""All the dots connected to indicate that there was prior planning,"" SP Syiem said. ""We will confirm everything once the accused are interrogated together."" Sonam's parents dismissed the allegations. Her father Devi Singh said his daughter is being ""framed"" by police.","Raja raghuvanshi's body was found in a gorge in meghalaya on june 2.

NEW DELHI: The mother of Raj Kushwaha, the 21-year-old accused of conspiring with Sonam Raghuvanshi in the alleged murder of her husband Raja Raghuvanshi, has claimed her son is innocent and being falsely implicated.In an emotional appeal, Chunni Bai, 52, said her son had been the sole caretaker of the family since her husband died in 2020.“He looked after his three sisters and started working at Govind’s office,” she said, referring to Sonam’s brother. “My son is not like that.

Who is Zeeshan Akhtar? Key conspirator in Baba Siddique murder held in Canada; linked to Bishnoi gang,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/who-is-zeeshan-akhtar-key-suspect-in-baba-siddique-murder-held-in-canada-linked-to-bishnoi-gang/articleshow/121790642.cms,".

Who is Zeeshan Akhtar

Zeeshan Akhtar is a 22-year-old from Punjab.

He is accused of being a key conspirator in Baba Siddique’s murder.

Police say Akhtar planned the killing, managed finances through more than 10 bank accounts, and coordinated with other accused.

He worked closely with jailed shooter Gurmel Singh and helped arrange weapons and shelter for the attackers.

Akhtar reportedly left Mumbai a month before the murder to avoid raising suspicion.

He is linked to the Lawrence and Anmol Bishnoi gang.

Akhtar is the second accused to be detained in Canada after Anmol Bishnoi.

Zeeshan Akhtar has been detained in Canada in connection with the murder of NCP politician Baba Siddique. Akhtar was reportedly held on the basis of an Interpol notice and has been in Canadian police custody for over a week.Baba Siddique, 66, was shot dead on October 12 last year outside his son's office in Bandra (East), Mumbai. Three assailants carried out the attack. His son had alleged that a builder lobby involved in a Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) project was responsible, but police ruled out this angle. Instead, their chargesheet pointed to Lawrence Bishnoi's Canada-based brother Anmol as the mastermind, linking the murder to Siddique's alleged connections with Dawood Ibrahim and actor Salman Khan.So far, 26 people have been arrested from different parts of the country, including Pune, Uttar Pradesh’s Bahraich, Haryana, Dombivli and Karjat. They include Shivkumar Gautam alias Shiva, who is accused of firing the shots. All 26 are facing charges under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA).","Zeeshan akhtar, 22, is accused of being a key conspirator in baba siddique's murder.

SRINAGAR: Srinagar’s Tagore Hall reverberated with chants of ‘Lal Salam’ on Wednesday as CPM held a one-day convention calling for the restoration of Article 370 and initiation of dialogue with Pakistan.The convention stood out as a rare political event in Kashmir Valley, where even most of the regional parties have largely shifted discourse to demanding the restoration of statehood rather than raising the issue of restoring J&K’s special status.Addressing party workers at the event, titled ‘Convention for the Restoration of Legitimate Constitutional Rights of the People of Jammu and Kashmir’, CPM general secretary M Alexander Baby said the abrogation of Article 370, which granted special status to J&K, amounted to betrayal. “Before adding it into the Constitution of India, Article 370 was thoroughly deliberated upon and agreed to,” Baby said.He hit out at Union home minister Amit Shah for claiming that the abrogation of Article 370 had brought peace and development to Kashmir.Baby, accompanied by several party MPs and other functionaries, also visited border areas in Uri to assess the destruction caused by Pakistani shelling during Operation Sindoor.He said the compensation offered to affected residents was inadequate. “Govt is providing only Rs 1.3 lakh for damaged houses and residential structures. That amount is meagre,” he said, adding that party MPs would raise the issue in the Lok Sabha.The CPM leader, who also met family members of Adil Shah, the ponywallah killed in Pahalgam terror attack, said Kashmiris had been fighting terrorism for years, but the current administration had marginalised elected representatives of the state. During the security review meetings, it’s the LG, a nominee of the Centre, who chaired the meeting, while the elected chief minister Omar Abdullah was excluded, Baby said, adding that “this only emboldens the terrorists”.Baby asserted that terrorism must be fought, but war was not a solution. “Military options are limited. On May 7, certain steps were taken, but we must stop there and begin negotiations,” he said, calling for bilateral talks between India and Pakistan. Rejecting any third-party intervention, he said US President Donald Trump shouldn’t have any role.CPM leader from Kashmir, M Y Tarigami, also criticised the central govt for bifurcating J&K and stripping it of statehood and special status. “This is the only region in the country where such a reversal (from state to Union Territory) has happened. Elsewhere, UTs have been upgraded to full states,” Tarigami said.",Srinagar’s tagore hall reverberated with chants of ‘lal salam’ on wednesday.

In a historic first, Indian-origin doctor Bobby Mukkamala has been sworn in as the 180th president of the American Medical Association (AMA).He is the first physician of Indian heritage to lead the influential organisation.The appointment comes just months after Mukkamala underwent surgery for an 8-cm brain tumour, according to the American Medical Association. Reflecting on his journey, he said, “As I lay in recovery from brain surgery at the Mayo Clinic, with tubes and wires monitoring my every movement, this night — this honour — this opportunity to improve health care seemed a very distant dream.”Addressing AMA members and guests, he underlined the urgent need to reform the US healthcare system. “There are tremendous gaps in our health care system that require our attention,” he said. “That’s why continuing to fight for adequate health coverage for our patients is so important... and why fighting for a sustainable, equitable health care model is so important.”Mukkamala has been a longstanding advocate within the AMA, chairing the Substance Use and Pain Care Task Force and working on evidence-based policies to combat the overdose crisis.His public service work includes leading the Community Foundation of Greater Flint during the water crisis, with a focus on projects that helped mitigate the impact of lead on children.Born to Indian immigrant doctors, Mukkamala credited his parents' sacrifices and his hometown of Flint for shaping his career. “I stand here tonight on the shoulders I quite literally stood on as a kid,” he said. “Those of my parents, Apparao and Sumathi, two immigrants from India who settled in this country believing it offered them — and their future children — opportunities that simply were not possible at home.”Mukkamala completed his medical degree at the University of Michigan and residency at Loyola University in Chicago and returned to Flint to practise medicine alongside his wife, Nita Kulkarni, an obstetrician-gynaecologist. The couple have two sons, Nikhil, a biomedical engineer, and Deven, a PhD candidate in political science.Mukkamala also used his first speech as AMA president to highlight rising health disparities in underserved cities like Flint. “Life expectancy in Flint is about 12 years shorter than its suburbs,” he said, adding that he and his wife have witnessed those disparities firsthand through their work.He warned that more doctors may leave private practice because of financial problems and a growing shortage of physicians.“Where are our patients supposed to turn?” he asked, recounting how a patient preferred to wait six weeks for his return after surgery than seek alternative care.As president, Mukkamala plans to continue advocating for accessible, affordable care and greater government investment in research and public health. “Our patients deserve better. Our physicians deserve better. Our nation deserves better,” he said.",Bobby mukkamala is the 180th president of the american medical association.

NEW DELHI: Project Pelican, a major investigation conducted by Peel Regional Police, has busted a big narco-terror network based out of Canada and individuals suspected to be Khalistan sympathisers. While the operation led to the largest ever drug seizure there with 479 kg of cocaine valued at $47.9 million, nine individuals including seven Indian-origin men settled in Canada have been arrested.The investigation has revealed that the network exploited commercial trucking routes from the US to Canada, with ties to Mexican cartels and US-based distributors, the Peel police said.The proceeds from drug trafficking were being used to finance anti-India activities, including protests and referendums besides funding for weapons, sources said. Intelligence sources pointed towards an ISI-backed plan where Khalistani groups in Canada are being funded to traffick high value Mexican cocaine. The ISI has also been been found pushing Afghan-grown heroin.The arrested men include Sajgith Yogendrarajah, 31, of Toronto; Manpreet Singh, 44, of Brampton; Philip Tep, 39, of Hamilton; Arvinder Powar, 29, of Brampton; Karamjit Singh, 36, of Caledon; Gurtej Singh, 36, of Caledon; Sartaj Singh, 27, of Cambridge; Shiv Onkar Singh, 31, of Georgetown and Hao Tommy Huynh, a 27-year-old from Mississauga.They face a total of 35 charges related to firearm and drug offences, the Canadian police said.Last Dec, two Canadian nationals of Indian origin were arrested when US Illinois State Police found over 1,000 pounds of cocaine in their Volvo truck: something which alerted the investigators to the smuggling ring involving ISI which patronised illegal poppy cultivation in Afghanistan to help Taliban fight the US and Afghan troops.The current investigation began in June 2024, focusing on a cocaine smuggling operation using US-Canada commercial trucking routes. By Nov, multiple individuals, trucking companies, and storage sites linked to the operation were identified with the help of Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and the US Drug Enforcement Administration.Significant seizures were made between Feb and May 2025, including 127 kg of cocaine at the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor and 50 kg at the Blue Water Bridge in Point Edward, the Peel police said in a statement. Additional seizures were made across the Greater Toronto area, with some individuals arrested in possession of loaded firearms.""A total of 479 kg of bricked cocaine, worth an estimated $47.9 million, was seized, along with two illegal loaded semi-automatic handguns. The accused were held for a bail hearing at the Ontario Court of Justice in Brampton,"" the Peel police said.Michael S Kerzner, solicitor general of Ontario, praised the operation, stating, ""Project Pelican is proof of what police can accomplish when they have the tools and resources needed to keep our communities safe.""",The operation led to the largest ever drug seizure there with 479 kg of cocaine valued at $47.9 million.

'No remorse whatsoever': Gangster Goldy Brar's cold confession on Sidhu Moosewala murder; a rival gang angle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-remorse-whatsoever-gangster-goldy-brars-cold-confession-on-sidhu-moosewalla-murder-a-rival-gang-angle/articleshow/121777663.cms,"Poll Do you believe that gang-related violence is a major issue in India today? Yes No

N EW DELHI: Canada-based gangster Goldy Brar justified killing popular Sidhu Moosewala by claiming that the popular Punjabi singer ""had to face the consequences of his actions. ""In a BBC documentary, it was revealed that Lawrence Bishnoi and Moosewala's relationship dated back a long time, and the dreaded gangster used to call the singer from jail, telling him he liked his music.""In his arrogance, he (Moosewala) made some mistakes that could not be forgiven,"" Brar told the BBC.""We had no option but to kill him. He had to face the consequences of his actions. It was either him or us. As simple as that,"" he added.Brar, who is also a member of Lawrence Bishnoi gang, said that the ""first dispute"" between Moosewala and Bishnoi began with a match of Kabaddi in a village in Punjab.Brar said that Moosewala had promoted the tournament which was organised by Bishnoi's rivals - the Bambiha gang.""That's a village our rivals come from. He was promoting our rivals. That's when Lawrence and others were upset with him. They threatened Sidhu and said they wouldn't spare him,"" Brar said.The dispute was resolved by an associate of Bishnoi Vicky Middukhera. Later, Middukhera was himself gunned down by gangsters in Mohali in August 2021, by which point, Bishnoi's hostility towards Sidhu Moosewala reached the point of no return.The Bambiha gang claimed responsibility for killing Middukhera. The police named Moosewala's friend and sometime manager Shaganpreet Singh on the charge sheet, citing evidence that Singh had provided information and logistical support to the gunmen. Singh later fled India and is believed to be in Australia. Moosewala denied any involvement.The Punjab police told the BBC there was no evidence linking Moosewala to the killing or any gang-related crime. But Moosewala was friends with Shaganpreet Singh, and he was never able to shake off the perception that he was aligned with the Bambiha gang — a perception that may have cost him his life.""Everyone knew Sidhu's role, the police investigating knew, even the journalists who were investigating knew. Sidhu mixed with politicians and people in power. He was using political power, money, his resources to help our rivals. We wanted him to face punishment for what he'd done. He should have been booked. He should have been jailed. But nobody listened to our plea,"" Brar said.""So we took it upon ourselves. When decency falls on deaf ears, it's the gunshot that gets heard. Law. Justice. There's no such thing,"" he says. ""Only the powerful can... (obtain) justice, not ordinary people like us,"" he added.He went on to say that even Vicky Middukhera's brother, despite being in politics, has struggled to get justice through India's judicial system.""He's a clean guy. He tried hard to get justice for his brother lawfully. Please call him and ask how that's going. I did what I had to do for my brother. I have no remorse whatsoever,"" he said.Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu, popularly known as Sidhu Moosewala, was shot dead in Punjab's Mansa district on May 29. He was killed when he, along with his friend and cousin, was travelling in a jeep to Jawahar Ke village in Mansa. Six shooters waylaid and sprayed bullets at him.After the killing, Goldy Brar, who is a member of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, claimed responsibility for the act.According to the chargesheet filed in the Moosewala murder case, Goldy coordinated with the shooters and plotters, including Bishnoi and Bhagwanpuria.

NEW DELHI: Contrary to earlier speculations that Raj was the main conspirator, sources now suggest he might have been used as a pawn in a bigger plan.They suspect Sonam was planning to elope with someone else, and Raj, unaware of the larger game, ended up facilitating her escape.Investigators probing the murder of Indore transporter Raja Raghuvanshi during his honeymoon in Meghalaya now believe Sonam Raghuvanshi — the victim’s wife — may have orchestrated the entire plot.Senior police officials monitoring the interrogation of all accused said Sonam appears to have manipulated each of them, luring Raj with promises of love and possibly offering others financial incentives.“Sonam appears to have manipulated each one of them, luring Raj through promises of love and possibly enticing others with financial gains,” a senior officer said.Crime branch officials believe Sonam had planned her disappearance in advance. She had allegedly arranged for a flat in Indore where she intended to stay after the murder.She selected the location herself, made the payments, and ensured the hideout remained a secret — even from her co-accused.Interestingly, no one apart from Sonam seems to know the address of this flat. Even those involved in the case are believed to have been kept in the dark.Officials now suspect Sonam remained in Indore for most of the time while her family staged protests and police teams searched for her across states.When she realised the plan was beginning to unravel, she allegedly asked Raj to book her a cab and fled to Uttar Pradesh — where she was eventually traced on June 8.“Raj made payments to cab driver who dropped Sonam in UP on June 6,” an officer said.Indore crime branch officials confirmed they still do not have the exact location of the flat where Sonam stayed while on the run.Sonam briefly switched on her mobile phone near a highway dhaba in Ghazipur on June 9, exposing her location, a UP police officer said.Though the phone was quickly switched off, surveillance cells had already begun tracking her coordinates.""Sonam avoided her own phone after Raja's murder, using borrowed devices to contact Raj Kushwaha and others,"" the officer said.""Before calling her brother from the dhaba owner's phone, she turned on her phone — likely to note a relative's number. This triggered an SOS from Meghalaya and MP police, who alerted us.""The alert helped local teams zero in on the dhaba, leading to her eventual detention.Investigators said Sonam had purchased three phones in Indore — a basic keypad handset and two Android models — using identity documents of co-accused Anand Kurmi.""Raj helped arrange the purchase,"" the officer said.Police verified the purchases through logbook entries at an Indore mobile shop, which matched details in their records.All three phones and their SIM cards were allegedly destroyed in Meghalaya, in what police believe was a deliberate attempt to wipe out digital footprints and evade detection.","Investigators probing the murder of indore transporter raja raghuvanshi now believe sonam may have orchestrated the entire plot.

The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announced that it was making an immediate policy change for green card applicants, keeping in mind the issue of public health. The previous policy was introduced just over a year ago, but now the new rule will be applicable from June 11. What is the new rule? Every new application for a green card requires a new medical examination form. Suppose an application was withdrawn or rejected earlier. The new application of the same person would now require a new medical examination form. But per the existing rule, the medical form remained valid for indefinite time.""Form I-693, Report of Immigration Medical Examination and Vaccination Record, signed by a civil surgeon on or after Nov. 1, 2023, is only valid while the application the Form I-693 was submitted with is pending.
